Place 20 next to the quotient of 100, and lower the divisor by one place, making 100 into 200 by doubling it. Place 20 below this again, and multiply the divisor 200 by the quotient 20 using the method. 2×2=4000, 2×2=400. Subtract this 4400 from the dividend.
729 tsubo remains in the dividend.

Place 3 next to 20 in the quotient, lower the divisor by one place, doubling 20 to make 40. Place 3 below this again, and multiply the divisor by the quotient 3 using the method. 2×3=600, 3×4=120, 3×3=9. When placed in the method, there are 729 tsubo. This is subtracted from the dividend.
Looking at the quotient:
It becomes 123 ken on each side.

Chapter 20: Square Root Method for Circles
For a square area of one sun on each side, or 711, when using the square root circle method to find the diameter, the answer is: diameter of 3 shaku.
In the method, first place 711 tsubo on the right. When divided by the circle method 79, it becomes 900 tsubo. When this is divided using the square root method, the diameter is known to be 3 shaku.

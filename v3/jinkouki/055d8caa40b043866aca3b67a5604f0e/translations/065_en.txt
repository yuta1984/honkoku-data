Chapter 20: Method of Square Root for Circles

○For a square area of one sun per side, or 711, using the square root method for circles to find the diameter
How much is it? Answer: The diameter is three shaku.

Method: First place 711 tsubo on the right. Divide by the circular method factor of 79 to get 900 tsubo.
If you divide this using the square root method, you can determine that the diameter is three shaku.

○Regarding the factor 79: If a circle has a diameter of one shaku, there are 79 tsubo of one sun each.
If you divide one shaku by two, you get five sun. Also, if you divide one bu by two, you get five rin.
If you multiply this by five sun, you get 25. If you multiply this by three shaku, one sun, and six bu, you get 79 tsubo. Therefore, we multiply by 79.

　　　○If you make a round shape from something that is one shaku three sun square, what is the diameter?
　　　Answer: One shaku, four sun, six bu, two rin, five mo. Method: Place 125, and
　　　multiply this by two shaku three sun to get a diameter of one shaku, four sun, six bu, two rin, five mo.

Chapter 21: Method of Cube Root

○Area of 1,728 tsubo
If you make this into equal
length, width, and height,
how much does it become?
　Twelve ken cubic

Method: Place 1,728 tsubo as the dividend, and first examine the place values in the dividend.
Count up as one-ten-one-ten-one-ten as shown in the diagram, and when you see that
"ten" represents the tens place, first place ten in the quotient, and also
ascend to ten in the lower method and place ten. This is placed following the ten in the quotient.
Now, using the method, call the ten in the lower method by the ten in the quotient. Place two hundred.
Also, count up one-ten from the hundred in the method, and call the hundred in the method by the ten in the quotient.
This becomes one-one thousand tsubo. If you subtract this from the dividend and see,
there remains
　　　728 tsubo

Chapter 19: Square Root Extraction Method (Kaiheihō) - Division Using the Quotient-Dividend Method

○There are 15,129 tsubo here
The question asks: if this is made into a square, what would be the side length?
Answer: Each side would be 123 ken

Place 15,129 tsubo as the dividend and first examine the place values. Count as one, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, and when hundred appears twice, establish it as the hundred place and put 100 in the quotient. With 10,000 tsubo and 100, going up again as one, ten, hundred, place 100. Using this square root method, multiply the lower method's 100 by the quotient's 100 to get 10,000 tsubo. Subtract this from the dividend.
Remaining in the dividend:
5,129 tsubo

Place 20 next to the 100 in the quotient, then lower the lower method by one place, double the 100 to make 200, and place 20 below this. Then by the method, multiply the lower method's 200 by the quotient's 20. 2×2 equals 4,000, 2×2 equals 400; subtract this 4,400 from the dividend.
Remaining in the dividend: 729 tsubo

Place 3 next to the 20 in the quotient, lower the lower method by one place, double the 20 to make 40, and place 3 below this. Then by the method, multiply using the quotient's 3 with the lower method. 2×3 equals 600, 3×4 equals 120, 3×3 equals 9. When placed, there are 729 tsubo in the method. Subtract this from the dividend. Looking at the quotient:
It becomes 123 ken per side

《Title: Chapter 38 - About Japan》

○ Number of men: 1,990,948,828 people
○ Number of women: 2,948,820 people
　Total: 4,899,964,848 people

When arranging this number of people in a square formation, how many ken (間) square would it be?
　○ Length: 10 chō (町) 38 ken 6 shaku 4 sun 1 bu 3 rin
　○ Width: 10 chō 38 ken 6 shaku 4 sun 1 bu 3 rin

The calculation method assumes 12 people per tsubo (坪). Dividing 4,899,964,848 people by 12 gives 408,304 tsubo. Using the square root method (kaiheihō), this becomes 638 ken plus a remainder.
Adding 6 shaku 5 sun to this remainder gives 638 ken 6 shaku 4 sun 1 bu 3 rin. Dividing this by 60 ken shows it would be 10 chō 38 ken 6 shaku 4 sun 1 bu 3 rin square.

▲ With the above number of 4,899,964,848 people, assuming each person eats 5 gō of rice per day, the daily consumption would be:
　○ 24,499 koku 2 to 4 shō

And for one year of 354 days:
　○ 8,672,376 koku 9 to 6 shō

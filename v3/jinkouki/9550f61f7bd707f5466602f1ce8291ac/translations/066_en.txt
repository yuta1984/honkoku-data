Place 2 next to the 10 in the quotient. Now triple the 10 in the lower method to make 30. Moving down one place,
multiply the 30 in the lower method by the 10 in the quotient using the method. Place 1×3=30 in the method.
Next to this 30, multiply the 30 in the lower method by the 2 in the quotient. Place 2×3=6. Also, count up
10 from the 30 in the method and multiply the 30 in the method by only the 2 in the quotient. Place 2×3=
600. Also, count up 10 from the 6 in the method and multiply the 6 in the method by the 2 in the quotient. When we place 2×
6=120, it becomes 730. Subtracting this from the dividend leaves 8 tsubo remaining. This should be
subtracted completely. First, in the method, place the 2 from the quotient as 2 in the method as well. Now, multiplying the 2 in the method by the 2 in the quotient
gives 2×2=4, which is placed in the method. Multiplying this by the 2 in the quotient twice more gives 2×4=8 tsubo.
This is what we subtract from the dividend.

When divided by one digit, it becomes twenty ken. Using this twenty ken in multiplication table, if you subtract 2×2=400 tsubo, there remains actually 720 tsubo. Also, doubling the current twenty ken makes it 240 ken. When the actual number is divided by one digit using this, it becomes three ken. These three ken are calculated as 3×3=9 tsubo in the multiplication table and subtracted. Now, multiply the previously doubled portion by five, and leave the three ken that were not doubled as is, making it 123 ken.

Also it is said: When calculating with counting rods, like the abacus method mentioned above, determine the positions for quotient and dividend. The dividend is black, the quotient is red, ones are vertical rods, tens are horizontal. Five in the ones position is horizontal, ten is...

◯For one million cavalry, with two people standing per ken interval, how long would the line extend?
〽The length would be 231 ri, 17 chō, and 20 ken

Method: Divide one million people by two to get 500,000 ken. Divide this by 60 ken to get 8,333 chō and 20 ken. Divide this by 36 chō to find the length is 231 ri, 17 chō, and 20 ken when lined up.

If the same number of people were arranged in two rows, they would extend 115 ri, 26 chō, and 40 ken.
The division method is the same principle as the method for standing one person per interval.

○There are 15,129 tsubo
　If this is made into a square, how much per side would it be?
　　〽It would be 123 ken per side
　　　　　　　Set the actual area as 15,129 tsubo. First examine the place values.
　　　　　　　Count as ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten-thousands, and when it matches,
　　　　　　　if hundreds appears twice, determine it as the hundreds place, and place 100
　　　　　　　in the quotient. Then using the lower method, rising from 100 to tens and hundreds,
　　　　　　　place 100. With this triple method, using the lower method's 100 and the quotient's...

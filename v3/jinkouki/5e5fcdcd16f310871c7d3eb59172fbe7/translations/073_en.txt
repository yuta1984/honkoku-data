▲On the Method of Cube Root Extraction
What is in this book should also be handled skillfully with the right method. However, let me record the abbreviated calculation technique for the abacus.

○Set the actual value as 1,728 tsubo. Considering the positions as ones, tens, hundreds from the tsubo position, thousands corresponds to the ones position. Set 10 ken as the quotient on the right, place it in the calculation above the actual value, square it again to get 1,000 tsubo. Subtract from the actual value, leaving 728 tsubo remaining in the actual value. Now transfer the quotient 10 ken from the law position, multiply by the fixed law 3, and multiply by the quotient 10 ken. Setting it as 300, with the intention of dividing the actual value, consider the next 2 ken.

Consider this and break down the law, newly setting the law as 12 ken. Going down 2 digits, in the 3rd digit, square the current 2 ken and add it, and multiply the law 3 by the above 12 ken or so. Then multiply by the initial quotient 10 ken to get 364. This is what divides the actual value. However, the law is repeatedly reconsidered and reset.

10 means the tens place. First place 10 in the quotient, and also going up as ten in the lower part, place 10. This is placed following the 10 in the quotient. Now in the law, call the 10 in the lower part to the 10 in the quotient. Place 1×1 as 100. Also, counting up ten from the 100 in the law, call the 10 in the quotient to the 100 in the law. It becomes 1×1,000 tsubo. When this is subtracted from the actual value, what remains is 728 tsubo in the actual value.

In the quotient, place 2 next to 10. Now triple the 10 in the lower part to make 30, move down one place, and in the law, call the 10 in the quotient to the 30 in the lower part. Place 1×3 as 30 in the law. Next to this 30, call the 2 in the quotient to the 30 in the lower part. Place 2×3 as 6. Also, counting up ten from the 30 in the law, call only the 2 in the quotient to the 30 in the law. Place 2×3 as 600. Also, going up ten from the 6 in the law, call the 2 in the quotient to the 6 in the law. When placing 2×6 as 120, it becomes 720. When this is subtracted from the actual value,

8 tsubo remain. Extract this as the square. First, in the law, place the 2 from the quotient as 2 in the law as well. Now, multiplying the 2 in the quotient by the 2 in the law gives 2×2 as 4, placed in the law. Multiplying this by the 2 in the quotient twice gives 2×4 as 8 tsubo, which is subtracted from the actual value.

Consider the position of quotient 2.
Place 2 in the quotient. This represents 20 ken. Now multiply this 20 ken by the auxiliary number and add to the divisor to make 22. Multiply this by the current quotient to get 2×2=4,000 tsubo to subtract. 729 tsubo remain in the dividend.

Now, to find the quotient 3, multiply the auxiliary by quotient 2 again and add to the divisor. The divisor becomes 24 and moves down one row. The auxiliary moves down two rows. Consider the position of quotient 3 and place 3 ken. Multiply this 3 ken by the auxiliary and add to the divisor to make 243. Multiply by the current quotient 3 ken: subtract 2×3=600 tsubo, subtract 3×4=120 tsubo, subtract 3×3=9 tsubo, and the result is 123 ken.

《Topic: Chapter 20 - Square Root Method for Circles》
　　　　　○For a square of one sun per side, or 711 tsubo, using the square root circle method, what is the diameter? 〽The diameter is 3 shaku
　　　　　Method: First place 711 tsubo on the right. Divide by the circle factor 79 to get 900 tsubo. Taking the square root of this gives a diameter of 3 shaku.
　　　　　○The reason for 79 is: if a circle has a diameter of 1 shaku, there are 79 squares of 1 sun each. Dividing 1 shaku by 2 gives 5 sun. Dividing 1 sun by 2 gives 5 rin. Multiplying this by 5 sun gives 25. Multiplying this by 3 shaku 1 sun 6 bu gives 79 tsubo, hence we multiply by 79.
　　　　　○For an object that is 1 shaku 3 sun square, when made circular, what is the diameter? 〽1 shaku 4 sun 6 bu 2 rin 5 mō
　　　　　Method: Place 1125. Multiplying this by 1 shaku 3 sun gives a diameter of 1 shaku 4 sun 6 bu 2 rin 5 mō.

《Topic: Chapter 21 - Cube Root Method》
○There are 1,728 tsubo in area
　Making this into equal length, width, and height, what does it become?
　　〽12 ken on all six sides
Method states: Place 1,728 tsubo as the dividend. First examine the positions using the dividend. Count up as ones, tens, ones, tens, like in the diagram, and when examining

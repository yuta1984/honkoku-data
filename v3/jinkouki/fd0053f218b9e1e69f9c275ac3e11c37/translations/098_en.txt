▲Similarly, when making square timber from round wood with a diameter of two shaku five sun, to find what dimensions the corners will be: if you measure with the reverse scale markings of a carpenter's metal ruler, it will be one shaku seven sun six bu seven rin seven mō. This is exactly what you should know as the face of the corner measured with the front scale of the metal ruler.

　　　　▲There is a water vessel that is six shaku long, three shaku wide, and three shaku deep. When making this vessel into a bucket with the depth remaining at three shaku, what diameter will the resulting bucket have?
　　　　　　Top diameter: four shaku eight sun seven bu three rin three mō
　　　　　　Bottom diameter: four shaku six sun seven bu three rin three mō
　　　　　Multiply six shaku length by three shaku to get eighteen. Divide this by 79 to get 2278481. Apply the square root method to get four shaku seven sun three bu three rin three mō. This becomes the diameter. As described above, when the bucket narrows by one sun at the bottom and widens by one sun at the top, the top diameter becomes four shaku eight sun seven bu three rin three mō, and the bottom diameter becomes four shaku six sun seven bu three rin three mō.

▲Also, regarding how much water the above vessel holds:
　　　　It holds eight koku six to four shō
　First multiply the length of six shaku by four to get twenty-four. Also multiply the edge of three shaku by four to get twelve. Multiply this again by twenty-four to get 288. Multiply this by the depth of three shaku to find the answer.

▲Also, when making a bucket, add the top diameter of four shaku eight sun seven bu three rin three mō to the bottom diameter of four shaku six sun seven bu three rin...

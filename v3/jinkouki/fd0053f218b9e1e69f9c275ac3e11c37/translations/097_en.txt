《Title: Chapter 26 - Square Root Methods for Circles》

▲When there is a one-sun square area, or 711 tsubo, and you want to find the diameter using the circle opening method:
　　　　The diameter is three shaku
　　　　Method: First place 711 tsubo on the right, divide by the circle
　　　　coefficient 79 to get 900 tsubo. Apply the square root method
　　　　to find the diameter is three shaku

▲About the number 79: When a circle has a diameter of one shaku, one sun of area contains 79 tsubo
　　　　Dividing one shaku by two gives five sun, and dividing one bu by two
　　　　gives five rin. Multiplying this by five sun gives twenty-five.
　　　　Multiplying this by three shaku one sun six bu gives 79 tsubo, which is why
　　　　we multiply by 79

　　　▲When making a round shape from something that is one shaku three sun square,
　　　　what will the diameter be?
　　　　　The diameter becomes one shaku four sun six bu two rin five mō
　　　Place 125 on the right, and multiply this by one shaku three sun
　　　to get a diameter of one shaku four sun six bu two rin
　　　five mō

▲When making a square from round wood with a diameter of two shaku five sun,
　　　　　　what dimensions will the corners be?
　　　　　　　Each side measures one shaku seven sun six bu seven rin seven mō
　　　　　　Place two shaku five sun on the right and the coefficient
　　　　　　14142 on the left, then divide the two shaku five sun by this
　　　　　　to get each face as one shaku seven sun six bu seven rin seven mō

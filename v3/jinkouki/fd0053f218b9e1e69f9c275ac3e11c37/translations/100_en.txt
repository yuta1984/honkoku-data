Indeed, place the product and when examining the position using the cube method, it is the hundreds place. Set 900 as the quotient. Using the lower method, go up again and set 900 as the cubic method, then multiply the quotient by the lower method. 9×9 = 81,000,000, going up through units, tens, hundreds, and multiply the quotient by the method. 8×9 = 7 gai 2 kyō, 1×9 = 9 chō. Divide by the actual number. The remainder in the actual number is 2 gai 3 kyō 2 chō 5 oku 4 sen 8 hyaku man 3 tsubo.

Multiply 900 of the lower method by 3 to get 2,700. Retreat by one position and place 80 next to 900 in the quotient. Now using the method, multiply all quotients by the lower method. 2×9 = 180,000,000, 2×8 = 16,000, 7×9 = 640,000, 7×8 = 5,600. Take the second method up by units, tens, hundreds and multiply by the quotient 80. 2×8 = 1 gai 6 kyō, 6×8 = 4 kyō 8 chō, 4×8 = 3 chō 2 oku, 6×8 = 4 oku 80,000. Divide by the actual number. Next, perform square subtraction.

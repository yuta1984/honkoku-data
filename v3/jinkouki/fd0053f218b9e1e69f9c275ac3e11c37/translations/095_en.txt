【Diagram of the Square Root Method】
Place the product (tsumori) in the dividend. Units of one, ten, hundred, thousand. In the thousand place of one, ten, hundred, thousand, the first quotient (shoshō)
establishes 8,000, and also places 8,000 in the lower method. When multiplying the quotient by this method, it becomes 8 × 6 kei 4 chō. This is subtracted from the dividend.
　The dividend has a remainder of 1 kei 2 chō 8 oku 2 man 5 sen 2 hyaku 25 tsubo

Double the lower method's 8,000 to make 16,000. Lower it by one place. Using 7 for the next quotient, place 7 next in the lower method. Using 7 from the next quotient position, multiply it by the method
with the lower method. 1×7 equals 7 chō. 6×7 equals 4 chō 2 sen oku. 7×4 oku 9 man. Remove this from the dividend.　The dividend has a remainder of 1 chō 1 oku 3 man 5 sen 2 hyaku 25 tsubo

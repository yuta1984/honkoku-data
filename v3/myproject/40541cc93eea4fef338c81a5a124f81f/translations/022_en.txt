In which imperial reign was it? Among the many imperial consorts and court ladies who served at court, there was one who, though not of the highest rank, was especially favored by the emperor. The imperial consorts who had from the beginning thought "I am the one" regarded her with hatred, looking down upon and envying her. The court ladies of the same rank or lower were even more troubled, and in their morning and evening court service, they must have stirred up people's hearts and accumulated resentment, for she became quite sickly and weak-hearted, frequently returning to her family home. The emperor found this increasingly unsatisfactory and pitiful, paying no heed to people's criticism, showing such favoritism as might become the talk of the world. Even the high court nobles and senior courtiers looked on with meaningless amazement at such dazzling imperial favor. Just as in China such things caused the world to fall into disorder and come to ruin, gradually throughout the realm inconvenient matters became sources of people's distress, and when the example of Yang Guifei began to be cited, there were many unseemly incidents. Yet relying on the emperor's incomparably gracious heart, she continued her court service. Her father, the Major Counselor, had died, and only her mother, the Northern Lady, remained—a person of ancient noble lineage who conducted herself beautifully in all things and managed ceremonies splendidly, not greatly inferior to the most illustrious ladies at court, though she lacked any particularly reliable patron.

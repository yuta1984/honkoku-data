appeared so beautiful that even his rivals could not bring themselves to hate him completely. Those who understood human nature marveled, "So such a person can indeed be born into this world," their eyes widening in amazement. That summer, the Imperial Consort fell ill with what seemed a minor ailment and requested to withdraw from court, but the Emperor absolutely refused to permit it. Since she had suffered from her usual illness for years, His Majesty had grown accustomed to it and kept saying, "Let us wait a while longer and see how it goes." However, she grew worse day by day, and within just five or six days became so weak that her mother tearfully petitioned for her withdrawal from the palace. Even at such a time, fearing unseemly rumors might arise, the Emperor kept the young prince at court while secretly allowing her to depart. Since life has its limits, he could not detain her indefinitely, but the anxiety of seeing her off was beyond description and caused him unbearable pain. This beautiful and lovely person, now terribly wasted away, was deeply sunk in melancholy thoughts, yet could not speak her feelings aloud, and seemed to be fading away.

However, when her attendants urged, "Today we have arranged for eminent priests to perform healing rites. They will begin tonight," he reluctantly allowed her departure despite his anguish. His chest was terribly constricted, he could not sleep at all, and spent the night in agony. Though messengers traveled back and forth constantly, he continued to send endless expressions of concern until, past midnight, word came that she had finally passed away. The crying and wailing that ensued made even the returning messenger feel the futility of it all. Upon hearing this news, the Emperor's distraction was such that he could think of nothing else and shut himself away. Though he desperately wanted to see the young prince even at such a time, it would be inauspicious for the child to remain at court during the mourning period, so arrangements were made for his departure. The Emperor gave no thought to other matters while his attendants wept and lamented, and his own tears flowed without cease. The prince found this strange, but it was only natural

　　　　　　　　Format
Each page presents the base text in size 5 type, and textual variants from various manuscripts are presented separately in size 6 type in the margins of the relevant pages, in the order of Aobyoshi texts, Kawachi texts, and variant texts. When there are too many variants to fit in the margins of the relevant page, only the remainder is collected at the end of each chapter.
Main Text
1. The main text consists of fourteen lines per page, with Arabic numerals indicating line numbers at the bottom of each line.
1. The main text follows the format of the original manuscript without paragraphs, except that poems are always written on a new line indented by two characters. The main text following poems continues directly without starting a new line.
1. An asterisk (*) is placed to the right of the main text to indicate where Fujiwara no Koreyuki's Genji-shaku commentary exists, numbered sequentially from the beginning. The text of Genji-shaku is collected in a separate volume.
1. The original manuscript contains Fujiwara no Teika's postscripts at the end of each chapter, but these are included in a separate volume.
1. The main text preserves the original manuscript exactly, even including apparent errors. However, on page 172, line 10 of Wakamurasaki, where the original reads "sōbu" (僧部), this error was corrected to "sōzu" (僧都), and the original form is noted in the Aobyoshi textual variants. Also, on page 1686, line 3 of Sawarabi, where one character after "atsukena" in the original is damaged by insects, this was interpreted as "to," and the original form is noted in the Aobyoshi textual variants.
1. All variant forms of hiragana used in the original manuscript have been standardized to current standard hiragana forms.
1. In places where katakana is mixed with hiragana in the original manuscript, namely on page 188, line 3 of Wakamurasaki where the original reads "emairikonuwo" (with katakana "wo"), and

on page 1592, line 10 of Agemaki where the original reads "kisai no miya wa ta" (with katakana "ta"), these have been changed from katakana to hiragana as "emairikonuwo" and "kisai no miya wa ta" respectively, and the original forms are noted in the Aobyoshi textual variants.
1. Abbreviated characters, variant characters, and alternative forms of Chinese characters used in the original manuscript, such as:
　　　部　𠄐
　　　條　条
　　　秋　秌　龝
have all been preserved as in the original manuscript.
1. Annotations existing in the main text of the original manuscript, except those clearly identified as collations with other texts or explanatory notes, are all indicated in the Aobyoshi textual variants using fixed symbols for forms such as insertions, strikethroughs, and parallel listings, with notation when done in red ink.

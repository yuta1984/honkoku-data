1. Imaeda Naiki Naomasa writes in his personal record (Kakei): According to someone's account, at the time of Lord Zuiryū's (Maeda Toshinaga) death, there was an intention to return the 200,000 koku of Niikawa District to the shogunate. Lord Bimyō (Maeda Toshitsune) had the same intention regarding returning the 200,000 koku of Komatsu, but he refrained from doing so because both the Awaji-no-kami and Hida-no-kami lords were involved.

1. The marginal note "Kakei" refers to Minbu Chikayoshi. This is recorded based on Chikayoshi's direct account. According to this, Lord Toshitsune designated over 200,000 koku from the two districts of Nomi and Niikawa as retirement territory, following the precedent of Lord Toshinaga's retirement arrangement. However, the matter of Lord Toshinaga returning Niikawa District as retirement territory to the shogunate is not recorded in the various old records of the former domain, so the details are unclear. The "Tanhi lords" refers to both Awaji-no-kami Toshitsugu and Hida-no-kami Toshiharu.

1. In the fourth month of Shōhō 2 (1645), the fourth lord Mitsutaka died, and on the thirteenth day of the sixth month, the heir Inuchiyo succeeded to the inherited domain. At that time he was only three years old, so his grandfather Lord Toshitsune served as regent for domain affairs.

A copy of the personal letter to both chief retainers Honda and Yokoyama is as follows:

Today, the thirteenth day, through the official envoys Sakai Sanuki-no-kami and Matsudaira Izu-no-kami, regarding the matter of succeeding to Chikuzen-no-kami's position: although Inuchiyo is young, he has been appointed without question. Although we are elderly and infirm in our later years, which you may think burdensome, the gracious intention to oversee [the succession] is most gratefully received and fortunate. Please inform the retainers, commanders, and all others of this matter.

Respectfully stated
Sixth month, thirteenth day　　Hizen

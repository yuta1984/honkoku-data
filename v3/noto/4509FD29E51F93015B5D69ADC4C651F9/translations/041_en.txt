One: Regarding the matter of the edict that when Matsudaira Bingo-no-kami takes leave to his domain, henceforth jōshi (senior envoys) and oshiban (inspectors) shall be dispatched.

One: The particulars conveyed to Lord Bingo-no-kami's retainers are as follows:

At that time, a petition was made to the main family regarding promotion in rank assessment and the matter of jōshi and leave to the domain. It was decreed that he be granted a rank assessment of 100,000 koku, as conveyed by the Senior Councillors in session.

The reason for this is that it has been a matter of earnest petition for generations, and he had long been making this request to the main family.

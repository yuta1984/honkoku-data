1. Based on the above correspondence, it can be known that the thirteen villages of ancient shrine lands continued to exist as before up until Tensho 9. Furthermore, a copy of a donation document in the possession of Eikoji Temple in Sakai in the same province is as follows:

"Regarding Wakabe-ho in Noto Province as territory of Dokokudani-san Eikoji Temple, there are annual provisions of rice stipend and money. However, according to the main intent of the donation document by the former Mimasaka-no-kami on the 25th day of the 11th month of Kosho 2, there should be no discrepancies. Therefore, the document is as stated.

1. Upon examination, the above-mentioned Eikoji Temple territory of Wakabe-ho in Hakui District was land donated by Emperor Go-Daigo in Genko 3. Regarding the history of Eikoji Temple, various sources state that when Lord Toshiie entered the province, he listened carefully to the temple's history and the successive donations of Wakabe-ho, converted the rice tribute from Wakabe-ho and reformed it to a 300-koku assessment, granting a donation seal document. However, this seal document was lost in a fire at the temple, and during the period without a resident priest, Lord Toshitsune ordered a land survey. Considering it excessive temple territory for a temple without a resident priest, the 300-koku land was confiscated, and 20-koku of rice fields in Sakai village were granted as maintenance funds for a caretaker priest.

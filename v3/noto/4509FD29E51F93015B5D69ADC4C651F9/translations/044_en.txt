three hundred years, holding the highest position among all daimyo in Japan, which is
　　　the manifestation of the accumulated virtuous deeds of our founding ancestor.
　　　Therefore, a certain retainer, acting as Keishū, inquired about the sequence of beneficial grants.
　　　Upon secretly examining this, during the initial military upheavals and disturbances of the founding period,
　　　the military officials did not engage in scholarly pursuits, so historical records missed a hundred details for every one recorded,
　　　making it impossible to obtain the particulars. However, now Keishū has fortunately received orders to compile
　　　what caught the eye from the various records of Etchū, Noto, and Kaga provinces and
　　　presented this work. Twenty-eighth day of mid-autumn, Bunka 9. Recorded by Tomita Keishū

　One: According to Heiji's analysis, among the former domains, the four houses of Shimazu, Date, Mōri, and Uesugi
　　　formerly ruled fiefs of several provinces and were the great domains of the realm. However, during the Toyotomi period,
　　　their territories were reduced, and particularly the Uesugi house had their fief progressively diminished, becoming a minor house.
　　　Since Tenshō, only our former domain has continuously increased its fief without any reduction of territory. Indeed, since the

　　　founding, the three provinces of Kaga, Noto, and Etchū with twelve districts, plus
　　　Imazu territory in Takashima District of Ōmi Province, totaling the bakufu vermillion seal land assessment,
　　　excluding the 170,000 koku of the two cadet branches of Toyama and Daishōji, the main
　　　Kanazawa house's fief tax assessment amounts to 1,025,020 koku 2 to 8 shō
　　　2 gō. Some say that in the old bakufu's Edo-published Bukan, the Maeda house's
　　　territorial holdings are recorded as 1,022,700 koku held for generations, but this amount
　　　represents the three provinces of Kaga, Noto, and Etchū, excluding the over 2,300
　　　koku of Imazu territory in Gōshū. From Keichō 5 until the Meiji Restoration,
　　　spanning approximately 270 years, as the greatest domain in the realm,
　　　we have maintained peace and tranquility, preserving the ancestral altars for fourteen generations.
　　　This is entirely due to the accumulated virtuous deeds and benevolence of our domain founder, the Vice-Minister of high virtue.

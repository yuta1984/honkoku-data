On April 15th of the same year, as Matsudaira Higo resisted the imperial forces and Satsuma-Chōshū forces were directed toward the Hokuriku road, orders were issued to pacify the northern provinces. On the 28th of the same month, by imperial decree, 130,000 ryō in gold was transported for the expenses of imperial forces dispatched to Hokuetsu. On July 22nd of the same year, when advancing toward the Echigo front, 20,000 bales of white rice were needed by order of the Commander-in-Chief Prince, so they were urgently transported to Kashiwazaki headquarters. 《Abbreviated》

On June 2nd of the second year [Meiji 2], for deploying troops during last summer's subjugation of rebels in Hokuetsu and for transporting money and grain by imperial command, a reward stipend of 15,000 koku was granted in perpetuity, as announced through an official document.

On the 4th of the same month, regarding the aforementioned reward, feeling unbearable shame during these times of enormous national expenses, a petition was made to return it. However, through an official notation, it was declared that the matter of returning the reward stipend would not be subject to discussion, as it was granted out of profound imperial appreciation for meritorious service, etc.

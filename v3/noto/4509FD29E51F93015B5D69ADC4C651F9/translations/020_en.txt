Awaji-no-kami received 100,000 koku and Hida-no-kami received 70,000 koku as their portions. Regarding this matter of the vermillion seal, we will comply with whatever the government decides to order. However, when I privately consulted with Awaji-no-kami and Hida-no-kami, both expressed their desire to receive individual vermillion seals, so please take note of this.

1. In the villages of Imazu and Hirokawa within Takashima District of Ōmi Province, we have held domain rights over 2,260 koku and 2 to [measures] since ancient precedent. We would like this to be included in the current vermillion seal. Furthermore, we are submitting the land registers for the entire divided domain, so please provide guidance on all aspects of the investigation.

We will have a clean copy prepared and submitted accordingly.
Regarding the above vermillion seal matter, though we should have promptly submitted our request, as we communicated through Okada Bunzen-no-kami the other day, we have delayed in order to first consult with Awaji-no-kami before submitting. We have also reported the details to the Council of Elders, so please take note of this. The above.

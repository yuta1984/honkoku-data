1. According to the "Sanshū-shi" (Three Provinces Chronicle), in the 3rd month of Kan'ei 16 (1639), the lord (Toshitsune) went to Edo, and on the 17th day of the 5th month (or the 16th day according to another source), by imperial command through the envoy Hotta Kaga-no-kami Masamori, he was granted retirement at Komatsu Castle. The lord, at the noble age of 47, on the 20th day of the 6th month transferred 800,000 koku from the three provinces of Kaga, Etchu, and Noto to his heir for succession, making 222,760 koku from Niikawa and Nomi districts his retirement fief. From the late Zuiryū-kō's retirement domain, he granted 100,000 koku to Lord Tositsugu and established Toyama as his castle residence, and granted 70,000 koku [to Tosiharu]. In the following year (Kan'ei 17), in the 6th month, Chōmyō-kō entered Komatsu Castle, and in the winter of the 10th month, Lord Tositsugu entered his fief at Toyama. The accompanying retainers relocated daily.

1. According to the "Toyama Domain Genealogy," the founding ancestor Awaji-no-kami Tositsugu, on the 20th day of the 6th month of Kan'ei 16, received 100,000 koku as a divided domain from his father Toshitsune. Thereafter he was called Momozuka Jijū. In the 10th month of the following 17th year, he entered Toyama domain and temporarily resided in Toyama Castle. In Manji 2 (1659), he fixed his residential castle at Toyama, and in the 4th year of the same era, castle construction was undertaken by petition.

1. According to the "Yamazaki Main Genealogy," at the time of entering the domain in Kan'ei, the territory consisted of: 60,000 koku from one line of Nei District in Etchu Province, 16,800 koku from the Urayama area of Niikawa District, 3,220 koku from the Toyama area, and 20,000 koku from within Nomi District of Kaga Province. If this is the case, 100,020 koku would be the assessed total. Momozuka in Etchu was designated as the castle site, but it later became Toyama.

1. According to the "Consideration of Fief Succession Order," regarding the territorial division of both lords Tositsugu and Tosiharu in Kan'ei 16, the 100,000 koku Toyama portion is recorded and inscribed in the Nei District territory this year.

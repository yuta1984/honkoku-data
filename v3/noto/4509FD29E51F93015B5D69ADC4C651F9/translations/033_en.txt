He was pardoned and, responding to the Tokugawa family's command, rushed to Kaga Province and exerted his utmost efforts. This was because he was related by marriage to Chūnagon Toshinaga-kyō. After the Battle of Sekigahara, Takahisa came with Toshinaga-kyō to the military camp at Ōtsu for an audience, and in recognition of his meritorious service, he was granted a domain of 10,000 koku in Kaga Province. Later, because there was convenience for falconry, Toshinaga-kyō requested that Takahisa's domain be exchanged to Noto Province. Subsequently, he received additional grants: 10,000 koku in Mie District of Ise Province and 7,000 koku in Kurita District of Ōmi Province, totaling 27,000 koku. On the 12th day of the 11th month of Keichō 13 (1608), Takahisa died at the age of fifty-six. His eldest son, Tango-no-kami Takauji, inherited 10,000 koku in Mie District of Ise and 2,000 koku in Kurita District of Ōmi from his father's domain, totaling 12,000 koku. Takahisa's second son, Kamon-no-kami Takeshige, served the Tokugawa family from Keichō 9 (1604) and was allocated 10,000 koku in Noto Province and 50 koku in Ōshū from his father's domain. On the 28th day of the 9th month of Genna 8 (1622), he was granted an additional 5,000 koku in Iwaki as a favor, totaling 20,000 koku.

On the 9th day of the 12th month of Kan'ei 5 (1628), he died at the age of thirty-seven, and his son Kawachi-no-kami Takatsugu inherited his father's domain. His children were the eldest son Yamashiro-no-kami Takanao and the second son Minbu [name unknown].
Upon current examination, the 10,000 koku in Kaga Province was perhaps mistakenly heard as Etchū Province.
According to the Sanshū-shi Raiin Gairan: In Keichō 5 (1600), Zuiryū-kō granted 10,000 koku including Nunoichi village in Niikawa District of Etchū Province to Hijikata Kanbē Takahisa. Takahisa was later ennobled and called Kawachi-no-kami. The Hakuseki Shinsho records him as Hijikata Hikoemon. In Keichō 11 (1606), because it interfered with the falconry grounds, Zuiryū-kō exchanged it for land in Noto. At this time, a jinya (local administrative office) was built in Yamazaki Village of Kashima District. In Tennā 1 (1681), Takahisa's fourth-generation descendant Iga-no-kami Takataka allocated 1,000 koku from within the 10,000 koku of Noto to his younger brother Minbu Takayoshi. Later, he allocated 150 koku from within the 1,000 koku to Minbu's second son Chōjūrō. When the three Hijikata families were established side by side, in Jōkyō 1 (1684)...

Lord Honda Awa-no-kami
Lord Yokoyama Yamashiro-no-kami

1. According to the "Sanshū Shishi": On the thirteenth day of the eighth month of Shōhō 2, through the official envoys Sakai Sanuki-no-kami Tadakatsu and Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobutsuna, there was an imperial command that the heir Lord Inuchiyo should succeed to Sanshū (Kaga) and that Lord Bimyō (Toshitsune) should serve as regent. On the twenty-second day of the eighth month, he went to the castle and had an audience as heir in the inner palace. The tribute gifts were: one tachi sword "Hisanobu," ten pieces of gold for saddle horse expenses, one thousand pieces of silver, fifty sets of seasonal clothing, and one thousand bundles of silk cotton. According to "Honpō Jikō": Lord Yōkō (Mitsutaka) served for seven years, but did he not receive a fief certificate from the shogunate? There is no copy of it. Lord Inuchiyo's succession also did not receive a certificate. Perhaps because the number of fiefs granted in Kan'ei 11 did not match the current succession assessment, it was deferred and not granted.

1. According to "Honpō Jojikō": Around Shōhō 3, the copy of the register of fief assessments for the three provinces of Ka-Etsu-Nō submitted to the shogunate is as follows:
864,559 koku 9 tō - Lord Matsudaira Inuchiyo's domain
127,566 koku 9 tō - Lord Matsudaira Awaji-no-kami's domain  
75,650 koku 9 tō - Lord Matsudaira Hida-no-kami's domain
258,984 koku 3 tō 1 shō - Lord Matsudaira Hizen-no-kami's domain
13,573 koku 3 tō 3 shō - Lord Hijikata Kawachi-no-kami's domain
Total: 1,340,335 koku 3 tō 4 shō

1. Around the same year, when the koku amounts recorded as exempt places on the map of the three provinces submitted to the shogunate are now calculated together, they are as follows:
Over 803,400 koku - Lord Matsudaira Inuchiyo's domain

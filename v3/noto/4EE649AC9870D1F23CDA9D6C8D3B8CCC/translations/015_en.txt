...governed the administration of the central region.

1. According to the Oda War Chronicle: In Tensho 8 (1580), the subjugation of the northern provinces was determined. First, Echizen Province was entrusted to Sassa Kuranosuke Narimasa, and Noto Province was entrusted to Maeda Matazaemon Toshiie, with Sugaya Kuemon and Fukutomi Heizaemon added as assistants. Toshiie departed from Fuchu in Echizen Province and headed to Noto. The Noto warriors Nukui Bitchu-no-kami Kagetaka and the brothers Miyake Bingo-no-kami Nagamori had been in conflict with the local lord Cho Kuroshiro-zaemon Renryu for many years. Their power weakened, they made peace, surrendered Noto, and joined the side of the Minister's house (Oda family). Therefore, they were now sent to serve under Toshiie and others.

1. According to the Cho Family Genealogy: In Tensho 8, when enemy forces under Nukui Shimotsuke barricaded themselves in Anamizu Castle, Renryu rushed forth and captured it. Nukui Bizen, Miyake Bingo, and others had suffered repeated defeats in recent years and, fearing Renryu's military prowess, entered into peace negotiations. Miyake Nagamori secretly went to Azuchi in Omi Province, offered Nanao Castle, repented his former wrongs, surrendered, and requested pardoning. Lord Nobunaga showed clemency and sent Tokuyama Gohei Noritaka as an inspector of Noto Province, conveying strict orders that old grudges should not be harbored and that they should await further commands. Accordingly, Renryu sent his retainer Cho Iki as an envoy to Azuchi. He reported that while Nukui and Miyake had used deceitful words to atone for their accumulated evil and temporarily received leniency, they remained the principal enemies in the province, and he wished to quickly carry out strict punishment to achieve his true intentions. Lord Nobunaga was pleased with his repeated military achievements and on the first day of the ninth month of the same year granted him half of Kashima District in Noto Province. The vermillion seal document is preserved in the family to this day. The text reads:

"Regarding landholding matters: As previously promised to those who were loyal to Nanao, you shall govern half of Kashima District. We will later assign you additional lands, so this arrangement is appropriate for now. Since Nanao's envoy is here, we have conveyed this message as stated above. It is most appropriate that your residence castle be at Fukumitsu. Sugaya Kuemon will provide further details.

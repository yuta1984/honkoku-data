Muramatsu later became an abandoned village, and this village name no longer exists today.

One item: In the intercalary 3rd month of Keichō 4th year, the domain founder Lord Toshiie passed away. The retirement territories of Ishikawa and Kahoku districts in Kaga Province, along with Himi District in Etchū Province, were transferred to the heir Lord Toshinaga, while Noto Province's single district of 15,000 koku was transferred to the second son Lord Toshimasa. However, copies of these transfer documents are not found in various records.

　The text of the domain founder's final instructions is as follows:

One item: Regarding our retirement fief holdings: Ishikawa District, Kahoku District, and Himi District shall be presented to Lord Hizen-no-kami (Toshinaga). The single district in Nōshū (Noto) of 15,000 koku shall be given to Magoshirō (Toshimasa).

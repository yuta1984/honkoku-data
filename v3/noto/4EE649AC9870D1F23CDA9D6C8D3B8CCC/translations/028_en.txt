Intercalary 8th month, 11th day　　　　Terashima Jinnosuke
　　　　Kokutai-ji Temple　　　　　　　　　　signature and seal
　　　　　　Attendant Zen Master
　The above was transmitted by Kokutai-ji Temple in Nishida, Imizu District
　One, according to the "Sanshū-shi Kokyokō" (Historical Survey of Ancient Sites in Three Provinces): The castle lord of Moriyama in Imizu District, Etchu Province was
　　Jinbo Aki-no-kami Ujiharu. In Tensho 13, Sassa Narimasa suffered a great
　　defeat and surrendered, whereupon he relinquished the three districts of Tonami, Imizu, and Nei within his domain,
　　and Toyotai-ko [Hideyoshi] granted them to the Maeda family. The domain founder appointed Okajima Bitchu-no-kami Morimori,
　　and in the 9th month of the same year, the heir Toshikatsu moved and took residence there from Mattō in Kaga Province.
　　Heiji's note: The above regulatory notices from Kokufu and letters from Kokutai-ji Temple and others
　　are recorded here as evidence for the granting of the three districts in the intercalary 8th month.


　One, also now among former domain retainers, those who received family
　　stipends and fief land seal documents from the founding of the domain, each descendant has transmitted them as family
　　treasures. The seal document transmitted by the Teranishi family is as follows:
　　From within the granted portion of Etchu Province, six hundred hyō are
　　commanded to be supported. There shall fully be knowledge and governance as stated herein.

　　　　　　　　　Lord Teranishi Hanemon
　According to the above seal document, on the 11th day of the 9th month of Tensho 13, heir Magoshiro
　Toshikatsu-kun had already received the three districts of Etchu, which appears earlier as confirmation of the territory,
　and should be combined with the text of Hideyoshi-ko's personally written seal document of the 21st day of the 9th month

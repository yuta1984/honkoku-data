to Kanazawa," etc. The author's note states: "According to a different account, it was 80,000 koku, not 20,000 koku. This is the actual truth."

Heiji's analysis: The aforementioned traditions vary considerably and are not uniform, and their chronologies also differ greatly. An old established document with Lord Toshimitsu's seal dated the 3rd day of the 9th month of Keicho 16, being regulations for mansion magistrates, is recorded below:

1. Regarding the matter of replacement land for lower residences within the household that were distributed to the Takaoka retainers this time
These should be managed in addition to the previous residential arrangements, etc.

Document addressed to mansion magistrates including Yokoyama Yamashiro-no-kami on the 4th day of the 9th month of the same year:
"Regarding the matter of the Takaoka retainers' residences, since the reasoning has been presented, it is ordered that this original document should be delivered for this occasion," etc.

Based on the above sealed documents and others, the retirement-support retainers were returned to Kanazawa in Keicho 16, but had they already been returned twice before that time? The "Kanazawa Detailed Map Genealogy" lists Keicho 10 and Keicho 16 as two occasions, but this is probably an error. Keicho 10 was the year when Lord Toshinaga retired.

1. Copy of Certificate from Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu
Regarding the three provinces of Kaga, Etchu, and Noto
These have been granted in their entirety. Guard this decree and demonstrate loyal service. Thus it is declared.
　　16th day, 9th month, Keicho 19　[Seal]
　　　To the Kaga Chamberlain

This copy, recorded in various old domain records, was made as Ieyasu's sealed document, and even now at Matsu-

To Lord Matsudaira Chikuzen-no-kami

The aforementioned messengers, Honda Kozuke-no-suke and Doi Oi-no-suke, carried out this task, and it was declared that they should depart for Edo early the next morning. Oi-no-suke departed for Edo.

1. The "Sanshū-shi" (Records of Three Provinces) states: In the 9th month, our lord paid respects at Sunpu and there was a ceremony of audience. This was because he had been granted the hereditary fief of the previous lord for his retirement. The Divine Lord (Ieyasu) bestowed a certificate of official permission for the perpetual enfeoffment of the three provinces of Ka-Etsu-Nō. This was delivered from Sunpu to Edo, and on the 23rd of the same month, he went to the castle and had an audience ceremony. The Taitoku administration also bestowed a certificate of official permission for the perpetual enfeoffment of the three provinces and transferred his appointment to Sashōshō (Minor Captain of the Left).

The author's note states: Both copies of the aforementioned certificates of official permission for perpetual enfeoffment became nothing when the original documents were lost in the fire at the Edo residence in the 3rd month of Keian 3. This is regrettable.

1. Upon examination, the fire at the Edo residence occurred on the 19th day of the 4th month. Stating it as the 3rd month is probably an error. The shogunate's notification document from the 4th month of Kanbun 3 is recorded as follows. Perhaps the author's note in "Sanshū-shi" was mistaken based on this.

1. Hizen-no-kami received the red seals of the three generations: Gongen-sama, Taitoku-in-sama, and Daikōin-sama. However, in the 3rd month of the year of the Tiger, Keian 3, when the Hongō residence was caught in a spreading fire, they were lost. Copies exist.
　The aforementioned fire is recorded in "Kanka Kenbun-shū" as follows:
　At the hour of the horse on the 19th day of the 4th month of Keian 3, the year of the Metal Tiger, at Edo Hongō

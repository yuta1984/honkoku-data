1. According to the origin records of Seikibo and Henshojo written in Jokyo 2 (1685): The founding year of our temple, Gokokuyama Sugawara-ji, and other details are unclear. According to ancient oral traditions, there were 36 temple halls that enshrined the spirit of Kitano, but they were burned down during the Sengoku period conflicts. The chief priests of both halls rebuilt the shrine halls and temple buildings through divine assistance. When Lord Toshiie came down to Noto Province, he took his seat at Sugawara-ji, and since Tenjin was his clan deity, he commanded that prayers should be offered before the shrine during his stay at this place. He departed for Nanao, and during his military encampment there, he ordered considerations of annual divination and auspicious days for good fortune. When I duly considered and reported this, I received sealed documents granting 25 koku to Tenjin Shrine and 20 koku to both head priests. A disciple of Henshojo, a young monk of twelve or thirteen years, composed this hokku from a divine vision: "Guard well, O country, how pure is the moonlight."

The farmers of Michishita have fled and are scattered in various places. Therefore, the village headmen and administrators should be summoned immediately. Any places that raise objections should be dealt with strictly.

Since there are bandits in that vicinity, you should use your discretion there, and consider it a crime to hide farmers who should be brought out as those who cannot be taken.

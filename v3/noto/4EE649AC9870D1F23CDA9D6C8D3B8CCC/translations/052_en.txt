They arrived at the capital and immediately reported to the shogun. These three men were summoned before him in the evening, and he declared: "It has been ordered that the three provinces be granted to Chikuzen-no-kami Toshimitsu. Since Toshimitsu is still young, each of you shall serve as his guardian, as has been commanded. You are relied upon for this." Moved by these kind words, the three men shed tears of gratitude, withdrew, and each presented fifty rolls of Kaga silk. They also offered as relics of Hizen-no-kami a Fudo Masamune wakizashi and a Bizen Saburo sword. Honda Kozuke-no-suke made the presentation.

The "Ressentei Seiseki" also states: "On the 13th day of the 7th month of this year, Maeda Toshimitsu's retainers - Maeda Tsushima-no-kami, Nagahara Saemon-no-jo, Okumura Settsu-no-kami, and Honda Awa-no-kami Masamune - arrived in Sunpu and presented two famous swords that were Toshiie's relics. Therefore, they requested that Toshimitsu be granted Toshiie's retirement domain of 160,000 koku in Noto. The Divine Ancestor summoned the four men and, as requested, allowed Toshimitsu to rule the domain, granted 30,000 koku to Toshimitsu's wife (the Divine Ancestor's granddaughter), and admonished them, saying: 'Since Toshimitsu is young, you must all be loyal and guide him well.' The four men were moved and withdrew."

Upon examination, the "Butoku Taisei-ki" records the same. Perhaps the 160,000 koku in Noto Province as Toshiie's retirement domain was actually a misheard reference to Niikawa District in Etchu Province.

Arisawa Takesada's "Kohei-dan" notes in red ink state: "Of Lord Toshiie's retirement domain of 220,000 koku, 60,000 koku were returned to Kanazawa in Keicho 16, making it 160,000 koku. Later, another 100,000 koku were returned to Kanazawa, making it 60,000 koku. However, in the spring of Keicho 19, another 50,000 koku were returned, so at the time of his death, only about 10,000 koku remained as retirement stipend."

Heiji notes that the above account is probably based on false rumors, as can be understood from the following personal letters: "Regarding the matter that troubles me... Since I have been troubling you with such lengthy matters, I have had Chikuzen-no-kami take charge of a few men capable of serving as construction supervisors for the retirement domain and had them move to Kanazawa. As for myself, I am currently managing my own personnel..."

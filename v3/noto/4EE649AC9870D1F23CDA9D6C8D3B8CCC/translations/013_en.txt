1. Upon examination, the sealed document addressed to the Fujikake Village officials is from Tensho 7. This is because Lord Toshiie's entry into the domain was in October of Tensho 6. Therefore, one theory relates it to Tensho 6, the year of Boshin. Presumably, the vermillion seal document dated October 2nd granted by Lord Nobunaga contains only the month and day but no era name, so definitive proof cannot be obtained.

1. According to the Records of Kanazawa Hoen-ji: The founding abbot of our temple, Great Master Daitō Keijo, was a tenth-generation dharma descendant of Sōji-ji's Keizan Zenji. He first served as head priest at Hoen-ji in Takase, Echizen Province, being the seventh generation there. In the autumn of the eighth month of Tensho 1, year of Mizunoto-tori (1573), when Lord Toshiie was at the castle of Fuchū in Echizen, he took refuge with Great Master Daitō of Takase Hoen-ji. In Tensho 6, year of Tsuchinoe-tora, when Lord Toshiie was at Nanao Castle in Noto Province, he established a Zen temple here, named it Hoen, and respectfully invited Great Master Daitō to be the founding patriarch. In Tensho 11, year of Mizunoto-hitsuji, when Lord Toshiie built his castle compound in Kanazawa, Kaga Province, he reconstructed Hoen Zen Temple at the southeast edge of the castle and again invited Great Master Daitō from Nanao in Noto to serve as head priest. In Bunroku 3, year of Kinoe-uma (1594), Great Master Daitō invited Master Zōzan to become the second generation and retired to the old temple in Noto Province, renaming Noto's Hoen as Chōrei-ji.

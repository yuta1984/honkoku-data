Toyotomi Hideugu's residual mansion was granted by the Toyotomi lord to our domain founder, and [the founder] was entrusted with the protection of Lord Hideyori.

During the Bunroku years when Taikō dispatched troops for the Korean campaign, the head priest was to serve as a laborer for the Korean campaign, so he traveled to Fushimi and through Kō-zōsu made a petition. Regarding the previous precedent of donating lamp-lighting fields, there was notification from Kō-zōsu. Therefore, Bun-

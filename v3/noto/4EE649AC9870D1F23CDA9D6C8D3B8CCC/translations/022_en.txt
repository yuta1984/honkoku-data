1. Upon examination, the old manuscript from Lord Shoun's time states: "Regarding the matter of the three districts of Etchu, concerning the request for official documents in Magoichiro's name, this too shall be entirely according to your wishes." The meaning differs greatly from the previous version.

Copy of Toyotaiko's (Hideyoshi's) vermillion seal document recorded in Sekiya Masaharu's "Old Military Tales":
On the 25th, we returned to camp at Kameyama. Everyone has endured hardships during this time. Regarding the current campaign, we positioned horses at Kurikara Pass in Etchu, and our advance forces set fires eastward to the foothills of Mount Tate, Obatake, and Mount Tsurugi. As a result, Kifune, Moriyama, Masuyama, and other locations suffered defeats. Consequently, Naizo-no-suke (Sassa Narimasa) surrendered, relying on Nobuo's mediation, surrendered his residence at Toyama, and fled to our camp, whereupon we granted him clemency for his life. We are now considering whether he should move to Toyama Castle today, and have advanced as far as Seriya-no. Since Toyama Echigo Nagao is to serve, he should be received at that location. Given these circumstances, there is no need for swords or blades, so you may be at ease. We shall remain encamped for another few days, arrange the appointments of castle lords throughout the province, and promptly conclude the campaign. Then we shall return to our side as reported. Since troops are no longer needed quickly, they are unnecessary. You should certainly understand this intention.

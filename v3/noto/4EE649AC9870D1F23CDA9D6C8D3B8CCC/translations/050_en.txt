[Continuing from previous page] used the land of Noto as a base, citing it as an obstruction to the hunting grounds. This is recorded in the old domain's land records, and the Sanshū-shi dates it as the 13th year. According to Heiji's research, the Nōshū Shiogama tax collection office's fixed record contained in the Onko Iroku states as follows:

1,341 kan 720 mon - Shiogama remaining balance
    31 kan 320 mon - Sora village - Hijikata portion  
    30 kan 220 mon - Kanami village - same
    16 kan 700 mon - Maiki village - same
    Total: 78 kan 240 mon
From Keichō 10th year, transferred to Lord Hijikata

This fixed record is indeed a document from the Keichō years. Based on this, the allocation was not related to Keichō 11th or 13th year.

One: On the 28th day of the 6th month of Keichō 10th year (1605), Lord Toshinaga retired and transferred the two provinces of Kaga and Noto, along with the three counties of Tonami, Imizu, and Nei in Etchū to his heir. Niikawa county was made into a retirement domain, and after residing at Toyama castle, he made Takaoka his residence castle. Copies of the official documents from this time are not found in various records.

The Sanshū-shi states: "Examining the genealogy, it was the 28th day of the 6th month of Keichō 11th year," but the Butoku Taisei-ki states it was the 6th year, and classical texts state it was the 9th year - none of these are correct. The Kan'ei 18th year genealogical record states: "Keichō 10th year, 6th month, 28th day - succeeded as head of family." Arisawa Takesada said that Lord Toshimitsu was residing at Komatsu around this time. One document states "moved from Kanazawa castle in Keichō 10th year." Another theory says he moved in the 8th year. Various theories do not agree.

　　　　　　　　Hirokawa　Village farmers

　The above two documents are in the possession of Imazu Jinemon

First, according to the testimony document of Imazu Jinemon:
　When Taikō-sama granted the fiefs of Imazu and Hirokawa villages to Lord Hōshun-in, my ancestor Kawarabayashi Jinemon was appointed as deputy administrator (daikan) and was granted 10 koku of rice annually from Keichō 7. However, when Lord Hōshun-in passed away in Genna 3, it was unclear whether the fief of both villages should be returned to the government (kōgi) or be delivered to our lord, so Jinemon stored the fief rice from both villages for three years. When Lord Tokushō-in expressed his intentions, we sought his private counsel and went to Edo to report to the magistrate's office, whereupon it became our lord's fief. At that time, the formal document handed down by Lord Awa-no-kami and Lord Yamashiro-no-kami is copied as follows. At that time he was called Jinroku.

Since that territory suffered flooding this year, the farmers became impoverished and came down [seeking help], but since this matter cannot be resolved in this place, they should return home first.

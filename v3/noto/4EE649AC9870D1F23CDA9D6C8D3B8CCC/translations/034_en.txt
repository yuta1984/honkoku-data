First, upon examination, the copies recorded in the old domain genealogical records are dated either the 6th day of the 3rd month of Bunroku 4, or the 6th day of the 3rd month of Bunroku 2. In the 6th month of Kōka 3, I found a copy of the aforementioned vermillion seal document among the old documents belonging to Chikaokaya Yaemon, a townsman from an old family in Kanazawa whose house had burned down, dated as the 6th day of the 3rd month of Bunroku 4. Examining this copy based on the paper quality and calligraphy style, it appears to be a transcription from about two hundred years ago, probably a copy made when the original document still existed. Also, since the Imazu tradition holds it to be Bunroku 2, perhaps the copy of the certificate also makes it year 2. According to the Kugyō Bunin, Toshiie was appointed to Gon-Chūnagon on the 1st day of the 4th month of Bunroku 3; around the 3rd month of year 2, he held the ranks of Sangi and Chūjō.

The above was clearly granted for lodging during travel between Kanazawa and the capital region for sankin attendance, as is evident from the wording of the vermillion seal document. However, in Keichō 3, when the domain founder made his retirement and transfer of the domain, the intent of his petition was...

...was it so? It was granted by Taikō as kesho-den (makeup rice fields) to the young lord of domain founder Lord Toshiie. When the young lord died in Genna 3, it was returned to the shogunate the following year (4), but in the same 6th year, it was granted anew to the Maeda house.

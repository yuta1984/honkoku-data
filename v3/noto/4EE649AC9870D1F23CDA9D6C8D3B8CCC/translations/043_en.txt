　　2nd month, 4th day　Chikusen　[seal]
　　　　To Lord Magoshirō

The above is a personal letter from Lord Toshiie, likely from the 2nd month of Keichō 4th year. This is recorded as reference material for the Noto domain allocation.

One item: Upon examination, the "Resuso Seishoku" states: "In the 4th month of Keichō 3rd year, Toshiie's eldest son Toshikatsu was appointed to the rank of Junior Third Rank, Provisional Middle Counselor." The annotation states: "Upon examination, Toshikatsu's younger brother Magoshirō was elevated to Junior Fourth Rank Lower Grade and made Chamberlain. This was probably at this time, but since there is no clear documentation, it is not recorded. Toshikatsu was the former name of Lord Toshinaga. On the 10th day of the 4th month of this year, the domain founder abdicated and the heir succeeded to the fief. This court rank and appointment was due to Lord Toshimasa's allocation of Noto."

One item: Also regarding the Noto domain territory, copying a sealed document granting stipend land to retainers:
　　As an increase and for household expenses, four hundred hyō are hereby granted as stipend. This shall be entirely treated as fief land. As per this document.

1. This copy was transcribed from an old manuscript by Lord Shoun (Matsudaira). It is likely a copy of the original document. Copies contained in various records of the former domain have substantially similar wording. The essential text is as follows:

Written in my own hand. In recent years, Naizo-no-suke (Sassa Narimasa) has repeatedly sent troops to the border, and when he had nearly captured Suemori Castle, you and your son immediately launched a rear attack, achieving great advantage. Afterwards, you sent troops into Etchu Hasunuma, conducted burning attacks, and defeated the enemy, earning great merit that was heard even in the capital, which pleases me greatly. Narimasa is from Hida and often acts inappropriately. Though he intended to achieve dominance over this region, given his various dependencies on the main castle (Osaka Castle) and now that he has become a monk, he seeks assistance in his current fallen state.

I grant you Niikawa District. The remaining three districts shall be given to you. However, since you have repeatedly exerted yourself and captured territory through your spear work, you may feel somewhat unsatisfied, and I understand your dissatisfaction. I also consider this a reward from my side. As a token of my constant gratitude, I shall send you fine horses as well. Henceforth, instead of Maeda Matazaemon, you shall be called Hashiba Chikuzen-no-kami. Naturally, Magoichiro shall also be called Hashiba. I have heard of your repeated achievements as well. Therefore, though I prepare official documents for the three districts of Etchu, if there are any particular requests, they shall be granted according to your wishes. (Abbreviated below)

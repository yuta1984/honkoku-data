1. Within the territory of Akamaru Village, there is a Shingon sect temple called Kuramadera. In the past, it had seven sub-temples, and its mountain name was called Kawahitoyama. Long ago, the founding of Kawahito Gongen Shrine occurred when Prince Genshō Tennō's Second Prince was residing at Asai Castle in the same village territory. At that time, the Oyabe River flowed along the cliff of the castle mountain, and a divine body of the gongen deity was found floating at a place called Akoga Pool. A hunter retrieved it and reported to the Prince. In Yōrō 1 (717), seven-hall temple complex was built, imitating the capital with the construction of Kiyomizu, Kamo, Sannō, and Hachiman shrines, and additionally seven sub-temples were established. When the Prince visited for worship, the seven sub-temples offered sake, and when the Prince lifted his cup, two centipedes fell from the ceiling into the cup. Thinking this was Bishamonten, he designated the temple name as Kuramadera and the mountain name as Kawahitoyama. Until that time, the district was called Yoshioka-no-shō, but the Prince renamed it Goi-no-shō. Later, the temple complex was destroyed by war fires. Even now, the sites of the seven halls and shrine buildings remain, where grass shrines have been built, and religious ceremonies are conducted with fifty-three villages as supporters. The Three Shrine Gongen is located within the territories of Akamaru Village and Ishizutsumi Village. They had received documents with the Prince's light ink seal, but these were burned in the fire. Among the seven sub-temples, one called Higashi-no-bō remains, and its descendant, a mountain ascetic called Saihōin, still serves as the head priest of this Kuramadera shrine.

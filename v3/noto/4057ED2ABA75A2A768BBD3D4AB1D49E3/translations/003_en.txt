1. [Location: Matsunaga Village] Within the territory of Dōrinji Village and Chō Village, there is a castle ruin called "Genji-ga-mine" (Minamoto Peak). It is said that when a Heike general took refuge in this castle, Minamoto no Yoshinaka (Kiso Yoshinaka) attacked it and the castle fell. It is now a brushwood mountain.

1. Within the territory of Nabata Village, there is a place called "Koya-ga-yauchi" (Hut Valley), which is said to be the site of Sasa Kuranosuke's military camp, and it is still called Koya-ga-yauchi today.

1. Within the territory of Usuya Village, there is a mountain called "Oshirahi-yama," with a forest on its peak. This place is revered as a gongen (avatar of Buddha). It is said that women are forbidden to climb this mountain, so local women still do not climb it today. At the base of this mountain, there are stone arrangements that appear to be temple ruins, but they are now fields and meadows.

1. In a place called "Tateishi" (Standing Stone) within the territory of Matsuo Village, there is a large stone approximately twenty jō (about 60 meters) in height.

According to analysis, the island mentioned in the poems composed by Otomo no Yakamochi, Governor of Etchu Province, in Manyoshu Volume 18 on May 14th of the first year of Tempyo-kanpo era (749 CE), wishing for pearls as gifts for his family in the capital - with verses about "abalone pearls that the fishermen of Suzu dive to collect at Okitsu-mikami" and "going and crossing to Okitsu Island" - is clearly what is now called Hegura Island. Since Okitsu-hime Shrine, listed in the Engishiki Shinmeicho (register of shrines), is enshrined on this island, it may have been called so after the shrine name, or conversely, the island name may have led to this designation for the shrine.

Further analysis of the Konjaku Monogatari tells of seven men from Kaga Province who went to sea for fishing and reached an island called Neko Island (Cat Island), where they first settled following the teachings of the island's deity, and their descendants prospered. This island was called Neko Island, located in the depths of Noto Province, with an island called Oni no Neya Island (Demon's Sleeping Place Island) far offshore from a place called Mitsu-ura, and even further out in the ocean was the island called Neko Island. Since this island is described as producing many abalones, it is clear that Neko Island is another name for Hegura Island. If so, Oni no Neya Island would be what is now called Nanatsu Island.

According to old accounts, Hegura Island was once inhabited, but in medieval times human habitation was severed due to rough seas and it became uninhabited. Fishermen from Kanegasaki in Chikuzen began crossing annually to stay on this island, making their livelihood by harvesting abalones and other marine products. Eventually they settled permanently in this province, residing in Wajima during winter and on the island during fishing season. This migration began during the Kanbun era (1661-1673), marking the founding of Wajima's Ama-machi (Fishermen's Town). Another theory places this in the Tensho era (1573-1593). Nanatsu Island is also said to have originally been one island that was broken up by rough seas, leaving only pillar-like rock formations.

Based on these traditions, it becomes increasingly clear that Nanatsu Island is indeed the ancient Oni no Neya Island.

Morita Yoshimi analyzed this and recorded it here.

Hegura Island (old name: Okitsu Island), Nafune Village territory, Kawarada Group, Hoshi District
Map (two bu of curved ruler equals ten ken)

Height: 7-8 ken, Length: approximately 900 ken
Width: over 350 ken, Circumference: over 1 ri

Fishermen began crossing to Hegura Island during the Kanbun era, and thereafter until the An'ei era they crossed from Nafune to conduct fishing operations.

In February of Kaei 4 (1851), this was copied from a secret map by Ogura Aritoshi. This is a recent survey map, drawn by Takagi Touzaemon Nobuyoshi (Ishiguro Nobuyoshi) under national command. Recorded by Morita Yoshimi of Ryuen-sha.

In September of Meiji 32 (1899), the Hokkoku Newspaper published an article on fisheries research of Hegura Island. Since it provides sufficient detail on the island's actual conditions and marine products, it has been excerpted and attached to the back of this map for reference.

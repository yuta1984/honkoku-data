was appointed. Yusa was to reside with the Ikeda faction, and the two would govern Noto together. The following year, on the 19th day of the 3rd month of Tenshō 6 (1578), Kaneshin died of illness. After that, it came under Nobunaga's control, and Sugaya Kuemon was dispatched to order Yusa to commit seppuku. Lord Chō was granted the premier vermillion seal document for the four districts of Noto. Jōan received this and first departed from Azuchi. From Irachōraku, he took a boat across the water sea and went up to Kaizu. He went out to Tsuruga, again took a boat, went up to Ōtani in this province, and was planning to enter Anamizu. However, when the Nanao forces came out and would not permit entry, he went as far as Nanao and entered Hōtōji temple. Then, from the main castle, as part of a stratagem, they sent an envoy saying he should come out for a feast. Jōan replied that it was too presumptuous. Sensing there were reasons for concern regarding the envoy, that night he withdrew to Furuni village. He passed through Masugata from Chino Hatta, and around dawn arrived at Tōrinji temple on Mt. Sekidō, but since the head priest was away, he entered Amidain temple in Yakebidani. Local people including Ishiguro Daizen, Miyakawa Seiemon, and Iwama Sōjo accompanied him, along with many others. With guidance from Amidain, he traveled through Etchū district for forty-eight ri, going out to Kano beach as far as Kido-kaku. He entered an empty castle belonging to a man named Kutsure Saburōzaemon in Nanchō village within the district, and it was said that he consulted with Uchiharu and requested his assessment.

After that, he entered Fukumizu castle. These retainers joined under his banner and were planning to enter Tazuruhama when the Nanao forces, using Tokumaru castle in Noto district as their base and understanding Higashi Baba Kubotakamaru as an attached castle, took position along the Nagasawa River and drew up in field formation. Under these circumstances, Suzuki Inaba, thinking there might be cause for concern, said that if the lord went up to Kameyama in this manner and, upon observing the situation, deemed it an appropriate time, he would blow the signal conch. The vanguard was sent out. Without deviation, following orders, the signal conch was blown at Sone village beach, so Lord Chō's forces advanced to the Nagasawa River. The lead attacker was a man named Okabe Naheе. When a man named Kataoka Shinhachiō from Lord Nukui's retinue came out as a fierce warrior on two paths, Ikegami Jinsuke engaged him in close combat, took Shinhachiō's head, and achieved merit. Hearing this, the Nanao forces, thinking there was no hope, all withdrew to Echigo. Lord Chō triumphantly entered Tazuruhama. This...

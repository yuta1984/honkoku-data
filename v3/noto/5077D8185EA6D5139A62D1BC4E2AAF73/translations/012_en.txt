A warrior on pilgrimage named Shinano Kurando became suspect. When Kurando heard this, he said "It cannot be helped. What fortune, for the person who speaks of this matter," and if he were to be determined a thief, he would undergo trial by ordeal (tetsuka - divine judgment by hot iron). He posted notices in various places, and at Shinmei shrine in Kanazawa, saying that if he were innocent he would take the hot iron, and though he had never braided rope before, he would follow the law and braided rope. Then he used purification water and showed his hands to the spectators. Afterward he said: "For a samurai to bear such false accusation is a sign that divine punishment has reached its limit. I shall commit seppuku." He had previously asked Inoue Kanzaemon to act as his second, and committed seppuku on the spot.

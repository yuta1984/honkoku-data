Tajima was the younger brother of Hijikata Kanbei-dono. Takeda Miyauchi was also a younger brother of Hijikata and elder brother of Tajima. Miyauchi became a masterless samurai following Tajima's younger brother, then entered service with Ikeda Miyauchi-shō-dono and received a fief of 3,000 koku. He changed his name to Hijikata Bitchū-no-kami. Later, when he heard rumors spread by a colleague named Sassa Kanbei about Bitchū's son, he encountered [Sassa] at the castle gate on one occasion, fought a duel, killed Kanbei, and then committed seppuku.

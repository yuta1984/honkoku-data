They took to the mountains and after about a day, the aforementioned provincial samurai surrounded them to attack. Higo-no-kami's eldest son Kenbutsu, who was about thirty years old at the time, said: "The attacking enemies are provincial samurai who are our daily acquaintances. Therefore, even if we kill fifty or thirty of them, there would be no benefit. It would be better to commit seppuku." He sent their weapons to the enemy side, and father and son both committed seppuku. Ajisaka Bitchū still endured and remained in the main citadel, but the provincial samurai, considering their daily relationship, made arrangements and gave him one-tenth of his former holdings, bringing him down to the foot of the mountain. Taking over the main citadel, they governed the province for about three years. After that, Lord Nobunaga sent four men into Nōshū with Sugaya Kuemon as general: Maeda Matazaemon, Shibuya Oki-no-kami, and Fuwa Hikosaburo. Sugaya Kuemon declared this to be Lord Nobunaga's intention and ordered the provincial samurai to kill seven men: Yusa Mimasaku-no-kami, his younger brother Itami, retainers of Yusa Nagato-no-kami of the same name - four retainers in total - and sent their heads to Azuchi. After that, the province was completely pacified, so Lord Nobunaga granted the province of Noto to Lord Maeda Matazaemon. However, Kashima half-district was granted to Chō Kurōzaemon, who served as a supporter to Lord Matazaemon. The provincial samurai were expelled from Noto province and fled to Echigo. However, since Kenshin's adopted son Kihēji Kagekasu had survived and reported that the provincial samurai had betrayed Ajisaka Bitchū, it became difficult for them to remain even in Echigo, so they relied on the monk-soldiers of Ishidō-yama in Nōshū. The monk-soldiers readily allied with them. Around this time, Lord Shingen was killed by Akechi, so the provincial samurai used this as justification and moved from Echigo to Ishidō-yama on the last day of the sixth month of the same year. On the early morning of the twenty-fifth day of the seventh month, intending to build a fortress on Arayama, which was connected to Ishidō-yama, all the generals went out together with the Ishidō monk-soldiers. At that point, Sakuma Genba-no-kami, leading forces from Kaga and Echizen as reinforcement for Matazaemon, was attempting to approach Ishidō via the Arayama pass, when they encountered the provincial samurai who had come out to prepare the fortress, and they fought. Among them, the Ishidō monk-soldier Hannya-in (originally the son of a man called Bushin, a retainer of Yusa Mimasaku-no-kami) wielded a naginata and cut down enemies in all directions, wounding and killing thirty men. Other generals including Sukui Bitchū, his younger brother Miyake Bingo, Onui Yamashiro, and his younger brothers followed suit, and four to five hundred other retainers died in battle. Heino Kaga-no-kami and Miyake Kosaburo, uncle and nephew, were separated by the enemy and remained at Ishidō.

was given. In addition, the Sambayashi side gave me a ceremonial short sword as a war trophy. In this engagement, both Hori Saisuke and Inoue Kanzaemon were killed in action. One more person, Kawauchiyama Jirōzaemon, is still alive.

○During the battle of Kurotani in Enuma District, when the enemy general Shibata Sanzaemon attacked, I went out and was the first to cross spears, sustaining painful wounds before retreating. Ikeda Yazaemon knows of this.

○During the battle of Ishizaka in the same district, when Lord Shibata's forces attacked, I also went out to fight, and when I fought at Ishizaka front, I was also wounded and retreated.

When Suketayū was about to be quickly overpowered, my retainer ran up and stopped the fleeing man. At that time, my retainer was eighteen years old. As a reward for this, Lord Tamba gave him a short sword and one kosode robe. Lord Fuwa Genroku knows of this. Among the elders of Miyakoshi town, there should still be some alive today who remember this. Although I feel it is presumptuous to speak of such matters at length, since my wife and children have now fallen into such dire poverty that I find their situation pitiful, I have written thus.

The revival of the Tang dynasty was through Han Yu's brush
The military achievements in Huaixi are called unparalleled  
The sage emperor's divine decision was truly godlike in military prowess
Having succeeded in suppressing the rebels, he did not kill those who surrendered

Having retainers who yet do not die, I beseech you not to trouble Your Majesty's heart
At that time, you too were merely a common man, yet able to speak such words - how heroic your resolve!
Indeed, with brilliant strategy achieving miraculous victories, single-handedly turning the tide to establish the great enterprise

Only your unwavering loyalty to the country throughout establishes forever the model for all retainers

regretting this, Makino Kazutaka consulted with Miki and Miyata and revised it into five volumes written in mixed Chinese-Japanese script, further supplementing Mitsukuni's good words and virtuous deeds. Later, in Tenmei 6 (1786), the domain Confucian scholar Gohara Suiken collected materials that had been omitted from the previous work and created three volumes, each with detailed source citations (available in part in the "Records of Great Men's Words and Deeds" in the History Department of Toyohashi Municipal Library). Suiken (given name Man, commonly called Jingorō) was a renowned director of Shōkōkan at one time, possessing remarkable insights into statecraft. At the beginning of the Kansei era, when his domain lord Harunori recommended Matsudaira Sadanobu as assistant to Shogun Ienari and dispatched Kimura Kenji to Ezo (Hokkaido) to investigate the state of Russian intrusion, all this is said to have been based on Suiken's counsel.

At his father Gentoku's command, the Elder lodged with a certain physician of Hikone domain and pursued medical studies, but this was not to his liking. He left and went to study classics and history under the Confucian scholar Ōoka Uchū (given name Kyō, courtesy name Shirei, literary name Shōdō) in the neighboring village of Sone. Uchū was a disciple of Kamei Shōyō and a scholar of solid learning. His younger brother Kan (courtesy name Shikuri, literary name Shōshū) had a bold character and traveled widely throughout the country, eventually dying as a traveler in the northern seas. The Elder studied diligently under Uchū together with Shōshū, making great progress in his studies. In what the Elder wrote in later years, there is the passage "My relationship with Shōshū in terms of duty combined teacher and friend," from which we can infer their affectionate relationship.

In Bunsei 9 (1826), when the Elder was thirteen, he accompanied his father to Kyoto, had an audience with Rai San'yō, and vowed to return again to receive instruction under him, but this was not fulfilled (San'yō was then forty-seven, the Elder fifteen). Soon after, on April 19 of Bunsei 11 (1828), his father Gentoku died, his mother frequently fell ill, his eldest sister Hamako took charge of household affairs, and the Elder received her protection along with his siblings.

In Tenpō 1 (1830), the great poet of the age, Yanagawa Seigan, having completed his travels through Kyushu with his wife Kōran, came to lodge at the house of Onoda Kansai in Hikone, and the Elder entered his school. The Elder was then seventeen, Seigan forty-four. Seigan had traveled various places with his wife for nearly eighteen years, and that year he left Hikone again to enter Edo, so the Elder, at about eighteen the following year, entrusted his mother and younger siblings to his eldest sister Hamako and

resolutely entered Edo alone to study under various masters (San'yō died that year). Among these, he received the most favor from Bitō Suichiku, followed by Yanagawa Seigan and Fujimori Kōan, and he also gained much from studying under the Hayashi Daigaku-no-kami. Suichiku (given name Sekitaka, courtesy name Kitai, alternative name Gennan, from Edo), Seigan (given name Mōi, courtesy name Kōzu, also styled Mushō, called Shinjūrō, also known as Amaya, Hyakuhō, and Rōryūan, from Sone village in Anpachi district, Mino province), Fujimori Kōan (given name Taiga, courtesy name Jun'pū, commonly called Kyōsuke, alternative name Tenzan, from Edo, Confucian scholar of Tsuchiura domain), Hayashi Daigaku-no-kami (given name Akira, Confucian retainer of the shogunate).

The Elder was in the capital with very limited study funds, sometimes serving as a student servant, sometimes doing copying work, lodging here and there, fully experiencing hardships. Seigan established the Gyokuike Ginsha poetry society at Ochanomizu in Kanda, his reputation soaring throughout the land. At that time it was said "for prose, San'yō; for poetry, Seigan." He also associated with loyalist patriots, and the Elder participated in this, conspicuously showing his talent. Meanwhile, he responded to invitations from hatamoto such as Matsudaira Tango-no-kami and Shirasu Kai-no-kami to lecture on classics and history, earning his livelihood. This was truly when the Elder was twenty-five or twenty-six, a literal prodigy. Seigan placed his greatest hopes in the Elder, encouraging and inspiring him. There is a poem:

"Literary fortune turns with the times, brilliant talents rise in succession. How could refined and skillful works ultimately be lacking? Without this unrestrained and magnanimous talent."

"Too weary to seek empty decoration, much less to seek mere technique. With one spirit resolute, gold and stone melt. For the peng's journey of ninety thousand li, I place my hopes in you. Do not grow old carving insects beneath your window."

In a passage from the postscript that Kimura Kōzan wrote for the Elder's "Northern Journey Remaining Manuscripts":

"Kozan was from a poor family of humble status. When he was a student, night fell while traveling. Though he wished to stay at an inn, he had no money. He entered a roadside Jizō hall and

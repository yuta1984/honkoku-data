Soon after, the Master fled to Bōshū to escape the cold, and subsequently fell ill and passed away. According to what Elder Jō said at the time, most of the correspondence from the Master's prime years had been thrown into the fire and completely swept away, leaving almost nothing to rely upon today. However, among what he had recorded in his daily notes, there were certainly things worth preserving. The precious nature of the secret manuscripts passed down in his family is not difficult to imagine. Our Toyohashi Educational Association, recognizing this, took upon itself the responsibility of publication and requested that I write a preface. I gladly record my thoughts in response.

Since ancient times, Mikawa has been positioned at the center of the Tōkai region and is rich in numerous historical facts. Particularly during the Meiji Restoration, there were many talented individuals who effectively advocated the great cause of imperial loyalty and did not err in their direction. Among the most renowned of these figures is Elder Ono Kozan. The Elder truly rose from humble origins in his youth to become a great Confucian scholar of his generation. He widely joined with patriots throughout the land, devoted himself to the restoration of imperial authority, contributed to local education and culture, and was a person of exceptional merit who achieved unity in the great cause among the domains of Owari and Mikawa.

Therefore, our Toyohashi City Educational Association now publishes a new biography of the Elder, introducing to the world his brilliant career that had not yet been widely known. This will benefit not only our local region but also contribute significantly to national moral education.

I humbly serve in the position of Toyohashi City Mayor and have had the fortune to encounter this endeavor, and I cannot contain my feelings of joy. I further hope that in the future this region will produce many more like Elder Kozan, who will be loyal and devoted to their sovereign and country. I offer these words as a preface.

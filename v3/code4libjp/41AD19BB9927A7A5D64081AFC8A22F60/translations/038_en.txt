[continuing from previous page] ...were all present, and this could be called a song of praise for the entire Restoration. The old man's intention in resigning from office was that since the work of the Restoration had already been accomplished and there was no shortage of talented men with the ability to maintain what had been achieved, it would be better to retire in transcendent detachment."

Though the old man had once returned home to express his filial devotion, as his mother's illness gradually improved, she would not allow him to remain long in the remote mountain village. When the system of domain registry return was proclaimed and in the second year of Meiji (1869) each domain lord was redesignated as a domain governor, it was decided that three councillors - senior, junior, and assistant - would be appointed from among the domain retainers to handle local governmental affairs, and the old man was also appointed as assistant junior councillor of Yoshida domain at the summons of domain lord Nobutō.

Indeed, having been appointed as assistant administrator of the new Meiji government yet leaving that position without regret, and then taking up the post of assistant junior councillor of a single domain - with ordinary thinking, this might invite criticism about appearances and such. But the old man, who had long paid deep attention to education in the domain and felt grateful for his lord's recognition, readily accepted and responded to this trust, hurrying back to the domain. He further supervised the academic affairs of the domain school Jishūkan, earnestly reformed the educational system, encouraged the literary and martial ways, newly established a dormitory system, and hoped to completely renew the aspect of education. Regrettably, before the project could get properly underway, the abolition of domains and establishment of prefectures was proclaimed in the fourth year (1871), and consequently Jishūkan also had to cease its operations. At this time, the Mikawa Court that had been established within Yoshida's Goshinin Temple was renamed Mikawa Prefecture, and under its supervision a imperial and Chinese studies school called Shūdōkan was opened in Kōfu town, Hoi district, with the old man appointed as its head. He personally took charge of the Chinese studies department and enlisted his friend Hatano Takao (later Sakaki), a Shinto priest from Hata village (now Hanada), to take charge of the imperial studies department, and together they devoted themselves to local education, but this too was discontinued after only a short time.

During the time when the old man was involved in the academic affairs of our Jishūkan throughout this period, there were quite a few talented students, and our domain's educational affairs flourished. Takao also built something called "Jūshū Gakusha" at his own residence at that time, and the old man supported this, trying to devote himself to education, but when the general educational system changed, everything was transferred to Handa School. The wooden plaque for Jūshū Gakusha was written by the old man and is still preserved and displayed at Hanada Elementary School, which brings back fond memories. At that time in our region, many scholars and men of purpose from east and west visited the old man, but many also visited Takao's residence, and both were well known and both entertained guests warmly.

When the imperial carriage made its eastern progress in the first year of Meiji (1868), the court issued commands to the domain lords along the route to honor elderly persons, filial children, virtuous widows, righteous servants, and others, and a total of thirty-six people from Yoshida domain were so honored. Prior to this, the old man consulted with Takao and Sano Hōu and others, invited six filial sons from the Yoshida area to Takao's residence, where domain lord Nobutō attended in person to feast them and give rewards.

One of them, Makino Yonosuke (age 64) from Imashin-machi (now Nishi-shin-machi), was devoted in caring for his elderly mother Tatsu (age 87). He received from the domain lord a reward of five bales of rice and lifelong support for one person, bringing him great honor. This man was skilled in amateur painting, and in his joy before the domain lord, he painted a sea bream and bamboo leaves on half-size paper. The old man added the following poem as an inscription above it.

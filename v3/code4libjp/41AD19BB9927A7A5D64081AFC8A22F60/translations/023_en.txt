The shogunate's request was rejected, and the Daigaku-no-kami and others returned to Edo empty-handed. By this time, the imperial loyalist and anti-foreign party in Kyoto had gradually extended their influence, and voices calling for the overthrow of the shogunate were rising, so the imperial court further declared that treaty matters should be decided by public opinion among the various domains, making imperial approval for signing increasingly unlikely. However, even the shogunate, when Perry first arrived and other foreign vessels came, was initially prepared to fight without hesitation, as evidenced by Ii Naosuke having his retainer Utsuki Daikan (styled Goshō) inspect the defenses at Uraga. But gradually, as they listened to foreigners and learned about foreign circumstances, they came to understand that taking a softer stance was unavoidable. Since the old man was also well acquainted with Daikan through poetry composition, he composed twelve poems and sent them to him.

"Feeling Moved, I Send This to Lord Utsuki"

"Strategists in confusion vainly guard their positions, their coastal defense plans amount to mere entertainment. Cannon platforms and gun racks serve only for sightseeing, giving no thought to their practical application."

"People say large ships are difficult to use. I say large ships have their essential purpose. I recall how the Zhou family learned naval warfare and achieved mastery in just a few months."

The latter half of the poem references the story from the Records of the Three Kingdoms where Wu's Zhou Yu defeated Wei's large army at the Battle of Red Cliffs with a small navy, satirizing the weakness of the shogunate's coastal defense.

"Foreign ships come and go frequently. Before our eyes the seas gather clouds of dust. The watchtower stands close to Kamakura's land, mourning for those of heroic determination in the Kōan era."

This sixth year of Showa marks exactly 650 years since the Mongol invasions. There are those who should take the old man's poem to heart.

"Do not rely on their not coming, but be prepared for their arrival. The strategy of preparedness lies in daily readiness. Build great ships and establish military units, train the garrison troops of the coastal areas."

These twenty-eight characters form a magnificent theory of coastal defense.

Earlier, the old man's teacher Seigan had suddenly left Edo and moved to the banks of the Kamo River in Kyoto, calling himself "Kamo-so Shōin," spending his time in leisure with poetry and wine, indulging in composition. Yet behind the scenes, he associated with many loyalist and anti-foreign activists, working to cultivate the spirit of restoration. At this time, our political situation also faced a complex problem: Shogun Iesada was sickly and childless, and there was urgent pressure to determine his successor. Several domains centered on Owari, Echizen, and Satsuma sought to install Mito Nariaki's eighth son, Hitotsubashi Tokugawa Yoshinobu, while a faction led by the shogunate's central figure Ii Naosuke and others promoted the young lord of Kii, Tokugawa Yoshitomi, with both sides competing fiercely. These circumstances became entangled with foreign policy issues, and as a result, the shogunate finally appointed the highly reputed Ii Naosuke to the position of Tairō (Great Elder), the highest position above the rōjū (senior councilors), in Ansei 5. Naosuke first decisively signed the problematic treaty with America without waiting for imperial approval, causing loyalist activists throughout the land to rise up in fierce denunciation of this violation of imperial will, further complicating the situation. While Naosuke reported the unavoidable circumstances of the signing, he also decided to install Tokugawa Yoshitomi as the shogun's successor, causing loyalist anti-foreign theory and anti-shogunate theory to become further entangled. The imperial court then considered having the imperial court and military government work together to handle national affairs, urging the Tairō and the three related domains to come to Kyoto. As it happened, Shogun Iesada died and the shogunate was occupied with many affairs, so the Tairō did not go to Kyoto, instead responding that he would send rōjū Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami Akikatsu to Kyoto. Then, having made a great decision, he established a policy of imposing major suppression on the anti-shogunate party, mainly consisting of Mito faction activists, and carried it out.

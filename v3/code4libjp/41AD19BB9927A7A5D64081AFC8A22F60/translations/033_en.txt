This was the underlying cause of the Charter Oath in Five Articles, and also the foundation of our nation's constitutional government. Takayoshi also early implemented the return of domain registers to cut off petty disputes over trifles, and after returning from his trip abroad, he hoped even more for the development of national unity. His psychology in advocating that the Taiwan Expedition was premature and leaving his post showed that he was a person of different caliber from those who advocated so-called domain clique autocracy and were intoxicated with rejecting everything associated with the Tokugawa system. Someone like the old man was probably one of those with whom he was deeply intimate. Moreover, when the old man was appointed to handle national affairs at the Nijō house, there were many people from Chōshū among those handling national affairs, so it appears that the old man had repeated close contact with Takayoshi. When the old man resigned from office to care for his mother and immediately visited Takayoshi who was in Kyoto, Takayoshi had already departed for his home region and they could not meet. In the "Poetry Screen" that the old man published in later years, the following poem is recorded. This poem also reveals something of Takayoshi's psychology.

"Feelings on the Year of the Great Political Renewal" by Shōkiku
"Changes are just like the yellow plum season. Half a day's clear or cloudy weather cannot be known. The time that has been coming for seven hundred years has nearly arrived. In danger and doubt, I again fear missing the right opportunity."

The old man arrived at Edo Castle three days after the imperial carriage and was further appointed as acting secretary (ken-benji) of the General Affairs Bureau. He was fifty-five years old at the time. At this time, the central government of the Meiji restoration initially established seven departments under the Daijōkan, placing a governor over each department to share administrative responsibilities. Soon the seven departments were changed to eight bureaus (General Affairs, Shinto Affairs, Domestic Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Military Defense, Accounting, Criminal Law, and Institutions). All secretaries belonged to the General Affairs Bureau, were appointed from among the court nobles and recruited scholars serving as councilors, and handled palace and domestic and foreign general affairs. Regular appointments were imperial appointments, while acting appointments were memorialized appointments, and the old man held what would now be the first rank of memorialized appointment and became head of the Records Bureau.

Now, as a matter of sequence, let me write a little about the swordsman Kenshirō. Kaneko Kenshirō Norikatsu (pen name Hōsui), originally named Bushirō, was born as the second son of fish merchant Kaneko Heigoro of Uo-machi in Yoshida. He studied painting as a disciple of Watanabe Kazan and was particularly skillful at painting bamboo. He was also fond of martial arts. Kazan, concerned that Tahara domain's traditional swordsmanship was the Jikishin-ryū, a form-based sword technique that would not be practical in actual emergencies, and worried that domain retainers might become weak, conspired with Edo swordsmen Sugiyama Tōshichirō and Saitō Yakurō to introduce the Shintō Munen-ryū to his domain, sending Kenshirō to Edo to study swordsmanship single-mindedly. When Kenshirō was later hired by Mito, Fujita Tōko's background investigation report states:

"Kaneko Bushirō, age twenty-six. His ancestors were warriors who became physicians, and later resided in Uo-machi, Yoshida, Mikawa Province. His father was called Heigoro Takamasa, who died six years ago, and currently his older brother called Tokusaburō takes care of him. Bushirō has loved martial arts since childhood, followed Sugiyama Tōshichirō and wandered various provinces, intending to make his living by the sword. He has been removed from the population register of Yoshida, etc."

His brother Tokusaburō was a fish seller, but Kenshirō was an eccentric. He was a giant of a man, five feet seven inches tall and weighing twenty-three to twenty-four kan. When he was in Tahara and came to Toyohashi with the also tall Kazan, both would attract attention. His wife Sachi was the daughter of Mito domain retainer Andō Shuzō-no-suke Nobuaki (sister of Hiko-no-shin Nobuyuki) and served in the palace of domain lord Nariaki. Hiko-no-shin was in charge of the Kōdōkan martial arts ground but joined Takeda Kōun-sai's uprising and became one of those who left the domain. When the affair failed, he was executed in Tsuruga. The Andō family was continued by Kenshirō's youngest son Gorōsaburō Noriaki, who became a person of Chōshū (Suō). Gorōsaburō's eldest son currently lives in Osaka, and his son Noriki graduated from Hiroshima Army Youth School and briefly became a soldier, but changed his aspirations and entered the History Department of the Literature Faculty at Kyoto Imperial University, where he is currently researching national history. The Kaneko family of Uo-machi in Toyohashi continued to be fish merchants for a long time afterward, but now deals in cotton bedding and such. The current Yonesaburō is an adopted heir, and up until the previous generation they were still called Heigoro. His wife is somewhat related to Kenshirō, and the family preserves several relics including Kenshirō's calligraphy, records of disciples' names, and other items.

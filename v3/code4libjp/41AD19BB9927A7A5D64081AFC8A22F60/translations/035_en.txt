Someone like him had first-dan level skill at seventeen, but being poor, he could not attend the dōjō. Kenshirō, out of chivalrous spirit, taught him without charge and made him into a master swordsman.

[Annotation: After Senior Councilor Ii was killed, next came the attack on Senior Councilor Andō outside Sakashita Gate. While this enterprise was mainly led by Kōno Kenzō from Shimotsuke and Kawamoto Moritarō from Echigo, there were five Mito rōnin including Hirayama Heisuke and below, all of whom were also Kenshirō's disciples. One of them, Uchida Man-no-suke, arrived late and visited Katsura Kogorō (Kido) at the Chōshū domain residence in Sakurada, where he committed seppuku. This episode is also found in a section of Itō Hirobumi's reminiscences. Later, Kenshirō, together with Ariga Heiya and Okami Jirō, attacked British Minister Alcock on his return journey from Takanawa Tōzen-ji. When loyalist patriots gathered in Kyoto in succession, Kenshirō entered the Satsuma residence and received support from Saigō Kichi-no-suke (Takamori). He is also said to have participated in a faction's movement to have Chōshū forces replace the Mito domain lord and take control of the anti-foreign party. Regrettably, he died as a guest in Kyoto in April of Genji 1 at the age of fifty.]

If he had been allowed to live another ten or more years, he would have left behind the reputation of another admirable gentleman in our Higashi Mikawa region. The story has diverged greatly, but the fact that the old man got along well with Kenshirō and was close to him was by no means accidental, despite the difference between literary and martial pursuits. Therefore, in the matter of the old man submitting a letter to the court through Fukuyama Chamberlain, there appears to have been Kenshirō's mediation.

When the old man was summoned to Edo as a conscripted scholar, his poetry before and after was considerable. I now record several of his poems below.

Respectfully Reading the Imperial Edict of December 7th
The revival of the Tang house was Han Yu's pen. The achievements at Huaixi were called incomparable. The sage emperor's decision was truly divine and martial. Suppressing rebels and achieving success without killing those who surrendered.

Respectfully Viewing the Eastern Progress Ceremony on the First Day of October, Boshin
The imperial palanquin crosses many mountains and rivers from afar. The ceremonial dress of civil and military officials is brilliant. Though we examine ancient histories of northern hunts and southern tours, we have never heard of a grand ceremony like this year's.

These twenty-eight characters are not inferior to the poetry and history of predecessors.

Having Received Conscription, About to Depart for Tokyo
For how many years have I dwelt lazily in my humble hut. Suddenly I am startled by a crane carrying a letter to the eaves. I faintly hear that the evil miasma over the world has been extinguished. I immediately feel the harmonious air of the cold forest relaxing. After the festival, chrysanthemums still concentrate their colors. Before the season arrives, plum blossoms have already begun to release their fragrance. Leaving the gate with a smile, I bid farewell to my children. I dare to borrow this imperial favor to boast in my neighborhood.

The old man was fifty-five at this time, with half his life's deeds completed and about to open a new phase of life. The beauty of the latter couplet is not easy to read casually.

Mount Hakone
The brocade banners flutter brilliantly, illuminating the ivy. The assembled spirits sweep the road while a hundred gods give way. The jade-green imperial banner needs no six-dragon carriage. Such mountain passes are easily crossed.

New Year's Day, Meiji 2, at Tokyo Castle (First?)
I see with my eyes auspicious light shining over the great ocean. With loud cheers and flowery congratulations, we praise the ascendant peace. Political power restored to antiquity after three thousand years. Declaring authority through conquest with a hundred thousand troops. The graciously bestowed cup is deep, increasing our joyful expression. The warm spring air is abundant, filling us with sounds of celebration. Knowing there is a day to welcome the imperial phoenix, it is not far away. In the end, the new capital surpasses the old capital.

The seventh and eighth lines of this poem refer to the imperial palanquin returning to Tokyo and finally establishing the eternal foundation.

Since the patriots from high and low ranks gathered in the capital were devoted to the enterprise of founding [the new government], the old man, besides being head of the Records Bureau, [dealt] with important positions...

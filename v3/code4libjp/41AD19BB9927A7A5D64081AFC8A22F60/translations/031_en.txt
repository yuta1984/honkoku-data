provinces, there was considerable turmoil throughout. Particularly in the case of Owari, being a large domain with no shortage of talented people, it was consequently in turmoil. The old man, who was in Kyoto, first went on a mission to Owari domain as a member of the "National Affairs Office," unified the people's hearts in that domain, and also called for the gathering of senior retainers from the various Mikawa domains. By forcefully explaining where justice and duty lay, he was able to prevent unrest.

At that time, in addition to the National Affairs Office, the court also established a General Affairs Office. The people of these two offices attended the imperial palace daily from what would now be 11 AM to 3 PM, submitting written opinions without reserve (what we would call draft proposals today) for discussion. If opinions could not be reached, His Majesty would personally come out to the Small Imperial Palace, and after hearing the circumstances from the Regent, would graciously render imperial judgment—truly an most awesome responsibility.

Owari domain was fortunate that its lord Tokugawa Yoshikatsu was intelligent, with no shortage of talented senior retainers. Having well understood the trends of the times, they preserved their reputation, and the various Mikawa domains also kept roughly the same pace in supporting the imperial restoration. The old man's mission was completely accomplished.

On September 8th of this year, the era was changed from Keiō to Meiji, and soon the Emperor's journey to Edo was announced. On the 20th, the imperial carriage departed Kyoto, and on the 29th, His Majesty stopped in our Yoshida (arriving in Edo on October 3rd; Edo was renamed Tokyo on the 17th). The Yoshida temporary palace was at the honjin of Nakanishi Yoemon (Kiyosu-ya) on the north side of central Fudagi-machi (at what is now Shindō street) (the second imperial visit was at Gōshinji temple in Sekio-machi). The chief attendant was Councilor Kido Takayoshi, and others accompanying included the Tosa Major General, Katō Tōtōmi-no-kami, Inaba Chūjō, Ikeda Tango-no-kami, Katō Izumo-no-kami, Hirano Kurando-no-kami, Satsuma Major General, Nagato Chancellor, Hizen Major General, Hikone Chūjō, and Inuyama Naruse Hayato-no-shō. Takayoshi used Kikuoka in Fudagi-machi as his inn, and that very night sent a messenger to the old man's residence to invite him and held a banquet. First raising cups to mutually celebrate the accomplishment of the imperial restoration's purpose, Takayoshi, at his host's request, wielded his brush and wrote a five-character plaque reading "Heaven and Earth Like One Family." The old man then, on the following day, through Takayoshi's recommendation, attended at the temporary palace, had an audience with His Majesty, and was appointed as a chōshi (recruited scholar). His Majesty at this time was seventeen years of age.

Chōshi refers to the system from this year until June of Meiji 2, whereby talented individuals were selected by the court regardless of domain or urban/rural distinction, and appointed as councilors or judges and administrators of various bureaus. Those serving four years who had circumstances making retirement difficult could extend for another four years. Below chōshi were kōshi (tribute scholars): large domains (over 400,000 koku) provided three, medium domains (100,000 to 390,000 koku) provided two, and small domains (10,000 to 90,000 koku) provided one each. Personnel selection and terms were left entirely to the domains' discretion, and talented kōshi could advance to chōshi. That the old man's appointment as chōshi was made at the temporary palace was considered quite exceptional.

[Middle section inscription]
These five large characters on this plaque are the authentic brushwork of the late Cabinet Advisor Lord Kido. In the year of Boshin, when the imperial carriage made its eastern journey, the lord accompanied it and lodged at Kikuoka Tower in Toyohashi. The tower master requested the lord's calligraphy, and during drinking he cheerfully wrote several sheets, wielding his brush. These five characters did not suit his intention, so he omitted signature and seal. However, during his brushwork I was also present and personally observed it—there can be no doubt of this. The master has treasured this for nineteen years and requests a word from me. Therefore I inscribe this. Meiji Kinoe-inu year, Seiwa Festival, Kozan Ono Gen, at age seventy-three.

(The old man being seventy-three corresponds to Meiji 19; collection of Mr. Fukutani Tōtarō of Toyohashi City)

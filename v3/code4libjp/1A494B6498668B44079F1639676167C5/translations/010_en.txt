　　　　　　　　　　　　2. Climate
The climate is generally mild, with heat that is not particularly severe, and even during the harsh winter season, snow and frost are rarely seen, creating a state of moderate temperature year-round. There are particularly few natural disasters, and consequently, many people have come to live in our city in recent years. The prosperity of commerce and industry has been achieved entirely due to this favorable climate.

　　　　　　　　　　　　3. Location and Topography
The city is located at 137°23' East longitude and 34°45' North latitude, in the eastern part of Aichi Prefecture, almost midway between Tokyo and Kobe.
To the east, the Akaishi Mountain Range extends, and to the south, the highland area of Tenpaku Plain is situated, with the terrain being generally flat. The Toyokawa, Umeda, and Yagyu rivers flow through the city and empty into Atsumi Bay. The geology consists of alluvial deposits in the lowlands and diluvial deposits in the highlands.

　　　　　　　　　　　　4. Extent and Area
The city extends 14.51 km east-west and 14.25 km north-south, with an area of 104.51 square kilometers (approximately 10.23 km on each side). In terms of size, it is a major city ranking after Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya, Yokohama, and Shizuoka among Japanese cities.

　　　　　　　　　　　　5. Population and Number of Households
When municipal status was established in Meiji 39 (1906), there were only 37,635 residents and 9,900 households. Since then, the population has gradually increased, and particularly as a result of the merger of neighboring towns and villages in Shōwa 7 (1932), it expanded rapidly. By the end of Shōwa 9 (1934), the population reached 147,735 with 27,274 households, and the continuing year-by-year increase must be considered a truly welcome phenomenon.

　　　　　　　　　2. Agriculture
　　　　　　　　　　　　1. Farmland and Number of Farm Households
Both farm households and farmland saw rapid increases due to the merger of towns and villages in Shōwa 7 (1932). Currently, there are 4,891 farm households with a total area of 553,717 ares, consisting of 303,376 ares of rice fields and 250,341 ares of dry fields. However, it is an unavoidable fact that both farm households and farmland will gradually decrease as the city develops. Agricultural management continues to center on rice and wheat cultivation, supplemented by sweet potato cultivation. In recent years, greenhouse horticulture has gradually developed, and the cultivation of flowers and vegetables is being encouraged as urban-oriented agriculture.

The city has Toyohashi Port nearby where ships are constantly crowded. The water depth is generally not deep, reaching only about 3 meters even at high tide. In view of the considerable inconvenience this causes for ship traffic, discussions are now proceeding to implement Toyokawa River improvement works. This will likely be realized in the near future. As a coastal city and as Toyohashi City which will soon connect the Pacific side and Japan Sea side through the Sanshin Railway, it must be said that not having a complete major port is rather a mysterious fact. Therefore, there are recent plans to select an appropriate location and construct a new port, and when this is completed, maritime and land transportation will be most convenient, and there is no doubt that the city's reputation will be further renewed.

As for water transport, there is separately the Yagyu River canal, and at the river mouth there is Muro Port, which exclusively handles goods from the Atsumi Peninsula area.

The situation of freight distribution in the city during Showa 9 (1934) was as follows: imports and transfers by rail were 18,413,122 yen, exports and transfers were 27,797,617 yen; imports and transfers by ship were 10,157,695 yen, exports and transfers were 2,246,539 yen; imports by automobile were 14,015,516 yen, exports were 7,020,213 yen. The total imports and transfers amounted to 42,586,286 yen, and exports and transfers were 37,382,449 yen.

9. Conclusion

As described above, our Toyohashi City occupies a pivotal position in central Japan, with population increasing day by day, industry becoming more prosperous year by year, cultural institutions becoming increasingly well-equipped, transportation extending in all directions, and in combination with the completion of maritime and land facilities, the city is about to attempt a great leap forward. We believe that the city's development is remarkable to behold. Particularly, since this city possesses conditions such as a mild climate, simple and frugal lifestyle, diligent and steady citizens, and the ability to adapt well to the progress of the times with a spirit of enterprise, we firmly believe that the day when various industries will flourish and the realization of a truly great Toyohashi City in both name and reality is not far away.

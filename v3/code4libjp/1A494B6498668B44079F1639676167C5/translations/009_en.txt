　　　　　　　　　I. General Survey
　　　　　　　　　　　　1. History
　Toyohashi City has appeared in historical records since ancient times. The Hata-go in Atsumi District and Tame-go in Yana District of Mikawa Province recorded in the Wamyō-ruiju-shō are present-day Hanada-cho and Tame-cho within the city. Also, the Akumi-shinkanbe dedicated to the Grand Imperial Shrine by the imperial court in Tengyō 3 (940) as an offering of gratitude for the suppression of Taira no Masakado's rebellion is present-day Toyohashi. During the Kamakura period, it became an important route for transportation between the eastern provinces and Kyoto. After Makino Kohaku built Imahashi Castle (i.e., Yoshida Castle) in Eishō 2 (1505), it suddenly became a strategically important military location. Subsequently, with Ikeda Terumasa's expansion of the castle grounds, it saw further development. During the Edo period, it was known as Yoshida-juku, one of the fifty-three stations on the Tōkaidō. Popular songs such as "When passing through Yoshida, someone beckons from the second floor, wearing a spotted silk furisode" from the dance piece Sanshō-zaru performed by the famous actor Ichikawa Danjūrō in the early Bunsei era, and lines from the jōruri "Iga-goe Dōchū Sugoroku" stating "Matago-rō settles down in Sagara, Kyushu, and rumors say he met someone on the road in Sanshū Yoshida" became widely known among the people. Maritime transportation to the Ise region was also established, making it the cultural center of Eastern Mikawa.
The place name was initially called Imahashi, later called Yoshida, and changed to Toyohashi in Meiji 2 (1869). In Meiji 4 (1871), it belonged to Mikawa Prefecture, but later went through transitions as Ina Prefecture and Nukata Prefecture before finally becoming part of Aichi Prefecture, where a district assembly office was established. Municipal status was granted in August Meiji 39 (1906), and in Shōwa 7 (1932), neighboring towns and villages were incorporated, finally resulting in the establishment of Greater Toyohashi City.

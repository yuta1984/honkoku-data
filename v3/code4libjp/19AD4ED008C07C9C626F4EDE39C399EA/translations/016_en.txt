　　　　　　　　　47　Yakuharai (Misfortune Purification)
　The misfortune purifiers who walked around on New Year's Eve and Setsubun night calling "Let's purify misfortunes, remove bad luck" are rarely seen now, but were once popular. In Kyoto-Osaka they came on Setsubun night, and in Edo since Bunka 1 (1804) they came on New Year's Eve and the year-crossing nights of January 6th and 14th.
In this region they come on New Year's Eve, year-crossing night, and Setsubun night.
　　　　　　　　　48　Kotohajime and Kotonōme (Beginning and Ending of Affairs)
　February 8th is called kotohajime, December 8th kotonōme, or conversely February 8th kotonōme, December 8th kotohajime. December 8th is said to begin New Year preparations, or to conclude them, or to mark the beginning and end of agricultural work—there have been various theories since ancient times. According to seasonal almanacs, eye-baskets are attached to bamboo poles and displayed from house eaves, and six ingredients—burdock, taro, daikon radish, red adzuki beans, etc.—are boiled into soup called mushitsu-jiru (six-ingredient soup).
　　　　　　　　　49　Hari Kuyō (Needle Memorial Service)　(8th day)
　Women collect broken needles and present them to Awashima shrine, suspending needlework for one day. This is called needle memorial service. In recent years, girls' schools have added various new features to the needle memorial service. In this region's needlework shops, all suspend work, maintain sewing tools, make noppei soup, offer meals to sewing tools, and entertain seamstresses.
　A. Place fresh tofu on a tray or sanpō stand, insert broken needles and needles with damaged eyes, boil taro, adzuki beans, konjac, etc., put in a pot and offer in worship. Afterwards the needles are placed in cycad plants, etc. (Ōmura)

In the evening villagers gathered at Kasuga shrine, used the paper and straw to make very large linga and yoni, placed them on small boats, and after monks' sutra chanting, beat gongs while circling the shrine once counterclockwise, then took them to Okata-ba to float away. This was performed as misfortune purification until 35-36 years ago. (Tame)

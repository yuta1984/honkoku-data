　　　　　　　　　　　　(4) Guidelines for Inpatients
1. Although tuberculosis is certainly not an incurable disease, the opportunity for recovery may be lost if daily health management is not carefully observed.
2. Health management is not merely a matter of daily activities and diet. Since psychological influence is extremely significant in treating illness, it involves not causing unnecessary anxiety or dissatisfaction, cultivating patience and self-respect, fostering the spirit to overcome disease, and being careful not to violate hygiene in all daily matters.
3. Small fluctuations in condition during treatment are unavoidable. Therefore, one should not despair over minor deteriorations, not become careless during improvements, trust the medical staff's treatment, and steadily aim for complete recovery.
4. Since this hospital is a place to be used by many patients, one should refrain from selfish behavior that causes trouble for others, maintain mutual courtesy, comfort and support each other in harmony, enjoy together, and strive to make this a paradise for treatment.
5. Although one or two guidelines for treatment and hospital life are insufficient, the main points are listed here to serve as daily standards. It is hoped that each person will understand these well and work toward the smooth execution of hospital affairs.
　　1. Follow the instructions of medical staff, administrative staff, and nurses regarding treatment
　　2. Conduct daily activities and meals at the prescribed times of this facility
　　3. Regarding medicines and other food and beverages, except for those provided by this hospital, do not arbitrarily purchase or store food items or cook for oneself without permission from medical staff (continued)

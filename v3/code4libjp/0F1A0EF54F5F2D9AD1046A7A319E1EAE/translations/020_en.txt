This is because the force by which air presses on objects is inherently weak - for example, while air measures forty-three shō, water measures one hundred thousand shō. Therefore, unless force accumulates and presses down from such heights as mentioned above, objects would not fall and come close to the earth.

Air constantly envelops the Earth and moves by itself, traveling along with the Earth's daily rotation and annual revolution. However, it is not entirely motionless, but sometimes flows and moves from place to place. This is called wind. According to the direction from which it blows, there are various names for directional winds. Also, according to the intensity of its force, there are distinctions such as gentle wind <<marginal note: Sachte Wind>>, strong wind <<marginal note: Sterke Wind>>, storm wind <<marginal note: Storm Wind>>, and hurricane <<marginal note: Orkaan>>.

Movement of ten to fifteen shaku per second is called gentle wind. Twenty-five to thirty-five shaku is called strong wind. Forty to sixty shaku is called storm wind. Movement even more intense than this is called hurricane. Japan and the countries of the western seaboard of Asia have many hurricanes.

Generally, wind normally blows straight and parallel to the ground surface. However, some blow down from above, and some spiral. This is named "Wervel Wind" (whirlwind). In severe cases, "Water Boos-

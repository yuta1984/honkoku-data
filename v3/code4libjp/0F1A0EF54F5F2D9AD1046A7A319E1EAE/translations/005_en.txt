A line drawn horizontally, namely what is illustrated as ab, is this.

The end of the earth's axis located in the north is called "Noordel-Aspunt" or "Noord-Pool" (namely, directly below the North Pole). The total surface area of the earth is 9,292,183 square ri according to German national road measurement. However, one square ri in German measurement corresponds to 6,448.5 "Morgen" ("Morgen" is six shaku and five sun square, equivalent to 1,130 tsubo).

The entire surface of the earth is divided using circles ("Sirkel"). Among these circles, the one whose center passes through the center of the earth has the greatest length. And as the distance from the earth's central line increases, the length gradually decreases. All circles, regardless of their length, are divided into 360 parts. This is called "Graad" (degrees). Also, dividing "Graad" into sixty parts is called "Minuut" (minutes). Also, dividing "Minuut" into sixty parts is called "Seconde" (seconds). Generally, "Graad," "Minuut," and "Seconde" are not the same depending on the size of the circle. Among the large circles, one is called "Evenaar" (equatorial circle), and one is called "Middaf-Sirkels" (meridian circle). These are the most important for determining the orientation of provinces and lands. Small circles are called "Evenweiden."

The first large circle, "Evenaar" or "Evennacht-Rein" (meaning equal day and night), is a line that spans east-west between the two poles. The two poles are

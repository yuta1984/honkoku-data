n) <<marginal note: commonly called waterspouts and similar phenomena>>正帯 regions have unstable winds - sometimes easterly, sometimes westerly, changing daily. Tropical regions mostly have winds with regular patterns that do not change daily. That is, winds that blow continuously from one direction throughout the year are called "Passaat" (trade) winds. Those that change at set times during the year are called "Periodieke" (periodic) winds.

In the great oceans one to two degrees from the tropics, easterly trade winds blow. However, they vary according to the position of the sun. That is, in the tropic north of the equator they blow somewhat toward the northwest, and in the tropic south of the equator they blow somewhat toward the southwest.

At ten degrees north and south of the equator, winds from one direction persist for several months, then suddenly cease due to storms or thunderstorms, changing to winds from the opposite direction that persist for several months. This is called "Mouson" (monsoon). This is a type of "Periodieke" wind.

In coastal areas of tropical regions, a type of "Periodieke" wind blows. That is, sea breezes blow daily and change to land breezes nightly. This is because the sun's heat penetrates the sea more slowly compared to land, and its dissipation is also

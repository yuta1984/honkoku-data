also slow. Therefore, when the temperature over the sea during the day is not yet extremely intense, the land has already reached the peak of heat, so the air over land tilts and disperses toward the sea. Also, the sea gradually heats up during the day and does not quickly cool even at night. At this time, the hot air over land has already dissipated. For this reason, the air over land tilts and disperses toward the sea.

The quality of wind varies according to the land from which it blows. That is, north winds arise from the perpetually frozen lands directly under the North Pole and cross over snow-covered and ice-covered mountains, so they are intensely cold. East winds pass through vast empty lands, so they are dry. West winds cross over great oceans, so they are humid.

However, in Naples they cause harm by weakening and debilitating the human body. Also, in the Italian states, when this wind continues to blow, people find themselves feeling mental depression and decline. This is because in these regions this wind affects what the ears and eyes perceive

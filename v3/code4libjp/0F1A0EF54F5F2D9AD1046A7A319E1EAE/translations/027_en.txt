The mountain ranges begin from Chimborazo, extending south to Cape Horn and north to the Isthmus of Panama. From here, the mountain ranges connect continuously to reach the high mountains of Mexico. Also, the mountain ranges of the Cordillera de los Andes branch off and extend continuously eastward. Between the 10th and 20th degrees of south latitude are high mountains. These branched mountains extend from Peru and Brazil in the south to Cape Tangier.

There are also mountain ranges in Canada, whose branches pass through Newfoundland, go south through Florida, cross the Yucatan and Antilles islands, and connect to the branch mountains of the Cordillera of Venezuela.

degrees. The eastern part of this mountain connects to the mountains of Asia, and to the north it encircles Sweden, forming the boundary between this country and Finland and Norway.

The third highest mountain in Europe is in Bohemia, namely from latitude 48 degrees 30 minutes to 51 degrees, and from longitude 25 degrees 30 minutes to 34 degrees 30 minutes.

These three great mountain chains are the main mountain systems of Europe. Small mountain clusters branch off from these and extend in all directions, spreading throughout the entire continent.

The highest place in Asia is in Tibet, being 300 miles long and 150 miles wide. The mountain chains of all Asia branch off from here: to the south reaching the tip of the East Indian peninsula, to the west passing through Persia and Turkey to connect with European mountains, passing through Asia Minor and Arabia to reach the Isthmus of Suez and connect with African mountains.

In the north and northeast of Asia there is also one great mountain range that reaches the Bering Strait and connects with the mountains of America.

limited monarchy (meaning to receive commands from other countries), and republic or community governance (meaning that the heroes of the nation deliberate together to govern).

In absolute monarchy, the greatest rulers are called Emperor, King, Sultan (Supreme Emperor), etc. The lesser ones have titles such as Elector, Archduke (meaning grand duke), Grand Duke, Great Prince, Duke, Margrave, Landgrave (provincial lord), Burgrave, Count, Padishah, Emir, etc.

In limited monarchy, the titles of the rulers are the same as above, but their governmental decrees have sources from which they must receive approval, and they cannot establish them independently.

Republic or community governance has two types. One is to establish elderly people from the country as assembly leaders to receive commands from. This is called aristocracy. The other is to select people who possess both talent and virtue as assembly leaders. This is called democracy.

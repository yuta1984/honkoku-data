Chapter 7: The Sea
Water occupies two-thirds of the world, and its largest bodies are called seas. The sea constitutes a separate world. Therefore, the animals, plants, and minerals that exist here are all different from those that grow on land.

Seawater contains salt and is bitter. This is due to the substances mixed within it. Indeed, this salinity serves great functions. First, the salt produced from it stimulates appetite, prevents decay, and aids digestion. Also,

saltwater does not freeze easily, thus preventing ice formation on the sea surface. It also quickly decomposes and disperses dead matter and filth. Moreover, seawater is heavy due to its salt content. Therefore, it is superior to fresh water in supporting ships carrying heavy loads.

The movement of the sea has considerable utility. This movement is sometimes violent and sometimes gentle. However, even at its most violent, it does not extend deeper than 15 feet below the sea surface.

What causes the movement of the sea are wind, ocean currents, and the moon. Ocean currents flow from east to west between the two solstices, and from the north and south poles toward the equator outside the solstices. Tides are great

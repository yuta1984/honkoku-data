The Earth has two types of movement. The first is rotation on its own axis within twenty-four hours (equivalent to twelve hours in Japan), creating day and night - this is called the first orbit. The second is revolution around the sun in 365 days, 5 hours (equivalent to 2.5 hours in Japan), 48 minutes (one minute equals 120 Japanese time units), and 45 seconds (one second is 1/60th of a minute), creating one year - this is called the second orbit. The second orbit involves carrying the moon while moving, and this harmonizes with the rotation of the first orbit, much like a spinning top ("turtle") that rotates on its axis while also having its own orbital movement.

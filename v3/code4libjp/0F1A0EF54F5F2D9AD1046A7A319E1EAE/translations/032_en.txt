Holstel counted the ice blocks visible from aboard the ship and found 150. However, a person who observed from the mast top counted 168. Moreover, among these, there were some measuring half a mile (half a ri) in length.

The icy seas beneath the South Pole are particularly vast compared to those beneath the North Pole, extending extremely far from the South Pole. There are hot springs at the bottom of icy seas, such as those found along the western shores of Iceland (Ice Country).

There have been experiments measuring temperature differences according to depth in the Atlantic Ocean, as follows:

At a depth of 500 feet, the thermometer was left for five minutes.
At a depth of 1,200 feet, it registered 7 degrees 5 minutes. However, at sea level it was 24 degrees 3 minutes.
At a depth of 1,144 feet, the thermometer was left for one hour and fifteen minutes and registered 5 degrees. However, at sea level it was 24 degrees 8 minutes.

The Atlantic Ocean has colors that differ from other seas. The banks near the Cape of Good Hope are deep green in color.

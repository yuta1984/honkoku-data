no traces of remains can be seen. Nieuwe Berg (new mountains) show ash, coal, limestone, sand, marble, and various fossils in their soil. This is clear evidence of new formation in later ages. Vulkanische Berg (volcanic mountains) are precisely volcanoes. These occasionally eject burnt stones, ash, fossils, molten minerals, and flames from their craters. It appears that volcanoes were more numerous in ancient times than now. The traces of burnt mountains can be seen in many places, which is evidence of this. There are 7 volcanoes in Europe, 23 in Asia, 8 in Africa, and 37 in America.

Generally, high places have thin air and are cold. Mountains that tower above the clouds, even though located in tropical regions, constantly have snow and ice on their peaks. According to the degree of this snow, a snow line is established. This line is very high in tropical regions, gradually lower in temperate regions, increasingly lower in frigid zones, and at both the North and South Poles, this line is level with the ground. When measured, the snow line in the center of the tropical zone is 15,000 feet above sea level, at the boundaries (of the tropical zone) it is 12,000 feet, and in the center of the temperate zone it is

...was appointed to this position. Initially, this Ieharu also had great aspirations for governance and showed considerable diligence in his studies, but before long his performance declined, and moreover there were no suitable persons in important positions, so he gradually fell into the evils of the usual soba-yōnin (chamberlain) politics, until finally the well-known Tanuma Tonomo-no-kami Okitsugu came to wield power alone. Originally, this Tanuma Okitsugu was a page to the eighth shogun Yoshimune, succeeded to family headship in Kyōhō 20 (1735), at which time he was a minor retainer with stipend of only 600 koku. However, he was later appointed to Ieharu's personal attendants and gradually gained favor, being elevated to 10,000 koku in Hōreki 8 (1758) and joining the ranks of daimyo. In Meiwa 4 (1767) he received an additional 20,000 koku and became lord of Sagara Castle in Tōtōmi Province, built a new castle and established his base there, and soon in An'ei 1 (1772) was finally appointed rōjū (senior councilor) and reached 57,000 koku. For these reasons, during Ieharu's reign, especially during the Meiwa-An'ei period, Okitsugu's power was extremely strong, morale declined, and bribery became rampant - this is generally recognized. This gives the general outline of conditions at that time, but Matsudaira Nobuaki grew up in precisely such times, and later received recommendation from the person known as Matsudaira Sadanobu, or Shirakawa Rakuō-kō, to serve in an important position in the shogunate and take charge of administrative reform. I would like to describe these matters in order from here.

◎Matsudaira Nobuaki and Shirakawa Rakuō-kō
The person respected throughout the world as Shirakawa Rakuō-kō is, as I mentioned before, the man called Matsudaira Etchū-no-kami Sadanobu. Without my going into tedious detail, he was truly an extraordinary figure and a distinguished retainer who continues to be highly regarded by later generations. I think you gentlemen are already well aware of these matters, but this person was originally the third son of Tayasu Chūnagon Munetake, making him a direct grandson of the eighth shogun Yoshimune. However, due to various circumstances he became the adopted son of Matsudaira Sadakuni, lord of Shirakawa Castle in Ōshū, and

...succeeded to that house. Originally this tenth shogun Ieharu had a real son named Iemoto, but when he died suddenly of illness in February of An'ei 8 (1779), leaving no children, it was decided to adopt from the Hitotsubashi family, and the one who entered and became heir was later known as the eleventh shogun, Ienari. However, this Ienari was not only Yoshimune's great-grandson, but his grandfather Hitotsubashi Munetada was younger brother to Sadanobu's father Munetake, so overall for the Tokugawa shogun family, Sadanobu had much more weight than Ienari. Moreover, as I mentioned before, Sadanobu had been intelligent from childhood, so Okitsugu, who monopolized power at that time, is believed to have been anxious to keep Sadanobu at a distance as much as possible. I won't go into details now, but some quite penetrating theories about this have been passed down. This Sadanobu was born on December 27th of Hōreki 8 (1758), making him exactly five years older than Nobuaki, but from his youth he actively gathered worthy friends to cultivate their spirits, lamenting the times and seeking to contribute greatly for the sake of the world and country. Nobuaki was apparently already known to Sadanobu from around this time, and in Sadanobu's autograph work "Uka no Jingon" (Words of People Under Heaven), he evaluates Nobuaki: "Matsudaira Izu-no-kami is intelligent and good at dealing with people. One could say his talent exceeds his virtue. Also, he conceals nothing from me and shows his true heart, and often supplements my deficiencies." However, this book was a secret document not permitted to be shown to others, so I have not yet had the opportunity to see it myself, but I was able to hear this story from a certain senior recently. Moreover, the Ōkōchi family fortunately preserves five letters that Sadanobu sent to Nobuaki at that time. These were put away among tools after the Meiji Restoration and had been almost completely forgotten and buried, but former retainer Nagao Kiyoe preserved them with special care during periodic airing, so today they can be introduced to the world as invaluable historical materials. Now that Nagao has passed away, I would like to mention his contributions here.

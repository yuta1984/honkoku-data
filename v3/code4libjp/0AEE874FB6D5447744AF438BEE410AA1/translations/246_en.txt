However, Senior Councillor Hotta and the shogunate, for reasons I mentioned earlier, had initially been overconfident and apparently thought this matter could be resolved in at most ten days. Of course, most of the court nobles at that time were extremely ignorant of foreign affairs and were rigidly bound by conservative customs. Moreover, due to the various relationships mentioned earlier, their fervor was truly formidable.

*Subheading: The Court Forces the Shogunate to Again Seek the Opinions of the Daimyo*
Even within the court, there were disagreements between Former Kanpaku Takatsukasa and Kanpaku Kujō, and there were various circumstances that should be explained, but since I believe you are generally familiar with these matters, I will not elaborate here. In any case, on the 13th of the 2nd month, court deliberations were finally concluded, and three or four articles of opinion were conveyed from both Densō and Gisō to Senior Councillor Hotta. The essence was that the matter of imperial permission for the treaty was most grave, as it caused imperial anxiety regarding the Grand Shrine and the imperial ancestors. Given the imperial intent to prioritize national harmony above all, the emperor wished to know the true feelings of the Three Branch Houses and other daimyo. Therefore, shogunate orders should be issued once more to have the daimyo submit their opinions in writing for imperial review.

Under such circumstances, it was clear that obtaining imperial permission would be extremely difficult. Meanwhile, the deadline for signing with Harris was approaching, and the shogunate found itself caught between opposing forces. Consequently, the shogunate desperately sought to devise strategies for obtaining swift imperial permission and vigorously lobbied among the court nobles.

At that time, Ii Naosuke had a retainer named Nagano Shuzen, who, carrying out Naosuke's wishes, allied himself with Kujō Kanpaku's retainer Shimada Sakon to work toward court-shogunate coordination, hoping to achieve great results. However, this led others to lobby Takatsukasa Kanpaku from the opposite side.

Originally, this Kanpaku's attitude had been somewhat supportive of the shogunate, so certain parties persuaded his steward Mikuni Daigaku, who conspired with his retainer Kobayashi Chikuzen-no-kami to strongly admonish the Kanpaku. I mention this as one example.

Given such circumstances, the confusion in Kyoto at that time reached its peak, with debates among court nobles truly boiling over and various upheavals occurring at all levels. Nevertheless, on the 20th, the following imperial reply was formally conveyed to Senior Councillor Hotta and others from Konoe Safu:

*Subheading: Imperial Reply Regarding Treaty Conclusion*
"Regarding the Black Ships, this great affliction of the divine land relates to the nation's security and is truly no light matter. We reverently think of the successive generations at the Grand Shrine with trepidation. Changes to the good laws established since Tōshō-gū's time would affect the hearts of all people throughout the nation, making eternal security immeasurable and deeply troubling Our imperial thoughts. Moreover, the previous treaty for opening Shimoda was already difficult enough, and now this provisional treaty's terms make it difficult to maintain national dignity. Furthermore, all Our ministers in their group deliberations report that these current articles particularly affect Our national polity and make future troubles unpredictable. We therefore issue commands to the Three Houses and other daimyo below them, and after renewed group deliberations, reports should be submitted."

They were also orally instructed that Senior Councillor Hotta and others should quickly return to Edo and report these matters to the shogun.

*Subheading: Senior Councillor Hotta's Return East*
Senior Councillor Hotta and others' efforts became increasingly desperate, and though they tried various approaches, they could do nothing about the court's general situation. The more they tried, the clearer became the divergence of intentions between court and shogunate. Even the capable Hotta, along with Iwase and Kawaji, found no strategies left to employ. Consequently, Hotta finally took leave of the court on the 3rd of the 4th month, departed Kyoto on the 5th, and returned to Edo for the time being.

In this manner, despite Hotta and others' painstaking journey to Kyoto, they not only failed to obtain imperial permission for the American treaty but actually witnessed increasing estrangement. Simultaneously, this intensified the succession dispute.

*Subheading: Friction Between the Nanki and Hitotsubashi Factions*
As mentioned earlier, the shogunal succession question had from the beginning divided into the Hitotsubashi and Nanki factions. The Hitotsubashi faction gradually extended their activities to Kyoto, hoping to establish Hitotsubashi's succession through imperial command if possible. As I mentioned before, Mito Nariaki himself ardently desired this.

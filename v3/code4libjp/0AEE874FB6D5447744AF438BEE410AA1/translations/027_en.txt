Toyohashi Historical Discussion　　(The Death in Battle of Makino Kohaku)　　　　　　　　　　26

　　　　　　if the ridge plate there were in Kohaku's own handwriting, it would be quite interesting. The characters on this ridge plate are not particularly fine calligraphy,
　　　　　　but they are innocent, unadorned writing in a heroic style that has considerable merit to appreciate. Also, on this ridge plate
《Marginal note: Kohaku claimed the Taira surname》　it says "Taira no Ason Kohaku," and there are three or four other pieces of evidence that he used the Taira surname, so there seems to be some question about the Makino family using the Taira surname at that time,
　　　　　　but since that was the so-called Warring States period when research into history and genealogies was not thorough, it appears they simply claimed the Taira surname because their ancestors had been Taira clan retainers. The fact that the Taguchi clan used the Ki surname was, I believe, discovered through genealogical research during the Tokugawa
Kohaku's Tomb　era from the Kan'ei period onward. Regarding Kohaku's tomb, there are various theories, but
　　　　　　according to what I know, there are tombs at: the tomb in front of Ryūnenji temple in Yoshiya, Toyohashi city; the tomb at Daionji temple in Mito village, Hoi district; and the tomb at Yanagaizu
　　　　　　in Makino village of the same district. "Sanshū Yoshida-ki" records that he was buried at Kōtokuji temple in Kamidenma, Toyohashi city, while newer
　　　　　　Makino family genealogies record that he was buried at Hōgenji temple in Akaiwa. This book called "Sanshū Yoshida-ki" was written by Hayashi Jiken,
　　　　　　a person from Yoshida's cloth merchant district, but I plan to discuss this person later. However, nothing remains at this Kōtokuji temple today,
　　　　　　so there is no evidence, and Hōgenji temple also shows no traces. The tomb at Yanagaizu in Makino village,
　　　　　　as I discussed in the previous chapter, is believed to belong to a completely different person. The tomb at Daionji temple was built in later times,
　　　　　　and while Kohaku's posthumous Buddhist name is indeed carved in, it is certainly not from that period. However, the tomb in front of Ryūnenji temple
　　　　　　alone seems fully trustworthy. But since Ryūnenji temple had not yet been established at that time,
　　　　the temple was actually built later. Indeed, "Kansei Chōshū Shokafu" states:
　　　　　　　"Buddhist name Kohaku. Buried in that place. When his son Denzaemon came of age, he built a temple in that vicinity and called it Ryūnenji. Now that tomb is called Kohaku Mound."
　　　　　　This completely matches the traditions of Ryūnenji temple that remain today. Therefore, regarding Kohaku's tomb, I deeply
Toda Kinshichirō　believe this theory. Now, regarding who defended Imahashi Castle after Kohaku's death in battle, Toda Kinshichirō

　　　　　　was the person, which is agreed upon by all theories. Therefore, if we could clearly determine what kind of person this Toda Kinshichirō was and whether he belonged to the Imagawa side
　　　　　　or the Matsudaira side at that time, we would naturally understand who Kohaku's opponents were, but regrettably, this too remains unclear. "Hankanfu Keizu" identifies this Kinshichirō as
　　　　　　Nobunari and writes that he was Norimitsu's second son, but "Yoshida Castle Lord Study" provides quite detailed research showing that documents from Komatsubara Kannonji temple, Ōkubo's
　　　　　　Chōkōji temple, and other places including Kōyasan Heidōin contain references to Tachibana Shichirō Nobunari, which they record as undoubtedly referring to this person.
　　　　　　This ultimately agrees with "Hankanfu," but questions still remain. However, "Kansei Chōshū Shokafu"
　　　　　　does not include anyone named Nobunari, but instead records that Yasumitsu, grandson of Norimitsu and son of Masamitsu, was called Kinshichirō.
　　　　　　Zenkyūin's genealogy shows Yasumitsu as Masamitsu's younger brother who succeeded him.
　　　　　　I plan to discuss the Toda family in detail in a later chapter, but I want to add these points here for reference.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　⦿Makino Shigekazu and the Place Name Yoshida
　　　　When Kohaku died in battle, he had one son, who later took the name Shigekazu. "Ushikubo Mitsudanki" and "Kan'ei Keizu"
　　　　　　state that he was only five years old when the castle fell. Other books also say he was very young, and he was helped to escape to Chita district in Owari by a retainer named Tomita.
　　　　　　He had a younger brother named Nobushige, and
《Marginal note: Makino Shigekazu recaptures Imahashi Castle》　　after they grew up, they together recaptured Imahashi Castle and again established themselves there. This Shigekazu was initially called Tamikazue but
Makino Nobushige　　due to poor health, he adopted his younger brother Nobushige as his son and soon transferred the family headship to him, changing his own name to Denzaemon, while Nobushige was later called Tamizō or
　　　　　　Denzō. However, no documents record the year and month when these two recaptured Imahashi Castle. Only "Yoshida Castle Lord

...of their failure.

Now, Ieyasu reached Osaka and met with Hideyoshi on the tenth day of the twelfth month of Tenshō 17, staying one night in Yoshida on the second day of his journey. Hideyoshi greatly rejoiced at Ieyasu's arrival in Osaka, and together they entered Kyoto to discuss the subjugation of the Hōjō clan at the Jurakudai palace. Of course, Ieyasu agreed to this, but furthermore, since he had marriage ties with the Hōjō clan as mentioned earlier, he wanted to send his son Nagamaru (Hidetada) as a hostage to avoid suspicion. He sent orders through Sakai Tadayo and others to quickly prepare for Nagamaru's journey to Kyoto. However, Hideyoshi said it would be pitiful to make a young child travel to the capital in such severe cold, so it was decided to wait until the following spring for his journey to the capital. Ieyasu was to begin his return journey on the twelfth day. At this time, Sakai Ienao accompanied Ieyasu, but received orders to relay information about the timing of the Odawara subjugation and military preparations to their home province. The messenger apparently reached eastern Mikawa on the thirteenth day, as the Ietada Diary entry for the thirteenth day records as follows:

"A message came from Sakai Kunai regarding orders from Kyoto about the campaign in Sagami Province. The Kanpaku [Hideyoshi] will depart on the first day of the third month next year, Lord Ōifu of Owari Province on the fifth day of the second month, and Lord Ieyasu on the twenty-eighth day of the first month."

So Ieyasu arrived at Yoshida on the eighteenth day and returned to Sunpu, where he began preparations for the expedition. In the second month of the following year, Tenshō 18, he established thirteen military regulations. Since Hideyoshi's expedition army would pass through his territory, he ordered Ina Binzen-no-kami Tadatsugu to construct a pontoon bridge over the Fuji River, and made thorough preparations such as setting up tea houses at stations along the routes through the three provinces of Suruga, Tōtōmi, and Mikawa as rest stops. In particular, castles at Okazaki, Yoshida, Hamamatsu, Kakegawa, and Tanaka were thoroughly cleaned in preparation for Hideyoshi's arrival. Hideyoshi issued expedition orders on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month of Tenshō 17, and had Nagatsuka Masaie, lord of Minakuchi castle in Ōmi Province, oversee provisions, transporting them by sea to Shimizu port in Suruga and establishing warehouses at Ejiri

...as the base for the expedition army's logistics. He also left Mōri Terumoto in charge of Kyoto, had Hashiba Hideyoshi guard Osaka, and had Kobayakawa Takakage, Kikkawa Hiroie and others, along with Hideyoshi's troops, guard the various castles along the route and manage postal relay and logistics services. Hideyoshi's troops came and stationed at Yoshida Castle. The Tokugawa generals assembled at Sunpu on Ieyasu's orders in the second month of Tenshō 18. Matsudaira Ietada arrived on the fifth day and immediately marched to Ejiri. Ieyasu was supposed to depart the next day, the sixth, but this was postponed due to heavy rain. However, the seven vanguard generals - Sakai Ienao, Honda Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa, Hiraiwa Chikayoshi, Torii Mototada, Ōkubo Tadayo, and Ii Naomasa - departed for Ejiri on the seventh day despite the continuing rain. Ieyasu finally marched to Yui on the tenth day. The Ietada Diary contains detailed accounts of these events, so those wishing to study the facts in detail should examine it carefully. The same diary records that Hideyoshi arrived at Yoshida on the tenth day of the third month and stayed until the thirteenth day. This was because the Toyo River flooded due to the rain, and I believe he stayed in what is now Shimoji. Regarding this matter, the Tokugawa Jitsuroku contains the following account:

"When the Kanpaku attempted to cross the Yoshida River in Mikawa on the eleventh day, a man named Ina who supervised the ferry told him: 'Due to the long rains of recent days, the river water has risen greatly and flows in whirlpools, making it impossible for the army to cross. Perhaps you should wait here a while longer.' The Kanpaku replied: 'Military law states that if there is a river ahead and rain prevents crossing, one cannot cross later either. What difficulty could there be? We must cross by all means.' Ina's eyes flashed with anger as he said: 'This does not seem like Your Lordship's words. Crossing rivers despite rain is a matter for small armies. If a large army attempts to cross a river in flood, many men and horses will inevitably drown. When the enemy hears such rumors, they will exaggerate ten men to a hundred, a hundred to a thousand, adding courage to the enemy's hearts while inviting cowardice among our allies.' The Kanpaku clapped his hands and said: 'Even the lowly officials in the Lord's house possess great military knowledge!' He was greatly impressed and heeded this advice, staying three days before reaching Sunpu on the nineteenth day."

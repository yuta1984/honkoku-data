　　　　　　These matters will be detailed in later chapters.

　　　　　　In such circumstances, Shogun Iemochi finally proceeded with his journey to Kyoto. On February 19th, Yoshinobu, Yoshinaga, Katamori, Yōdō and others met to discuss current affairs, ultimately agreeing that today's problems stemmed from political orders emanating from two sources, so the shogunate should either return political power to the court, or the court should entrust political power exclusively to the shogunate. On the 21st, Yoshinobu urged the regent to consider unifying governmental authority, but this naturally came to nothing. Figures like Yoshinaga became discouraged, as their initial expectations had been thwarted, believing the shogun's journey to Kyoto would ultimately prove fruitless. He personally went out to meet the shogun at Ōtsu during his journey to the capital and advised him that even if imperial edicts for expelling foreigners were issued after his court audience, he should not readily accept them but should wait until military preparations were complete. If this was still not permitted, he suggested the shogun should have no choice but to resign from his position as barbarian-subduing generalissimo. However, at that time the shogunal retainers were filled with the conviction that they should sincerely obey imperial will and ultimately achieve success in expelling foreigners, so Yoshinaga's remonstrations only became targets of criticism. The shogun finally entered Kyoto and on March 7th had an audience with the emperor, personally receiving the imperial edict regarding expulsion of foreigners. At this point Yoshinaga found himself in an impossible situation and submitted his resignation, but the shogun would not accept it, nor would imperial will permit it. While receiving extreme attacks from masterless samurai, he also faced the great difficulty of being pressed for deadlines on foreign expulsion, so Yoshinaga finally secretly fled the capital on March 21st and returned to his domain.

　　　　　　The shogun's journey to the capital began with his departure from Edo on February 13th, traveling the Tōkaidō route and entering Kyoto on March 4th to take residence at Nijō Castle. He stayed one night in Yoshida on February 25th, and according to his journey diary:

　　　　　　　25th day: Departed Hamamatsu station, arrived at Ryūnen-ji temple in Yoshida station. Around 6:30, departed Hamamatsu, took brief rest at Shinohara village and Maisaka post station, delayed slightly there. Crossed to Arai by boat provided as hospitality by Matsudaira Izu-no-kami, had lunch there, [continued to] Shirasuka post station

　　　　　　　26th day: Departed Yoshida station, arrived at Okazaki post station

　　　　　　　Departed same location at 6:30

　　　　　　This is recorded as such. I briefly add and mention this here as well.

　　　　　　As mentioned before, after arriving in Kyoto, the shogun had an audience with the emperor on March 7th to inquire about imperial will. The main points of the imperial edict received in response were: to increasingly obey imperial will, correct the proper relationships between lord and retainer, achieve success in national unity for expelling foreigners, and establish measures for people's allegiance. Regarding national affairs, depending on the matter, direct communications would be sent to various domains, so prior notifications should be prepared. Yoshinobu then submitted further inquiries regarding these national affairs, but from these developments it can be seen that the shogunate's real power naturally declined, and the shogun's actual authority had now reached the point of being almost nonexistent. With facts already being as such, not only court nobles but also activist samurai no longer considered the shogunate relevant, and what had been the banner of "revere the emperor, expel the barbarians" now unhesitatingly evolved into planning "revere the emperor, overthrow the shogunate."

　　　　　　However, examining the mindset of the time, among those favoring opening ports there were indeed far-sighted individuals who properly recognized the benefits of international commerce and earnestly advocated this position, believing it to be the natural course given contemporary circumstances. Others held the view of temporarily deceiving [foreigners] while waiting for military preparations to be completed before gradually rejecting them. But as mentioned before, those who openly and forthrightly advocated opening the country were extremely few in number at the time, and the general trend throughout the realm was overwhelmingly dominated by expulsion advocates. Among the expulsion advocates, some were the most obstinate theorists who seriously considered foreigners as barbarians and viewed allowing them to tread on the sacred land as shameful, while others believed that since foreigners' goal was territorial annexation, the best policy was to avoid relations with them from the beginning.

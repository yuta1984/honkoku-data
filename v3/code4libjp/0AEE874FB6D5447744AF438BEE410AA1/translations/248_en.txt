This is a matter that requires extremely careful consideration.

While on one hand there was great commotion over the succession issue, on the other hand, as I mentioned before, the matter of re-consultation regarding the treaties that Senior Councillor Hotta had received from the court's intentions in Kyoto arose. This too was dealt with by Great Elder Ii's decisive action, who immediately announced it to the daimyo and sought their opinions, and indeed this also caused heated debate for a time.

However, by the end of the 5th month, with the exception of two or three daimyo such as Matsudaira Yoshinaga, most opinions had been gathered.

**Announcement of Establishing an Heir**
Thus, the Senior Councillors apparently believed the time had come, and on the 1st day of the 6th month when the daimyo came to the castle, they detained the Three Houses and Two Lords, and the Great Elder announced that an heir would soon be appointed from among the shogun's close relatives. At that time, it had already been privately decided to establish Kii Yoshitomi as heir, and even the shogun's approval had been obtained, but publicly they did not go so far as to announce the person at this time.

In such circumstances, another completely unexpected major incident occurred that would ultimately cause the entire nation to be thrown into the whirlpool of revolution—this was the arrival in succession of foreign warships.

As I have repeatedly mentioned, the main text of the commercial treaty with America had been concluded between our commissioners and Harris on the 5th day of the 1st month of this year, but since imperial permission could not be obtained, the signing date of March 5th that had been previously agreed upon had to be gradually postponed. After repeated negotiations, even after Senior Councillor Hotta Bitchū-no-kami's return, Harris was invited to his residence on the 24th to explain various circumstances.

Harris initially doubted where political power in our country actually lay, and seemed ready to go to Kyoto himself if necessary, but once the circumstances gradually became clear, he no longer spoke as forcefully as before and showed signs of some moderation.

**Successive Arrivals of Foreign Warships**
However, as you know, there were disturbances that broke out in Qing China at that time. Namely, the famous Arrow Incident and the incident of French missionary killings resulted in Qing China being attacked by Britain and France, quickly leading to defeat and the conclusion of the so-called Treaty of Tientsin. Therefore, Britain and France, with the momentum of this victory,

also arrived in succession at our country, seeking to begin the trade they had long desired. Harris also already knew of these circumstances and sought to pressure us together with them. Since the general situation in East Asia was already like this, Russia naturally could not remain silent either, so Putyatin also came, claiming to be giving advance notice of British ships' arrival, and first entered Shimoda harbor.

Thus Britain, France, Russia, and America came to present a united front making demands of our country simultaneously. When matters reached this point, it became even clearer that those in authority could no longer handle the situation with their previous attitudes. Under these circumstances, debate became increasingly heated, but ultimately, according to Harris's words, Britain and France would soon approach our country with the authority gained from their new victory over Qing China, so their demands would surely be incomparable to America's.

**Shogunal Deliberations to Sign the Treaty**
However, if we could fortunately complete signing the treaty with America today, even if Britain and France came afterward making any demands, America would certainly mediate with all its power and never allow demands equal to or greater than America's to be made, thus concluding the matter. For this reason, the shogunate held various deliberations on June 19th. The great majority of shogunal councillors believed that if they stubbornly clung to old systems and disputes arose with foreign countries, the defenses of the imperial palace and coastal areas were far from adequate, so victory was quite uncertain.

In such cases, the nation's troubles would be ten times greater than today. Even looking at the imperial response, the essential point was not to defile the national polity, so in today's crisis, signing treaties without necessarily waiting for imperial permission was unavoidable. From the perspective of national grand strategy, this would actually be timely.

Only Great Elder Ii argued that this was truly a grave matter that might trigger national calamity later, so they should still petition Kyoto and request imperial orders. Junior Councillor Honda Etchū-no-kami agreed with this, but public opinion ultimately leaned toward signing the treaty, so Great Elder Ii

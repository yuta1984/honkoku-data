was issued.

Article 1: Regarding the handling of foreign ships when they drift ashore, the detailed instructions issued in Kansei 3 (year of the boar) are naturally still in effect. However, if there is any misunderstanding and we provoke trouble or act roughly from our side, this would be improper. Unless the other party commits repeated illegal acts and it becomes unavoidable, this would be an exceptional matter. First, we should use all possible strategies to detain them and report. Generally, foreign ships, even when drifting ashore, are accustomed to firing cannons toward the sea, so taking advantage of this peaceful practice and making hasty decisions from our side must be avoided. (abbreviated below)

I view this edict with great interest, because as I mentioned before, Sadanobu had already left his important position and was no longer directly involved in shogunate affairs, while Nobuaki was already thirty-five years old and in the period when his opinions carried the most weight among the senior councilors. Of course, when the letter of passage was given to the Russians at Matsumae earlier, Sadanobu was still in office and Nobuaki did not have as much influence. But regarding this edict, given the circumstances I described before, even if this was largely Nobuaki's opinion, it would not be entirely false speculation. Particularly regarding Nobuaki's approach to foreign relations, as we can glimpse from Hayashi Jussai's letters that I will introduce later, he was definitely not a reckless xenophobic exclusionist.

However, after that, Russian ships appeared in northern waters more and more frequently, and Matsumae reported to the shogunate each time. So in the 4th month of the following year - that is, Kansei 10 - the shogunate further dispatched Inspector Watanabe Kyūzō Tadashi, Envoy Ōkōchi Zenbei Masakazu, and Accounting Inspector Mitsuhashi Tōuemon Narikata to Ezo to conduct explorations, while Ishikawa Sakon-no-shōgen Tadafusa participated in this matter from Edo.

**Kondō Jūzō**

The famous Kondō Jūzō Morishige was also dispatched to Ezo territory at this time. Morishige held the position of "Matsumae Ezo Affairs Administrator" and devoted almost all his energy to this northern development project for about eight years, from that year until Bunka 5.

Thus Watanabe Tadashi, Ōkōchi Masakazu, and Mitsuhashi Narikata returned to the capital in the 11th month of that year and reported in detail the results of their investigation.

**《Small text: Hakomatsuka Secret Investigation》**

The investigations of that time were all kept strictly secret. The Ōkōchi family still possesses a document from that period called "Hakomatsuka Secret Investigation," written by a man named Nagashima Shinzaemon Tadachika, who was a shogunate construction magistrate participating in the defense of Ezo territory at that time.

**Nagashima Tadachika**

However, the key passages are covered with thick paper over the text, so one must peel off each piece of thick paper to read the content at all. This shows how much secrecy was required for these matters at the time. In exchange, this book contains very detailed information about the internal situation of that time, revealing many things not transmitted in ordinary histories. Particularly, there are often critical remarks about the actions of people like Kondō Jūzō and Mogami Tokunai, which I find quite interesting and mostly factual. The recorder seems to have written quite seriously what he observed. I don't have time to discuss all of these points here, so I will omit them. In any case, while the shogunate was conducting this secret investigation, they ultimately decided that the shogunate itself should directly manage Ezo. In the 2nd month of the following year, Kansei 11, they finally had the Matsumae family hand over the eastern Ezo territory from Urakawa to Shiretoko, along with other islands, to the shogunate as official land for the next seven years, compensating the Matsumae family with a certain amount of money.

**《Small text: The shogunate decides to develop Ezo itself》**

So the shogunate finally began direct development of Ezo under its own control. However, Mr. Ikeda Kōen's "History of the Tokugawa Shogunate Period" records that when the three men Watanabe, Ōkōchi, and Mitsuhashi returned from Ezo, they reported that the mountains and seas of that land were all rich in products and very profitable. The financially struggling shogunate then decided on direct management, with Matsudaira Nobuaki strongly supporting this, but Honda Tadakazu alone opposed it. Due to their disagreement, he eventually resigned from his position as senior councilor.

**《Small text: Circumstances of Honda Tadakazu's resignation》**

However, I think this explanation is highly questionable, because the three men Watanabe and others returned from Ezo and had an audience with the shogun on the 15th day of the 11th month of that year, but Tadakazu's resignation from senior councilor was accepted on the 26th day of the 10th month. So as a resignation caused by heated debate after the three men's report, this timing

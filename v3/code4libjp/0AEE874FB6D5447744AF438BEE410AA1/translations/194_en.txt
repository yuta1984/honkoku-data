Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Ōta Kinjō and Nobuaki) 360

...went to the capital, sought out contemporary veteran Confucian scholars, and studied under them with great reverence. The so-called Master Kien and Master Kitayama were renowned for their literary accomplishments and dominated both east and west, but when he sought instruction and asked questions, none satisfied his ultimate quest. Therefore, he resolved to seek answers from ancient masters, devoted himself to rigorous study, and made great progress in learning. The master possessed an extraordinary and proud spirit, never yielding carelessly to others. The great physician Keizan Taki was broadly learned and well-informed, his reputation shaking the Kantō region, and he was gentle and loved scholars. Many renowned men of the time studied under him, but he particularly respected our master's talent and learning, having his children receive instruction from him, often telling people: "Saisa is a true genius, the foremost among contemporary Confucians." Through this he gained renown, and our Lord Bunko of Mito also heard of his exceptional talent and intended to employ him, but someone happened to obstruct this and it did not come to pass. The master opened a private school for teaching and did not seek advancement with feudal lords, living in humble quarters as if he would remain there for life. The late senior councilor Lord Gen of Yoshida recruited him with generous offers to lecture on classical texts for his heir, the current Lord of Yoshida, treating him with exceptional favor. In the year of the Earth Rabbit (Bunka 6, 1809), when the Lord of Yoshida took his fief, the master accompanied him. In the year of the Metal Dragon (Bunka 7, 1810), he requested leave and again traveled to the capital, where court officials and scholars who heard his lectures were all amazed and impressed. At this time, Lord Kinryū of Kaga regretted that the master, though born in a northern domain, served as a guest teacher elsewhere, and repeatedly sent messengers to the Yoshida residence requesting the master's services, but the Lord of Yoshida refused. He then increased his stipend and treated him with even greater courtesy, but the Kaga lord's requests became increasingly urgent and could not be firmly refused, so he consulted with the master. The master, considering it his parents' homeland, rose and responded to the invitation. The Lord of Kaga granted him a stipend of two hundred koku, ranked him among the upper retainers, and did not burden him with official duties. Before long, Lord Kinryū passed away, and the master also died soon after. Everyone said: "The wisdom of choosing water and the benevolence of longing for one's native hill—the master possessed both." He married a woman of the Takeda family and had six sons and one daughter: Hotaka, Yūhi, Atsushi, Nyokkai, Genrei, and Tenmizu. Hotaka was called Eitarō, served Kaga with a stipend of two hundred koku, and was renowned for his excellent swordsmanship. The rest all pursued literature. Yūhi died early, Atsushi received a stipend at Yoshida, and his daughter married into the Kohitsu family. When the master first came to Edo, he was barely twenty years old, destitute and without resources, unable even to afford fuel for cooking or decent food, and moreover encountered years of famine, suffering extreme hardship, wandering in barren fields, experiencing every kind of danger and difficulty, yet his resolve became ever firmer, never yielding to poverty and humble circumstances. When he returned to Edo, he finally became a great Confucian scholar. The master was broadly learned, reading all manner of books without exception, and was particularly skilled in classical studies. In the Poetry, Documents, Changes, and Spring and Autumn Annals, he engaged in deep contemplation and repeated study, cross-referencing and synthesizing, and his skill in textual criticism often revealed what previous sages had not discovered. He devoted the most thought to how the Four Books relate to each other from beginning to end. From ancient pre-Qin texts above to miscellaneous later writings below, if anything related to the classics existed, he would cite and elaborate on all sides, examining their similarities and differences, and distinguishing right from wrong. Regarding the theories of Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties, as well as recent Qing scholars and various schools of our own country, he would gather and develop them systematically, always returning to what was most appropriate. Even with Daoist and Buddhist texts and divination theories, he roughly investigated their ultimate aims. Regarding the rise and fall of all creation, he understood everything as clearly as pointing to his palm. Concerning our imperial court, he was particularly well-versed in records from the Ōnin and Tenshō periods onward, the traces of heroic territorial divisions, the extent and size of domains, the quantity and strength of military resources, and the genealogies and names of generals and warriors, all of which he could eloquently...

...discuss, and regarding contemporary benefits and problems of provinces and counties, he also thoroughly investigated their causes, and particularly enjoyed discussing frontier affairs. However, regarding contemporary political gains and losses, he dared not discuss them carelessly, only saying: "The source of order and disorder lies solely in the ruler's extravagance or frugality." In his discussions of military training and drilling troops, he said: "While weapons that intimidate enemies are certainly found in sharp firearms, nothing surpasses swords and spears for nurturing the courage of officers and soldiers. In castle towns, those who rely exclusively on long weapons without knowing how to use short ones will inevitably become weak in their customs." Knowledgeable people considered this wise counsel. As for his poetry and prose, in his abundant talent, he initially focused on elaborate description and enjoyed ornate carving, but in his later years became simpler and more plain, yet his admirable extraordinary spirit remained consistent from beginning to end. In essence, he did not follow in others' footsteps but distinctly established his own school. After the master's death, his disciples planned how to mark his grave, all agreeing: "In our age there are no skilled writers, and among those who knew the master longest, none surpasses me." Alas, master, I have not seen you for so long. Your clear, refreshing appearance and free, untroubled spirit—I can still dimly recall glimpses of them. Your natural eloquence like a flowing river and brilliant discourse like rolling mist—now I can no longer hear them. Regarding the principles of classics and commentaries, with whom shall I resolve doubts and difficulties? Regarding ancient and contemporary affairs, with whom shall I exchange high and low discussions? Alas, the master's character was open and penetrating, not concerned with artificial decoration. Where fame existed, slander also followed. Did not the ancients say: "Those who can speak but cannot act are the nation's treasure. Those who can act but cannot speak are the nation's utility"? Why is it that the gentlemen of the world, eagerly pursuing wealth and status, knowing only personal and family flattery, do not understand that eloquent speech is a treasure? I now inscribe his grave to inform people of all ages. Written by Fujita Ichisei of Hitachi.

**Nobuaki and the Conditions of Yoshida During His Time as Lord**

As I have gradually described in the previous chapters, I believe you have generally become acquainted with the historical events concerning Nobuaki. However, as the scope of the discussion has become quite broad, I think it would be inconvenient for the matters I will discuss later if I do not repeat the previous several chapters and summarize his entire life here. Moreover, there are some points I would like to correct, so at the beginning of this chapter, I would like to trouble you for your kind attention regarding Nobuaki once more.

As I briefly mentioned before, the person called Nobuaki was born on February 10, Hōreki 13 (1763), at the Yanaka residence in Edo. Due to his father Nobuie's death on June 22, Meiwa 7 (1770), at the mere age of eight, he inherited the family headship on July 12 of that year and received his father's hereditary domain. However, in Tenmei 8...

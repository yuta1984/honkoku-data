Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Kyōgoku and Nagai-no-Tsubone) 302

**Main Text:**
...could be called the beginning of her quest for revenge. At that time, Satoya went down to Edo accompanied by a retainer of the same domain named Murase Tōma through her uncle's efforts, and Tōma further arranged for Satoya to be looked after by a swordsman named Nagai Gensuke, one of his subordinate retainers. So Satoya lived as a maid doing cooking and cleaning in this household, but since her original purpose was what it was, whenever she had free time she would go to the sword training hall and earnestly watch the matches. This eventually aroused the suspicions of her master Nagai, so one day Nagai called Satoya to his side and asked about her intentions. Satoya now had no reason to conceal anything and finally revealed her purpose to Nagai. Thereupon Nagai was deeply moved upon hearing this and finally swore to help her achieve her long-cherished goal. From then on, Nagai secretly taught Satoya martial arts, applying himself earnestly to her training, and enthusiasm is a fearsome thing - in just two years Satoya's skills improved greatly. Then one day Nagai advised Satoya to leave his household quickly and from then on devise strategies to track down her enemy Den'nai. From this point, Satoya wandered from place to place, and over the next twelve years changed masters seventy-four times, experiencing every hardship while single-mindedly striving to find her enemy. Her spirit of steadfast perseverance truly moves listeners to tears.

Now, the last place Satoya lived was in the residence of a hatamoto named Sakane Yasubē who lived in Honjo, and in that household there was a retainer named Koizumi Bun'nai. He was over fifty years old and quite fond of drink, and one evening during drunken conversation, in the stories he told, Satoya discovered hints that made her wonder if this might be her enemy Den'nai. So Satoya suppressed her pounding heart and gradually drew out more of his story, whereupon Bun'nai eventually got carried away and repeated old tales, even revealing that he was indeed that Iwabuchi Den'nai and showing her the scar from the sword that Satoya's mother had thrown at him with all her resentment. Satoya felt as if she had finally encountered the legendary udumbara flower, and the next day she immediately rushed to Nagai Gensuke and told him the whole story. Then Nagai consulted with Murase Tōma, who happened to be on duty in Edo, reported this to the authorities, immediately had Den'nai arrested and escorted to Marugame domain.

Soon after, Marugame domain formally arranged a place for the revenge duel and had the two, Den'nai and Satoya, settle their score. At this time Murase Tōma appeared as Satoya's second, but Satoya's filial devotion was concentrated, and she struck down this villain Den'nai, needing no other assistance and accomplishing her revenge magnificently. Indeed, Satoya had lost her father at age two and was separated from her mother at three, first embarking on her path of revenge at eighteen, and after seventeen years of bitter hardship finally achieved her goal. This was around Genroku 13 (1700), and the Kyōgoku family, moved by Satoya's filial devotion and steadfast endurance, elevated her to samurai status and made her attendant to their beloved daughter. Afterward, out of gratitude for her benefactor Gensuke's kindness, she took the name Nagai, and thus came to be called Nagai-no-Tsubone. This beloved daughter of the Kyōgoku family was none other than Lady Tane, who became Nobutoki's wife, and when this lady married into the Matsudaira family, Nagai-no-Tsubone also accompanied her as a personal attendant. Later, the Matsudaira family established a separate household for this Nagai-no-Tsubone, but since she naturally resided in Edo, nothing remains of her in Toyohashi, and it is regrettable that her subsequent traces are quite unclear. I myself am constantly researching her later career, and the author of "Beauties of Sanuki" has also inquired about this several times. If any of you gentlemen happen to know anything about this person, I would humbly request your instruction. However, when I consider that Nobutoki's wife Lady Kyōgoku was not an ordinary woman as I mentioned before, I somehow feel I can also see the influence of this Nagai-no-Tsubone in the other half of her character.

⦿ Matsudaira Sukenori and His Achievements

As I mentioned before, Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobutoki was appointed as Osaka Castle keeper on February 2nd of Kyōhō 14 (1729), and on the 15th of that month was transferred to Hamamatsu Castle in Tōtōmi Province. And in exchange for this, the one who was transferred from Hamamatsu to this Yoshida Castle was Matsudaira...

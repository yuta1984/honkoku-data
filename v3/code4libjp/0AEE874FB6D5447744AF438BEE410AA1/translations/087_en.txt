In any case, this is how things stood, but Hideyoshi paid no attention to these matters and pressed forward single-mindedly, arriving by 5 PM at a place called Ryūsenji, located directly northeast of Obata Castle. He first had scouts investigate the situation at Nagakute, only to learn that the battle was already over, his army had been defeated, and Ieyasu and others had already entered Obata Castle. He attempted to attack the castle immediately, but since sunset was near, it was decided to wait until the following morning.

However, Ieyasu, believing that lingering would serve no purpose, left about 200 troops there and around 8 PM secretly withdrew his forces together with Nobuo back to the Komaki fortifications. Hideyoshi was truly startled by such swift action, but there was nothing to be done about it now. He too returned to Gakuden the following day. From this point, both armies strengthened their defenses even more and resumed their confrontational posture.

This concludes the general account of the Komaki confrontation and the Battle of Nagakute. Here I would like to tell you a bit about Makino Narisato. Narisato was also known as Denzō, and was the grandson of Denzō Nobushige, son of Makino Kohaku, the builder of Toyohashi Castle whom I mentioned much earlier. As you know, Nobushige was attacked and killed by Matsudaira Kiyoyasu in Kyōroku 2 (some say it was Tenbun 1). At that time his wife was pregnant and fled to her family's home in Chita District, where she later gave birth to Denzō Shigetsugu.

However, when this man was twenty-nine years old, he got into an argument over a game of go with Ishikawa Chikugo-no-kami, lord of Morosaki Castle in Chita District, and was eventually killed. Shigetsugu's son was Narisato, who from childhood was raised by former retainers and upon reaching adulthood harbored thoughts of revenge. The enemy Chikugo-no-kami, hearing of this, told others: "I have already reached old age and have transferred headship of the house to my son Hayato-no-suke. Despite this, for Narisato to ignore the vigorous Hayato-no-suke and target this decrepit old man shows a truly cowardly spirit." When Narisato heard of these words, he decided that he must kill Hayato-no-suke as his father's enemy. In Genki 2, at a hunting ground in Miyayama, Ōno, Chita District, he finally killed him and avenged his father, though Narisato was only sixteen years old at the time.

At that time, Takigawa Kazumasu, who was at Nagashima Castle in Ise, learned of this incident and sent retainers to help him, bringing him safely...

...to Nagashima. From then on, Narisato became one of Kazumasu's close retainers and distinguished himself repeatedly in battles at Kataoka, Asaka, and Ōkawachi in Ise Province, as well as the Battle of Nagashino in Mikawa Province. When Kazumasu temporarily fell from grace, he first entered the service of Oda Nobuo.

During this Komaki campaign, he constantly served in Nobuo's army, and at the Battle of Nagakute followed behind Ieyasu's golden fan standard. The Tokugawa marquis house in Owari now possesses a pair of six-panel folding screens depicting the battles of Nagakute and Nagashino. These were created not too long after those events and are said to be well-researched, making them quite valuable as historical references. These screens also show Ieyasu's golden fan standard bursting forth from between the mountains during the Nagakute campaign, with Narisato's banner following close behind.

Later, Narisato served under Hasegawa Hideichi and during the Bunroku campaign crossed to Korea where he distinguished himself in battle. After returning to Japan, he came to serve Toyotomi Hidetsugu, but after Hidetsugu's downfall he attached himself to Ishida Mitsunari. Following the defeat at Sekigahara, he relied on Ikeda Terumasa. Through Terumasa's introduction, he finally had an audience with Ieyasu and was appointed as a close attendant to Hidetada, receiving a 3,000-koku fief in Ryōta District of Shimotsuke Province.

This is the ancestor of Makino Shigeichi, the Shizuoka Prefecture samurai I mentioned earlier. Narisato's portrait is still preserved in that gentleman's house - painted by Kanō Yasunobu, it is a most valuable historical document. There are also a drum and statue of a barbarian that Narisato brought back from Chinju in Korea during the Bunroku campaign, which are said to remain at a temple called Ryūkōin in Hada village, Ryōta District, Shimotsuke. This temple is where Narisato was buried. He died on April 23, Keichō 19, at age fifty-nine. He had four sons: Shigenobu, Shigeyori, Shigesumi, and Shigetsune, with the family headship passing to the third son, Shigesumi.

However, out of duty to his elder brother Shigenobu, Shigesumi never married and specifically adopted Shigenobu's son Shigekatsu as his heir. Shigetsune also never married and likewise adopted Shigenobu's second son Shigetaka as his son. Shigenobu later entered the priesthood and traveled throughout the provinces, for a time living in quiet retirement in Higashiyama, Kyoto, calling himself Fūshaken. The refined elegance of his hermit's life came to the attention of Emperor Go-Mizunoo, who after his own retirement bent his imperial palanquin to honor him with an imperial viewing.

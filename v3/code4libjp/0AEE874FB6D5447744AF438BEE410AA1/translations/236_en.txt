*Subheading: The Entanglement of Foreign Affairs and Domestic Administration*

Now, due to the circumstances described in the previous chapter, relations between the shogunate and foreign countries gradually developed, but these foreign policy issues naturally brought about serious changes to domestic politics as well. From this point forward, domestic administration and foreign affairs became mutually intertwined in complex ways, reaching an unmanageable situation.

As I have repeatedly mentioned, the Tokugawa firmly established their isolationist policy after the Kan'ei era. Originally, the behavior of foreigners toward our country was extremely disagreeable and often made it seem as if they harbored malicious intentions toward us. Their many unlawful and violent actions considerably heightened our people's feelings of disgust toward them. Given such circumstances, I believe it was unavoidable that the Tokugawa shogunate sought to establish an isolationist, anti-foreign policy for our country's self-defense.

However, the influence of Chinese learning at that time was also considerable, instilling extreme pride in our people, which must be said to have played a significant role. As a result, not only various foreign countries but even China came to be despised as barbarian nations.

Particularly from the medieval period onward, archaic scholarly trends like those of the Mito school and Motoori Norinaga's group gradually emerged, leading to the development of historical studies and the revival of ancient learning, which increasingly awakened our people's self-consciousness. This was no trivial matter, ultimately becoming a source of reverence for the emperor on one hand, while on the other hand combining with the long-established spirit of honoring the domestic while despising the foreign to produce a kind of narrow patriotism - an indisputable fact, I believe.

This anti-foreign sentiment, combined with this particular form of patriotism among our people, was naturally instilled in the people's minds through government policies, school lectures, or family education, becoming what might be called national sentiment that gradually reached this end of the shogunate period. Therefore, as you know, even when some knowledgeable individuals like Dutch scholars who understood overseas conditions emerged to sound warnings, by this point they encountered the fate of being almost unable to accept such ideas, having become so distant from world knowledge.

Regarding this point, figures like Mito's Nariaki were rather enlightened individuals who had long advocated coastal defense theories and were particularly revered by their contemporaries as reformers of the age. However, unfortunately, they could not transcend the current of isolationist, anti-foreign principles, seeking to maintain consistency with these throughout, ultimately falling into narrow-minded views and causing great conflicts with those advocating opening the country.

Needless to say, even the shogunate authorities initially sought to implement this anti-foreign policy, showing no difference from others in this regard. However, when they actually tried to implement it and took charge of the matter, it not only failed to proceed as they had initially expected, but as they gradually came to understand foreign circumstances, they realized they could never prevail against world trends. I believe this is why differences of opinion gradually emerged between those in authority and those outside it.

Particularly, relying on our country's hardly dependable military preparations while facing financial difficulties that made even tomorrow uncertain, there was truly no alternative. No matter who might have taken their place in handling the situation, they would ultimately have had to resort to retreating diplomacy - this was truly an unavoidable circumstance.

However, general public opinion could not possibly accommodate this, for the reasons mentioned above. The anti-foreign sentiment that had been entrenched for many years increasingly provoked antagonism toward foreign countries, generally regarding the actions of government officials as cowardly behavior in yielding to foreign pressure.

Given such circumstances, the treaties with America, Britain, and Russia concluded by the shogunate in Ansei 1 and 2, which I outlined in the previous chapter, were not easily accepted by the general trend of the realm. Particularly since the shogunate had gathered various daimyo in Edo Castle before Perry's return and announced principles that supposedly reflected their true intentions, public opinion could hardly accept this. Among them, figures like Mito's Nariaki represented the main advocates of a hard line against foreign countries, and at that time he himself participated in shogunal government...

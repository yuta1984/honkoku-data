There, Sadamitsu defended the castle firmly together with Saigo Masakatsu's son, Magoshichiro Motomasa, but when the enemy sought peace, since they were vastly outnumbered, they finally agreed to these terms, surrendered the castle, and withdrew together with Motomasa to where Masakatsu was. However, Shigezane further attacked Suganuma Sadanao at Shinshiro. Since Sadanao was based at Damine at the time, there must have been a castle deputy at Shinshiro, but because Suganuma Iga-no-kami Sadakatsu and others fought valiantly, Shigezane was eventually forced to withdraw his army.

Afterwards, Sadamitsu built a fortress at Takashiro in Saigo, while Masakatsu established his residence at a place called Doyama in the same Yana District. The Imagawa forces had Makino Dewa-no-kami Yasunari and Makino Shinjiro Sadanari from Ushikubo lead the vanguard to attack them, so there was no respite from warfare.

Later, Masakatsu built additional castles at places called Gohonmatsu in Nakayama (Yana District) and Tsukino-ya in Suse-yama. He stationed himself at Gohonmatsu while having his son Motomasa reside at Tsukino-ya. However, on September 26th of that year, the Imagawa general Asahina Kii-no-kami Yasunaga arrived and attacked this newly constructed Gohonmatsu castle of the Saigo clan. Both Masakatsu and Motomasa died in battle, causing Tsukino-ya castle to fall naturally as well. However, on June 2nd of the following year, Eiroku 5, Suganuma Sadamitsu launched a night attack on Noda castle, drove out the Imagawa forces, and reestablished his base there. The Imagawa side attacked again, but this time they could not possibly capture it.

According to the Shinshiro Kikigaki, the attack on Shinshiro occurred at this time, and it records that the Suganuma clan of Shinshiro and Damine had made overtures to the Takeda clan. However, I find this theory difficult to believe. In any case, this region was in extreme turmoil at that time, so the confusion of historical facts goes without saying, and consequently the differences in dates vary according to different records, which is what troubles researchers most.

Under such circumstances, Ieyasu repeatedly advanced troops into eastern Mikawa. He attacked Ushikubo on April 11th of Eiroku 4, captured Toyone castle at Nagasawa in the eighth month, and fought a battle at Ushikubohara on the last day of the tenth month. In the second month of the same fifth year, he attacked Udono Totaro Nagateru of Kamigo Village in Hoi District, captured the castle, and Nagateru died in battle, but his two sons were taken alive by the Tokugawa forces. This Nagateru

...was the son of Nagamochi. The Mikawa Monogatari states that it was Nagamochi who died in battle at this time, but the Matsudaira Chronicles and other sources record that it was Totaro and his younger brother who were captured. However, I believe what I stated earlier is the truth.

At that time, Ieyasu's eldest son Nobuyasu was still called Takechiyo and was in Suruga with his mother from the Sekiguchi clan, creating a truly perilous situation. Through Ishikawa Kazumasa's arrangements, they persuaded Imagawa Ujizane to exchange these two sons of Udono for Nobuyasu, enabling Nobuyasu to return to his homeland for the first time, with the Sekiguchi lady also coming to Mikawa before long.

From this point, Ieyasu increasingly deployed troops to eastern Mikawa. According to commendation letters from Ujizane preserved by the Nagaoka Makino family and Tanabe Makino family, there were battles between Tokugawa and Imagawa forces at Tominaga on May 7th of Eiroku 5, at Hachiman on September 29th of the same year, at Otsuka from the night of September 22nd to the 23rd, and at Ushikubo in the fourth month of the sixth year.

Given this situation, the Imagawa side built new fortifications at Sawaki Hachiman, while the Tokugawa side also constructed a fortress at Ichinomiya and had Honda Hyakusuke Nobutoshi defend it. The famous story of Ieyasu's reinforcement of Ichinomiya also occurred around this time, appearing to have been in June of Eiroku 5 according to the Matsudaira Chronicles, and this tale is also recorded in the Mikawa Monogatari.

Ujizane led over ten thousand horsemen and encamped at Ushikubo, while Ichinomiya had only five to six hundred men and was in truly desperate straits. Ieyasu personally led about three thousand of his own troops, passed through the enemy lines at Hachiman Sawaki, and reinforced Ichinomiya. However, at this time his senior retainers earnestly warned him of the danger. Yet Ieyasu said: "Having stationed retainers to guard enemy territory, to hear that enemies are approaching and not rescue them would show neither loyalty nor righteousness. Should I fail in the reinforcement and die in battle, that too would be Heaven's will. Whether the enemy has a large army or small forces is not the issue." He paid no heed to their warnings. This has been handed down to posterity as a tale of virtue regarding the importance of loyalty and righteousness.

According to the Ushikubo Secret Discussion Records, on March 6th of the following sixth year, there was another battle at Ushikubohara, with Ieyasu personally leading over fifteen hundred horsemen in the attack. At that time, Makino Shinjiro was called Minbu-no-jo Shigetsugu, but since he had already inclined his heart toward the Tokugawa side, he claimed illness and did not participate in this battle, while his son...

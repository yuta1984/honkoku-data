Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Imperial Restoration and Yoshida Domain) 592

First, I have extracted and listed both ends of the origins and sources of the aforementioned public discussions and the fundamental aspects of maintaining the middle path, explaining them at length. Therefore, next I shall address the merits and demerits of the three strategies as follows:

Regarding the merits and demerits of the three strategies and the advantages and disadvantages of the Kantō selection from beginning to end (The draft of this section is completed, but due to time constraints for revisions and the approaching deadline for submission, I regretfully stopped writing on the night of the ninth day)

Based on the above memorial, Kansō's opinions can be generally understood, but in a word, this memorial represents completely extreme imperial loyalist and anti-foreign ideology. Particularly in its tone and in its veneration of Nariaki, it is almost entirely in the style of Mito school arguments. This is believed to result from Kansō having once been personally instructed by Fujita Tōkō.

Soon after, Yoshida Domain was appointed as Osaka Castle custodian and proceeded to that posting. Even during his residence there, opinions were frequently sought from domain retainers. At that time, a memorial submitted by someone to domain lord Nobuhisa is truly interesting. From today's perspective, it is merely an amusing tale, but it cannot be dismissed as it provides insight into the popular sentiment of that era. Therefore, I shall include the full text, though it is somewhat unsatisfying that the author's name is unknown.

1. Observing the current state of the realm, the danger is like stacked eggs, and with great trepidation, I believe this represents the final fate of the Kantō region. In recent years, various daimyo of western provinces have gone to Kyoto and secretly made plans, a situation that is extremely serious. Considering deeply what will happen when the Shogun goes to Kyoto in the second month of next year's spring, this is truly not a time when one can rest easy day or night. At present, even the governing officials have no viable options. I observe this to be a matter of great concern. Recently in Kyoto, masterless warriors from western provinces have frequently engaged in violent and lawless behavior. Even the Kyoto deputy cannot suppress them, apparently leaving the situation unaddressed, and the deputy's inability to maintain proper order is truly lamentable. The Kyoto deputy is really only a deputy in name, unable to fulfill the deputy's duties.

Now Your Lordship serves as Osaka Castle custodian. The castle custodian serves as the western provinces' military governor, truly holding responsibility for the entire realm. Though your position is below the senior councilors, in terms of function it is equivalent to the Shogun's authority, like the ancient Chinzei-fu and Dazai-fu posts. All these are positions for nobility. The Chinzei-fu and Daza-

i-fu had defensive personnel, but the Osaka castle custodian is governor in name only, with neither defensive preparations nor territorial jurisdiction. Should troubles arise, neither suppression nor castle defense would be possible. Thus the castle custodian would be merely nominal, the same as the Kyoto deputy. In normal times, controlling the western provinces might be possible, but should disturbances occur in Kyoto, they would certainly attack this castle as well. The defensive preparations for such an occasion would be no simple matter.

Should a major crisis occur in Kyoto while Your Lordship holds this position, what would you do? You have not an inch of territory nor defensive personnel. When it comes to that point, there would certainly be no reinforcements. At that time, it is impossible to predict how many within the castle might raise objections. The lords of Amagasaki and Kishiwada would be unlikely to rescue Osaka, and would certainly wait for an opportunity while taking both sides. Even if Your Lordship defended the isolated castle alone, maintaining the defense for long would be extremely difficult. You might be compelled to die honorably. Even if you died honorably, while it might earn you a fine reputation, there would likely be those who would call it poor strategy. Therefore, Your Lordship should, before these buds have sprouted, report to Kantō that this great castle is difficult to defend, retire from office, withdraw to your home domain of Yoshida, and focus on enriching the country and strengthening the military.

Reduce the tax burden on farmers, clarify rewards and punishments, develop barren lands, have idle people engage in farming, raise farmer-soldiers, and train in military arts - naturally the military will become strong. Drive out corrupt merchants and practice benevolent government, and the people of neighboring provinces will be drawn to your virtue. Recently, farmers of Hamamatsu, Okazaki, and other neighboring provinces have suffered from harsh government and many secretly resent their local lords. This is entirely due to financial difficulties and the improper attitudes of officials. Given such conditions in neighboring provinces, if Your Lordship were to enter your domain and govern with benevolent compassion, the neighboring provinces would look up to Yoshida. Should this come to pass, in times of crisis, not only the neighboring provinces but from Hakone mountains in the east to the borders of Owari in the west could be taken without bloodshed.

Owari is a weak and indolent province, but I understand that the former Great Counselor is renowned for his wisdom and may enter his domain soon. If this lord also enters his domain, I believe not only the neighboring areas but all of Suruga and Tōtōmi would fall under Owari's banner. Should this happen, it would be most regrettable, so Your Lordship should not miss this opportunity for even a moment

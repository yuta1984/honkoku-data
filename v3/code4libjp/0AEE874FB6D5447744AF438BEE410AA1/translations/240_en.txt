They gradually infiltrated step by step, and once one objective was achieved, they would bring forward negotiations for another in this manner. By Ansei 4, Dutch warnings had become increasingly frequent, and the shogunate came to realize various things, eventually acknowledging that commercial trade was unavoidable in order to keep pace with world progress.

*Subheading: Conclusion of Additional Treaties with Holland and Russia*
On August 29th of that year, they first concluded a forty-article additional treaty with Holland at Nagasaki, and on September 7th of the same year, also at Nagasaki, they concluded a twenty-seven-article additional treaty with Russia. These additional treaties were soon abandoned, but they were intended by the shogunate at the time to serve as the foundation for commercial treaties with various nations, and were matters that officials of that period studied extensively.

Now, regarding the aforementioned American Consul General Harris, his subsequent demands became increasingly sharp and aggressive.

*Subheading: Harris's Demands*
After completing his official visit to Edo Castle in October of Ansei 4, on October 26th he met with Bitchu-no-kami at the residence of Senior Councilor Hotta, requesting permission for foreign envoys to reside in the capital and for free trade. He stated that this was not merely America's demand alone, but truly a necessity equally required by all nations given the world situation, and he spent thousands of words repeatedly discussing European circumstances and current world trends.

The shogunate felt it necessary to take some action in response, so they first selected the capable Shimoda magistrate Inoue Shinano-no-kami and inspector Iwase Higo-no-kami (Iga-no-kami) to handle these negotiations. On December 2nd of that year, Bitchu-no-kami again met with Harris at his own residence.

*Subheading: Negotiations at the Institute for the Investigation of Barbarian Books*
From the 11th, both negotiators held thirteen rounds of meetings at the Institute for the Investigation of Barbarian Books until January 12th of the following year, Ansei 5. The hardships these negotiators endured at this time were truly beyond what we can imagine today. If I were to explain in detail, it would require considerable time, but ultimately what was decided in the thirteenth meeting were: 1) matters regarding the residence and travel of American officials, 2) locations for opening ports and markets, 3) trade methods and restrictions on commodities, 4) currency exchange matters, 5) consular

6) matters regarding judicial rights, 6) regulations for foreigners' walks, and several other important issues were also decided. However, the results of these negotiations were clearly incompatible with the national sentiment of the time, as mentioned earlier, leading to even greater domestic political complications. I believe it is essential to discuss this situation here in some detail.

As mentioned earlier, while the shogunate gradually came to understand world trends, Harris's demands were also extremely intense. In response, they appointed negotiators to advance talks on one hand, while on the other they believed it necessary to somehow unify domestic public opinion by ascertaining the views of the feudal lords.

*Subheading: Opinions of the Feudal Lords*
On November 12th of Ansei 4, starting with the three branch families and including those stationed in Edo from the waiting room, main corridor, and great hall groups, they distributed written records of Harris's main points and instructed them to avoid impractical empty theories that could not be implemented, and to carefully study the matter from the perspective of those actually responsible for handling the situation before submitting recommendations on its feasibility. On the 15th, they issued similar instructions to all feudal lords during their regular castle attendance.

However, the most vehemently opposed was the familiar Mito's Nariaki, who on the 15th submitted a lengthy written argument to Senior Councilor Hotta. This argument was extremely radical and inflammatory. While it undoubtedly overflowed with patriotic sentiment, it employed reasoning that could not escape criticism for being reckless and extreme, giving the impression that it might not even be entirely serious. Consequently, the senior councilors, upon seeing this, seemed almost at a loss for words, and some privately commented that it was not advisable for Nariaki. Some of Mito's senior retainers became fearful toward the shogunate and petitioned to withdraw this proposal, requesting that it be struck from the record.

Since I'm on the topic, I'd like to briefly mention that famous senior retainer of Mito...

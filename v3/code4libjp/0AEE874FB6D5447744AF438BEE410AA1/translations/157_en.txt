**Main Text:**
1. Regardless of the matter, all officials must conduct joint investigations and then report to the senior retainers to request instructions. When officials merely wait for orders from above without conducting proper inquiries, it is as if there are no officials below. Officials must not neglect preliminary internal investigations.

Note: Even if officials themselves, as well as their wives and children, receive correspondence and gifts from their subordinate groups and organizations, they must not accept anything if the reasons are not proper. Of course, subordinate groups should not engage in such practices either. Both those who receive and those who give shall be equally at fault. Even if this becomes known later, strict punishment shall be applied. Lower officials must be firmly instructed in this matter, and all affairs must be conducted without personal interest. After leadership changes, if it is learned that lower officials and group leaders engaged in private matters previously, after investigation over months and years, former officials shall be punished just as severely as current leaders.

1. Not only castle guards but also officials at various gates, checkpoints, and guard posts must maintain strict security to prevent suspicious persons from entering or leaving. This must be firmly communicated to all groups and supervisory units.

1. Each person according to their status should maintain appropriate retainers, diligently practice archery and horsemanship, maintain and repair military equipment, and practice frugality in all matters. If anyone fails to observe this, inspectors shall offer advice. If they still do not comply, waste money, and become unable to perform their duties, they shall be strictly dealt with.

Note: When replacing horses, those who delay acquiring replacement horses without good reason shall be at fault. Also, residences should be appropriately maintained, and those without proper housing must construct it immediately as prescribed.

1. Starting with the warrior households, pay careful attention to fire prevention in towns and villages, and ensure there is no gambling or wagering among the lower classes. If such activities occur among the lower classes, their supervisors, group leaders, masters of retainers, and prominent figures in towns and villages shall be at fault and must be strictly punished. In case of fires, earthquakes, severe storms, or civil disturbances, gather at designated locations and maintain vigilant defense.

1. Not only on New Year's Day but also during seasonal festivals, monthly observances, and when receiving announcements of auspicious or inauspicious events in Edo, understand the special instructions, gather at the second castle compound, and pay respects to the senior retainers. All should show proper courtesy to high-ranking officials. Moreover, even within the domain, sending wives [continues...]

...and children to distant places without proper notification to supervisory authorities is prohibited. Or if one indulges in fishing and hunting, wandering around various places without attendants and going to dangerous places resulting in injury, this shall be considered a fault. If death occurs, succession rights shall not be granted. Moreover, meeting with dissolute persons at post stations and tea houses for entertainment is strictly forbidden. If incidents occur at such places, both reason and action shall be considered wrong.

1. Regarding religious sects, temples and shrines in newly developed areas, and various firearms, these are matters subject to government inspection. Religious matters must be handled with great care to avoid any suspicion. Except for the precincts of temples and shrines that have existed since ancient times, no construction of even minor halls or shrines should be permitted. Hermitages should also be thoroughly investigated to ensure they do not masquerade as historical sites. Annual firearm registration records for towns and villages must be verified for accuracy, and except for hunters, the firing of firearms for killing animals is strictly prohibited.

1. Regarding construction and repairs at various locations, it is not necessary to strictly adhere to previous regulations regarding priorities. Even if repairs use bamboo, wood, tiles, or stone materials, this is acceptable depending on the circumstances. After proper consideration, follow current best practices without need for approval, ensuring no deterioration occurs. However, castle construction may be subject to government prohibitions depending on the type, so approval must be obtained according to the specific circumstances.

1. Regularly instruct that towns, villages, post stations, and markets should not be disorderly. Do not allow dissolute persons to remain, inspect commercial goods to eliminate unnecessary items, and ensure prices are not excessive. Pay attention to road cleaning, promptly replace dead or fallen roadside trees, ensure bridge crossings are convenient, and so that everyone from government officials to ordinary travelers can travel with their horses without delay, that inns follow prescribed rates, that travelers face no inconveniences, and that warrior households can obtain needed supplies without difficulty - all relevant officials must apply themselves diligently to these matters.

1. Even permanently barren land will naturally return to productivity over time - this is evident. Not only should such land be considered, but new rice fields and dry fields should be quickly established. Construction of embankments, rivers, marshes, and reservoirs should be carried out robustly without interfering with farming seasons and without carelessly deploying excessive labor.

Note: Consider the gains and losses of mountain forestry, whether planting or harvesting, without negligence.

1. Regarding tribute taxes, constantly consider tax exemption matters, correcting excesses and deficiencies in both old and new fields, and handle crop inspections fairly. When collections are substantial...

**Toyohashi City Historical Discourse** (The Transfer of Matsudaira Tadatoshi) 210

**Main Text**
quite interesting, so I will present the full text below:

"Agreement for pack horse charges between Goyu and Akasaka towns: When going up [to Kyoto], Akasaka horses shall come to Goyu and accompany [travelers] to Fujikawa. When going down [from Kyoto], Goyu horses shall come to Akasaka and accompany [travelers] to Yoshida. As ordered by the government office that travelers on the highway should not borrow pack horses [at random], it is thus arranged. The above.
Genna 9, Year of the Boar
May 29th
Goyu Town
Akasaka Town
Village Headmen"

The appearance of "village headmen" (shōya) in the above is quite noteworthy, as I believe the term "shōya" cannot be found much earlier than this period.

**Change of Era to Kan'ei** The era name Genna lasted until the 9th year and then changed to Kan'ei, which marked the beginning of the reign of the third Shogun Iemitsu. The lord of Yoshida Castle, Tadatoshi, died of illness on May 5th of Kan'ei 9.

**Tadatoshi's Death** Afterwards, on August 11th of the same year, his son Tadafusa succeeded him, but was simultaneously transferred to Kariya, so this Fukōzu branch of the Matsudaira clan also left Yoshida after only about twenty-one years of residence.

**Son Tadafusa Inherits and is Transferred to Kariya** The brief biography of this Tadatoshi is recorded in the "Tokugawa Jikki" under the entry for August 11th, Kan'ei 9, which I think is quite concise, so I will excerpt it here as well.

**Record from Tokugawa Jikki** "11th day: When Matsudaira Tonomonokami Tadatoshi, lord of Yoshida Castle in Mikawa Province, died, his son Gorōhachi Tadafusa inherited the estate of 30,000 koku, was transferred from Yoshida, and made lord of Kariya Castle in the same province. This Tadatoshi was the son of Tonomonokami Ietada, who died in battle at Fushimi Castle during the Kōshi Rebellion. In the first year of Keichō, he came of age in the presence of Taitokuin-dono

**Main Text**
[Lord], received one character from his name, and was called Tadatoshi, later changing it to Tadatoshi. When his father died in battle, he was still called Hachirō, followed the eastern campaign, and defended Komigawa Castle. In February of the following year, Keichō 6, he received Fukōzu and returned to the hereditary lands of his ancestors, ruling 10,000 koku. On June 22nd of the 9th year he was ennobled and called Tonomonokami. On November 12th of the 17th year he received the present castle with additional favor, making it 30,000 koku. In the 19th year he participated in the Osaka campaign and defended Amagasaki Castle. In the first year of Genna, during the Osaka campaign, he accompanied Lord Yorinobu and went to battle. In the 7th year he served in the retinue for the imperial consort's entry into the palace, followed the journey to the capital that year, and when returning, on the 14th day of intercalary 8th month, [the Shogun] arrived at his castle of Yoshida, and Tadatoshi presented a wakizashi by Kunitsugu, dying at the age of 51 in this year."

In the above passage, "followed the journey to the capital that year" must refer to Genna 9. The daughter of Shogun Hidetada entered the palace as imperial consort in Genna 7, and Tadatoshi certainly accompanied her as part of the retinue at that time.

**Hidetada's Return East, Passing Through Yoshida** However, Hidetada's journey to the capital was in Genna 9, as I mentioned earlier, and Tadatoshi accompanied him on this occasion as well. When Hidetada returned east, he stopped at Yoshida Castle on the 14th day of intercalary 8th month, and Tadatoshi appears to have presented him with a sword by Kunitsugu. Since there was an intercalary 8th month in Genna 9 but no intercalary 8th month in Genna 7, this event must have occurred in Genna 9. While the reference to "that year" in the Tokugawa Jikki seems to suggest it was Genna 7 based on the preceding text, I believe the facts show this was not the case.

**Heishin Kikō** Next, I would like to discuss the conditions of this area during the time when Tadatoshi was lord of Yoshida Castle. First, in Hayashi Dōshun's "Heishin Kikō" from Genna 2, it states:

"Yoshida: Between Edo and Kyoto there are four great bridges - Rokugō in Musashi, Yoshida and Yahagi in Mikawa, and Seta in Ōmi. Only Yahagi is an earthen bridge, so it sometimes gets washed away by floods. Has it recently been made into a plank bridge?"

**The Great Bridge of Yoshida** This is what is written. Of course, at that time all the great rivers along the Tōkaidō were crossed by ferry, and there were no bridges,

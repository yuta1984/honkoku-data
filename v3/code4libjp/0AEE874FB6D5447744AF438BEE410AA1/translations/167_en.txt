Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (The Ōkōchi Clan Returns to Yoshida) 306

**Main Text:**
As I mentioned before, Sukenori made considerable efforts, but since the fundamental nature of politics was different from today, the development of urban areas was in a completely hopeless situation. When we compare this with today's situation where villages naturally decline and farmers gather only in cities—a matter requiring great study—what feelings do you gentlemen experience? I think that research into the causes of this would be an excellent topic especially for those who concern themselves with municipal administration.

In addition, during Sukenori's era there were major bridge construction projects in Kyōhō 17 (1732) and Genbun 5 (1740), and the Suijin Shrine at Shimoji was built in November of Genbun 3 (1738). Sukenori also frequently undertook construction of temples and shrines within his domain, beginning with Akaiwa Temple, and the stone torii gate at Yoshida Shrine was indeed built by this man. I would also like to introduce one more thing: from this period there are maps of the Enoki riverbank from Kyōhō 19 (1734), drawings of individual houses in Funa-machi from March of Genbun 5 (1740), and plans of the area around the ship warehouse recorded by the town headman Asai Yojizaemon, all of which are still preserved in warehouses in Funa-machi. I believe all of these serve as valuable references as part of the city's history.

Also, in Kyōhō 15 (1730), there was a filial son named Magoichi in Uo-machi, and Sukenori rewarded him with two bales of rice and publicly honored him. I think this too should be recorded here.

⦿The Ōkōchi Clan Returns to Yoshida

As described above, Matsudaira Sukenori, who was lord of Yoshida Castle, was appointed as Kyoto deputy on October 15th of Kan'en 2 (1749) and simultaneously transferred to Hamamatsu Castle in Tōtōmi Province. In exchange, Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobunao was transferred from Hamamatsu Castle to this Yoshida. This Nobunao was, as I mentioned before, the eldest son of Izu-no-kami Nobutoki, who had been lord of Yoshida Castle before Sukenori. Nobutoki was appointed as Osaka Castle deputy on February 2nd of Kyōhō 14 (1729) and simultaneously transferred to Hamamatsu Castle in exchange with Sukenori, dying on April 19th of Enkyō 1 (1744) at age...

...sixty-two. Nobunao was twenty-six at the time and inherited the family headship, receiving his father's entire legacy of seventy thousand koku on June 4th of the same year and becoming lord of Hamamatsu Castle. Now, in October of Kan'en 2 (1749), he was again exchanged with Sukenori and became lord of this Yoshida Castle. At that time, as you roughly know from the previous chapter, the Tokugawa Shogun was the ninth generation Ieshige, and it was just when Sakai Uta-no-kami Tadayasu, the senior councilor, retired and Hotta Sagami-no-kami Masasuke became senior councilor. Of course, at that time the eighth Shogun Yoshimune was still retired in the Western Compound and called Ōgosho, but as you know, he died on June 20th of Kan'en 4, that is, Hōreki 1 (1751).

Originally, the ninth Shogun Ieshige was by nature weak and irritable, with extremely poor personal conduct, and moreover his speech was extremely unclear, so when the senior councilors needed to receive his opinions, they had to have the chamberlain Ōoka Tadamitsu interpret everything. This Tadamitsu alone was able to understand Ieshige's speech, so the senior councilors and others constantly gave gifts to Tadamitsu and earnestly sought his mediation. Because of this situation, the government gradually fell into disorder, and especially after dismissing Matsudaira Norimura, who was a capable figure of the time, from the senior council, even the shogunal administration that the previous generation's Yoshimune had worked so hard to revitalize became increasingly chaotic.

However, contrary to this, at the same time there was a great flourishing of learning, which seems truly strange, but this learning actually formed the source of loyalist thought. Indeed, the well-known Takeuchi Shikibu proclaimed the theory of imperial restoration openly in Kyoto around this time, and it was also then that Yamagata Daini wrote the "Ryūshi Shinron" and greatly discussed contemporary problems. Thus loyalist advocates appeared in both east and west, but among them the rise of National Learning was particularly noteworthy. Kada Arimitsu, the adopted son of the famous Kada Azumamaro, went to Edo and lectured on National Learning to the Shogun's brother Tayasu Munetake, and through his recommendation, disciples of Kamo Mabuchi such as talented men like Murata Harumi and Katō Chikage, and great figures like Motoori Norinaga emerged—perhaps this should be seen as a reflection of the times. In any case, if these matters ultimately became distant causes of the Meiji Restoration, I believe there is something truly indescribable about it. First...

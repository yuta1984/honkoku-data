to the rear boundary, inspection was conducted and recorded on the drawings.

Item: Regarding town drainage, the eastern [drainage] converges in front of Ryūten-ji Temple, and the end flows into rice fields.

Item: The western waterway converges behind Daiku-machi, and the end flows into Denjirō's field in Shinsen-machi. However, since that field has recently been converted to dry fields, during heavy rains the water cannot be properly drained to the roadway, causing hardship for the towns. When we reported this to the magistrate, officials came to inspect, and of the aforementioned fields, a strip 44 ken long and 1 ken wide, totaling 1 tan 24 bu (of which 10 bu belonged to Jinbei of Hada village), had its annual tax permanently reduced from Genroku 6, year of the rooster [1693], and was granted for waterway drainage purposes.

Item: Each year during waterway cleaning, we report to the magistrate, and officials from the group come to inspect and oversee. Workers are provided by the towns shown on the drawings according to the water flow for cleaning.

Genroku 6, year of the rooster, 8th month [August 1693]

Regarding town waterway drainage, in previous years we petitioned during Lord Ogasawara Sado-no-kami's time, and drainage was reformed according to the drawings, with water flowing well into the hie fields within Hada village territory. However, subsequently the hie fields were filled in and became dry fields, causing water flow problems and backing up water behind the towns, creating difficulties. Therefore, we petitioned this time, and after inspection by Sudō Buntayū, an official of Lord Makino Daigaku, in the 9th month of Hōei 5, year of the rat [September 1708], 92 ken of hie fields owned by Jinbei of Hada village and 17 ken of dry fields owned by Zen'emon of the same village - totaling 109 ken with 6 shaku width - were designated as waterway. The taxable area was permanently reduced, and we were ordered to plant aoki trees along the permanent embankments for the waterway construction, for which we are most grateful. Therefore, the waterway drawings have now been revised and updated.

Hōei 5, year of the rat, 28th day of the 9th month [October 28, 1708]

Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Matsudaira Nobutoki and His Era) 274

**Main Text:**
from the Kishū house and inherited the main family line. He was quite an outstanding ruler who particularly advocated for warrior house principles, so his policies naturally opposed the court-warrior harmony doctrine that had prevailed since Tsunayoshi's time. Therefore, he generally disapproved of the plans that Arai Hakuseki and others had made in the previous era. Consequently, immediately upon taking office, he dismissed both Hakuseki and Norikatus, and Hayashi Nobuatsu came to be employed again. However, Kuze Shigeyuki, whom I mentioned earlier, stood between these changes and continued in office until his death on June 27, Kyōhō 5, making considerable contributions to the Kyōhō administration. For reference, I should mention that the Shōtoku era name was changed to Kyōhō in its sixth year. This Kyōhō period was when Yoshimune actively reformed the shogunal administration, and I think Yoshimune can truly be called the second founder of the Tokugawa house. In Kyōhō 4, 4th month, Nobutoki changed his original name from Nobutaka to his current name, and at this time too, Hayashi Nobuatsu calculated the name selection. Then on the 2nd day of the 2nd month of the 14th year, Nobutoki was appointed as Osaka castle keeper, and at the same time was transferred to Hamamatsu in Tōtōmi province, while Matsudaira Bungo-no-kami Sukekuni, the lord of that castle, came to replace him as lord of Yoshida Castle.

Now, for convenience, I would like to continue discussing Nobutoki's affairs and mention a few more things here. First, regarding when Nobutoki became Osaka castle keeper and took up his post. Detailed diaries from that period also remain in the Ōkōchi family. Everything from his departure from Edo, his stop at Yoshida, and his arrival in Osaka is recorded in great and small detail, providing considerable historical material. However, on July 11 of the following year, Nobutoki was promoted to senior councilor together with Matsudaira Ukyō-dayū Terusada of a branch family, and there must have been some circumstances behind this. As I mentioned before, this Terusada was Teretsuna's son and Nobuteru's younger brother, so he was Nobutoki's uncle. This person was very intimate with that Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu and gained great trust from the fifth shogun Tsunayoshi, receiving increases from 32,000 to 72,000 koku and becoming lord of Takasaki Castle in Jōshū. But when Yoshiyasu was dismissed, Terusada...

was also shunned by the shogunate and was once transferred to Murakami in Echigo. However, in this main family house of Nobutoki as well, they had intimate relations with the Yanagisawa family at that time, as I believe was roughly understood when I introduced Teretsuna's wife's letter earlier. So I always harbor some suspicion about the retirement of Nobutoki's father Nobuteru, but since this Nobuteru appears to have been sickly, it might have been entirely due to illness. However, his retirement coincidentally occurred when the sixth shogun Ienobu took office, exactly when Yoshiyasu, Terusada and others were being dismissed, so there seems to be some meaning there, and if one suspects it, it becomes quite suspicious. But when the eighth shogun Yoshimune finally took office, the situation suddenly changed, and the fact that this uncle and nephew were promoted to senior councilor on the same day must have greatly surprised people at the time. There is a theory that when Yoshimune was still a bastard son of the Kishū family with only the small stipend of 30,000 koku in Echizen Nyū, Terusada earnestly conveyed his sincere intentions that since that land was at a border corner, village exchanges should be arranged in due course. Also, from his position as personal attendant to the shogun, during audiences with Shogun Tsunayoshi, he made efforts to provide convenience to Yoshimune and interceded for him, so Yoshimune was deeply pleased and first restored Terusada to Takasaki Castle, and now promoted him to senior councilor as a reward. In any case, Terusada's appointment certainly caused great surprise among people at the time. From then on, Nobutoki participated in shogunal administration together with Terusada, continuing service during Yoshimune's tenure through Kyōhō, Genbun, Kanpō, and Enkyō eras, and died on April 18, Enkyō 1. Many records from his time in office still remain with the Ōkōchi family today, and many are valuable for studying the so-called Kyōhō administration.

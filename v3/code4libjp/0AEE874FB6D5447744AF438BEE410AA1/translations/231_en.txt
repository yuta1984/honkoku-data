Nevertheless, skillfully avoiding searches by ships of both nations [Britain and France], [Putiatin] again arrived at Ajikawa off Osaka on September 18th of Ansei 1. The Osaka castle keeper and others were greatly troubled by this, but finally persuaded him that this was not a place for receiving foreign envoys and tried to get him to proceed to Shimoda. Putiatin, for whatever reason, suddenly departed Osaka on October 3rd and headed for Shimoda as advised. However, an unfortunate incident befell the Russian ship.

Reception officials had already been appointed by the shogunate for the Russian ship's return visit and negotiations had begun, but on November 4th a great tsunami struck the Tokai coast. Putiatin's ship Diana was capsized and the entire town of Shimoda was swept away in this unexpected disaster. Thus Putiatin found himself in circumstances no different from a shipwrecked sailor, but eventually obtained permission from the shogunate to establish a base at Heda in Izu to repair his ship.

However, when misfortune strikes, it continues relentlessly - just as the ship was about to be brought into Heda harbor, it encountered another storm and ultimately met its fate by sinking. But Putiatin did not give up, and at Heda undertook the construction of a new ship. Though it required tremendous hardship and effort, within several months he managed to build a large vessel suitable for his return journey.

The shogunate's reception officials for the Russian envoy were again Tsutsui Hizen-no-kami, Kawaji Saemon-jo, and three others. As a result of negotiations, since there had been prior agreements made at Nagasaki, it was reasonable that a treaty at least equal to that with America should be concluded. Generally speaking, one essentially identical to the American treaty was established, but there was a slight difference regarding the stationing of that country's officials at the open ports. Namely, the treaty with America still left room for further discussion, but the current treaty with Russia left almost no such room, so it appeared that after Ansei 3, such stationing would ultimately be difficult to refuse. Consequently, this matter became a source of future controversy. Other matters such as border issues were temporarily suspended, and there were also negotiations regarding Christianity due to opinions from Mito Nariaki.

But these too ultimately ended without achieving their objectives. However, in December of that year, American envoy Adams came to Shimoda for the ratification exchange and witnessed the dire straits of the Russian sailors before returning. Whether related to this or not, soon afterward an American schooner arrived at Shimoda and took about 150 Russian soldiers to Kamchatka. Meanwhile, the newly constructed ship was also completed, so Putiatin finally departed Shimoda on March 22nd of the following year, Ansei 2.

**The Impact of Foreign Ships' Arrival**
Though only three years passed from Kaei 6 to Ansei 2, the remarkable changes in our country's foreign policy were indeed as described above. Moreover, such changes were virtually unprecedented, so the profound transformation this foreign affairs issue brought to all contemporary trends was considerable.

First, having maintained strict isolationism for so long, there had been no need to build large ships in our country - indeed, as you know, construction of ships over 1,000 koku was strictly forbidden. Regarding gunnery as well, though the shogunate had hereditary gun magistrates, these were merely formal and completely inadequate for contemporary progress. Particularly regarding coastal defense, while figures like Matsudaira Sadanobu had paid attention to this matter, and later Watanabe Kazan and others had argued for it earnestly, generally the dream of isolationism remained unbroken, and due to the financial difficulties of the shogunate and various domains, virtually no preparations could be made. But this time, this very time, a great awakening was unavoidable.

Therefore, the shogunate lifted the prohibition on large ship construction on September 15th of Kaei 6. Also, on June 23rd of the same year, it ordered Junior Councilor Honda Etchu-no-kami and Finance Magistrate Kawaji Saemon-jo to survey the waters near Edo. As a result, on August 23rd of the same year, Finance Magistrates Matsudaira Kawachi-no-kami, Kawaji Saemon-jo, and three others were ordered to construct the famous battery platforms off Shinagawa. The casting of the cannons to be installed there was entrusted to Egawa Taro-zaemon, the Izu magistrate.

As you know, this Egawa Taro-zaemon was a disciple of Takashima Kihei (Shuhan) whom I mentioned briefly before, and had long studied the latest Western-style gunnery. In his domain he had a reverberatory...

Although this may not seem directly related to Toyohashi city history, I believe it necessary to briefly describe the Oda clan after Nobunaga's assassination for the sake of narrative continuity.

Now, as I described in the previous chapter, Mitsuhide's clan was destroyed in a short time, but after Hideyoshi, Nobutaka and others had defeated Mitsuhide, they entered Azuchi together and met with Oda Nobuo, who had just come from Ise at that time. They then entered Mino and Owari to pacify the former Oda territories, and proceeded to Kiyosu where they had an audience with Sanpōshi, Nobutada's eldest son. Sanpōshi was Nobunaga's legitimate grandson, and when Nobutada died, he had entrusted the boy to Maeda Gen'i at Nijō Castle. Gen'i, following this dying command, went to Gifu and then entered Kiyosu Castle.

When Hideyoshi and others arrived there, almost simultaneously the various generals who had been on distant campaigns came flooding in upon hearing news of the Honnōji incident - Shibata Katsuie and others from Echizen, Takigawa Kazumasu and others from Kōzuke, Mori Nagayoshi and others from Shinano. The first issue that arose was the succession of the Oda clan. Both Nobuo and Nobutaka were sons of Nobunaga, and coincidentally they were born in the same year and month, but although Nobutaka was born more than twenty days earlier, because his birth mother was of low status and notification of his birth came later, Nobuo was considered the elder brother. Moreover, regarding this campaign against Mitsuhide, Nobutaka had distinguished himself considerably, so naturally he felt he should be the successor. However, Nobuo would certainly not yield to him either, making the situation very difficult. Furthermore, the various generals also divided into these two factions, so the discussions continued for several days. Eventually it was decided that since Sanpōshi was the legitimate grandson, he should be the successor, and for the time being he would remain in Gifu under Nobutaka's care, with Nobuo also serving as co-regent, thus settling the matter.

At the same time, the four houses of Shibata, Hashiba, Niwa, and Ikeda would take turns stationing officials in the capital to handle administrative affairs. The former territories of Mitsuhide and Nobunaga's remaining domains were to be distributed to those with military merit: Nobuo received Owari, Nobutaka received Mino, Hideyoshi received Yamashiro, Katsuie received Nagahama in Gōshū, Ikeda Nobuteru received Osaka, Amagasaki, and Hyō-

-go Province, and Niwa Nagahide received the two districts of Takashima and Shiga in Gōshū Province - each receiving their portion in this manner. However, among these, the Nagahama that Katsuie received had originally been Hideyoshi's territory, which he had requested. This was secretly a means to connect with his home domain of Echizen and check Hideyoshi's power. Of course Hideyoshi was not unaware of this, but harboring great ambitions for the future, he not only meekly acquiesced to this matter but, despite being the greatest contributor this time, was content to receive only Yamashiro Province in exchange and did not争 over territories at all - this suggests he had great expectations elsewhere.

In any case, at this time the various generals exchanged written oaths with each other, pledged mutual friendship, and went to their respective domains. Hideyoshi then entered Kyoto and first held memorial services for Nobunaga at Daitoku-ji temple in Murasaki-no. This lasted seven days from October 11th to 17th, and the funeral ceremony on the 15th was said to be an unprecedented magnificent affair. Moreover, imperial commands came down from the Emperor himself, and in every matter things occurred that increased Hideyoshi's power, so his prestige thereafter rose ever higher like the morning sun ascending to heaven.

Now, this made Nobutaka unbearably frustrated, but Katsuie and Kazumasu also found it quite disagreeable, so eventually these two conspired with Nobutaka to secretly plot Hideyoshi's removal. However, this turned out to be a case where Hideyoshi took the initiative instead. As I mentioned before, while Sanpōshi was temporarily to remain in Gifu, since Gifu was ultimately Nobutaka's castle, once Azuchi Castle was rebuilt it would be appropriate for him to move there, and this had been decided. So Hideyoshi urgently pressed forward with the reconstruction of Azuchi Castle, and when it was completed he urged Sanpōshi's relocation. However, Nobutaka, harboring secret intentions, would not agree to this, so this became the immediate issue and instead Hideyoshi was the first to raise his banner. That is, Hideyoshi obtained Nobuo's consent and in the twelfth month of that year (Tenshō 10) raised an army, first entering Ōmi and attacking Katsuie's Nagahama Castle, forcing its surrender, then turning toward Mino and advancing on Gifu. For this campaign he had Niwa Nagahide, Tsutsui Junkei, Hosokawa Tadaoki, Ikeda Nobuteru, Hachiya...

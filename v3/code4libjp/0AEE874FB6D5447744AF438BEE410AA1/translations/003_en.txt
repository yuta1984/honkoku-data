Preface

The "Toyohashi City Tales" published as a supplement to the San'yo Shinpo newspaper from February 1911 (Meiji 44) continued for four and a half years until July 1915 (Taisho 4), and fortunately reached completion.

Given that it would be regrettable to simply abandon such an extensive series of lectures, the same newspaper company has now decided to compile them into a single booklet for wide public distribution, which is this book.

For me as the narrator, this is rather an embarrassing matter, but from another perspective, I believe there are profound reasons to rejoice in this.

Originally, Toyohashi City not only lacked a comprehensive city history, but was in a state where there were virtually no books sufficient for understanding the history of Toyohashi City.

Recognizing this as extremely regrettable, Toyohashi City undertook a city history compilation project in previous years, but it was determined that the collection of historical materials was necessary before compiling the city history.

Therefore, the municipal council at that time established an appropriate plan, obtained the cooperation of the city assembly, and proceeded with this objective while also holding exhibitions of city historical materials. The support from various quarters for this endeavor was extraordinary, particularly from the then assistant mayor Nagano Takezo and the municipal staff, as well as Tabei City [text cuts off mid-sentence]

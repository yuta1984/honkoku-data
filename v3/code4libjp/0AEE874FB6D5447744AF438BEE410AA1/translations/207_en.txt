Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Matsudaira Nobuyori's Succession) 386

...was spoken ill of by society. Moreover, it is said that even the cause of Yabe Suruga-no-kami's death by indignation stemmed from slander by Yōzō and others. However, this Yōzō later became Kai-no-kami and was the second son of the aforementioned Hayashi Jussai. Therefore, he was quite learned, and it seems he was not the villain that later generations denounced him as. However, his character was extremely petty, and as a result of being overly strict, he was not only completely unable to tolerate others but was harsh in all matters, making him truly resented by society. And the one giving him orders was the equally extreme Mizuno Tadakuni, so the resentment they gathered from all of Edo was remarkable.

The aforementioned Jussai died at age seventy-four in Tenpō 12, exactly when these great reforms were being carried out. However, he had already retired due to old age and illness before this, so it is believed he was probably uninvolved in the Watanabe Kazan incident I mentioned earlier.

**Tadakuni's Failure**
For these reasons, Tadakuni's great reforms eventually created various obstacles, and on September 13 in the intercalary ninth month of Tenpō 14, Tadakuni was dismissed from office, and his reform enterprise ultimately ended in failure. After Tadakuni, Doi Toshitsura took over and became senior councilor. However, this man was extremely conservative and generally overturned Tadakuni's policies. The following year the era name changed to Kōka, and on May 5 of the first year, Mito's Nariaki was finally ordered into house arrest.

**Mito Nariaki's House Arrest**
To be sure, Tadakuni had eventually come to differ with Nariaki on foreign policy matters, but during his tenure he had ostensibly honored Nariaki for political reasons. However, this latest development was nothing but the result of a complete reversal in the shogunate's policy, and relations between the shogunate and Mito became increasingly hostile.

**Nobuyori's Retirement**
Previously, on December 13 of Tenpō 13, Nobuyori retired and became Gyōbu-taiyu, while his son Nobutaka inherited the headship and was appointed Izu-no-kami. Soon after, Nobuyori passed away from illness on March 2 of Tenpō 15 (Kōka 1) (announced March 10) at the age of fifty-two, and was buried next to the family graves at Nobidome, receiving the posthumous name Shōten-in.

Here I would like to briefly mention Nobuyori's achievements during his tenure as senior councilor, but regrettably this is somewhat unclear. As I mentioned before, Nobuyori took office as senior councilor on May 16 of Tenpō 8, exactly the year Shogun Ieyoshi succeeded, but the date of his retirement is somewhat unclear. However, no matter how I research it, I believe he continued serving until his retirement, that is, until December 13 of Tenpō 13. Therefore, as mentioned above, when Mizuno Echizen-no-kami attempted to carry out major reforms of shogunal administration as senior councilor, Nobuyori must have participated in this.

**Circumstances of Nobuyori's Retirement**
What puzzles me is the circumstances of his retirement. Nobuyori's retirement came when he was exactly fifty years old, which seems somewhat early by normal standards. However, it is fact that Nobuyori was ill at the time. This is written about in the Shintoku-in Records as a retirement due to illness, and it is also recorded in the Court Diary of the well-known Nakayama Biseki (I plan to describe this person in detail later). Therefore, there is no doubt that the cause of his retirement was illness, but I suspect there may have been other circumstances involved as well.

As I mentioned before, Nobuyori was a person of frugal principles who naturally continued his father Nobuaki's legacy, but he also had a generous nature that cannot be ignored. Therefore, during his time as Osaka castle keeper, he placed great trust in Yabe Shunshū, and during his tenure as senior councilor, since he was still in a junior position, his opinions may not have been fully implemented. However, as I mentioned before, regarding the demotion of Yabe Shunshū from Edo magistrate, he may well have harbored private dissatisfaction.

Therefore, while he undoubtedly agreed with the main principles of Mizuno Echizen-no-kami's great reforms, I believe he may have found the overly harsh implementation disagreeable. Thus, taking advantage of his poor health, he may have requested retirement and stepped down from his position as senior councilor to avoid conflict. This is truly my personal opinion, and I wonder if it is appropriate to make it public, but I do believe there is some validity to this view...

...where these sixteen men were buried together.

**The Meeting at Kiyosu** Now, before this, in the first month of Eiroku 5, Ieyasu had gone to Kiyosu and met with Nobunaga in person. Subsequently, envoys also came from Nobunaga, and in the third month of the following year, Eiroku 6, it was decided that Nobunaga's daughter, Princess Toku, would be wed to Nobuyasu.

**Ieyasu's Name Change** That autumn, Ieyasu changed his name from Motoyasu, which he had used until then, to Ieyasu. There are various theories about this name change, but since a document given to Matsudaira Sanzo Nobitsugu in the sixth month of this year still bears the name Motoyasu, while a document granted to Matsudaira Kamechiyo and Matsui Sakon on the twenty-fourth day of the tenth month is signed Ieyasu, I believe the correct theory is that this name change must have occurred between these dates.

However, in the ninth month of this year, a major incident occurred that could truly be called an unexpected disaster for the Tokugawa. This was none other than the Ikko Senshu Rebellion.

**The Ikko Senshu Rebellion** The origin of this rebellion was really a trivial matter. In the ninth month of Eiroku 6, Suganuma Tojuro Sadaaki, acting on Ieyasu's orders, built a fortress at a place called Sasaki in Hekikai District. Due to a shortage of provisions, he forcibly requisitioned rice stored at a temple called Jogū-ji. The temple monks became angry and rallied with temples of the same sect such as Honsho-ji in Nodera and Shoman-ji in Harizaki, gathering their followers and attacking Sadaaki's fortress.

This became the cause for even those among the Tokugawa generals and retainers who were devout believers in the Ikko sect to side with these temples and turn their spears against Ieyasu, who was trying to suppress them. Consequently, allies began fighting among themselves, and the land of Western Mikawa became like a boiling cauldron. Even Kira Yoshiakira joined the temple faction, and even Arakawa Yoshihiro, who had previously been at odds with Yoshiakira, came to ally with them.

However, the Matsudaira of Takenotani, Katanohara, and Fukauzu faced the Imagawa forces beyond Nagasawa and Goyu to the east while confronting the rebels of Toro and Harizaki to the west, thus receiving attacks from front and rear and frequently struggling in hard-fought battles. Truly, such disorder within Mikawa Province was unprecedented, and I believe there has probably been nothing like it from the age of the gods until today. Of course, regarding the origins of this uprising...

...there are indeed different theories, with some saying it occurred in Eiroku 5. The Mikawa Monogatari also records:

"In Eiroku 5, year of Mizunoe-inu, there were troublemakers in the temple grounds of Nodera, and when Sakai Utanosuke pressed in to investigate and quarrels arose, in the first month of Eiroku Mizunoto-i, the various temple followers gathered and took refuge in Toro, Harizaki, Nodera, and Sasaki, raising a rebellion and becoming enemies."

While it was an ancient rule that the military could not immediately arrest anyone who entered temple or shrine lands, it appears from this that the uprising was triggered by the remnants of this custom. In any case, a minor incident became a major affair, and this turmoil continued until early in the following seventh year.

However, the generals and retainers who had temporarily opposed their lord for religious reasons gradually came to regret their wrongdoing, some converting their faith and others offering apologies and returning to service, so this uprising finally came to an end. Thereupon, Ieyasu further dispatched troops to Eastern Mikawa and proceeded to attack Yoshida Castle, which was its stronghold.

**○ The Battle of Yoshida**

Now, when early Eiroku 7 arrived and the Ikko Senshu uprising had been pacified, in the third month Ieyasu sent troops to Eastern Mikawa and first destroyed Nagasawa Castle. As mentioned in the previous chapter, this castle had already been captured by Tokugawa forces in the eighth month of Eiroku 4, but it appears that Imagawa forces had reoccupied it during the Western Mikawa disturbances. The Tokugawa forces broke through it once again this time.

The Tokugawa forces then gradually advanced to attack Ushikubo, but there are different theories about this battle, and many records do not mention the Battle of Nagasawa at this time. Also, some records describe the battle where Makino Yasunari died at Ushikubo, mentioned in the previous chapter, as actually occurring at this time. Works such as the Chōya Kyūbun Hōkō take this position regarding this point, but Tokugawa forces had attacked as far as Ushikubo many times since Eiroku 4, and according to traditions of both Makino families and their retainers...

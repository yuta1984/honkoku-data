were arranged in this manner side by side. To their right, Otani Yoshitsugu and others came and took position, and further connecting to the right wing, positioned diagonally toward the foot of Mount Matsuo, Wakizaka Yasuharu, Kuchiki Motosuna and others established their positions.

However, the eastern army also quickly detected this situation, so Ieyasu rejoiced at the arrival of the opportune moment and ordered departure. At this time, Fukushima Masanori and Kuroda Nagamasa served as the vanguard. Fukushima's unit advanced first toward Sekigahara, but this morning the light rain had not yet stopped and the fog was deep, so at dawn when they encountered the enemy's rear units, they could not distinguish even close distances. Both forces became confused and both sides were startled.

Therefore, the eastern army positioned Kuroda Nagamasa on the far right, followed in order by Hosokawa Tadaoki, Kato Yoshiaki, Tanaka Yoshimasa, Tsutsui Sadatsugu, Matsudaira Tadayoshi, and Ii Naomasa, taking positions north of the station facing the enemy lines. Kanamori Nagachika, Ikoma Kazumasa and others positioned themselves behind them, while Todo Takatoraand Kyogoku Takatomo positioned themselves south of the station facing the enemies on Mount Matsuo. Only Fukushima Masanori advanced from the foot of Mount Matsuo toward Ukita's position and established his camp there.

Meanwhile, Ieyasu also led his direct retainers to establish camp at Mount Momokubari east of Sekigahara. At this time, Ikeda Terumasa was originally supposed to deal with Ogaki Castle together with Asano Yoshinaga, Honda Tadakatsu and others, but instead he changed position to connect with Ieyasu's rear, establishing camp southwest of Tarui Station, specifically preparing against enemies on Mount Nangu. Even at this time, Terumasa earnestly requested to serve as vanguard, but Ieyasu persuaded him and placed him at this strategic point.

Now the battle finally began past 7 AM in the morning. Initially, Ii Naomasa assisted Matsudaira Tadayoshi in engaging Ukita's position, and Fukushima Masanori similarly attacked Ukita's forces. Subsequently, Todo and Kyogoku's units attacked Otani's position, while generals including Oda Uraku, Furuta Shigekatsu, and Sakuma Yasumasa, who were positioned behind Hosokawa and Kato, moved against Konishi's unit. Kuroda, of course, along with Tanaka, Hosokawa, Kato, Kanamori, Ikoma and other units all moved against Ishida's forces.

Thus the battle gradually became fierce, but the western army also fought quite well, making it difficult to determine victory easily. Therefore, past 9 AM, Ieyasu advanced his main force to the eastern entrance of the station. At that time, Honda Tadakatsu was in the rear, so he requested permission to advance and finally engaged with both Konishi and Uki-

-ta's forces, defeating them, then moved against Shimazu's front units. However, victory was still not easily decided, so the western army also raised beacon fires to urge the units on both Mount Matsuo and Mount Nangu to attack downward, but they did not respond.

As it was already approaching noon, the eastern army also urgently urged Hideaki's support. Originally, as you all know, Kobayakawa Hideaki had been in secret communication with Ieyasu from the beginning. Although he was compelled to join the western army in attacking Fushimi Castle, even then there are facts showing his various struggles with the situation.

Especially this time, he had frequently maintained contact with the eastern army, and the eastern army had even secretly sent Okudaira Sadaharu to his camp on Mount Matsuo. Therefore, at this point he finally openly raised the banner of rebellion against the western army, immediately charging down the mountain and launching a sudden attack directly against Otani's position.

This ultimately became the catalyst for the western army's defeat, so Ieyasu immediately released his direct retainers and ordered a general attack. The western army indeed became scattered and fragmented, with its generals either dying or fleeing.

Only Shimazu Yoshihiro held his ground until the end, but finally unable to maintain his position, he broke through the eastern army and escaped via the Makita route. However, under pursuit by the forces of Fukushima, Kobayakawa, Ii, and Honda, his son Toyohisa was killed in battle.

Consequently, the western army on Mount Nangu also retreated without fighting, and thus the general course of the Battle of Sekigahara ended as described above.

Moreover, regarding the military strength of both armies at this time, initially the western army had a total force of about 79,000 men while the eastern army had about 70,000, so in that respect the western army was superior. However, the western army lacked unified command. Mitsunari was, so to speak, the chief strategist but in the position of staff officer, lacking sufficient authority as supreme commander.

In contrast, the eastern army had Ieyasu firmly unifying command. He held back his main force without moving rashly, and when the fighting opportunity matured for his advance units, he first tested Hideaki's allegiance, and as soon as he saw that the enemy army had no more reinforcing units, he immediately ordered his forces to launch a general attack. Even those of us who know nothing about military tactics can somehow sense the orderly nature of his approach.

Particularly, as you know, the eastern army had not only Hideaki but also collaborators like Kikkawa and Fukuhara, who were related to Mori Hidemoto,

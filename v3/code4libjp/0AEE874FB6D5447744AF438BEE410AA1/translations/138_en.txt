...he kept two gold coins, writing on the wrapping paper "Wherever I may collapse, please hide my body. This is to cover the expenses" - an even lighter matter than Hakuhen carrying a plow. However, he was a vigorous person who, approaching the age of ninety, would wear wooden clogs and go to eat at the tea shops of Kurodani three times a day, and thirty mon was sufficient to pass a day, it is said.

Initially he stored rice in what was called a fire-extinguishing pot, but even that may have become tedious. He gave a biwa lute inscribed "Token" and two volumes of the Tale of the Heike to Mr. Yamada, a retainer of Mikawa, and they are still preserved in that family.

With this, I think the general character of the person can be understood. When this person was in Yoshida, he held the position of chief retainer to the Makino clan, and his residence was the corner mansion on the south side of what is now West 8th district, in front of Goshiñ Temple. Originally a master of the biwa, he constructed a garden with trees and springs within his estate, invited the deity Myōonten and built a mound, naming it "Biwa Mound," whose remains existed until recent years.

Also, when Nizō finally left Yoshida to go into retirement, he presented his beloved instrument, the biwa inscribed "Token," to the Yamada family of this area, as mentioned in the Kijinden. This Yamada family was the honjin (official inn) of this area called Edoya, but now I don't know what became of that biwa, as the family seems to have died out.

Also, the current family of Mr. Ono Dōhei is quite an old family that was already thriving in this area at that time. The master of that time, called Kyūbei, was a close friend of Nizō, and the letters sent after Nizō retired to Okazaki in Kyoto are still preserved in that family. Additionally, there is a self-portrait with inscription by Nizō mentioned in the Kijinden, and the actual piece is kept by Mr. Katō Yatarō of Ōaza Kanente. However, while both are painted in almost identical brushwork, there are considerable differences, suggesting that he created many such self-portraits. The portrait itself is a simple one-brush drawing, merely depicting the back view of a monk in simplified strokes, but the brushwork, painting style, and inscription show truly unworldly qualities that are interesting and moving. The inscription is a poem as follows:

⦿ The Ōkōchi Clan and Its Ancestors

As mentioned in the previous chapter, the one who was enfeoffed as lord of Yoshida Castle to replace the Makino clan was Matsudaira Izunokami Nobutoki. This Matsudaira Izunokami's family is the present Ōkōchi Viscount family, which I believe you are already aware of. Moreover, this family was the lord of our Toyohashi for the longest period, so considerable material worthy of research from their period of rule still remains today.

Of course, this Nobutoki later transferred to Hamamatsu, and afterward Matsudaira (Honjo) Sukesato briefly became castle lord. I plan to discuss this matter in detail in a later chapter, but Nobutoki's son Nobunao later returned to succeed the Honjo clan, coming from Hamamatsu to this area, and from then on, generation after generation remained until the Restoration. In other words, our Toyohashi City inherited the aftermath of this Ōkōchi clan's rule and underwent the changes following the Restoration, which is the present situation. Therefore, to study present-day Toyohashi City, research into the Ōkōchi clan's period of rule is particularly necessary. So from now on, I would like to proceed with this research step by step together with you all.

Now, what I would like to discuss first is the lineage of the Ōkōchi family. This Nobutoki was the great-great-grandson of the famous Matsudaira Izunokami Nobutsuna. Nobutsuna's son was Terutsuna, his son was Nobuteru, and his son was this Nobutoki. Originally, according to what the family tradition conveys, this family belongs to the Seiwa Genji, so needless to say, they are descendants of the Six Grandson Prince Tsunemoto, and derive from Minamoto no Yorimasa, whom you all know as Gen Ichii. Yorimasa's second son, a man named Kanetsuna, fought alongside his father Yorimasa against the Taira forces in the Battle of Uji River in the 5th month of Jishō 4 [May 1180] and ultimately died in battle. His son Akitsuna was still a two-year-old infant at that time,

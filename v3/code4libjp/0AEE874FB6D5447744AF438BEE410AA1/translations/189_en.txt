Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Anecdotes of Matsudaira Nobuaki) 350

**Main Text:**

aki had apparently been waiting for this report for some time and immediately granted an audience. After listening thoroughly to the inspector's report, he showed deep grief, saying "What an unavoidable tragedy this was." The inspector was truly moved by Nobuaki's love for his retainers, as recorded in the book.

On another occasion, when Nobuaki was passing through the Asakusa checkpoint, for some reason the gatekeeper failed to perform the proper bow. The guard captain was extremely embarrassed and chased after the procession to appeal to the retinue leader for forgiveness. However, when Nobuaki heard of this, he said, "There is no need to worry. It must have been some mistake. When we passed through the Asakusa checkpoint, everyone performed the proper bow." He did not punish the offense. This guard captain was so moved by Nobuaki's benevolence that from then on, whenever he passed in front of the residence, he would always bow in gratitude.

Another story from the Bunka era tells of a Buddhist nun who somehow wandered into the main keep of the castle, creating quite a problem. When this matter was brought to Senior Councilor Nobuaki for judgment, he declared: "She is probably not a real nun. It must surely be the work of fox spirits. For whatever reason, there is no way a nun should be able to enter the main keep." With this decisive judgment, the gate guards and all responsible parties were relieved of blame and rejoiced. This story is recorded in the Sugaku-kun Genkoroku (Record of Lord Sugaku's Words and Deeds).

**Nobuaki's Resistance to Authority**
Nobuaki's temperament was roughly as described above. Once he became convinced that something was unreasonable, he would absolutely refuse to accept it, and in such cases, he feared no authority whatsoever.

Another story from Nobuaki's time as Senior Councilor tells how one day, as he was heading to the castle, a Mito retainer came running and said, "Lord Mito is in his palanquin - stand aside!" pushing back Nobuaki's advance guard. The retinue leader, Matsuo Goro, ran to Nobuaki's palanquin to report this, but Nobuaki remained completely calm. Suddenly, in a loud voice, he commanded: "We are proceeding to the castle on urgent business. Lord Mito's palanquin has not yet arrived, so there is no problem. Continue forward at full speed!" and proceeded to the castle.

Later, he consulted with his colleagues and sent word to the Mito family's senior retainer: "Since this interferes with important official duties, henceforth Lord Mito's castle visits should be timed to avoid conflicts with the Senior Councilors' arrival times."

On another occasion, sweets arrived from somewhere, and Nobuaki had them placed in the tokonoma alcove before going to the castle. When he returned and looked at the sweets, their arrangement was disturbed, appearing as if someone had handled them. Nobuaki had those who had handled them investigated, but everyone claimed ignorance and no progress was made. Unusually angered, Nobuaki had his attendants interrogate a certain page who had initially handled the delivery. Under questioning, the page confessed that the sweets were so beautiful that he had secretly picked one up, but when word came of his lord's return, he panicked and tried to return it to its original position. Having no time, he was forced to hide one piece in his sleeve pocket. When Nobuaki heard this confession and apology, his expression softened for the first time: "How good that you told the truth honestly. If you had continued to lie and conceal it, I would have had you executed, but now I am satisfied." He did not pursue the matter further.

These stories truly reveal Nobuaki's character in its entirety and provide fascinating insights into his personality.

**Nobuaki's Acceptance of Remonstrance**
In his younger years, Nobuaki had a tendency to drink excessively, and his temperament gradually became rougher, causing his close attendants great concern. The senior retainer Sato Kyuemon, considering this a serious matter that could not be ignored, apparently resolved to act. One evening, he appeared at Nobuaki's drinking party and strongly remonstrated that he should henceforth abstain from alcohol. Nobuaki was extremely displeased and angrily said, "How dare you speak so rudely! Withdraw!" Sato, thinking that further remonstrance would be futile, withdrew for the time being. But even after returning home, he could not bear his worry, so he contemplated the future deeply and sat silently in a room. Late that night, urgent...

**Perry's Departure**
Finally, on October 13th of our Kaei 5 (1852), all preparations were complete and Perry departed from Norfolk in his home country. After rounding the Cape of Good Hope and gradually emerging onto East Asian waters, he arrived in Macao on April 6th of the following year, reached Shanghai on May 4th, where Perry himself boarded the Susquehanna and, leading two other ships, the Mississippi and Supply, first visited Ryukyu on May 26th.

**Perry's Arrival in Ryukyu**
There were indeed many noteworthy aspects of Perry's behavior in Ryukyu, but as I do not have the time to describe them in detail now, I shall omit them. Perry then proceeded to explore the Ogasawara Islands, returned again to Ryukyu, and finally set course for our country on July 2nd. At this time, Perry's fleet consisted of four ships: first the flagship Susquehanna (steam warship), the Mississippi (same), and the sailing ships Saratoga and Plymouth. Of these, the two sailing ships had joined later, while the Supply that he had brought earlier was left behind at Naha Port in Ryukyu.

**Perry Anchors in Uraga Bay**
Thus Perry appeared off Jōgashima in Sagami Province at the hour of the sheep on June 3rd of our Kaei 6 (July 8th, 1853) and immediately ordered his four ships to prepare for battle. The junior officials under the Uraga magistrate attempted to approach in several small boats to deter them, but the Americans remained completely calm and not only refused to let these small boats approach, but also, having neither sails nor oars, sailed swiftly against the headwind and advanced further into the bay—a sight that naturally left our shogunate officials stunned.

When this fleet anchored in Uraga Bay, Uraga Magistrate Toda Izunokami Ujihide immediately sent his subordinates to the American ships, but the Americans still refused to receive them. At this time on our shore, signal guns were fired and those responsible for coastal defense took up their positions in their respective areas, creating indescribable confusion. At this time, a yoriki (magistrate's assistant) named Nakajima Saburosuke, who could speak Dutch, identified himself as a vice-official and was permitted to board the ship, where he briefly conversed with Perry's flag officer. Thus it was confirmed that this ship was indeed, as expected,

an American fleet, and moreover, that it carried a letter from the American president to our shogun. However, our prohibitions and demands that they go to Nagasaki if they had business were flatly rejected by them. Furthermore, they demanded that our guard boats withdraw and showed an attitude suggesting they would attack if we refused to comply.

**Yoriki Nakajima Saburosuke**
The yoriki Nakajima Saburosuke I just mentioned was the uncle of a Yoshida domain retainer named Hozumi Seiken, whom I hope to discuss in detail later, and was actually someone with very close connections to the Dutch scholars in our Yoshida domain. This man later fled to Hakodate with Enomoto Kamajirō, and I believe the considerable influence that these advocates of opening the country had on our Yoshida domain retainers is quite noteworthy.

**The Scene at Uraga Bay**
Now, the scene at Uraga Bay that night was truly terrifying, with beacon fires being lit everywhere on land to spread warnings far and wide, and all manner of alarm bells being rung throughout the night. The American flagship also fired its 9 PM signal gun, which greatly alarmed the Japanese.

Given these circumstances, the confusion of that time was beyond what we can imagine today. The next day passed with similar repetitions while the Uraga magistrate sought instructions from the shogunate. But the shogunate too was truly perplexed by this situation, and realizing that it was clearly impossible to drive away these American ships using conventional methods, they were greatly troubled. Above all, if hostilities were to break out with the American ships and their fleet gradually advanced into waters near Edo, the import of materials essential to Edo's citizens would be completely cut off—this seems to have been their primary concern.

Therefore, concluding that methods to make the American ships depart peacefully were necessary, they decided that there was no choice but to comply with their demands by dispatching a special envoy to receive the letter they had brought.

...tsugu was lord of Yoshida Castle, and Tadatsugu also took refuge in this monk Genryū, and his wife also dedicated portraits of her mother to this temple, which are still preserved today as I mentioned in detail in the previous chapter. Ōkubo Tadayoshi was truly a great devotee of this person, constantly inviting this monk for Zen meditation, which is also recorded in the Ryūnenji temple records. After Tadayoshi moved to Futamata Castle, he built a temple called Kuonji and invited this monk there, and much later when he was enfeoffed at Odawara, he built a temple called Banshōin in a place called Fuusai Village in the vicinity and took this person there as well. These two temples still exist today and continue as branch temples of Ryūnenji, but since this Banshōin was the final residence of the monk Genryū, if documents from that time remained in this temple it would be extremely valuable, but unfortunately during the time of Tadayoshi's son Tadachika, the Ōkubo clan temporarily fell into disfavor and the temple also nearly fell into ruin, so almost all the treasures were lost. However, there remains a painting of Amida Sanzon that Nobuyasu had faith in during his lifetime. This painting was dedicated by Tadayoshi after Nobuyasu's death for his spiritual benefit, but during the temple's decline it was temporarily preserved at Ryūnenji. Later when the Ōkubo family was again enfeoffed at Odawara, in the second year of Shōtoku during the time of the family head Tadamasu, with permission from Ryūnenji this was returned to Banshōin, and on its reverse side should be written in Nobuyasu's own hand "Sanzon Mida genkō fushigi zai Matsudaira Saburō ya" [The miraculous light of the Three Buddhas of Amida resides in Matsudaira Saburō]. However, since I have not yet actually seen this, I cannot say for certain, but a copy of the inquiry document sent from Ryūnenji to the Ōkubo family in the second year of Shōtoku still remains at Ryūnenji. Also, extracts from Ryūnenji's old records regarding this matter from the fifth month of Kansei 9 also remain, and according to these records, the monk Genryū was not only a refuge for Tadayoshi alone, but Nobuyasu also took refuge and practiced Zen meditation with him. The aforementioned Banshōin was built for Nobuyasu's spiritual benefit. Also at Ryūnenji there are memorial tablets for Nobuyasu and Tadayoshi which are still enshrined there, and both appear to be made at that time and certainly do not seem to be from later periods. They were surely placed here due to their relationship with the monk Genryū.

I believe. In any case, by conducting thorough research on these matters and comparing them with accounts in works like the Mikawa Monogatari and Matsudaira-ki, I get the feeling that some information about the circumstances of Nobuyasu's final days might be obtained, but since I have not yet had time to conduct such deep investigation, I will limit myself here to providing an incomplete but general account for your reference.

I would like to add that regarding the year of Nobuyasu's suicide, the Mikawa Monogatari records it as occurring in Tenshō 6, but the Matsudaira-ki and various other records state it was Tenshō 7, and this can be confirmed by the Ietada Nikki. That is, Nobuyasu was twenty-one years old. The day of suicide was September 15th, and there seems to be no conflicting account. The monk Genryū died in the second month of Keichō 7, and a portrait of him with an inscription from Genna 6 is now preserved at Ryūnenji and serves as valuable historical material.

○ Overview of the Honnōji Incident and the Battle of Yamazaki

Now, as I mentioned in the previous chapter, Nobunaga destroyed the Takeda clan and returned to his castle in the fourth month of Tenshō 10. Afterwards, Tokugawa Ieyasu, accompanied by the former Takeda general Anayama Nobukimi who had surrendered, went to Azuchi to express his gratitude. Of course, Nobunaga's power at that time was extraordinary, and even Ieyasu revered him almost like a lord. In the Ietada Nikki written by Matsudaira Ietada at that time, while Ieyasu's name is clearly written as "Ieyasu," Nobunaga is referred to with honorifics as "Ue-sama" or "Nobunaga-sama." Ieyasu's party arrived at Azuchi on the fifteenth day of the fifth month of that year, and Sakai Tadatsugu naturally accompanied them. At this time Nobunaga ordered his retainers to serve as hosts and lavishly entertained them, personally serving Ieyasu's meal and taking food with his own hands to give to Tadatsugu and other officers. This is recorded in the entry for the twentieth day of the fifth month in the Ietada Nikki, as written in a letter sent by courier from the accompanying Udono Zen'roku. This shows the attitude that the Tokugawa clan had toward Nobunaga at that time, and...

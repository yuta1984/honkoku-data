Before the relocation could be carried out, Terumasa was transferred to Himeji, so Gōshin Temple ended up gaining from receiving the replacement land. Although the relocation was ultimately abandoned, the temple site that Terumasa had provided still results in the temple owning over 9,700 tsubo of land in Ōaza Hanada, Aza Chikuji to this day. In addition, there is a legend that it was also Terumasa who relocated and gathered the city's blacksmiths to what is now commonly called Moto-kajimachi. However, considering this from various circumstances, it seems quite credible.

Regarding the castle grounds, it is believed that most of what remains today was certainly planned by Terumasa. Although this is only based on legends recorded in works like "Mikawa no Kuni Futabamatsu" and "Mikawa Tsutsumi" and oral traditions, it is clear from records of battles of that time and the bridge positions I mentioned earlier that the castle grounds during the Sakai clan's residence were by no means as large as they are today. Since no major construction was added to this castle after Terumasa, and during the Tokugawa period arbitrary expansion of castle grounds was not permitted, I believe the legends and oral traditions mentioned earlier are entirely factual. In any case, for a daimyo of 152,000 koku at that time, this was a relatively large-scale plan.

There is also a legend that the former Yagyu Gate was originally the main gate of Nagashino Castle that was moved to this castle, but it is somewhat unclear whether this was during Sakai Tadatsugu's time or Terumasa's time. However, "Mikawa no Kuni Futabamatsu" states: "Some say that in ancient times the main gate was called Akumi Gate, but later Yagyu Gate was used as the main approach, and there was castle construction during Ikeda Sanzaemon's time." This suggests that initially Akumi Gate was the main gate, but later Yagyu Gate became the main approach, and this account seems certainly correct. Ultimately, I believe it is factual that Terumasa carried out relatively large-scale expansions of both Yoshida Castle and the urban area, which became the foundation for everything that remains today.

What I constantly wonder about is who originally carried out the flood control works on the Toyokawa River. Namely, this...

...river had steep and wide banks since ancient times, making even ferry crossings difficult, but gradually became filled with sediment until even earthen bridges could be built, as I have mentioned repeatedly before. The flood control works that actually remain are quite ingenious, and while I cannot say how they would be evaluated by today's academic standards, they were certainly achievements that only a great civil engineer could have accomplished. The bypass at Miyaido upstream and the construction of Minotsutsumi and other works must have been quite ingenious for their time. Among all the successive castle lords, I believe Terumasa was the only one suitable to accomplish such works.

Recently I visited Himeji in Harima Province and observed Terumasa's achievements. Among the projects he undertook after moving from Yoshida to Himeji - the construction of Hakuro Castle (White Heron Castle), the planning of Sanzaemon Moat, and the urban planning in a rice-character pattern - I felt there were quite striking similarities. However, this is merely my speculation, and I present this opinion seeking your learned guidance.

As described above, while the details of the projects Terumasa implemented in Yoshida are regrettably not precisely known, from a general perspective these represented unprecedented planning for this region, and I believe no subsequent projects have matched this scale to the present day. Whether considering his planning in this area or his methods in Himeji, both show grand-scale projects comparable to Katō Kiyomasa's development of Kumamoto, truly displaying the enterprising spirit of military commanders of the Toyotomi era, which fills one with admiration. Terumasa came to Yoshida at age twenty-seven, still in his youth, and remained in this region for nearly ten years until Keichō 5 (1600).

Regarding Terumasa's background up to this point, to summarize briefly: as you know, he was the second son of Ikeda Nobuteru, with the childhood name Koshin. Initially written as Terumasabut later as Terumasa. His elder brother was called Nosuke. His father Nobuteru was the son of Oda Nobunaga's wet nurse, so he served the Oda clan from the time of Nobunaga's father Nobuhide and achieved considerable fame. However, after Nobunaga's death...

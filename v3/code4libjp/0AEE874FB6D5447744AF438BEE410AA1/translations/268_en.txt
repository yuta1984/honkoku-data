This is what is written. The Kusakato mentioned refers to the Kusakato family, who were shrine priests at Ichinomiya Shrine, and Hatano naturally refers to Takao. According to this, when Kozan built this Nankō Shrine, he consulted with these two men and clearly obtained the domain lord's permission.

The plaque reading "Kusunoki Shrine" that hung at this shrine was written by Ōhara Sanmi and carved into camphor wood by Master Todō, but I have not yet had the opportunity to see what became of it.

Another matter I would like to mention here is that Kozan changed his surname from Yokoyama to Ono. This occurred when he was fifty years old, in Genji 1 (1864), and at that time he had a seal carved with the inscription "Like Meifuku, I change my name in middle age"—this is according to Master Todō's direct account. Indeed, the original surname of the Yokoyama family was Ono, so this was the circumstance of the change. At that time he also changed his given name from Sensuke to Dōnosuke. Later, after the Restoration, he further changed his name to Chōgen, which I believe you are all already aware of.

The friends Kozan associated with before his confinement were truly numerous, and among them were many famous people. The names gathered in the "Kozanrō Poetry Screen" were probably all people he had associated with, and the number of people recorded appears to be about eighty-nine, including naturally the Seigan couple, and notably Rai Sanyō, Ōtsuki Bankei, Kikuchi Gozan, Ōnuma Chinzan, Satō Issai, Fujita Tōko, Fujimori Kōan, Yasui Sokken, Bitō Suichiku, Rai Miki, Ōhashi Totsu'an, Matsumoto Keidō, Fujimoto Tesseki, Sakuma Zōzan, and Ohara Tesshin.

Now, regarding his residence period in Yoshida, among the local people, as I mentioned before, Sekine Chidō appears to have been closest to him, but besides him, there were many associates including naturally Hatano Takao and Sano Hōu, as well as the Kusakato family of Ichinomiya Shrine, Kaneko Gyoten, Nagao Kayō, and Ono Todō. He frequently visited the home of Ishikawa Yoneami in Honmachi. During the period when he taught students at the Ōte Long Houses, not only Master Teishū but also present-day Dr. Ōsawa Kenji and Abe Taizō attended, and Hattori Kōshō also attended as a young boy.

However, by that time, the aforementioned Konan Setsu'an had little contact with him.

When Kozan was detained by the domain in October of Ansei 6, he composed this poem:

"Sudden summons seemed purposeful / Severe censure truly startling / How could hills and valleys not change? / Wearily, wearily I lament my life / Prematurely aging, both temples white / Simple learning, light of body / No inch of effectiveness in serving country / Facing the sun, embracing slight sincerity / Was it not slanderous brocade? / The web of accusations, how extensive! / Rumors not to be taken lightly / Five characters confirm the crime's name"

This truly captures the circumstances of that time well. Indeed, the charges for Kozan's confinement were the quite vague "rumors not to be taken lightly." During his transport from Edo to Yoshida, he composed poems in his palanquin thinking of his old friends in Edo. These are truly valuable for reference, so let me introduce three or four from among those dozen or so poems:

**Composed casually over a dozen poems in the palanquin, thinking of various old friends in Edo—but when can I send them by post? Alas!**

"Looking up and down, I only lament my way is blocked / Thinking of you whom I cannot see, through misty rain / Writing books—is it merely beautiful literature? / Worrying for country, I especially admire heroic spirit / The scholar's great name weighs heavy in this world / The shogunate's great persecution reaches this old man / Unknown whether the proposed punishment will be light or heavy / Looking back at the capital gate through smoky trees" (Master Fujimori Kōan)

"No chance for farewell conversation, suddenly at heaven's edge / Looking back on our life together, empty sighs / Hearts heroic in serving country, together we watched swords / Clever schemes in handling poverty, together we viewed flowers / All things are illusions—what more is there to say? / Our friendship surpassed gold and orchids, nothing could exceed it / Wild indulgence brought trouble—whose fault from long ago? / I hope you will take me as a warning for your cart" (Washizu Kidō)

"Before the wine cup we once made winter's alliance / Generous spirit and sad songs, boundless emotion / One parting from all you gentlemen, regret at difficult meeting / Moreover, with you one parting separates the living from the dead" (Nakamura Genzō—Genzō died last month)

Also, a poem from when he crossed the sea at Arai during the journey:

**In a boat at Arai (On the 29th day crossed Arai, that night at first watch entered Yoshida Castle)**
"One sail lightly rises, what splendid wind! / Moreover, joy that clouds and sky allow views in all directions / The officials' constraints—how can they be described? / In the boat, not permitted to emerge from the palanquin"

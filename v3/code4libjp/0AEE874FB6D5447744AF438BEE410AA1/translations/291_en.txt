　　　　　　I would like to receive your guidance. End.

　　　　　　Then the senior councilors sent a reply to the above to the Osaka castle deputy in the following July, which reached Osaka on the 16th of that month. The full text is as follows:

　　　　　　Although the deadline for expelling foreigners has been proclaimed, since port-closing negotiations are currently underway, recklessly opening hostilities would be absolutely unacceptable, so when relations finally break down, we will issue directives at that time. Until then, we instructed in our previous correspondence that you should direct the security forces there to avoid rash actions, and this was promptly communicated to each party. However, regarding Matsudaira Sagami-no-kami, when the British ship arrived off Mount Mejirushi on the 14th of last month, he drove it away and has already received words of praise from Kyoto. Moreover, last year he was appointed as governor-general by the imperial court, and at that time he understood that he should act according to the guidance of Hitotsubashi Chūnagon and Shungaku. Furthermore, now that he has received imperial commands to drive away [foreigners] without hesitation, if we convey to Sagami-no-kami what we stated in our previous correspondence, we are concerned about what inconveniences he might create by appealing to Kyoto. Security of Osaka has been assigned to Tachibana Hida-no-kami, and Matsudaira Sagami-no-kami has been relieved of duty, though the handover has not yet occurred. We understand from your detailed report that you wish to temporarily withhold the directive mentioned in our previous correspondence regarding Sagami-no-kami after deep consideration. As stated previously, port-closing negotiations are underway, and particularly since there are now imperial intentions conveyed to Kyoto, you should make every effort to communicate to Sagami-no-kami to avoid rash actions. Of course, once the handover with Tachibana Hida-no-kami is completed, there will be no need to communicate the above to Sagami-no-kami, and you should thoroughly communicate it to Hida-no-kami. Furthermore, you should continue to carefully handle matters for the benefit of the country after thorough consideration. We communicate this matter. End.

　　　　　　Despite such circumstances, on August 18th the Osaka castle deputy again issued the following directive to the security forces of the Settsu Sea area:

　　　　　　Regarding the expulsion of foreign barbarians, there have been repeated communications from the court transmitters to the various domains, but since port-closing negotiations are ongoing and relations have not yet broken down, recklessly opening hostilities would bring about national disgrace and is absolutely unacceptable, so when relations finally break down, we intend to quickly send communications. Moreover, since there are now imperial intentions conveyed to Kyoto, we were told by the senior councilors last month that directives should be issued to handle matters peacefully for now, which we duly communicated. However, in the current situation, we understand that there have been no proclamations whatsoever from Edo. This may naturally be due to miscommunication. However, the matter of expelling foreign barbarians has long been proclaimed, and particularly the recent imperial edicts being issued demonstrate the firm imperial decision for expulsion. Originally, this area is close to the imperial capital and is a particularly crucial coastline. Given that we have reached such pressing times when delay is no longer acceptable, from now on, not only in the Settsu Sea but also in the nearby waters facing similar pressure, when foreigners arrive, the imperial command is to drive them away without hesitation. We respectfully obey this command, and you should understand that our previous directives are to be considered withdrawn. We communicate this matter accordingly.

*{Marginal note: Notification regarding the political change of August 18th}* From these documents, I believe we can clearly understand the situation at that time. Moreover, the political upheaval that suddenly erupted in Kyoto on August 18th, as I mentioned in the previous chapter, was unforeseen not only by the Chōshū faction but also by the radical party...

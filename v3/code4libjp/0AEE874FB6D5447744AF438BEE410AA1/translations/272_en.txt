However, the hopes that Senior Councilor Ando and others had initially harbored came to nothing, and harmony between court and shogunate could ultimately not be achieved through this marriage. Initially, when the court granted imperial permission for Princess Kazunomiya's marriage, there was simultaneously an imperial order to the shogunate that if they were to pursue court-shogunate unity in this manner, they must expel the foreign barbarians. The shogunate responded that since external campaigns would be difficult without internal order, they wished to quickly announce the intent of court-shogunate cooperation to the realm, achieve unity of the people's hearts, and then devote themselves wholeheartedly to defense against foreign barbarians and devise strategies for expulsion, considering this marriage proposal to be truly fortunate. This arranged the marriage successfully, but at that time the shogunate was so eager to make this marriage succeed that they gave what could be called an insincere response about expelling foreigners. This arose from the naive belief that once court-shogunate unity was achieved, they could somehow manage everything afterward, but their thinking produced completely opposite results in reality, inevitably leading them into a situation of being bound by their own actions. Such circumstances actually intensified anti-foreign fervor even more, increasingly heightening the ardor of the loyalist expulsion party. In any case, as I mentioned before, Senior Councilor Ii, for better or worse, relied on his decisive nature, his position and convictions, backed by the accumulated authority of the Tokugawa over more than two hundred years, and seemed to face the realm with stern authority, so for a time his suppression policies appeared to work magnificently. But when this met the fate of being frustrated midway, there was no successor who could match Ii in prestige, power, or personal capacity. In such circumstances, needlessly provoking the loyalist activists would be rather counterproductive, so the subsequent shogunal cabinet tried to adopt exclusively peaceful policies. However, in such situations this was by no means a policy that could succeed, and instead the shogunate lost its authority and the center of political power gradually shifted toward Kyoto. Here another change that should be mentioned is the death of Mito Nariaki. As you know, Nariaki had been a leader of one faction,

bearing the great expectations of the realm as what could be called an enemy state of the shogunate. But he died of illness on August 15th of Man'en 1, about six months after Senior Councilor Ii's assassination. Originally, the reason Nariaki carried such weight in the realm was that he had exceptional men like Toda Chudayu and Fujita Toko under him who assisted him, which contributed greatly to his influence. But as you know, these two men, Toda and Fujita, both died suddenly in the great earthquake of Ansei 2, and since then Mito Domain's actions lacked unity and tended toward rash violence, gradually losing the sympathy of informed people. However, while Nariaki was still alive, he continued to bear great responsibility in the realm. But with his death this time, the domain immediately lost its leader and became solely concerned with internal factional struggles, leading to extreme confusion and thus losing the center of their hopes and completely losing their influence. At this time, it was the Choshu and Satsuma domains that gradually extended their power to the center, and this ultimately became a major cause for the political center to gradually shift westward to Kyoto.

Originally, to study the circumstances from the end of the shogunate through the Restoration, I think it would be necessary to first study the internal situations of the Satsuma and Choshu domains, but unfortunately there is no room here to discuss such matters, so I must reluctantly omit them. In summary, from Man'en 1 through the following Bunkyu 1, the so-called rampaging of loyalist activists became increasingly severe: in the east, Mito ronin were central in disturbing the Hitachi and Shimotsuke regions, while in the west, Satsuma and Choshu activists mainly rushed about here and there making various plans. These also infiltrated Edo, communicating with each other, sometimes killing foreign envoys or attacking legations, creating truly endless disturbances. The well-known figures like Okubo, Kido, and Saigo, who would later be called the three great men of the Restoration, were at this time also rushing about among the activists and scheming considerably. During such times, from what source it arose I know not, but Senior Councilor Ando most regrettably planned to depose...

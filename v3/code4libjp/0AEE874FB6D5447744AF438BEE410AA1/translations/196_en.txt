**Nobuaki Expands Jishūkan**
Thus Jishūkan was established, but I believe there were still quite a few incomplete aspects. However, when Nobuaki's era came, as I mentioned before, he once retired from his senior councilor position and from Bunka 2 (1805) resided in his domain, coming to Yoshida. During this time he devoted himself to promoting this domain school, so its scale seems to have been considerably expanded. This...

**Nishioka Zensuke**
At this time, Nishioka Zensuke was selected and became the domain's Confucian official, appointed to the teaching position. Zensuke's given name was En and his literary name was Tenshin. He wrote a book called "Rongo Chōkun Yakuran" (Analects Training Overview). Since there are new regulations for Jishūkan that were established at this time, I will introduce them below as well.

**Jishūkan Regulations**
Regarding Jishūkan, by His Lordship's gracious consideration, excellent arrangements have been successively ordered. Therefore, all those attending the academy, young and old alike, shall devote themselves diligently. The establishment of schools for sages is the foundation of governing the country and the place where talent is nurtured. All paths of literature and martial arts emerge from here. Since the children of samurai will particularly be involved in government affairs in the future, they should especially attend the academy from childhood and devote themselves particularly to learning. This path is based on loyalty and filial piety, clarifying the relationships between lord and retainer, father and son, elder and younger brothers, and senior and junior. It encompasses gathering the people, issuing commands, calculating income and expenditure, caring for the nation's water and drought preparedness, methods of loving people and benefiting the populace—all of these are studied in this academy. Additionally, banquets, caring for elders, archery competitions, and all matters related to ceremonial law are learned. Through this study, one naturally develops understanding, abandons evil and embraces good, bringing peace to parents and great benefit to the lord. Loyalty and filial piety respond like echoes to sound and reflect forms like water—their subtleties are clear. Currently, young students should first focus on reading aloud in the academy. As they mature, they will gradually absorb the meaning through lectures and naturally come to understand. Beyond this, each person may pursue broad learning according to their aspirations. Various matters are being gradually reformed by His Lordship's will. Recently, supervisors have been appointed, and reading tutors attend from early morning. Everyone should not only pursue their own training but also maintain proper behavior when attending the academy. Teachers should care for students without favoritism and with utmost dedication. Daily attendance at lectures shall be recorded and submitted on the first of each month. Those who show exceptional diligence and advancement shall be reported at year-end as before. The following articles shall be read monthly to all attendees by the supervisors, and the provisions appearing at the end shall also be read monthly to the young students.

1. Those engaged in reading shall attend from 6:30 AM, hang their name tags in order of arrival, avoid confusion, bow once to the teacher, and read quietly. Upon finishing reading, bow once more and withdraw. When taking seats, regardless of social rank, teach in order of arrival. All movements should be conducted quietly, and...

"Passing through Yoshida's shops and arriving at a very long bridge. The bridge we cross now, having gradually grown old, is being rebuilt. Large timbers are being hauled and hewn round, and many craftsmen and people gather making a great commotion. People also gather on the bridge we now cross to watch this."

This is what is written. Indeed, at this time the bridge was certainly under construction, and though the passage is brief, it should be said to truly capture the essence of the situation.

Regarding this bridge construction, as I mentioned before, not only do good records remain in Funamachi, but Atsumi District Office also once conducted investigations based on official inquiries, so there is no shortage of material to discuss. However, I plan to either compile and present this specially at the end of this historical discourse or publish it as a chronological table, so for now I intend to limit myself to discussing these fragments.

One more thing I would like to mention here is that Funamachi district had long performed ferry services, and in return was granted exemption from land taxes. During Nagasuke's time, his retainer Sasano Mokuemon investigated these matters through the village headman of Funamachi and submitted a report to the domain's accounting office, which still remains today. Since this serves as reference material in various respects, I would like to present its full text below.

**Record of Funamachi Village Headman's Statement for Mikawa Province Yoshida Post Station**

Item: Regarding Funamachi, this was formerly like a riverbank with scattered dwellings, but when Lord Ikeda Sanzaemon became castle lord, he ordered strong embankments built, Funamachi became a proper town district, and we made our living operating boats. In the kanoe-ne year of Keichō [1600], during the Battle of Sekigahara, Castle Lord Sanzaemon ordered us to provide boat service. Record of boat service performed at that time:

Item: When Lord Toda Shinano-no-kami, castle lord of Tsu in Ise Province, traveled from Edo to his castle, we served with 23 boats for his sea crossing.

**Main Text:**
Item: When Lord Furuta Hyōbu, castle lord of Matsusaka in the same province, traveled from Edo to his castle, we served with 16 boats for sea crossing to Ōminato in Ise Province.

Item: When Lord Kuki Ōsumi-no-kami, castle lord of Toba in Shima Province, committed treason and his son Nagato-no-kami went up as a punitive force, we served with 36 boats for sea crossing to Anogaura in Ise Province.

Having thus served boat duties during turbulent times, Castle Lord Sanzaemon ordered us to continue boat service henceforth, and we have continued performing boat service with tax exemption, operating the harbor boats at this location until now.

In former years we are told we received official documents, but 55 years ago in the ne year of Kan'ei 13 [1636], due to great floods and tsunami, houses were destroyed and many people died. At that time documents were also washed away, so we no longer have the official papers.

Item: During imperial visits to Kyoto, we send 18 boats to Kuwana in Ise Province for service. At Tōko village, 1.5 ri upriver from here, we also perform pontoon bridge service.

Item: 26 years ago in the kinoto-mi year of Kanbun 5 [1665], when Lord Okano Magokurō went to Kii Province as imperial envoy, we performed sea crossing service from here to Matsuzakiura in Ise Province.

Item: From long ago until now, when floods block the highways, we provide ferry service within 20 chō from near the local bridge to Kosakai village, serving imperial envoys and relay messengers without delay. In the kanoe-saru year of Enpō 8 [1680], when floods and tsunami blocked the highway and Lord Tōdō Shume came up as imperial envoy, we performed ferry service to Kosakai village. We have frequently transported relay messengers. Last mi year [1689] in the 7th month, when floods damaged the local bridge and blocked the highway, we provided uninterrupted ferry crossing for 9 days. Since ancient times during floods, bamboo, trees, and timber drift against the bridge, so during each flood we station ourselves day and night by the bridge to remove them.

Item: During successive castle lords' repairs of castle stone walls, we provide boats as needed for transporting stones.

...Watanabe Jikyū of Ushikubo. These people appear to have been geographical and historical researchers of this region at that time. As I mentioned at the beginning of this historical discourse, the record titled "Makino Family Genealogical Records" preserved in the house of Makino Nariyuki was researched by both Sano Kenmotsu and Watanabe Jikyū at the family's request in Kyōhō 16 (1731). This book mainly investigates the ancestors of the Makino family, particularly from the time of Kohaku's castle construction through the deaths in battle of his son Nobushige and others, and contains much that serves as valuable reference material. It is regrettable that I cannot learn more about the biographies of these authors, but I would like to at least mention their names here on this occasion.

◎Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobuyoshi
As I mentioned in the previous chapter, Yoshida castle lord Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobunao died of illness while residing at Yoshida Castle in September of Meiwa 5 (1768), and on November 16th of the same year, his eldest son Nobuyoshi succeeded to the headship and inherited his father's domain.

Nobuyoshi's childhood name was Otonosuke. He was first appointed Kai-no-kami but changed to Izu-no-kami upon succeeding to the family headship. Born on August 11th of Genbun 2 (1737), he succeeded at age thirty-two, but served only slightly over one year before dying on June 22nd of Meiwa 7 (1770). Therefore there are truly few accomplishments to mention here, but during his time the domain returned the lands of Kamo village in Jōtō District of Tōtōmi Province and received in exchange five villages in Kamo District of Mikawa Province and Onma village plus one other village in Hōi District in May of Meiwa 7. Like his father from childhood, Nobuyoshi studied under Miura Chikukei and was well-versed in Japanese history and Chinese classics, being particularly skilled in martial arts. It is said he once test-fired a gun twenty times with twenty hits, and that target should still be preserved by the Ōkōchi family. He was also skilled in poetry and painting, leaving behind poetry collections and essays. His benevolent heart is shown by an incident when one of his retainers accidentally dropped his newly-made

...daishō swords from their rack in Nobuyoshi's room, damaging them. The retainer was truly mortified and honestly apologized for his carelessness, waiting only for punishment. However, Nobuyoshi did not severely blame him and commanded "Never speak of this to others," personally having the swords sent for repair through proper channels. The retainer was truly grateful and felt deeply apologetic, according to the written account of domain retainer Shibata Zenshin. These stories give us some insight into Nobuyoshi's character. Nobuyoshi's remains were also buried at Heirin Temple in Nohidome, Musashi Province, and he was given the posthumous name Jiun-in.

◎Matsudaira Nobuaki's Childhood
When Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobuyoshi died in June of Meiwa 7 (1770), he was succeeded as Yoshida castle lord by his eldest son Nobuaki. Nobuaki was born on February 10th of Hōreki 13 (1763), so he inherited the family headship at exactly age eight. However, this person was truly gifted by nature and already showed extraordinary ability from his youth. At that time he was called Harunojō and studied calligraphy under Mitsui Shinwa. He was such an excellent calligrapher that Shinwa, in great admiration, said "With all respect, your skill in the way of brush far exceeds what this old fool can achieve. Therefore I will lend you my seal - please use it," and offered his seal. Nobuaki found this amusing and stamped Shinwa's seal all over his own calligraphy. This came to be called "Izu-kō's Shinwa" and was greatly treasured. Even now the Ōkōchi family preserves calligraphy he wrote around age six. The home of Kaneko Yōhei in Honmachi, Toyohashi City also preserves a painting of Mount Fuji thought to have been painted when he was about eight, but all are so well-executed that they hardly seem the work of a child. He was also skilled in poetry and expert at seal carving. At that time it was precisely the reign of the tenth shogun Ieharu. As I mentioned in the previous chapter, the ninth shogun Ieshige was of quite indolent character, so public morals deteriorated and finances became increasingly impoverished, but in Hōreki 10 (1760) he retired and this Ieharu took over as Sei-i Taishōgun...

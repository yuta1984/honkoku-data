That night, the famous Torii Suneemon Katsuaki left the castle bearing his mission. He immediately went to serve as messenger to Ieyasu's camp, but the question of Ieyasu's location at this time has long been disputed. The Ministry of Education's national textbook for higher elementary reading initially stated this was Hamamatsu, but later revised editions changed it to Okazaki. The General Staff's "Japanese Military History" I mentioned earlier also similarly states it was Okazaki, but I have a different theory about this. The "Butoku Chronological Compilation" seems to suggest that on the fifteenth, Katsuaki went to Okazaki to meet Ieyasu, but then states that on the sixteenth, Ieyasu went out to Takarakawa to meet Nobunaga, where they had an audience and [Ieyasu] expressed gratitude for [Nobunaga's] military expedition. Since Takarakawa is naturally in Minami-Shitara District, before Noda, if Ieyasu had been at Okazaki on the fifteenth, he should have already met with Nobunaga at that time. To record that the following day he again went out specifically to Takarakawa to meet him seems quite unreasonable. Also, Tsusaka Kōshaku's biography of Katsuaki records this event as taking place at Yoshida, but my theory is nothing special - I simply place greater weight on the account in "Mikawa Monogatari." That is, in that same work, when Katsuaki was captured by the Takeda forces and in his final moments shouted in a loud voice to those in the castle, his words included:

"Nobunaga has advanced as far as Okazaki! The lord of the castle has advanced to Hachiman! The vanguard has firmly positioned itself at Ichinomiya Honogahara! Ieyasu and Nobuyasu have moved to Noda! Hold the castle firmly - within three days your fortune will be opened!"

I believe this is the truth. As I mentioned before, Katsuaki escaped from the castle on the night of the fourteenth, and I think he met with Ieyasu that very night at the Noda camp. Following Ieyasu's instructions, he immediately headed again toward Okazaki, so that late on the night of the fifteenth he met with Nobunaga there and reported the situation in the castle. The same "Mikawa Monogatari" states:

"Then Nobunaga advanced his forces, and the vanguard quickly took positions at Hachiman Ichinomiya Honogahara, the lord of the castle arrived at Okazaki,

and Nobunaga arrived at Chiryū. However, Nagashino Castle was under fierce attack and had become extremely pressed, so they secretly sent out a man named Torii Suneemon to see whether Nobunaga had advanced and report back. He easily left the castle and reported this matter to Ieyasu, who passed it on to Nobunaga. Nobunaga was greatly pleased and ordered word sent of his advance."

I think this truly reveals the full circumstances and more. However, the "Butoku Chronological Compilation" states, as I mentioned before, that at this time Katsuaki met with Ieyasu at Okazaki, yet conversely records that he met with Nobunaga at Ushikubo - this seems to me an unbelievable theory in terms of sequence. What sources the Ministry of Education's national reader and the General Staff's "Japanese Military History" relied upon to adopt the theory that both Ieyasu and Nobunaga were at Okazaki at this time - I think it would be inappropriate for someone of my shallow learning to criticize this and that, but considering Ieyasu's character and his career up to this point, he himself had faced off against the Takeda's great army at Yoshida until the seventh day, and when that great army withdrew toward Nagashino on the eighth, I believe he could not have remained ignorant that Nagashino had been completely surrounded from that day. Knowing this, to withdraw his troops to Okazaki without regard for the crisis facing those he relied upon as his right and left hands would be absolutely impossible. Therefore, as stated in the "Mikawa Monogatari" account I mentioned before, Ieyasu at that time immediately advanced from Yoshida to Noda intending to relieve Nagashino, but recognizing that rash action against the Takeda's large force was impossible, he hastily sent messengers to Nobunaga and held his position there until reinforcements could arrive - this must be the truth, I am convinced. The "Matsudaira-ki" also records the events of that time:

"Though Ieyasu prepared to provide relief with his forces alone, the Okudaira sent secret communications saying the Kōshū forces were too large, and battle with only one army would be dangerous. Please bring out Lord Nobunaga and quickly send relief - otherwise the castle's provisions will be exhausted and it will undoubtedly fall soon. Therefore on the tenth day of the fifth month, urgent messengers were sent to Nobunaga."

I think this truly captures the actual situation well. However, there is one theory here, and Ieyasu indeed...

...Bungo-no-kami Sukenori. This Sukenori's family was originally retainers of the Nijō family, and their original surname was Honjō. Their ancestor, a man named Inaba-no-kami Munesuke, was the younger brother of Keishōin, mother of the fifth Shogun Tsunayoshi, and had served Tsunayoshi since he was still in Tatebayashi, gradually rising in his favor. Initially he received only five hundred hyō of stipend rice, but eventually became a daimyo of fifty thousand koku. His son Munetoshi also served Tsunayoshi from an early age, and in September of Genroku 15 (1702) was granted an increase to seventy thousand koku and was enfeoffed as lord of Hamamatsu Castle in Enshū Province. Moreover, on March 23rd of Hōei 2 (1705), he was first granted the Matsudaira surname. His son was this very Sukenori. Sukenori was originally the youngest son of Sano Shinano-no-kami Katsuyoshi and was adopted into the Honjō family. His childhood name was Sutegorō, and he was initially also called Sōjun and Shijun. He inherited the family headship in Kyōhō 8 (1723), and in the second month of Kyōhō 14 (1729), as I mentioned before, was transferred from Hamamatsu Castle to this Yoshida. This man became a member of the sōjashū on April 12th of Kanpō 1 (1741), was promoted to junior fourth rank lower in December of Kan'en 1 (1748), and was appointed as Kyoto deputy on October 15th of Kan'en 2 (1749). At this time he was again transferred from Yoshida to Hamamatsu Castle in exchange with the Ōkōchi clan. He died in Kyoto on March 26th of Hōreki 2 (1752) at the age of fifty-three. This man was quite skilled at waka poetry and was also reasonably accomplished at painting.

Mr. Ueda Nanasaburō of Nishi-Toyota, Muro-Yoshida Village, Atsumi County, had ancestors who were purveyors to this Honjō family and came along when Sukenori was transferred from Hamamatsu to Yoshida, so he still possesses many of Sukenori's surviving writings and paintings. From these we can see that his paintings were done in the Kanō school style and were quite well executed. His waka poetry also shows excellent calligraphy that deserves appreciation.

Now, this Sukenori's residence at Yoshida was, as I mentioned before, from Kyōhō 14 to Kan'en 2, approximately twenty-one years. Regarding the events during this period, first Kyōhō (which lasted twenty years) became Genbun, Genbun (five years) became Kanpō, and Kanpō (three years) became Enkyō. On the first day of the ninth month of Enkyō 2, the eighth Shogun Yoshimune, called the restorer of the Tokugawa, retired of his own accord, and his son Ieshige succeeded him as Seii Taishōgun. Yoshimune resided in the Western Compound and was called Ōgosho, but seven years later, on June 20th of Hōreki 1 (1751), he passed away at the age of sixty-eight. There are still some matters regarding this Ieshige's reign that need to be mentioned...

...but I plan to discuss these matters gradually in later chapters, so I will omit them here. However, among the events that occurred in Yoshida during Sukenori's residence there, what most draws people's attention is the extremely frequent occurrence of fires. According to old records, first there was a fire in Nakashiba on December 30th of Kyōhō 17 (1732) that destroyed thirty-six houses. Since Nakashiba at that time was still truly a village and is even recorded as "Nakashiba Village" in the records, the loss of thirty-six houses in such a place could well be called a major fire. Next was the fire of December 24th of Genbun 1 (1736), which started in Fudagi-machi and destroyed fifty-nine houses. Then came the fire in Shinsen-machi on May 5th of Genbun 3 (1738), which destroyed nineteen houses. Next was the fire in Akumi on October 27th of Kanpō 2 (1742), which destroyed fourteen houses. Furthermore, on August 9th of Enkyō 3 (1746), there was a fire in Hōroku-machi and Kudari-machi (present-day Hanazono-chō) that destroyed forty-four houses. Then on December 6th of Kan'en 1 (1748), seven houses were destroyed in Tamachi-Seko, and on New Year's Day of Kan'en 2 (1749), twenty-four houses were again destroyed in Shinsen-machi. On the 16th of the same month and year, twenty-four houses were destroyed in Tamachi, which is present-day Minato-machi. I think fires continued quite frequently, but the domain lord provided relief to disaster victims each time with rice, wheat, and pine wood, and also lent money on annual installment plans. Moreover, later most of this money was written off and gifted to the borrowers.

As a result of these continuous fires, it was natural that some disaster victims fell into difficulty, but besides these disaster victims, there were also many people in the town at that time who had great difficulty making a living. The cause was needless to say not only due to fires, but the domain lord repeatedly lent money and grain to these townspeople for assistance. Not only that, but from facts such as exempting the charcoal transport tax that had once been collected and granting the transport tax collected from Takaashi Village to this Yoshida post station, we can clearly see that the residents of the post station at that time not only could not even dream of commercial and industrial development, but rather could barely endure the excessive corvée duties. Regarding this relief, previously...

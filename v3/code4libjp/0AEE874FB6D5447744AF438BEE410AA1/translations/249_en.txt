Finally, though anxious, came to accept that they would extend the signing period with Harris as much as possible, but if it became an unavoidable situation where there was no other choice, signing would be inevitable. At that time, Great Elder Ii's anguish was truly beyond description, but while this provided diplomatic relief on one hand, it became a cause for even greater domestic political turmoil on the other, which was truly an unavoidable situation.

Under these circumstances, the signing of the treaty with America inevitably had to be carried out on the 20th, and Great Elder Ii found himself in the position of taking full responsibility upon himself, so he immediately began post-event measures.

First, on the following 21st, he had the five Senior Councillors, including Hotta Bitchū-no-kami, jointly sign a letter to the Imperial Messengers, the Great Counselors Hirohashi and Madenokōji, with a separate letter attached explaining that while they should have signed the treaty only after receiving imperial permission, if they had missed the opportunity when foreign warships arrived in succession and followed the same path as Qing China, it would have been a great disaster, so they had no choice but to proceed with the expedient signing.

**Dismissal of Hotta Bitchū-no-kami and Matsudaira Iga-no-kami**
As a second measure, on the 22nd they sought to summon the daimyo to the castle to announce the unavoidable nature of the treaty signing, but apparently recognizing the need to first seek reconciliation with the daimyo, on the night of the 21st they suddenly barred Senior Councillor Matsudaira Iga-no-kami from entering the castle, and also barred Hotta Bitchū-no-kami from entering, with both soon receiving orders of dismissal.

Of course, there were various circumstances leading to this point, but I shall omit them here as there is no time for detailed description. In any case, I wish to mention that this represented a major upheaval in the shogunal council at the time.

**Manabe Noriatsu and Others Become Senior Councillors**
When the Great Elder finally made his announcement to the daimyo, matters became even more complicated, but on the 23rd there were new appointments to the Senior Council: Ōta Bingo-no-kami Michiatsu, Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami Noriatsu, and Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami Norimasa entered the cabinet. Among these, Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami was at that time the lord of Sabae in Echizen province, and as you know

**Main Text:**
**The Lords of Tayasu and Hitotsubashi Confront the Great Elder**
I would like to repeat here that he was the actual father of the current Yoshida domain lord Nobuhisa, but on that day the Lords of Tayasu and Hitotsubashi also came to the castle to confront Great Elder Ii face-to-face and severely criticize him for the treaty signing as a violation of imperial orders.

**Unscheduled Castle Visits by Mito Nariaki and Owari Yoshihiro**
On the following 24th, Mito Nariaki and Owari Yoshihiro also came together for an unscheduled castle visit and engaged in a great heated argument directly with Great Elder Ii regarding the violation of imperial orders.

This was because, as I have repeatedly mentioned in previous chapters, the shogunal succession issue had become entangled and made the foreign affairs problem even more difficult. Earlier, Great Elder Ii had decided to definitively announce that Kii Yoshitomi would become the heir, and on the 2nd of this month had already petitioned Kyoto for imperial permission, but the report of imperial permission finally arrived at the shogunate on the 23rd. Therefore, it was decided to make the announcement on the 25th, but when members of the Hitotsubashi faction learned of this, they made every effort to obstruct it, further heightening emotional conflict between the two factions.

**Kii Yoshitomi Announced as the Shogun's Heir**
However, the Great Elder was determined to carry out his conviction, and as planned, on the 25th he ordered all lords to come to the castle and announced at that gathering that Yoshitomi would become the shogun's heir. This finally settled the long-troubled succession issue, but behind the scenes it only increased the Hitotsubashi faction's indignation, which was unavoidable.

**Severe Punishment for Mito, Owari, and Echizen**
In such circumstances, Shogun Iesada was suffering from beriberi and appeared to be approaching death, but he personally instructed the Great Elder to severely reprimand the recent unscheduled castle visits by Mito and Owari. Regarding this measure, among the Senior Councillors only Kuze Yamato-no-kami opposed it and advocated postponement, but the Great Elder's initial opinion favored carrying it out immediately, so finally on July 5th severe punishment was imposed on the three—Mito Nariaki, Owari Yoshihiro, and Matsudaira Yoshinaga—ordering them into strict house confinement. This was indeed an unavoidable result of being in a "riding the tiger" situation, but this treatment of Tokugawa branch domains completely weakened the shogunate's own wings, so the momentum toward shogunal decline became even more pronounced at this point.

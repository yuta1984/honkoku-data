　　　　　　I cannot comply with the imperial court's instructions, so regardless of the purport of this directive, whatever commands may come, unless there are orders from the imperial court or new directives from the senior councilors, I have strictly instructed my retainers stationed there to drive away [foreign ships] without hesitation, not deferring to your directive. Therefore, please handle this as if your recent directive had not been issued. I write to inform you of this matter. End.
　　　　　　　　June 18th　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Matsudaira Sagami-no-kami
　　　　　　　　　To Matsudaira Izu-no-kami
　　　　　　　Furthermore, I hope that no further directives regarding these matters will be issued. End.

　　　　　　From this we can see that at that time the shogunate's authority had completely fallen to the ground, and directives from officials like the Osaka castle deputy were entirely ineffective. While Sagami-no-kami submitted such a protest to the Osaka castle deputy, he had already fired upon foreign ships on the 14th. Consequently, the shogunate was alarmed and immediately sent the following message via post relay under the joint names of the senior councilors to the Osaka castle deputy, which arrived in Osaka on the 24th of that month.

　　　　　　Regarding Matsudaira Sagami-no-kami firing upon foreign ships at his post along this coastal area: The matter of expelling foreigners is still under negotiation at Yokohama and has not reached a breakdown, so carelessly firing and opening hostilities would bring about national disgrace and is absolutely unacceptable. When relations finally break down, we will immediately issue orders, so until then everyone should handle matters peacefully as before. Of course, if they attack first, driving them away is acceptable, but natural agitation and confusion should be avoided. Carefully assess the situation of any attack, and only when you are certain of an actual attack should you drive them away as stated above. Ensure that no rash actions occur unless there is an actual attack.

　　　　　　With things having reached this point, the Osaka castle deputy was increasingly troubled about how to handle the situation, so on the 26th of that month he sent the following document to the senior councilors and awaited their guidance.

　　　　　　However, as I already reported in my previous correspondence, when the British ship anchored at Mount Mejirushi on the 14th, I quickly informed the town magistrate and inquired about the foreign ship's intentions. They requested coal, but since this area is not on regular foreign shipping routes, they would depart quickly. However, around the time when even their sails were no longer visible, Matsudaira Sagami-no-kami's guard forces fired two or three rounds from their position. I believe the facts differ somewhat from what was reported regarding the cannon fire. Nevertheless, if we carelessly fire upon foreign ships every time they enter port, this would naturally lead to opening hostilities and create serious incidents. Therefore, when Lord Kii made his inquiry earlier, I conveyed the guidance given in the written instructions to Sagami-no-kami and all others. However, messengers from Matsudaira Sagami-no-kami and Matsudaira Tosa-no-kami came and, having reviewed the directive, stated that it contradicted imperial orders and they could not comply, requesting its withdrawal.

　　　　　　I further advised them to follow the government's intentions, but they would not agree at all. While I was deliberating and worrying about this situation, as I submitted in my previous correspondence, the directive from the court transmitters on the 20th had already been communicated to domains in nearby coastal areas. After communicating the contents of the document recently issued, depending on their response, they may continue to invoke imperial edicts and make various claims as before, which puts pressure on my handling of the situation and, I humbly submit, causes me deep concern about coordination between the court and military government. I report these concerns and believe they should be handled accordingly, but there are deep concerns about whether the contents of your document might lead to opening hostilities. I have immediately communicated this to local officials and circulated copies to the domains for their information, but they will certainly report to Kyoto. I am greatly concerned about the inconvenience should the court transmitters issue strict orders to attack. I truthfully report the facts of the 14th in the attached document. I will exert every effort to ensure that attacks do not occur when foreign ships arrive in the future, but given that the domains are so committed to obeying imperial commands, unforeseen incidents may occur, which causes me deep concern. Therefore, I request your guidance as soon as possible.

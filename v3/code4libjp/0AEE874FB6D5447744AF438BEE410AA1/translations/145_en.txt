did not undertake such activities. Therefore, he never became widely known to the world, but when one thoroughly investigates his career, it becomes clear that he was a person of quite resolute character and the utmost diligence. He devoted his entire life to the study of military law and weaponry. The materials from this research remain in great quantity at the Ōkōchi house even today, and these materials are certainly of no small benefit both historically and academically. Particularly since Terutsuna, in his youth, accompanied the Shimabara campaign as I mentioned before and witnessed actual combat, his research was quite appropriate. To give one or two examples of what remains at the Ōkōchi house: there is armor that this Terutsuna used to test the power of bullets. That is, he experimented by shooting firearms at an iron breastplate to see how deeply the bullets would penetrate the iron armor. At the Shimabara campaign, firearms were of course used extensively, but among them, the enemy side, being in an advantageous position for foreign trade, probably had sharper weapons than our side. From these experiences, I think Terutsuna conducted considerable research on firearms. The current head of the Ōkōchi house, Lord Masatoshi, as you all know, is a brilliant graduate of Tokyo Imperial University and holds a degree in engineering, specializing in ordnance and currently serving as a university professor. Recently, I visited Lord Masatoshi in his university classroom and observed various aspects of his experiments. He was testing by packing sand into boxes made of one-inch pine boards and firing guns into them. Though the times are different from ancient to modern, it truly seemed like witnessing the heroic figure of his ancestor, and though it was by chance, I felt a kind of nostalgic sensation. This too could be called some kind of karmic connection. Now, Terutsuna also conducted various research on ammunition, and bamboo tubes he made by hand for measuring ammunition still remain today. He also established military laws and wrote them in his own hand, but what's interesting is his establishment of military songs. These were designed so that people could remember military laws by singing them pleasantly. Even more admirable is that this person researched medical treatments to be used in military camps. At that time, unlike today, there were no military doctors, and when doctors were occasionally brought along, they were quack Chinese medicine practitioners who were completely unsuitable for military forces.

There's no doubt about this. So Terutsuna seems to have deeply felt this problem and researched military camp medicines. Among these, there are not only prescriptions using "saffron," but the actual saffron is carefully wrapped in paper and preserved, still remaining in the bottom of boxes today. From today's perspective, saffron may not seem so precious, but even just about thirty years ago it was quite valued as an imported product. However, paying attention to this imported medicine 270-280 years ago was probably thanks to the Shimabara expedition, but I think it's a matter worthy of the greatest attention. In addition, there is a map of Japan drawn by Terutsuna himself, and not only the way angles are measured but the cartographic method is entirely Western, which is deeply significant. Besides this, there are studies of navigation, cavalry methods, and naval gunnery. Of course, these might seem primitive from today's perspective, but in any case he was truly a researcher of Western learning, and there remain handwritten records where he noted down Dutch words and added annotations. Even more interesting is that in those records, it's written that when the Dutch sent ships east and west, these two ships met each other after three years en route - that is, it takes six years to circumnavigate the world. **[Marginal note: Pioneer of Western learning and arts]** Terutsuna, who was already paying attention to these matters 270 years ago, was truly a pioneer of Western learning and arts in our country, and I think he is a person who deserves to be written in large letters in our nation's history of civilization without any hesitation.

Now, Terutsuna succeeded his father Nobutsuna as lord of Kawagoe Castle on the 18th day of the 4th month of Kanbun 2, but ten years after inheriting the family headship, he died on the 12th day of the 12th month of Kanbun 11 at the age of fifty-two. He was given the posthumous name Chikōin and buried at Heiruji Temple like his father and grandfather.

**Ōkōchi Nobuteru** Terutsuna had many children, but except for his fourth son Nobuteru and sixth son Terusada, the others were either daughters or died young. Nobuteru inherited his father's domain on the 9th day of the 2nd month of Kanbun 12, and Terusada later became the adopted son of his uncle Nobuoki. Nobuteru's childhood

**Ōkōchi Terusada** name was Kamechiyo, later called Haretsuna, and then changed again to Nobuteru. He was born on the 8th day of the 4th month of Manji 3. Kanbun

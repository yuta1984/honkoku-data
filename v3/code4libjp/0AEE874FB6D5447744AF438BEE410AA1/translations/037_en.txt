had been estranged for many years, but when Kiyoyasu invaded eastern Mikawa and defeated the Makino clan of Yoshida, he immediately pressed toward Tahara. However, since these were two houses with deep old friendship, peace was quickly restored through negotiations over sake, and Kiyoyasu returned to Yoshida after only three days. However, since all records describe this incident as the Tahara Toda surrendering at the sight of approaching forces, I previously used such language and it remains in my notes, but this is misleading language that I wish to correct here. Then in Tenbun 4, Kiyoyasu died suddenly, and after that there was civil war in the Matsudaira house, with Kiyoyasu's son Hirotada wandering in exile in other provinces and finally returning to his domain in the sixth year, as I mentioned before. In that year (374 years ago), Kinshichirō used strategy to drive out Makino Denbei, the defender of Yoshida Castle, and took his place. And in the tenth year, Yoshimitsu renovated Ninrengi Castle and established himself there, so the power of the Toda clan was restored in this region.

I would like to discuss again the matter of this Kinshichirō, who, as I mentioned before, is recorded in many books as Norimitsu's second son, but somehow no person called Kinshichirō appears as Norimitsu's second son in the genealogies. Works like the "Study of Yoshida Castle Lords" suggest he might be Tachibana Shichirō Nobushige, but only the Hankanfu genealogy clearly identifies Nobushige as Kinshichirō. However, the Kansei Revised Family Genealogies record that Yasumitsu was called Kinshichirō. But this Kinshichirō could not possibly be Yasumitsu for logical reasons. Even regarding the person called Nobushige, there seem to be discrepancies since he died on June 18, Tenbun 10. However, the Chōya Kyūbun Hōkō states: "Kinshichirō was a relative of Toda Danjōchū Yasumitsu, lord of Tahara Castle in Atsumi District, so he probably defended this castle under Yasumitsu's command," which seems correct.

Now, things proceeded as described above, but in Tenbun 10, Yasumitsu's daughter married Matsudaira Hirotada, so the Toda house

and the Matsudaira house formed a marriage alliance. Of course, Hirotada had previously married the daughter of Mizuno Tadamasa, lord of Kariya Castle, and she bore Takechiyo, who later became Tokugawa Ieyasu. However, after Tadamasa's death, his son Nobumoto, despite being the brother of Hirotada's wife, broke with the Matsudaira house and allied with the Oda clan of Owari, which was their enemy at the time. So Hirotada became angry and finally divorced his wife from the Mizuno clan. This happened in Tenbun 13, and this Mizuno lady was quite a formidable woman who was later posthumously named Den'tsūin, and the Den'tsūin temple in Koishikawa, Tokyo was built in her honor. Yasumitsu's daughter married in her place and was called Tahara Gozen, but she bore no sons.

Under these circumstances, for some reason in the tenth month of Tenbun 15, Imagawa Yoshimoto sent Amano Aki-no-kami and others to attack Yoshida Castle and seize it from the Toda clan. This incident is of course recorded in the Hankanfu and other sources, but the Chōya Kyūbun Hōkō states:

"Tenth month: Toda Kinshichirō was residing in Yoshida Castle and belonged to the Imagawa house, but recently rebelled, so Lord Hirotada and Yoshimoto jointly launched an expedition to attack. At this time, Ishikawa Shikibu and Sakai Shōgen Chūga and others fought fiercely and the castle finally fell."

This indicates that the Matsudaira clan also assisted the Imagawa in attacking the Toda clan. The same theory is recorded in the "Study of Yoshida Castle Lords," so it appears that a rift had already developed between the Matsudaira and Toda clans by this time. When I explained the place name Yoshida earlier, I briefly mentioned a commendation letter from the Amano documents that Imagawa Yoshimoto gave to this Amano Aki-no-kami, namely "When Imahashi Castle's outpost was captured, to Ryōnenji..." This actually dates to this time and should serve as evidence for research, so despite the repetition, I will include the full text here:

"This time when the outpost of Imahashi Castle in Mikawa Province was captured, orders were given to relocate to Ryōnenji temple. Without objection, you rushed in at the very beginning and held firm positions, which is a great achievement and brings me great joy. On the 15th of this month at the hour of the dragon, when the outer fortifications of the same castle were breached, you rode into the dawn encampment, personally exerted every effort, and especially your relatives and retainers suffered wounds..."

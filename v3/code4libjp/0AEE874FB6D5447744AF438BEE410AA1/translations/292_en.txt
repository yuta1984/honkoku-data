　　　　　　suffered an unexpected major blow. At this time, Sanjō Sanetomi and the other seven court nobles fled from Kyoto, and the notification sent from Matsudaira Katamori, who was the Kyoto protector at the time, to Osaka castle deputy Nobuhisa was as follows:

　　　　　　Yesterday the Chōshū house was relieved of guarding the imperial palace gates, which caused indignation and the situation appeared to be escalating to armed conflict, but they strongly accepted the imperial command and immediately withdrew from the Fushimi area through this locality back to their home domain. I report this matter for your information. End.
　　　　　　　　August 19th　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Matsudaira Higo-no-kami
　　　　　　　　　　　To Matsudaira Izu-no-kami
　　　　　　　　Furthermore, I hear that Minister Sanjō also secretly withdrew together with the entire Chōshū group. End.

　　　　　　At that time, rumors spread that the Chōshū forces planned to withdraw from Kyoto, capture Osaka Castle, and use it as their base, so there was great vigilance in Osaka as well. A report remains from retainer Matsudaira Shume and official Miyata Tsunenoshin, who had gone to Kyoto to observe the situation and returned to Osaka. Since this gives us considerable insight into the circumstances of that time, I will excerpt it below as well.

　　　　　　1. Arrived in Kyoto at dawn on the 18th. Miyawaki Chūzaemon reported that on the 16th there was some disturbance within the imperial palace, the meaning of which was unclear. Suspecting that there might be some matter of concern for the castle deputy, and thinking that one person alone would be insufficient to handle the situation, I thought to call both men for consultation, but since yesterday morning it seems to have become quite peaceful. However, since I myself must go to Kyoto, I believe arrangements for the journey should be made. Various officials should be sent to Kyoto to investigate. Lodging arrangements should also be determined.

　　　　　　1. During this time, around 5 o'clock on the 18th there was disturbance within the imperial palace. What kind of matter it was unclear, but various investigations were conducted through Izu-no-kami's agents

　　　　　　　　　but nothing was learned. Around noon on the 19th, rumors arose that Sanjō-dono as commander with 20,000-30,000 men would capture Osaka Castle, so we were concerned until the evening of the 19th, but learned nothing. On the morning of the 20th, there was the Chōshū incident, and regarding this, it would be best to embark on the 21st, arrive in Kyoto on the 22nd, and then observe the situation. It would be best to send an official accompanying the chief retainer of Chūzaemon-dono, and there may also be a way to approach Higo-no-kami.

　　　　　　1. Court nobles came forth and spoke about the imperial expedition, saying that Chōshū domain planned to take advantage of the imperial absence to set fire to the palace and bring [someone] to Osaka Castle. In response, Satsuma and Aizu provided backing, fired blank shots within the palace to gather forces, and security was greatly strengthened. Chōshū was relieved of guarding the Sakai-machi gate, and all Chōshū forces withdrew.

Whether Chōshū's plans were actually as described in this report is naturally questionable, and I believe that at the time various rumors, gossip, and speculation were being discussed, but in any case, upon receiving such reports, Osaka also became greatly vigilant.

*{Marginal note: Report on the Totsukawa Incident}* Around that same time, another problem that arose in the Yamato region was the famous Totsukawa Incident. Regarding this, there were continuous reports to the Osaka castle deputy from the Sakai magistrate and other officials in related areas, so many such reports remain. Among those that serve as useful reference, one or two examples are as follows:

　　　　　　On the 17th around 7 PM, at the magistrate's office compound of Suzuki Gen'nai in Gojō district, 40-50 armed men carrying banners with the imperial chrysanthemum crest on scarlet cloth approached the front gate of Gen'nai's office and requested an audience. When a subordinate came out, they fired several rifle shots, took advantage of the confusion to storm in, beheaded Gen'nai, killed all the clerks, bound Gen'nai's wife, also bound an elderly clerk, then ransacked the property, examined all the records, selected useful items, called together the village headmen, and announced: "From now on this has become imperial territory, so understand accordingly. Therefore, annual taxes will be half of what they were before. Today's commander is Minister Nakayama." The person sitting respectfully on a camp stool said he was Minister Nakayama

He shaved his head, took the name Shōnyū, and later served Hideyoshi, residing at Ōgaki Castle in Mino Province, while his son Yukisuke held Gifu Castle. However, as I explained in detail in the previous chapter, at the Battle of Komaki they were ultimately defeated by Ieyasu and Nobuo, and Nobuteru died at age 49 and Yukisuke at age 26. At that time Terumasa was 21 years old and also participated in the campaign. However, on the advice of his retainers, he alone escaped and withdrew. Later he inherited his father's domain (according to the Okayama Ikeda Family Genealogy, he inherited his father's domain on the 28th day of the 4th month of Tenshō 12), and in Tenshō 13 he moved from Ōgaki to Gifu Castle (the same genealogy records this as happening in Tenshō 12, and notes that at this time he held 120,000 koku). From then on he constantly served Hideyoshi and achieved numerous military distinctions. In Tenshō 15 he was granted the Hashiba surname, and in the following year, Tenshō 16, 4th month, he was further granted the Toyotomi clan name. During the Odawara campaign he besieged Hayakawaguchi, and after its fall he headed to the conquest of Rikuū as the vanguard. Thus in that year, namely on the 13th day of the 7th month of Tenshō 18, he was transferred from Gifu to this region in place of Sakai Ietsugu, and was additionally granted the Ogurusu estate in Ise Province as funds for his residence in Kyoto - this is roughly the outline of his career. In that same year an uprising occurred in Mutsu, and Terumasa dispatched troops to assist Gamō Ujisato. This rebellion was soon pacified, and in the following year, Tenshō 19, Hideyoshi visited Terumasa's residence and bestowed various gifts, while Hidetsugu also presented him with a tea container, showing that his trust was quite deep. Thus Tenshō 20 became Bunroku 1, and in this year the famous Korean expedition began. Of course, Hideyoshi's intention at this time was to subjugate the Ming Dynasty, so if later generations call this campaign a "Korean expedition," Hideyoshi would probably chuckle in his grave. However, since it is generally known as the Korean expedition, I will provisionally refer to it as such. In this campaign, Terumasa received orders to return to Yoshida and was charged with defending the Kantō region, and also sent provisions to Nagoya in Bizen. This is recorded in the Kansei Revised Genealogies of Various Houses and other sources. Furthermore, in the 8th month of Bunroku 3, Terumasa welcomed Ieyasu's second daughter Princess Toku as his wife. As I mentioned before, this Princess Toku had initially married Hōjō Ujinao, but when she was delivered to Ieyasu's camp at the fall of Odawara, she was naturally divorced from Ujinao.

However, this time through Hideyoshi's mediation, she was married to Terumasa. Terumasa had previously married a daughter of Nakagawa Kiyohide and had a son named Toshitaka, but when this child died of illness, he welcomed Princess Toku afterward. There is an interesting anecdote about Princess Toku's wedding procession to Yoshida recorded in the "Bushō Kanjōki" (Military Commanders' Letters of Appreciation), which I think is quite fascinating, so I will excerpt it below:

Ikeda Sanzaemon-no-jō Terumasa's retainer Iba Sōbē was skilled in archery, superior to all marksmen in accuracy. When Terumasa made Yoshida in Sanshu his castle seat and became son-in-law to the Genji lord [Tokugawa], at the time of the wedding procession, various retainers went out to meet them at Imakire, and Iba carried a bow. The bride's attendant sent a messenger saying, "Among all these people, only one carries a bow - we have heard this must be Lord Iba, is that correct?" "Why do you ask? Yes, it is Iba," he replied. Again through a messenger they said, "Well then, there is a pair of white swans floating on this inlet - would you please shoot an arrow for us to watch?" Iba thought to himself, "What a difficult request - this should be avoided out of courtesy before the retainers of both houses," but said aloud, "I understand," and notched an arrow and stepped forward. The distance was about thirty ken, so the white swans gradually moved out to the offing and grew distant. Iba drew his bow to full extension and held it rather long, making observers wonder what was happening, then released almost as if he had forgotten. The arrow pierced through the male's body and shot off the female's tail, causing both houses' retainers to praise him with voices that echoed over the sea waves. The person who had made the request took both the arrow and the white swans and returned. When Iba's friend asked why he had delayed so long before shooting such an easy shot, he replied, "I wanted to shoot the pair together if possible, so I waited for them to align, but they never did align properly. When they seemed to align slightly, I took the opportunity and shot, so I regret not being able to take the pair together." Iba competed with firearms, and in shooting small birds with arrows and bullets out of ten attempts, he never lost. When he placed his left fist against bundled large straw targets and shot with an ordinary bow, he could penetrate backing boards about one inch thick. When his release was particularly good, the bowstring would snap cleanly from the force. He would pile up ash, stand pottery vessels as targets, and shoot through them without breaking the pottery - this too happened frequently. When shooting birds, he would set his bow, walk smoothly toward them, and when they were about to take flight, he would release while still walking without stopping his feet, and rarely missed. He was a man of great strength and robust build, known to people of his time.

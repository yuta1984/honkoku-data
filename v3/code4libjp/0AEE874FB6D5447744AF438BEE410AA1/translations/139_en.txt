Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (The Ōkōchi Clan and Its Ancestors) 250

However, his mother carried him and fled to Nakajima in Bishū, later moving to and hiding in Ōkōchi-gō in Nukata District, Mikawa. Thus, after Akitsuna came of age, he first called himself Ōkōchi Genta. However, this Ōkōchi-gō has long been a matter of considerable doubt, so in Nobutoki's self-compiled Ōkōchi family genealogy, it states that there are remains of the Ōkōchi residence in Nishi-Naganawa Village, Hazu District, Mikawa Province, but conversely in Nukata District, the location of Ōkōchi-gō is unclear - it is only handed down as being a neighboring village to Nakane and Ōhashi villages, with nothing reliable to go on. Akitsuna's son was Masaaki, his son was Yukishige, then came Munetsuna, Sadatsuna, Mitsumasa, Kunitsuna, Sanetsuna, Nobumasa, Nobusada, Hidetsuna, and Hisatsuna in succession, and Hisatsuna's son was the aforementioned Nobutsuna. However, there are various questions about this lineage too, but in Nobutoki's self-compiled genealogy, after much research and investigation, it is determined as above.

The Ōkōchi clan lineage is roughly as described above, but what kind of person was Akitsuna, who first took the Ōkōchi surname? This person, after coming of age, belonged to Ashikaga Yoshiuji and became his retainer. This Ashikaga Yoshiuji, as you may know, was the grandson of Yoshiyasu, founder of the Ashikaga clan, and his father was Yoshikane. Later becoming Minamoto Yoritomo's son-in-law, he gained considerable influence in the Kantō region in addition to his noble status, and held the position of jitō (estate steward) of Kira-shō in Mikawa Province. The Kira-shō of that time can be seen as almost the entire area of present-day Hazu District. Yoshiuji's eldest son Nagauji was sickly, so the family headship passed to his younger brother Yasuuji, while he retired to this Kira-shō and resided in Saijō. Saijō is the area around present-day Nishio town, and this was the origin of the Kira clan. Consequently, the Ōkōchi clan became hereditary retainers of the Kira family from this time. Akitsuna died of illness on the 20th day of the 10th month of Kanki 2 at age 52, which was exactly when Nagauji was 19 years old. However, it is somewhat unclear whether this was after Nagauji had already taken up residence in Mikawa, but Akitsuna's son Masaaki served under this Nagauji and held the territories of Teratsu and Ehara villages in Hazu District.

This person was called Mokuno-suke and died in Kōan 9 at age 86, taking the Buddhist name Entsū. His younger brother was called Sadaaki and held the title Saemon-jō. He was the founder of the so-called Naganawa Ōkōchi clan. The Ōkōchi clan members gradually spread throughout this region thereafter, branching into various lines including the Ōkōchi of Akiike, Kubota, Sugi, Fusechō, and others. Besides these, there was also the Ōkōchi of Momoi, but this lineage has long been somewhat questionable - while they are undoubtedly of Genji origin, it is unclear whether they are truly of Kanetsuna's bloodline. In any case, this Momoi line is well known through the Namiai-ki, but since that record itself is questionable, it cannot be relied upon. However, this Momoi line produced quite famous figures. The one called Kayōin, who was Kiyoyasu's final wife and Ieyasu's grandmother, was the adopted daughter of this Momoi Ōkōchi Mototsuna. She first married Mizuno Tadamasa and bore a daughter, then after separation married Kiyoyasu. Moreover, this daughter later became the wife of Hirotada (son of Kiyoyasu's previous wife from the Aoki clan) and bore Ieyasu, and this woman was the oft-mentioned Dentsūin. After remarrying Kiyoyasu, Kayōin bore another daughter, and I believe this daughter was the one who later married Sakai Tadatsugu, known as Lady Kōju. If this is so, then the portrait of the mother mentioned earlier, donated by Tadatsugu's wife and kept at Ryūnenji Temple in Yoshiya in our city, is entirely a portrait of this Kayōin, which I believe without doubt. Considering both the facial features and the comparison with Kiyoyasu's portrait at Zuinenji in Okazaki, I am confident this is an accurate identification. Also, among Mototsuna's grandsons was one called Ōkōchi Genzaburō Masatada, whose biography is also truly worth telling. In Tenshō 2, when Takeda Katsuyori attacked Takatenjin Castle in Tōtōmi, Ieyasu's defending general Ogasawara Yohachirou Nagatada ultimately could not hold out and surrendered to Katsuyori, but this Ōkōchi Masatada, who served as military inspector, alone refused to surrender. Katsuyori became angry and imprisoned him in a stone dungeon behind the castle, but Masatada to the very end...

Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (The General Situation After Senior Councilor Ii's Assassination and Nobutaka's Appointment as Osaka Castle Keeper) 518

**Main Text:**
Rumors spread that [Senior Councilor Ando] had plans to depose the Emperor. These matters also became a cause, and on January 15th of Bunkyu 2, Senior Councilor Ando was attacked by ronin outside Sakashita Gate when going to the castle. Fortunately, he was only wounded in the waist and managed to escape with his life, but since such an incident had occurred, various difficult circumstances arose and Senior Councilor Ando ultimately could not achieve his original intentions and was soon dismissed. Around this time, Honda Tadatami, Mizuno Tadayoshi, Itakura Katsutatsu and others joined the ranks of senior councilors, but the hearts of people both within and without became increasingly fearful and suspicious, making it completely impossible to reinvigorate shogunal government. The situation became one of merely passing each day through procrastination and temporizing measures. Under these circumstances, the world increasingly became dominated by the rampage of the loyalist expulsion party, and in Kyoto plans were finally made for Imperial Envoy Ohara Sanmi to go east. Of course, there are many details to this incident if one were to discuss it fully. However, speaking only of the main points, at that time there had been discussion of sending Iwakura Chunagon as this imperial envoy, but since there were circumstances making it difficult for him to leave Kyoto, Ohara Sanmi Shigenori, who had the foremost reputation for integrity, received this command. At that time, Shimazu Saburo Hisamitsu of Satsuma Domain, since the domain lord Tadayoshi was young, received permission to go to Edo in his place, and in the fourth month of Bunkyu 2, he entered Kyoto en route. He engaged in persuasion and mediation among the Konoe family and other Kyoto court nobles, received imperial command, and suppressed radical activists at Fushimi. This was the famous Teradaya Incident. In such circumstances, the court commanded the senior councilor of the time, Kuze Yamato-no-kami, to come to Kyoto. However, since Yamato-no-kami considered this journey to Kyoto very dangerous, he made various excuses and delayed his departure, so it was decided that an imperial envoy should be sent from the capital instead. Thus Shimazu Hisamitsu, who was in Kyoto, was appointed as vice-envoy to go east, but the shogunate, learning of this situation, followed the previous imperial command and first granted amnesty to Yoshinobu, Yoshinaga and others. On May 7th, all three lords went to the castle and had audience with the shogun, and Yoshinaga was commanded to thereafter occasionally visit the castle and participate in political consultations. And Senior Councilor Kuze...

...was relieved of his post due to illness on June 2nd, but Imperial Envoy Ohara's party finally arrived at the capital on the 7th of that month, had audience on the 10th, met personally with the shogun, and transmitted the imperial message. This imperial message, as you all know, was not short, but it contained the famous "Three Policies." The first was that the shogun should personally go to Kyoto, govern the nation, expel the barbarians, above console the wrath of the ancestral gods, and below establish the foundation for nurturing all people. The second was to designate five major coastal domains as the Five Great Elders, consult on national policy, strengthen coastal military preparations, and surely accomplish the work of expelling foreigners. The third was to have Hitotsubashi Yoshinobu assist the shogun and appoint Matsudaira Yoshinaga to the position of Great Elder. Of course, the shogunate had already generally decided internally on the matter of the shogun going to Kyoto and employing Yoshinobu and Yoshinaga, so although there were various circumstances, they ultimately decided to comply with the imperial command, and on July 1st the shogun met with the imperial envoy and presented a written response. However, viewed from outside, regarding this matter all three policies were things the shogunate did not welcome, nothing was according to their wishes, but they were merely pressed by imperial will and feared the power of Shimazu, so they had no choice but to submit - such was the appearance of the situation. Moreover, even if the shogun were to go to Kyoto, it would not be for determining national policy but for discussing strategies for expelling foreigners, so the shogunate increasingly lost prestige and found itself in an even more difficult position. In any case, the general trend was to urge Yoshinobu and Yoshinaga to take charge of government, and on July 6th Yoshinobu had audience with the imperial envoy and accepted the position of shogunal regent, while Yoshinaga was appointed to the office of Chief of Political Affairs on the 9th of that month. Yoshida Domain Lord Nobutaka, on June 30th of this year - just over one month before Yoshinobu and others took charge of government - replaced Matsudaira Hoki-no-kami Munehide as Osaka Castle Keeper and was raised to Fourth Court Rank. Imperial Envoy Ohara Sanmi, who had come east this time, on July 23rd summoned both Yoshinobu and Yoshinaga to his residence, with Shimazu Hisamitsu also present, and made several demands. Moreover, as the third requirement, since Osaka Castle Keeper Matsudaira Izu-no-kami (Nobutaka) was the son of Manabe Shimofusa-no-kami, he was unsuitable to public sentiment, and therefore should be dismissed...

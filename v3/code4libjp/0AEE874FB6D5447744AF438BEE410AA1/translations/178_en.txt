Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Nobuaki's Resignation as Senior Councilor) 328

**Main Text:**
...declining toward such a state, but because he was looked up to as a pillar of the nation with the hopes of ten thousand people relying on him, they had been enduring day by day. However, should some unexpected incident occur, it would easily lead to what is called "stepping on frost and reaching solid ice," with no telling how far it might go. From this point, it would be inevitable to advance toward a situation where the way of gentlemen disappears and the way of small men flourishes. Truly, nothing is more fearful than changes in human affairs compared to natural disasters and earthly calamities. Those with aspirations have no choice but to steel their resolve in their hearts, wondering if some great catastrophe might not occur.

Now, since Your Excellency is still rich in years, even after retirement you will undoubtedly think of national affairs morning and evening, so please focus primarily on maintaining your health. The advance and retreat, the coming forth and withdrawal of great men are fundamentally all for the sake of the world and the nation. To think of one's body as one's own possession could be called a narrow view. Since ancient times, those who take responsibility upon themselves have cherished their bodies and waited for the right moment. Even in times of peace, there may come times when one must sacrifice oneself for the nation and sovereign. I repeatedly urge you to put self-care first. Since I cannot remain silent about what is in my heart, I must speak, but please burn this letter yourself. Also, there are reasons I must avoid suspicion at this time and cannot visit, but when spring comes I would like to come see you."

This is roughly the gist of that letter. Of course, Jussai had no need to deliberately flatter Nobuaki after his resignation, and judging particularly from the literary style, it was truly filled with passionate sincerity. There is no doubt that this represented Jussai's true feelings throughout, but I believe this actually represented what could be called public opinion among intellectuals at the time. Jussai again sent another letter to Nobuaki a year later. This letter also fortunately remains in the Ōkōchi family. The gist of it was as follows:

"Time passes quickly - a year has gone by in the blink of an eye, but you have still not returned to service. I very much hope you will return to duty soon. Since ancient times, even the good government and fine achievements painstakingly constructed by wise ministers and good advisors tend to be abandoned when petty men take over, as they hate the person and therefore destroy even their works. There are many such examples throughout history, so at this time Your Excellency's personal advance or retirement greatly affects the nation. The peaceful times of today resulted from your reforms, but while it takes a hundred years to build something, it can be destroyed in a single morning..."

"...It would be regrettable to carelessly put flaws in this golden basin of a realm. Please quickly return to office again and help maintain this realm."

This was the meaning by which he earnestly urged Nobuaki's return to service.

Nobuaki sent a reply to this letter, but unfortunately it is not clear what he answered. However, Jussai sent yet another detailed letter repeatedly expressing his reasons for earnestly hoping for Nobuaki's return to service. This letter also remains in the Ōkōchi family today, but since it is quite lengthy, I will not describe it in detail here. In any case, I think this proves that Nobuaki's resignation was deeply regretted by intellectuals at the time, and his return to service was truly the hope of the people. However, as I mentioned before, various circumstances intervened regarding Nobuaki's resignation, so even if Nobuaki himself thought that the affairs of the realm could not be settled unless he returned, it ultimately could not proceed as he wished.

**Nobuaki and Waka Poetry**

"Returning to the village at the foot of Mount Kurai, a peaceful spring has come to my heart" - this was a poem Nobuaki composed in the first month of Bunka 1, the year after his resignation. After his resignation, Nobuaki became temporarily idle and appears to have frequently practiced waka poetry. As I mentioned before, this person was famous from childhood for his excellent calligraphy, skill at poetry, and ability at seal carving, but his earnest study of waka poetry seems to have occurred particularly during this period. He requested corrections from Former Middle Counselor Shibayama Mochitoyō, and the poem:

"The valley door cannot open through the layered clouds - a dwelling of long summer nights in the rainy season"

was considered excellent, so the court nobles called Nobuaki "the Rainy Season Chamberlain."

**Nobuaki Returns to His Domain**

In the fourth month of Bunka 2, his wife from the Inoue family passed away, and from the sixth month of the same year he was permitted to return to his domain. He departed Edo on the 21st day and on the 27th...

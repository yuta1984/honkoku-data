Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobutaka) 400

**Main Text:**
1. It has been heard that during Buddhist ceremonies, some serve sake under the names of "naka-sake" or "tea." Henceforth, such practices should be avoided.

The above shall be communicated to all retainers as instructed by Lord Hajime. You should understand this meaning. Those with group supervision responsibilities should strictly enforce this directive. Should anyone violate these articles, foot inspectors and lower inspectors have been instructed to report immediately upon hearing of such cases, so please be aware of this.

From this circular, it appears that at that time there was a restriction limiting kite-flying to only the month of January. As you know, in the Kantō region, kites are invariably flown in January, but in our Toyohashi region, they have traditionally been flown during the May festival. However, issuing a directive at this time to limit it to January like in Kantō is extremely interesting from the perspective of folk custom research. Nevertheless, this also appears to have ultimately been unenforceable, and the fact that even today our region still flies kites in the lunar fifth month creates an even more interesting impression. The difficulty of easily changing folk customs and habits is truly beyond expectation.

**Anecdotes of Nobutaka**

Regarding Nobutaka's character and conduct, there are records in the "Jūsei Ijishō" (Ten Generations' Anecdotal Records), and he appears to have greatly resembled his grandfather Nobuaki. If this person had fortunately lived to a natural age and not died young, he probably would have achieved considerable renown following Nobuaki. I shall relate two or three of his anecdotes as follows:

This occurred when Nobutaka had not yet inherited the family headship and was still called Hayato-no-shō. Once, when he had gone to the castle and was at his assigned seat, Senior Councilor Mizuno Echizen-no-kami Tadakuni happened to be arriving at the castle and passed in front of the assigned seating area. At that time, all those in the assigned seats bowed deeply in respect, but Nobutaka alone merely showed an attitude of respectful attention and did not bow deeply.

Seeing this, after Echizen-no-kami entered his waiting room, he had a tea servant named So-and-so inquire of Nobutaka about the previous incident: "Why do the others all bow deeply while you alone do not do so?" The tea servant was truly anxious, wondering what would happen, but Nobutaka answered without showing any sign of alarm: "Your suspicion is quite reasonable, but according to what I constantly hear from my father, even during the time when my grandfather Nobuaki served as senior councilor, in such cases the attending retainers would merely express respect through a respectful attitude and were not required to bow deeply in silent reverence. Or has there been some recent regulation regarding such matters, or is there some separate ancient precedent? I respectfully request your instruction." Echizen-no-kami had no grounds for complaint and let the matter pass, but similar incidents occurred frequently thereafter, so Echizen-no-kami would always laugh and say, "Hayato-no-shō's logical arguments are formidable, but small peppers are still spicy."

Thus, while he was upright and firm, he was also quite clever, and he was also extremely filial. When his father Nobuyori became ill, he deeply grieved and, consulting with the family temple Heirinji, together with its head priest's wife Keisōin (adopted daughter of Abe Masahiro), he personally copied the Kongō Jumyō Darani Sutra, had it carved, and distributed it to all the retainers, praying for his father's recovery.

In sum, this person's early death was truly regrettable, and since he had no natural children, it was decided that a son of Matsudaira Hyōbu from the clan would inherit the house.

**⦿Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobuaki and His Era**

**Matsudaira Nobuaki**

As stated in the previous chapter, Yoshida Castle lord Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobutaka died of illness on October 17, Tenpō 15 (Kōka 1) at the young age of only twenty-one. Unfortunately, since he had no children, Nobuaki, son of the clan member Matsudaira (Ōkōchi) Hyōbu Masatoshi, was welcomed as heir, and on December 29 of the same year he was commanded to inherit the domain. This Nobuaki had the childhood name Ken—

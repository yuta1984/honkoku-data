was in effect, so they not only immediately opened fire on it, but also showed considerable contempt upon seeing that it was unarmed. At this time, the American ship tried various methods to demonstrate its peaceful intentions, but was sternly rejected by our country's shogunate officials and finally had to leave Uraga. Later, this American ship called at Kagoshima on August 20th, but was also refused there, so it hastily departed for Macao.

However, in the following year, Tenpō 9, when the Dutch captain submitted to the shogunate a report stating that Morrison would come to our country, this immediately became a major issue. In fact, Morrison was the name of an American ship that, as mentioned earlier, had already come to our country the previous year and departed without achieving its purpose. However, our country had no way of knowing that the ship that had come to Uraga the previous year was that Morrison, and particularly because the Dutch report described this Morrison as a British ship, the Dutch scholars of that time believed it was the Oriental scholar Robert Morrison, who was residing in China, being sent by Britain as an envoy to our country, and they became greatly concerned about the impropriety of expelling such a mission.

The persecution of Watanabe Kazan, Takano Chōei, and others actually originated from this cause, but looking back from today's perspective, I think it was truly regrettable that such factual misunderstandings led to the persecution of so many people.

Later, in Kōka 2, an American whaling ship came to Uraga, and while the Japanese castaways it brought were received under special consideration, all weapons were confiscated and it departed in disgrace. Around this time, the American government decided to dispatch a powerful fleet to Chinese waters to protect the interests of its nationals residing in East Asia, but simultaneously ordered Commodore Biddle to test whether there was any prospect of having our country open its ports to foreign nations.

So Biddle came to Uraga on June 20th of Kaei 1 with two American warships, requesting the conclusion of a trade treaty, but this time too he was refused by the shogunate officials. However, at this time

the American ship showed an extremely peaceful attitude, allowing Japanese people to freely tour the ship and displaying considerable goodwill, but ultimately it ended in failure and had to depart empty-handed.

Then on March 25th of the following second year, when American Commodore Glynn came to Nagasaki to retrieve his country's castaways, his attitude was quite firm and no longer adhered solely to the previous peaceful approach. Finally, when Perry arrived in Kaei 6, he displayed the most forceful attitude of all.

The American president at the time was, as you know, Millard Fillmore, and arguments for urging our country to open its doors gradually became popular in that country. By 1850, this finally appeared in Congress as a resolution to increase the strength of their fleet in the East Indies and China Sea and attempt to open our country. Matthew Perry was newly appointed as commodore for this mission, and the president gave him a letter addressed to our shogun along with Perry's credentials to accomplish this mission.

So America first informed the Netherlands of this matter and requested appropriate assistance, which the Netherlands agreed to provide. The British Admiralty also showed favor toward this undertaking, supplying the latest nautical charts and providing guidance on routes to the East. The Netherlands then had the captain at Nagasaki inform our country of these circumstances and offer advice, but at that time in our country, many still thought of America as British territory, and generally did not consider that America was an independent great power in the world.

Moreover, recently they had begun to view the Netherlands with suspicion, so they paid little attention to this advice, but when Perry's arrival finally came, our shogunate's consternation was truly extreme.

Now, in America, after Congress decided on Perry's expedition, time was spent selecting warships, steamships, and the like.

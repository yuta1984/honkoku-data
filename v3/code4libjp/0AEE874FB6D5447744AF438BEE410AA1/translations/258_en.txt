...she inevitably adopted the second son of a branch family as her heir. Originally, Tohako's father Genkaku had entered the school of Lord Shibayama Mochitoyokyō to study waka poetry and had also become a disciple of Norinaga, so Tohako received his influence from childhood. Later she entered the school of Master Ōhira and associated not only with Nakayama Biseki but also with fellow disciples. Her works include "Sandai Chō Ruidai" in six volumes and "Tohako Yomigusa" in three volumes. "Sandai Chō Ruidai" was published in June of Bunsei 4 (1821), while "Tohako Yomigusa" was published in July of Bunkyū 1 (1861). Moreover, regarding these publications, she apparently struggled considerably with them. Tohako later fell ill and died at age 82, but there are still many fellow disciples worth mentioning. However, among them, the one I think must be introduced here is Hatano Takao, the founder of the famous Hata Library.

Takao's common name was Hitachi, later changed to Saeki, and he served as a Shinto priest at both Hata Shinmei and Hachiman shrines. He was actually the fourth son of Yamamoto Heisaburō Shigeyoshi of Nishigata village in Hōi district, but was later adopted and became the heir of Hatano Kazusa Takamichi, a Shinto priest of Hata. Since he died on June 1, Meiji 15 (1882) at age 85, this suggests he was born in Kansei 10 (1798). However, according to the biography of Takao written by Fukuha Misei, it records that Bunsei 10 (1827) was when he was 31 years old. If so, he would have to have been born in Kansei 9 (1797), but the same Fukuha biography also states his death year as Meiji 15 at age 85, so this must be an error where 31 should read 30 in Bunsei 10. Or perhaps he was actually born in Kansei 9, and the age 85 at death refers to his full years, making him 86 in traditional counting. This remains my question. Now, Takao loved reading from childhood and was absorbed in it whenever he had free time. He was once placed with a merchant family in Yoshida. However, since he was kept busy with household duties during the day, he would wait until night when people went to sleep and secretly begin reading. Then one time, Yoshida domain captured a thief and interrogated him about his crimes...

The thief said that he had once tried to break into a merchant house in Yoshida, but there was a young apprentice who studied earnestly every night until late, so he was unable to accomplish his purpose, but that was truly an admirable young man. When the domain officials gradually investigated, they found that this apprentice was indeed Takao, and this incident gradually became famous, which became the catalyst for his adoption into the Hatano family. Later, this Takao became a disciple of Motoori Ōhira, as I briefly mentioned in the previous chapter, though he was quite a late disciple for Ōhira. He soon inherited his father's position and also took over the Shinto priesthood, but on July 21, Bunsei 10 (1827), he further entered the school of Hirata Atsutane. At this time, Takao composed the following poems:

"Dividing through Kamiji mountain as I climb,
There are no clouds or mist to cover the heavenly sun's light.
The scenery of Kamiji mountain's small path leads without confusion—
It is truly the one straight true way."

Atsutane was said to be deeply pleased with these. At this time, Takao was 31 years old (or 30?), and Atsutane was 52. Of course, even before becoming Atsutane's disciple, Takao had deeply respected him and sought his teachings. Initially, he sent letters to Hirata Atsutane and through intermediaries sought Atsutane's instruction. Among the remaining correspondence, I think the following truly shows the relationship between Takao and Atsutane at the time, as well as their mutual characters, so I will present the full text here. The portions marked with circles in the text are places with vermillion writing in the original, added by Atsutane's own hand. The places marked with triangular points are believed to be additions by Atsutane, though of course these circles and triangular points are added by me for convenience and do not exist in the original. This letter was originally from Takao to Atsutane...

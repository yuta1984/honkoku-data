Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobuaki and His Era) 406

**Main Text:**
The shogunate's finances were impoverished, and on top of this, the construction of the western and main baileys continued, so tribute payments were frequently ordered from hereditary daimyo, which caused considerable distress. On the other hand, serving as a senior councilor (rōjū) as a hereditary daimyo was truly painful financially. The Ōkōchi family suffered considerable financial damage during the time when Nobutoki served as senior councilor, and later when Nobuaki held the senior position for a long time, they suffered extraordinary financial hardship. Considerable documentation from that time remains in the Ōkōchi family archives, and I believe these materials collectively came to reveal this dire situation. I plan to discuss the domain's finances in more detail at a later opportunity, so I would like to stop the discussion at this point.

Due to the circumstances described above, opinions were frequently solicited from retainers at that time. On August 28, Kaei 1, the following notice was issued again:

"Regarding His Lordship's conduct and anything that may not be beneficial, if anyone has noticed anything, no matter what it may be, please write it down, seal it, and put it in the box that will be circulated. Please submit it to the box by around the 3rd or 4th of next month (abbreviated)."

For this reason, retainers submitted various opinions as sealed memorials (fūji). However, soliciting such sealed memorials did not begin for the first time during Nobuaki's era - many sealed memorials submitted by retainers during Nobuaki's time are still preserved in the Ōkōchi family today. When Nobuaki died and Nobuyori succeeded, opinions from retainers were again solicited regarding finances, and more than ten sealed memorials submitted by retainers at that time are already preserved. Among these are some truly important documents for domain administration, so I would like to gradually investigate them and publish those that are necessary.

Next, I would like to move to discussing the personalities of that time. The domain administration was mainly controlled by senior retainers such as Wa-

...da Rihei and Nishimura Jiuemon. These two men not only have much to be recorded about them, but there were also quite remarkable figures among other retainers. However, as I have already mentioned before, I plan to discuss the organs of Yoshida domain administration separately at a later time, so I will speak in detail about the retainers who participated in these organs at that time. Therefore, I do not intend to cover that here, and would like to mention only the following one or two cases.

First, I would like to discuss three Chinese scholars: Ōta Seiken, Kaneko Keizan, and Murai Rakusho. Ōta Seiken, as mentioned before, was the third son of the famous Ōta Kinshiro. His given name was Atsushi, his courtesy name was Shukufuku, and his common name was Rozaburō. When Kinshiro returned to his home province of Kaga, Seiken remained in this domain by order of domain lord Nobuyori. He was an exceptionally gifted person who was already known in academic circles by the age of seventeen or eighteen. Moreover, he studied medicine under the Taki family and saved many people with his medical skills. Though he was not particularly skilled in calligraphy, he became respected in society as a scholar second only to his father, as I mentioned before. He lived until Meiji 6, dying on October 15 at age 79. He spent most of his time in Edo, serving as tutor to successive generations including Nobutaka and Nobuaki.

Kaneko Keizan was the respected father of Kaneko Kanae, current secretary of Toyohashi City. His given name was Kanae, his courtesy name was Gyokugen, his common name was Kumazō, later changed to Tasuke. He studied under Ichikawa Beian, Ōta Kinshiro, and Ogino Ryokuno, and was also a calligrapher. Initially he served Nobuyori and became a chamberlain, but from the time when his son Nobutaka was still heir apparent, he became his tutor and served as instructor. He died on November 11, Ansei 2, at age 49. His works include "Jūkakudō Zasshō."

Then there is Murai Rakusho, who was the respected father of Murai Gensai, already famous as a man of letters. His given name was Iki and his common name was Ariuemon. Born in Kansei 8, he also studied under Ogino Dairoku and his son Ryokuno. At the beginning of Tenpō he served Nobuyori and became an inspector, in the 8th year became tutor to heir apparent Nobutaka, became academic supervisor of the domain school Jishūkan, and served successive generations under Nobuaki, living until Meiji 3. "Rakusho Zasshō" twenty...

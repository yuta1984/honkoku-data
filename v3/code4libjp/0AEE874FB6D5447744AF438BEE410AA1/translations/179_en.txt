Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Nobuaki Again Appointed to Senior Office) 330

**Main Text:**
...arrived at this Yoshida, and from then lived in his domain, gathering his retainers and having them practice horsemanship daily, or trying his hand at fishing at sea, living in leisurely contentment. As I mentioned before, on the 28th day of the 12th month of that year, the aforementioned Chief Inspector Hisada Nuinodono-no-kami Nagakō was stripped of his position along with Tachibana Izumo-no-kami Tanenori and ordered into house arrest.

**House Arrest of Hisada and Tachibana**

Regarding the circumstances of this time, the True Record of Lord Bunkyōin states:

"On this day Tachibana Izumo-no-kami Tanenori was dismissed and ordered into house arrest. This was because, despite holding important official duties, he frequently met with persons of low station, and moreover conveyed matters of the inner palace or important affairs to those of the outer administration, eventually making various false statements - behavior deemed inappropriate and improper for his position. Also, Inspector Hisada Nuinodono-no-kami Nagakō was dismissed from his post, placed in the corps of minor construction officials, and ordered into confinement. This was because he carelessly allowed townspeople to come and go, discussed even important matters as casual conversation, was thoughtless regarding consultations with Tachibana Izumo-no-kami Tanenori, and furthermore believed unreliable information from townspeople, engaging in much biased and mistaken behavior. When questioned by sealed letter, he submitted an inadequate response, and was punished for these various improprieties."

I believe this represents the true situation. Therefore, one of the causes leading to Nobuaki's earlier resignation from the position of Senior Councilor was certainly related to dealings with these two men's faction.

Now that both men have met this fate, it was natural that Nobuaki should return to the world again.

**Nobuaki's Return to Office**

According to the Record of Lord Sugaku's Words and Deeds, Nobuaki himself anticipated that the time for his return to service would come, and indeed, on the 4th day of the 5th month of the following year, Bunka 3, an urgent summons from the shogunate arrived at Yoshida. The official letter from that time still remains in the Ōkōchi family today. The full text is as follows:

"There being official business for you, you are ordered to proceed to the capital. You should understand this matter. With fear and respect.

5th month, 4th day
                                        Aoyama Shimotsuke-no-kami
                                        Doi Ōi-no-kami  
                                        Makino Bizen-no-kami

To Lord Matsudaira Izu-no-kami

Furthermore, please prepare for departure within six or seven days. Travel urgently, not according to the usual daily pace. Keep your entourage small."

Thus Nobuaki immediately departed Yoshida and arrived at the capital on the 23rd day of the 5th month. On the 25th day he was ordered to return to office and furthermore commanded to take the highest seat. The circumstances of this time are also recorded in the True Record of Lord Bunkyōin as follows:

"25th day: This morning Aoyama Shimotsuke-no-kami Tadasu ke served as messenger to Lord Mito Chancellor Harunori, conveying that Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobuaki was commanded to join the council with the highest rank. Accordingly, this matter was communicated to those of court dress rank and above, with the senior councilors in attendance, through Makino Bizen-no-kami Tadakiyo. Also, because the Lord of Owari is still young, his house administrator was summoned and Bizen-no-kami Tadakiyo conveyed the message."

This shows it was quite a solemn affair. Also, at this time Nobuaki had an audience with Shogun Ienari and received some gracious words that moved him to tears, but the general criticism was that after Nobuaki's return to service, the shogun's favor somehow declined, and he himself tended to be reserved in all matters, focusing solely on maintaining peace. While this brought peace to the realm, his abilities were not fully displayed - rather, his true character was better seen during his previous tenure. However, I do not necessarily agree with such criticism. Rather, I firmly believe that after his return to service, he naturally relied less on Sadanobu's assistance and demonstrated his own abilities in many areas. I intend to gradually describe his achievements by picking out the main points.

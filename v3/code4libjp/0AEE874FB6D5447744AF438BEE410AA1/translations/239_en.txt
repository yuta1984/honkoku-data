Although they had come to adopt such views, they by no means approved of the shogunate's measures. On the contrary, they were great critics of the shogunate's actions. While other major outer daimyo also generally agreed with Yoshinaga and others on the surface, within their respective domains extremely heated debates took place.

*Subheading: Attitudes of Owari and Mito Domains*
Moreover, the attitudes of Owari and Mito domains, which were Tokugawa family branches at the time, deserve particular attention. Especially regarding Mito's Nariaki, as I mentioned earlier, he gradually came into conflict with the senior councilors of the time, with only Abe Ise-no-kami serving as a mediator barely maintaining the connection between them. However, Ise-no-kami died of illness on June 17th of Ansei 4, and from then on there was no prospect of harmony between the two parties. Furthermore, since the relationship between senior councilor Hotta Bitchu-no-kami and Nariaki was already strained, when Matsudaira Iga-no-kami rejoined the cabinet on September 13th of that year, it further aggravated Nariaki's feelings, leading him to harbor deep resentment toward the shogunate.

*Subheading: Death of Abe Ise-no-kami*
When the shogunate finally decided on Harris's castle audience and Bitchu-no-kami sent sealed letters dated August 15th to the three family branches of Owari, Kii, and Mito, Nariaki desperately wanted to prevent this. However, since the Lord of Kii was still young and not much of a consultation partner, he conspired with Owari's Yoshihiro to jointly present their opinions to the shogunate, but of course these were not heeded. He then sent his retainer Ando Yajiro to consult with Nakane Yukie, an advisor to Echizen lord Matsudaira Yoshinaga, but since the order had already been issued, there seemed little point in pursuing the matter further, so no response was given.

*Subheading: Nariaki's Kyoto Maneuvering*
Consequently, Nariaki, increasingly worried about the nation's future and unable to bear his resentment, finally began political maneuvering in Kyoto. As you know, Nariaki had matrimonial connections among the court nobility from the beginning, particularly with the wives of Nijo Narinobu and Takatsukasa Masamichi, both of whom were Nariaki's sisters. Through these connections, he sought to convey his opinions to the imperial court via these two houses, having already begun influencing the Takatsukasa house since the previous year.

However, such activities occasionally leaked out and became known to the shogunate, which naturally considered this a major incident given the political situation of the time. The shogunate frequently implemented countermeasures at court through the Kyoto deputy.

This time, Nariaki, unable to contain his indignation, secretly drafted a lengthy memorial and presented it to the Kujo regent. However, there is a theory that the memorial commonly circulated is entirely someone's forgery. Nevertheless, it is generally believed that Nariaki's opinions at the time were substantially similar to the main points of that memorial. The essential points were roughly as follows:

The Western barbarians entirely covet our territory and gradually seek to invade our country - this is their main objective. However, the shogunate's response to this is inappropriate. Officials cling to their positions and salaries, seeking only immediate comfort, deceived by the vulgar views of Dutch learning scholars, ultimately abandoning the brave and resolute spirit that has been our nation's traditional character. Therefore, if the court would only make a firm decision and issue an anti-foreign edict, the hearts of all people would immediately rise up to repay their debt to the nation.

Already certain domains are enthusiastically prepared to uphold imperial will at any time, and among the major and minor daimyo, a great majority do not submit to the shogunate's measures. Therefore, with a strict imperial command, we could fortunately rely on the united efforts of all daimyo to prevent this foreign barbarian's castle audience and eliminate this unprecedented national crisis.

Given such circumstances, it was natural that the imperial court, which had been suppressed for many years, gradually began to show more spirit. This was essentially the beginning of the complex situation developing between the court, the shogunate, and the feudal lords, ultimately becoming the starting point for the Meiji Restoration.

However, I believe the purpose of Western arrivals was not necessarily to invade our territory, but rather their main objective was commercial trade. Nevertheless, given our nation's ancestral laws, they initially sought to begin with friendship and port opening...

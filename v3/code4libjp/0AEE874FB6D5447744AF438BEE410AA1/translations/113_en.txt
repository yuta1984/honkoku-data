traveled frequently between [Edo and Osaka], stopping in Kyoto each time and receiving considerable favor from the imperial court. As mentioned earlier, Ikeda Terumasa's promotion from this territory to Banshu Himeji occurred in November of Keicho 5, and the one who was enfeoffed in his place and came to this Yoshida was none other than Matsudaira Genba-no-kami Ieyasu, which was announced in February of Keicho 6.

This Ieyasu was the grandson of Matsudaira Kiyoyoshi, whom I mentioned much earlier, and his father was a man named Kiyomune. As I mentioned before, when Ieyasu was transferred to the Kanto region in Tensho 18, he was enfeoffed with 10,000 koku at Hachimanyama in Musashi. This time, this Ieyasu was enfeoffed with 30,000 koku in this territory.

For these reasons, this was undoubtedly a very good thing both for the Matsudaira family and from the perspective of Ieyasu's policies. However, from the standpoint of our Toyohashi's development, it was quite unfortunate, as the various plans that Ikeda Terumasa with his 152,000 koku had set in motion came to a sudden halt when he was replaced by this small-stipend hereditary daimyo.

Moreover, even though there would be changes of domain lords thereafter, their policies remained essentially unchanged throughout the three hundred years of Tokugawa rule. Not only our Toyohashi, but all the castle towns along the Tokaido - except for places like Nagoya and Sunpu - were in the same situation, and truly never had good opportunities for territorial development. I believe this was quite an unfortunate matter from today's perspective.

Now, this Ieyasu's house was the so-called Takenoya Matsudaira clan, whose ancestor was Izumi-nyudo Nobumitsu, whom I have mentioned before. Thus they ultimately shared the same lineage as the Tokugawa clan. From Nobumitsu's second son Moriie to Kiyoyoshi, for about four generations, they resided at Okazaki Castle.

However, in Kiyoyoshi's generation, they moved to Takenoya and he took the name Takenoya Yojiro. His daughter had once been a hostage at this Yoshida Castle, and when Ieyasu broke with Imagawa Ujizane, she was brutally murdered by Obara Shigezane at the Ryunenji gate, as I have already described in that era.

Thereafter, this Kiyoyoshi devoted himself increasingly to loyal service for the Tokugawa clan. He died in Tensho 15 at the age of eighty-three, and his son Kiyomune succeeded him. Kiyomune was also granted territory in Totomi for his military achievements, so

Later, Ieyasu succeeded him and, together with his father Kiyomune, guarded Kokokuji Castle in Suruga. When Ieyasu was transferred to the Kanto region, as I mentioned before, he was enfeoffed with 10,000 koku at Hachimanyama in Musashi.

This Ieyasu was also initially called Yojiro and had many military achievements. During the Battle of Sekigahara, he guarded Kiyosu Castle in Owari, and this time was transferred to this Yoshida, with his territory becoming 30,000 koku - three times his previous holding.

However, when Ieyasu came to this Yoshida, since it had previously been 152,000 koku under Ikeda Terumasa's castle town, he probably did not recognize the need for immediate new planning, and it seems no significant achievements from such efforts remain. Therefore, regrettably, there is very little to describe here.

Now, as you all know, Ieyasu was finally appointed Sei-i Taishogun on February 12th of Keicho 8, thus gaining control of the realm's political power in both name and reality. At this time Ieyasu was sixty-two years old, but in April of the 10th year, he petitioned to transfer his military position to Hidetada and received imperial permission.

Therefore, he renovated Sunpu Castle and moved there in July of the 12th year, while Hidetada remained in Edo. Ieyasu frequently traveled between the two locations, serving as guardian to the shogun.

After two or three years in this manner, on December 21st of Keicho 15, this lord of Yoshida, Ieyasu, suddenly fell ill and died at the age of forty-five. His son Tadakiyo succeeded him, but Ieyasu's wife was Ieyasu's half-sister, and Tadakiyo was their son. However, this person also died on April 20th of Keicho 17, shortly after succession.

He was only twenty-eight years old, and unfortunately had no male heir, so his house was ultimately extinguished. However, the Tokugawa house specially granted his younger brother Shojiro Kiyomasa 5,000 koku in Nishi District to continue the line. Regarding this matter, there is the following record in the Keicho Kenbun-sho:

"Matsudaira Minbu-shosuke [Tadakiyo] has no children and no heir. There is a younger brother named Naiki's son, and also Minbu's younger brother Matsudaira Shojiro who serves in the Gosho-inban..."

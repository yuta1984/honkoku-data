These factors ultimately led Wakasa-no-kami to make his decision. The arrest of Umeda actually took place before Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami's arrival in Kyoto, and thus from Nagano's advocacy, the Ansei Purge unexpectedly began to unfold.

At this time, Great Elder Ii dispatched two or three additional spies besides Nagano Shuzen to Kyoto to investigate all activities. He came to recognize that the persuasive activities of these rōshi had sufficient power to greatly influence court deliberations, while also learning that Mito Nariaki's movements were truly the source of rising anti-shogunate sentiment. Of course, as mentioned from previous chapters, Nariaki's conduct had been extremely detrimental to the shogunate, but revealing such details to Kyoto would ultimately expose Kantō internal conflicts to the public, making this the greatest possible disadvantage. Therefore, even though the shogunate was somewhat aware of these circumstances, it had endured patiently until now. However, with the current situation, especially after Regent Kujō's resignation when no one remained to defend the shogunate, the shogunate could no longer let matters stand. Consequently, on September 13th, they formally lodged a complaint with the court regarding Nariaki's conduct.

**The Shogunate's Impeachment of Nariaki to the Court**

The essence of their complaint was that Nariaki, deeply resenting the failure of the heir designation matter, deliberately criticized shogunate policies and slandered the shogunate as fearing foreign barbarians while scorning imperial authority. However, when directly consulting him about his views, he had no fixed opinions on foreign relations and claimed that now was not the time to commence war, yet conversely he skillfully adorned his arguments before the court nobles to advocate for war—his words and actions completely contradicting each other. The court nobles, not deeply understanding these circumstances, seemed easily misled by Nariaki's false arguments. Under such conditions, national turmoil would immediately ensue, making it impossible to ease His Majesty's concerns. Therefore, they had temporarily ordered Nariaki's house confinement, but he showed no reflection and continued his persuasive activities in Kyoto.

This was utterly incomprehensible. This was clearly an impeaching memorial against Nariaki that the shogunate submitted to the court, marking the peak of the conflict between the shogunate and Mito domain. Having reached this state of affairs, tragic bloodshed would inevitably occur soon—truly an unstoppable situation like "riding a tiger."

Under these circumstances, coincidentally on September 13th, Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami arrived in Kanō in Mino province. At this time, he heard that an imperial decree had been issued in Kyoto pardoning Mito Nariaki's confinement and appointing Matsudaira Echizen-no-kami as Great Elder. This was completely false information, but in such circumstances, such reports provided serious provocation, and Shimōsa-no-kami's indignation upon hearing this was indeed severe.

**Shuzen Meets with Shimōsa-no-kami**

On the following 14th, when Shimōsa-no-kami arrived at Samegai that night, he met with Nagano Shuzen, who had secretly come from Ōtsu. Shuzen detailed Kyoto's situation and proposed that the immediate strategy should be to arrest the Mito domain's Kyoto caretakers, the Ukai father and son, punish them for their crime of receiving separate imperial orders on August 8th and departing eastward as previously mentioned, and thereby intimidate court nobles like Konoe and Sanjō. This immediately gained Shimōsa-no-kami's approval.

**Arrest of the Ukai Father and Son**

Upon reaching Ōtsu on the 16th, Shimōsa-no-kami immediately summoned Kyoto Town Magistrate Ogasawara Nagato-no-kami and secretly ordered the arrest of the Ukai father and son. Acting on this, Nagato-no-kami summoned both men to the magistrate's office several days later and ultimately detained them.

**Shimōsa-no-kami's Entry into Kyoto**

Thus Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami entered Kyoto on the 17th and took residence at Myōmanji temple. Originally, the shogunate's objective was to prevent Regent Kujō from losing his position and through him convey the shogunate's will to the Emperor, hopefully obtaining imperial permission for the treaties. However, given the situation as described, this objective could not be achieved through ordinary means. Moreover, the shogunate now needed to sweep away dissident elements in the court and eliminate their foundation.

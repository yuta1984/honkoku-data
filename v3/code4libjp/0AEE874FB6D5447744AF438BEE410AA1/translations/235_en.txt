Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Foreign Affairs Issues and Yoshida Domain) 442

**Main Text:**
If I do not speak up about matters that have come to my attention, it would be the height of disloyalty, so I humbly present my thoughts below.

First, in our domain, Lord Chikōin has conducted research on military law, artillery, and other equipment, which represents special circumstances, so there is nothing particular for me to mention. However, when times change, it is natural for all things to transform. Already in Japan, bows and arrows were the primary weapons in ancient times, but subsequently spears, firearms, and such were gradually developed, showing how things change through the ages. Recently, I have heard bit by bit that Western nations are becoming increasingly prosperous. Those countries make daily progress their specialty, with learning and arts gradually advancing. Particularly, since warfare has continued until recently, they have progressively reformed military tactics, artillery, and equipment based not on theoretical discussion but on practical experience, which I believe truly gets to the essence of things. Even though Lord Chikōin devised improvements, with all due respect, at that time there were no foreign barbarians, only conflicts among Japanese, so I wonder about preparations for coastal defense. Although he was a wise lord and would have made preparations, nearly two hundred years have passed, and while foreign countries have changed considerably, Japan has continued in peace without any reforms that I have heard of. Under such circumstances, I fear there might be inconveniences in case of emergency. For example, regarding ordinary sword and spear practice, if ancient-style swordsmanship were to compete with modern advanced swordsmanship, the modern techniques would be considerably superior. Similarly, the difference between ancient Japanese warfare and contemporary foreign warfare reflects the same principle as with swords and spears. Therefore, I believe we should thoroughly investigate not only the circumstances of those countries but also military law, artillery, equipment, and all related matters. Coastal defense truly relates to the safety and danger of our nation and is no trivial matter, so it represents the most urgent task both in relation to the authorities and to our domain. The government has established the Institute for the Investigation of Barbarian Books, borrowed about nine retainers, ordered the investigation of Dutch books, and appointed instruction in Dutch learning for direct retainers. Particularly last year, Dutch experts were summoned to Nagasaki, and direct retainers were assigned to learn Dutch studies, shipbuilding, navigation, artillery, mathematics, firearms drill, geography, and other subjects in various divisions. At the military academy, Western firearms drill takes place daily. Moreover, senior councilors frequently observe drills by Shimozuke and Egawa, showing this is a time of special promotion. Various houses are also gradually developing Western methods with great attention.

First, artillery is the primary requirement of military preparation. Foreign artillery developed during wartime; in some battles, transporting large cannons was hindered by great mountains and rivers, and in others, strong winds and rain extinguished matchlocks and scattered gunpowder, leading to abandoning matchlock guns for flintlocks, and recently inventing percussion cap guns. Sometimes convenient guns were used to overwhelm enemies in battles with various countries, or equipment was destroyed by powerful projectiles, leading to various hardships and improvements. Japanese artillery, having been transmitted from the Southern Barbarian countries and developed during peaceful times, naturally may be lacking in practical training. Under such circumstances, unexpected problems might arise in emergencies.

In other battles, great storms extinguished match cords and scattered gunpowder, leading to abandoning matchlock guns in favor of flintlocks, and recently inventing percussion cap guns. Sometimes convenient guns overwhelmed enemies in battles with various countries, or equipment was destroyed by powerful projectiles, leading to various hardships and improvements. Japanese artillery, transmitted from Southern Barbarian countries and developed during peaceful governance, may naturally be lacking in practical training. Under such circumstances, unexpected problems might arise in emergencies.

First, regarding armor: in ancient times during bow and arrow warfare, it would have been quite useful, but now that we have entered the age of firearm warfare, even against small guns, I believe it would be unreliable to deflect bullets. Moreover, it restricts maneuverability and tires the body, making it harmful rather than beneficial. For lower-ranking soldiers especially, being light and agile for free movement would be most practical.

First, regarding practical application: the authorities have repeatedly issued orders about this. While this goes without saying, I humbly believe it is essential to pay close attention to these two words "practical application" in all matters.

I deeply fear you might think I am too partial to Western ways. I reconsidered whether someone as young and presumptuous as myself should speak up on such matters, but being solely concerned with this great matter affecting our nation, I have expressed only the main points of my thoughts. Particularly since I am unlearned and cannot write well, there will surely be points you find questionable, so I would like to receive your inquiries about such matters.

The above.

Eleventh month of the year of the Dragon - Hozumi Seishichirō (seal)

There are many more things I would like to say about Seishichirō, but as this story progresses, they will naturally be discussed, so I will stop here and move to the next chapter.

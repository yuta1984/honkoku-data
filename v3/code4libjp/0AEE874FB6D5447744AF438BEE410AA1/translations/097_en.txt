...and 300 bu made one tan, with ten tan constituting one chō. However, due to long-standing customs, complete reform could not be accomplished immediately. In the Yoshida region, around the eleventh month of Tenshō 17 (1589), a person named Hikosaka Ko-gyōbu came and stayed for an extended period, conducting land surveys and also issuing proclamations about methods of tribute payment. Three documents from this Hikosaka Ko-gyōbu remain at Higashi Kannon Temple in Komatsubara today - two are letters addressed to the head priest of Higashi Kannon Temple, and one records the established regulations. All of these provide insight into the circumstances of that time and should serve as valuable references.

[Supplement: Regarding the Portrait Donated by Sakai Tadatsugu's Wife]
Earlier, in the section on "Sakai Tadatsugu and the Warriors of Eastern Mikawa," I briefly mentioned that a portrait of her mother, donated by Sakai Tadatsugu's wife, remains at Ryūnen Temple in Yoshiya, Toyohashi City. As I noted at that time, Tadatsugu's wife was known as Lady Kōju and was a daughter of Matsudaira Kiyoyasu, so this portrait is clearly of Kiyoyasu's wife. However, Kiyoyasu had three wives in succession. The first was the daughter of Matsudaira Danjō Saemon Nyūdō Masayasu. In Daiei 4 (1524), when Kiyoyasu was fourteen years old, he captured Masayasu Nyūdō's castle at Yamanaka and then attacked Okazaki Castle. Masayasu, finding resistance impossible, surrendered the castle, sued for peace, and gave his daughter Princess Haru in marriage to Kiyoyasu. However, there was marital discord, and Kiyoyasu later took the daughter of Aoki Chikugo-no-kami Sadakage as his wife, who bore Hirotada. This wife, however, suffered complications after childbirth and eventually died, so Kiyoyasu then took the adopted daughter of Ōkōuchi Saemon-no-jō Mototsuna as his third wife. From this, one can confidently conclude that Lady Kōju's mother was this person, though no definitive records exist to confirm this. Various theories about Mototsuna's adopted daughter have persisted, with folk tales relating various stories. It is believed factual that she first married Mizuno Tadamasa, divorced, and then married Kiyoyasu.

I believe this to be true. Many records state that the famous Dentsu-in - Mizuno Tadamasa's daughter who first became Hirotada's wife and gave birth to Ieyasu - was also this woman's child. Moreover, since this woman was renowned for her exceptional beauty, despite being four years older than Kiyoyasu, he earnestly desired her as his wife and married her through the arrangements of Okamoto Zenshichirō Hidenari, lord of Miya Castle in Owari Province. The Mikawa-shi contains a quite comprehensive account of this person, citing the Shōgun Gaiseki-den (Record of the Shogun's Maternal Relatives). According to this, she was named Lady Otomi and bore one daughter and one son after marrying Kiyoyasu. However, her adoptive father Ōkōuchi Mototsuna was of the Momoi branch of the Ōkōuchi lineage, and according to the genealogy preserved by the Ōkōuchi Viscount family, Mototsuna's adopted daughter was called Princess Mitsu, and there are often discrepancies in her biographical details with the account of Lady Otomi found in the Shōgun Gaiseki-den. Given these circumstances, I cannot yet provide a complete account, but in any case, I believe the portrait at Ryūnen Temple, judging from its appearance and various other factors, is undoubtedly of the person who was Mototsuna's adopted daughter and Kiyoyasu's final wife, as I have just described. This portrait is particularly worthy of viewing and retains its value as a precious artifact. Recently, I attended an educational exhibition held in Okazaki town and saw a portrait of Kiyoyasu displayed in the local historical materials section, contributed by Zuinen Temple of that town. This is said to be a portrait painted when Kiyoyasu had his dream of the character "ze" (是), so it is probably from when he was around twenty-three years old. Not only is it from the same period, but the artistic style is most similar to that of the lady's portrait preserved at Ryūnen Temple, leaving me with indescribable impressions. Although Kiyoyasu's portrait is considerably older and clearly not created at the same time, there doesn't seem to be a great difference in their periods, and they may even be by the same artist. Comparing these two works offers infinite fascination.

Of course, the boiling of public opinion was tremendous. Even people like Tsutsui and Kawaji, who acknowledged that opening the country was unavoidable, criticized the spinelessness of this Kanagawa Treaty compared to their own negotiations with Russian envoy Putiatin in Nagasaki. But looking back from today's perspective, this too was unavoidable given the momentum, and the circumstances at the time made it absolutely impossible to reject.

The American fleet's behavior was truly magnificent - presenting before our eyes numerous mountain-like warships that most of our countrymen had never even dreamed of. Moreover, the conduct and bearing of their officers and sailors was truly brave and solemn, and the excellence of their weapons made our countrymen realize they could not compare. They would fire salutes in succession, have their military bands perform, conduct soldier drills, and test fleet maneuvers - there was nothing they did that did not astonish our countrymen. Furthermore, they used models of trains and telegraph machines to demonstrate their ingenious technology, and presented paintings of the Mexican War to make viewers shudder at the horrific scenes - all of this was beyond our countrymen's imagination. Therefore, while I believe the shogunate officials initially intended to handle this according to the policies I mentioned earlier and somehow get through the immediate crisis, when things reached this point, our shogunate, having virtually no reliable military force to oppose them, could not reject their demands unless prepared to see the nation reduced to scorched earth. Ultimately, concluding a treaty of the level I described above was truly an unavoidable situation born of expedience.

This was actually the result of world progress finally bringing our country to this point, and no matter how resolute our Japanese warriors might be, ultimately they could not prevail against this global trend.

For these reasons the Japan-America Treaty of Friendship was concluded. Perry then left Kanagawa on March 21st and headed for Hakodate, but again came to Shimoda on May 12th, where he once more met with the reception officials Hayashi Daigaku-no-kami and Ido Tsushima-no-kami and signed the treaty

additional provisions. This treaty and its additional provisions were ratified and exchanged the following year, namely on January 5th of Ansei 2, also at Shimoda, between American envoy Adams and our country's reception officials.

**Arrival of British Ships**
However, not long after Perry left our country, on the 15th day of the intercalary 7th month of that year, a British fleet arrived at Nagasaki. The naval admiral was a man named James Stirling, who sent a letter to the magistrate stating: "Britain is currently allied with France in war against Russia to prevent Russia from swallowing up Europe. However, Russia has also extended its reach eastward and has already invaded Sakhalin and the Kurils, so it's not impossible that they might reach Japan's mainland as well. Therefore, British ships have come with the purpose of protecting our nation's vessels and repelling Russian ships in the East. In the future, not only our own ships but also those of our ally France will frequently visit these eastern waters, so we would like you to open suitable ports where our fleets may call."

The shogunate deliberated on this matter extensively, and ultimately decided to respond that "while we would accommodate requests for firewood, water, food, or ship repairs, we cannot under any circumstances assist any nation for military purposes." Stirling accepted this, saying that if the matter was completely unrelated to warfare, he would simply like permission to enter the two ports of Nagasaki and Hakodate. Eventually a seven-article agreement was concluded and signed. This formal treaty was exchanged on August 29th of the following year, Ansei 2, at Nagasaki between Stirling and the Nagasaki magistrates Arao Iwami-no-kami and Kawamura Tsushima-no-kami.

**The Russian Envoy's Return**
Given that America and Britain had concluded agreements with our country as described above, Russia, which had the prior relationship I mentioned earlier, could certainly not remain silent. That Putiatin, after leaving Nagasaki, appeared to have based himself in Shanghai and frequently reconnoitered our coastal waters, even though his home country was at war with Britain and France...

...while some records state there were eleven people, based on these names it appears there were even more. The Matsudaira Chronicles record that they were impaled at Ryuunenji-guchi outside Yoshida Castle. Ryuunenji refers to Ryuunenji Temple, and at that time Ryuunenji-guchi corresponded to one of the entrances to the castle compound. However, this massacre has become a major issue among historians, with some arguing that the downfall of the Imagawa clan was inevitable because of such acts. Even today, there is a place called Juusanhonzuka (Thirteen Burial Mounds) in the Fukuoka area of Takashi Village, Atsumi District, which is said by legend to have gotten its name from the burial of these hostages' bodies. However, I find this somewhat unreliable.

There is another story here, found in the Suganuma clan's Teikyo records, which is a tragic affair. Among the many hostages at this time was an eleven-year-old girl called "Omii," the younger sister of Suganuma Sadamitsu. She was also condemned to be impaled, but her wet nurse secretly learned of this and approached Yorita Sukeshiro, a descendant of hereditary retainers of the Suganuma family who was in the castle, and they escaped during the night. Thus this sister and her wet nurse were saved, but Yorita was later discovered and crucified outside Yoshida Castle when the matter came to light. There were indeed many cruel acts during this period.

Having had their hostages killed in this manner, these military leaders increasingly intensified their resistance against the Imagawa clan, and the situation in eastern Mikawa became ever more dangerous. At this time, in western Mikawa, in the fourth month, Ieyasu personally led troops to attack Kira Yoshiakira of Tojo. This Yoshiakira was the son of Saheoe-no-suke Yoshitaka and brother of Yoshisato. He is written with various names like Yoshitei, Yoshiaki, and Yoshiaki, but they all refer to this same Yoshiakira. Originally, as I mentioned in the previous chapter, the Kira clan was a branch of the Ashikaga clan. A person named Mitsushi, son of Chooshi, served as military governor of Mikawa and resided in Hazu District, becoming the first to take the name Kira. Yoshitaka was the eighth-generation descendant, but in Tenbun 5 he conspired with the Oda clan against the Matsudaira clan to restore his former territories, so he was killed by Imagawa Yoshimoto. His son Kozuke-no-suke Yoshiyasu lived in a place called Yabuta in Suruga on Yoshimoto's orders, while having his younger brother Yoshiakira defend Nishio Castle. However, this Yoshiakira also rebelled against Yoshimoto in Koji 2 and made overtures to Nobunaga, but before long...

...he again submitted to the Imagawa clan. At that time, Yoshiakira moved to Tojo Castle himself and invited Makino Shinjiro Sadanari from Ushikubo to defend Nishio Castle. This Sadanari was the ancestor of the Makino clan of Nagaoka Domain, as I have already mentioned in the previous chapter. However, many records incorrectly identify him as his son Narisada rather than Sadanari himself, which causes confusion. This mistake arose because both father and son initially used the name Shinjiro. Narisada simply doesn't fit the chronology, so it was definitely the father, Sadanari.

There are questions about the dates when Yoshiakira rebelled against the Imagawa clan and when Sadanari entered Nishio Castle, with several theories even in the investigations by the Makino Viscount family. According to the Mikawa Monogatari, after the Battle of Okehazama, both Yoshiakira and Sadanari belonged to the Oda clan, but when the Oda and Tokugawa clans made peace, they conversely joined the Imagawa side. However, since the Mikawa Monogatari was written merely from memory, I think it would be somewhat unreasonable to study it logically. Therefore, I believe the theory I mentioned earlier.

Now, since Ieyasu had finally allied with the Oda clan while Yoshiakira and others remained with the Imagawa side, he eventually came to attack them. The death of Matsudaira Yoshikage at Zenmyoji Embankment in Hazu District also occurred at this time, but due to the circumstances I mentioned earlier, many records confuse this event with those of Koji 2, and I believe records like those in the Matsudaira Chronicles suffer from the same problem.

At that time, there was a relative of Yoshiakira named Arakawa Kai-no-kami Yoshihiro, whose name is written in various ways such as Yorimochi, Yoshitou, and Yoshitora. Due to a rift with Yoshiakira, he made overtures to the Tokugawa side and joined forces to attack Nishio Castle. As a result, Makino Sadanari could no longer defend it and withdrew to Ushikubo. The fighting continued further, with battles such as the Battle of Fujinami Nawate on September 13th, but lacking sufficient strength, Yoshiakira finally surrendered to the Tokugawa clan. This temporarily brought peace to western Mikawa.

However, in eastern Mikawa, as I mentioned earlier, Kohara Shigezane was stationed at Yoshida Castle, serving as a so-called key retainer of the Imagawa clan. On July 29th of that year, he led troops from Ushikubo, Niregi, Ina and other places to attack Suganuma Sadamitsu at Noda. There...

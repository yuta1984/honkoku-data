departed from the port and resolutely entered Settsu Bay. At that time, Shogun Iemochi was at Osaka Castle, and the two senior councilors Abe and Matsumae were also in attendance, but Senior Councilor Abe immediately proceeded to Hyōgo to negotiate with the foreign ministers. However, given such circumstances, rumors were rampant in Kyoto that Senior Councilor Abe had acted arbitrarily to grant permission for the opening of Hyōgo port to the foreign ministers.

**Court Dismisses Both Senior Councilors Abe and Matsumae**

Therefore, the shock in Kyoto was considerable, and on October 1st, by imperial command, both Senior Councilors Abe and Matsumae were severely punished, relieved of their positions as senior councilors, stripped of their court ranks, and ordered to return to their domains for house arrest. Since the direct dismissal of shogunal senior councilors by the court was unprecedented, the shogun's anguish was beyond words, and on the same day he finally submitted his resignation to the court and immediately set out on his return journey east.

**Shogun Iemochi Submits His Resignation**

At this point, the court was also greatly alarmed and issued a gracious edict to the shogun, and on the 4th summoned senior retainers of the fifteen domains in Kyoto for deliberation. Of course, these deliberations could not easily reach agreement, but as a result of Hitotsubashi Yoshinobu and Senior Councilor Ogasawara fighting almost to the death, imperial permission for opening ports was finally granted for all except Hyōgo. However, originally the deadline for opening these two capitals and two ports had been postponed until December of Keiō 3, which was clearly stated in the treaties, yet this timing remained highly questionable and continues to require research by historians today. In any case, with such developments, shogunal authority gradually fell to the ground, and real power was gradually being restored to the court. The problem that arose around this same time was the second Chōshū expedition.

**The Second Chōshū Expedition**

As I mentioned previously, the Owari lord had once served as commander-in-chief against Chōshū and the matter was settled, but the shogunal council was primarily dissatisfied with the extremely lenient handling of the situation. Therefore, arguments were quite vigorous in the shogunal council that the Mōri father and son should be sent to Edo, that Lord Sanjō and others should also be sent to Edo, and that since they had already surrendered, it was natural they should receive appropriate punishment. Particularly in recent times...

the relationship between the shogunal council and Hitotsubashi had been one of bitter enmity like dogs and monkeys, yet strangely they were in agreement regarding Chōshū. Meanwhile, what was the situation in Chōshū? There was internal conflict between the war party and the submission party, but ultimately the war party was victorious, so increasingly something had to happen between the shogunate and Chōshū - this became the reason for the second Chōshū expedition. Therefore, the shogun entered Kyoto on May 23rd (Keiō 1) and after an imperial audience received an imperial rescript regarding the handling of Chōshū. He then deliberated in Osaka and on September 21st made a further memorial regarding its handling. However, at this time the court dismissed the senior councilors over the two capitals and two ports opening issue, so the shogun also submitted his resignation on October 1st as I mentioned previously, but there was immediately an imperial rescript ordering him not to resign. The shogunate then announced this to the various domains and sent an envoy to Hiroshima to interrogate Chōshū, thus arranging for the second Chōshū expedition. However, at this time, beginning with Satsuma domain, there were quite many who opposed this policy, all arguing that there was no reason for a second expedition. Yet the fact that this undertaking still came to pass shows that the shogunate, though weakened, still possessed considerable power. The imperial edict for the second Chōshū expedition was issued on June 7th, Keiō 2, but the results were truly unexpected - it ended in almost complete defeat of the Chōshū expedition forces. Moreover, during this campaign, Shogun Iemochi fell ill and his condition worsened daily until he finally passed away. The shogunal council's shock was immense, so they first ordered Hitotsubashi Yoshinobu to succeed the Tokugawa house, then announced the shogun's death. Subsequently, on December 5th (Keiō 2), imperial messengers came to Nijō Castle to inform Yoshinobu of his appointment as shogun.

became a French territory, and as you know, France and Britain were enemies at that time, so British ships wanted to capture Dutch trading vessels in this East Asian region. With the purpose of seizing regular ships sailing from Batavia, the Dutch base in the East Indies, to Nagasaki, they finally invaded our Nagasaki harbor on August 15th of Bunka 5.

This was the very time when Nagasaki magistrate Matsudaira Zusho-no-kami Yasuhide committed suicide to take responsibility, as the story goes.

Because these circumstances were not well understood, the negative impact that British ships had on our country was considerable, and at that time our country formed the impression that the British, like the Russians, were invaders attacking our nation. Later, Britain finally occupied Java, which had previously been Dutch territory, and established its own governor-general's office in Batavia. With the aim of taking control of the Dutch trading post on Dejima, which operated from the Netherlands to our Nagasaki, they again sent ships to our Nagasaki in Bunka 10, but even at this time, such circumstances were not understood at all in our country.

However, looking back from today's perspective, what can truly be called mysterious is this: since the Netherlands had become a French vassal state as I mentioned earlier, there should have been no place in the world where the Dutch flag was flying, yet only the Dutch post on Dejima in our Nagasaki harbor continued to fly the Dutch flag unchanged, benefiting from our country's isolationist policy. This was indeed a most interesting phenomenon. The fact that this Dutch trading post could not communicate with its homeland until after the House of Orange was restored to the Netherlands in later years was quite a strange circumstance, but since no one in our country knew of these affairs at the time, I think the story is truly fascinating.

Thereafter, British ships frequently appeared off our coasts, but these were mostly whaling ships and nothing particularly significant occurred. However, among these vessels, some repeatedly landed and committed violent acts, so the policy of expelling foreign ships, which had been relaxed in Kansei 9, became one of the motivations for the decree issued in February of Bunsei 8 to again strictly expel foreign ships.

Thus, after more than ten years had passed, by Tenpō 10 the European civil wars I mentioned earlier had nearly settled, but at that time Britain and of course rising European powers like France gradually began to concentrate their strength on this East Asian region. As a result of this influence, the well-known Opium War first broke out in China. Moreover, the outcome of the war was that by our Tenpō 13, China opened five ports including Canton to these European nations and ceded the island of Hong Kong to Britain, marking a new epoch in our East Asian history.

At this point, not only did Britain's plans for East Asia advance further, but other rising powers were encouraged to seek new territories and develop sources of profit, and the pressure for our country to open its doors became increasingly intense from this time forward.

The shogunate at that time was also compelled by this global trend and again relaxed the prohibition on expelling foreign ships in Tenpō 13, but in Kōka 2 the British warship Samarang came to Nagasaki, and in Kaei 2 its survey ship Mariner reached Uraga and Shimoda, causing considerable concern among shogunate officials, as you are already aware.

Now regarding America's actions toward our country: originally, the relationship between America and our country was not very old, and it began in Kansei 10 when Americans living in Dutch Batavia came to Nagasaki claiming to be Dutch and engaged in trade. There were occasional visits thereafter, but the arrival of the Morrison ship at Uraga in June of Tenpō 8 was particularly noteworthy.

I believe I mentioned this matter briefly before, but it truly had a significant impact on our country. Initially, an American trading company obtained some of our country's castaways and sought to return them, hoping thereby to gain an opportunity for trade. So they outfitted a ship named Morrison and sent it toward our country, and it arrived at Uraga in June of Tenpō 8. Since the purpose of their visit was originally trade, they wanted to demonstrate peace, so they came after removing all armaments. At that time in our country, as I mentioned before, the order to expel foreign ships...

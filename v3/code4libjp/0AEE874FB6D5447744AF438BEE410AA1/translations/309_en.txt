Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Imperial Restoration and Yoshida Domain) 590

**Main Text:**
There appears to be absolutely no intention to exhaust such sincerity toward the bakufu, so it seems they are waiting for the right moment to coordinate among themselves.

The recent disturbances in the Kansai region were reportedly caused mostly by warriors and common people of the outside domains. If so, these are unexpectedly extreme proposals, such as

escorting the Emperor to Hakone or having imperial edicts issued directly to the Kinai provinces - these are certainly not proper proposals or genuine actions. This is the collective sentiment of the outside domains, something we have long understood. Now, with great trepidation, the essential point of this occasion's

bakufu policies is specifically how the advantages and disadvantages of past foreign relations have affected the sentiments of the entire nation.

The fundamental principle since Tokugawa Ieyasu of unifying the realm and ensuring effective governance, and the recent global situation of worldwide opening, communication, and military conflicts (It appears that from the current era through the third generation, trade with Britain, France, and other countries was permitted, but afterward the isolationist policies became strict. However, keeping the Dutch alone was entirely for the purpose of investigating and understanding global changes and international situations, as evidenced by the frequent submission of intelligence reports. Therefore, there was deep consideration that in times of crisis, knowing beforehand what was not to be feared about them and establishing good strategies we could rely on, neither despising them nor neglecting ourselves) - all these matters should be carefully considered and reflected upon, along with the root causes that led even the Three Branch Houses, other related houses, and retainers

down to the lowest ranks to inevitably commit improper and unlawful acts, as well as the origins of why so many retainers of the great outside domain lords caused

disturbances this time. With complete equanimity, without any trace of stubborn self-interest, comparing all circumstances, deliberating and considering carefully, and then making

sincere apologies to the Imperial Court, reforming future policies with contrition and determination, and reaching firm, unwavering decisions - these are matters of the utmost

importance. Now, the great differences between inside and outside domains that I mentioned earlier

can certainly be explained and categorized by the bakufu, but

when viewed equally from the Imperial Court's perspective, it is simply that inside domains are modest and sincere in their actions, while outside domains are grand and rough in theirs -

this alone should not be considered a significant difference. Both equally exhaust loyal devotion for the nation's sake - this should be the natural

scope of the supreme imperial authority. However, since all these various root causes and origins arise entirely from foreign affairs, and domestic political

affairs have continued smoothly and effectively, it is precisely because His Majesty considers this so that in ancient times

such vigorous action as that of Emperors Go-Toba and Go-Daigo is absolutely

not in His Imperial Majesty's thoughts (The relationship between Court and bakufu hangs by a thread worth a thousand gold pieces, half-severed yet half-continuing. That the realm has not collapsed into complete ruin is entirely due to His Imperial wisdom and impartiality, through which He distinguishes all matters and deeply cherishes the Tokugawa house)

Moreover, the great achievements since Tokugawa Ieyasu and three hundred years of loyal service in maintaining peace are naturally considered

as firm as rivers, mountains, and solemn oaths. Should circumstances ever resemble those of the Jōkyū or Kenmu eras, not only would the foreign barbarians clap their hands in glee, but domestic strife and the people's suffering would be immediate realities. It is because His Imperial Majesty worries about such critically dangerous times

that He recently proclaimed: "Cultivate civil virtue internally, prepare military defenses externally, and resolutely achieve the feat of expelling foreigners. In this, consider various opinions and maintain the middle path." (Generally speaking, when discussing the "middle" in terms of length, if one side is long and the other short, that is not the middle. However, when considering weight, if the left is light and the right heavy, this still represents one long and one short achieving balance to create the middle. Therefore, hitting the target requires proper focus and impartial consideration to reach the correct conclusion.) "Honor the achievements of the Tokugawa founding ancestors and strengthen the realm's

discipline" (Since Tokugawa Ieyasu, the realm's discipline and control have been thorough, but over three hundred years, naturally those bonds have rotted, loosened, and weak points have developed. Like the I Ching's teaching about revolutionary change, responding to changing circumstances, even established discipline must eventually renew its bonds and replace weak points - such restoration of discipline follows natural principles)

"Therefore, formulate three strategies." His proclamation truly shows His genuine concern for the realm. The matter of expelling foreigners absolutely requires

achieving the unified righteous spirit of the Imperial nation, without which

His Imperial intentions cannot be fully realized. He deeply considers the bakufu's situation, and even if

the bakufu still lacks awareness and deep engagement, so that

His Imperial thoughts and intentions are not fully communicated, there are also matters of natural talent and human accommodation, so naturally

leaving such things to Heaven's mandate, He insists that this time one of the three strategies

should be selected according to the bakufu's convenience and implemented. This would gradually lead to natural reforms and

His intended plans would progressively be realized. Therefore, the merits and demerits of these three strategies

are naturally beyond the scope of narrow perspectives and ordinary wisdom to evaluate or even consider. Of course, since opinions are weighed and the middle path

is maintained, ultimately the purpose of this inquiry concerns these merits and demerits, but this humble retainer

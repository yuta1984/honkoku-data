Regarding this matter, there was much opposition from Mito Nariaki and others, so when America came to negotiate on this issue, they were determined to reject these conditions at all costs. However, this also followed the same pattern as before - when Harris arrived and gradually brought up negotiations, it became clear that refusal was impossible given the global situation.

*Subheading: Harris's Demands*
Consequently, Harris was eventually stationed at a temple called Gyokusen-ji in Kakizaki Village, Izu Province. Prior to this, in December of Ansei 2, a treaty had been concluded between the Dutch Consul-General residing at Dejima in Nagasaki and the Nagasaki magistrate of the time. This treaty contained provisions regarding Dutch merchant residences, which Harris now seized upon, arguing that based on the so-called most-favored-nation clause, his country should also enjoy equal rights. The shogunate responded by explaining the long-standing relationship between the Netherlands and our country, but Harris ultimately refused to accept this. From early Ansei 4 until May, the shogunate negotiated with him on this matter, but eventually found itself in an unavoidable position and consented to allow American merchants to reside in both Shimoda and Hakodate ports, and to station a vice-consul in Hakodate. On May 26th, they signed what was called a "regulation document."

Moreover, in the year of his arrival (Ansei 3), on September 27th, Harris submitted a letter to the Shimoda magistrate, requesting to personally come to Edo and meet with the highest officials to discuss matters. The coastal defense officials, senior inspectors, and inspectors reasoned that this could not possibly be prevented - if he were to wait for warships from his own country and then force entry into Edo Bay with threatening language, and if they then had to reluctantly grant his requests, this would damage our nation's prestige. Rather, they argued, following the Dutch precedent, they should allow him to meet with senior councillors and permit an audience at the castle. I believe this was indeed a wise view for that time, but since general public opinion considered granting such requests to be a national humiliation, the majority of shogunal officials were reluctant, and the argument concluded that the timing for allowing such an audience was still premature.

However, Harris's objections to this were extremely forceful, and after repeated negotiations with shogunal officials, this issue became a major diplomatic crisis. Finally, in the following year, on July 21st of Ansei 4, the shogunate capitulated and agreed to allow Harris to come to Edo for an audience at the castle.

*Subheading: Harris's Castle Audience*
Harris departed Shimoda on October 7th and traveled overland to Edo, completing his castle audience on the 21st and presenting a letter from the President through Senior Councillor Hotta Bitchu-no-kami. This was the first audience by a Westerner other than the Dutch, marking the establishment of proper diplomatic protocol for foreign relations.

*Subheading: Opposition from the Feudal Lords*
However, given the national sentiment I have described, Harris's journey to Edo and castle audience provoked intense opposition. The shogunate apparently recognized from the beginning that this could not be passed over in silence. After deciding to allow Harris's castle audience, they first communicated their intentions to the Three Houses and the tamarizume daimyo, then on August 14th issued a proclamation to all daimyo explaining the reasons for their decision. However, even the tamarizume daimyo including Hikone, Takamatsu, and Aizu - who actually leaned toward opening the country - opposed this as a great humiliation to the shogun's dignity and criticized the lack of prior consultation. The original anti-foreign faction naturally engaged in even more vehement debate.

However, since Harris had already been granted permission, nothing could be done about it. The conclusion was that this situation should be used to further demonstrate our nation's military preparedness to them - maintaining friendly relations on the surface while fully preparing for combat internally, thus projecting strength and forcing them to abandon their unreasonable demands. These arguments were advocated by Matsudaira Yoshinaga and others. While Yoshinaga had been a fervent anti-foreign advocate from the beginning, the fact that he no longer made the extreme arguments of the Kaei period but adopted relatively moderate positions was likely due to the enlightening influence of his advisor Hashimoto Sanai. In any case, the development of such views...

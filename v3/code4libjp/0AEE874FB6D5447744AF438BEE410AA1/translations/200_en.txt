Various materials that could serve as sources are also preserved in the warehouse of Aza Funamachi. To list them all would be extremely complex and difficult, but among them, what I find particularly interesting are the old ledgers in Funamachi concerning ferry crossings on the Toyokawa River.

At that time, as previously mentioned, when replacing or repairing the great bridge, the practice of constructing a new bridge alongside the old one or building a temporary bridge—as was done until the Genroku era—was no longer carried out. Instead, ferry boats were used for passage during construction. Of course, the same applied when floods damaged the bridge. The location used for these ferry crossings still bears the name "ferry crossing" today. All ferry operations were entrusted to the people of Ōaza Funamachi. The domain would lend them 25 or 30 ryō each time as operating expenses, which they would repay in annual installments—facts that can be seen in their account books. When there was traffic by daimyo and other officials, and insufficient boats were reported, vessels were requisitioned by quota from villages along the Toyokawa—not only within the Ōkōchi domain but even from outside territories, specifying how many boats from which locations.

In the fourth month of Kansei 4 (1792), bridge repairs necessitated starting ferry operations. A copy of the notice board posted at that time remains, and I believe publishing it will serve as valuable material for understanding conditions of that era. The complete text is shown below:

Kansei 5, fourth month - Magistrate

**Territorial Changes:** Here I would like to discuss the territorial changes that occurred within Nobuaki's domain during his tenure as lord. First, on the 29th day of the 6th month of Meiwa 9 (1772), he surrendered Shimo-Goi, Shimo-Sawaki, Onma, and Tametō from Hoi District, receiving in exchange on the 5th day of the 10th month of the same year: Asafu Village from Haibara District in Tōtōmi Province, and Kamo Village, Honjō Village, Wada Village, and Kamihirakawa Village from Kaitō District, totaling 2,918 koku and some. Next, on the 27th day of the 8th month of An'ei 3 (1774), he surrendered Hishikino, Maeshiba, Umeyabu, Ōtsuka, parts of Ina, and parts of the new rice fields there from Hoi District, receiving replacement lands from Atsumi District, Hoi District, and Nukata District. Furthermore, on the 6th day of the 11th month of An'ei 6 (1777), he returned the aforementioned Asafu Village in Haibara District and received replacement land from Kaitō District. A copy of the vermillion seal document newly granted to Yoshida domain on the 5th day of the 3rd month of Tenmei 8 (1788) exists, which I would also like to include below for reference:

Mikawa Province: 31 villages from Atsumi District, 39 villages from Yana District, 40 villages from Hoi District, 7 villages from Nukata District, from Kamo District...

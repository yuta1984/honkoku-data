Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (National Learning Scholars in Yoshida and Hatano Takao) 490

**Main Text:**
This was sent to [Atsutane], and Atsutane wrote his answers in his own hand and then sent it back from Atsutane to Takao as it was. Therefore, I would like you to view it with this understanding.

"Separate letter: I respectfully request your consideration. Though it is extremely rude of me recently, I have one or two matters I would like to request of the master. Please kindly intercede for me.

Item 1: In the late master's 'Tamahoko Hyakushu' (One Hundred Poems of the Sacred Spear):
'Children, do not be overly clever, but help the divine works of the gods called tama'
How should one understand 'helping the divine works of the gods'?
What kind of works should one do?
'It goes without saying that one should explain the Way of the Gods well, but one should say that it means to carefully carry on so as not to lose any of the things the gods began and established. The Chinese saying about 'participating in heaven and earth's nurturing transformation' also has this meaning.
That is to say, it means to help.'

Item 2: From the same 'Suzuya-shū' (Suzuya Collection):
'If these five characters were spiritually blessed, it would be especially good to say "Amaterasu," but it would not refer to the Great Goddess, but to the Muhi no Kami'
'The true white jewel bestowed by the god who illuminates heaven—if people do not see its light, they will not know'
'This should be said'
What is this light? What kind of works should one do to see this light?
'Light refers to the great Yamato heart. The works to see it are as stated in the previous poem.'

With humble fear, regarding the government regulations...

This Toyohashi City Historical Discourse is published once weekly (Tuesday) and presented to readers of Sanyō Newspaper

**Main Text:**
...regarding the various shrines, it is proper that shrine priests should exclusively study the Way of the Gods. What does 'Way of the Gods' mean?
'This probably refers to what is commonly called serving the gods and such. But taken more seriously, it could be said to be something expressed as broadly as possible.
Indeed so. To this humble talent...'
These matters are naturally what those who are shrine priests, and indeed anyone born as a human being, should first understand, but due to my poor abilities I cannot fully comprehend them, so I respectfully make this request. Though it is extremely rude to trouble you in your busy time, please consider this as the sincerity of my dedication to the Way, and kindly provide detailed instruction so I may understand. Of course, through correspondence...
'Good humble talent. So-called talented people amount to nothing. They end up with just poetry and prose. This is not disrespectful.
Do not think such matters presumptuous or tiresome—ask about such things as many times as you like.'
Though I request such things, I cannot say whether it is presumptuous or not, but as I stated in the main text, I really cannot visit you recently, so I make this request out of frustration.
Please sympathetically intercede with the master on my behalf. I humbly entreat this of you.

Atsutane
Most respectfully
To Hatano Takao-kun
To Hirata Atsuzane-kun"

This correspondence dates from when Takao was around 27 or 28 years old, and as I mentioned before, this was before he had entered Atsutane's school. Letters he exchanged with Ban Nobutomo from that time also remain and are quite valuable for reference. I plan to collect these among historical materials, so I would like to request your careful examination of them. Now, after Takao entered Atsutane's school, he devoted himself exclusively to that...

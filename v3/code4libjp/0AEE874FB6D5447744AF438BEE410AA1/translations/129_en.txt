Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (The Ogasawara Family Generations and Yoshida's Circumstances) 230

The clothing was originally cotton yukata, but upon entering the Genroku era it was changed to silk sarasa-dyed fabric, and by the 17th year silk damask was created. Moreover, in the aforementioned records it is detailed that at that time, to enliven this bamboo grass dance, remarkable masters emerged among the players of large and small drums. Reading this today, one can clearly sense how peaceful the times were and how the general trend had turned toward pleasure-seeking.

However, this era simultaneously reached the height of cultural prosperity. Particularly, since Shogun Tsunayoshi was fond of learning, he attempted various projects. As I have mentioned before, he ordered genealogical investigations not only of all daimyo but also of their retainers down to rural samurai. What the daimyo and hatamoto submitted at that time is called the Jōkyō Survey, which remains an extremely valuable historical source today.

Since this was the situation, this trend also spread to various provinces at the time. When Nagasuke ordered the town magistrate Nishiwaki Seijirō to conduct a municipal survey of Yoshida in Jōkyō 5, which was Genroku 1 (1688), this too can be seen as partly influenced by that trend. A copy of the investigation report from that time fortunately still remains.

At this time, maps of each district of Yoshida city were also prepared. This is recorded in the survey report, and there is a most interesting story about this: some years ago, Mr. Ōtsuji Tahei of Kanenote district saw over ten old maps of Yoshida among antiques at a used goods dealer and purchased them. However, at the time they did not seem to be considered particularly old or valuable. When I heard this story from city councilor Mr. Wakasugi Fusajirō, I immediately sent someone to Mr. Ōtsuji to borrow the maps, and upon gradual investigation, we discovered these were indeed from that very year Genroku 1.

There are naturally various grounds for this conclusion, but Funamachi district has long preserved a copy of an old map of just that district, with annotations by village headman Tōjū. According to this, the original map was owned by wholesaler Shichirōemon of Honmachi district, borrowed and copied by Funamachi in the 8th month of Kansei 12 (1800). The appraisal at that time recorded it as at least pre-Genroku.

When comparing this map with the Funamachi section of Mr. Ōtsuji's maps, though there are minor differences in detail, they match perfectly. Of course, when village headman Tōjū copied this, the municipal survey of Genroku 1 was unknown, and consequently Nishiwaki Seijirō's survey report could not be consulted, so it was vaguely appraised as at least pre-Genroku.

However, comparing Nishiwaki's survey report with these maps today, I believe my assertions are unshakeable. Whether Mr. Ōtsuji's maps are originals from that time or later copies is somewhat difficult to state definitively, but in any case, if this is correct, they should be considered the oldest surviving district maps of this area.

So much for this story, but according to the survey report and maps, Yoshida at that time had a total of 24 districts with only 1,000 households. The length and width of each district, positions of gates like Sōmon and Ōtemon, and the condition of Toyokawa Bridge are all clearly shown. However, it would be extremely difficult to list all these details here, so it would be most convenient if you could examine the actual documents.

Also in Genroku 2 (1689) there was a reconstruction of the great bridge. This construction work was quite elaborate, and fortunately Funamachi district preserves the design documents from that time, titled "Genroku 2nd Year, 5th Month, Mikawa Province Yoshida Great Bridge New Construction Bidding Record." From this the design is clearly understood: first a new bridge was built alongside the old one, and when completed, the old bridge was demolished. The structure naturally had railings with giboshi (decorative finials), identical to Seta's long bridge seen today.

Interesting here is the travel diary "Homecoming Diary" by the famous Inoue Tsūjo. As you know, this person was a renowned wise woman who served the Kyōgoku family. This diary records her journey from Edo to her home province of Sanuki's Marugame in the 6th month of Genroku 2, and in the entry for the 17th day of the 6th month...

Memorial

(Seiken's Memorial) Recently, instructions were issued that each person should express their opinions frankly regarding the reforms at the facility. Although we are ignorant, since there appears to be special profound consideration involved, remaining silent would be against our true intentions. Therefore, without regard for our many faults, we humbly present our small loyalty.

Regarding the establishment of the navy, there is no clear educational policy other than theoretical study combined with practical experience. What we call theoretical study is the learning of thorough mastery of principles. Before testing anything in practice, each person should thoroughly research the principles according to their assignment, accumulating knowledge over years until achieving complete understanding. Then, adding even more practical application, with teachers evaluating proficiency levels, and only after achieving thorough mastery should one begin actual practical application. This constitutes true practical experience.

Therefore, it is essential to focus attention on the boundary between theoretical study and practical experience, and to establish clearly the timing for transitioning from theory to practice. If this boundary and timing becomes confused, even after years of naval education, there will be no achievement. No matter how talented individuals may be, there is absolutely no logic in abandoning this thorough mastery of principles and relying only on immediate practical application.

Regarding this matter, young people of suitable character should be widely selected for use. Not only direct retainers but also indirect retainers, if they are truly motivated, should be employed. Since each person has aspirations, first investigate these aspirations, then assign appropriate subjects and order strict study. Even the most untalented young people will naturally develop the spirit of diligent effort. In foreign countries this is called "Cadet School," which refers to the education of young people. While this applies not only to naval affairs but to all skills, examining the current situation closely, among all schools, naval education is most urgent.

Regarding the education of young people, research into principles is primary, but this serves as the pathway to practical experience. We humbly request that you consider the above points. Moreover, the Naval Bureau has required enormous expenses up to now. Though it is presumptuous, I have considered this deeply - no matter how enormous the expenses, if they eventually serve the nation in times of crisis, this would truly be an unprecedented achievement for our country.

Even if future expenses were reduced by one percent, if the great enterprise fails to flourish, it would still constitute enormous wasteful expenditure. Conversely, even if expenses increased a hundredfold from current levels, as long as this great enterprise of national restoration is fully realized, it could not be called enormous wasteful expenditure. Regarding this matter, we are fortunate that English, French, American, and Dutch are currently stationed in Yokohama. If excellent teachers were selected for youth education and summoned to the facility, later generations would naturally become proficient in the principles of various subjects. Furthermore, concerning accounting, foreign countries'

naval "Administration" concerns accounting, so if detailed inquiries were made about what systems are established, everything would become as clear as showing one's palm. However, under current circumstances, it would be difficult to immediately summon foreigners to the facility for instruction. Therefore, would it not be appropriate to establish such a "Cadet School" in Yokohama rather than limiting it to Edo?

Even if this presents difficulties under current circumstances, how about immediately ordering these two books, "Cadet School" and "Administration," from foreign countries, and after their arrival, ordering their translation? We respectfully seek your policy guidance.

As stated in the preceding text, any unproductive expenses should be reduced even by the smallest amount, but regarding anything that leads to success, no matter how enormous the expenses, since this would complete an unprecedented great enterprise for our country, it would be appropriate not to economize.

Furthermore, accounting officials should work day and night on naval education without regard to expense, naval officials should focus on the great enterprise of the nation, and if they also consider unproductive expenses, officials working together constitute the beginning of the nation's great enterprise. Though our humble canine loyalty may be presumptuous, we humbly request your enlightened consideration. With repeated bows and respectful submission.

(Seiken's Encounter with Shidō) I believe this memorial dates to Genji 1 (1864). The following year, in the spring of Keiō 1 (1865), Seiken was taking a stroll to view the cherry blossoms at Ueno one day. Suddenly, he encountered his childhood friend Sekine Rokusaburō.

Originally, this Sekine was a retainer of Yoshida Domain, as I mentioned previously. His father was called Sekine Gunzō Yoshinari, and he was born in Tenpō 11 (1840) at the domain residence in Yanaka, Edo. His eldest brother Magoichi, whose given name was Yoshinao, took the literary name Kōson and was skilled in poetry and calligraphy. His second brother Toyojirō left early to be adopted into the Nagashio family. However, when the eldest brother Yoshinao died young, Rokusaburō

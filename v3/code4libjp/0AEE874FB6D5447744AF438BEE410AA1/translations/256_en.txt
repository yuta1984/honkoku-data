on the 10th, he finally became one who would never return. For these reasons, I ultimately could not hear his life story directly from Kozan-sensei, which I deeply regret. Even since then, I have not yet had the opportunity to make detailed inquiries about his son and others, but I plan to thoroughly investigate the master's life history when the opportunity arises and add detailed information later as a supplement.

So the story returns to the earlier point: ultimately, as a result of the judgment, Kozan was to be imprisoned in his domain and was escorted to Yoshida. This was around October or November of Ansei 6 (1859), when Kozan was 44 years old. According to surviving elderly residents about the circumstances at that time, Yoshida domain established a place of confinement in Kawage-chō. Its structure was that of an ordinary house with about two tatami rooms, around which a sturdy wooden fence was built, creating what was called a "sitting room prison." Initially it was extremely strict, not permitting casual meetings with people. However, gradually these restrictions loosened, so young domain retainers began visiting his confinement quarters to engage in debates. Among the young retainers of Yoshida domain at that time, Hozumi Seiken was exactly 24 years old during Kozan's confinement in Ansei 6, still in Edo devoting himself to studying Dutch learning at the academy of an Awa domain retainer named Takahata Gorō. Kojima Kansō was 32 years old, at a time when his opinions on domain administration were somewhat being implemented, but these men were all in Edo. Among those who were in Yoshida, people like Sekiguchi Ryō, Sekine Rokusaburō, and the still-living Nakamura Michita and Miura Hekisui were beginning to distinguish themselves. These young men frequently entered Kozan's confinement quarters to discuss current affairs. According to direct accounts from Miura Hekisui and others today, during Kozan's confinement he was quite spirited, and his arguments were based on the same methodology as works like the Dai Nihon-shi and Rai San'yō's Nihon Gaishi, with the consistent argument that it was regrettable from a historical perspective for political power to rest in military hands. Regarding the opinions of Yoshida domain's young men on this matter, while there were probably some differences depending on the individual, fundamentally the inertia of having governed the realm through military power for so long had not departed from their thinking either.

The prevailing thought was that being loyal to the shogunate was ultimately the proper method of serving the emperor, and having all major government come from the shogunate's hands was the essential principle of imperial rule. Particularly since Yoshida domain had been hereditary retainers of the Tokugawa from ancient times, and the current leader Elder Manabe was also the father of domain lord Nobuhisa, they recognized that the shogunate's foreign policy was unavoidable. Consequently, they seemed to regard Mito Nariaki's obstinate arguments as rather detrimental to the nation. In a letter that Matsudaira Yoshinaga's strategist Nakane Yukie sent on February 18, Ansei 5 to Takatsukasa house administrator Mikuni Daigaku, it states:

"Now the court is urgently seeking to seize the shogun's authority. There is no time to display military might to foreign barbarians. I secretly hear that upon hearing of the barbarian ministers' visit to the capital, they lament the Japanese shogun's lack of authority. If the barbarians already know his authority is light, with what shall we subdue barbarian sentiments in the future? Though imperial authority should naturally subdue the shogun, without borrowing the shogun's hand, subduing the barbarians cannot be achieved. Unless the shogun's ministers have authority second only to the shogun, they cannot make the three hundred daimyo submit. Current court discussions seek to empty the military government's authority, demanding that [the shogun] come to the capital to plan military government in the forbidden precincts. If ministers are abandoned and the words of daimyo are trusted, the military government will lose its authority and the barbarians will become rampant; with ministers powerless, the daimyo will become presumptuous. For this reason, it is inevitable that great upheaval will arise within the imperial land. However, current plans are not what we advocate. Right now, due to the court discussions' delays, the situation in Kantō has people's hearts in turmoil. Those planning domestic governance deeply worry about this. Please understand this well."

This seems to truly reflect the sentiments of the majority at that time. Moreover, since this was written by someone from the so-called Hitotsubashi faction as I mentioned earlier, I think it deserves even more attention. Actually, even when listening to what elderly people say today and considering what the general intentions of Yoshida domain were at that time, I deduce that this was likely their way of thinking. However, at this point

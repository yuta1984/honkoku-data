*Subheading: The Imperial Court Censures the Shogunate*

They explained that in accordance with changing conditions, ancient institutions should be reformed to carry out the opening of the country, and reckless warfare should be opposed. However, this became quite a major issue for the imperial court, causing heated debate among court nobles. Most of this was naturally anti-foreign sentiment, which, while resulting from lack of understanding of overseas conditions, had various underlying causes.

Ultimately, the imperial court, in January of the following year (Ansei 5), dispatched court nobles to the residence of the Kyoto deputy with imperial instructions. The gist was: "While it is true that national administration has been entrusted to the shogunate, changing the strict system that has existed since the Kanei era is a matter of great importance. The shogunate should have thoroughly discussed this matter, reported to the imperial court, and if unavoidable, should have requested imperial edicts to announce this to the nation. It is improper that this process has been bypassed. In previous years, when temple bells were to be recast, an imperial edict was requested and granted. Why has there been no such petition regarding this weighty matter?" This clearly meant censuring the shogunate.

Originally, this temple bell recasting affair in Ansei 2 involved melting down temple bells to cast cannons for national defense - a proposal by Mito Nariaki, as you know. Presumably, Senior Councilor Abe Ise-no-kami had petitioned for an imperial edict based on this proposal, though Ii Naosuke at the time opposed it, saying he "could not bear the concern over signs of declining military prestige."

Now the imperial court unexpectedly used this precedent to censure the shogunate's arbitrary conduct of foreign affairs. In any case, the shogunate envoys' journey to Kyoto had merely provoked imperial opposition.

Meanwhile in Edo, negotiations with Harris had progressed significantly, and as mentioned earlier, the thirteenth meeting on January 12th had substantially concluded matters. Given the national situation described above, they felt it absolutely necessary to obtain imperial permission before signing, so they were awaiting the results of Hayashi Daigaku-no-kami's mission to Kyoto.

Given these circumstances, it became clear that obtaining favorable imperial instructions for their return to Edo was unlikely.

*Subheading: Senior Councilor Hotta's Journey to Kyoto*
Therefore, the shogunate had no choice but to send Senior Councilor Hotta to Kyoto, accompanied by Kawaji and Iwase, to mediate among the court nobles.

*Subheading: The Complication of the Shogunal Succession Issue*
Here arose yet another troublesome major problem - the matter of shogunal succession. The thirteenth Tokugawa shogun, Iesada, was constitutionally weak and certainly not capable of controlling the feudal lords and managing government affairs during these turbulent times. Even the previous shogun Ieyoshi had worried about this, but just as the great crisis of Perry's arrival in Kaei 6 occurred, Ieyoshi died.

At this time, Ieyoshi apparently felt that his heir Iesada could not handle this unprecedented national crisis, as he left instructions to rely on Mito Nariaki. Matsudaira Yoshinaga also earnestly urged the then-Senior Councilor Abe Ise-no-kami to consult with Nariaki on government matters. For several years thereafter, Shogun Iesada simply remained passive, waiting for the senior councilors' decisions. As you know, the situation became increasingly difficult, causing frequent changes in senior councilor positions, and political undercurrents grew more turbulent.

Among the feudal lords and retainers, there was a strong feeling that to rescue the situation, establish national policy, unify national opinion, and suppress foreign interference, they must rely on exceptional talent. Initially, many placed their hopes in Nariaki.

However, Nariaki's proposals tended toward dangerous extremism and showed ignorance of overseas conditions, making them often impractical. This gradually created incompatibility with shogunate authorities, and even the capable Abe Ise-no-kami seemed overwhelmed. Yet Nariaki's reputation remained high in some quarters, and these people rather blamed the shogunate. But as circumstances became clearer, this too changed from earlier attitudes.

Particularly since Shogun Iesada would likely never have children, the succession issue arose.

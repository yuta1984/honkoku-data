Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Yoshida Domain During Its Residence in Osaka and Yamamoto Hayao) 562

**Main Text:**
　　　　　　　Mr. [Nakayama] also only speaks of it occasionally, which I have heard. How is Master Genji faring? I heard he was ill, so I sent a brief letter the other day, but please by all means ensure that your imperial loyalist aspirations do not waver. This year will surely see great upheaval, and I believe the period of restoration is not far off. There has been no move for the Shogun to proceed to the capital. Chōshū's reputation has improved somewhat, while Shimazu Saburō is becoming somewhat opportunistic and his reputation is gradually worsening. Inshū [Tottori domain] has a good reputation. Lord Hitotsubashi is doing very well, while ○○ Palace is not performing well.
　　　　　　　There is also talk that ○○○○○○ should be dismissed. This is entirely due to ○○ Palace's scheming. It is said that Shimazu Saburō is of the same mind. I write this hastily for now. Written in haste. End.
　　　　　　　　　　18th day　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Hayao
　　　　　　　　　　　　Lord Shigenori

　　　　　　In the above letter, "○○ Lord" refers to a certain senior councilor of Yoshida domain who was stationed in Osaka at the time. This senior councilor was what one might call a conservative, so there was no way his views could align with those of imperial loyalists. Therefore, since this senior councilor was returning to the domain, Hayao was concerned that when he met with Hatano Takao upon his return, Takao in his honest and straightforward way might carelessly mention that Hayao had imperial loyalist aspirations, which would be extremely dangerous. So he sent this request asking that Takao be warned to keep quiet beforehand. This gives us a vivid picture of the circumstances of the time.

　　　　　　Now, in the seventh month of that year, as already mentioned in the previous chapter, Chōshū domain retainers once again entered Kyoto in succession from their home domain, and on the 18th came the famous Battle of Hamaguri Gate. At this time, our Yoshida domain in Osaka also dispatched troops and was diligent in guard duties, as mentioned in the previous chapter. According to the direct account of Elder Miura Hekisui, he was daily involved in these guard duties at the time and would chat and laugh with Hayao in the same location.

**Main Text:**
　　　　　　Hayao was constantly showing signs of passionate indignation, expressing the view that what Chōshū domain was doing ultimately aligned with imperial wishes, so treating them as enemies was truly inappropriate. However, the elder and others thought this was just talk, and that surely in reality there wouldn't be anything that serious. But who could have imagined that Hayao would actually abandon his domain a day or two before the Hamaguri Gate incident and join the so-called imperial loyalist activists? From then on, both his domain and of course the shogunal officials urgently searched for him, so he temporarily fled to Yamato, then further to the eastern provinces intending to join the Tsukuba uprising. However, when he reached Kōfu he heard of its collapse, so he returned and secretly hid in this Yoshida area for a while. According to one account, he stayed at Takao's house for several days during this time. Later he fled to the Chūgoku region, gathered like-minded people between Inaba and Hōki provinces, and finally joined with Chamberlain Washio. Even afterwards, he would occasionally travel incognito through this area to rally comrades, and each time he would secretly send letters to old acquaintances inquiring about his family's safety - such letters still remain today. From then until the Meiji Restoration, Hayao worked tirelessly and energetically, but since abandoning his domain he had changed his name to Yamamoto Ichirō. Since I plan to describe his later activities gradually as appropriate occasions arise, for convenience I would now like to present the grave inscription composed by Count Higashikuze and briefly introduce the main points of his career.

**Hayao's Domain Abandonment**

　　　　　　　　　　　Grave Inscription for Lord Yamamoto Hayao
　　　　　　　　　Imperial Guard Commander, Army General, Grand Cordon, Second Rank Prince Akihito inscribed the seal
　　　　　　　In early Keiō, I met you in the capital. At that time the shogunate was failing in governance, corrupt officials were exercising their authority, and they despised righteous men, viewing them as mortal enemies. You used your capable talents to form friendships with outstanding men and ultimately achieved your aspirations. You were truly a great man of our time. Your personal name was Hayao, your original surname Hozumi, initially of the Kamei clan, called Magoroku with the given name Shigeo. Later you changed your name to Yamamoto Ichirō. Your ancestors are said to descend from Kamei Rokurō Shigekiyo. Your father was named Shigemasa, called Rokugozaemon. Your mother was of the Katayama clan. You were their eldest son. For generations your family served Mikawa Yoshida domain through swordsmanship. You early inherited the family profession. In Genji 1 (1864) you followed your domain lord to Osaka Castle and passionately advocated for imperial reverence.

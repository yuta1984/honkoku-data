Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Imperial Restoration and Yoshida Domain) 578

**Main Text:**
What I have described above is an extremely brief account of the course of the Imperial Restoration. Now, what attitude did our Yoshida domain take during the period I have described? I think I must explain this somewhat below.

**Activities of Yoshida Domain**

As I have already detailed in the previous chapter, our Yoshida domain served as Osaka castle governor from June of Bunkyū 2 until February of Keiō 1. At that time, those mainly participating in domain administration were Chief Retainer Nishimura Jiuemon and Advisor Kojima Kansō.

Kojima Kansō was, as I mentioned before, a talented graduate of the Shōheikō academy who had stayed long in Mito and been close to Fujita Tōko, and had long cherished the great principle of imperial reverence. However, as you know, our domain lord's house was a hereditary retainer of the Tokugawa clan and was in a position where it had to dedicate body and family completely to that clan. Therefore, Kansō's anguish can truly be appreciated today when studying his surviving manuscripts. The document presented below is one piece that Kansō once submitted in response to inquiries from domain lord Nobuhisa. As you know, in Bunkyū 2, when Prince Ōhara came down to Kantō as imperial messenger and presented the so-called "Three Policies" to the shogunate, Nobuhisa secretly copied these Three Policies and had Kansō review them privately, seeking his opinion. This should be seen as the first part of what Kansō submitted at that time. Since I have already described the circumstances of that time in detail in the previous chapter, I think there is no need to repeat them here. In any case, the world was extremely tumultuous and it was a time when sonnō jōi (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians) arguments were vigorously emerging. For Kansō, though he was a retainer of Yoshida domain which served as hereditary vassals of the Tokugawa house, what he submitted to his domain lord can be evaluated as truly bold discourse. Therefore, I believe we can glimpse the opinions that Kansō held at that time from this document. However, there should be a second part containing his opinions on the Three Policies, but it is regrettable that this has now been lost and cannot be found. In any case, even just this first part is quite lengthy, but I think it is extremely

◦Response to Your Inquiry

Regarding the volume I was commanded to examine on the 21st of last month, though it is extremely presumptuous for me to express my humble thoughts, since there have been informal indications of your wishes and the situation truly cannot be avoided, and since forgiveness cannot be sought, I will present below my humble and lowly views point by point, regardless of consequences and without fearing what should be feared or avoiding what should be avoided.

However, though it goes without saying, my humble thoughts are based entirely on the universal principles of all ages and the public opinion of the realm. Since naturally I have no way to inquire into the actual detailed circumstances, these are like the献芹 [offering of wild vegetables] of a woodcutter—I present them without claiming they have any real substance. Therefore I humbly request your compassion in not taking them ill, and that you dismiss any inappropriate matters.

Though I fear to respond with this crude written document to an unexpected inquiry, and though the volume I was commanded to examine has no substance, it is

An imperial edict from
His Majesty
of vast consequence to the realm. For a lowly retainer like myself even to examine it is naturally most fearful and presumptuous, let alone to offer criticism—this would incur serious divine punishment. However, I privately consider that the current crisis of order and disorder in the realm

The relationship between court and military government is as precarious as the metaphor of pulling a thousand-kin weight by a single hair—if that connection breaks even for a moment, the realm will collapse like earth crumbling and tiles shattering. If that connection ultimately does not break, then not only will it be auspicious for

The Tokugawa house

but it concerns the eternal security of the imperial country, imperial house, and realm for ten thousand generations. Whether that connection described above breaks or does not break is, though I fear to say,

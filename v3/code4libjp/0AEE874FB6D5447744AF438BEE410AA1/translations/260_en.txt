Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (National Learning Scholars in Yoshida and Hatano Takao) 492

...devoted himself to these studies, and his close relationships with renowned national learning scholars throughout the country, including Ban Nobutomo and others, grew ever stronger. He was without question a diligent and deeply scholarly person, and among the books remaining in the Hada Library that he founded, there are some where he began making notations in 1815 (Bunka 12) and continued until 1872 (Meiji 5). For over forty years, he filled virtually every available space with the results of his textual research, leaving the pages completely covered in red and black fine script. Takao established the Hada Library in his garden in 1848 (Kaei 1), and its collection gradually grew to over 10,360 volumes, mostly consisting of national classics, with quite a few rare and unusual books. Among them were the "Ruijū Kokushi" (Classified National History) in 30 volumes donated by Senior Counselor Sanjō Sanemitsu, the "Imperial Commentary on the Classic of Filial Piety" in 1 volume, the "Haja-shū" (Collection Against Heresy) donated by former Middle Counselor Tokugawa Nariaki of Mito, and many other books presented by distinguished figures from various regions. The plaque displayed at the front of the library was written by Sanjō Sanemitsu, and later His Imperial Highness Prince Arisugawa also bestowed his calligraphy. The library's books recently faced the threat of dispersal due to certain circumstances, which greatly concerned those who cared about them, but fortunately the majority of them, along with Prince Arisugawa's plaque, have now come to be preserved in the Toyohashi City Library, which I believe is truly a cause for celebration. In any case, undertaking such a project in those times was no easy matter, but among Takao's friends who assisted this enterprise, there were quite a large number even from Yoshida alone. This can be understood from the book catalog in Takao's own hand that still exists today, which lists the names of donors for each individual book, greatly illuminating the circumstances of that time. Among them, Sano Hōu was particularly one of the most influential supporters of this enterprise and is certainly a person who must be remembered.

**Sano Hōu:** As you know, Sano Hōu was a townsman of Yoshida Honmachi and the owner of a manjū (steamed bun) shop called Yorozuya. These manjū were called "Yoshida manjū" and were once counted among the famous products of the Tōkaidō. Hōu was born on the 14th day of the 10th month of 1809 (Bunka 6). His childhood name was Einosuke, and he later took the names Gon'emon and Gonzaburō. His formal name was Shinnei and his literary name was Goseien Hōu. He later served as a wholesale dealer elder...

...and other positions. From his youth he enjoyed haikai poetry, and it is said that he composed the verse "In the sandy field / a turtle digs its burrow / in the spring haze" when he was fourteen years old. At that time, Seiseisho Takuchi saw this and considered it remarkable, taking him as a disciple. He also once studied under Nakayama Biseki. Later, however, he studied national learning under Hatano Takao, and indeed when the Hada Library was founded, he was among those who most generously contributed his private wealth to support it, and the books donated by him still number in the many hundreds today. Takao was, as I mentioned before, a sincere national learning scholar and a person of diligent practice and self-improvement...

**Takao and the Loyalist Patriots:** ...but in fact he was a hidden central figure in the loyalist movement. Consequently, Hōu was also an ardent loyalist who constantly supported Takao. Because of this situation, the so-called "patriots" who associated with Takao, Hōu and others were truly numerous, and those patriots who secretly traveled east and west during that time invariably visited Takao's house during their journeys, staying as guests for periods ranging from one or two days to several months. Among them, people like Fujimori Kyōsuke and Fukuba Bisei were particularly close, and I believe that among those who later rose to positions in the government, there were certainly not a few who had been guests in this house. Just ten days ago, I met Baron Kitabatake Harufusa at Hōryūji Temple in Yamato for the first time in over twenty years, and even then the conversation turned to the venerable Takao, including discussion of the library's preservation. According to his direct account, even Baron Kitabatake, who was among the Totsukawa rōshi of that year, frequently visited Takao's house before the Restoration, and they were truly intimate friends. Also, though the period is somewhat different, it is interesting to note that the current Army General Ōkubo Haruno also lodged at Takao's place during his youth to pursue his studies. However, Takao was, as I mentioned before, a true national learning scholar through and through, a person who was utterly faithful to his primary duty as a Shinto priest, and moreover possessed a cautious and careful temperament. Though he harbored loyalist aspirations in his heart and protected and assisted many patriots, he never went so far as to take up the sword and join the ranks of the patriots himself. This fortunately allowed him to avoid suspicion at the time and escape calamity...

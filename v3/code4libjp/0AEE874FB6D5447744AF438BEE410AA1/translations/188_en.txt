and subsequently became Senior Councilor, with unrivaled authority. Thus, the good governance and fine administration that had been painstakingly developed by Sadanobu, Nobuaki, and others since Sadanobu's time was destroyed in a single morning. This Ezo administration was also completely abolished in Bunsei 4 (1821), just five years after Nobuaki's death. The Matsumae Magistrate was abolished, and Matsumae Akihiro was again enfeoffed and given the Ezo territory.

At this point, the northern frontier gateway that Nobuaki had so painstakingly developed returned to its former laxity. Subsequently, Russians began migrating to Sakhalin in succession, eventually extending even to the Kuril Islands. Unfortunately, the Matsumae clan's power was completely inadequate to deal with this situation, and they allowed this encroachment to proceed unchecked, which I believe was truly regrettable beyond measure. This makes me reflect all the more on the magnitude of Nobuaki's achievements.

⦿Anecdotes of Matsudaira Nobuaki

There are indeed numerous stories about Nobuaki's deeds, and I intend to eventually compile them into a separate booklet. Therefore, here I will only outline the main points. Beyond what has been discussed above, I would like to share various anecdotes for convenience.

Originally, Nobuaki was a person of considerable strict character who would not accept anything unreasonable. He was truly a person of upright conduct without personal bias. The famous Kashi Yawa (Midnight Tales) also records such a story:

The Mizoguchi clan, lords of Shibata domain in Echigo Province, were closely related to Nobuaki. During Nobuaki's time as Senior Councilor, there was a matter of a young heir succession. The retainers thought that since their lord was too young, it would be inconvenient for official purposes, so they privately consulted Nobuaki about possibly adding two or three years to his age when reporting to the authorities. However, Nobuaki said that

this was absolutely outrageous and expedient behavior, firmly rejecting it outright. The Mizoguchi clan's retainers who heard this secretly regretted their request.

The same book also tells of a time when there was a Noh performance and during the banquet, senior retainers were resting in the duty room. One senior retainer asked Ogiwara Rin'ami, the head of the dōbōshū, what the next Noh play would be, inquiring about the program. This Rin'ami was of hasty temperament, so he responded to the question saying the next play would be "Shūchaku" (Attachment). However, this name "Shūchaku" was a vulgar name given by popular kabuki theaters, adapted from the Noh play "Shakkyō" (Stone Bridge), so there was originally no such name in Noh. He should have answered "Shakkyō," but in his hasty response said "Shūchaku," causing everyone to burst into laughter. Even Nobuaki, who was usually stern and composed, apparently could not contain himself and finally burst out laughing.

From this we can see that even the author of this book, Lord Matsura Seizan, evaluated Nobuaki as a stern and composed person, and this anecdote really allows us to imagine his usual demeanor.

**Nobuaki's Benevolence**
Thus Nobuaki was indeed a very serious person, but on the other hand, he was also truly compassionate, especially showing great benevolence toward those of lower station. Another story from Kashi Yawa tells that when Nobuaki was Senior Councilor, there was a man named Yugeta Shin'uemon among the guard units who was involved in some incident and was ultimately ordered to commit seppuku. The inspector who went to witness this finally completed his duty as night fell, but according to regulations, he had to report immediately, so he first went to a certain wakadoshiyori's residence.

However, the gate was already locked and he could not enter. Even after it was finally opened, there was a flurried appearance as they hurriedly brought out candles to the entrance. The inspector thought that in this state, if he went to the Senior Councilor's residence now, he would probably be kept waiting at the gate for quite a while, so he prepared himself accordingly. But when he went to Nobuaki's residence, contrary to his expectations, the gate was properly open, and moreover, the master Nobu-

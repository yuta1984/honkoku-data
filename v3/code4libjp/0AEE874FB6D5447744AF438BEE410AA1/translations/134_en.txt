In the records I possess, there is also written:

"At the time of the said earthquake, by order of the lord of the castle, 1,000 ryō was lent to all the townspeople, and 1,000 ryō to two honjin and thirty-seven inns, totaling 2,000 ryō to be repaid over ten years."

It appears that the citizens were deeply grateful for this benevolence, as the "Record of Yoshida in Mikawa Province" contains the following:

"On the 21st day of the 12th month of Hōei 5 [1708], to pray for the longevity of castle lord Makino, all the townspeople gathered at Seishū-ya and performed music and dance in what was called Ōhimachi. This was done out of gratitude because the lord, with compassion for the people's suffering from last year's earthquake, provided additional relief and assistance."

From this, it appears that the citizens performed Ōhimachi to express gratitude for Lord Makino's benevolent relief efforts and to pray for his continued military fortune.

**Shipbuilding Subsidies**
I will conclude the earthquake discussion here, but I would like to mention the matter of shipbuilding subsidies. As you know, the Tokugawa shogunate had grown quite weary of foreign relations around the time of the Shimabara Rebellion and adopted a strict isolationist policy. Based on this principle, they strictly regulated shipbuilding and prohibited the construction of large ships of 500 koku or more capacity. However, as Edo gradually developed and it became necessary to promote the import of products from various provinces, this became practically problematic given the limited transportation facilities of the time. Therefore, during Tsunayoshi's era, the restrictions on shipbuilding were finally relaxed, allowing the construction of merchant ships up to 1,000 koku capacity.

Consequently, daimyo often built large ships under the pretext of merchant vessels and planned to export products from their domains to Edo. Narihide also frequently lent money to townspeople who built ships, encouraging this activity. Therefore, many people in Funa-machi ōaza benefited from this benevolence. This fact is clearly recorded in the town's records. In a document submitted by Funa-machi to the castle lord in Kan'en 3 [1750], regarding events during Hōei 5 [1708], namely during Narihide's time, it states:

"When constructing ships for Edo transport, by the castle lord's grace, we were granted loans of 100 ryō per ship as relief, to be repaid at 20 ryō per year over five years.

We humbly and gratefully submit this payment."

This method of encouraging shipbuilding first began during Narihide's time, and from then on, successive domain lords all followed this practice. Our Toyohashi citizens benefited considerably from this benevolence. Particularly since Funa-machi served as the sole port, ships large and small all converged under Ō-hashi, making it a center for commodity distribution and gradually reaching the height of prosperity, as is clearly evident from various records that remain today.

**Repair of Water and Sewerage Systems**
As such, Narihide's era saw many commendable civil administration achievements, and the sewerage system that remains in our Toyohashi city today was also renovated during Hōei 5 [1708], in this same period of Narihide. Originally, our current Toyohashi sewerage system is quite ancient, and I believe it was gradually planned during the respective periods of Sakai Tadatsugu and Ikeda Terumasa. On one hand, it drew water from Ōike pond in Kawara-machi to serve as irrigation water for rice fields, and the fact that it passes through the city in several channels, serving dual purposes as both irrigation and sewerage, shows considerable ingenuity. During the 8th month of Genroku 6 [1693], under Ogasawara Sado-no-kami Nagashige, it was organized once and regulations were established, but now during Narihide's time, renovation was again attempted to achieve even better organization. Fortunately, the drawings from that time are still preserved in Ishikasa-machi ōaza - these are most valuable and serve as highly useful reference maps for today's administration. Related records also remain, which were in the possession of Tomita Naohei of Kaji ōaza, but copies were also made for our city office. Though it may be rather lengthy, since sewerage improvement is currently an urgent matter for our city and I think it is most interesting, I will present the complete text below.

**Regarding Town Water Channels**

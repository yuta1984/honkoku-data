　　　　　　of that sort exists. There are also works like "Butoku Taiseki" (Great Record of Military Virtue). Of course, among the "Mikawa-ki" mentioned earlier, there are some that have undergone thorough editing,
　　　　　　but these are mostly of the same nature. There are also works like "Butoku Hennen Shūsei" (Chronological Compilation of Military Virtue), and the famous "Hankanfu" (Records of Feudal Lords) by Arai Hakuseki.
　　　　　　There is also "Isshi" by Nakai Chikuzan. There are countless others of this type, but the Tokugawa shogunate established official historians
Kan'ei Keizu　　and spent much time investigating and compiling records. The "Kan'ei Keizu" (Kan'ei Genealogies) from the time of the third shogun is one such work, but this
　　　　　　still seems insufficient. However, during the time of the fifth shogun Tsunayoshi, all daimyo and direct retainers, as well as local samurai,
Jōkyō Kakiage　　were ordered to investigate their genealogies and submit records of their ancestors, which is called "Jōkyō Kakiage" and is now preserved at
　　　　　　Tokyo Imperial University's Historical Materials Compilation Office. The fashion for investigating genealogies saying "such-and-such domain has so many mounted warriors" actually
　　　　　　became popular around this time, so among the records circulating locally, quite a few were deliberately fabricated, requiring considerable caution.
　　　　　　When we gradually research the records continuously discovered in our region, many turn out to have been created after this period.
　　　　　　Later, the shogunate began historical research again in the famous Kansei era, when the young councilor Hotta Masaatsu
《Interlinear: Kansei Chōshū Shokafu》　　　served as director and completed the great "Kansei Chōshū Shokafu" (Kansei Revised Genealogies of Various Houses) in 1,525 volumes, which took until the Bunka era to complete.
　　　　　　Following this came the "Tokugawa Gojitsuki" (True Records of the Tokugawa) and "Chōya Kyūbun Hōkō" (Collected Old Stories from Court and Country), both
　　　　　　massive works of over 1,000 volumes each, compiled under the supervision of Hayashi Daigaku-no-kami Jutsu-sai, with Narushima Jichoku and others handling the compilation.
　　　　　　Given this situation, to obtain historical facts about our region, we have no choice but to investigate widely across all these various works, beginning with contemporary diaries and essays
　　　　　　like "Chikamoto Nikki" and "Shūchō Shuki." This becomes so specialized that someone with shallow learning like myself
　　　　　　cannot possibly manage it. The above is just an outline of the main points, but I would like you to understand this in advance.
Kohaku's Descendants　For reference materials regarding this period, the situation is as described above, but for research into Kohaku and the Makino family,

　　　　　　it is extremely necessary to first seek out their descendants and investigate their houses. So as a trial, let us see how many houses among the current nobility
　　　　　　bear the Makino surname - there are five houses. These are all viscount houses, and listing them one by one:
　　　　　　the Makino family of the former Echigo Nagaoka domain, the Makino family of Echigo Mineyama domain, the Makino family of Shinshū Komoro domain, the Makino family of Hitachi Kasama domain,
Makino Viscount Houses　and the Makino family of Tango Tanabe, presently Maizuru domain. All of these trace their ancestors to Higashi-Mikawa, rising to prominence centered around Ushikubo in Hoi District.
　　　　　　Among these, the three houses of Kasama, Mineyama, and Komoro originally branched from the Nagaoka house, so they share the same
　　　　　　ancestors, tracing their lineage to a man called Makino Shinjirō, later known as Uma-no-suke Narisada. I will discuss this man's biography in detail
　　　　　　later, but he later served Tokugawa Ieyasu. The Makino family of Tango Tanabe has a current head called Lord Sukeshige,
　　　　　　and this house traces its ancestry to Makino Hachidayū, later called Yamashiro-no-kami Sadashige. This man came later than Narisada
　　　　　　and was the first to serve Ieyasu, and according to their genealogy, he was Kohaku's grandson. What is interesting is that this house has traditionally
　　　　　　read the character "成" as "Shige," while the Nagaoka house lineage always reads it as "Nari," thus naturally clarifying their lineage.
　　　　　　Particularly since Kohaku's given name was Shigetoki, read as "Shigetoki," this makes the Tanabe house genealogy
　　　　　　quite convincing, and it seems beyond doubt that they are of Kohaku's lineage. However, both the Nagaoka house lineage and
　　　　　　the Tanabe house have long-standing debates about their ancestors, with different theories appearing in the "Kansei Chōshū-fu" and "Butoku Hennen Shūsei," but
　　　　　　I will discuss this at a later date. Besides these, there is another house recognized as direct descendants of Kohaku. This is a samurai
Makino Narukazu　family from Shizuoka Prefecture, the Makino Narukazu family. Narukazu's father is named Nariyuki and is still alive, residing in Masago-chō in Tokyo's Hongō ward.
　　　　　　During the Restoration he held the title Iyo-no-kami and was a 3,000-koku direct retainer. This house has traditionally used the name Denzō, also reading the character "成"
　　　　　　as "Shige." There was also a man named Makino Ono-no-jō who lived in the Hamamatsu area and was a 500-koku direct retainer before the Restoration,
　　　　　　but he branched off from Narukazu's house. That is, this Iyo-no-kami house appears in both the "Kansei Chōshū Kafu" and the Imperial

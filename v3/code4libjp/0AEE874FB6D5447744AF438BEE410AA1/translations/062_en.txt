had his castle in Fukauzu, Hoi District. His grandfather Ōisuke Yoshikage, as previously mentioned, had died in battle fighting against the forces of Kira Yoshiakira at Zenmyōji-tsutsumi in Hazu District, and his father Koretada died in battle at Nagashino. He himself later died defending Fushimi Castle together with Torii Mototada. Thus three generations in succession died loyally for the Tokugawa house, making this truly a family deserving of sympathy. The Matsudaira clan of Takenotani was the house of Higo-no-kami Kiyoyoshi, who was about five generations from Nobumitsu, and this person was the first to reside in Takenotani. His grandson Genba-no-kami Iekiyo was later enfeoffed as lord of this Yoshida castle, so I plan to discuss the details when we reach that period. The Katanohara Matsudaira descended from Nobumitsu's fifth son, Sado-no-kami Okitsugu, who was initially called Iwazu-dono. During the Yoshida battle, it was the time of Kii-no-kami Ietsugu. This person was Okitsugu's great-great-great-grandson, his father was called Kii-no-kami Ietada, and his son was Kii-no-kami Ienobu. These people also devoted loyal service to the Tokugawa house, and this family too later joined the ranks of daimyo.

Next concerns the Honda clan of Ina. The Honda clan originally belonged to the Fujiwara lineage, and it is said that a person named Sukehide, the twelfth-generation descendant of Kujō Kampaku Morosuke, lived in a place called Honda in Bungo Province and took Honda as his clan name. His son Sukesada came to Owari Province, and his sixth-generation descendant Suketoki was the first to come to Mikawa Province and serve Matsudaira Nagachika - this is the commonly transmitted account. The house of Heihachirō Tadakatsu, the house of Bungo-no-kami Hirotaka that I mentioned earlier, and the house of Sakuzaemon Shigetsugu were all of the same clan, originally branches of each other. The Honda clan of Ina traced their ancestry to a person named Masatoki, whose son was Masasuke, and whose grandson was Nuinodosuke Masatada. This person died in Tenbun 22, but when Matsudaira Kiyoyasu attacked Makino Denzō Nobushige and others at Yoshida Castle, he belonged to Kiyoyasu from the beginning and achieved many military merits.

The Theory of the Aoi Crest: According to tradition, at this time Masatada invited Kiyoyasu to his castle in Ina, offered him sake and delicacies, and served them on plates garnished with water aoi (hollyhock) leaves from the pond. Seeing this, Kiyoyasu said, "The standing aoi is the crest of the Honda house, and this victory came because Masatada was the first to

take our side. This is truly auspicious," and from then on the Tokugawa clan began using the three-aoi crest. However, regarding the Tokugawa family's three-aoi crest, there have been various confused theories since ancient times with hardly any certain account. Besides the above theory, it is also said that this aoi crest was first presented by the house of Sakai Saemon-no-jō, or from the house of Sakai Utanokami, or from the house of Honda Nakatsukatayū, or was献上d by an old man from Takariki village - various theories circulate. Originally there is a theory that the Nitta family had long used the aoi crest. There is also a theory that the Matsudaira clan had already used the aoi as their crest even before Kiyoyasu's time. The book "Kyūkō Yoroku" written by Takeo Tsuguharu during the Bunsei period contains quite detailed research on this matter. Therefore, the matter of the aoi crest still has considerable room for research and should not be relied upon solely on popular legends.

Now, Masatada's son was Tadatoshi, and Tadatoshi's sons were Mitsutada and Tadatsugu, but due to Mitsutada's illness, his younger brother Tadatsugu succeeded their father. In any case, this house had for generations devoted loyal service to the Tokugawa clan, but Tadatsugu's son Yasutoshi was actually the son of Sakai Saemon-no-jō Tadatsugu and became an adopted son of the Honda house. There are many stories about these people too, but I would like to relate them gradually as occasions arise. Among the other houses besides those mentioned, there are families like the Saigō clan that I would like to discuss, but since I believe I have already roughly covered them in the previous chapter, I will stop this discussion here and return to the situation after Sakai Tadatsugu entered Yoshida Castle, which I wish to discuss from the next chapter.

◉The Decline of the Imagawa Clan and the Invasion of the Takeda Clan

As stated in the previous chapter, Yoshida Castle finally fell into the hands of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the third month of Eiroku 8, and Ieyasu gave it to Sakai Tadatsugu. The Imagawa retainer Ohara Shigesane, after surrendering this castle, temporarily resided at Uzuyama Castle in Tōtōmi. Later he went to Hana in Suruga Province

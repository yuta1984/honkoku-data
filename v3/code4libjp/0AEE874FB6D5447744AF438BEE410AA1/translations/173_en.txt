Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Matsudaira Nobuaki and Shirakawa Rakuō-kō) 318

...upper residence was confiscated - the so-called Tanuma punishment - and we can glimpse the situation at that time. When Tanuma evacuated his Kandabashi upper residence, it was quite a commotion, but this order was given on the 5th of intercalary October, and in the letter dated intercalary October 21st it says: "Regarding Tanuma's lenient punishment, it is a fortunate matter - surely peaceful resolution would be best. I heard there was much confusion during the moving." Also in the aforementioned 18th letter, the following is written to Nobuaki:

"I am moved by your constant diligent practice. You should continue to exert yourself fully. Toda also speaks of being impressed by your talents and virtue. You must not neglect your keen intelligence. I am most delighted to hear of your diligent study of books. They say that ignorance faces a wall, and without learning and skill, success is difficult to achieve."

From this we can see that Nobuaki was indeed a brilliant young man overflowing with talent at that time, and we can also understand Sadanobu's character. The friendship between these two men becomes even clearer, and regarding this matter, in the intercalary October 21st letter it also says:

"However, this must be kept highly secret - even showing it to Kanō-shi would be most inadvisable. Please do not show it to others or speak of it. If this is not observed, my sincere intentions will come to naught... After you alone have read it, please return it immediately. Do not speak of it to others. I wish to submit this for your exclusive perusal. The intent is that you advance in important duties and restore the days of Kyōhō and Keichō - this is a document expressing my heartfelt wish."

Since even the trusted Kanō Tōtōmi-no-kami was not to see this extremely secret document that Sadanobu specially sent to Nobuaki, we must conclude that his friendship with Nobuaki was by no means ordinary. What I find particularly interesting is that in a letter believed to be from mid-September, he writes: "I am just now in the middle of eating my evening meal, so please forgive this brief response." This...

...not only shows us their usual friendship but also reveals Sadanobu's open and cheerful disposition.

In any case, the friendship between Sadanobu and Nobuaki in their youth and the circumstances of that time were as described above. After Tanuma was finally dismissed and Ienari assumed the position of 11th shogun, on June 19th of the following year (Tenmei 7), Sadanobu was finally appointed as senior councilor and took the senior position. On March 4th of Tenmei 8, because the shogun was still young and weak, he was specially appointed to the position of regent to oversee all government affairs. This was, as I mentioned before, a time when major shogunal reform was needed after the corrupt Tanuma administration, and the three branch families and others had doubts, concluding that only Sadanobu could be called upon. This was likely the result of such trends. Soon after Sadanobu assumed this important position, on October 2nd of Tenmei 7, Tanuma Okitsugu had another 27,000 koku of land confiscated for numerous improprieties during his tenure, and his castle at Sagara in Tōtōmi Province was seized, bringing the Tanuma affair to a conclusion. Sadanobu then appointed Kanō Tōtōmi-no-kami Hisanori (whom I mentioned earlier) as a personal attendant, made Honda Danjō-shōyū Tadakazu a wakadoshiyori, and in the 2nd month of Tenmei 8, elevated Nobuaki to personal aide, and within barely two months promoted him to senior councilor. Nobuaki was only 26 years old at this time, but from then on he assisted Sadanobu in participating in national governance. The so-called Kansei administration was promoted by these men.

⦿The Imperial Title Incident and Nobuaki

Now, since Sadanobu was appointed to important office, as described in the previous chapter, he gradually appointed suitable people to key positions, political affairs were progressively reformed, and the corrupt practices of the Tanuma era were almost entirely swept away. The Tenmei era name also...

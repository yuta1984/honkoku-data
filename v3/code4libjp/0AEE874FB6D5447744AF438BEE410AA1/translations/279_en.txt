　　　　　　　　First, regarding the Lord of Chōshū, patriots throughout the realm are indignant, and when I gradually met with retainers from your domain, I found them deeply moved by your unwavering righteousness. At that academy, ancient learning is exclusively practiced, and in August, a person named Katayama Kan'ichirō came down by lord's command. About forty ryō in total for my materials was received, and all manuscript copies were also needed, but I couldn't manage the arrangements and barely sent five or six copies.
　　　　　　　　First, regarding the wooden statue incident, Morooka is reportedly in good health, Nishikawa is also doing well these days without incident, and although they say Nagao died in prison, I hear he is actually safe, and all others are reportedly safe as well.
　　　　　　　　The above five points came from the same person, who asked me to give his regards to you. I wanted to mention these matters on this good occasion and also inquire about your health during this season. Please give my regards to your mother and everyone else.
　　　　　　　　My family also asked me to send regards to everyone. It's already been four or five days, and I hope you will persevere through this and that we may exchange thoughts come spring.

　　　　　　　　(Note) This letter appears to be from Bunkyū 3 (1863), and Okada Izō is Okada Izō, undoubtedly a loyalist from Tosa. The final passages about "Lord of Chōshū," "wooden statue incident," etc., refer to reports from Hirata (probably Tetsutane, the adopted son of Atsutane). The "wooden statue incident" undoubtedly refers to the incident where Ashikaga Takauji's wooden statue was removed from Kyoto's Tōji-in temple and its head was cut off. The omitted section contains sensitive material and was regrettably excluded.

　　　　　　　　Postscript: Regarding Lord Hitotsubashi's death, have you heard any interesting theories? I would like to know. The imperial edict to the Chōshū house on August 18th, their response, and their second response; Lord Sanjō and others reported and departed together for their home domain; the circular distributed throughout Yamato Province by the Tenchū group; the petition from the Tōdō house for pacification of the Yamato uprising, etc. - the other day Saitō-suke brought copies which I transcribed. I'm sure you have seen them. Recently there have been continuous express messengers, so there must certainly have been changes in the Kantō region. How are things? I would like to know. Please examine the enclosed (unclear). No need to keep it long - please return it quickly.

　　　　　　　　　(Note) This letter was sent by Sakaki from his home in Toyohashi (Hada) to Iida Takebei in Arai, Tōtōmi Province, and is from Bunkyū 3 (1863).
　　　　　　　　　(preceding part omitted)
　　　　　　　　　The other day I met with the master chronicler Ken-yūki and heard various interesting stories. Since he stayed one night at your house, I imagine you must have copied some rare documents. Please share this information with me.
　　　　　　　　　I heard from Ōyama that two volumes of "Historical Poetry" from Mr. Hirata arrived by eel boat at your location, so please send them at your convenience. Also, I have acquired about eighty sets of various sword fittings that were requested for my son - I would like to send these as well. Should I leave them at Sanzō-en? Please consider this.

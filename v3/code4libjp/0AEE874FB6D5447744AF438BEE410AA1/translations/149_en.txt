**Main Text:**
according to instructions, and it is unnecessary to go around to temples, shrines, towns, and rural areas making announcements without reason. This principle has also been communicated to temples, shrines, towns, and rural areas.

Addition: If townspeople or rural residents commit any improper acts, this should be secretly reported to officials. Since notices have been posted in towns and rural areas that if lower-ranking retainers commit violent acts, complaints should be filed from those locations, this matter should be communicated to the lower ranks.

1. One should take care not to let residences fall into disrepair. If the previous lord has let the residence deteriorate, it should be repaired promptly and appropriately.

1. Fire prevention should be taken seriously, and fire-fighting equipment appropriate to one's station should be stored, with water buckets hung in each residence.

1. There is no problem with hunting. However, one should not travel to distant places and become so absorbed in hunting as to neglect one's duties.

Addition: Improper entertainment and drinking to excess are of course forbidden. Since firearms for hunting are prohibited by government law, this is strictly forbidden. These matters should be strictly communicated to all lower ranks, and gambling should also be severely prohibited.

1. When serving guard duty on rotation, all matters during travel should be conducted with restraint, lower ranks should avoid violence, and expenses for horses and lodging should be kept reasonable during travel.

The above should be strictly observed.

To Temple and Shrine Officials
Memorandum

1. Even if they are parishioners, it is unnecessary to invite retainers without reason or have them make rounds. Since this matter has been communicated to the retainer band, this should be understood. Even if acquaintances come from elsewhere, it is unnecessary to provide lodging without reporting to officials, or to harbor rōnin. Even if the circumstances seem legitimate, if there are suspicious aspects, they should be reported to officials.

Addition: Fire prevention should be taken seriously, and all forms of gambling should be strictly prohibited among the lower ranks.

1. Ancient treasures are a separate matter; new weapons should not be stored. If there are donations from retainers or the surrounding area, they should be reported to officials.

1. When there are legal disputes or lawsuits and one needs to go to Edo, officials should first be informed. Even if this varies by case, this is not for the purpose of detention. Since it would be improper not to be informed at all, one should definitely notify officials.

1. It is unnecessary to harbor those involved in legal disputes or those with criminal records, or to mediate for them. If there are unavoidable circumstances, it depends on the case.

1. If there are legitimate reasons for soliciting donations, that is a separate matter. If solicitations are made improperly, depending on the case, instructions should be given not to allow townspeople and rural residents to participate in donation drives, as this would become pointless. This should be understood.

Addition: One should not make various claims under the guise of divine oracles or dream visions, and this should be communicated to the lower ranks.

The above principles should be understood.

To Towns and Rural Areas
Regulations

1. Government prohibitions should be strictly observed. Be harmonious with relatives and relations, show compassion even to servants, and ensure that even beggars and the destitute can maintain livelihoods appropriate to their station. Leading figures in each town and village should ensure there are no homeless people without shelter.

1. Do not form factions or engage in various disputes and schemes.

1. Stipend recipients should not commit improper acts against anyone, no matter how lowly.

1. When traveling to distant places on business, permission should be obtained from the leading figures of that area. If there are disputes with other domains and it becomes necessary to go to Edo, this should be reported to the respective local and town officials before departing.

Addition: When departing with official papers, this is of course required.

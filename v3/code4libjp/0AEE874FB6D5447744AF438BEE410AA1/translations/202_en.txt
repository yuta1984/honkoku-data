Now regarding notable figures of Yoshida during this period, as scholars there were Ōta Kinjō and Nishioka Zensuke, as I mentioned earlier. I believe there were other worthy individuals among the domain retainers as well, but there is nothing particularly noteworthy to discuss here.

Of course, regarding the Ōkōchi family retainers, there are very detailed records in the Ōkōchi family storehouse, so based on these I would like to discuss various matters. Not only that, but I would also like to gradually discuss what kinds of official positions existed in this domain, starting with the senior councilor (kuni-karō), how domain administration was conducted, and what kinds of people held these various positions.

However, since I intend to first present only the main outline, I would like to defer such detailed matters until the end of the Ōkōchi family discussion and present them comprehensively at that time. Therefore, I would like to briefly mention this disclaimer for now.

**Notable Townspeople of the Era:**

Now, among the townspeople of Yoshida during this period, there were some skilled in flower arrangement. One was a person called Shijian Hokurai, who was the head priest of Kannon-ji temple located in Kasumachi at that time. He was a direct disciple of Zeshinken Ichirō-ō, founder of the Shōgetsu-dō ancient school, and received his license in the 9th month of An'ei 8 (1779). The name "Shijian" has been passed down through successive generations, and even today it remains a respected name in that art.

Another was a person from Kanejaku-temachi named Onda Sanshō. He was also a disciple of Zeshinken and received his license as head of all provinces (shokoku kaitō) in Tenmei 2 (1782). His common name was Tasōta, his given name was Manshin, his courtesy name was Shishin, and his artistic name was Shin'ōken. Regarding flower arrangement, he wrote various works...

...including "Illustrations of San'en Flower Arrangements" and "Oral Traditions of Flower Arrangement," which are particularly famous. He is said to have had over a thousand disciples and died of illness in the 9th month of Bunka 7 (1810) at age 67.

**Satō Nankan:** Next I would like to discuss Satō Nankan, a resident of Funamachi who operated a shipping business and was commonly known as Shinbei. His family still exists today, and the current head is also called Satō Shinpei. Nankan's given name was Kidō, courtesy name Jakusui, and he used the artistic names Kyokkōsai or Bunkai-dō shujin. "Nankan" was also one of his names, but since his house was near Yoshida Great Bridge, he playfully also used "Rankan" (balustrade).

He was a disciple of Maruyama Ōkyo, skilled in painting, and also versed in literature, maintaining friendship with the famous Kyokutei Bakin. Even now, the family preserves a painting by Nankan with an inscription by Bakin. He died of illness in the 4th month of Tenmei 7 (1787) at age 42, much mourned by all.

**Hattori Yasuke:** Around the same time, also in Funamachi, among the ancestors of the current Mr. Hattori Yahachi was a man named Hattori Yasuke, who was truly a master of martial arts and a person of great chivalrous spirit. His jujutsu was of the Asakawa Ichiden school, and whether in swordsmanship or staff techniques, there was no secret art he had not mastered, making him truly renowned. His shop name being "Igaya," people called him "Igasuke."

He had many martial arts disciples and constantly traveled throughout the provinces with his martial arts. His adventures are extremely numerous, like hearing the old tales of the Three Heroes of Genna. A travel journal he wrote himself remains in the Hattori family house, with sketches drawn in various places, which I find quite interesting. He died of illness on September 16, Bunka 14 (1817) at age 82.

**Swordsmith Shigeyoshi:** Among others, there was a swordsmith named Shigeyoshi in Yoshida who was quite a renowned craftsman. One sword he forged is now preserved in the Ōkōchi family collection, inscribed with "Bunka 10, 8th month," but unfortunately I cannot quite determine details of his biography. I hope to search for materials about him in the future, and would appreciate guidance from anyone with knowledge of him.

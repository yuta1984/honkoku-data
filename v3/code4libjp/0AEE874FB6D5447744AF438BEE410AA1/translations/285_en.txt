　　　　　　Based on this opinion, the matter was reported up to the Kampaku (regent). However, the National Affairs officials considered the shogunate's handling of this matter to be a disregard for the court's fundamental policy of expelling foreigners, and concluded it could not be overlooked, so eventually a letter of inquiry was issued from the Kampaku. The shogunate then maintained the facade to the court that it would not pay compensation, but in reality paid it and placed the blame on the responsible party, Ogasawara Zusho-no-kami, censuring his arbitrary decision. However, when this internal situation also became known to the National Affairs officials, the shogunate found itself facing censure, creating yet another confusion. As a result, Ogasawara Zusho-no-kami departed Edo with troops on May 19th, secretly heading west by sea, apparently with some scheme in mind. But when this news also reached Kyoto, it became quite a troublesome matter. The shogun, claiming he would personally deal with this Zusho-no-kami, hurried down to Osaka again on June 9th, summoning the Zusho-no-kami who had arrived by sea repeatedly to the castle for meetings. The result was that on the 9th, the Zusho-no-kami was relieved of his senior counselor position and placed in the custody of Nobuhisa, the Osaka castle commander. This difficult punishment brought temporary resolution to the matter, but the shogun did not return to Kyoto; instead, on the 13th he departed Osaka and returned directly to Edo by sea. With the main shogunal officials gradually returning east, the sonnō-jōi party now faced no obstacles and increasingly advanced their plans, eventually reaching the point of plotting to raise an army for overthrowing the shogunate under the name of an imperial expedition to expel foreigners. As their first step, they petitioned for an imperial visit to Yamato province. Whether the imperial will truly accepted this is, though it may be presumptuous to say, genuinely questionable. Public opinion in Kyoto was also heated regarding its appropriateness, but those in the leading position were undoubtedly from Chōshū domain, and ultimately the radical faction's plans continued to advance. At this point, the world had completely become that of young radicals; mature and moderate opinions could not possibly be adopted, and even imperial family members who harbored moderate views were ostracized as obstacles. Thus public

　　　　　　court nobles and domain administrators were liable to face threats of drawn swords. Moreover, what the radicals advocated was mostly vague arguments about proper hierarchy - that the shogunate were traitors who had usurped political power and must return it to the imperial house without a moment's delay. Certainly this point could be called quite admirable, but having no other farsightedness or wisdom, and thus no comprehensive plan for how to handle contemporary affairs, they lost the sympathy of knowledgeable people and inevitably brought about their great failure.

　　　　　　For these reasons, even the radical faction that had until then rampaged without restraint suddenly suffered a major setback - the famous political change of August 18th (Bunkyū 3rd year). The details are that on the 17th, Prince Nakagawa-no-miya Sonfushin urgently appeared at court and reported something. The imperial will had apparently long considered the timing inappropriate for an imperial expedition to Yamato, and immediately ordered the prince to cancel the Yamato visit. Prince Nakagawa then urgently commanded the Aizu domain (serving as Kyoto protector) and Yodo domain (serving as Kyoto deputy) to enter the palace during the night to guard the imperial quarters, with similar orders given to Satsuma domain. These domains entered the palace and took their guard positions at dawn on the 18th. A single cannon shot announced the completion of preparations for all forces, and security was extremely tight. Soon Prince Nakagawa conveyed that recently the议奏 (council of state), National Affairs officials, 参政 (government officials), and 寄人 (advisors) had all trusted Chōshū's violent arguments and were attempting to force through extreme and crude measures that were not in accordance with imperial will, which greatly angered His Majesty. To pressure the emperor with such misconduct represented the height of disloyalty. Not only was there great admonishment, but Chōshū domain, which had been stationed at Sakaimachi gate, was also relieved of its guard duties. Of course, the court's policy regarding expulsion of foreigners remained unchanged from before, as evidenced by the following special proclamation.

...sumi was about to proceed ahead when he passed by that place, the local people detained two or three of Naosumi's retainers and said "Please have Kyūbē protected." Naosumi had no choice but to leave three foot soldiers to guard him, but when Kyūbē again attacked and cut down three men, someone called Jidayū killed Kyūbē. As a result, Naosumi incurred the shogun's displeasure, and Nagai Kenbutsu Hakugen was sent rushing to Kyoto to report this incident. According to the Ōuchi Diary, when Kyūbē was returning after completing his mission as an envoy, on the night of the 29th he cut down a horse handler near Yoshida, causing many local people to rise up and surround him. When Kagauri happened to pass by and saw this, Kagauri's retainer cut down Kyūbē.

**Iemitsu's Return** As for what happened during the return journey, Shogun Iemitsu donated 100 koku of additional land to Iga Hachiman in Okazaki on August 10 of that year, and arrived at Yoshida on the 11th. On this day, he granted Hayato-no-shō an increase of 5,000 koku, as recorded in the Tokugawa Jitsuroku, citing the Kinenroku and Kansei Chōshū Shokafu. However, the Hankanfu records this increase as occurring on October 17 of that year. I do not clearly understand what caused this discrepancy, but I intend to follow what is recorded in the Tokugawa Jitsuroku.

**Casting of Kan'ei New Coins** The following year, the shogunate cast new coins in Edo and Sakamoto in Ōmi Province, and from the seventh month of Kan'ei 13, these were used as general currency in exchange for old coins - these were the Kan'ei Tsūhō. At that time, the shogunate's administrators were Doi Ōi-no-kami Toshikatsu and Sakai Sanuki-no-kami Tadakatsu, and from the fifth month of the 10th year, the three men previously mentioned - Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami Nobutsuna, Abe Bungo-no-kami Tadaaki, and Hotta Kaga-no-kami Masamori - joined them in overseeing affairs. However, since there were still areas where circulation had not fully spread, in the eighth month of the 14th year, minting offices were established in various provinces to cast new coins. The official document at that time stated:

Coin Minting Offices: Mito, Sendai, Yoshida, Matsumoto, Takada, Nagato, Bizen, Bungo, within Nakagawa Naizen's domain

1. Since the amounts ordered until now are insufficient for widespread distribution, large quantities should be minted, and not only in those provinces but also in other provinces, payments should be made at the established rate of 4 kan-mon per gold ryō...

...and 1 kan-mon per 1 bu should be paid.
1. The new Kan'ei coins should exceed the original amount and be made in this manner.
1. Those who cast coins should be selected and appointed at suitable locations within their domains.
Kan'ei 14, eighth month of the year of the ox

At this time, new coins were also cast at Yoshida, and in order to count the coins produced here, special pictorial coins were cast - these are the famous "Yoshida no Komahiki" coins.

**Yoshida no Komahiki** The location of this coin casting was in present-day Shinsen-machi, and there is a story that the coin molds remained in the storehouse of the Suzuki Nobuji family until recent years.

**Shinsen-machi** However, the fact that these can no longer be found anywhere is truly most regrettable. In October of that year, the famous Higo Amakusa rebellion broke out, which took until February of the following year to finally suppress. At this time, the aforementioned Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami Nobutsuna went as the commanding general of the suppression force, as you all know, but I believe there will be opportunities to discuss this matter further when I later describe the Ōkōuchi family.

**Reconstruction of Yoshida Great Bridge** Also, in the 18th year, the great bridge over the Toyokawa was reconstructed. According to records from Funa-machi during the Hōreki period:

Kan'ei 18, year of the ox
1. Reconstruction without temporary bridge, old bridge construction
                                    Castle Lord
                                    Mizuno Hayato-no-shō-sama's Era

However, this Hayato-no-shō Tadakiyo's residence at this location lasted only eleven years, and on September 6, Kan'ei 19 (according to the Hankanfu), he received a further increase and was simultaneously transferred to Matsumoto Castle in Shinano Province with 70,000 koku. The one who subsequently came to become lord of this castle...

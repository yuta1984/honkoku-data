Rather, he even advised Yoshinaga that to make Yoshinobu's succession more viable, it would be necessary to distance themselves from Nariaki. Even under these circumstances, Mito's strategist Yasujima Tatewaki and Echizen's strategist Nakane Yukie (Yukie) constantly coordinated their efforts, devoting almost all their energy to this cause. This would later intensify due to motives I will gradually discuss.

*Subheading: Ii Naosuke and the Nanki Faction*
Now, regarding the faction supporting Kii Yoshitomi's succession, their leader was Ii Naosuke. Naosuke and Nariaki were incompatible in virtually everything. First, regarding foreign policy, Nariaki was an extreme anti-foreign advocate, while Naosuke had from the beginning argued for the necessity of opening the country. They were already opposed on this fundamental point, and had developed mutual antagonism on many other matters. Therefore, it was natural that Naosuke would not support Yoshinobu. Originally, Naosuke's opinion differed greatly from that of Yoshinaga and others - he believed that Tokugawa shoguns should not necessarily seek only brilliant individuals, but rather should be chosen from those of close bloodline and legitimate succession. He seems to have firmly believed this was the way to unify the nation's sentiment. Not only did the senior councillors and others gradually come to support this view, but most importantly, the shogun's inner quarters (ōoku) most disliked Nariaki and thus leaned toward Ii's position, making them formidable opponents for Yoshinobu's supporters.

Under such circumstances, Hayashi Daigaku-no-kami and others, who had been sent to Kyoto by the shogunate to report on foreign policy developments, not only achieved no success but actually became the starting point for the court to censure the shogunate's arbitrary actions. As mentioned earlier, the shogunate could not leave this matter unaddressed. Since a deadline had already been set for signing the treaty with Harris, the shogunate faced the difficult problem of not being able to miss this deadline. However, they first needed to obtain imperial permission.

The argument that imperial permission should be obtained had gained influence both within and outside the shogunate, so they could not oppose this either. Consequently, Senior Councillor Hotta was forced to go to Kyoto himself to settle these matters, and on the 8th day of the 1st month of Ansei 5 (1858), orders were issued for Kawaji Saemon-no-jō and Iwase Higo-no-kami to accompany him. This too, as I mentioned earlier, would create serious discord with the shogunate's expectations.

As I have repeatedly mentioned, the Tokugawa realm had enjoyed prolonged peace, but various factors had gradually created tendencies toward power shifts. Particularly, archaic or historical scholarly traditions like those of the Motoori and Hirata schools and the Mito school of thought gradually influenced general public sentiment and deeply penetrated court noble circles. Originally, among the country's scholars, there were many who possessed valuable talents but could not extend their abilities and remained obscurely hidden in the grassroots. For these people, contemporary society was naturally unbearable in its frustration and dissatisfaction.

*Subheading: Loyalist Activists' Persuasion Efforts in Kyoto*
Therefore, they all the more argued for the necessity of expelling foreigners when foreign ships arrived and criticized the times. These people gradually infiltrated court noble and imperial family circles and actively engaged in persuasion. At that time, these groups were called "imperial family supporters," but in reality their hidden influence was not to be underestimated. Moreover, four or five major domains harbored resentment and ambition behind the scenes, so their foundation had to be considered quite serious. However, the shogunate somewhat misjudged this internal situation. In other words, they took the court nobles' fervor and these hidden forces far too lightly. This was their fundamental error.

*Subheading: Senior Councillor Hotta's Entry into Kyoto*
Now, Senior Councillor Hotta and others all entered Kyoto on the 4th and 5th of the 2nd month, lodged at Honno-ji temple, and first had an audience with the emperor on the 9th. Through the court transmitters, they briefly explained the foreign policy situation, stating that overseas circumstances made it impossible for the nation to maintain its old laws, and therefore they had no choice but to conclude a treaty with America. Consequently, they requested imperial permission for this.

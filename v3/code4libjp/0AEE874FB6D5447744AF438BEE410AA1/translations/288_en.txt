　　　　　　Thus it was decided that [punitive forces] should be dispatched, and their deployment was roughly determined. However, Chōshū domain had initially planned things impulsively, attempting to use the same methods by which they themselves had been expelled all at once on August 18th of the previous year, but this time in reverse - to expel the court-shogunate cooperation party and achieve success for themselves. Unfortunately, this first strategy immediately became known to the other side and ended in spectacular failure. This was the story of July 18th, Genji 1, but then on the following 19th, a unit of Chōshū domain unexpectedly clashed with the guard troops of Ōgaki domain at Fushimi, opening hostilities. This immediately became the trigger for a great battle to begin. At this time, Aizu domain was defending the Hamaguri Gate of the imperial palace. The fighting in this area was quite fierce, but as mentioned previously, Satsuma domain's intention was that even if they might ally [with Chōshū] in the future, at this time they should first punish Chōshū domain, so they naturally aided Aizu and Kuwana domains in attacking [Chōshū] from the flank. Consequently, much of Kyoto city was burned away due to the extremely violent street fighting, but ultimately Chōshū domain was defeated. This was the cause of Chōshū domain falling into increasingly adverse circumstances, and also became the primary reason for raising the Chōshū Punitive Army.

　　　　　　At that time, this fighting was not limited to Kyoto city alone - since part of Chōshū forces had established themselves at Mount Tennō in Yamazaki, the people's hearts in Osaka were also truly filled with trepidation. At this time, Yoshida domain deployed troops to Kyōbashi-guchi for guard duty, but prior to this they had already summoned reinforcements from the domain to Osaka. According to the direct account of elder Miura Hekisui, he too went to Osaka during this reinforcement, traveling there in just two days and nights.

　　　　　　What was described in the previous chapter concerned the situation of the realm from around August of Bunkyū 2 to around June of Bunkyū 4, that is, Genji 1, but

　　　　　　now, what attitude did our Yoshida domain take during that time? Here I would like to outline the main points. Of course, at that time, as already mentioned in the previous chapter, Yoshida castle lord Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobuhisa was serving as Osaka castle deputy and residing in Osaka castle. He received his appointment as castle deputy on the last day of June, Bunkyū 2, as I briefly mentioned before. At the same time, Nobuhisa was elevated to fourth court rank, but soon after, as you know, there was the matter of the imperial envoy Middle Counselor Sanjō and others going east, and the shogunate underwent major changes. These events seem to have been related, as Nobuhisa's assignment to Osaka was considerably delayed - he finally departed Edo on September 2nd of that year, traveled west via the Tōkaidō, and arrived in Osaka on the 19th of that month.

Of course, detailed records about that time remain in the Ōkōchi family, but since it would become too lengthy, I plan to omit the details and speak only generally. In any case, that period was when expulsion theory was at its most vigorous, and the rampage of rōnin had reached its extreme. On December 4th of that year, Matsudaira Katamori entered Kyoto as Kyoto Protector, and Hitotsubashi Yoshinobu, who was shogunal guardian at the time, as well as Matsudaira Yoshinaga as chief of political affairs, also entered Kyoto. Then the following year, that is, on March 4th of Bunkyū 3, Shogun Iemochi also went up to Kyoto and entered Nijō Castle. On the 7th of that month, he entered the palace and received the imperial edict for expelling foreigners. For these reasons, the fervor of expulsion advocates became increasingly intense. Particularly, according to the imperial edict at that time, regarding national affairs, depending on the matter, direct imperial commands would be issued from the court to the various domains. This greatly perplexed the shogunate, and indeed afterward, regarding expulsion, there were instances where the court directly commanded domains responsible for Kyoto-Osaka security, so the Osaka castle deputy, who bore responsibility for Kansai command, frequently faced difficulties in handling these situations.

It was already June 11th of Bunkyū 3, and Shogun Iemochi happened to be in Osaka castle, having come down from Kyoto. At that time, an inquiry came from the Lord of Kii to Nobuhisa as Osaka castle deputy, which I find quite interesting. The following complete text is what Nobuhisa sent to the senior councilors at the time, requesting guidance regarding this matter.

Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Lord Makino Bizen-no-kami) 238

**Main Text:**
has already been discussed repeatedly in previous chapters, so I will not elaborate on it again in detail. However, this Yasunari was a person of considerable military achievements for the Tokugawa clan and had quite an extensive career. After Ieyasu's transfer to the Kantō region in Tenshō 18 [1590], he was enfeoffed with 20,000 koku at Ōgo in Kōzuke Province. His wife was the daughter of Sakai Saemon-no-jō Tadatsugu, and Yasunari had three sons. The eldest son was named Tadanari, who inherited the family headship and became the so-called Nagaoka Makino family, which ruled Nagaoka in Echigo Province before the Meiji Restoration. The current head is Viscount Makino Tadaatsu, a member of the House of Peers.

**The Nagaoka Makino Family**
Tadanari's younger brother was Hidenari, and his younger brother was Norinari. This Norinari established a separate branch family and died on the 5th day of the 3rd month of Manji 3 [1660] at age 55. He was appointed Mino-no-kami and held a stipend of 5,000 koku. After his death, his domain was divided between his two sons: the eldest son Narinaga received 3,000 koku and the second son Narisada received 2,000 koku. This Narisada served the 5th Shogun Tsunayoshi from when he was still at Tatebayashi, and after Tsunayoshi became shogun, he gradually received patronage, eventually joining the ranks of daimyo and coming to hold 73,000 koku at Sekijuku Castle in Shimōsa Province.

**Makino Narisada**
However, this person had no natural heir, so he adopted a retainer's son named Shikibu, the son of Ōdo Han'ya, as his successor. This was Bizen-no-kami Nariharu, whose descendants were the lords of Kasama in Hitachi Province at the time of the Meiji Restoration, represented today by Viscount Makino Teiei, a member of the House of Peers.

**The Kasama Makino Family**
Nariharu succeeded his adoptive father Narisada after his retirement in the 11th month of Genroku 8 [1695], and on the last day of the 10th month of Hōei 2 [1705], he replaced Kuze Shigeyuki as lord of Yoshida. At that time, his domain was increased to 80,000 koku. However, this person served as lord for only about one and a half years, dying on the 26th day of the 3rd month of Hōei 4 [1707] at the age of 26. Despite this brief period, he left something quite interesting for our Toyohashi.

**Yoshida Land Registry Maps**
This was none other than his ordering of a survey of Yoshida town the year after he became lord of this domain, creating precise land registry maps. Fortunately, the portions covering Funa-machi and Kaji-machi from that time are still preserved in their respective ōaza districts today. I believe these are invaluable reference materials even today. The actual documents were exhibited at our city's historical materials exhibition, so I believe some of you are already familiar with them.

**Makino Daigaku and His Administrative Achievements**

**Makino Nariharu**
After the death of Makino Bizen-no-kami Nariharu, his son Shichinosuke Narihide succeeded him, changed his name to Daigaku, and became lord of this domain. This person was later appointed Bizen-no-kami, but at the time of succession he was still young, only nine years old.

**The Great Earthquake Disaster of Hōei 4**
However, in that same year, namely on the 4th day of the 10th month of Hōei 4 [1707], the famous great earthquake disaster occurred - this was the so-called Great Hōei Earthquake. At that time, the damage throughout the provinces was extraordinary. From the 23rd of that month, Mount Fuji erupted and continued shaking until the 27th, with a new peak emerging from the mountainside - this became Hōei-zan. The situation at that time is briefly described in the Tokugawa Jikki as follows:

"At Shimoda Port in Izu Province, high tides surged due to the earthquake of the 4th, with reports of damage at various locations. The Fuji River mouth at Minobu-san in Kai Province collapsed, the harbor at Arai in Tōtōmi Province was also damaged, and among other places, no castles or post towns in the three provinces escaped this calamity. In Osaka, 10,600 private houses collapsed and about 3,020 people died or went missing. In Tosa, many rice fields are said to have been swallowed by the sea."

**Yoshida's Damage Numbers**
A record of the actual conditions in Yoshida at that time, dated the 12th day of the 4th month of Hōei 7 [1710], is preserved in a warehouse in Funa-machi ōaza, and I am also fortunate to possess one recorded in the 10th month of Hōei 7. Both documents are substantially similar with nearly identical text. According to these, Yoshida had 1,011 households at the time, and regarding this earthquake disaster, there were 310 completely destroyed houses, 266 half-destroyed houses, and 11 deaths. Also, the stone torii gate at Shinmei Shrine within the castle grounds, which had been donated earlier by Ogasawara Naganori, likewise collapsed in the great earthquake at the hour of the sheep on the 4th day of the 10th month. This was rebuilt the following year on the 20th day of the 6th month when Narihide ordered his retainer Okudaira Shichirōzaemon to reconstruct it, and the ridge plaque from that time is still preserved at the shrine today.

**Disaster Relief**
In any case, the disaster at this time was extraordinary, and as relief measures, Narihide lent money to the castle town and also reduced taxes.

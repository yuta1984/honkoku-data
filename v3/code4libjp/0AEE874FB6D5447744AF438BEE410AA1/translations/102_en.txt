pleasure." In the Yūhiroku as well, after recording that Terumasa lived an extremely frugal personal life, it states:

"From this one can understand how frugal he was at the time. He devoted his attention only to military preparations and personnel. He recruited famous masterless samurai with generous stipends and encouraged their loyalty. Once when he entered the privy, an unseemly sound was heard, so his attendants rushed in alarm to inquire about his condition. He laughed and said, 'I am always devising military strategies. I thought I had hit upon a good plan,' and told them not to be surprised, saying there was nothing to discuss." This is recorded as told by elderly retainers.

For this reason, especially after the Battle of Sekigahara, masterless samurai flocked to Terumasa's residence. Makino Denzō Narisato, whom I mentioned in the previous chapter, was one who relied on Terumasa. Terumasa treated him very favorably, took care of him thoroughly, and eventually arranged for him to meet Ieyasu and be promoted to hatamoto status. Such kindness was truly extraordinary and beyond what ordinary people could do. Because of this character, Terumasa was very lenient toward others while being strict in correcting his own mistakes. There are various sources documenting this, including records from many places showing that he reduced taxes to some extent. The following account from the Jōzankidan is quite interesting, so I will excerpt it:

"Lord Terumasa said the three treasures a military commander should value are: the farmers of his domain, hereditary retainers, and roosters. As to why: farmers cultivate fields and support all the troops, high and low - this is the first treasure. Even if hereditary retainers fall out of favor and are dismissed, enemy countries will suspect they might be spies rather than truly dismissed, so they cannot settle in enemy territory and eventually return to become our soldiers again - this is the second treasure. Visible and audible signals can be detected by enemy eyes and ears, making them difficult to use in enemy territory. But no one recognizes rooster calls as signals,

so we can use enemy roosters for signals - first crow to rouse the troops, second crow to eat, third crow to march out - establishing signals that enemies cannot recognize. This is the third treasure. These he called the three treasures."

Also, the Dai Nihon Shiryō quotes from the Ikeda Family Historical Summary with the following account, one of which apparently occurred here in Yoshida, making it particularly valuable source material:

"This happened in Mikawa. Once when a celebratory noh performance was arranged, he announced: 'Today you may praise as loudly as you wish without offense. But if anyone quarrels, they will be punished regardless of who is right or wrong.' He himself was performing when a quarrel broke out among the audience and they began grappling. Hatta Hachizō, Kajiura Tarōbei and others rushed to calm them, detained both parties, and returned to report. When asked what the commotion was about, Tarōbei said, 'Someone was choking on pepper and we were helping him. From a distance it truly looked like a fight.' Lord Kokusei said, 'Is he alright now? Go check and return.' Tarōbei reported that all was well. That evening when the two men came to pay their respects, he said, 'Today's pepper was quite an incident.' This same lord was fond of water celery, considering that grown in Mino District of Bizen Province to be the finest, and forbade harvesting it. When a certain samurai was caught stealing it, the farmers reported this to Hagita Shōsuke, who in turn reported it. The lord asked, 'That's detestable - did he just take it or actually steal it?' Shōsuke replied it was theft. The lord said again, 'If he took what I had forbidden, it is all the more detestable. But since he stole it, he must be as fond of celery as I am. Leave the matter as it is.'"

Thus Terumasa was compassionate to the people and loving toward his retainers, showing great magnanimity in his conduct, and was also good at correcting his mistakes. As an example of the latter, the Biyō Bugi Zatsudan contains this account:

"Hatta Bungo possessed a sword from his home province, unsigned, two shaku three sun long. At Himeji in Harima, Lord Kokusei repeatedly ordered him to present this sword, but he refused. One night after drinking, he summoned Bungo and ordered him to produce the sword he had requested many times. Bungo said, 'As I have repeatedly declined with apologies,

This exists as well. This also truly evokes the circumstances of the journey. There are also many poems composed during his confinement in Yoshida. These are truly invaluable, so despite their numerous nature, I shall present them below:

**Miscellaneous Poems from Secluded Residence in the Shadow of Yoshida Castle**

"Foul wind, cold branches, sunlight sinks / Ancient pines and old cypresses, green and rustling / Sitting silently at one window through morning and evening / Many small birds bring good tidings"

"Poetry collections of Tao and Du, anthologies of Han and Li / What heart is there in various commentaries? / Before my eyes I see no vicissitudes of change / How can I fathom the profound intentions of ancient sages?"

"Thatch rafters drip with rain, night rustling / One wick of cold lamp, I trim myself / Without gaining Zhuangzi's equanimous view / How can these months and years be spent?"

"An ice-pure heart, one piece, bright as jade pot / Why ask whether fame and achievement succeed or not? / I admire Master Fan of Stone Lake / Shall I transform laments into harmony?"

"Cold威 severe and piercing, goosebumps on skin / Night snow before the lamp, sleepless time / Again stirring foolish heart thinking of ancient divination / At what desolate post station do wife and children lodge?"

**堂　　堂 (Dignified)**
"Dignified yet failing this manly body / Confined in one room for how many weeks? / Cannot bear to make wife and children toil in distant dreams / Ashamed before siblings who care for loving parents / No confidant in the world, lazy in composing poetry / Heart harboring deep worries, frequently thinking of wine / Yet seeking pleasure amid suffering / What kind of men were Dongpo and Taibai?"

**New Year's Day of Gengshen**
"Joyfully congratulating each other on peaceful spring / I imagine the capital's scenery renewed / My children and wife truly have thin fate / Unknown in what condition they pass this morning"

This Toyohashi City Historical Discourse is published once weekly (Tuesdays) and presented to readers of Sanyō Newspaper

**Main Text:**
"Great orange and cypress branches, ten-thousand-year cup / New Year has no words that aren't auspicious / Sad that New Year words don't become words / First believing the hermitage companion is truly mad"

**Hearing Spring Thunder with Feeling**
"Gate locked for over ninety days / Cannot bear the melancholy of passing dawn and dusk / Heaven has intent, do not abandon me / Truly it is spring thunder awakening hibernation time"

**Looking in Four Directions**
"Looking around solemnly, one room empty / Like an old monk beginning night meditation / In retirement, surprised the lamp flame burns well / A single sheet of paper cannot reach the homeland"

**A certain guard brought dragon and tiger fans requesting inscription, composed in response**
"Strange wind churns the sea, cloud qi silent / Between clouds sometimes see scales and armor flash / One leap soaring beyond nine heavens / Wild lightning assists with blazing light / Yet thinking of the depths where it lies high / Absolutely no traces in the deep blue waves / Alas! Transformation, appearing and hiding, truly has its time / Dragon, oh dragon, you are my teacher"

"Red lips dripping blood, iron whiskers bristling / Eye-light brilliant like golden heaven essence / Lying養 brocade spots, not lightly emerging / Tail is banner, head is fortress / One roar creates wind, all beasts cower / White sun grows dim, killing qi spreads / Alas! How to obtain warriors fierce as you / To proclaim our national might far and震 the barbarians"

When one carefully savors the above poems, the circumstances of that time of confinement seem to appear before one's eyes. Moreover, there are many more things to be said about both Kozan and Takao, but for now I shall make this a stopping point here, and later gradually supplement these matters in their appropriate chronological contexts. However, there is one more thing I would like to mention here: Takao's birth date has recently become known—it was February 14th of Kansei 10 (1798). Regarding Takao's later common name "Sakaki," he often wrote it as 栄樹 (prosperity tree) or 栄木 (prosperity wood), but the correct writing is actually 佐可喜. I mention this as well in passing.

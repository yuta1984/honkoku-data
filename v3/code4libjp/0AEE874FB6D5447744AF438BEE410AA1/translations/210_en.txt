...and caught fire. The fire reached the kagura hall and burned it down. This kagura hall stood eaves-to-eaves with Zenkurō's house, so it caught fire. However, when the fire reached the kagura hall, the dry wind immediately changed to a divine mountain wind, preventing the fire and smoke from reaching the worship hall and main shrine. Thus the main shrine, worship hall, torii, great gate, and auxiliary buildings all escaped unharmed. People said that the sudden change of the dry wind to a divine mountain wind was entirely due to divine power. On the north side of Uomachi, the fire was stopped at the house of a man named Chōkichi, who lived across from the Gongen shrine. Chōkichi's house was half-burned. The sacred object of Gongen was moved to Hakusan shrine from the dawn of November 4th when the fire started. On the night of November 4th it was placed in Hakusan's worship hall, then on the night of November 5th it was moved to Kumano shrine in Uomachi, returning to its original state. (omitted) Now, the fire that started in Honmachi spread to Fudagi-chō, Gofuku-chō, Kanejaku-te-chō, and Kaji-chō, burning all the way to the entrance of Dangū shrine. It was an unprecedented great fire.

Now, this Mutsu, son of Tosa, was also quite a remarkable person who regularly corresponded with Hirata Atsutane and others. When Ōta Kinshō accompanied Nobuyori to Yoshida, he frequently socialized with Mutsu. The poem that Kinshō presented to Mutsu still exists in the Nobuji family home, and at the end it states that although Kinshō had many acquaintances in Yoshida, he thought there was no one of Mutsu's caliber among them. It appears that Kinshō greatly trusted Mutsu's character.

**Correction**
At the beginning of this chapter I mentioned the painter Yamada Dōsetsu, but that was completely wrong - it should have been the painter Yokoyama Bundō. I mistook the name. However, the facts about the matter are correct, so I would like to correct only the name here.

**The Monk Ryōgan**
Continuing from this, I would like to discuss the monk called Ryōgan. This man was the head priest of Jōenji temple in present-day Hanazono-chō and took the name Hōun-an. Born in Meiwa 3, he loved learning from childhood, excelled in poetry and prose, and was also skilled at waka. Initially he studied under someone called Saishin-in Gitō (this person is somewhat unclear), but later went to Kyoto, entered Takakura College, and studied under various great masters like Chizan and Senzan, mastering the profound secrets of Kegon, Tendai, Esoteric Buddhism, Zen, Kusha, and Hossō schools. He was later appointed dormitory supervisor of the same college, but soon returned home and established a academy

...within Jōenji temple, devoting all his energy to educating disciples. Afterwards he was invited to Kyoto several times but never accepted. In Bunka 1 he built a sutra repository in the temple grounds to house the complete Buddhist canon, which required considerable effort from Ryōgan. Only that repository remains today. He also translated the "Larger Sukhāvatīvyūha Sutra" into waka and published it, among other noteworthy achievements. His writings include the 12-volume "Abbreviated Commentary on the Larger Sukhāvatīvyūha Sutra," and his calligraphy shows a distinctive spirit and elegance that is quite admirable. He died in the 12th month of Bunsei 5 at age 57, never having married.

**Taichin Hōsen**
Also around that time, Ryūnenji temple had a head priest named Taichin Hōsen, who was also quite a distinguished monk and became an object of devotion for both clergy and laity. After his death, his disciple, a monk named Nyozan, collected the teachings that Hōsen had expounded during his lifetime into a single work called "Wakumon Shitenshoku." This work still exists and circulates among Zen scholars. This man died in the 10th month of Bunsei 3 at age 73, so his prime years were during Nobuaki's administration.

**Ōguchi Sankan**
Next I would like to briefly mention Ōguchi Sankan, though I hesitate to discuss him here since he was my ancestor. He was actually a rare calligrapher who was frequently rewarded by the domain during Nobuaki's time. His childhood names were Shūsaku or Hitomi, and he was originally the son of Satō Ichijūrō from the same neighborhood, but was adopted into my family from childhood. A six-panel folding screen he wrote at age fifteen still remains in my family home and is entirely in the style of Mi Fu. At that time a calligrapher named Rakuan lived in Tamachi (present-day Minato-chō) and was also quite skilled, but he was so impressed by Sankan's calligraphy that he wrote his appreciation in a book called "Essential Theories of Famous Calligraphers Through the Ages" and presented it to him. Fortunately this also remains in my family. However, Sankan died of illness in the 8th month of Bunsei 3 at only seventeen years old, but many of his works are still preserved in my family.

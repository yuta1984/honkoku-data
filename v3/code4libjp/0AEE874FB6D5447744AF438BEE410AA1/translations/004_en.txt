The principals and staff of various municipal schools, including the principal of Tatehachicho Higher Elementary School, provided extraordinary assistance using their spare time from regular duties.

Moreover, the owners of historical materials responded with surprising enthusiasm to requests for their provision, and quite a few even proactively offered their materials. Under such circumstances, we received countless acts of kindness from various shrines, temples, and individuals. Among these, the Okochi Viscount family, Dr. Mikami of Literature, Bachelor of Literature Watanabe Seisuke, and others not only permitted the viewing and copying of precious materials but also provided considerable instruction.

Through such circumstances, the Toyohashi City History gradually began to take shape. While this Toyohashi Historical Discussion was indeed completed by my hand, it was in fact entirely accomplished through the power of Toyohashi City and the beneficence of these supporters. If this work has any benefit to society, the credit must be attributed to these corporate bodies and individuals.

Of course, as stated at the beginning, this historical discussion was published as a draft while materials were still being investigated and researched, seeking guidance from all quarters. Moreover, having been published intermittently over more than four years, it truly lacks coherence as a publication. This point must be attributed to my own literary inadequacy and ignorance, which is indeed embarrassing.

However, I am confident that the effort to publish all available materials without regard to page count or deadlines, exhaustively detailing everything, was an endeavor that could hardly be repeated.

In essence, the successful collection of Toyohashi City historical materials was, in a sense, the crystallization of the combined efforts of Toyohashi City and those who sympathized with it. And this historical discussion, though crude in external form, is undoubtedly a byproduct emerging from that crystallization. My joy in seeing this company publish it widely for permanent preservation, despite my own literary inadequacy and ignorance, stems precisely from this consideration.

Finally, I cannot cease to be grateful to the Sanyo Shinpo Company for successfully battling many difficulties over the years to complete this historical discussion and for further proceeding to publish it as a booklet.

Addendum
This book contains some printing errors and omissions, but unfortunately there is no time to correct them all individually. However, there are also two or three errors in the original manuscript. Notable examples include confusing the names of Manabe Akifusa and Akikatsu, and stating that Kichijoin was the family temple of the Tahara Isshiki clan when it was actually that of the Ushikubo Isshiki clan. These will be corrected in detail at a later date.

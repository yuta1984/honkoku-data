and thus should directly handle all governmental affairs and serve as a bulwark for the Imperial House. Furthermore, Sadanobu's lifelong frail health does not permit him to continue serving in such demanding duties. For this reason, he had repeatedly submitted requests for resignation, but each time received gracious commands to remain, and only after four private petitions was he finally allowed to resign from office." This seems to truly reflect Sadanobu's inner feelings.

Sadanobu was particularly, as I have mentioned before, a person deeply committed to imperial loyalty, and this sentiment can be glimpsed in various matters. However, since the Tokugawa already held supreme power over the realm, though it was presumptuous, there were times when the court had to be restrained. Without this, the Tokugawa rule could not be maintained, and this must have deeply pained Sadanobu's heart, particularly regarding the recent Imperial Title Incident, which I believe deepened his anguish.

In the "Records of Lord Sugaku's Words and Deeds," it states that on the night before Sadanobu's retirement, a large sealed confidential letter came from Ōta Bitchū-no-kami Sukenari to Nobuaki. However, this letter had accidentally been dropped in water by Bitchū-no-kami and was wet, but since it was urgent business, it was delivered as is. This letter seemed to concern some matter reported from Kyoto. The next day, Sadanobu retired from office. This Ōta Bitchū-no-kami had served as Kyoto deputy until the 8th month of Kansei 4 and joined the senior council from the 3rd month of year 5.

**Nobuaki's Resignation as Senior Councilor**

After Sadanobu's retirement, Nobuaki administered national affairs together with his colleagues Toda Une-no-shō Ujinori, Ōta Bitchū-no-kami Sukenari, Andō Tsushima-no-kami Nobunari, and Honda Danjō-no-daisuke Tadakazu. Ten years later, on the 22nd day of the 12th month of Kyōwa 3, Nobuaki also came to resign from his position.

Though Nobuaki's resignation was ostensibly due to illness, this is highly questionable. The "Sugaku Records" describes the circumstances: "On the 24th of the 11th month, the adoptive mother of Ōkubo Yamashiro-no-kami Tadayoshi died. Since this person was the aunt of Nobuaki's legitimate mother, he went into mourning. When the mourning period ended on the 28th, he should have resumed court attendance the next day, but claiming illness, he not only failed to attend but in early 12th month summoned his senior retainers and said: 'My recent absence from court is because I have opposed the shogun's wishes. However, I have my reasons, so do not worry.' On the 22nd, his colleague Makino Bizen-no-kami Tadakiyo sent word by letter that he should submit his resignation, so on the 19th, Nobuaki submitted his retirement petition due to illness to the monthly duty officer Toda Une-no-shō Ujinori."

Indeed, Nobuaki was, as I have repeatedly mentioned, extremely talented and of a temperament that did not hesitate to speak frankly, with a strong determination to achieve real reform of corrupt government during the Kansei era, which ultimately led to his opposing the shogun's wishes.

**Nobuaki's Extreme Remonstrance**

This incident occurred when Nobuaki was still a chamberlain, around age 26. Once, Shogun Ienari had his attendants build an artificial hill in a small room's garden, complete with miniature ponds, and proudly showed this to Nobuaki. Rather than praising it as expected, Nobuaki immediately straightened his posture and said: "One who governs the realm should consider all mountains, peaks, and seas within the nation as his garden. You should have the mindset to regard the cherry blossoms and autumn leaves of Yoshino and Tatsuta as flowers in your garden. To take pleasure in such trivial matters is truly narrow-minded. For the attendants to spend precious time on such worthless activities is hardly beneficial to you." At this, the attendants broke into nervous sweats, and Shogun Ienari also seemed displeased. However, he eventually accepted this counsel.

Given such incidents, the shogun occasionally found Nobuaki's remarks disagreeable and may have been dissatisfied with his behavior. However, there is another important matter that requires investigation here. This Shogun Ienari was, as previously mentioned, originally the son of Hitotsubashi Harunari who was adopted to succeed the former shogun Ieharu, and he had long wished to honor his biological father Harunari as Ōgosho (retired shogun) and welcome him to the Western Citadel. During Sadanobu's tenure, both Nobuaki and he...

...died in Ka'ei 3, first month, at age 64.

Next is the story of Suzuki Sangaku. Sangaku was from Yoshida Shinsen-chō, his common name was Yohei, and he had pen names including Suinoya and Saishōnen. He was a disciple of the aforementioned Shirō and was skilled in haikai poetry. He also had close relations with Watanabe Kazan and studied painting under him. While Kazan was confined to Tahara, Sangaku exclusively supported his household finances. Since Kazan was under house arrest at the time, he refrained from openly painting for others, but mostly worked through Sangaku's hands, deliberately using era names from before his confinement to fulfill commissions from others. Therefore, Sangaku's house contained over fifty masterpieces by Kazan, including paintings and folding screens of various sizes. The famous "Thousand Mountains and Ten Thousand Waters" painting was among them, but after Sangaku's death they gradually scattered in all directions, and today very few of those paintings remain in our Toyohashi city. Sangaku died of illness on September 4, Ka'ei 7, at age 60.

Around that time, at the main family house related to this Sangaku, in present-day Hanazono-chō, there was a man named Suzuki Kichibei. This person died on October 12, Meiji 4, at age 64, and was the predecessor of the current Suzuki Kichibei, who goes by the pen name Baigan. This person also had relations with Kazan during his youth. His grandfather was named Hōrin, who possessed a unique and interesting perspective. His handwritten family constitution still remains in the house, and Kazan's additions to it are quite interesting. Although the writer is listed as Kichibei, in reality it was ghostwritten by Kazan. It clearly records the history of the family constitution, as well as the achievements of grandfather Hōrin and father Jizen, and through the biographies of these people, one can also understand the circumstances of Kazan during his confinement, making it a work of great interest.

Next, I would like to discuss one more person - Shibata Inosuke. This person was a Yoshida retainer and the predecessor of the current Shibata Hōsui. He died of illness in Ka'ei 2, fourth month, at age 66. Among his writings was something called "Rice Price Record," which continuously collected rice price statistics over a long period from the distant past of Genki 3 up to the year before his death, Ka'ei 1.

His perseverance and meticulousness are truly amazing, and I believe this work serves as an invaluable reference for today's economic studies as well. After the Meiji Restoration, this book was borrowed by the Ministry of Finance, which returned it with a formal letter of thanks, so the original is still preserved in the Shibata family.

Now, regarding the population of Yoshida during Nobuaki's era, according to the religious registry records of the time, in Kōka 2 the total population of men and women combined was 5,535 people, representing a decrease of ten people from the previous year. According to the records from Ka'ei 1, the total population was 5,519 people, an increase of ten people from the previous year. It's unclear whether these figures include retainers, as I haven't thoroughly investigated this, but in any case, the population showed little change from year to year and was actually somewhat declining. There were various causes for this, but as I mentioned briefly much earlier, townspeople suffered greatly from duties such as post-horse services, so unlike today where farmers abandon agriculture to concentrate in cities, such phenomena were completely absent. Also in Kōka 2, repairs were made to Yoshida's great bridge, and I would like to mention in passing that records by a man named Ōmura Kumezō from Funa-machi regarding this matter are still preserved in a warehouse in Funa-machi.

◉Correction: In this chapter regarding Nakai Rakusho, where it says "strict father of Imura Gensai," it should be corrected to "grandfather of Murai Gensai."

◉Matsudaira Nobuhisa's Succession

As stated in the previous chapter, Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobuaki died of illness on July 27, Ka'ei 2, at the age of 23 (the previous chapter's statement of age 21 was an error), and he had no heir. Therefore, Nobuhisa, the second son of Manabe Norikatu...

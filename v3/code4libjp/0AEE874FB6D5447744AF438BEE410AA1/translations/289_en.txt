Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Yoshida Domain During Its Residence in Osaka and Yamamoto Hayao) 550

**Main Text:**
　　　　　　Regarding the matter of expelling foreigners, as indicated in the attached document, on the 7th, the court transmitters informed those stationed in Kyoto. Concerning this matter, if foreigners should arrive in the Lord of Kii's territory, should we dispense with diplomatic reception and drive them away without hesitation? I have been instructed to consult with you on this matter.

　　　　　　Attached document:
　　　　　　Regarding the deadline for expelling foreigners, since a proclamation was issued throughout the realm, it goes without saying that all domains should be prepared to repel foreign ships. However, it has come to our attention that some domains are standing by as mere observers, which deeply troubles His Majesty's heart. Since fighting has already begun in Chōshū, this concerns the unity of the imperial nation. Therefore, domains should mutually support each other in expulsion efforts, and all domains should unite in decisive battle and strive to ensure that our imperial nation suffers no disgrace, thus carrying out His Majesty's will. This is the imperial command.

　　　　　　In other words, this attached document was a direct imperial command to each domain, and the Lord of Kii was uncertain whether he should implement it exactly as stated, so he inquired with the Osaka castle deputy about the shogunate's true intentions. Consequently, Nobuhisa requested guidance from the senior councilors, attaching a copy of the aforementioned document. The senior councilors' directive, which could be called their instruction slip, is also quite interesting. It stated:

　　　　　　Regarding expulsion, since negotiations are still underway at Yokohama and it is difficult to determine acceptance or rejection, attacks from our side should be suspended. Should relations finally break down, further instructions may be forthcoming. Unless they attack first, rash actions should be avoided. While the expulsion order means that vigilance in guard duties cannot be relaxed for a moment, nonetheless, the meaningless attacking of foreign ships engaged in regular trade should be avoided. This should be conveyed accordingly.

　　　　　　Although the senior councilors gave such guidance, this still left domains uncertain about which authority to follow, and they must have been troubled about how to proceed. At that time, British ships happened to be visible off Mount Mejirushi, so on June 14th, the Osaka castle deputy issued a proclamation to the domains along the Kansai coast in accordance with that instruction slip. Then on the 20th of that month, messengers from both Lords Nomiya and Bōjō came to the Osaka castle deputy with the following imperial message:

　　　　　　Regarding the expulsion deadline, a proclamation was previously issued. Since Chōshū has already faithfully obeyed His Majesty's will and resolutely carried out expulsion, hereafter when foreigners arrive, they should be driven away without hesitation.

　　　　　　Of course, the domains responsible for coastal defense should mutually assist each other and strive in their defensive efforts. This is the imperial command.

　　　　　　Consequently, the Osaka castle deputy had no choice but to issue the following notification to all domains on the 22nd of that month:

　　　　　　As per the attached document:
　　　　　　Since this has been commanded by the imperial court, the document issued by Izu-no-kami on the 14th should be rescinded. End.

　　　　　　Looking back from today, this may seem quite absurd, but at that time, as the Osaka castle deputy responsible for commanding the Kansai lords, it must have been truly trying. Of course, this is just one example, but in any case, while the imperial court directly issued constant commands regarding expulsion, the shogunate ordered that foreign ships should be dealt with through moderate means and rash violent actions should be avoided. The lack of unified government policy was indeed severe.

　　　　　　There is one more matter I would like to discuss here regarding the aforementioned sighting of British ships off Mount Mejirushi. Matsudaira Sagami-no-kami, who was responsible for coastal defense, sent the following message to Nobuhisa as Osaka castle deputy. Let me first present the complete text:

　　　　　　I write to you directly. In this hot season, I trust above all that you continue in good health, which I find most gratifying. Regarding the British ship that appeared off Mount Mejirushi on the 14th, I reported that my retainers on guard duty would quickly deploy to drive it away. However, I received word from you instructing the guard retainers to refrain from such action in the future, which I acknowledge. While I will follow your guidance in ordinary local matters, regarding guard duties, I recently received imperial instructions on the general's duties, and this concerns matters before the transfer of authority. Moreover, this spring while Lord Hitotsubashi was in Kyoto, when I inquired about driving away foreign ships without hesitation should any appear, the matter was also communicated to Lord Shungaku, who gave guidance that driving them away as inquired would be acceptable. Furthermore, since I have repeatedly received imperial commands in this matter,

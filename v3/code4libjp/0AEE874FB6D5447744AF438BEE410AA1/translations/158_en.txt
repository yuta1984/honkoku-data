...should not focus solely on such matters and cause the peasants to fall into poverty. However, light taxation is what peasants prefer, and there are cases where they cleverly devise various schemes to deceive officials, or use bribes to hide their true circumstances from lower officials. This must be thoroughly reformed. If such cases exist, not only the relevant officials and lower officials but also the individuals themselves, and all prominent peasants in various locations must be punished without exception. Both officials and peasants must strictly observe this directive.

Note: Tax collection shall be limited to the twelfth month. Regarding rice storage and other matters, lower officials must be firmly instructed to avoid any personal misconduct. Moreover, even when the warrior household sends tax assessment notices to officials, if there are delays due to personal relationships with individuals, this causes great harm to the warrior household. Officials must ensure there are no delays. Those who send such notices must also conduct proper investigations based on legitimate reasons before sending them.

1. Expenses for gold, silver, rice, grain, silk, cloth, utensils, fish, birds, vegetables, and all other miscellaneous uses must be reduced to avoid any waste. However, since practicing frugality serves the public good, care must be taken that official business does not appear inadequately supported, and gifts to traveling dignitaries should be appropriate considering the recipients' status. Financial officials must not be negligent in these deliberations.

The above articles, as well as previously established regulations, must be firmly observed without fail.

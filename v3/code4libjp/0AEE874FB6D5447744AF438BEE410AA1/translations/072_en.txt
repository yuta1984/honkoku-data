da Nobuyoshi and others to the vicinity of Kurose near Hōrai-ji Temple, but they ultimately could not arrive in time. Now, at that time at Tsukude Castle there was a Takeda general named Amari Saemon Kiyoyoshi, and later Tsuchiya Uemon Naomura, who had been stationed at Kurose, also moved there. The aforementioned Okudaira father and son, one of the three Yamaga strongholds I mentioned before, were in the outer bailey. Okudaira Sadayoshi's son Kyūhachirō Sadamasa, who later changed his name to Nobumasa, had learned of Shingen's death beforehand and frequently urged his father Sadayoshi to surrender and return to the Tokugawa. Ieyasu also had Honda Hirotaka and likewise Nobutoshi make recommendations, so Sadayoshi finally resolved on this course. However, the Takeda side found Sadayoshi's behavior suspicious around this time, so Nobutoy, who was encamped at Kurose, summoned and interrogated him. At this time, however, Sadayoshi remained completely composed, not only answering that he harbored no treacherous intentions, but leisurely playing go and enjoying tea over rice, remaining perfectly calm. Moreover, when Sadayoshi's retainers were crouching outside the gate waiting for their master to emerge, someone threatened them saying "Your master's rebellion has now been exposed and he has been executed," but the retainers showed no alarm whatsoever - they remained completely unperturbed and even smiled. This was the result of Sadayoshi's usual instruction to his retainers: "No matter what the Takeda people may say to you, do not be alarmed until you actually see my severed head," with which he had deeply cautioned them. This incident is also recorded in works like the "Butoku Hennen Shūsei." Because of this behavior, the Takeda side remained half-believing and half-doubting when they let Sadayoshi return, but as soon as Sadayoshi returned to Tsukude, saying there was no time to delay, he immediately fled with his entire clan and retainers to Takiyama fortress. Ieyasu sent troops to welcome them. The Takeda side pursued them and there was a small battle, but they were completely repelled, so in anger they crucified Sadayoshi's hostage son Senchiyo and others at Hōrai-ji Temple. For these reasons, not only Sadayoshi but also Nobumasa came to be increasingly valued by Ieyasu. Particularly Nobumasa, though young, was seen as having great promise, so in the second month of Tenshō 3, two years later, when the reconstruction of Nagashino Castle was completed, he was appointed as its garrison commander to make this castle

serve as a key strategic point against invasions by Kai-Shinano armies.

Now, after Nagashino Castle fell into Ieyasu's hands, there were frequent clashes between the Tokugawa and Takeda clans in the Tōtōmi region. In the fifth month of Tenshō 2, Katsuyori led 30,000 troops to besiege Takatenjin Castle. When Ieyasu heard of this emergency, he sought aid from Nobunaga, who led troops himself to help. His vanguard reached the Imagiri ferry by the eighteenth day of the sixth month, but Takatenjin's garrison commander Ogasawara Nagatada had already surrendered to Katsuyori before then, so Nobunaga withdrew midway. At this time Ieyasu went out to meet him, and Sakai Saemon-no-jō Tadatsugu entertained Nobunaga at this Yoshida Castle. Nobunaga in turn presented a bag of gold to Ieyasu and granted a Sadamune sword to Sakai Tadatsugu in the castle's main hall. This is also recorded in the "Matsudaira-ki" and "Butoku Hennen Shūsei."

However, at that time in the capital region, as I mentioned before, relations between Nobunaga and Shogun Yoshiaki had become increasingly hostile and quite critical. Yoshiaki repeatedly sent letters to Katsuyori urging him to "come to the capital as soon as possible to assist me." Therefore Katsuyori's desire to continue his father's ambitions and plant his banner in the capital certainly grew ever stronger. Regarding the situation at that time, Narishima Shichoku had already argued as follows in his annotations to the "Tokugawa Jikki":

"Considering the situation of the realm at that time, Lord Oda supported Shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, forced the surrender of Miyoshi and Matsunaga, destroyed Sasaki Rokkaku, and accomplished the restoration of the Ashikaga house. However, his arrogant and willful behavior knew no bounds and his tyrannical conduct was excessive, so Yoshiaki grew weary and troubled by this. Outwardly he employed Lord Oda, but in reality he sought to overthrow him and secretly sent confidential orders to Asakura of Echizen, Asai of Ōmi, and Takeda of Kai. This is why the Battle of Anegawa occurred. Clear proof of this can be seen in documents preserved at Renge-jōin of Mount Kōya and Shōkō-in of Mount Yoshino. Furthermore, afterward the Takeda of Kai, Uesugi of Echigo, and Hōjō of Sagami were the most prominent among those controlling territories in Kantō and the northern provinces"

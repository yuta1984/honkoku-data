Now, these five letters not only reveal the close friendship between Sadanobu and Nobuaki during their youth, but are extremely valuable because they show the actual conditions of that time. As I mentioned before, Tanuma Okitsugu, who had monopolized power, passed through the An'ei years and into the Tenmei era, when on March 24th of Tenmei 4 (1784) his son Tanuma Yamashiro-no-kami Okitomo was attacked by Sano Zenzaemon Masakoto in the castle, marking the beginning of his downfall. On August 27th of Tenmei 6 (1786), he was finally dismissed from office. At that time, Shogun Ieharu was seriously ill and officially died on September 8th of that year, but it is believed that he actually died on August 20th of that year. The three branch families and senior councilors strictly kept the death secret, first dismissing Tanuma under the pretext of the shogun's orders, and only then gradually announced the death. When Ieharu's illness became critical, his close retainers firmly refused to allow Okitsugu to attend the sick shogun, and if Okitsugu had insisted on attending the shogun's sickbed, they plotted to kill him rather than allow it. Okitsugu, frightened by this, dared not enter the inner chambers, and during this time received orders for dismissal under the name of imperial command.

When Ieharu's death was announced, Ienari immediately moved to the main castle and succeeded him. Ieharu's funeral was held at Tōeizan in Ueno on October 4th, and on the 5th of intercalary October, 20,000 koku were confiscated from Tanuma Okitsugu's domain, along with the Osaka warehouse and the upper residence at Kandabashi in Edo. Moreover, this was during the consecutive bad harvests known as the Tenmei Famine, particularly the severe crop failures of years 4 and 5 (dragon and snake years), and with this turmoil occurring at the height of the crisis, the people of the capital were in a state of great anxiety. The letters that Sadanobu sent to Nobuaki that I mentioned earlier show the conditions of this time - all five letters date from September through intercalary October of Tenmei 6. The first is dated September 9th, the next has no date but from the facts must certainly be from mid-month, then October 18th...

...intercalary October 18th, and the 21st of the same month. In the September 9th letter, regarding Shogun Ieharu's death, he writes: "One who thinks of our great lord's benevolence has tears with nowhere to fall, and I am terrified day and night. Even though today is a festival day, it is truly heartbreaking and frightening - the thousands of years we prayed for have come to naught, and tears mix with the chrysanthemum wine cup." At that time Sadanobu was supposed to depart to inspect his domain of Shirakawa and had even obtained shogunal permission, but had delayed departure a day or two for personal reasons when he heard of the shogun's death and finally postponed his departure. From the content, it appears that even Sadanobu knew nothing of Ieharu's death until it was announced on September 8th. If the shogun's death was indeed around August 20th as I mentioned earlier, it must have been kept extremely secret. This letter also describes the consecutive crop failures in the Ōshū region, and particularly celebrates that Tanuma's retirement would end the practice of rampant bribery, using a humorous tone: "People say the powerful gates will cease their practices. This is most excellent and gratifying. If it truly ceases, I as a money-grubbing fellow would be especially delighted and could accumulate wealth. It would be quite beneficial for the various daimyo as well." From this we can see not only the conditions of the time but how extremely intimate the friendship between Sadanobu and Nobuaki was, and how they confided in each other.

The October 18th letter was sent after Sadanobu had already arrived at his domain of Shirakawa in Ōshū, and it contains: "I hear rumors have been boiling in the capital recently - what a deplorable situation. You must surely be distressed by this. I hear repeated rumors about members of the three branch families remaining behind. Your meetings and such are matters of great importance..." This refers to the confiscation of 20,000 koku from Tanuma Okitsugu and the Osaka warehouse and Kandabashi...

Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Matsudaira Nobuyori's Succession) 380

...leading to ruin, which knowledgeable people deeply regretted. Such was the general situation after Nobuaki's death.

**Nobuyori as Osaka Castle Keeper:**
From the early years of Tenpō, the country suffered from poor harvests, rice prices gradually rose, and by the fourth year, uprisings of impoverished people were seen in various places. Consequently, the situation in Osaka city became truly unstable, but of course at that time Nobuyori was there as castle keeper.

In July of that year, the aforementioned Yabe Suruga-no-kami transferred from Sakai magistrate to become Osaka town magistrate, and Nobuyori held daily secret consultations with Sunshū, strictly controlling rice merchants who greedily sought improper profits. According to a record called "Jūsei Iji-shō" in the Ōkōchi family, at that time Sunshū would daily hide his face with a deep hat and secretly patrol the city, observing rice price tags and recording any rice merchants attempting to sell at even slightly high prices, reporting to Nobuyori each time to enforce these controls, for which his benevolence was praised by later generations.

On April 11 of the following fifth year, Nobuyori was promoted to Kyoto deputy (shoshidai), and in the following sixth year, Sunshū was also transferred elsewhere. However, when Ōshio Heihachirō's rebellion occurred in February of the eighth year, the people of Osaka increasingly longed for Nobuyori's virtue, as recorded.

**Nobuyori as Kyoto Deputy:**
Thus Nobuyori transferred from Osaka castle keeper to Kyoto deputy in April of Tenpō 5. When he first ascended to the imperial palace, he composed this poem:

*What seemed so distant, the realm above the clouds*
*Today I climb to gaze upon the high sun's light*

This was probably composed at that time.

Nobuyori served as Kyoto deputy until May of the eighth year, when on the 16th of that month he was promoted from deputy to senior councilor. During his tenure in Kyoto, as I mentioned before, rice prices continued to soar and Ōshio's rebellion occurred in Osaka, so Kyoto was also quite turbulent. However, Nobuyori, with shogunal permission, had the upper town magistrate establish relief huts to provide rice gruel to the poor and medical treatment to the sick. Of course, he also endeavored to correct unscrupulous merchants who sought to profit by inflating rice prices. Here I would like to share an interesting anecdote.

**The Grain Merchant's Deception:**
At that time, there was a grain shop on Senbon Street in Kyoto that, despite the circumstances, gained great reputation for measuring grain portions particularly generously. When Nobuaki heard of this, he said, "While this seems like truly admirable behavior, it is quite suspicious during this time of soaring rice prices. Either investigate whether this person has consistently shown such good character." When they investigated the person's conduct, they found no evidence of such virtuous intentions.

Therefore, Nobuyori became increasingly suspicious and had the measuring containers examined. They discovered that rice bran had been kneaded and attached to the bottom of the old measures to make them shallower. Thus, even while appearing to measure generously, one shō was still one shō due to this mechanism. The officials were surprised, but since it wasn't a case of selling nine gō as one shō, they ordered the cessation of business and house arrest.

**Administrative Achievements:**
In this way, Nobuyori immediately upon transfer planned extraordinary protection for the impoverished, gradually restoring public peace, with all citizens revering his benevolence.

Also, when Nobuyori appeared at the imperial palace during his Kyoto tenure, the grounds were inadequately cleaned with overgrown weeds. After returning to his residence, he summoned officials saying: "How do you justify leaving the imperial grounds uncleaned with grass growing freely? This is the most respectfully regarded residence of the heavenly sovereign—such disrespectful conduct is inexcusable!" He strictly warned them about future conduct.

According to a story attributed to a public official named Okamoto recorded in the Jūsei Iji-shō, from Nobuyori's arrival in Kyoto, he constantly posed various questions to officials, which were always unexpected and difficult for anyone to answer. Since this would become too lengthy, I won't relate all these anecdotes here, but through such methods Nobuyori earnestly sought good governance, earning the genuine respect and submission of the people to his moral authority.

Incidentally, I would like to briefly mention here the travel record when Nobuyori was appointed Osaka castle keeper and departed for his post, along with...

Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Anecdotes of Matsudaira Nobuaki) 352

**Main Text:**

A messenger came saying there was an urgent summons. Sato, believing the situation had become even more troublesome, fearfully resolved himself and appeared before his lord. However, Nobuaki's mood was completely transformed from earlier - he called Sato close to his side and said, "Your earlier remonstrance touched me deeply and I am grateful for it. Henceforth I will abstain from alcohol as you advised. As a token of this, I will give you all the sake cups I have used until now." He bestowed all of them upon Sato. Upon hearing this, Sato was overcome with joy and wept tears of gratitude. The cups bestowed at that time are said to still be preserved in the Sato family home today. This direct account from Sato is also recorded in the Sugaku-kun Genkoroku (Record of Lord Sugaku's Words and Deeds). Throughout history, rulers known as wise lords always have stories of accepting remonstrance, and this tale of Nobuaki should also be passed down as a truly beautiful story.

**Nobuaki's Energy**
I would like to speak here about how Nobuaki was truly a person of tremendous energy. As I mentioned briefly before, Nobuaki was already skilled in calligraphy from his youth, and a copy he made of Kosawa's Thousand Characters at age twenty is still preserved in the Okochi family today. Looking at the postscript, it reads:

"(omitted)...wished to copy it as a model, but during the day was busy with public and private affairs, so copied it by lamplight, completing it in two nights. Even if called an obsession with writing, I do not refuse it."

The energy to complete such work in just two nights is truly remarkable. He was also skilled in seal carving, and dozens of his self-carved stone seals, wooden seals, and plaques still remain with the Okochi family today. All are magnificently done, many at a level that even professional artisans could not match. He also composed poetry and waka, leaving behind poetry collections as well. Whatever he undertook showed considerable achievement, indicating that he devoted extraordinary energy to everything he did. Particularly considering that he was busy day and night with governmental affairs and dealing with national matters, while displaying his genius in his official duties as I have described previously, his energy was truly remarkable.

**Nobuaki's Frugality**
It goes without saying that Nobuaki always made frugality and economy his principle. He would say there was no need to specially make hakama trousers - one could simply use the lower portion of a kamishimo formal outfit. Accordingly, all his remaining possessions show no decorative touches whatsoever. Even in seal carving, which was his lifelong passion, he carved only on plain soapstone, never adding any ornamentation. However, he was never miserly. When expenses were necessary, he would spend without hesitation. As you know, when Nobuaki rose to prominence, it was after the so-called Tanuma era, so he strove to break that corrupt influence and revive the samurai spirit. He encouraged horsemanship and organized hawking expeditions to reinvigorate the people who had grown weak and complacent. Thus, despite his domain being only 70,000 koku, he personally maintained thirty to forty horses and twenty to thirty hawks. Being a person of such character, he was naturally of extremely honest disposition, and there is another beautiful story worth telling about this.

**Nobuaki's Integrity**
This is a story from when Nobuaki was senior councilor. There was a hatamoto (direct retainer of the shogun) named Yonezu Kotaifu who held the territory of Ushikubo in Hoi District. His domain was not only sandwiched between Nobuaki's territory (the Yoshida domain) but was also extremely fertile. This caused great inconvenience for the Yoshida domain in all matters, and given its fertility, the domain's senior retainer proposed to Nobuaki that they should arrange a land exchange to move Yonezu elsewhere and incorporate Ushikubo into the Yoshida domain. However, Nobuaki refused to consider this, saying: "That would be selfish. Originally, small stipend holdings extend beyond their nominal boundaries, so their actual yield exceeds what appears on paper. To force him to exchange his comparatively compact territory for our land would be truly heartless. Such an action is unnecessary - abandon the idea." Even the domain's senior retainer was impressed by Nobuaki's benevolence and integrity. This too is an interesting story for understanding Nobuaki's character.

**Shijian Hokumei**
Now, regarding what I mentioned in the previous chapter about the ikebana master Hokurai's disciple named Hokumei - this is well known among those in that field. This person was also the head priest of Kannon-ji temple and was Hokurai's dharma grandson. He later inherited the name Shijian and received the seal of approval as head of the association in the 12th month of Bunsei 5. However, I regret that I cannot learn much more about this person's achievements.

**The Filial Son Hatsuzō**
Here I would like to tell one more story - about a filial son named Hatsuzō from Uomachi during that time. He was the ancestor of Mr. Hayakawa Hikoshichi, who still lives in Uomachi today. His father was named Hikosuke. Hatsuzō was gentle by nature and extremely devoted to his parents, but since his family had always been poor, he worked day and night to serve his father and mother. He particularly loved reading and never tired of it, continuing until late into the night. Of course he practiced extreme frugality, and whenever he had even the smallest surplus, he would save it. Once when he wanted to buy a book but had difficulty obtaining the funds, he went all the way to Nagoya carrying other people's goods for a small wage, used that money to buy the book he wanted, and carried it home. His filial devotion and daily conduct gradually became known to people, and eventually reached the ears of domain lord Nobuyori, who rewarded him with seven bags of rice in Bunsei 2. A work called "Ōrenshū" that this Hatsuzō copied himself still remains in his descendants' house. The details of his life are also recorded in a book called "Biographies of Filial Sons of Our Domain," which I hope you will consult.

Besides these, there are various other records from Nobuyori's time in the Ōkōchi family storehouse and in warehouses in Funamachi. I have not yet been able to investigate all of these one by one, but I plan to gradually examine them and publish whatever is necessary by the time of the city history compilation. Therefore, if anyone has knowledge of such matters, I would appreciate it if you would not hesitate to share your teachings on any subject.

**Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobutaka**

As I mentioned in the previous chapter, Matsudaira Nobuyori retired on the 13th day of the 12th month of Tenpō 13, and his son Nobutaka was ordered to inherit the family headship on the same day. He was subsequently appointed Izu-no-kami and inherited his father's domain. His mother was the townwoman of the Kaneko family mentioned in the previous chapter, later known as Reishōin. Nobutaka was born on the 10th day of the 9th month of Bunsei 9 and was initially called Chōnosuke, though before being appointed Izu-no-kami he was known as Hayato-no-shō. Now, at the time of Nobutaka's succession, foreign policy issues were becoming quite pressing, and in the intercalary 9th month of the following year, Tenpō 14, Mizuno Echizen-no-kami Tadakuni's great reforms ended in failure and he resigned from his position as rōjū. Afterward, Doi Toshitsura became senior rōjū and took over, but he immediately came into conflict with Mito Nariakira. I have already outlined the main points of these matters in the previous chapter, but Tenpō was changed to Kōka in its 15th year.

**Nobutaka's Death**
On the 2nd day of the 3rd month of Tenpō 15, the retired Nobuyori died, and subsequently on the 17th day of the 10th month of that same year (announced on the 20th day of the 11th month), Nobutaka also died of illness. He died at only twenty-one years of age and was given the posthumous name Kanryōin. For this reason, Nobutaka's life was very short, so there are few matters to discuss here beyond what I have mentioned above. However, when Nobutaka entered Yoshida castle on the 12th day of the 6th month of Tenpō 14, the year after his succession, his written instructions to the elder retainers provide truly interesting material for understanding the internal situation of daimyo at that time. The directives issued by the inspectors regarding Jishūkan in the 6th month of the following year, Tenpō 15, as well as the circular from the inspectors in the 9th month of the same year, are extremely interesting for understanding the domain's educational affairs and the customs of the time, so I would like to include them below for reference.

Tenpō 14, year of the water rabbit, 6th month, 12th day, at Yoshida, Lord Nobutaka's personal written instructions delivered to the elders in the great reception hall:

**Nobutaka's Personal Written Instructions**
"Whereas the retainers have faced many difficulties with annual rice deductions, they have all continued to serve diligently, which is truly remarkable given their constant devotion. On this occasion of my succession..."

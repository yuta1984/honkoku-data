advanced to Nara, then established camp at Sumiyoshi. Hidetada proceeded through Hirakata and Hiraoka to Hirano, where he met with Ieyasu at Tennōji on the 18th and held a war council. However, this was where Ieyasu showed his true nature as Ieyasu - instead, he initiated peace negotiations with the Osaka side, which took place on the 20th. Nevertheless, on one hand they continued to devise siege strategies and strengthen their defenses, but finally on December 22nd a peace agreement was reached, bringing temporary resolution.

**Peace Agreement Reached** This was essentially what is known as the Winter Campaign of Osaka. As I mentioned earlier, Matsudaira Tadatoshi, lord of Yoshida Castle, participated in this campaign. On November 11th, following Ieyasu's orders, he worked with Ina Tadamasa {son of Tadatsugu} to plan the destruction of embankments near Torigai on the opposite shore to reduce the waters of the Yodo River, and during the siege defended Amagasaki Castle, as recorded in various documents.

**Tadatoshi's Military Achievements** In any case, the Winter Campaign of Osaka was temporarily settled as described above, but among the peace conditions was a clause requiring the destruction of part of the castle fortifications. This was supposed to be an agreement to fill in only the outer moats, but the Tokugawa side proceeded to fill in even the moats of the second bailey, so the Osaka side accused them of breaking the agreement. However, this was said to be the arbitrary decision of Honda Masazumi, and while the matter remained unclear, the construction work continued steadily and was finally completed.

**Osaka's Second Rising** Moreover, among the peace conditions was also the matter of supporting the masterless samurai in Osaka Castle. When this matter was later negotiated from Osaka to Kantō, Ieyasu became greatly enraged and dismissed the envoys, so feeling there was no other choice, Osaka finally decided to rise again.

**Summer Campaign** This became the Summer Campaign of Osaka. Since the Keichō era ended with the 19th year and the era name changed to Genna, this campaign took place in the first year of Genna. Initially, Ieyasu departed Sunpu on April 4th, ostensibly to conduct his son Yoshinao's wedding ceremony, stayed at Yoshida on the 8th, and reached Nagoya on the 10th. On the 15th he left Nagoya again and entered Nijō Castle on the 18th. Hidetada departed Edo on the 10th of that month, passed through Yoshida on the 18th, entered Fushimi Castle on the 21st, and then advanced on Osaka together with Ieyasu. This time, as you all well know, there were extremely fierce battles.

**Fall of the Toyotomi Clan** The result was ultimately the defeat of the Osaka side, and on May 8th of that year, beginning with Hideyori and his mother, they set fire to Osaka Castle and committed suicide, leading to the complete destruction of the Toyotomi clan.

**Shōkurō Tadakazu** In this campaign too, Matsudaira Tadatoshi participated and was attached to Tokugawa Yorinobu's forces. At this time, Tadatoshi had a younger brother named Shōkurō Tadakazu, who ultimately died in battle. Since his conduct was truly admirable, I will excerpt that passage from the records in "Hankanfu" below:

Tadatoshi's younger brother was called Shōkurō Tadakazu and served the Shogun's house. When the Osaka military disturbance arose again, he told his colleagues: "When this military campaign ends, there will be no more warfare in the realm. How fortunate that Tadakazu follows in the Shogun's vanguard. I will certainly charge ahead first and follow in the loyal death of my forefathers." In the battle of May 7th, true to his word, he charged foremost and died in battle at the age of 26.

This reference to "the loyal death of forefathers" refers to how Yoshikage, Koretada, and Ietada - three generations of this house - died consecutively for their lord, as I mentioned earlier. Tadakazu, who was Ietada's son, was clearly inspired and motivated by this. While I do not advocate merely making light of death, the fact that this family's history produced such a son and Tadakazu's spirit are truly instructive and deserve recognition.

In this manner, the Toyotomi clan finally perished and warfare gradually came to an end. In the following second year, on March 27th, Ieyasu was appointed Daijō-daijin (Chancellor of the Realm). However, on the 17th of the following month, he died of illness in Sunpu at the age of 75.

**Ieyasu's Death** Nine years later, on July 27th, Hidetada also resigned from the position of Seii Taishogun, and his son Iemitsu succeeded him as Shogun. {Iemitsu becomes Seii Taishogun} At this time, Hidetada went to the capital and had an imperial audience, departing Edo on May 12th and staying at Yoshida on the first day of June.

**Hidetada's Resignation** **Hidetada's Journey to the Capital** On this occasion too, the bakufu issued various ordinances to retainers and those in the capital, and the document addressed to the village headmen of both Goyu and Akasaka at this time is still preserved at the Hayashi residence I mentioned earlier. This is also extremely

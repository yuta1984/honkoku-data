...with Ōsuga Takayuki leading the right wing unit and Sakakibara Yasumasa leading the left wing unit, while Tadashige personally led the reserve unit. Niwa Ujitsugu, lord of Iwasaki Castle, who had been serving as guide from the beginning, continued to act as their guide.

The right wing unit and reserve unit proceeded via Inokoishibara and directly pressed upon the enemy's rear guard - the fourth unit - at Hakusanrin. The left wing unit went through the Seto highway, emerged at Inaba, circled around and struck the left side of the enemy formation. This battle began at dawn on the ninth day. The enemy's fourth unit was caught completely off guard and found themselves in a pincer attack, so they fled in complete disarray. Unit commander Hidetsugu crossed the Kanare River and took position at a place called Saigane near Nagakute, but the eastern army's pursuit was so fierce that he barely escaped with his life.

Here, with what might be called "riding the tiger's momentum," the eastern army detachment pressed forward relentlessly, and though Tadashige tried to restrain them, his orders could not be carried out effectively. Meanwhile, the third unit of the western army - that is, Katsuiri's detachment - was resting at Kanehagibara when they heard gunfire from the direction of the rear guard. Puzzled, they sent out scouts and discovered it was an attack by the eastern army. Moreover, they received successive urgent reports from the fourth unit, so unit commander Hori Hidemasa immediately turned his forces around, reached Nagakute, occupied the high ground called Hinokigane, deployed his troops there, and took position with the Kanare River in front.

Just then, the eastern army detachment converged and attacked this position. The western army's Hori unit fired down upon them from the high ground, so this time it was the eastern army that suffered a major defeat. Their reserve and right wing units retreated toward Inokoshi, while the left wing unit retreated toward Iwasa. Hidemasa accordingly divided his forces to pursue them, but at that moment Ieyasu and Nobuo appeared together leading the main eastern army force. They had followed the Seto highway, circled around the western army's right flank (originally their left flank), and emerged at a place called Fujigane behind Hinokigane. Hidemasa was shocked and eventually fled back to the main camp at Gakuden via Inaba. 

In the end, the first and second units of the western army were left behind. Both had turned back upon hearing the rear guard alarm, but found their retreat route already cut off by Ieyasu. They were forced to give battle at Nagakute.

The result, as you all know, was that the main commanders - Ikeda Katsuiri along with his son Yukisuke, and Mori Nagayoshi - were all killed in action. Only Yukisuke's younger brother Terumasa escaped...

...but at this time Ieyasu halted the pursuit at the Yada River, ended the battle by 1 PM, and had already entered Obata Castle by around 4 PM.

Now for Hideyoshi. He remained at his camp in Gakuden and had attacks made on the Komaki fortifications on the sixth and ninth days to facilitate Nobuteru and others' movements, but achieved little success. However, around noon on the ninth day, news of the defeat at Hakusanrin first arrived. Greatly shocked, he quickly decided on a relief strategy and around 1 PM personally departed leading about 20,000 troops. En route he received reports about the attack on Iwasaki Castle, which made him even more anxious about the situation ahead, so he pressed forward rapidly.

At this time, the Tokugawa forces remaining at Komaki learned of this through intelligence, so they held a council of war. Sakai Tadatsugu argued that if they seized this opportunity to strike the enemy fortifications in front of them, the enemy would surely be defeated. Honda Tadakatsu agreed, but Ishikawa Kazumasa alone disagreed. Tadatsugu was extremely disappointed, but feeling they could not simply abandon the situation, Honda Tadakatsu together with Ishikawa Yasumichi led a mere 500 troops to tail Hideyoshi's large army, eventually marching parallel to his main force and firing upon them as they went. This became famous as one of Tadakatsu's outstanding achievements, though there are various accounts of these events. However, I have relied on the "Mikawa Monogatari," which records it as follows:

"Then those remaining at Komaki, Sakai Saemon-no-jō spoke thus: 'Since the Kampaku has pressed forward, I am concerned about the Obata route. If we were to break through the double moats from here and set fire to all their camps and burn them down, even the Kampaku would suffer defeat.' Though he urged this course, from that time Ishikawa Hōki-no-kami had sympathies toward the Kampaku, so he said such action would not be appropriate. Since Hōki-no-kami absolutely refused to advance, Saemon-no-jō gripped his hands in sweat and ground his teeth, saying 'If Hōki-no-kami will not advance, then so be it. Honda Nakatsukasa-no-kami and Saemon-no-jō are of the same mind. If Hōki-no-kami will not advance, then we shall go to meet them at Obata.' With about 500 men they pressed through below the Kampaku's formation, went to Obata Castle, offered their services as escort, and returned to Komaki. Both enemy and ally praised Honda Nakatsukasa."

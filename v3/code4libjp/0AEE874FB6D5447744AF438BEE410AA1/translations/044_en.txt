Now, I would like to discuss the Yoshida Shrine in some detail. As to when this shrine originally existed, there is an old founding record (koenki) preserved in the Ishida family home, which was formerly a family of shrine priests. This was written by Ishida Masatoshi. According to the Ishida family records, this Masatoshi was a person from the so-called Genki-Tensho period, his father was called Tomotoshi, and his uncle Masaharu died of illness en route while attempting to go to Kyoto in response to a summons from Maeda Toshiie in Tensho 19. If this founding record was indeed written by Masatoshi, then it dates from a period not far removed from the Tenbun era.

According to what it records, this shrine was founded in the first year of Tenji during the time of Emperor Sutoku, but later when Minamoto no Yoritomo unified the realm and was in Kamakura, he heard from afar of the remarkable divine efficacy of this shrine and donated shrine lands. Legend also claims that Yoritomo's retainer Adachi Morinaga constructed the shrine buildings.

Indeed, since Morinaga was the administrator of Mikawa Province, there are various places throughout Mikawa that are said to have been constructed by him. Temples like Horaiji and Zaigaji are of this type - Horaiji still preserves the ancient forms of dengaku folk performing arts, a vestige of the Kamakura period, and Zaigaji's mountain gate has been designated as a specially protected building as Kamakura period architecture. At Yoshida Shrine too, in the ritual performances of festivals, figures appear dressed as Yoritomo and other Kamakura period warriors, and there is also something called sasa-odori (bamboo grass dance), which might also be considered a remnant of dengaku traditions.

From this perspective, it certainly seems to have connections to Yoritomo, but unfortunately no evidence whatsoever can be found for this. However, in the old records of Goshinji Temple, it states that Yoshida Shrine was originally within the precincts of Goshinji Temple, and Goshinji Temple was at that time located where the current castle grounds are. When the Makino clan first built Imahashi Castle in Eisho 2 under orders from Imagawa Ujichika, Goshinji Temple was moved to its current location, with the moving expenses provided by the Imagawa house. At that time, at the request of the Makino family, only Yoshida Shrine was left in its original location as before. This seems quite factual, and according to documents by Yoshimoto and his son Ujizane recorded in the Yoshida Meiseki Soroku, it can be seen that Makino Denzo donated 6 kan 100 mon in shrine lands to this shrine. Therefore, this shrine undoubtedly existed from ancient times together with Goshinji Temple.

However, it came to exist as an independent shrine when Imahashi Castle was built. Makino Kohaku enshrined it as the castle's tutelary deity, and during the time of his son Shigekatsu (or Nobushige), its foundation was further established - this seems most factual.

Particularly, the deity enshrined here is Susanoo-no-Mikoto, but is commonly called Gozutennō, a god that the Makino clan had revered since their time in Ushikubo. Later, after repeated military conflicts, it was on the verge of falling into decay when Yoshimoto undertook major reconstruction here, donating a portable shrine and reviving festival ceremonies.

The name "Yoshida Shrine" itself was undoubtedly given after this area's place name was changed to Yoshida, so it must have been named either by Makino Shigekatsu or by Imagawa Yoshimoto.

Yoshimoto's management of Yoshida Shrine was roughly as described above, but the Suzuki Nobumichi family, former shrine priests of Kumano Shrine in Uomachi district, also preserves quite valuable old documents. These date from Tenbun 23 and are records that surveyed the lands of Kumano Shrine and its subsidiary shrines Hakusan and Tenpaku, even determining the portions for the shrine priests. Though these are fragmentary, they provide valuable insight into Yoshimoto's administrative methods and are therefore precious. However, whether these documents are originals from that time or copies is somewhat difficult to determine, though they are certainly not later forgeries.

As an aside, both the Ishida family mentioned earlier and this Suzuki family are old families within the current city. According to their genealogies, the Suzuki family ancestors came to this area from Kumano in Kii Province during the Bunji period. Also, according to the testament of Ryunenji Temple's head priest Sōkan from Tenbun 9, it records that the Ishida family collectively donated 1 kan 900 mon worth of fields to Kōtokuji Temple. Therefore, it can be seen that the Ishida family had already established itself as a distinguished household before the Tenbun period.

The matters concerning shrines and temples are roughly as described above, but beyond this, Yoshimoto also established laws for markets and post horses. From today's perspective, he could be said to have been a person with considerable legal thinking. Even things like fish wholesalers in this area were [established by] Yoshi[moto]...

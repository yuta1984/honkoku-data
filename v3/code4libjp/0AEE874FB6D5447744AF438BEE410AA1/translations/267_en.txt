Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (National Learning Scholars in Yoshida and Hatano Takao) 506

So the circumstances of Kozan's confinement in Yoshida were as I described earlier, but the location was a place called Old Shinchō (pronounced "Shinchō"), which was outside the Inner Akumi Gate. Today it corresponds to the area west of the center of the 18th Regiment's shooting range where a well remains. This is based on firsthand accounts from elderly residents, so I believe there should be no mistake, but when I previously mentioned that this location was in Kawage-machi, that was speaking in general terms—to be precise, it is as described above, so I would like to make this correction as well.

As for when the restrictions on Kozan's confinement were relaxed so that he could meet with anyone, there is something called "Record of Return and Development" written by Kozan himself included in the Collection of Leisure Hours, which states:

"In the year of earth-boar of Ansei, I became involved in official discussions, received censure and was confined in Toyohashi Castle. In the spring of the year of water-boar I was first released, visited my mother once in the northern lakes region, and in that year was granted residential land south of the castle, appointed as instructor, and commanded to reform educational administration."

Since this refers to the spring of Bunkyū 3 (1863), it was precisely when Shogun Iemochi had gone to Kyoto and Domain Lord Nobuhisa was serving as Osaka Castle keeper. At that time in Osaka, not only was Nishimura Jiuemon active, but Kojima Kansō was also greatly trusted. Kozan was permitted to reside in the aforementioned Ōte Long Houses that year, and was also appointed instructor at the Jishūkan academy that year. However, some elderly people relate that this appointment as instructor was still kept confidential from the shogunate.

From that time, Kozan also took students into his own home, but permission for his wife and children to come from Edo was granted much earlier, during Man'en 1 (1860) while he was still imprisoned. A poem from that time reads:

On the 26th day of the 3rd month of the year of metal-monkey, wife and children arrived from Edo
"At twenty I gained considerable fame in poetry circles / Before the flowers, my gallant spirit moved people to surprise / Who would think that in this tiny room of confinement / I could welcome wife and children and get drunk celebrating spring"

I should also mention here that there was a foot-soldier inspector assigned to Kozan's house, though elderly residents have various memories about this. However, I believe this was naturally during his imprisonment period, so it would be reasonable to assume that this surveillance was already removed after he moved to the Ōte Long Houses.

I would also like to mention the matter of the Nankō Shrine. I believe that Kozan's establishment of the Nankō Shrine in his front garden occurred after he moved from the aforementioned Ōte Long Houses to the house with the large pine tree in present-day West Eighth District. This is where the accounts of various elders agree, and Kozan moved from the Ōte Long Houses to the house in West Eighth District on May 8th of Meiji 1. Since this is clearly recorded in the diary of the former abbot Master Teishū, I think it can be regarded as fact. The poem that Hatano Takao composed in front of the Nankō Shrine in Meiji 2, which I mentioned earlier, was from the first time the Nankō festival was held, according to the memory of Master Todō.

Looking at it this way, I think it would be appropriate to place the founding of the Nankō Shrine at the end of Meiji 1 or the beginning of Meiji 2. However, Kozan was summoned to Tokyo in October of Meiji 1 and remained there until February of the following year. He returned to Yoshida again, but in December of the same year 4, he finally decided to move to Tokyo, and his family vacated their Yoshida residence and went to the capital in February of the following year 5. Therefore, Kozan personally conducted the Nankō festivals for only about four years, from Meiji 2 to 4.

He entrusted this to Takao before going to the capital, but the elderly have conflicting memories about the circumstances of its founding. Fortunately, this is recorded in Kozan's "Record of Return and Development for the Year of Metal-Dragon":

"Arrived at Hada village and paid respects at the Nankō Shrine. The shrine was what I had planned with the two shrine priests Kusakato and Hatano in former years, petitioning the domain lord for its new construction. After I departed east, it was moved here, and seasonal festivals and rituals are not neglected. On this day, Hiraiwa, Kaneko, Nagao, Nakano, Saitō, Sano—all these gentlemen came and together conducted the festival ritual. The sincerity of Master Hatano and the deep righteousness of these gentlemen are all praiseworthy."

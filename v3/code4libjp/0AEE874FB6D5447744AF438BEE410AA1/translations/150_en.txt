**Main Text:**
1. Main streets should strictly observe government regulations, and no improper conduct should be shown toward travelers. If there are such people, they should immediately be reported to the magistrate from within the town, and if they are concealed and discovered later, it will be considered a serious fault.

1. Even acquaintances other than travelers should not be allowed to lodge if they are suspicious. For relatives or those with proper credentials, officials should be consulted and instructions obtained. Places that do not regularly operate as inns should not provide lodging to travelers without reason. When people from other domains must be accommodated due to unavoidable circumstances, this should also be reported to officials and their instructions followed.

1. Commercial goods should not be sold at high prices. Moreover, worthless items should not be sold. Suspicious items should not be accepted as collateral, and if they are later discovered to be stolen goods, the person will be considered equally guilty.

Addition: All commercial activities should be conducted so as not to obstruct roads and highways.

1. Gambling and all forms of wagering are strictly prohibited.

Addition: Gatherings and idle talk that cause disturbances even to the neighborhood are unnecessary.

1. Retainers should never be sent around on errands. Since this matter has been communicated to the retainer band, this should be understood. If retainers wander about improperly and lower ranks commit violent acts, this should be reported to the magistrate, with care taken to ensure no harm comes to those individuals later.

1. Towns and rural areas should not store weapons improperly or harbor rōnin.

Addition: Fire prevention should be taken very seriously, with each town and village coordinating to prepare appropriate fire-fighting equipment and each house hanging water buckets.

1. Marriage ceremonies, temple and shrine donations, memorial services, and such should be conducted according to one's station.

In general, clothing and all other matters should avoid ostentation and luxury.

Shōtoku 2, 11th month

*Inset: Map from the time of Nobutoki's domain transfer*

There is also a very interesting map from that period that fortunately still remains in the Ōkōchi family. This was originally from the Makino period, but new red ink annotations were added to designate the residences of the Ōkōchi family's retainers, that is, the Matsudaira clan's retainers. It truly shows the situation at the time of the domain transfer as if one were seeing it firsthand, and I think it represents the most valuable historical material. To give one or two examples from it: the residence where Fujie Takeemon, the chief retainer of the Makino clan during their time at the castle, had lived now has the name of Nishimura Jiemon of the Ōkōchi family written in red ink, and the residence where Higuchi Ichizaemon of the Makino family had lived now has the name of Yusa Heima of the Ōkōchi family written in. The fact that red ink annotations have been made down to such minute details throughout is quite fascinating.

Now, under roughly these circumstances, Nobutoki first became lord of Yoshida Castle. But returning again to earlier events, at that time the previous shogun Ienobu had died, and his heir Prince Nabematsu was, as you know, still a four-year-old child, who became the seventh shogun Ietsugu.

However, this person also died in Shōtoku 6 at merely eight years of age, so misfortune continued for the Tokugawa house. But as I mentioned earlier, the previous shogun Ienobu was truly an outstanding person who particularly employed Arai Hakuseki and trusted that Manabe Norikatus. Although his term was only four years, his achievements were quite remarkable, and the so-called "Shōtoku administration" was implemented. Consequently, after his death, these two men assisted the young lord Ietsugu and sincerely and zealously handled the affairs of the realm. Of course, there was some criticism of these two men at the time for wielding great political power while supporting a young lord, especially since Norikatus held the position of personal attendant to the shogun, but the fact that both men acted without personal ambition and with sincerity is recognized by later generations. For this reason, the Tokugawa realm continued peacefully and proceeded smoothly.

Also, as mentioned in the previous chapter, Kuze Shigeyuki, who had once been lord of this Yoshida, entered the ranks of senior councilor from junior councilor on August 3 of this Shōtoku 3. Now, the one who became the eighth shogun after Ietsugu's death was, as you all know, Tokugawa Yoshimune, who was from the Kishū house...

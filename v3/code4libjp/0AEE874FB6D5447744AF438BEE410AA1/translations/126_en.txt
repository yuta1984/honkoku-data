⦿Yamada Sōhen and Ogasawara Tadatomo

Yamada Sōhen was, as mentioned in the previous chapter, a master of the tea ceremony, and his school is recognized as the Sōhen-ryū, a distinct tea ceremony school that has gained general recognition for its fame. This person was originally the son of Dōgen, a monk at Chōtoku-ji temple of the Jōdo Shinshū Ōtani sect at Nihonmatsu in Kyoto. His name was Shūkaku, later called Shūgaku, and his original family name was Nishina. The surname Yamada was adopted later from his mother's side. He was born in Kan'ei 1 (1624). Later, his father Dōgen moved to Ibaraki Gobō in Settsu Province, but in his old age he transferred the temple to his adopted son Shūkei. For reasons that are now unclear, when Sōhen was 26 years old, Dōgen retired to this Yoshida. Consequently, Sōhen also followed his father and came to live in this area.

However, prior to this, Sōhen had entered the way of tea at age six and became a disciple of Kobori Enshū. Records vary as to whether he received certification at age 16 or 22. Afterward, despite also studying under Furuta Oribe, who was Enshū's teacher, he was somehow not satisfied, so in Shōhō 4—about two years before moving to Yoshida—he entered the school of Sen no Sōtan.

This Sōtan was, as you all well know, the grandson of the famous Sen no Rikyū (Sōeki). Rikyū's eldest son was Dōan, and his second son was Sōjun, also known as Shōan. This Shōan's eldest son was precisely this Sōtan. Sōhen studied under him for nine years. During this period, although he had moved to Yoshida, he frequently went to Kyoto and established hermitages in the areas of Narutaki and Kinutana. Eventually he mastered the profound secrets of Rikyū's tea way and received full transmission. At that time, as proof of the Rikyū tradition, he was given the hereditary Shihō kettle, and from then on he called his hermitage Shihō-an. He also took the name Rikii-sai, alternatively Jokanja. The reason for taking the name Rikii-sai derives from the phrase "totsu totsu rikii ki," and Rikyū's death poem also contains the phrase "rikii ki totsu." Since his master Sōtan took the name "Totsu totsu-sai," Sōhen came to use "Rikii-sai," where the character 囗 is an abbreviation of 囲.

Thus, in Meireki 1 (1655), when Sōhen was 32 years old, he first entered service with the tea ceremony under Ogasawara Tadatomo, the lord of this domain. His introducer was said to be Kira Kōzuke-no-suke. At this time Sōhen received a stipend of 30 koku and support for 5 retainers. His second son Sōoku later received 100 koku and resided in Mitsume, Honjo, Edo. Sōhen is said to have lived at Chikui-ken within Goshin-ji temple in this area at that time, though he of course frequently went to Edo and stayed for long periods at places like Daifuku-ji in Hamana District, Tōtōmi Province.

Sōhen had previously inherited from his master Sōtan both the Fushin-an, the hereditary hermitage name of the Sen family since Rikyū, and Kyōnichi-an, the hermitage name used by Sōtan. This is said among tea families to have occurred four years before Sōtan's death. If this is true, it would have been around Meireki 1, precisely when Sōhen received full transmission from his master.

However, despite the Sen family having descendants, the fact that Sōhen specifically inherited Rikyū's orthodox lineage and came to use the name Fushin-an apparently caused some controversy later, as can be inferred from a letter that Sōhen sent to the head priest of Jōen-ji in this city, which is still preserved at the home of Mr. Takasu Yoshisaburō in Kanejaku-te in our city today.

Moreover, in Sōhen's work "Rikyū Tea Utensil Illustrated Guide," there is a preface written in Genroku 15 (1702) by someone called Sodō, which states:

"Who is Sōhen? He is a distinguished disciple of the elder Sōtan of the Sen family, who mastered the way transmitted by Sōeki and Shōan and inherited Fushin-an. However, since Sōtan had many descendants, he did not rashly change the name, and continued to be called Shihō-an for years. In the winter of the previous year of Kinoe-Tora [Enpō 2, 1674], responding to someone's request, he raised the plaque of Shihō-an, and following his disciples' recommendation, hung the plaque of Fushin-an at his tea house. From this time he became known as the fourth-generation Fushin-an of Sōeki."

From this we know that Sōhen publicly began using the name Fushin-an from the winter of Enpō 2, and the circumstances become much clearer. Also, in the preface of another work called "Chadō Benmō-shō," it states:

"In the medieval period there was Jōō, who became famous in the world through the method of tea preparation. Jōō transmitted this to Rikyū, and Rikyū added further refinements, making the method flourish and earning respect from lords of various provinces. Children danced [in joy at the mention of] Rikyū, and even servants knew of the Sen family. The world considered him the tea master of a hundred generations. Rikyū transmitted this to Shōan, and Shōan transmitted it to his heir Sōtan. Sōtan by nature preferred reclusion..."

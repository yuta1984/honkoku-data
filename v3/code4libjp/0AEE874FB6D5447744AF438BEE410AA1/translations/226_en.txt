Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Matsudaira Nobuhisa's Succession) 424

It seemed to be the case, and it was truly troublesome. However, when it came to the stage of decisively choosing between opening the country or maintaining isolation, he took a rather hardline isolationist position and would not consent. Of course, even those in key positions within the shogunate did not necessarily desire to open the country. If possible, they would have liked to expel the foreigners, but at present their military preparations were utterly inadequate and their finances were also extremely impoverished, so they thought it best to temporarily use expedient measures to manage foreign relations and, if they were fortunate enough to find an opportunity, it would not be too late to carry out the expulsion of foreigners again. However, Nariaki's opinion, as I mentioned before, was the most hardline isolationist position, so his views did not align with the shogunate council, which I believe was at least one cause of political turmoil.

But in this situation, another great misfortune occurred—the death of Shogun Ieyoshi.

**The Death of Shogun Ieyoshi**
Ieyoshi fell gravely ill just as this unprecedented national crisis was unfolding, and finally passed away on June 22nd of that year. His heir Iesada was originally a person of poor health and certainly not someone who could make decisions on such grave matters.

**The Succession of Heir Iesada**
So when Ieyoshi's illness became critical, he summoned Isenokami to his sickbed, entrusted him with future affairs, and said that for future matters, the only option would be to restore Mito Nariaki and have him come to the castle to consult on foreign affairs. Of course, Isenokami also felt the necessity of cooperating with Nariaki under these circumstances, and figures like Matsudaira Yoshinaga and Shimazu Nariakira also advocated that there was no choice but to rely entirely on him. This showed that winning over Nariaki's heart at that time was indeed the way to win over the hearts of people throughout the realm.

Therefore, on July 3rd, Isenokami finally restored Nariaki and had him participate in shogunate councils, and also had letters sent to his retainers such as Fujita Toko to persuade them. The shogunate council ultimately decided to widely seek the opinions of daimyo and retainers regarding opening or closing the country. As you know, this matter of listening to the opinions of daimyo and retainers has been considerably debated among later historians, who argue that this actually caused a boiling over of debates, the shogunate's authority fell to the ground, creating the evil of private scholars making presumptuous arguments, ultimately leading to its decline and fall. But I think that the shogunate's prestige had gradually been declining, and this deterioration

was certainly visible to the daimyo as well. However, as long as matters did not involve foreign countries, there had never been any resistance from the daimyo. But now that these were negotiations with foreign countries, and at this crucial time when national unity was essential regardless of circumstances, the extreme isolationist policy that the shogunate had maintained for many years could not possibly be suddenly redirected toward opening the country. Yet if they maintained the same isolationist ideology as before, the nation might well be placed in a perilous position. Under these circumstances, the shogunate had no choice but to decide according to public deliberation and adopt an attitude of respecting public opinion, wanting to unite the hearts of people throughout the realm in whatever way possible. I believe this must be understood as an inevitable fate driven by natural forces.

◉ Foreign Affairs Issues and Yoshida Domain

So what was the tendency of our Yoshida Domain at that time? I think this is something that must be mentioned here briefly. At that time, the person who held the most important position as chief retainer (kokuro) in Yoshida Domain was Wada Hajime. This person was born in September of Kansei 12 (1800) and had already served the Okouchi family for generations, wielding considerable influence. His name was originally Motonaga, and later he received a character from Nobuhisa's name and changed it to Hisamoto, taking the pen name Chosentei. He was skilled in poetry and calligraphy, and was also extremely adept at appraising paintings and calligraphy.

**Nishimura Jiuemon**
At that time there was another chief retainer named Nishimura Jiuemon, who also held an important position in the domain. This person's name was Tamekane, his pen name was Hoan, and he was well-versed in ancient and modern learning and skilled in martial arts.

At that time, the domain school Jishukan had Nishioka Suien as professor, and Yamamoto Kensai and others as supervisors. This Nishioka Suien was the second son of Nishioka Tenshin, whom I mentioned briefly before. His name was Sen, his courtesy name was Suemichi, and his common name was Sukezo. He first received instruction from his father and later studied under Ota Kinjo. He was most accomplished in the Book of Songs (Moshi) and had a character that was modest and reticent.

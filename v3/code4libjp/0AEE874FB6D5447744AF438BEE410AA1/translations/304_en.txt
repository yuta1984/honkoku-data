Repentance of the Public Authority

Since the return of the imperial edict, I believe the matter concerns how the expulsion of foreigners will be resolved. At present, this is truly a more precious and extremely crucial time than the so-called "moment worth a thousand gold pieces," so I humbly present my humble views without regard for severe punishment. Generally speaking, nothing happens by chance, nothing occurs without reason. As a certain scholar's poem states, "The rise and fall of nations is not by chance, human fortune and misfortune are not without reason." When it comes to matters affecting the security of the realm and the life and death of all people, the origins and fundamental causes are naturally very distant and very deep. Therefore, this time the various domains have petitioned the throne through conspiracy, with Satsuma and Chōshū domains being especially close to the emperor. Moreover, the rōnin of Sanyō, Nankai, and western provinces have risen up in swarms, raising banners, saying they will escort the imperial palanquin to Hakone, and to shake off lethargy they will first execute the Kyoto deputy, and regardless of the bakufu they will issue imperial edicts for expelling foreigners to the various circuits - such disturbances are mentioned in your volume. Though I cannot presume to know the actual facts, reasoning from the principle that things are neither accidental nor purposeless, I believe such disturbances are naturally inevitable forces.

Therefore, regarding His Majesty's Three Policies, if you first carefully consider the principle that things are neither accidental nor purposeless, and thoroughly reflect upon and understand the origins and sources of these matters, then completely

Your true intentions will be expressed, and the unavoidable circumstances will be understood in detail. In that case, whether to carry out or decline these policies, and their merits and demerits, will naturally become clear at a glance, and as the ancient teaching says, "turning misfortune into blessing,"

I believe the relationship between court and military government will fortunately be consolidated for ten thousand generations. However, if this is not the case, and there is still no reflection upon or understanding of those origins and sources, and you continue unchanged with the narrow view of a frog in a well, reasoning from ordinary petty rules, then the great outside domains will

despise the bakufu and plan rebellion, using the expulsion of foreigners as a pretext to manipulate the court and court nobles, and especially

His Majesty's intentions will become highly suspicious, and the articles of the Three Policies will be thought of only as completely unreasonable demands. In that case,

His Majesty's true intentions and vigorous determination will ultimately not be achieved,

Not only will there be no harmony between court and military government, but even those Satsuma and Chōshū domains and other outside domains will indeed become completely rebellious, ultimately losing the opportunity to reflect, understand, and turn misfortune into blessing. The previously mentioned connection of "a thousand gold pieces hanging by a single hair" will also be severed. Even if

the bakufu hereafter greatly rouses itself and demonstrates martial vigor, since the fundamental basis for such arousal

lies in discord between court and military government, ultimately the righteous spirit of national unity and solidarity in the imperial country will be difficult to achieve, and in the end the great policy of expelling foreigners will not be accomplished.

This is what I fearfully surmise. Therefore, while your inquiry seems to focus specifically on the merits and demerits of the Three Policies, I, your foolish retainer, without regard for presumption and without fearing what should be avoided, secretly consider the origins and background, and first present this as the primary point. Next,

regarding the Three Policies, I present them with the intention of "probing the source and clearing the source, cutting the roots and withering the branches." Furthermore, regarding the differences between Satsuma and Chōshū domains, the various intentions of court nobles and rōnin being mixed between good and evil, making vigilance necessary - though it is long-winded and presumptuous to exceed my position, I humbly present my thoughts by establishing the following articles.

Being compelled to do so in the final chapter of the Three Policies, I stopped writing this draft on the night of the 3rd.

**Deep and Distant Origins and Sources, with Details of the Single Hair Between Court and Military**

In the 6th year of Kaei, year of the Water-Ox, 6th month (I will not discuss the bakufu's administrative oversights and confused policies before this time, as it would be presumptuous), several American ships arrived at Uraga, ostensibly displaying military might but actually demanding trade for profit. Like second-hand clothing dealers in Yanagiwara, Edo, taking advantage of naive country people, ordinary commercial profit-seeking should generally be sought through humble and respectful language, but instead they used high-handed authority, mockery and abuse, employing deceptive schemes to seek great profit. Though the scale differs vastly, the actual situation was exactly the same. At that time, from the realm's men of purpose to common townspeople and servants, there was no one who did not gnash their teeth in anger. Nevertheless, at that time, through temporary expedient measures, even their arrogant rudeness was forcibly endured, and the request for trade and communication was granted. This was done after consultation with Lord Nariaki of Mito and others, beginning with Satsuma and Higo (these three domains had been concerned about the country and working for reform for twenty years prior, and were considered models for other domains and voices of public opinion), and other domains as well. Indeed, military

**Toyohashi City Historical Discourse** (The Transfer of Matsudaira Tadatoshi) 206

**Main Text**
When asked this, he replied that they were Yasusada, Matsudaira Yogoemon [name withheld], Ōhara Shuri Hisanobu, Sakai Zengozaemon [name withheld], Okada Magoemon [name withheld], and Itakura Shichibē [name withheld]. Since these were all well-known men, no additional soldiers were provided.

This is what was written. Also on this day, a merchant from Sakai named Kashio Sōgu came to Yoshida and met with Ieyasu here to report on conditions in Osaka and Sakai, as recorded in the "Sunpu-ki" (Records of Sunpu). According to the "Ietada Nikki Zōho" (Supplemented Diary of Ietada) and other sources, on this same day Hachisuka Iemasa arrived at this location by sea from Awa and requested an audience with Ieyasu, but was told there was no need for an audience and to proceed directly to Edo, whereupon he immediately departed for Edo.

Ieyasu arrived in Okazaki on the following 16th day, gradually proceeded westward, and entered Nijō Castle in Kyoto on the 23rd. Shōgun Hidetada also finally began his westward journey, and on October 18th, the bakufu issued regulations concerning military supply to various post stations along the route. {Regulations concerning military supply} Among these, the document issued to Goyu-machi is fortunately preserved at the residence of Hayashi Kojirō, whom I mentioned earlier. Although a document of nearly identical content is included in the "Sugiura Documents" {Tōtōmi} in the entry for the same date in "Dai Nihon Shiryō," and the one addressed to Goyu-machi is also said to be included in "Mikura-hon Kobunsho-san," the original actually still exists with the Hayashi family as mentioned before, so I will present the full text below.

Hayashi Document: Regarding the current military campaign, rice, soybeans, bran, straw, firewood and other miscellaneous items should be announced to all villages and brought out to the roadways for sale so that all people will not want for anything.

1. Regarding lodging fees for military personnel: 2 mon in copper coins per person, 6 mon in copper coins per horse. However, if the military personnel burn their own firewood, no lodging fee shall be charged.

1. Regarding requisitions in lieu of payment, this should be enforced as prohibited before, and care should be taken regarding outside interference and discussion.

1. Villages should be notified to provide horses for transportation along the roadways so that military personnel will not lack for anything. Even if military personnel have no horses and are turned away, they should not be refused passage from the previously designated stations. Even if horses become exhausted, pack horse fees should be arranged so that baggage does not become delayed up to the designated location. Pack horse fees should be as previously established. The above.

Among these, Do Ōi refers to Doi Ōi-no-kami Toshikatsu, An Tsushima to Andō Tsushima-no-kami Shigenobu, Sake Bingo-no-kami to Sakai Tadatoshi, and Sake Utanokami to Sakai Tadayo, all of whom were controlling bakufu administration at the time. In addition to this, military orders were distributed and regulations posted.

Hidetada's Departure: During this time, affairs in Kantō were also settled, so Hidetada departed Edo on the 23rd leading over 50,000 troops, arriving at Yoshida on the 29th. He too hastened his march and entered Fushimi Castle on November 10th. At this time on the Osaka side, Ōno Harumaga and others first took positions as staff officers and frequently sent proclamations in all directions to summon those who had received favors from the Taikō. However, aside from Sanada Yukimura and Gotō Mototsugu, they were all masterless samurai, and no daimyo of note responded. Nevertheless, since these men fortified themselves in the famous castle of the realm, prepared to die, it seems that no matter how Ieyasu and Hidetada attacked with 1.3 million besieging troops, it would not be easy to capture. Indeed, Ieyasu departed Nijō Castle on November 15th

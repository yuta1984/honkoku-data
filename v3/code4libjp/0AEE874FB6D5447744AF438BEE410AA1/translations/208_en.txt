**Matsudaira Nobuyori's Character and Conditions in Yoshida During His Time as Domain Lord**

**Nobuyori's Character and Conduct**
Now, as I mentioned before, Nobuyori was truly a person of frugal principles who frequently issued orders for economy throughout the domain. The main thrust of these policies seems to have always followed his father Nobuaki's approach. Therefore, his combination of leniency and strictness was always appropriate, and particularly regarding his character, as I mentioned before, he often displayed magnanimous qualities. Within this there was also truly meticulous attention to detail. When he served as Osaka castle keeper and later as Kyoto deputy, a painter named Yamada Dōsetsu accompanied him.

**Yamada Dōsetsu**
This man was a disciple of Tani Bunchō and quite skilled. Nobuyori regularly had this painter make copies of various things they encountered, collecting and binding them together. These remain in the Ōkōuchi family collection today. Looking at them, one finds even contemporary printed materials like kabuki advertisements pasted in. What I find particularly interesting is that one night when a large spider appeared in Osaka castle and was killed, because it was unusually large, he had the aforementioned Dōsetsu sketch it and preserved it with notes on the spider's dimensions and the date it appeared. In this way, he paid close attention even to minute details, carefully organizing and preserving them. While this may have stemmed from Nobuyori's particular interests, I think it also reflects his meticulous nature.

As I mentioned in the previous chapter, from around age fifteen or sixteen, Nobuyori studied classical texts under Ōta Kinshō as his teacher and became quite accomplished at poetry composition. When his father Nobuaki died in Bunsei 2 and he inherited the headship, he soon returned to his domain. At that time, Kinshō also came to Yoshida and remained in this area for about a year...

That is, Nobuyori arrived in Yoshida on July 25, and Kinshō remained in this area until the following year, giving lectures on classical texts at Jishūkan academy. At the time, Nobuyori invariably attended these lectures himself. Around this same time, he also summoned the aforementioned Nakayama Biseki to give lectures on Japanese and Chinese texts.

**Nakayama Biseki**
This person mainly took charge of lectures on national learning. Originally, Biseki came from a family of modest stipend, with the common name Tamezō, later called Yasuke, and his father was named Kiyokatsu. He was initially appointed as a customs official at Arai in Enshū. However, he was truly a devoted scholar who studied national learning under the famous Motoori Ōhira. In the late years of Nobuaki's life, in the fifth month of Bunka 14, he was summoned to Yoshida and appointed assistant instructor at Jishūkan academy.

Later, when Nobuyori was stationed in Osaka and Kyoto, this man constantly accompanied him without fail, giving lectures on Japanese and Chinese texts and explanations of waka poetry, and eventually seems to have served as a political advisor as well. Therefore, Nobuyori became quite accomplished in waka poetry. As I briefly mentioned before, among the works this Biseki left behind are his Court Diary that I already discussed in the previous chapter, as well as the Osaka Diary and Kyoto Diary. These are all written in diary format, recording in detail everything related to himself during his service to Nobuyori, and I believe they are invaluable for understanding that period.

**Osaka Diary and Kyoto Diary**
Moreover, these frequently describe how Nobuyori was a diligent student. These books are currently preserved by his descendants' family, and recently our city's historical compilation office has made copies, so they will eventually be housed in the city library.

Also, two of Nobuyori's notebooks fortunately remain in the Ōkōuchi family storehouse. These are simple notebooks with pencils that fit in the middle. They were probably used to jot down necessary things while traveling, and occasionally contain waka poems as well. While they may not provide major material for political history, they are quite interesting for understanding Nobuyori's daily life.

In summary, Nobuyori was an extremely modest person with a meticulous nature and considerable...

Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Mizuno Kenbutsu) 220

**Main Text**
...were at odds with him. How could Mizuno's boasts come true? Also, Kenbutsu constantly claimed that the weapons stored in the castle were beyond what others could match, but this was Kenbutsu's misunderstanding. No matter how many weapons one has, without harmony among people they are useless - as good as having none. Kenbutsu boasted of his own martial prowess, looked down on others, and without regard for rudeness or excessive words, spoke whatever boastful claims he pleased. Therefore, all the military officers of neighboring districts and provinces were at odds with him. Moreover, not a single person among the common people of his domain trusted him. Kenbutsu's boasting was not only useless but actually invited harm.

From this, it appears that Tadayoshi was quite stubborn and arrogant, with a nature that led him to speak his mind recklessly. However, he was loyal to his lord's house, and as a result, he seems to have maintained surveillance against houses like the Owari family, as in the story mentioned earlier. On the other hand, he had quite a generous spirit, making him someone who could never be completely dismissed. These are also stories found in volumes 13 and 20 of the same work, and I think records like the following reveal his true character quite vividly.

Mizuno Kenbutsu was very close to Aoyama Daizen, and they usually discussed matters of martial arts together. Once, Daizen said: "When I return to my domain, I will pass through your castle town. At that time, I would very much like to tour your castle." Kenbutsu replied: "That is exactly what I would wish. Please be sure to stop by. I shall offer you simple tea." Later, when Daizen passed through the castle town, he sent word requesting a visit. Kenbutsu was at the castle and was delighted, welcoming him into the castle and entertaining him well. Afterward, he accompanied him to a turret in the second bailey, and when Kenbutsu struck a drum three times, about a hundred mounted warriors rode out in formation from the castle to the area before the main gate. When a conch shell was blown, those warriors immediately circled to the rear attack route and took positions. Their speed was like flying birds. Daizen was greatly impressed. At this time, Kenbutsu said, "This is today's entertainment." Daizen reportedly said, "Since you do not pass through my castle town, I have nothing to show you - most regrettable indeed." This is from the tales of Yonezu Jūdayū.

When Mizuno Kenbutsu went to his lower residence to watch his retainers practice horsemanship and came out to the riding ground, a page carrying a document box was wandering around the riding ground...

...area. Startled by the sound of Kenbutsu coming out, he abandoned the document box in the riding ground and fled. Seeing this, Kenbutsu said, "I don't know whose document box this is, but I shall borrow it," and respectfully lifted it with his hands, bowed, and sat down. When he had the lid opened and looked inside, there were three rice balls wrapped in waste paper and two pairs of straw sandals. Seeing this, Kenbutsu was exceptionally pleased and called out the owner of the box, saying: "You are a warrior with admirable preparation. A samurai cannot perform martial duties on an empty stomach, so food and straw sandals are a warrior's most important possessions. You appear to be in straitened circumstances, as your rice balls are dark in color. I shall grant you an increase so you can have white rice." He immediately granted a three-koku increase in rice stipend.

⦿ Ogasawara Iki-no-kami

**Ogasawara Tadatomo** On January 11, Shōhō 2, when Mizuno Kenbutsu Tadayoshi was transferred to Okazaki Castle, the one who was enfeoffed at this Yoshida in his place was Ogasawara Iki-no-kami Tadatomo, who likewise held 45,000 koku. This person was the great-grandson of Shinano-no-kami Nagatoki, and his family originally descended from the Genji line, specifically from Shinra-Jirō Yoshimitsu, the third son of Minamoto no Yoriyoshi. For generations they resided in Shinano Province, but Nagatoki was based at Fukashi Castle (present-day Matsumoto) during the Tenbun era and was defeated by Takeda Shingen, fleeing to Echigo. His grandson Hidemasa later served the Tokugawa clan and in Keichō 18 was again enfeoffed at Matsumoto, the hereditary domain of his ancestors. However, on May 7, Genna 1, at age 47, he died in battle at Tennōji during the Osaka campaign. His third son was this Tadatomo, who was appointed ōbangashira in December, Kan'ei 3, also served as sōja from April 24, Kan'ei 9, and on October 11 of the same year was granted Kitsuki Castle in Bungo Province, joining the ranks of the hereditary vassals. This time he was transferred from Kitsuki to this Yoshida.

Originally the era name Kan'ei continued for twenty years, changing to Shōhō in the twenty-first year, but Shōhō lasted only four years, with the fifth year becoming Keian. In the fourth month of Keian 2, shrine officials and devotees petitioned the magistrate of temples and shrines for the grant of a vermillion seal for Uomachi Gongen Shrine. The draft of this petition still remains in Mr. Suzuki Nobuji's storehouse and is quite valuable for reference.

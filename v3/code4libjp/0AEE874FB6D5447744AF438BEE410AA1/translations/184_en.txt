does not make logical sense. Indeed, it is believed to be fact that Nobuaki was the main advocate for the direct management theory of Ezo development, and evidence of his earnest research into Ezo affairs continues to be discovered to this day.

In any case, the shogunate council, as I mentioned before, decided to develop Ezo through direct management, appointing Matsudaira Shinano-no-kami Tadaaki to guard Ezo territory, and similarly appointing Ishikawa Tadafusa, Habuto Shōzaemon Masayasu, Ōkōchi Masakazu, and Mitsuhashi Narikata to the same role. This Habuto Masayasu later became Aki-no-kami, and among his writings is one called "Kyūmeikōki," which is also a book about Ezo affairs, comprehensively recording everything from when he first became involved until Bunka 4, during his entire time in office.

This is truly an excellent record for understanding the circumstances of Ezo management at that time. Now, the shogunate proceeded with development on one hand while also promoting exploration of the northern seas on the other, so people like Mamiya Rinzō endured considerable hardships for these explorations.

**Mamiya Rinzō**

That is, he advanced from Sakhalin to enter the continent, crossed the Amur River, and even penetrated as far as Shanhaiguan. The shogunate also had Inō Tadayoshi survey Ezo territory in Kansei 12.

The map of Ezo that Tadayoshi himself created at that time is still preserved in the Ōkōchi family, and I believe this map is truly a masterpiece of the realm. I have no doubt this was also a result of Nobuaki primarily implementing this project at the time. Originally, this Inō Tadayoshi, as you all know, had been surveying the coasts of the entire country under shogunate orders since when Matsudaira Sadanobu was still in his senior councilor position.

However, after Sadanobu's retirement, it was Nobuaki who was most involved in these affairs, and all of Tadayoshi's maps of Japan, except for the aforementioned Ezo map, remain complete in the Ōkōchi family collection. Tokyo Imperial University also preserves maps almost identical to these, which were perhaps transmitted from the shogunate. Some years ago, when one of Tadayoshi's maps was discovered in the Hamamatsu area of Enshū, it became quite a sensational issue, but compared to those, what remains in the Ōkōchi family can truly be called supreme masterpieces and should serve as invaluable reference materials for academic purposes.

Now, the story has digressed somewhat, but to return to the beginning: as you know, the Kansei era was changed to Kyōwa in its thirteenth year, and in the second year of Kyōwa, the shogunate first established the position of Ezo Magistrate, appointing Habuto Masayasu and Togawa Chikuzen-no-kami Yasutomo to these posts. Needless to say, these were all during the period when Nobuaki was at the center of shogunate affairs.

**Ezo Magistrate**

However, as I mentioned before, Nobuaki resigned from his senior councilor position in the following year, Kyōwa 3, temporarily severing his connection with shogunate affairs. During his resignation, Kyōwa was changed to Bunka.

**《Small text: Russian envoy Rezanov comes to Nagasaki》**

In the first year of Bunka, the Russian envoy Rezanov came to Nagasaki, bringing the letter of passage previously given at Matsumae, earnestly requesting trade. The measures taken by the shogunate authorities at that time were quite inappropriate, so Rezanov also returned with great resentment. Later, in Bunka 3, the year of Nobuaki's return to office, Russian ships came again to Sakhalin, this time acting quite violently and capturing four soldiers before departing. In the fourth month of the fourth year, they again raided Etorofu Island and came to Rishiri, having the previously captured soldiers deliver a letter saying that if trade were not permitted, they would attack in force the following year.

**《Small text: Russian ships raid the northern seas》**

This matter then became a subject of shogunate deliberation, and at this time, Hayashi Jussai wrote down his complete opinion and submitted it to Nobuaki in a letter that still remains in the Ōkōchi family. This is quite interesting, so although it will be somewhat lengthy, I will gradually present it below.

**《Small text: Jussai's opinion submitted to Nobuaki》**

First, Jussai's letter begins by critiquing the events from when Rezanov came to Nagasaki:

"Considering deeply this great matter, no matter how it is resolved in the end, it cannot result in a perfect outcome, and truly this is a source of heartache beyond compare. Looking at the root of this problem, when the envoy came to Nagasaki, we missed a great opportunity and made mistakes in everything. No matter what we do from now on, it cannot be remedied. It is like misdiagnosing a seriously ill patient - once the symptoms change after one mistake in treatment..."

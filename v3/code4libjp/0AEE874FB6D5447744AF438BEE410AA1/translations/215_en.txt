Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobuaki and His Era) 402

He was called Kennosuke and was born on August 9, Bunsei 10. His birth family, as mentioned before, was from the Ōkōchi branch but was a hatamoto (direct shogunal retainer) with a stipend of about 1,000 koku, so his succession to the domain must have required considerable effort.

Now, on July 7, Kōka 2, when Nobuaki first came to his domain after succession and addressed all the retainers in his own hand at the great reception hall, I would like to present what he conveyed:

"This time I have unexpectedly come to inherit this house, for which I am grateful. Though I do not yet understand the particulars of all matters, I have long heard that the administration of this house through the generations has been exceptional. Though I am unworthy and inadequate, I will by all means encourage my resolve and make it my first priority not to let the family's reputation decline. I ask that you all understand this and exhaust your efforts to assist me. Should I forget my station and become negligent in governance, or should I become arrogant, please remonstrate with me without reserve. Regarding other matters, whether they should or should not be done, whatever your thoughts on any matter, please seal your written opinions and present them to the inspectors. I will adopt them based on their merit. Matters from the women's quarters should be submitted with proper discretion. Since we shall observe all the ancient systems of previous generations, each of you should serve without misunderstanding.
6th month of the year of the Boar"

From this proclamation, we can see that he humbly sought wisdom, being deeply conscious of rising from a lower position to inherit this Ōkōchi house.

At this point, I think it necessary to discuss the general situation of the realm at that time. As you know, foreign relations problems were gradually becoming complicated, society was becoming increasingly turbulent, and voices for "revere the emperor, expel the barbarians" were showing momentum to sweep across the land.

Originally, regarding the rise of this sonnō jōi doctrine, the Mito domain was indeed its chief proponent. As mentioned in the previous chapter, after Mizuno Echizen-no-kami's failure, Doi Toshitsura became senior councilor and took charge of shogunal administration. Toshitsura considered Mito's behavior extremely disagreeable and immediately adopted a policy of ostracizing the Mito house. As you all know, in the 5th month of Tenpō 15, through his arrangements, he ordered Nariaki into retirement

and ordered his retainers Toda Ginzaburō and Fujita Toranosuke (Tōko) into house arrest.

However, not only was it impossible to resist the general trend of the times with such measures, but it instead provoked popular sentiment, resulting in patriots throughout the land increasingly strengthening their friendship with Mito and gradually intensifying national debate.

Of course, at this time the Mito domain was also divided into two factions, and these two factions were mutually antagonistic, eventually ending in armed conflict. Shogunal administration was also truly disrupted from this point and could never again be restored to order.

Meanwhile, another disaster occurred, namely the burning of Edo Castle's main keep in the 5th month of Tenpō 15. At that time, the shogunate's finances had reached the extreme of poverty, and regarding reconstruction, Toshitsura made considerable efforts to solicit donations from the daimyo, but this ended in failure. Later, in the 8th month, Toshitsura finally resigned his position. The construction of the main keep was later undertaken when Abe Ise-no-kami Masahiro became senior councilor and chief magistrate of main keep construction, commanding 26 daimyo including the Lord of Kaga to provide assistance calculated at 500 ryō per 10,000 koku of stipend. However, since this still could not avoid enormous shortfalls, they again conducted currency debasement and mass production of debased coins to temporarily cover the situation, whereby the shogunate's finances inevitably fell into poverty upon poverty.

Now, during this confusion, in the 4th month of Tenpō 15, the Dutch submitted a letter stating: "This time England and France will dispatch envoys to your country seeking trade. We wish to advise you regarding this matter. Since these envoys are specially dispatched by their kings, they will bring appropriate military escorts. Therefore, we request that you provide suitable treatment."

The shogunate's alarm was extreme, but they finally recalled Mizuno Echizen-no-kami Tadakuni, making him senior councilor again in the 6th month of Tenpō 15 (Kōka 1) to handle this foreign relations crisis.

However, this Tadakuni served only nine months and was dismissed again in the 2nd month of Kōka 2 due to the well-known affair of Torii Kai-no-kami Yōzō, ultimately being stripped of income and ordered to relocate to Yamagata in Dewa province under house arrest.

Thereafter, Abe Ise-no-kami Masahiro became senior councilor and took control of shogunal administration, and from then on foreign relations...

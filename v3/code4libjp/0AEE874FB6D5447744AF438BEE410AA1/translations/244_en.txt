Therefore, however they might manage it, the majority hoped to obtain an exceptionally wise and capable leader to resolve the current crisis. Among some feudal lords and retainers, there were already those who wished to designate Hitotsubashi Yoshinobu as the heir.

*Subheading: The Conflict Between the Hitotsubashi and Nanki Factions*
However, supporting Yoshinobu's succession was not simply a matter of political preference. Rather complex emotions were involved. Consequently, there was another faction that sought to welcome Kii Yoshitomi as heir. This behind-the-scenes struggle over succession, intertwined with major foreign policy issues, further complicated domestic politics - a point that must be remembered. As you know, Hitotsubashi Yoshinobu was the seventh son of Mito Nariaki, who became heir to the Hitotsubashi house in August of Kōka 4 (1847) through Shogun Iesada's private instruction. Intelligent from childhood, he increasingly became the focus of popular expectations as he matured. While being Nariaki's son brought him many supporters, it also created opposition.

Originally, Yoshinobu was not given to the extreme statements and actions like his father Nariaki. Rather, he had frequently restrained and moderated his father. However, Nariaki's recent words and deeds were truly radical and completely incompatible with the shogunate. Therefore, it was natural that pro-shogunate feudal lords and retainers disliked Nariaki, and consequently found the idea of supporting Yoshinobu highly disagreeable.

However, as I have gradually explained from previous chapters, the Tokugawa shogunate was increasingly forced to listen to public opinion among the feudal lords, and each domain was similarly compelled to seek the opinions of their retainers. The so-called "loyalist activists" were spurred to action around this time, and their grassroots initiatives gradually influenced domain policies and eventually affected national public opinion. This naturally led to the emergence of numerous reformers of the age who sought to break down ancient abuses and establish new progressive governance.

In this regard, Nariaki should be considered a pioneer, and as a reformer of the age, he was truly revered by loyalist activists nationwide. Since these activists naturally resented that Nariaki had been distanced from the shogunate, their attempt to promote Yoshinobu to handle shogunate affairs could be called a natural development.

*Subheading: Matsudaira Yoshinaga's Efforts*
Of course, there were many such advocates among the feudal lords, but among them, Matsudaira Yoshinaga was foremost. As I mentioned earlier, he was lord of Echizen Fukui castle, descended from the Tayasu branch and a member of the related domains. Out of concern for the main Tokugawa house, he had gradually worried about the succession issue. Finding no suitable candidates among Owari, Mito, or Tayasu houses, and considering that Kii Yoshitomi was still under ten years old and unsuitable to succeed as shogun during this major crisis, he firmly believed that only Hitotsubashi Yoshinobu, with his age and character, could immediately serve as the shogun's right arm. Though he had long planned to support Yoshinobu, the timing had not yet arrived to make this public.

However, as you know, with Harris's arrival and other developments, foreign policy issues became increasingly frequent, creating what could be called a diplomatic crisis for our country. Yoshinaga came to feel acutely the urgency of the succession question, and he was not alone in this feeling - it became a major concern among feudal lords and retainers. Regarding Yoshinobu's support, his father Nariaki was also quite enthusiastic, reportedly writing secretly to his relative Takatsukasa Taikō around Ansei 3 (1856) to express his hopes. However, when this somehow leaked to the shogunate and Ii Naosuke's circle, it further intensified opposition vigilance.

Under these circumstances, Yoshinaga's plans could not proceed as hoped. Even Shimazu Nariakira, who had initially been a Yoshinobu supporter, by this time began showing some deference to the shogunate, and moreover...

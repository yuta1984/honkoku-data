Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (The Ōkōchi Clan Returns to Yoshida) 308

**Main Text:**
This was the general situation of the realm during the era when Nobunao was lord of Yoshida Castle, and since there will be necessary matters to discuss in later chapters, I will briefly describe them here. From now on, I would like to outline the main affairs of this region during Nobunao's reign.

Nobunao was, as I mentioned before, the eldest son of the previous lord Izu-no-kami Nobutoki, and his childhood name was Senshirō. He was born on April 4th of Kyōhō 4 (1719) at the lower residence in Yanaka, Edo. At age fifteen he first had audience with Shogun Yoshimune and heir apparent Ieshige, but when his father Nobutoki died on the night of April 18th of Enkyō 1 (1744), he inherited the domain on June 4th of the same year. Of course, this matter and also his transfer to Yoshida Castle in exchange with Matsudaira Sukenori on October 15th of Kan'en 2 (1749) have already been mentioned just now, so you are aware of these matters. The vermillion seal for his domain was issued on March 11th of Kan'en 4 (1751), and since the full text is very valuable for reference, I will reproduce it below:

Within Mikawa Province: 28 villages in Atsumi District, 39 villages in Yana District, 45 villages in Hōi District, 5 villages in Nukata District, 47 villages in Kamo District; within Tōtōmi Province: 17 villages in Shiki District, Kamo village in Jōtō District; within Ōmi Province: 20 villages in Asai District, 2 villages in Ika District, Shimokaidenvillage in Takashima District; total assessment 70,000 koku (detailed list on separate paper) - this grant is hereby completed, the status of the domain being as stated herein.

Kan'en 4, March 11th
To Matsudaira Izu-no-kami

Thus after Nobunao was transferred to Yoshida, the era name Kan'en changed to Hōreki in its fourth year, and Hōreki in turn changed to Meiwa after thirteen years. In the first year of Hōreki there was the death of former Shogun Yoshimune, and in the 6th and 10th years there were great fires in Edo. In that year Shogun Ieshige retired and his son Ieharu succeeded him and was appointed Seii Taishōgun. However, Ieshige died in June of the following 11th year, and in the 14th year the era name changed again to Meiwa. In February of this year, an envoy from Korea came to court. As you know...

...the Tokugawa shogunate from the beginning showed real goodwill toward Korea and treated their envoys as important honored guests. Indeed, in the Kaji district of Toyohashi City there still remains a map prepared with the notation "Regarding the visit of Koreans" and so forth. However, this is not from the Meiwa period but from a later time, though in any case, for Korean visits the domain lord ordered each town to submit such maps, which were presumably shown during Korean lodging.

During this Meiwa visit, they lodged at Gōshin Temple in Sekiya on February 5th, with great hospitality provided at the temple that day and at the rest station in Arai the following day. On their return journey they again lodged at this same Gōshin Temple on March 27th of the same year, with hospitality as before, according to records in the Ōkōchi family archives.

Moreover, according to Funa-machi records, already in Hōreki 1 (1751) shogunal officials were sent to Yoshida twice to inspect the great bridge in preparation for Korean visits. Both times a total of twenty-four or twenty-five people came, including construction magistrates, their officials, and subordinates. This truly gives us insight into the governmental practices of the Tokugawa period.

Then there were bridge construction projects in Hōreki 2, 4, 10, 13, and Meiwa 5. Among these, Hōreki 2 and Meiwa 5 involved complete reconstruction, while the others were repairs, but each time they sent many inspection officials from Edo, so it must have been quite an elaborate affair.

The events worth discussing from Nobunao's time are roughly these, but in September of Meiwa 5 (1768), Nobunao fell ill while residing in Yoshida Castle and finally died at noon on the 19th at age fifty. His remains were sent to Musashi Province and buried in the ancestral plot at Heirin Temple in Nobidome, and his posthumous name was Kenkōin.

⦿Matsudaira Nobunao and the People of His Era

Now I would like to discuss Nobunao's character a bit more, and as I briefly mentioned before, from Nobunao's childhood...

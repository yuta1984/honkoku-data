　　　　　　　　　"Although the postponement of the imperial visit has been announced, regarding the expulsion of foreigners, success shall be achieved promptly. Therefore, the loyalist domains shall carry out expulsion quickly without awaiting the shogunate's instructions" - such was the imperial will proclaimed.

　　　　　　This was also publicly announced to the domains in Kyoto. In any case, the political change described above was a major transformation of the times, and those most shaken were from Chōshū domain. They were on the verge of exchanging gunfire with Satsuma domain, but fortunately there were thoughtful people on both sides, so the Chōshū retainers peacefully withdrew from Sakaimachi gate to Daibutsu. At this time, court nobles who could be called the Chōshū faction gathered at the Takatsukasa house seeking rescue, and imperial edicts were conveyed to them. Ultimately, Chōshū domain decided to withdraw from Kyoto once and return to their home province. Sanjō Sanetomi and the well-known Seven Nobles eventually fled and headed to Chōshū. On this day, Yoshida domain also received orders to guard Kyoto, but being in Osaka, they were unable to participate in the events of the 18th.

　　　　　　Thus, the radical sonnō-jōi party led by Chōshū domain suddenly lost their influence in Kyoto. Earlier, when the Yamato imperial visit was announced on August 13th, as a precursor to this, the idea was to first proclaim righteousness in Yamato province and make that region's situation loyalist in advance. Based on this thinking, those who rallied around Imperial Attendant Nakayama Tadamitsu (who had earlier fled the court) included the well-known Fujimoto Tesseki, Matsumoto Keidō, and Shishido Yashirō. Among them, Matsumoto and Shishido were retainers of Kariya domain in Mikawa. These people entered Kawachi from Osaka on August 16th, then established their base in Totsukawa in Yamato, attempting to proclaim the great cause of imperial loyalty throughout the Yamato plain. This was the so-called Totsukawa rōshi group. Unfortunately, on the 18th, as mentioned before, the political change occurred in Kyoto, and the radical faction fell into adverse circumstances. Moreover, the Yamato imperial visit was suddenly canceled, so this group immediately faced the fate of being pursued and ultimately failed. Also, Hirano Jirō Kuniomi's attempt to raise troops at Ikuno silver mine under the Seven Nobles

member Lord Sawa Nobuyoshi occurred around the same time, but this also failed for almost the same reasons. Kuniomi was pitifully captured, and Lord Nobuyoshi also disappeared without a trace. Generally, the radical faction had long engaged in assassination and violence. As mentioned before, their aspirations were truly filled with imperial loyalty, but there was nothing noteworthy in terms of unified action. However, the Totsukawa rōshi incident and the Ikuno uprising were almost organized efforts - what might be called a step forward in revolution. Therefore, even if temporary respite was gained, the shogunate's fate was steadily approaching its ultimate end. Moreover, there was internal strife in Mito in the Kantō region, and in the following Genji era, uprisings centered around Fujita Koshirō and Takeda Kōunsai occurred, with continuous fighting between Hitachi and Shimōsa provinces, causing considerable disturbance. However, this also ultimately ended in failure, with Kōunsai and others meeting their tragic end in Tsuruga, Echizen, as you well know. In summary, by the end of Bunkyū 3, as just described, there was a temporary great setback for the expulsion party, and the situation completely changed to what could be called the era of the court-shogunate cooperation party. The people of this faction in Kyoto urgently sent word. Of course, there was some debate in the shogunate about this, but ultimately deciding on this matter, the shogun departed Edo at year's end and arrived in Osaka by sea on January 8th of the following Genji era (Bunkyū lasted until the third year, then changed to Genji in the fourth year). On February 15th, Matsudaira Katamori was temporarily relieved of his position as Kyoto Protector and appointed Military Commander-in-Chief, with Matsudaira Yoshinaga returning to serve as his replacement. However, this lasted only two months, and on April 7th, Katamori was restored to the position of Kyoto Protector, which was due to Katamori's

This sword has been in our family for generations, and I am determined to use it in service at the head of your cavalry. Therefore I cannot present it.' At this, Lord Kokusei became angry and reached for a naginata that was on a shelf, whereupon Bungo struck the lord's face hard with his fan and withdrew. Since this happened after drinking, the attendants calmed the situation, saying 'Leave Bungo to us,' and restrained him. Later, after the lord sobered up, he summoned Bungo even though it was late at night. Bungo resolved that he would be executed and immediately went to the castle. He was summoned directly to the lord's bedchamber, where the lord said: 'I was drunk and tried to strike you down. I was wrong. Do not let this trouble your mind at all.' Bungo wept involuntarily and withdrew. Most of Lord Kokusei's conduct was of this nature.

Of course, this story shows the admirable uprightness of the retainer Hatta Bungo, but in any case, the fact that Terumasa had many good retainers is truly admirable. The following story from the Ikeda Family Historical Summary truly reveals the source of this quality.

Yamawaki Gendayū (who first served Araki Settsu-no-kami Murashige and came to serve the Ikeda family after Araki's downfall) fell ill at Himeji in Harima Province. Though physicians did their utmost, there was no improvement. Lord Kokusei ordered that he go to Kyoto for better care, so he went to the capital and received medical treatment while lodging there. At this time, as a gesture of concern, the lord sent Yamawaki Ichidayū with a letter in his own hand inquiring about the illness. The letter inquired in detail about his condition and stated that he would soon visit the lodgings. Soon after, he departed Himeji and traveled all the way to Yamawaki Gendayū's lodgings in the capital, inquiring most kindly about his condition and saying repeatedly, 'If there is anything you wish to say, speak it now.' Yamawaki replied: 'There is nothing I need to say. Only, I have six men who have served under me for many years and have fought for me in every battle. I would like them to be given positions.' The lord said, 'That is an easy request to fulfill,' and wept. Then he went to wash his hands. When Nishimura Kobei brought water for washing, the lord asked, 'Are you also one of the six?' Nishimura prostrated himself and replied that he was. Thus Gendayū grew weaker day by day and finally died in Kyoto on the 19th day of the 8th month at age 54. This Gendayū was a brave warrior who had performed memorial services for thirty-three heads he had taken. [omitted] Lord Kokusei, following Yamawaki's dying wish, summoned Nishi-

mura Kobei, Okajima Shinbei, Furusawa Gennosuke, Fukushima Shirōzaemon, and two others - six men in total - and gave them positions.

However, Terumasa initially thought to employ relatively good retainers for as little stipend as possible, but he came to realize this was a great mistake. The following story, which might be called the catalyst for this realization, is also found in the Bizen Rōjin Monogatari and is quite instructive.

Iki Seibei, chief retainer to Lord Ikeda Sanzaemon, took ill and was near death when he said, 'I have a wish for this life. I want to see my lord's face one more time.' When Lord Sanzaemon heard this, he was alarmed and hastily went to his house, approaching his pillow and saying most kindly: 'What is it, Seibei? What troubles your heart? How negligent of me not to have known of such a serious matter. If you have something to say, speak it. I will grant your wish. Needless to say, there will be no problem with your son's succession.' Then Seibei raised his head, pressed his palms together, and said: 'I am most grateful for your visit. It is a supreme blessing. Please handle my son's inheritance as you see fit according to his abilities. Since it depends entirely on your judgment, I have no concerns about it whatsoever. But there is one thing I must say - if I die without saying this, it would be a foolish obsession, so I humbly speak. You have a habit of seeking bargains in all things. Especially your practice of seeking bargain retainers is not a good habit. Only by treating retainers better than their station warrants will they serve your house long and remain loyal.' Lord Sanzaemon listened intently and said: 'Your remonstrance is absolutely reasonable. Your loyalty is higher than mountains and deeper than the sea. I will not forget this while I live. Be at peace.' He took Seibei's hand, shed tears, and parted from him with obvious reluctance. It was a touching scene of lord-retainer devotion. After this, the family's traditions improved greatly.

There are many other anecdotes about Terumasa still preserved. In volume 12-11 of the Dai Nihon Shiryō, in the section on Terumasa's death, excerpts from various books are included as reference material. Particularly the portrait housed at Kokuseiji Temple in Okayama City and his autograph

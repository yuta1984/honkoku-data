Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (The Rise of Anti-Foreign Sentiment) 446

**Main Text:**
Since he was involved [in government affairs], he should have understood to some extent that the circumstances were unavoidable, but his dissatisfaction was not one-sided. As a result, he even shouted that Hayashi Daigaku-no-kami, the negotiator of the treaty with America, should be made to commit seppuku. However, Abe Ise-no-kami, the senior councilor whom I have been discussing since the previous chapter, found himself in a most difficult position between these factions and constantly endeavored to mediate, barely managing to avoid a complete breakdown.

*Subheading: The Clash Between Nariaki and Iga-no-kami and Others*
However, among the cabinet members, Matsudaira Iga-no-kami Tadamasa was a person of considerable backbone who frequently rejected Nariaki's proposals, leading to increasingly severe opposition between them. Eventually, Nariaki became so worked up that he demanded either Iga-no-kami's dismissal or his own retirement. Iga-no-kami apparently found this troublesome, and in August of Ansei 2, both he and fellow councilor Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami Norimasa were dismissed. This temporarily calmed Nariaki's anger and should be considered as satisfying the anti-foreign faction.

*Subheading: The Resistance of the Tamarizume Daimyo*
However, the troublesome thing was that this led to the emergence of another opposing force. This was none other than the tamarizume group, whose leader could be said to be Ii Kamon-no-kami Naosuke. As I mentioned before, Naosuke had already published arguments for opening the country since Perry's first arrival in Kaei 6. Since then, as foreign circumstances gradually became clearer, daimyo like those in the tamarizume group came to realize that opening the country was unavoidable, viewing the shogunate's measures as necessary and developing a tendency to reject the recklessness of the anti-foreign faction.

As you may know, these tamarizume daimyo were major daimyo from the house branches or hereditary retainer families who could not only respond to the shogun's consultations but also proactively offer advice. They formed not only the core of shogunal power but could be said to be supporters of the shogunal cabinet. Therefore, as they gradually came to understand foreign circumstances, they increasingly sympathized with the cabinet's measures and believed that supporting them was their loyal duty to the Tokugawa house.

*Subheading: Hotta Bitchu-no-kami Returns to the Cabinet*
At this point, Naosuke took the initiative to recommend Hotta Bitchu-no-kami, who had formerly been senior councilor, to rejoin the cabinet and planned to place him above Ise-no-kami. It appears that Ise-no-kami could not refuse this...

...and this was finally implemented in October of that year. Originally, this Bitchu-no-kami was a person who well understood that isolationist anti-foreign policies were absolutely unworkable, so when Nariaki and other anti-foreign faction members learned of this, they were initially shocked. But when they discovered that this came about through Naosuke's recommendation, they became increasingly concerned about their own positions, which became the primary cause of friction between the two factions favoring opening the country and expelling foreigners.

In summary, Ise-no-kami had until then maintained contact with Mito's Nariaki through considerable effort, thereby managing the various daimyo. But at this point, the views of shogunal officials and Nariaki became increasingly opposed, with no prospect of cooperation or harmony, only growing apart. This ultimately resulted in opposition from the tamarizume daimyo, who were supposed to be supporters of the cabinet and the center of shogunal power, throwing the political situation into even greater confusion.

*Subheading: The Causes of Friction Between the Two Parties of Opening and Expelling*
Indeed, Bitchu-no-kami's entry into the cabinet as senior member demonstrated the shogunate's determination to implement its convictions and should be seen as firing the first arrow of challenge against the daimyo who were then filled with anti-foreign sentiment.

Now, given this situation, since the shogunate could not possibly resist foreign pressure, the diplomatic negotiations they had initially idealized became increasingly difficult. In their desire solely for smooth diplomacy, they fell into circumstances that only intensified domestic turmoil. I think this too should be evaluated as something brought about by world trends.

*Subheading: Harris's Arrival*
What made the political situation even more difficult was the arrival of American Consul-General Harris. Harris arrived at Shimoda on July 21, Ansei 3, aboard the American warship San Jacinto, having of course received orders from his home country to reside in our nation. As I already mentioned in the previous chapter, the Japan-US Treaty of Peace and Amity of March, Ansei 1, contained provisions that if deemed necessary after eighteen months from signing, American officials could be stationed in our country following consultation between both nations. Following this precedent, we subsequently concluded similar treaties with Russia, as I have already discussed, but afterward this issue...

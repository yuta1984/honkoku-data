　　　　　　leaving no traces, but the 'Azuma Kagami,' which serves as an important historical record of the Kamakura shogunate from that period, has gaps in its account of this time.
　　　　　　From the record of Yoritomo staying at Hashimoto-juku on October 18th to the record of his arrival at Noma in Owari on the 25th,
　　　　　　the entries are completely missing, so what happened during that period is entirely unknown. However, since it records that on the 25th he stopped at Noma in Owari to pay respects at his father Yoshitomo's
　　　　　　grave, it appears he arrived at Noma one week after leaving Hashimoto. Therefore, based on the number of
　　　　　　days, it seems he must have stayed at Fumon-ji temple in Kunotani for a day or two, but there is no definitive proof of this, and there is no
　　　　　　need to investigate this matter further here. However, regarding his return journey in December, the 'Azuma Kagami' states:
　　　　　　　　　　"19th day, Kinoto-i, entered the night and was given lodging in the mountains of Miyaji"
　　　　　　Since he stayed in the Miyaji mountains, it can be inferred that from there he passed through Honnoガahara, emerged at Toyokawa-juku, and crossed the river upstream.
　　　　　　Later, regarding Shogun Yoritstune's journey to Kyoto in Katei 4, 2nd month (672 years ago), the same work records that he stayed at Toyokawa-juku on February 8th, and on October 19th of the same year, his return journey also records his arrival at the same lodging.
　　　　　　Thus during this period, travelers would emerge from Hashimoto at a somewhat upstream point of the Toyokawa River, reach Toyokawa-juku (present-day Furujuku), and pass through Honnoガahara. Haneda-no Okina's 'Mikawa Historical Sites Investigation' also records according to elderly accounts that the route went north from Akasaka over Sagisaka, through Yahata to emerge at Toyokawa-juku, then from the vicinity of present-day Sanmyō-ji through Tōgo, Wada, Kanada, Iwasaki, and others, over Yamasaka to emerge at Kunotani and reach Hashimoto.
《Interlinear note: Restoration of Tōkaidō Route}}　　　However, this new highway did not last long, and the route returned to the original Watazu road. There is a work called 'Tōkan Kikō' written by Minamoto no Chikayuki in Ninji 3 (620 years ago). In it, he writes that when passing by the lodging called Toyokawa, recently a new road called "Watazu no Ima-michi" (Watazu Present Road) had suddenly been created, and many travelers were taking that highway, so presently the residents of Toyokawa-juku were even planning to relocate their homes. From this we can see that already at that time, the highway had definitely been reopened toward Watazu. However, in the 'Azuma Kagami' entry for Kangen 4, 7th month (666 years ago), when the Grand Counselor Priest returned from Kamakura to Kyoto, it records that he stayed at Toyokawa on the 20th, so at this time he still took the old road. But when the Third Rank Prince went down to Kamakura in Kenchō 3, 3rd month (661 years ago), the same work suggests he definitely stayed at the new highway location of Watazu. Then in Kenji 3, in Abutsu-ni's 'Izayoi Nikki' (643 years ago), she writes: "The sun had completely set and it was so dark that one could not distinguish anything, when we lodged at a place called Wataudo or such." Thus by this time, the new highway route through Watazu was definitely being used actively. Now, was this second Watazu the same location as before? There are theories about this, and by this time the shallows of the Toyokawa had gradually changed and the topography had considerably altered. Dr. Yoshida's geographical dictionary states that the Ekika-gō (Post Station Village) of Hōi District in the 'Wamyōshō' refers to the vicinity of present-day Shimoji, and that the Watazu (Wataudo) in the 'Engi-shiki' is precisely this location. I believe this theory is probably correct. Originally, this Ekika-gō does not appear in the Kōzan-ji version of the 'Wamyōshō,' so Muraoka's 'Nihon Chishiryō' treats it as something that should be noted under Watazu-gō. This seems to align almost exactly with Yoshida's theory. Regarding this highway, though it is a much later work, the 'Musashino Michigusa' written by Hōgen in Genroku 12 provides quite useful reference material: "In ancient times there were separate roads called the 'two viewing roads' of Mikawa, though they eventually merged into one. Kamo no Chōmei appears to have gone from here via Honnoガahara to Toyokawa. Abutsu-ni appears to have gone from here via Watazu, crossing the Shigasuga ferry. Now one goes via Goyu to Yoshida." Thus the site of Toyohashi was on the main Tōkaidō line over a thousand years ago, but around Eikan (924 years ago) this changed to the Toyokawa-juku route, and from around Ninji (about 620 years ago) traffic returned to this route again. After the highway once again passed through here, the Toyohashi area gradually developed, and among the ancient villages of Akumi, Hada, and others, the place name "Imahashi" (Present Bridge) first arose.

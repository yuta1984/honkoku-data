were abundantly created at that time, most being words of fierce indignation and sorrowful anger. Mishima Chūshū also wrote in his preface to Kozan's Recent Manuscripts:

"The master's poetry in former times contained many words of fierce indignation and sorrowful anger, but compared to today's dignified and harmonious works, they seem almost like they came from a different person. This is probably not because the person is different, but because the times are different."

Now, what finally occurred was the Great Ansei Purge of the fifth year of Ansei (1858), year of the earth-horse, as I have gradually described before. At this time, the arrest of patriots in east and west continued in rapid succession - in the west, Umeda Unpin and Rai Mikizō, and in the east, Fujimori Kōan, Kusakabe Isaji, and Katsuno Toyosaku. All of these people were friends with whom Kozan had close relationships, so Kozan's friends were all deeply worried on his account.

Fortunately, at that time he had not yet encountered misfortune, but regarding this, since I had previously presented my personal opinion on page 483 that Kozan was probably also arrested on September 22nd of Ansei 5, I want to state here that this opinion was incorrect and make this correction.

Actually, I currently possess a letter that Fujimori Kōan sent to Kozan, and the box inscription is in Kozan's own hand, stating:

"I have had a long friendship with Master Kōan. Our correspondence was not limited to several dozen letters. The disaster of the earth-horse year swept everything away completely, and shortly afterward both the master and I encountered strange misfortune, separated east and west, and the master finally passed away. The surviving ink traces I possess are merely a few leaves."

Because of this, I temporarily thought as I mentioned before, but after gradually investigating further, I learned that Kozan's detention occurred entirely on October 19th of the following year, Ansei 6, and I recently heard from Master Teishū a poem that was said to have been composed at that time:

Two poems composed on the night of October 19th, year of earth-boar
"Having abandoned worldly affairs for just a few months / Among water and clouds I rejoiced in completing my leisure / What matter brought the urgent summons last night? / Domain officials detain me and do not permit my return"

"Thin quilts covering each other in the cold of the fifth watch / Unlike the peace of lying together by the hearth / Most pitiable of human affairs / Even wife and children learn to endure hardship"

This was naturally written while detained in Edo, and he was sent directly to this Yoshida afterward, departing Edo on October 23rd. As for the circumstances that led to this detention, I think the general outline can be understood from the previous "Biography of Master Kyōkyō," but not only were many of the people implicated in the Great Purge of the earth-horse year Kozan's friends, as I mentioned before, but Kozan had repeatedly presented memorials to senior councilors and other important officials, harshly criticizing current affairs, or composed poetry satirizing the times on many occasions, and he continued to appeal to the authorities about the injustices suffered by those caught up in this great purge.

Therefore, the domain felt it could not simply ignore the situation, and at the beginning of Ansei 6, the domain ordered him not to remain in the Edo metropolitan area. Consequently, Kozan had no choice but to travel to the Shin'etsu region, but it appears he faced considerable difficulties at this time. In his "Record of Leisure Hours," in the section on poetry about Mt. Kōzan, he wrote:

"In the year of earth-boar of Ansei, I traveled here. At that time, worldly debates were in turmoil, and people like us had no place to find refuge. We could only find refuge in poetry and wine, so I casually composed wandering verses to dispel my lingering worries and melancholy. Thinking of it now, I cannot help but laugh at myself."

I think this also helps us understand the situation of that time. However, since the circumstances of the time absolutely could not allow Kozan to be left alone, the domain summoned Kozan to the domain residence and detained him there, finally sending him to this Yoshida and temporarily confining him in a parlor prison.

Regarding the internal circumstances of this time, according to what a certain person learned, as I mentioned before, the senior councilor of the time, Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami, was the actual father of this Yoshida domain lord Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobuhisa, so there was private communication of intentions, and it is believed that the domain took action before Kozan could be captured by the shogunate. In other words, the fact that Kozan was able to preserve his life was the result of Nobuhisa's appropriate handling of the situation, as Nobuhisa himself was said to have stated later.

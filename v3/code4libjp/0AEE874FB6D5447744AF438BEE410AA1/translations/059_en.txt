In the records, this story is also recorded as involving Narisada, but I think the theory that it was Yasushige is more credible. According to this, it would be reasonable to consider that the origin of the horse standard lies with the Tanabe Makino family, and that family's tradition is also the same. Thereafter, Yasushige, to distinguish from those of the Tokugawa clan, modified the golden fan from the previous five ribs to seven ribs and used it as a standard, and it is still preserved in that family today. At the same time, I believe that the origin of what I mentioned earlier regarding Ieyasu's first donning of armor actually came from Narisada of the Nagaoka Makino family, and this too was accompanied by golden fans.

**The Genealogy of the Makino Clan at Ushikubo** I would like to mention a little about the genealogies of these two Makino families here. Originally, these two families, as I have repeatedly mentioned in previous chapters, descended from the Taira retainer Taguchi Shigeyoshi, so they are said to be of exactly the same lineage as the house of Makino Kohaku. However, there have long been unclear points about their origins, and both the Kan'ei Genealogies and the Kansei Revised Genealogies of Various Families record them as having different lineages. In particular, works like the Butoku Chronological Collection consider both Makino clans to have originally been the Maki clan, later changed to Makino, and thus naturally different in lineage from Kohaku's house. However, this theory is quite far-fetched and cannot be easily determined. In any case, I believe it is indisputable that the ancestor of all these families was Shigeyoshi, but as for who first came to Mikawa Province thereafter, there are differences in each family's traditions that require considerable research.

According to the Kansei Revised Genealogies of Various Families, in Kohaku's house, as I discussed in detail in the previous chapter, Shigeyoshi had a son named Noriyoshi, and his descendant Shigeyasu's son Shigekiyo lived in Sanuki Province for generations, but his son Shigetomi was the first to come to Mikawa Province, and he was Kohaku's father. The genealogy of the Tanabe Makino family is roughly the same, but the genealogy of the Nagaoka Makino family differs slightly in that Shigeyoshi's descendant Shigetomo was the first to come to Mikawa Province, but the lineage from Shigetomo to Narisada's father Ujikatsu is unclear. However, when examining the genealogies of these Nagaoka and Tanabe Makino families, they are not only quite detailed

but also appear to have considerable accumulated research from long ago. Particularly, the Nagaoka Makino family's "Record of Genealogical Categories" has accurate research and many reliable points. According to these sources, Shigetomo was Shigeyoshi's legitimate grandson and Noriyoshi's son. This means the Makino clan came to Mikawa Province quite early, and I believe this theory has real research value. This is because if Shigetomi, Kohaku's father, was the first to come to Mikawa Province, the proliferation of the Makino party during Kohaku's time would be excessively large, which I have always doubted.

Also, according to investigations by these two Makino families, there was one generation of a person named Narikata between Shigetomi, Kohaku's father, and Shigekiyo, and I think this may be correct. In essence, the Makino party originated from Makino village in Hoi District, later established themselves at Ushikubo, and among the prominent members of that clan, Kohaku built a castle at the present site of Toyohashi and moved there, while Ushikubo was initially guarded by the ancestors of the Nagaoka Makino family. However, the Toyohashi side temporarily fell to ruin as I mentioned before, but the Ushikubo side continued to the present day.

Next is the story of the Suganuma clan. As I mentioned before, the famous "three mountain families of Eastern Mikawa" were the Suganuma clan residing at Damine (also called Tamine), the Suganuma clan at Nagashino, and the Okudaira clan at Tsukude.

**Damine Suganuma, Nagashino Suganuma, Noda Suganuma** There is also an account in the "Chōya Kyūbun Hōkō" that includes the Suganuma clan of Noda, but since they were the same Suganuma clan family, such cases might have occurred. In any case, the Suganuma clan originated from Damine and then branched out to Nagashino, Noda, and other places.

The outline of their genealogy according to the Kansei Revised Genealogies of Various Families is as follows:

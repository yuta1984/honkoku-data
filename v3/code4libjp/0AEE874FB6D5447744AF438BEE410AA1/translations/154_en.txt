1. On the night of December 5th last year, over twenty travelers and local residents were crossing by ferry when strong winds blew them about ten chō upstream, creating a dangerous situation. They called out from the boat, and upon hearing this alarm, two rescue boats were dispatched from Funamachi to transfer the passengers. From the night of the 20th until the ninth hour of the 21st, the river water froze, ferry passage was poor, there was no horse crossing, and travelers faced great hardship.

2. Many of the rice fields and farmlands cultivated by Yoshida-juku residents are located across the river. There are difficulties when transporting harvested crops and fertilizer.

3. Regarding the post horses (one hundred horses) of Yoshida-juku and the wages of packhorse drivers from Teisuke, Daisuke and other villages: until last year they were employed at annual wages of 1 ryō, 1-2 bu each, but since the ferry crossing was established, with the hardship of loading and unloading cargo and entering cold water, this year's wages have been raised to 2 ryō to 2 ryō, 1-2 fun. Even with these wages, incompetent workers cannot load and unload cargo at the ferry landing, causing difficulties in employing packhorse drivers and servants.

4. Pawned goods brought from villages across the river to the post station face delays due to the inconvenience of ferry crossings, so people take them to other places across the river instead. As a result, the pawnshop business from across the river to Yoshida-juku has completely stopped, causing hardship.

5. Items like dried sardines and oil cake for fertilizer that people come to buy at the post station are now obtained from places across the river due to the inconvenience of ferry crossings, completely stopping commerce within the post station and causing distress.

6. Miscellaneous grains, firewood, dried leaves, fodder and other goods brought from villages across the river to the post station now incur ferry charges, making them more expensive than before. Firewood that previously cost about 100 sen now costs 140-150 sen. Although this post station holds twelve markets per month, since the ferry crossing began, market days have been disrupted, trade has declined, and the hardships of the post station are beyond description.

7. When fires break out in Yoshida-juku, people from villages across the river come to help, but since ferry crossings make passage difficult, their assistance is delayed, which we consider a hardship.

8. For travelers other than samurai families, ferry charges are 30 sen per pack load, 19 sen for loading/unloading cargo, and 12 sen for pedestrians, plus additional handling fees. This particularly burdens pilgrims and others of lower status, causing many to use the Honzaka route instead, further contributing to our post station's decline.

As stated in the above petition, if Yoshida-juku continues to rely entirely on ferry crossings, it will be completely ruined. If in your mercy you would restore the bridge as before, we would be most grateful.

Hōei 6, Year of the Tiger, March 2
                                        Mikawa Province Yoshida-juku
                                        Inn Keeper: Yoemon (seal)
                                        Elder: Yajiemon (seal)  
                                        Village Headman: Yojiemon (seal)
To the Honorable Magistrate

From this petition, it appears they completely abolished the bridge, but in fact in Hōei 6, an official named Maezawa Tōbē was dispatched from the shogunate to undertake bridge construction. From this, it seems the shogunate never intended from the beginning to completely abolish the bridge. Nevertheless, from the summer of the previous year they had already stopped traffic on the old bridge and changed to ferry service, then left it abandoned until March of the following year without beginning construction, which is why such petitions were submitted.

However, when repairs were to be undertaken again this time (Shōtoku 3), they again abolished temporary bridges and used ferries as before. The people of the post station were once again alarmed and immediately petitioned for temporary bridge construction, with village headman Asai Yojiemon of Funamachi and others signing jointly. At this time, Yoshida domain considered this most reasonable and made various earnest appeals to the shogunate. However, this matter was again not approved and ferry service was decided upon. No matter how they announced it, no contractors for the ferry service came forward, so the shogunate finally imposed the duty on Funamachi and Shimoji, requiring them to operate ferry service while collecting ferry fees, which greatly inconvenienced travelers.

This was because, as you know, since the Genroku era the shogunate's finances had gradually fallen into difficulty, and during Ienobu's reign this...

Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (The Imperial Title Incident and Nobuaki) 322

**Main Text:**
This incident is recorded in a book called "Taihei Hiroku" (Secret Records of Great Peace), but whether that account is accurate cannot be determined as there is no other evidence to corroborate it. However, it should not be dismissed as entirely fictional, and since it interestingly reveals Nobuaki's temperament, I shall relate it below.

The gist of that account is as follows: When Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobuaki was to travel to Kyoto for the change of Kyoto deputies, he also had the additional duty of entering the palace to request postponement of the imperial title matter. For this purpose, gifts were to be presented to both His Majesty and the Retired Emperor's palace. The shogunate council decided that red silk would be appropriate and ordered three grades from a textile merchant: supreme quality, high quality, and good quality. Since this was an era emphasizing frugality, they decided the middle grade (high quality) would be suitable. However, Nobuaki alone objected, saying: "Nothing in the realm should be more precious than what the shogun presents to His Sacred Majesty. If we use middle-grade items this time, then supreme quality goods would be completely unnecessary in the world. If I may be so bold, I believe frugality should be set aside in this matter." Consequently, it was decided to present the supreme quality items.

Regarding events after Nobuaki's arrival in Kyoto, when the actual transfer of deputy duties took place, Nobuaki took the superior position as the shogun's representative and declared in a loud voice: "Captains and guards, your diligent protection of this castle is commendable!" The account notes that according to precedent, he should have said "Your protection of this castle is most appreciated," but by deliberately omitting the polite language, though it might seem rude and arrogant, observers actually praised it as appropriately dignified for the shogun's representative. Nobuaki had other similar behaviors, as recorded in the essay "Kinoe-ne Yobanashi" (Rat Year Night Tales) written by Matsura Seizan, lord of Hirado in Hizen and great-great-great-grandfather of the current Count Matsura.

**Main Text:**
Once, when Nobuaki and fellow senior councilor Toda Une-no-shō were returning after paying respects at the Ueno mausoleum, they encountered the eldest son of a hatamoto retainer between the gates. This person prostrated himself completely on the ground in greeting. Une-no-shō lowered his hands to knee level in return, but Nobuaki passed by without even glancing at him. The protocol for someone of that status meeting senior councilors was to stop walking and bow while standing, but since this person had exceeded proper etiquette by prostrating himself, accepting such excessive deference would itself be improper. Observers praised Nobuaki's attitude as most admirable. This exemplifies the spirited character of Nobuaki's youth. As I mentioned before, this explains both why Sadanobu cautioned Nobuaki in his letters with "Your brilliance must not lead to carelessness," and also why he gave exceptional promotion and recommendation to the young Nobuaki.

Thus the Imperial Title Incident finally concluded with the house confinement of nobles Nakayama and Ōgimachi, but soon after, on the 23rd day of the 7th month of that year, Sadanobu finally resigned from his important position.

**Sadanobu's Retirement**

Sadanobu's departure from this crucial position as shogunal advisor came so suddenly that numerous theories arose about its cause. Dr. Mikami's book "Shirakawa Rakuō-kō and the Tokugawa Period" describes it as "perhaps an eternal mystery." However, the same book contains a passage from a letter Sadanobu sent to his relative Chancellor Takatsukasa Sukehira upon his resignation, which I believe is most instructive. Its main points were: "You must surely find this decision unexpected. However, I have served in office for many years now, and have undertaken considerable reforms. The nation's attention has increasingly focused on me alone. To remain in this weighty position coveting power would be presumptuous and inappropriate for the nation's welfare. Moreover, the shogun has now reached the prime of life...

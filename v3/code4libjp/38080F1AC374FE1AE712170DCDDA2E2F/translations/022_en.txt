appears to be the case, which somehow creates a pleasant feeling. As of April this year, there are 117 shrines within the city, including 2 prefectural shrines, 4 district shrines, 71 village shrines, and 40 unranked shrines. There are also a total of 126 temples, which by sect are: Soto Zen - 51 temples, Jodo - 29 temples, Nichiren - 3 temples, Shingon - 6 temples, Tendai - 1 temple, Rinzai Zen - 21 temples, plus one Jodo Shinshu Otani branch temple of Honganji, and other facilities including Shinto associations - 43 locations, Buddhist associations and preaching halls - 9 locations, and Christian churches - 6 locations. However, from the Akumi period, namely before the Kamakura period, notable shrines in Kambe (referring to the present Toyohashi area) include Shinmei Shrine (prefectural shrine) in Naka-hachimachi, Shinmei Shrine (district shrine) in Minatomachi from Haneda Mikuriya, and Shinmei Shrine (district shrine) in Higashida-machi from Haji Misono. Furthermore, shrines established during the Akumi period include eight shrines: Yoshida Shrine (prefectural shrine) in Sekiya-machi, Hachiman Shrine in Higashi-hachimachi, Hachiman Shrine (district shrine) in Hanada-machi, Shinmei Shrine (village shrine) in Iwasaki-machi, followed by Shinmei Shrine (village shrine) in Iwata-machi, Ankumi Kumano Shrine in Uo-machi, Hakusan-hime Shrine (village shrine) in Shinsen-machi, and Kurakake Shrine (village shrine) in Iwasaki-machi. Among temples, there were Saijiku-ji, Myotoku-ji, Shorin-ji, and others, but most have already fallen into ruin, and today only Shorin-ji remains with visible ruins. Speaking of the oldest architecture, there is the bell tower of Ryunen-ji built in Kanbun 2 (1662), followed by the worship hall of Tenjin Shrine in Shinsen-machi built in Enpo 2 (1674), then the main hall of Jingu-ji in Jokyo 2 (1685), the Kannon hall of Ryunen-ji in Genroku 2 (1689), the tower gate of Ryunen-ji in the same 6th year, the main hall of Goshin-ji in the 7th year, the tower gate of Jingu-ji in the 10th year, and the monks' quarters of Joen-ji at the end of that year. The main hall of Joen-ji is also said to be from before the Genroku era, but this is not clear. Additionally, the fire ritual hall of Jingu-ji was built in Kanei 20 (1643) and the bell tower of the branch temple in the 21st year, but all have undergone significant later repairs, with few parts retaining their original form, and there is almost nothing that could be considered pure art worthy of pride.

　　　　Social Welfare Projects
　Since the European war, world trends have undergone rapid changes, the momentum for social policy has suddenly risen, and no aspect of administration can ignore this issue. Social welfare investigation committees have been organized and research and implementation of various social facilities have begun. However, the scope of so-called social welfare projects is truly vast and diverse, and since we cannot immediately establish research facilities covering all areas, it appears we are gradually seeking to enhance them. The city is making rescue services for sick travelers, the poor, and military personnel, as well as disaster relief more complete than before, while also implementing personnel consultation, unemployment relief, neighborhood assimilation projects for the poor population surveys, and even free medical clinics, further advancing research in these related fields. Social welfare projects must all be based on facts. Exposing the current situation to prompt consideration by knowledgeable people is today's most urgent task. Since investigation and research of social conditions have not been given much importance in the past, great effort must be devoted to this area in the future. The number of those who fall behind due to defects in social organization shows a trend of sharp increase year by year along with the progress of material civilization, and many of them form groups, even creating so-called poor districts. Social diseases arise from this, and treating them not only meets the humanitarian demands of individual survival rights, but is also indispensable for social self-defense or social improvement, and must be a fundamental principle of urban improvement. In this sense, among the various project facility plans, the district commissioner office established within Toyohashi City Hall has achieved considerable results. Toyohashi City's Shinkawa Public Market, Matsuba Public Market, and public pawnshop have already opened and are performing remarkably. It would be desirable to begin construction of small housing and simple restaurants as social facilities.

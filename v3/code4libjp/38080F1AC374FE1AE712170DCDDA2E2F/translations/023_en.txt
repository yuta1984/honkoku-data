Particularly noteworthy is the assistance and supervision of relief facilities within the city. Categorizing the existing projects, the main ones are the Yurin Foundation in Higashida, which combines childcare guidance, child care, and personnel consultation, and the Toyohashi School for the Blind and Deaf, while the city's free lodging facility is also achieving good results. These should be based on thorough investigation of social phenomena and their causes, advancing in unison through coordinated organic organization, and fundamentally attempting improvement and advancement based on the concept of shared responsibility. In addition, three nurseries operated by the Toyohashi Regional Project Support Association and several other nurseries have been established.

Next, while it may not fall within the scope of social welfare projects, the Aichi National Defense Association Toyohashi Branch, Imperial Veterans Support Association Toyohashi Branch, Navy Association Toyohashi City Branch, Toyohashi City Home Front Service Association, Greater Japan National Defense Women's Association Toyohashi City Branch, and Aichi Prefecture Commercial and Industrial Organizations Home Front Support League Toyohashi Branch are providing comfort and support to soldiers and their families who risk their lives working for our nation.

In recent years, with the rapid population increase trend in Toyohashi City and adjacent towns and villages, along with commercial prosperity and industrial flourishing, and the development of industries that have created a momentum of vigorous growth throughout the city and village communities, traffic of people and vehicles and the distribution of goods have become increasingly busy. Therefore, the improvement of transportation facilities is indeed among the most urgent priorities. In view of these transportation conditions, the city authorities are earnestly planning improvements to various roads centered on Toyohashi City, connecting trunk lines and improving major roads linking important railway stations, while also planning road improvements necessary for regional development and frequently

conducting research and investigations to complete facilities that keep pace with the times. As a result of their utmost efforts to achieve these objectives, the first phase of a three-year continuous project starting from Showa 7 (1932), involving the construction of an overpass bridge and underground passage connecting the eastern commercial district with the western industrial district, has been completed. Furthermore, as a second phase project, several lines have been selected based on the aforementioned connecting roads to link with the port construction area, thereby connecting the suburban heavy industrial zone with important outer ring roads of the city to facilitate the distribution of goods. These will radiate from the city center while expanding the station square, which serves as the gateway to the city, and constructing or renovating other necessary routes to reform the city districts and ensure smooth operation of the transportation system. Important facilities in the northern and southern suburbs centered on the city are steadily progressing, and it is anticipated that these areas will experience dramatic development as commercial and industrial zones in the future, with the implementation of a major urban plan also being considered from a national defense perspective.

The water supply system was prepared through the city council on June 30, Taisho 15 (1926), and after 33 months from the groundbreaking ceremony on July 18, Showa 2 (1927), it was completed at a cost of over 2.6 million yen, with the water supply ceremony held on March 29, Showa 5 (1930). The outline of the construction uses underground water from the Toyokawa River that flows around the city as its source. A water collection conduit was built on the riverbed of the main stream at Shimo-jo, Nishimachi San-no-shita, leading to the pumping well at the waterworks on the riverbank. From there, water is sent through newly constructed transmission pipes and prefectural and municipal roads to the filtration pond at Kotakano, Tame-machi, located 33 cho to the southeast, where it becomes purified water. High-lift pumps at this location send the water to the distribution reservoir at the elevated water supply facility 80 ken east of the purification plant, from where it passes through a metering room and is distributed to the city's water supply areas by natural flow. Even when the future population reaches 160,000, this equipment will be able to provide water supply with the addition of transmission and distribution pipes and appropriate additional construction.

The topography of this city slopes from east to west, but the urban area generally belongs to low-lying areas, and within the city's urban districts there are rivers・

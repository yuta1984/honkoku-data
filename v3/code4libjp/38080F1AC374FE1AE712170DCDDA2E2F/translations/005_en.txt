　　　　History－Topography－Economic Power－Adjacent Towns and Villages－Other Statistics
　Toyohashi City was formerly called Yoshida-no-shuku and was famous as one of the fifty-three stations of the Tokaido. Though there are various theories, the folk song "When passing through Yoshida, they beckon from the second floor, with dappled silk-patterned long sleeves" is said to have originated from this place. In June of Meiji 2 (1869), it was renamed Toyohashi, and in Meiji 22 (1889) the autonomous system was first implemented, becoming a city under the city system in August of Meiji 39 (1906).
　When considering what the population might have been during the era when it was called Yoshida, since ancient times it was known as "Yoshida's twenty-four towns" and remained unchanged throughout the three hundred years of Tokugawa rule, the number of households also saw little increase or decrease. What was 1,000 households in Jokyo 5 became 1,011 households in Kansei 7, and 1,002 households in Kansei 10. Although there was a great earthquake in Kan'ei 4, prior to this period, which caused complete destruction of 210 households and partial destruction of 266 households out of a total of 1,011 households, with 11 deaths, it is a fact that the growth rate was extremely low. Consequently, the population also showed 5,545 people (men and women combined) in Koka 1, decreased by ten people the following year, and reached 5,519 people in Kaei 1. However, when the autonomous system was first implemented in Meiji 22, the current area of Toyohashi consisted of Toyohashi Town and Toyohashi Village

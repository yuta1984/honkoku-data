Rice fields - 432 cho (approximately 432 hectares), dry fields - 411 cho (approximately 411 hectares) before the merger, but immediately after the merger became rice fields - 3,083 cho (approximately 3,083 hectares), dry fields - 2,695 cho (approximately 2,695 hectares). As organizations for these, with the city agricultural association as the highest, there are sericulture unions, poultry purchasing and sales unions, and industrial cooperatives related to agriculture.

Now, what about the organizations in the commercial and industrial sectors? The Chamber of Commerce and Industry, fish market, vegetable market, cocoon market, dried cocoon exchange, Toyohashi branch office of the National Dried Cocoon Warehouse Federation, Toyohashi Rice Market of Japan Rice Corporation, retail market, and public market have been established, all continuing remarkable activities.

According to a survey at the end of June this year, the number of companies with head offices in the city is: joint stock companies - 126, limited companies - 1, unlimited partnerships - 53, limited partnerships - 244, totaling 424. When the activities of companies with head offices in the city are categorized by business type: mining 3 - capital of 3.06 million yen, manufacturing 126 - capital of 8.538 million yen, commerce 260 - capital of 9.650 million yen, transportation and warehousing 27 - capital of 15.186 million yen, others 7 - capital of 620,000 yen, total capital amount 38.914 million yen (paid-in capital 27.768 million yen). Needless to say, these companies bring great benefits directly and indirectly to Toyohashi's industrial world, but when observing the aforementioned situation, we still feel that capital activity in Toyohashi is quite weak, and we believe that we must devote research for the future of our business and industrial world.

Furthermore, the financial sector situation, which has a directly important relationship with this, is controlled by branch banks of Ono Bank, Aichi Bank, Nagoya Bank, Daiichi Bank, Japan Savings Bank, Fudo Savings Bank, Okazaki Savings Bank, and Aichi Prefectural Agricultural and Industrial Bank. In addition, there are several types of institutions such as credit unions, money lending businesses, pawnshops, and rotating credit associations that provide convenience for merchants, industrialists, and workers.

　　　History of Our Chamber of Commerce
　Our Chamber of Commerce was established on March 25, 1893 (Meiji 26), with its jurisdiction centered on Toyohashi Town in Atsumi District at the time, including eight towns and villages: Tahara Town in the same district, Toyohashi Village in the same district, Shimoji Town in Hoi District, Toyoaki Village in the same district, Ushikubo Town in the same district, Toyokawa Village in the same district, and Maeshiba Village in the same district. At the time of establishment, the office was located at 63 Banko in Oaza Fudagi of the same town, then moved to 150 Banko in Oaza Sekiya, and later in May 1902 (Meiji 35) moved to Hei 119 Banko in Oaza Kamidenmaba of the same town, changing the previous jurisdiction and also incorporating Hanada Village. It further moved to 137 Banko in Oaza Nishihachimachi of Toyohashi City on October 1, 1908 (Meiji 41), to Otsu 120 Banko in Oaza Nakashiba of the same city on February 15, 1915 (Taisho 4), to 29 Banchi in Oaza Honmachi of the same city on May 6, 1921 (Taisho 10), and to 45-5 Banchi in Ishizuka, Hanada-cho on October 2, 1926 (Taisho 15). However, as the city's development brought increasingly busy affairs and the long-pending new construction reached maturity, it was decided at the general meeting on January 28, 1928 (Showa 3) to construct a new building at 42-1 Banchi of the same district as a two-year continuing project with a construction cost of 60,000 yen. The ground-breaking ceremony was held on April 6, construction began on the 30th, completion was announced on October 9, and relocation took place on the 16th.

During this time, several transitions were repeated, and accordingly, changes in officers were frequently made.

The budget expenses for the recent five years are: 1936 (Showa 11) - 16,300 yen, 1937 (Showa 12) - 16,500 yen, 1938 (Showa 13) - 17,300 yen, 1939 (Showa 14) - 19,200 yen, 1940 (Showa 15) - 27,800 yen.

Furthermore, the changes in presidents and vice-presidents are as follows.

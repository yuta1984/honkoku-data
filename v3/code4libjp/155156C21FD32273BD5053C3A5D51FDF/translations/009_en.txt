Foreword
The Toyohashi City Planning was promulgated with the application of the City Planning Act on May 29, 1923 (Taisho 12), by Imperial Ordinance No. 276, together with Sapporo and 23 other cities. Since then, through the application of the Urban Building Act, determination of city planning areas, approval of street network plans, and designation of zoning systems, the first phase project approved by the Cabinet on March 30, 1933 (Showa 8) was completed in February 1936 (Showa 11), and approval for the second phase project has already been obtained. Here, we describe the progress of the previous phase and, excluding those materials collected in the first volume of Toyohashi City Planning Documents, we record the trends in city planning and the outline of the first phase project during the recent five years before and after the merger with adjacent towns and villages, thereby constituting this construction report.

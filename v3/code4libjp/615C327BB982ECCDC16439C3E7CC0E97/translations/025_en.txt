They retreated. Everyone wanted to retreat quickly as the enemy was close at hand, but he would not retreat. Finally, the lord father retreated first. Saburō-sama served as the rear guard. He was seventeen years of age. Everyone was deeply impressed.

1. When Taitokuin-sama appointed Shimada Danjō as town magistrate, he taught him: "Even those who have lost a court case and must commit seppuku - wait a while. Help them and discern good reasoning to save them," he said.

1. After Nakamura Shikibu-shōyū was there, there was a row of cherry trees along the moat at Suruga Castle. When Gongensama saw this, he said: "Shikibu-shōyū is inexperienced with such matters. If the moat side serves as a horse approach, it becomes convenient for enemy siege approaches. It would be better to install bamboo bundles and such. Moreover, the tree line provides the enemy with cover and convenience like bamboo bundles."

1. When Abe Bitchū, Takagi Mondo, and Inagaki Settsu-no-kami were appointed as permanent Osaka garrison commanders, Taitokuin-sama's intention was: "Abe Bitchū shall guard Ōte Gate, Mondo the Kyōbashi entrance, and Settsu-no-kami the Tamatsukuri entrance. Generally speaking, castle commanders appointed by Gongensama should have proper understanding. Throughout history, castles are taken by capture - even small castles are not taken by force through unreasonable direct assault. Especially Osaka and such places were built with strong fortifications. If these three entrances are well fortified and one or two hundred firearms are placed at Ōhashi Gate, it would be very difficult to capture by assault. Since the main keep has two entrances front and back, with both squad leaders and fifty guardsmen each, plus other internal personnel, even if the outer bailey is breached, the main keep alone could be defended for a hundred or two hundred days. Inexperienced men generally speak of assigning one or two men per arrow slit, saying there are insufficient personnel. In the end, when many troops are garrisoned in a castle, suspicions arise among everyone, which is harmful. If the gates are well fortified, the castle cannot be taken by assault. The greatest dangers in castle defense are three: strategic subversion, internal discord, and infiltration. First, strategic subversion involves using gold and silver through relatives, family connections, or close associates among those in the castle, promising any amount of rewards to act as guides and bring in [the enemy]. Internal discord refers to saying that certain people in the castle get along well or poorly with others..."

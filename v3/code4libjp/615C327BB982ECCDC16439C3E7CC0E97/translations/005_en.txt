He shot at the enemy with a matchlock at about three ken distance but missed. Lord Ieyasu observed this and taught him: "Kanshichi missed because he aimed and shot in the usual manner while his breathing had not settled after fleeing. When your breathing is unsettled, you should grip the stock with both hands in one bundle and shoot."

1. On the night of the defeat at Mikatagahara, thinking that if left as is, the enemy would either launch a night attack or continue their winning streak the next day, Ōkubo Shichirōuemon devised a plan and had all the matchlocks in the household collected. At dawn after the defeat, he gathered the barely twenty-four matchlocks that were available, led them around to Shō-ga-gake cliff, and had them fire three guns at a time toward Shingen's main camp. The enemy was greatly disturbed, and the next morning they withdrew from Mikatagahara, with Shingen reportedly saying, "Ieyasu's retainers appear to have many capable men. We cannot attack them carelessly." When this news reached Mikawa and the clan members said "This was Shichirōuemon's meritorious strategy," Tsunemoto immediately responded, "Shichirōuemon did well, but shouldn't we set fires within the clan's area? Set fire upwind!" Everyone who heard this praised it as "Indeed, a tactician's immediate judgment."

Shichirōuemon saw this from horseback and said, "If you take the hand to pull, he cannot be pulled. Take the feet and pull." So he took the feet and quickly pulled him away, preventing the enemy from taking his head, as Shinsuke later recounted.

1. At the same time, when Sagami was retreating on horseback, someone whose name I forget - some Shinjūrō-dono - became exhausted and near death, saying "Please let me ride on the horse behind you." When he was put on the horse, he clung tightly and they retreated with two people on the horse. The horse became extremely tired and they encountered great danger. Seeing this, the veteran warriors taught Jiuemon: "In such situations, no matter what is said, you must never let two people ride on one horse."

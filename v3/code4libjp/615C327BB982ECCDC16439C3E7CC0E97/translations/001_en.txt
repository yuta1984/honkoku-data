Tales of Mikawa

[The original text of "Tales of Mikawa" (designated as A) was written around the end of the Kan'ei era (circa 1645) by "a member of the Okubo clan" (whether it still exists is unknown)]

[A was (presumably) copied by Asakura Kagehira (1716-1735) (designated as B) and included in the collected works "Irō Monogatari" (Tales of Veterans, 1733, extant)]

[Furthermore, B was copied in 1803 by Doi Toshiyuki (1754-?), resulting in this book. The red annotations are thought to be by the book's former owner (given the reference to Doi Toshiyuki mentioned in frame 3, it might have been someone who knew him directly, but this remains unclear)]

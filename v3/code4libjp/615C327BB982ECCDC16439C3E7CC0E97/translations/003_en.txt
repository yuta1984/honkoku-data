Tales of Mikawa 《Note: A person named Riō says that there exists in the world a three-volume work called "Tales of Mikawa" said to be written by Ōkubo Hikozaemon. That book is a compilation of various events from the time when the Divine Ancestor (Tokugawa Ieyasu) resided in Sanshū (Mikawa Province) until the Genna era. This book is separate from that one and should not be confused with it【written in red ink】》

《Note: Horses for the battlefield》【written in red ink in the upper section】

1. According to the story told by Ōkubo Jihemon, horses suitable for riding in battle have been traditionally four sun three sun (possibly an error for four shaku three sun in height) and called "whip-responsive." First of all, large horses are inconvenient for mounting and dismounting while wearing armor. Whip-responsive horses that kick up, rear up, knead their rumps and eagerly want to go forward are splendid. Riding gentle horses in a restrained manner appears quite unsightly, he said.

1. According to the same person's story, during the provision of supplies to Ōdaka Castle, when they saw enemy forces positioned along the mountains, Naitō Jingozaemon, Shirōzaemon and all the others said there would surely be a battle. At that time, Sugiura Hachirōgo (Sugiura Masashige) said, "These are enemies with no intention of fighting. Pass through with peace of mind." When everyone later asked why he judged them to be enemies with no fighting spirit, he replied, "If they intended to fight, they would have stationed lookouts below near their banners. Since the mountain enemies did not come down, and the troops were merely straggling up the mountain, I knew they were enemies with no intention of fighting." As expected, there was no battle.

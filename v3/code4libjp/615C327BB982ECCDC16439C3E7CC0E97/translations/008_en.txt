thinks this way, as was recounted.

1. When various warrior tales were being told in the presence of Lord Jōshin Saburō, though the name is forgotten, when asked "Lord Jōshin, how many occasions of distinguished service have you had?", he replied "I have no particular recollection. Occasions involving the spear number twelve. Of these, eight times with my lord's spear alone, or through tactical advances and retreats, I saved many people." When he was recounting these occasions in detail, Sugiura Hachirōgorō, who was present, asked "At Takahashi Nawate, when you knocked down three enemy horsemen in mounted combat - that wasn't in the current story, but was that also among the twelve occasions?" He replied, "No, no, such small matters happen many times, so I do not mention them."

1. At the Battle of Anegawa, Saemon-no-jō was the first formation and Sakakibara Shikibu was the second. However, because the opposite bank of the Anegawa was high and the terrain difficult for horses to climb, when Saemon-no-jō went around slightly to attack, Shikibu of the second formation attacked without changing course, and with both the vanguard and second force attacking from both sides, the Asakura forces collapsed quickly. This is everyone's account.

1. At the same time, Nobunaga sent Fukutomi Heizaemon and Fukushima Heihachirō as messengers, and when they asked "Where is Ieyasu?", Torii Shirōzaemon came forward and asked "What business do you have?" They replied "We have matters regarding military tactics to convey according to his lordship's instructions." Shirōzaemon then said "We are serving as the vanguard, but Ieyasu's forces cannot function well if receiving orders from the main headquarters. Even if we fail, it would be one person's defeat and would not lead to total defeat."

When Saheiji asked "Where are you going?", Koheita explained the situation as above. Saheiji said, "What a pity - though you alone may be in a hurry, when you go on such a mission, you should stay until the arrest is completed, help with the capture, and then return to give your report."

Heiemon later told this story, saying it was about distinction achieved at Horikawa when [Shinjūrō] was sixteen years old.

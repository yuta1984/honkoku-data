"There is no need for such orders," he said roughly, so Heizaemon asked, "What is your name?" When he replied, "I am called Torii Shirōzaemon. I am a retainer of small standing who is not even counted among the eight in Ieyasu's inner circle," Heizaemon returned and reported this to Nobunaga exactly as it happened.

1. When Sakuma Uemon-no-jō came to reinforce Mikawa, before the Battle of Mimatagahara, when everyone was discussing military strategy, Torii Shirōzaemon said: "We cannot simply let enemies pass so close to the castle grounds.

So they immediately sent out scouts, and as expected, it was not breaking camp, as was recounted.

《Note: A general's awareness》【written in red ink in the upper section】

1. According to tales by Naruse Kichiuemon and Kusakabe Hyōuemon: "When in a besieged castle, the general's mindset is crucial. It is good to always position oneself in a high place visible from everywhere, making the troops think you are watching their movements from behind. If there is no high place, one should even position oneself on top of a building. If the general cannot be seen, all the men become careless and think only of deliberation," as the veteran retainers said, so it was recounted.

1. Similarly, it is advised that generals, as well as unit commanders, should not engage in whispered consultations or ear-to-ear conversations. The troops—

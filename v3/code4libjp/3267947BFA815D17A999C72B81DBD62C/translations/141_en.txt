Since there was no good way to come from there, recently many travelers suddenly began taking the route called the new road of Watazu, so now it is said that the inn has moved even people's residences elsewhere. The custom of abandoning the old and adopting the new is said to be a fixed principle, but I wonder what the reason could be - it seems uncertain. That the village people who have lived there since ancient times should now move their dwellings is regrettable, though this is not Fushimi village.

●Jinji Michi no Ki (Record of the Jinji Road)
　　How uncertain - what kind of person first began crossing these changing shallows of Yo River (Toyokawa)?

　　　　　　On the dawn of the 22nd day, going out in the deep night's
　　　　　　lingering moon's shadow, more sorrowful than ever　　Abutsu-ni
●Izayoi Nikki (Diary of the Sixteenth Night)
　Weary of dwelling, I left the moon capital, but my melancholy body cannot become accustomed to the lingering moon's shadow

　　　　　On the 14th day, departing from this lodging (which is Yahagi), there was a river
●Fuji Kikō　Wondering if this might be the crossing called Toyokawa　　Minister Fujiwara no Masayo
　Temporary pillow - how many more nights, and at Toyokawa, shall I hasten toward the end of the morning-rising waves?

○Nayose
○Fuboku Volume 24, External　　　　　Kamo no Chōmei
　The wind crosses, the floating bridge of dreams is severed, and even my sleeves are deep with Toyokawa's waters

　●Upon examination, this poem does not appear in printed editions of Chōmei's poetry collections.
　●According to Haku, Toyokawa-dera refers to Sanmyōji Temple. The "floating bridge of dreams" refers to the bridge in front of Benzaiten.
　　The Sōgi Kikō contains various matters, but I omit them here.

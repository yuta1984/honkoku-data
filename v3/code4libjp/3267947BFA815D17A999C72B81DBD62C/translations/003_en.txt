A Study of the Districts and Villages of Mikawa Province as Listed in the Wamyō Ruijushō by the Mitsui Family

General Overview

The most revered Mimusubi no Ōkami and other deities, observing from heaven above, commanded that this floating land be repaired and solidified. In accordance with that imperial command, the two great deities Izanagi and Izanami gave birth to the land, and the two great deities Ōnamochi and Sukunahikona planted reeds and sedges to create and solidify it, completing what came to be called the Great Eight Islands. However, later it was divided into many parts.

This is first recorded in the Nihon Shoki (Volume 7, page 26), where in the fifth year of Emperor Seimu's reign, in the ninth month of autumn, it states: "Using mountains and rivers as boundaries, the provinces and districts were divided, and villages were established according to the north-south and east-west roads. Thus, east-west was designated as 'vertical' and north-south as 'horizontal.' The southern side of mountains was called the 'sunny side,' and the northern side of mountains was called the 'shady side.'"

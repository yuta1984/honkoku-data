○Sakushima (Saku Island)　　●According to "Mikawa Moshiogusa," it belongs to Hazu District and is one of three islands in the sea between Sesshū (Ise), Bishū (Owari), and Sanshū (Mikawa). ●According to research, it is located about one ri south of Miyasaki village in the same district, on the sea. The island measures twenty-one chō in length and three chō in width, with two villages.
　　　●The "three islands of three provinces" are: Himaka Island belongs to Owari, Shino Island belongs to Ise, and
　　　　Landing a boat at a place called Sakushima and lodging at a small hermitage called Itokuan, I observed the mountain and water scenery was magnificent, truly presenting the lonely atmosphere of a mountain dwelling.

　　　Even in this way, one can live in this world—shall I drink without even waiting for the mountain spring's drops?
　　●According to research, there is currently no temple by that name on Sakushima. It is said there is an "Itoku-ji" temple on Shino Island. If so, perhaps he mistook Shino Island for Sakushima—this should be investigated.

○Ōhama (Great Beach)　　●Located in Hekikai District.
　　　●According to "Mikawa Moshiogusa," in this village there is an ancient temple of the Ji sect called Shōmyō-ji. This is probably what is being referred to.

　●"Kantō Kaidō-ki"　　　　　　　　　　　Minister Fujiwara no Masayo
　　　Though I thought I could not part the wave-path of Ōhama, quickly I have moored my boat at that shore
　　　　Tonight spending the night aboard the ship, with the boatmen passing back and forth over my pillow all night, I continue my thoughts in verse
　●Same author
　　　Not at Namba Bay, but on another ship route, under the fishermen's feet I spent one night

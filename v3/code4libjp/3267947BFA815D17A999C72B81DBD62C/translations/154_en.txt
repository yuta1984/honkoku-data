○Irago Cape (Irago-saki)
●Irago village in Atsumi district is at the southwestern extremity of this province,
●"Azuma Kagami" volume 16, folio 4 "Daijingū Imperial Shrine Lands, Irago Imperial Kitchen in Mikawa Province," ●"Shinpō-shō" also lists Irago Imperial Kitchen in the Outer Shrine's land registry, ●"Kokunai Jinmyōchō" states "The Great Deity Iraku of Senior Third Rank resides in Atsumi district,"

●Because the preface to this place in "Man'yōshū" volume 1 states "Ise Province," some have mistakenly recorded it as being in Ise Province,
●This is seen in "Yakumo Gyoshō" volume 5, folios 34 and 36 "Irako-ga-shima (Ise Man'yōshū)" and "Kiyosuke-shō" "Mikawa kakari (Matsu)," and also in ●"Kokon Chomon-jū" volume 12, folio 17: "An archery expert called Shōjōza, when he was young, crossed from Mikawa Province to Kumano, and encountered pirates near Irako in Ise Province, etc." - these are similar cases.

●Also, "Matsuba-shū" records Irago Island as being in Shima, ●"Moshio-gusa" volume 5, folio 33 also lists it as Shima district in Shima Province,
●"Nihongi Tsūshō" volume 35, folio 17 states: Seki's "Bun'iki Shishōzu" says: Upon consideration, "Shoku Nihongi" records that Shima Province's Tōshi district was divided to establish Saei district for the first time. This district has now perished, Irago Cape preserves its name in Mikawa, Nishiki Island is attached to Ise, and many other famous places are mixed into Ise and Kii. Some say that Shima was originally between Ise and Mikawa, but after long ages was submerged by seawater, and later the eastern part of Ise was divided off to form one province.

○"Shiyō Shiryaku" states: Irago Cape is in Irago village, this land is in Atsumi district of Mikawa Province, this place is one ri from Kamishima, and because it is close, it is confused with Shima Province, etc.

●"Man'yōshū" volume 1　A poem composed by Kakinomoto no Asomi Hitomaro while remaining in the capital during the imperial progress to Ise Province

In the tide's roar, at Irago's shore, on a rowing boat, does my beloved ride? around the rough island cape,

●This poem in "Hitomaru-shū" reads "In the tide's roar at Itsushi bay on a rowing boat does my beloved ride on the rough shore"
●"Fuboku-shū" volume 23, Miscellaneous 5 has "In the tide's roar to Irago island the rowing boat does my beloved ride through the rough island straits"

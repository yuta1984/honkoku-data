●"Azuma Kagami" volume 16, folio 4 "Daijingū Imperial Shrine Lands in Mikawa Province" same, ●"Shinpō-shō"
●"Meisho Hōgaku-shō" (printed edition, folio 60) says: the location of Warahahe-no-ura is unclear, said to be around Oitsu-shima, but this location is also unknown, ●"Mikawa Moshio-gusa" says: it is an island of small pine groves growing in clusters along the seashore of Ōtsu village and Ōsaki village in Atsumi district. Upon consideration, now there are land boundary disputes - the area facing Ōsaki village is called Ōsaki-shima, and the area facing Ōtsu village is called Ōtsu-shima, but all are the ancient Oitsu-shima. Warahahe-no-ura is said to be near Oitsu-shima, entering at Tate-eguchi.
●"Futaba-matsu" says: at the foot of Kasashima in Atsumi district, now called Ura village, Oitsu-shima refers to the cape continuing from Ura village, ●"Moshio-gusa" volume 5, folio 38 "Mikawa"

Facing the cape called Oitsu-shima in Mikawa Sea (Mikawa Bay), composing about the charming inlet called Warahahe-no-ura

Oitsu-shima - does the island-guarding deity encourage? The waves are gentle at Warahahe-no-ura

●Upon consideration, in "Utamakura Nayose" volume 19, Mikawa section, it lists Oitsu-shima and Warahahe-no-ura (same as Okitsu-shima in Gōshū), and records this poem, stating "The above refers to composing about the charming inlet called Warahahe-no-ura at the cape called Oitsu-shima in Mikawa" according to the personal collection, ●In "Matsuba-shū" volume 3, it says Warahahe-no-ura is in Ōmi's "Nayose," with the preface stating "in Mitsu Sea, etc." ●Also, in variant editions of the personal collection it says "in the lake." One should carefully consider whether "mitsu" was mistaken for "Mikawa," or "Mikawa" was mistaken for "mitsu."

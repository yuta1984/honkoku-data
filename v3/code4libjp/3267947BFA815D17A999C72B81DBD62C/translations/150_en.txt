○Midorino Pond (Midorinono-ike)　　●"Matsuba-shū" lists it as Mikawa, "Fuboku-shū" says it's in this province　●"Aki no nezame"　●"Ruijū meisho gaishū"　etc. all list it as being in this province
　　　　　　　　●According to "Mikawa Moshio-gusa," it is located within Awaji village, Hekikai district, commonly called
　　　Sagi-gusa Pond, northwest of Utō village on the Tōkaidō road. It gets this alternate name because sagi-gusa (heron grass) grows in this pond.
　　●According to "Futaba-matsu," some say it's Iwahori Pond, but this is unclear. ●According to "Sanpo-matsu," it's also called Hishi Pond, or the pond of Awaji village. According to Haku, it might be in the vicinity of Osakai.
　　●In my opinion, to the east of the river in Miwatari village, Yana district, there is something called Gongen Mountain, and to its north there is a small field.
　　　In the rice fields around there is a small mound with the place name Midori Mound, where a single zelkova tree stands.
　　　According to the villagers' explanation, long ago when an official came here to survey the rice fields,
　　　beyond here were deep fields with embankments, making it difficult to survey the ridge-steps, so he said to make it "midori" (rough estimate), and thus
　　　it got this name. However, this is a corrupted explanation by later people. Midori Mound is a remnant of the ancient name for Midori Field, and Midono is clearly an abbreviation of Midorino. This is evident because the "Wamyō-shō"
　　　reads the district name Midorino in Kōzuke Province as "Mitono," and the margin notes in "Minbu-shiki" volume 22, page 2, and "Shūgai-shō" volume 4,
　　　page 62 also read it as Midono, so there is no doubt that Mitarino is Midorino.

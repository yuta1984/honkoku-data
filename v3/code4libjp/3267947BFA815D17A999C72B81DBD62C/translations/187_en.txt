○Ōiwa (Great Rock)　　●According to "Mikawa Suzume," this was formerly two villages called Karasawa, but became the single village of Ōiwa in medieval times. It is located in Atsumi District.
　　　　　　　On the 15th day, passing by the foot of a mountain called Ōiwa-yama, I saw an old temple. The principal deity was said to be Fumon Jigen Daishi (Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva), so I offered dharma donations for a while.
　●"Fuji Kikō"　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Gyōkō Hōshi
　　　May your reign last until the countless pebbles all become the great rock mountain

○Futagawa (Two Rivers)　　●This is a post station in Atsumi District. ●According to "Segen Benryaku" (Volume 2, folio 24), it is at the edge of Mikawa, and because Ōiwa and this place are adjacent, it is called Futagawa (Two Rivers).
　○Travel Record　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Kobori Sōho
　　　The province is Mikawa, the village is Futagawa; combining them, when shall I return to reach my hometown?
　○　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Minister Karasumaru Mitsuhiro
　　　Like a jeweled comb box, as today's dawn breaks over Futagawa, this too I hear is within Mikawa
　　●In "Fuboku-shū" (Volume 24): "In which rapids should the flowing tears stop? Crossing the barrier of Futagawa" by Saigyō
　　●In "Aki no Nezame" it says "not yet verified"—this should be investigated. (There are also other unverified references)

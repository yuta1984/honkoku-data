Those who are skilled and capable but not versed in writing and arithmetic should be appointed as Shusai (administrators) and Suchō (clerks).

○According to the Genmei Tennō-ki (Volume 6, folio 4), in the fifth month of Wadō 6 (713), it was decreed: "The senior and junior heads of district offices serve for life, not as rotating appointments," etc. ○In the Ruiju Kokushi (Volume 29, Shinji 19), an edict from the third month of Enryaku 17 (798) states: "Long ago, the Naniwa court first established the various districts. Accordingly, those with merit were selected and appointed as district heads. Their descendants inherited the positions and served permanently in those offices," etc. Similar records appear in Itsu-shi, Volume 7, folio 4.

○Thus, while government officials appointed from the capital served four-year terms before being replaced, district officials were appointed from local residents and served for life without rotation.

○The classification of provinces into dai (great), jō (superior), chū (middle), and ge (inferior) categories appears in the Shokuin-ryō and other sources, with references in the Shoku Nihongi (Volume 16, folio 10). However, the Minbu-shiki was the first to record all 68 provinces. Later works like Shūgai-shō (Volume 4) and Shokigen-shō (Volume 4) also contain such records.

○The Sōke Kango-shō, quoting the Ryō-ritsu, states: "A territory of 150 ri square constitutes a great province, 100 ri square constitutes a superior province, 80 ri square constitutes a middle province, and 50 ri square constitutes an inferior province."

○The Minbu-shiki (Volume 22, folio 2) designates "Mikawa Province as superior," which, as mentioned above, means it was classified as a superior province. ○Regarding Kamo no Sukeyuki-gō...

The Daihachishū-ki (Volume 6, folio 19) states in its section on this province: "It is said that there are many mountains and rivers, but they are shallow, only one shaku deep. Therefore, the five grains do not ripen. The province is poor and ranks as an inferior small province." It is unclear from which source this derives.

○While such was the imperial system in ancient times, after Kamakura no Ni-i Yoritomo defeated the Taira clan and was appointed as Sō-tsuibushi (Chief Constable), he placed shugo (military governors) in each province and jitō (stewards) in each district to administer affairs. Gradually, the authority of provincial governors and estate holders weakened. Moreover, as turbulent times continued and military houses exercised power at will, eventually even the appointment of provincial governors ceased, and the old system collapsed, leading to the present state of affairs. However, that it naturally reverted to a feudal system resembling ancient times may also be according to divine will.

The kokufu (provincial capital) refers to the place where the provincial governor established his residence upon arriving in the province. In every province, it was located at the center of that province and was also called fu or fuchū.

○The Jūseki In'e states: "Under the Tang system, a great prefecture was called fu, and military guards were called fu."

Nihon Kanoko (Volume 6, folio 6): "Inferior provinces: one and a half days square"
Shiojiri states: "The provincial capital is also called kokuya. According to Sesetsu: 'In recent times, it is commonly called fu, meaning the public office. This is the same as the ancient public court.' This being the case, it is the same thing with no disagreement."

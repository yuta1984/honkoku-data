Dedicating his heart to the way of the imperial gods, while reading through these ancient books, he extracted over four hundred poems from records of poetry and literature, and wrote alongside them rare and beautiful scholarly explanations that shine like dew on bamboo grass. He named this work "Kokaō Meiseki-kō" (Study of Ancient Poems and Famous Sites) and created it as a guide for those who compose poetry - this was earnest work, like beans crawling along the ridges of rice fields. Originally, places called famous sites in the distant past when pine winds echoed, like white birch bows, are now unclear in this world, like dawn clouds reflecting in the sky, and the destinations of horses heading toward one's birthplace are difficult to know well, so that everyone seems to cross dark mountain paths in darkness. Like a favorable tailwind for ships crossing the great sea, the joy of this book being completed in this way is so great that I write down these overflowing words, protruding like the jutting rocks of Sashide-no-iso.

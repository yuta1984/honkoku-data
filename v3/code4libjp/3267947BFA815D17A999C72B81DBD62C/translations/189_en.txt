○Washizuka (Eagle Mound)　　●Located in Hekikai District

　　　　　　　　A certain abbot of Shōmyō-ji temple in Ōhama saw me off to this village, so I composed this poem
　○"Kikō" (Travel Record)　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sōboku
　　　Seeing you off today, this parting feels like the beach of Uchide where I stopped my horse
　　　　　　　　Reply from Shōmyō-ji temple
　○Same
　　　Since Ōsaka Mountain is far from where I meet you today, I wish there were a barrier guard on this parting road


○Hoshigoe (Star Crossing)　　●Located in Hōi District.
　　　　　　●According to "Mikawa Moshiogusa," it is a small mountain pass at the border between Mitani village in Miyō township and Ōtsuka village.

　○"Kikō" (Travel Record)　　　Leaving the lodging of Nishigōri Tōsuke　　　　Sōboku
　　　In travel lodging where I parted as people gradually disappeared, how the lingering feelings must remain—this Hoshigoe of old age
　○Same　　　　　Also　　　　　　　　　　　Same author
　　　Turning back, wanting to meet again at Hoshigoe—what an endlessly captivating slope of old age this is

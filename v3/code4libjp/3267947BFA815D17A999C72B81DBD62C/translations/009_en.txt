This is the official road. Although there should have been a provincial name "Kamo," it is said that based on the river flowing through Kamo District, it came to be called Mikawa (御川) Province. 《Interlinear note: There are many unbelievable things among these. Here we extract and cite only the essential points.》

○ In Saitō Hikomaru's "Consideration of Provincial Name Origins," he also quotes the above Fudoki text, and Nobutomo says: "Now in Tōtōmi there is a village called Futagawa that sounds quite similar. Hikomaru thinks that naming a province after three great rivers is rare, but on further thought, rather than seeking salvation, perhaps it was simply named Mikawa to praise the great river." 

○ Incidentally, the "Suga Seikō-ki" cited in "Futaba-matsu" refers to what is stated in "Jinten Ainō-shō" 《Interlinear note: Volume 2, folio 7》: "In Owari Province there is a river called Totogawa. According to the 'Suga Seikō-ki': When Ōnamuchi and Sukunahikona made their provincial tour, these were the traces of their going and coming footsteps, hence called 'toto' (traces). The commentary says: Commonly, traces are called 'toto.'" Therefore, "toto" should be the name for footprints.

This likely derives from this text.

○ This refers to the time described in the Kojiki 《Interlinear note: Volume 1, folios 4-5》: "The two deities Ōnamuji and Sukunabikona worked together to create and solidify this land," and also in the "Ōmiwa Chinza Shidai-ki": "Initially, the two deities Izanagi and Izanami together gave birth to the Great Eight Islands and various small islands, and when the land was young and floating and drifting like jellyfish, Ōnamuchi-no-mikoto and Sukunahikona-no-mikoto joined forces and united their hearts to plant reeds, rushes, and sedges, solidifying and creating the land. Therefore, he is called Kunizukuri Ōnamuchi-no-mikoto. Hence it is called Ashihara-no-kuni (Reed Plain Land)." The Iyo-no-kuni Fudoki states: "Regarding Yu District, when Ōnamochi-no-mikoto felt shame and regret, he bathed Sukunabikona-no-mikoto, who shortly revived and sang 'Truly, I have slept for a while,' then stepped vigorously, and the place where he walked still remains on the stones in the hot springs." This too shows that such traces remain.

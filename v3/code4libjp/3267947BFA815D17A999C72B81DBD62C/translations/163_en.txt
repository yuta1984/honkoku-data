This is clear evidence that it also referred to the area around Hiuchi Slope.
●In Genpei Jōsuiki (Volume 45, Section 20), in the passage about Minister Taira no Munemori's journey to the Kantō region, it states: "Having also passed Takashi Mountain,
　　he arrived at Hashimoto post station in Tōtōmi." This, together with the preceding text stating "Having also passed Futamura Mountain, he crossed
　　Yatsuhashi in Mikawa Province," shows that it refers to places within Mikawa Province.
●Also in the same work (Volume 27, Folio 4), in the section on the Battle of Yabashi River, it states: "The rear guard reached Hashimoto post station at Mitsuke provincial government office. The nearby
　　Takashi and Futamura appear to have no gaps for soldiers in field or mountain." This also mentions Hashimoto post station
　　and describes it as "nearby," proving it was not continuous with Hashimoto.
●In Lord Fujiwara no Masayo's Fuji Travel Record from Eikyō 4, it appears as "Takashi Mountain, said to be
　　around this area," and includes the poem:
　　　〽"Only the name, not reaching Fuji's base - Takashi Mountain, what appears high must be merely foothills"
　　"On the 15th day, at Shiomi Slope in Tōtōmi Province..." This also has preceding text stating "At Yatsuhashi in Mikawa Province...,
　　on the 14th day, departing from this lodging place (referring to Yahagi)..." before mentioning Shiomi Slope in Tōtōmi Province,
　　making it clear this refers to places within our province.
●In Lord Fujiwara no Masakō's Kantō Kaidō Record from Meiō 8, it states: "On the 25th day, bringing the ship to
　　a place called Saku Island..., on the 28th day, when we departed by ship, looking toward the right side, at what they call Takashi Mountain,
　　we saw not really a mountain but hills stretching far into the distance:
　　　〽'Since ancient times only the name - Takashi Mountain, where is the base, with no peak to speak of'"
　　This clearly seems to refer to the flat mountains around present-day Takashi Village.
　　This is further confirmed by the following passage: "On the 1st day of the 6th month, departing from Imahashi village (referring to present-day Yoshida post station)..."
　　making it increasingly clear.
　　All of these are reliable evidence of locations within Mikawa Province.
●Also in the Kaidō Record from Jōō 2 (this is what is commonly called Kamo no Chōmei's Kaidō Record), departing from Toyokawa, with fields darkening and villages darkening

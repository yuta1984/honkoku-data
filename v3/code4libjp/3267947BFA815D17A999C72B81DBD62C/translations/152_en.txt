the belly [of the mountain] is called Mineno-hara (according to "Sanpo-matsu" as well). It's a place where Irago can also be seen well, but it is within Tōtōmi Province.
　This must be it.
　　Departing from Toyokawa, passing through village dusk and countryside dusk, traveling far and wide, there is a place
　　called Mineno-hara. Emerging from the dew of Hino grass, not climbing to young tree branches, clouds clear
　　in the pine wind of the peaks, and the mountain colors are dyed as one with heaven. The emotions of distant viewing are inexhaustible.
●"Jōō Kaidō-ki"
　　The mountain edge is buried there deeper than dew, and dawn breaks over the grass at the field's end
　　　Soon reaching Mount Takashi, and so forth

●"Fuboku-shū" volume 31, miscellaneous 13, "Bandai-shū"　Mineno village　　　Hafuri-be Narushige
　　Who now would recall the eastern road and the evening sky of Mineno village

○"Nayose"　　　　　　　　　　　　　Kamo no Chōmei
　　Going this morning through Mineno plain where quail cry, cranes call across at Cape Irago
　　●This poem is recorded in "Matsuba-shū" volume 13, stating that when passing through a place called Mineno in Mikawa Province,
　　he composed about cranes crying toward Irago, it says.

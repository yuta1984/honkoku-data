was renamed Goyu, while Shimo-Goi remains unchanged to this day. According to popular sayings and abbreviations, in ancient times oil was presented from this place to Prince Kusakabe's temporary palace (the Tōsōkō states it was Empress Jitō's temporary palace), hence it became the post station name in later generations - though one wonders about this account.

Tōkan-ki, Zen Master Takuan:
Though Ōgoi is not definitively fixed, there is a fixed rule
The transience of wind upon life's dewdrop

Tōkō Wasetsu, Junior Second Rank Yasukuni:
As for courtesans, in complete reverse falsehood
Do not be fooled by today's appearance

●Mikawa: These are the Mitsu River and Otowa River. Their lower reaches are called Gosho River, and in that vicinity there is a place called Gosho-miya and such, making it clear that this entire area has ancient noble associations in its place names.

Man'yōshū, Kasuga:
The depths and shallows of Mikawa do not fall, so piercing
My sleeves became wet, but there is no help for it

Personal Collection, Minbu-kyō Ieka:
The Mikawa that crosses the rocky rapids of the waterfall
Washes my pillow in the dawn dream

●Vicinity of Goyu Station: Though it bears the name Goyu Station, it is actually located in Ōaza Nishikata, Mitsu Village, and there are quite a few scenic spots for sightseeing in this vicinity. One should mention Mitsu Shrine, Mount Daion-ji, the Shingu-yama Memorial Monument, and Sazanami Seaside Bathing Beach. Considering that in ancient times the area around Goyu Station was an inlet sea, the so-called blue sea transformed into rice fields, the frequent mentions in old records of Mitsu-no-shō or Mitsu Seven Villages, Mitsu Sea, Mitsu Port, etc., are sufficient to prove this. When historical records state that in the fifty-fifth year of Emperor Keikō's reign, in the eighth month, the imperial carriage went to Ise and then entered the Tōkaidō route, this probably refers to entering this port.

○Mitsu Shrine: Can be reached about three chō from Goyu Station. This shrine is said to be of very ancient foundation, and there is a waka poem transmitted as a divine composition:
Ōshima ya, chiyo no matsuhara ishidatami
Even if the stone pavement crumbles away, I will protect it

Mount Daion-ji is only a few dozen paces from the shrine. The thickly wooded mountain you see directly ahead to the north from the train window is precisely this mountain. The scenery is worth admiring.

○Shingu-yama Memorial Monument: Can be reached about one chō from Mitsu Shrine. A memorial monument for fallen soldiers of the Sino-Japanese War of Meiji 27-28 was erected here. The mountain is not high, the trees are abundant, and the view is excellent.

○Sea Bathing: About five chō south of the station, the coastal tide is shallow, suitable for fishing sharks and collecting shells. Recently, borrowing the coastal imperial forest land, the proprietor of Toyohashi's Chitose-rō has newly established the "Sazanami" seaside bathing facility. In summer, bathers gather in crowds.

●Kokufu and Akasaka: The ancient provincial capital and Akasaka were places we cannot imagine today, quite prosperous indeed. But now they exist almost in name only, with barely the town names remaining. One must say the changes of time are indeed extreme.

●Brief Biography of Ōe no Sadamoto Ason (Rikiju-hime)
Former Governor of Mikawa, Ōe no Sadamoto, Buddhist monk Jakushō, was a descendant of Emperor Heizei and the third son of Remonstrating Councilor Ōe no Itsumitsu Ason. He early inherited the ancestral profession, received noble rank, and became Governor of Mikawa. He excelled in literature and was skilled in calligraphy. However, by nature he loved hunting and lived in leisurely self-indulgence, so everyone doubted his capabilities. During Emperor Ichijō's reign, he was appointed as governor of this province. At that time, the Akasaka wealthy man Miyaji Yatarō Nagatomi had one daughter named Rikiju-hime, who was deeply...

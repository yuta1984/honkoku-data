behind it, the view is beyond description. Particularly, the frost-touched leaves across the entire mountain ridge are more crimson than flowers, so in late autumn, people come from far and near to appreciate the scenery, their footsteps following one another. This is truly a famous scenic spot of Eastern Mikawa. It is also said that when Grand Minister Moronaga of the Myōon-in was exiled to Idota in Owari Province, he entered this mountain to console himself in the tedium of his place of exile and enjoyed viewing the autumn colors of the trees. In ancient times, it seems to have been famous for wisteria and autumn leaves.

Gosen-shū, Anonymous
Looking toward the cloudy heights where you dwell, Mount Miyaji—
I would cross over, not knowing the way

Kashū, Kawachi no Ason Mitsune
Composed when the son-in-law of the Governor of Mikawa was given a horse at the house of the Left Captain of Cavalry
For what reason, though not distant, Mount Miyaji—
Make it an offering, my lord, for crossing over

Fuboku-shū, Priest Zōki
What I saw as purple clouds was Mount Miyaji—
The famous wisteria blooming there

Awabi-tama-shū, Nakayama Biseki
Priceless is the brocade of Mount Miyaji—
What could one buy with it at Yahagi market?

Kashū, Lord Tameie
In the morning mist of Miyaji's fields touched by sunlight—
To whom does the path I once served lead?

Heishin Kikō, Hayashi Dōshun
If former kings wished to comfort the people's lives, surely there would be those welcoming with wine jars and simple food
Regrettably, at this imperial hunting ground site, we have not heard the name of the temporary palace

●Chōfuku-ji and Shōbō-ji Located in Nishiura, Akasaka Town. During the reign of Emperor Ichijō, Miyaji Chōtomi, a wealthy man of this province, grieved the death of his daughter Rikiju and built a temple, naming it Chōtomi-ji. Later it suffered fire damage and became a ruined temple, but in Daiei 2, the priest Zen'yo-in built temple buildings on the site of the Miyaji family residence and renamed it Chōfuku-ji. It belongs to the Jōdo sect as a branch temple of Kyoto's Chion-in. Shōbō-ji is also located in the same place, belonging to the Jōdo Shinshū Ōtani sect and called Taishi-zan. During the reign of Empress Suiko, when Prince Shōtoku was traveling to teach throughout the provinces, he came to this place and carved a wooden statue himself, enshrining it in a grass hut, which became the founding. Later there were many changes, and Nōen, the eldest son of Minamoto no Noriyori, took the name Ryōshin-bō and became the restorer.

●Kokubunji and Saimyō-ji Located in Yahata, Hirahata Village, more than ten chō northeast of Kokufu Town. This was formerly one of the provincial temples (kokubunji). Now it has fallen into ruin and belongs as a branch temple to Saimyō-ji. Ancient roof tile fragments are found within four or five chō of the vicinity. Saimyō-ji is also in the same village. It was founded during the Chōtoku era by Ōe no Sadamoto, Governor of Mikawa, and was called Rokkō-ji. Later, Hōjō Tokiyori came and stayed at this temple, renaming it Saimyō-ji. During the Entoku era, the priest Daiso became the founding abbot and converted it to the Sōtō Zen sect. Lord Ieyasu also inspected this temple and had it renamed Saimyō-ji.

●Zaiga-ji Located in Zaiga, Hirahata Village. It was founded by Gyōki and has Kūkai as its restoration founder. It is one of the seven Mikawa temples that Minamoto no Noriyori revered when he was Governor of Mikawa. It belongs to the Kogi Shingon sect.

○The Rice Field Festival of Zaiga-ji
This was once performed vigorously but was discontinued for a while after the Restoration, though it has been revived in recent years. Every year on the 5th day of the 1st month, people from Zaiga-ji village perform it at the Kannon Hall. More than ten people take various forms. Their song goes:
Yōshin'ya (Praise!) Tao wo tsukuru (Make rice fields) Kadotan wo tsukuru (Make front fields) Yōshin'ya (Praise!) Kadotan yori (From the front fields) Iri mansu ru tomo ni (Entering the distant fields together) Yōshin'ya Yuku tokoro (Where we go)

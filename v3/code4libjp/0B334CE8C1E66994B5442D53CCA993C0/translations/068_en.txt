petals. Heavenly wind blows the sea, splashing spring robes.
　　　Mount Miyaji
The shrine of the Jade Princess is ancient, dreams are dim. Green feathers and bright ornaments shine in twilight. The slender moon
Suddenly flies beyond the maple trees. On the cold mountain, one path returns with the apes.
　　　Cow Falls
Who split the Milky Way to ■ nine blues. Here in the valley mountains, spirits run. On the hanging cliff,
Pine sounds like waves in mid-heaven. Flying spray and wisteria vines, sleeves full of stars. Ten thousand fathoms of dragon
Fighting without rest. A hundred years of courage suddenly awakens. In bright moonlight, washing hair at the empty pool's
curve. Wanting to join the feathered immortals in striking the stone gate.
　　　Seven Falls
Pool clouds play with shadows, for whom do they make beauty? Fallen leaves on empty mountains seem to herald winter. Could it be
The heartbroken tears of gray apes? Flying streams scatter wildly on evening-sun pines.
　　　Cherry Abyss
The Toyo River flows a hundred li in one rush. Mountains on both banks drag eyebrows and lean temples. Mountains blue,
flowers white, people like jade. Jade mountains lean back in fragrant clouds. Half a lifetime's brocade bag

storing gold and stone. Heaven-startling, rock-splitting, naturally self-cherishing. Heaven and earth thus, I thus.
With awakened eyes reading poetry, what benefit is there? Those who pick green return to homes that pick stars.
Immortals and mortals separated, brief dreams distant. Looking back, ten thousand peaks in purple sunset. Golden
rooster crows across the pool full of flowers.
　　　Ruins of Nagashino Castle
Where are the cold clouds of the ancient castle platform? Barley grass thick, connected to blue cliffs. The barbarian-touch
dream awakens, how many springs have passed? Plum blossoms again illuminate the moss of skulls.
　　　Wild Goose Peak Mountain
Wild Goose Peak Mountain comes from the west. Splitting my horse's head, autumn green piles up. No hindrance to
chasing and laughing all day long. I have a jade qin and cloud wine vessels.
　　　Gamagōri Bamboo Branch
Outside the window, tides rise opening blue cosmetic boxes. Golden shuttles clicking, hair disheveled. Young men
snatch away the brocade from the loom. Directly making sails to ride the long wind and break the waves.
　　　Takeshima Island
Tidal mist and rock rain, blue and cold. Bamboo spirit rustles, sprinkling the shrine gate. Suddenly

fish and dragons cease their leaping spray. In evening sun above the bay, several peaks are blue.
　　　Sunrise at Stone Gate
How many thousand years since the spirit minister split it? Tidal caves and shore cliffs coil around nine abysses. At midnight
The old dragon already lifts the sun. Golden scales shatter, becoming smoke of sea and sky.
　　　Parrot Stone
North of Chenxiang Pavilion, before the peonies. Form is emptiness, spring like smoke. Green feathers
Flying alone, transformed into stone. Crying to clouds, speaking to rain for two thousand years.

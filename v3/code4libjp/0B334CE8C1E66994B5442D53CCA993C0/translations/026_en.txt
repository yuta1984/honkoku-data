　　Notice to Pilgrims to Toyokawa-san
Toyokawa's specialty Fukujuseki is a confection made to imitate the
small stones laid throughout the inner gate of Toyokawa-kaku's inner sanctuary.
It has gained such unprecedented popularity that people say "if you go to Toyokawa
and don't buy Okadaya's Fukujuseki, it's as if you haven't made the pilgrimage at all."
This is not only because of its refined flavor and elegant appearance,
but also because the registered trademark shows white foxes placing their paws
on both sides of the sacred jewel, making it truly the one and only souvenir item.
Moreover, since we have received awards at exhibitions,
this is truly the greatest honor for our shop. Therefore, we will continue
to carefully select our ingredients and give attention to our craftsmen,
striving not to betray your kind patronage, so we ask for your continued favor.

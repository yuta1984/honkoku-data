Due to this, the castle siege was halted and they returned to Kōfu, but the wound became increasingly severe, and finally on the 16th day of the same month, Shingen died at Fukuda Temple in Taguchi Village, Kita-Shitara District. The name of Suganuma Shin'hachirō became famous from this time.

●Nagakute Ancient Battlefield This is a famous place in history, so there should be no need for detailed explanation. The castle ruins are located along the confluence of the Kansaga River and Ōno River, upstream tributaries of the Toyo River, and the castle grounds are still clearly visible today. This ancient battlefield spans Nagakute Village, Shiraku Village, and Hirai Village, located about two ri northeast from Shinshiro Town, and can be reached in just over ten chō from Ōmi Station, the terminal of the Toyokawa Railway. This battle took place in the fifth month of Tenshō 3 (1575), when Takeda Katsuyori mobilized tens of thousands of elite troops to attack Okudaira Nobumasa. When Nobumasa was isolated in his castle without reinforcement and nearly on the verge of collapse, the incomparably brave Torii Kyūuemon sought aid from Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu. On the 18th day of the same month, after several hours of battle, the Takeda forces suffered a great defeat with many veteran generals killed, and Katsuyori barely escaped with his life in this great carnage.

　　　From Kosen Ikyoku-shū　　　　　Lord Nobunaga
　Calling himself Katsuyori, how worthless is this Takeda
　　　　　Losing in battle, having no Shinano left

　　　From Mikawa Ginkō　　　　　Ransen  
　At the ancient battlefield, green bamboo grows tall　Three thousand iron cavalry perished in an instant
　Insects cry like grudges, lone graves abandoned　Flying birds have no nests, high fortifications desolate  
　Chasing the fleeing north, seizing silver-nailed armor　Racing ahead, wielding green sunken spears
　Where are those brave warriors of the slow camp now?　River water flows empty, vast and boundless

　　Wheat and rapeseed show no color competing for spring　Chōmu
　　In wheat harvest, remove your hat at the pursuing vanguard　Kojiki

●Ganpō Mountain A high mountain visible northeast from Shinshiro, also called Kanbō Pass. I think because it stands out among all the mountains as a high peak, it means "cold pass." This mountain is said to be where Torii Kyūuemon Katsutaka escaped from Nagakute Castle, cut through underwater nets, safely sought aid, and raised signal smoke. However, another theory says that the fire signal Torii raised was on Funatsuki Mountain or Torinosu Mountain.

　One year, Bashō climbed this mountain and as the day grew dark, he stayed at Mongatani at the foot. Hakusetsu thoughtfully sent word to the mountain and borrowed bedding to comfort against the night cold. The next morning:
　Praying out one night robe for travel sleep　Bashō

○Torii Katsutaka Monument Located in Ōaza Arikai, Shiraku Village. The monument face reads "Chikai Jōtsū Koji" and on the back "Tenshō 3, Year of the Boar, 5th month, 16th day, lay name Torii Kyūuemon Katsutaka, age 36." On leaving the castle on the night of the 14th day of the 5th month:
　　The jeweled cord of life that substitutes for my lord's life
　　　　What should a warrior's way disdain?

On the side it reads "Erected on the 16th day of late autumn, Hōreki 3, Year of the Sheep."

○Graves of Kōshū Forces In Nagakute Village (about one chō where the Nagakute road branches west from Shinshiro) is the grave of Baba Nobufusa. In Ōaza Takehiro, Hirai Village are the graves of Naitō Masatoyo and Yamagata Masakage, and in the same village is the grave of Kōsaka Masanobu. Many who mourn the Nagakute ancient battlefield visit these burial grounds to reminisce about past events. There are various other historical sites including Daitsū Temple.

　　○Record of Torii Katsutaka Raising Signal Fires
Torii Kyūuemon Katsutaka was born in Ichida Village, Hōi District, and served the Okudaira family. In Tenshō 3, when Takeda Katsuyori besieged Nagakute Castle, though the castle defended well, provisions were scarce with only four or five days' worth remaining. Castle lord Okudaira Nobumasa was greatly worried and tried to plan countermeasures, but no consensus was reached among his retainers. Then 36-year-old Katsutaka stepped forward and said: "I will sneak out of the castle tonight and report our dire situation to Hamamatsu. If I safely accomplish my mission, I will climb Ganpō Pass and raise signal fires

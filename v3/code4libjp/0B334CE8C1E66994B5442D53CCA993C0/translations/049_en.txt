and so forth, when they heard a cuckoo singing in mid-air:
Imperial composition:
Will you sing to match the village name, oh cuckoo?
Should it be limited to just one call?
Thus the Emperor proceeded from the Shinano road to the Kiso Pass and returned to the capital.

○Shiratori Shrine: Located in Shimo-tsugu Village, this is one of the oldest shrines, established since the Meitoku era, and is particularly famous for preserving an ancient temple bell from Meitoku 3 (1392).

○Twelve Scenic Views: Twelve scenic spots have been selected around Tsugu village, as follows:
Old cherry at Kinryū-ji, Bush warbler at Tenjin-yama, Early bracken at Takayama
Fireflies at Amida River, Cuckoo at Kurabashi-yama, Cool evening at Fudō Falls
Harvest moon at Atago-yama, Rice harvest at Maeda, Deer at Rigaku-yama
Winter shower at Hagitare-yama, Deep snow at Tengu Rock, Firewood at Kiji-yama

●Monument to Elder Furuhashi: Located in Inahashi Village, this monument was erected by the villagers for the late Elder Furuhashi Haraichirō (Teruchika) of the same village, who devoted himself early to industrial development, enlightened and guided the villagers, and made considerable contributions to national interests. The elder passed away on December 24, Meiji 25 (1892) at the age of 80. The monument was erected in December, Meiji 30 (1897).

●Mount Dando (Horse Breeding): Located in Danrei Village, this is Mikawa's premier imperial forest where trees grow densely and one feels cold even in summer. The Dando Stock Farm operates by borrowing part of this imperial land. Currently there are over 100 stallions at the site, receiving an annual subsidy of 1,000 yen from Aichi Prefecture, making it one of the leading enterprises in the prefecture and indeed in our country.

○Salamanders and Others: In the valleys of Mount Dando, there are peculiar fish commonly called salamanders or anglerfish, which local people catch and use as stomach medicine. Playing in these mountains during summer days offers considerable interest and would provide significant academic benefits.

○Waterfalls and Hot Springs: Since this district is mountainous terrain, there are waterfalls everywhere - tall ones dropping 50-60 jō and even short ones falling more than one jō straight down, numbering in the dozens. I will not record each one here. As for hot springs, there are virtually none, with only Kiyosaki Hot Spring in Ōaza Kiyosaki, Taguchi Village, and Natsuyaki Hot Spring in Ōaza Natsuyaki, Inahashi Village, but these are insufficient to attract bathers.

○Hoi District

●Origins: This district was established earliest in Mikawa Province, as evidenced by the placement of the provincial capital, the construction of the provincial temple, and Toga Shrine being designated as the first-ranked shrine. Also, old records show that Mikawa was called Ho-no-kuni in ancient times and this district was also called Ho-no-kuni in antiquity, which sufficiently demonstrates that this district was the foundation of Mikawa Province. Hoi District's name likely derives from Ho-no-kuni. In Engi 3 (903), Shitara District was established by dividing this district, as mentioned in the section on Shitara District.

●Goyu: Has the district office, tax office, police station, postal and telegraph office, etc. However, the Tōkaidō Railway line does not pass near the urban area, and although there is a Goyu Station, it is over one ri away, causing considerable inconvenience. Therefore, the current situation does not match former times. This place was formerly called Naka-Goi, and there were three villages of the same name: Kami-Goi, Naka-Goi, and Shimo-Goi. However, due to confusion, the "Kami" was removed from Kami-Goi to call it simply Goi, and Naka-Goi was changed

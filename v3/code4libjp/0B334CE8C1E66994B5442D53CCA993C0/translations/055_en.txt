The descendants of Lord Honda settled in Owari, and later the entire clan from Mikawa came to serve the Tokugawa family, with Masatada being particularly favored (omitted). After pacifying eastern Mikawa and returning, during a banquet at Ina, Masatada presented dishes arranged on plates lined with hollyhock leaves. Lord Okazaki (Ieyasu) was pleased to see this and said, "I have obtained this through my triumphant return. Henceforth this shall be our family crest." Initially the Tokugawa family had used the naka-guro (centered black circle) crest following their clan tradition, but from this point they began to use the three-leaf hollyhock crest as well.

●Record of Manzai
What the world calls Mikawa Manzai has its origins when, during the Chōtoku era (995-999) of the 66th Emperor Ichijō's reign, Ōe no Sadamoto was appointed as Mikawa no Kami and came to this province. Lord Sadamoto devoted his heart to Buddhism, receiving teachings from the monk Genshin of Yokawa, and became deeply learned in Buddhist studies. He explained the circumstances of Buddhism's transmission to Japan and taught dances called Senzairaku and Manzairaku to one Kira Tayū, the estate manager of Kariya, to be performed as New Year celebrations. This was the beginning of Mikawa Manzai, which was not the vulgar entertainment it is today. The dancers come from Ina Village in Hoi District. The origins of manzai arose from Kyoto, stemming from the old custom where on the 14th and 15th days of the first month, pleasure-seekers in Kyoto would sing and dance here and there under the moonlight. Specifically, on the 14th day, those of fourth rank and below from both the court and common areas would go around appropriate places singing, dancing, and playing saibara court music. At that time it was called Senshū Manzai, but in later generations it was abbreviated to simply Manzai.

●Record of Dai-Kagura
Called the Dai-Kagura of Kosakai and Ina Village, it is known far and wide today. In the past, every year from the first to the second month, performers would come out into the towns to sing and dance. Their dancing style, singing style, and flute playing seem unchanged from ancient times to now. I believe this is dance taken from what appears in the Age of Gods chronicles, when Amaterasu Ōmikami secluded herself in the heavenly rock cave and the eighty myriad deities stood before the cave door performing skillfully. Also, the Taiheiki records how when the Keimyōin-dono moved to Yoshino, lion field music was summoned and performed day and night. Dai-Kagura is likely a transformation of these traditions.

●Izumi Shikibu Stone Pagoda Located within the precincts of Daido-san Hōon-ji Temple in Ina Village. It is said to be the grave of Ono no Komachi, with the tradition that Ono no Komachi came by boat from Tsuchida Bay in Ise Province to Kosakai Harbor. The historical verification is not detailed.

●Shōgan-ji Located in Shimoji-machi, it belongs to the Takada sect of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism, founded by the monk Gyōen. The principal image of Amida Nyorai is said to be carved by Prince Shōtoku. To the west-southwest of the main hall is the Prince Shōtoku Hall, and the standing statue is said to be a sacred image carved by the Prince himself. Behind the main hall in the bamboo grove are the remains of bathhouse facilities from when Lord Ieyasu established his military headquarters there.

●Bashō Mounds in This District
There are several Bashō mounds within Hoi District. One is located on the south side of the Prince Shōtoku Hall within the precincts of Shōgan-ji Temple in Shimoji-machi. It bears an engraved poem that Master Bashō composed at a tea shop in this village during his eastward journey in Jōkyō 4 (1687). People call it the Pine Needle Mound. In Meiwa 6 (1769), haiku poets of Yoshida, yearning for the elegant traces of Bashō's school, erected this stone monument. On the reverse side is an inscription by Yaari.

Burning fish scraps, warming a hand towel—such cold! —Bashō

Long ago Master Bashō stopped his staff at this place and left behind this verse. The people living here, deeply revering the elegance of Bashō's school, went all the way to distant Gichū-ji Temple in Ōmi to take soil from the old master's grave, built a mound at this spot, erected this stone, obtained three large characters from Master Hakuin to copy onto the stone's surface, and thought to make it even more certain as a site of historical traces. When this was accomplished, they asked me to record the circumstances on the back of the stone. Ah! To be so revered in distant ages shows the master's virtue, and such reverence shows these people's sincerity. Unable to decline, I took up my poor brush, moved by this rare and magnificent deed.

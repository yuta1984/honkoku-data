The Yamada Inn on the left was formerly called the Itō Inn. Fortunately, as it was next to our transportation branch office, we acquired the building for the first time last December and made major repairs, first improving air circulation. Moreover, since it faces directly toward the station and is in the closest location for transferring to Yoshida Station, it is extremely convenient not only for boarding, alighting, and lodging, but we will also handle all matters with utmost care and kindness. Therefore, we hope that when you travel or visit Toyokawa Inari Shrine for worship, you will continue to stay with us with your renewed patronage. Respectfully submitted.

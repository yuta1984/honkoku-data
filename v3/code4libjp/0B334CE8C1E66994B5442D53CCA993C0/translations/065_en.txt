Two

The spring source emerges atop Mount Kannon. Water falls to the village below Mount Kannon. Tall trees
of a thousand trunks merge their green shade. The flying cascade of a hundred feet turns like snow flowers. Joyfully seeking the sacred realm,
intoxicated by the coolness. Escaping the burning heat and troubles of the human world. One bath, three cups, bathing again and again.
This delightful journey is also the grace of great compassion.

　　　Miscellaneous Poems on Gamagōri
The intent of poetic wandering is not in hot springs. Atop the tower I dislike the clamor of bathers. I gladly
buy a small boat and moor at Takeshima. Under the dragon lantern pine, I wish to open my gourd flask.
At midday the wind is calm, wanting to be without waves. Swimming and calling to each other, many bathers. Alone I
pole a light boat to play at Buddha Island. The strange shells I gathered resemble lotus flowers.

　　　Maeshiba White Small Fish
Capital people compete to admire the crystal scales. Their reputation like pearls, their color like silver. Tonight
they leap above the waves of Shiba River. Tomorrow morning they become delicacies for the imperial table.

　　　Spring Day at Zaiga Temple
Sitting quietly watching flowers, worldly concerns become empty. Drinking from the remaining gourd, intoxicated by spring wind. Going up
to pay respects to Kannon. The temple stands amid fragrant clouds and warm snow.

Alone following the clear spring weather, I try one excursion. Cherry blossoms magnificently blooming, weighing down the dense branches. Where the thousand-year-old
ancient Buddha opens his shrine. Clustered fragrant clouds protect the temple tower.

　　　Toka Shrine
In this sacred realm there is no burning heat. Dense hundred-foot cedars. Not a speck of dust ever arrives.
Cool air drips on my poetry robe.

　　　Tōjō Myōryū Temple
Going to the pure temple among pines to seek tea. The sound of one temple bell emerges from evening mist. The water mill
continuously pounds without rest. The spring flow also naturally aids the incense and flowers.

　　　Shiratori Village Sōsha
The provincial governor distributes offerings to worship the deities. The name of the general shrine remains, passed down in oral tradition. When autumn ages,
the frosted forest's colors are like brocade. I imagine seeing the dignified ceremony of a thousand ages past.

　　　Bentaiten of Sanmyōji Temple, Toyokawa
　　　　It is said in worldly tradition that this is the posthumous image of Princess Rikiju. Could this indeed be true?
The pagoda venerates and makes her into Bentaiten. Again, this heart is not by chance. Her jade countenance
is upright and combines good fortune. Her flower-like face shows loving-kindness and beauty. Who would think that clouds and rain

would become sorrowful parting. Thus causing court officials to form religious connections. The provincial governor's mansion, all people have gone
completely. Only the famous princess's posthumous image remains for a thousand years.

　　　Shimoji Fireworks
Thunder sounds roaring west and east. Brocade clouds and jeweled rain cover the blue sky. Since night came
there are even more wonderful techniques displayed. Several schools of goldfish leap in the water.

　　　Visiting Takeshima
At this moment not a speck of dust comes to disturb. Green trees and clear shade at Tennyo Hall. The turtle island's
misty waves connect to Kashima. The sacred mountain's misty green borders the divine realm. All people are leisurely and elegant,
boats still peaceful. The fish are fresh and the sake also fragrant. The poems I found searching become
material for other days. Each superb thing I store in my travel bag.

　　　Chōzan Shōgen'in
By chance arriving at this garden due to official business. Much gratitude for the mountain monk's sincere hospitality. Sharp claws of
the thousand-year tengu mystery. The wonderful form of the one-inch Jizō statue. Idle clouds drift
passing over the bed. Clear water trickles, washing the stone roots. The peach blossom spring of the Jin dynasty was merely
fantasy. Nothing compares to entering Shōgen today.

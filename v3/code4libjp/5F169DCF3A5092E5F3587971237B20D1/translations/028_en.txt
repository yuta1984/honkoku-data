Year after year, the cherry blossoms are numerous,
but year after year, the varieties of new publications are not the same.
We continue to exhaust our skills in illustration and strive in the craft of engraving,
producing rare and interesting books one after another,
so please continue to purchase and view them unchanged for thousands of generations.

　　　　　　　　　　To all gentlemen

I reported earlier by express messenger that the third and second baileys were captured as early as the seventh hour (around 4 PM), burned and destroyed. The main bailey was also stormed at the hour of the Rooster (around 6 PM) and burned. Everything was completed at once, which I consider most fortunate. As expected, there are many wounded. Since I do not know about the other units, I report only on my own forces. Respectfully and humbly submitted.

Furthermore, although we have killed them all, the number of Christians slain is not yet known. The senior commissioners will report on this later. While making this report, we stormed up to the second bailey. Since we cannot send urgent letters to the lords in Osaka and Kyoto from inside, please be advised accordingly. This should also be reported to Edo. The senior commissioners will provide detailed reports. That is all.

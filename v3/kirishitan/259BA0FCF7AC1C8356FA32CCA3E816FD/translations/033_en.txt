They carried him on their shoulders back to the hut and gave him medicine, which restored him to consciousness. When he somewhat regained his senses and tried to get up and rush out of the hut again, his retainers restrained him from front and back, saying, "You have suffered such a serious injury, and it would be presumptuous to charge into the castle again." Then Itō said, "Even though I have suffered a deep wound, how can I lie in a hut during the height of the castle attack? The spirit of a warrior is not something you can understand. If you insist on restraining me further, I will strike you down." His anger caused his retainers to abandon Itō and flee. The hut guard Imai Denuemon was then asked to help: "Our master Sakyoshi, despite suffering a serious wound, is trying to charge into the castle again. Please stop him."

So Denuemon chased after Sakyoshi to restrain him, but he had already run up to the middle of the slope below the fence, where he finally collapsed from exhaustion. The retainers carried him back to the hut again, and the physician Hansai administered medicine and various treatments, barely saving his life. Meanwhile, following the first wave of attackers who had stormed into the second bailey, among both vanguard units were: rōnin Inoue Sukenosuke, rōnin Yamamoto Yoemon, Takei Yasudayū, Ichīnosuke (eldest son of Takagi Gorōdayū), Deidō Izaemon, Hayakawa Gonroku, rōnin Yanagisawa Dayū, Kajimura Shichibē, Inoue Den'hachi, Nakano Chūemon, Suzuki Yaemon (Suzumura), Hori Rihē, Asahina Genzaemon, and Yoshikawa Yajūrō.

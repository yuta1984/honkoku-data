Izu-no-kami and Samon came out to observe, thinking that rebels might be lurking front and back. They sent one or two gunners up onto the earthworks of the outer bailey and placed one or two earth-filled bags there, but there was not a single rebel in the outer bailey.

From the third bailey, Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami and Tachibana Hida-no-kami charged in, and from the second bailey, Arima Gemba-no-kami and Matsuura Nagato-no-suke charged

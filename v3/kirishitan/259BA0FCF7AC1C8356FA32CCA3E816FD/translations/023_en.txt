Yamago was wounded and withdrew. Lord Hosokawa and Lord Tachibana pressed forward from the beach side, attacking from the lotus pond toward the corner of the main bailey. The fierce battle continued for a long time, but as evening approached, a messenger from the supreme commander brought orders that "all forces should withdraw." Upon hearing this, Ukon thought, "How can we attack once night falls?" and together with his subordinates, he himself wielded his command baton and led his immediate retainers in charging into the main bailey. Kuwano and Yamago also joined together, entering through the right corner of the wooden gate entrance. Following them came Ito Hanemon, Uchida Yasuemon, Suga Kitaro, Nozoe Jihei, and Naito Kuhei, who seized banners in their fury. From above, Kuwano took one and threw it into the main bailey. When Ukon charged in and faced the enemy, wielding his command baton and shouting "Fire the rifles!"

The enemy took careful aim and shot Ukon in his left shoulder. Even so, Ukon did not abandon his position, but due to repeated messengers from Lord Izu-no-kami and Lord Samon, he finally withdrew from the main bailey. When evening came on the 27th day and the various generals who had charged into the main bailey were observed, only Ukon was there. If so, then Ukon must have been the first to enter the main bailey. After charging in, he continued firing rifles throughout the night while maintaining his defense.

According to the Terasawa record, on the 27th day of the second month, Nabeshima Shinano-no-kami led the advance and entered the castle. Katataka followed and broke through the outer bailey, quickly attacking into the second bailey. The next day, the castle finally fell. In this battle, many enemies were killed. Our forces also had casualties, and the inspector for the dead was Sugihara Shirobei.

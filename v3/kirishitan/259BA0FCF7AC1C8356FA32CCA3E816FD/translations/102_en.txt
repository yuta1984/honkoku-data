In the morning, Lord Kuroda's advance guard attached to the stone wall of the corner position. Since it was unclear what they were doing inside and they appeared to be in some confusion, Lord Tango-no-kami's forces pressed close to the base of the stone wall. Jirōemon jumped up onto a small mound and waited with a path cleared in front. He was prepared to storm into the main bailey depending on how things developed. Yesterday, having been beaten back from the stone wall three times, the cord of his standard had shrunk, so he devised a method of tying corner paper to a thin bamboo pole and fashioning it as a waist ornament to serve as a marker when climbing the stone wall and to signal his allies.

At that point, Lord Kuroda repeatedly sent messengers to Lord Tango-no-kami, saying "There is no other business today, and moreover, the advance guard shows no restraint in their preparations, which is quite troublesome recently."

In response to this, Lord Tango-no-kami gave the order to "withdraw," and everyone withdrew accordingly. However, since some remained behind, he ordered through his younger brother Lord Ogasawara Izumo-no-kami that they "must withdraw without fail." At that time, Jirōemon also complied with this intention. Though it appeared as if he had not properly received the orders due to this situation, this was not the case at all. There were various such exchanges of words.

It also states that since the castle was largely ready to fall, that same evening at the hour of the Monkey (around 3-5 PM), the senior officials announced that all units should withdraw to their huts, and this was complied with. Lord Tango-no-kami also naturally agreed and returned to his hut.

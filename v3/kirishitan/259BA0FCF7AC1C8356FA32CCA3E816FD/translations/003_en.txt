Records of the Suppression of Christianity, Volume 31

Memorandum of the first warriors to breach enemy lines at each position during the general assault on Hara Castle in Arima Village, Takaki District, Hizen Province. On the 27th day of the 2nd month of Kan'ei 15, year of the Earth Tiger (1638), during the early part of the hour of the Sheep (around 1-2 PM), Sakakibara Hida-no-kami and the same Saemon are said to have achieved the first breach into the outer bailey of Hara Castle's second bailey. That morning, as the enemy had abandoned the outer bailey and many had retreated, after Nabeshima Shinano-no-kami consulted with Matsudaira Izu-no-kami, orders were given. While having light infantry ascend to our earthworks and carry up earth-filled bags, cotton bales, and such, firearms were discharged from the lateral curved fortification on the right side, striking down one man who tumbled from the earthwork. However, the remaining men scattered and fled like baby spiders.

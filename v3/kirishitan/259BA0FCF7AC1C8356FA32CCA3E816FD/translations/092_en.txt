They engaged with spears. Then [the Christians], wearing cotton garments like women's sleeves, came down below and threw many wakizashi (short swords) and other weapons like shuriken, but since they threw them high, they did not hit our side. After Jūkura-dono finished with his spear, Sadayū took Jūkura-dono's hand and pushed three steps into our allies' ranks before withdrawing. A young warrior reported this, so no pursuit was undertaken, and when they withdrew, Tachibana Sakon-dono's attendant Kōzuma Saibei said this was reasonable, and they retreated. Then, sitting on the wall of the main compound, they had their foot soldiers fire guns for observation, and those who achieved military distinction by taking heads all brought them before Jūkura-dono. When Jūkura-dono showed them to Sadayū, he said that depending on what that person claimed, evidence should be presented in the hut.

So they were brought to Sadayū's place. Names and family names were carved into the scabbards. Furthermore, Sadayū said that although he would like to continue observing indefinitely, he wondered if it would be acceptable for Mondo-dono's spear engagement time to be delayed. Jūkura-dono acknowledged this, and went with Mondo-dono before Izu-no-kami-dono. When they went out to the lotus pond area, someone grabbed Jūkura-dono and said, "Today I encountered something unusual, but since I was wounded, I could not achieve any military distinction, which I find regrettable." [Jūkura-dono] replied, "What are you saying? This surpasses any military achievement many times over - why do you speak of unnecessary things?" So [the person] said, "If that is how you think of it, then it is acceptable," and accompanied him before Izu-no-kami-dono.

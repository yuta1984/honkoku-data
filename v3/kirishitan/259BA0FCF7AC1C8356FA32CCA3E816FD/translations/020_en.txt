charged in. From the outer bailey, forces of Nabeshima, Ogasawara Ukon-dayū, Matsudaira Tango-no-kami, Ogasawara Shinano-no-kami, and Toda Samon charged in. From Amakusa-maru, Matsukura Izu-no-kami, Itakura Mondo-no-shō, Inoue Chikugo-no-kami, Ishigai Jūzō, Baba Saburōzaemon-no-jō, Makino Denzō, and other envoys from various provinces charged in from the third bailey. Hayashi Tamba-no-kami, being assigned to Matsudaira Uemon-no-suke's forces, charged in from Ōeguchi. Matsudaira Jinzaburō had been wounded on New Year's Day and had difficulty standing, so he was in convalescence, but he rode in a palanquin and charged in from the second bailey beside the outer bailey. Meeting Sakakibara Hida-no-kami, who had achieved the first charge, Jinzaburō encountered him in the second bailey, where Sakakibara Hida-no-kami

made a sworn statement asserting without doubt his claim to the first charge, explaining this to Jinzaburō. Then, as Hida-no-kami's son Saemon-no-suke was fighting and performing deeds against the rebels, he showed this to Jinzaburō saying "Look at my son Saemon-no-suke's performance." Jinzaburō replied with courtesy, "Indeed, I have seen it well," and at this place they agreed to capture up to the main bailey and parted from each other. When everyone gave their opinions, Jinzaburō was praised as a quick and agile warrior. They heard that his conduct at Amakusa-maru was also excellent, and many praised him as a fine warrior, whether as a general or as a common soldier.

were stone walls, or steep places within the shore area in two locations, and to those who attached themselves there, from within the castle they threw firearms, stones, timber, and burning thatch, or dropped down pots, stones, and even mortars, causing very many wounded and dead. In the rear formation were Etchū-no-kami, Higo-no-kami, and then Izu-no-kami and others, and also the inspector of this unit, Baba Saburozaemon, was observing. Because there were far too many wounded and many battle deaths, all the government envoys held a consultation and decided that the forces should be withdrawn. However, at the late hour of the Rooster, the advance forces under Nagaoka Sado stormed into the main bailey first from the sea-facing corner. Masuda Yaichizaemon and Okamoto Den'jūrō followed and broke in, then came Masuda Saisuke. Saisuke immediately set fire to the breach point, and similarly

those who set fires were the foot soldiers Yamauchi Gohē, Hirai Jinbē, Iwao Makibē'emon, and Saitō Shōzō. Also, those who broke in at the same time as Yaichizaemon were the walking pages Togō Tahē, Gotō Gon'emon, and Ikenaga Gentayū. Those who quickly broke in from above the lotus pond to the sea-facing square area were Hayamizu Ichirōbē, Tsugawa Shirōzaemon, Kawakita Kyūdayū, and Yamada Shinkurō. The other forces all broke in together and set fire to several buildings in the main bailey. They captured the eastern sea-facing area, planted the nine-star banner, and built palisades at the burned entrance.

It is also said that on the night of the 27th, the first to break into the main bailey by himself from the lower level of the second bailey was Arima Saemon, and Arima Kurando also broke in and planted a banner.

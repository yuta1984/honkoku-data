He rushed there and climbed up to that watchtower, observing the enemy's retreat. At that moment, Lord Miura Shima-no-kami and Lord Murakoshi Shichirō Zaemon, both accompanied by Lord Inoue Chikugo-no-kami and Lord Ishigaya Jūzō, were inspecting the various attack points. They climbed up to the watchtower where Tadasato was positioned and reported having observed the enemy's withdrawal. At this time, Lord Ishigaya Jūzō addressed Tadasato, saying, "Genba-no-kami, since you were assigned this Takei tower and had intensive musket fire conducted, the castle defenders have abandoned the outer bailey and retreated, so there is no longer any need to assault it." After this, Tadasato returned to Arima Naiki's quarters.

A military messenger was sent to Nabeshima asking, "Since we have been shooting severe flanking fire from our watchtower, the enemy has abandoned and retreated from the outer bailey this morning. Shall we place bamboo markers inside the outer bailey?" Shinano-no-kami replied, "Even though you may have heard that the enemy abandoned the outer bailey tonight, recently there have been such instances where they send out troops again at night, so it is difficult to determine whether they have definitely abandoned the outer bailey." After a while, one warrior emerged from Nabeshima's advance guard, struck the earthen sacks placed in the loopholes of the outer bailey, looked around here and there, and returned. It was later learned that this warrior was a rōnin named Sakai Zensaemon, who had been entrusted with serving as guardian to Kingo, the son of Sakakibara Hida-no-kami.

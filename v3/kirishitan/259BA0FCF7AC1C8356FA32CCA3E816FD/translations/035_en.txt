Mizuno Sukenosuke, Oka Sanshirō, Takano Jirōsuke, 
and others. In addition to these, among the rōnin were
Yamaji Iemon, Konishi Kyūbē, Ishihara Matabē,
Yoshida Hikoemon,
and others. Among them, Ichiki Shōzaemon's eldest son Tōjūrō was wounded in the hand and wanted to return to the hut, but Shōzaemon instructed him, saying: "Generally, when wounded, returning from the front line to the rear formation according to the severity of the wound is an ancient law. Since you are young, do you think that even when wounded in the hand, you should withdraw quickly? However, even if your performance exceeds others, do not concern yourself with that at all. As long as your limbs remain sound, rush back to the main tiger's mouth and kill even one more enemy." Hearing this, Tōjūrō said "I understand" and returned to fight, battling despite his painful hand until he was finally killed. When Toyoshi spoke of Tōjūrō's death in battle on one occasion, he was said to be deeply moved by his father Shōzaemon's words at that time. Thus the enemy finally tried to take refuge within the second bailey but were driven out, and while they held their position near Lotus Pond, the soldiers of our forces charged without pause. Hayakawa Gonroku, Miyakawa Magojūrō and others again took heads there. At this point, Shimomura San'nosuke, who had been at Toyoshi's main camp, saw our forces charging into the second bailey and hurriedly rushed to the front line with our allies

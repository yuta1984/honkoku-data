They took the heads of enemies, and each head was recorded in the requisition documents. At this time, there were also many who struck down enemies but did not take their heads. Examining both of these cases, on the 27th day of the 12th month, Itakura Naizen issued military regulations stating that "even if there are those unworthy of a warrior's conduct, all should not be abandoned to be struck down."

For this reason, those who observed the previous regulations deliberately did not take heads. Also, those who were wounded at this time were:

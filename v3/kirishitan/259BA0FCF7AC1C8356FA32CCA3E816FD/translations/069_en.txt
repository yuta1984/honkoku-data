"We shall attack" and had the conch shells blown and drums beaten, leading over ten thousand cavalry in a charge to storm the castle. At that time, Kuroda Mimasaka, a retainer of Kuroda Tadayuki, was in a watchtower and commanded: "The castle of Hara cannot be taken. When Nabeshima's forces pushed up to the side of the opposite mountain, they attacked - this premature attack is not good." However, things went as planned, and he waved his war fan to advance all forces and achieved victory.

Recorded in the "Namikawa-shi Oboegaki" (Namikawa Family Memorandum):
1. Those who died in battle during the castle assault on the 27th day of the 2nd month:
　Namikawa (1000 koku) Kakuemon　Okazaki (1000 koku) Hyōzaemon {{Note: Because the night of the night attack was unfavorable, he died in battle on the 27th}}
　Murao (200 koku) Shinkurō　Kusaba (150 koku) Rokunosuke　Yamada (page, 150 koku) Iori
　Murata (masterless samurai receiving stipend assistance rice) Dōsai　Miyake (150 koku) Ichigaku

Recorded in the "Kirishitan Hōki Oboegaki" (Christian Uprising Memorandum):
　I urgently report: At the hour of the Sheep on the 27th day of the 2nd month, we captured the walls of the third bailey on our side and immediately pressed inside. We pushed up to the edge of the second bailey, and as soon as we set up the palisades and bamboo bundles, I will report again. Since I write in haste, my handwriting is thus. I do not yet know about the various baileys. The senior commissioners will make their reports. Please also inform Lord Abe Bitchū, Lord Inagaki Settsu-no-kami, and Lord Itakura Suō-no-kami of this matter. I will report again in detail. Respectfully and humbly submitted.

When approaching the outer bailey (demaru), the besieging forces could identify each other, and while the besiegers had long desired to take the outer bailey, now the castle was abandoning and surrendering it. Nabeshima Shinano-no-kami sent a messenger to inform Matsudaira Izu-no-kami, who arrived at the location together with Toda Saemon Ujitetsu, surveyed the situation, and made plans.

From the beginning, all attacking forces were subjected to musket fire, causing universal confusion. Within the castle, from the third bailey to the main bailey's main entrance, they had dug trenches roughly the height of a person across the roadway to block arrow paths. However, at the eastern side of the outer bailey, from the watchtower at the front of Arima Gemba's approach works, horizontally toward the west...

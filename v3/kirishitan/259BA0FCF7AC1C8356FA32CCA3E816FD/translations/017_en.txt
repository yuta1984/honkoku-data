was steep like a mountain, and moreover the stone walls were high, so it would be difficult to charge in while riding in a palanquin. "If that is the case, my retainers, abandon the palanquin and charge into the main keep," he commanded, so his rōtō also charged in, not to be outdone. However, among those brave men, some died in battle there, as I have heard. Everyone praised him, saying, "Jinsaburō's determination must be stronger than even that of Saitō Sanemori."

It is also recorded that Matsudaira Kai-no-kami, the son of the general Izu-no-kami, on the 27th day of the second month when the castle fell, preceded his father Izu-no-kami and charged from the third bailey into the second bailey with only his own troops, charging straight ahead to the base of the main keep's stone walls, leading from the very front himself. The troops

who accompanied Kai-no-kami sustained wounded and dead at the base of the main keep, as I understand. When he was about to charge into the main keep, Inoue Chikugo-no-kami came and said, "Since your father Izu-no-kami is the general this time, when the various daimyō of the vanguard established military law, there was a firm agreement that even our son Kai-no-kami should not be allowed to go ahead first. Please, you must return to the rear." Since he said this, Kai-no-kami had no choice but to return to his father Izu-no-kami's presence. Those who saw and heard this all said it was regrettable to hold back such a young warrior, but none were angry. Everyone who saw praised Kai-no-kami's conduct as exceptionally admirable.

It is also recorded that Seibyōe-no-jō, the son of Inoue Chikugo-no-kami, also on the 27th day of the second month when the castle fell

Rōnin troops at Shigenori's camp
One: Suzuki Den'emon had positioned himself below the wall since last night. When dawn broke, he and two others - Ikeda Shinbee and Ban Sanzaemon《marginal note: envoy of Ogasawara Tosa-no-kami》- climbed over the wall. When the rebels defended strictly with spears and long swords all aligned, Den'emon used his spear to strike down two enemies. When engaging the third, a bullet hit his forehead and lodged in his helmet's bowl, and he died in battle at that spot. A servant named Haru removed Sakich's corpse.

One: Kuroyanagi Sunsai was first to reach below the wall and fought thrusting through the loopholes. He seized a spear that thrust out from within the castle. Large stones were dropped from above.

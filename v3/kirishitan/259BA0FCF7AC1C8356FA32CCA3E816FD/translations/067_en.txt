Making such an assessment to himself, he withdrew about three towns and set up defenses. As expected, the enemy emerged from behind the fence, and our vanguard forces began to collapse in confusion. Although Kinemon, ashamed of his previous words, said he would hold his ground, most of his unit collapsed. Mino had positioned his men in a good location and did not move at all. Because he held firm with his main force, the collapsing allied forces were able to regroup and strengthen their defenses. Mino was a person who had experienced numerous battles at Sekigahara and Osaka, and was a former retainer of his previous lord Uesugi Kagekatsu. At the time of Shimabara, he was over ninety years old, but was indeed vigorous with no signs of senility, appearing as robust as a person of about fifty.

The Gakuha-shū states that during the Shimabara Rebellion, Matsudaira Izu-no-kami's son Kai-no-kami attempted to charge ahead to gain military glory, but this did not come to pass. At that time, Ōkubo Hikozaemon said to Izu-no-kami: "You are clever in various ways, but you are not well-versed in military matters." When Izu-no-kami asked what he meant by this, he replied: "Your son Kai-no-kami may have shown the valor of a young man's charge, but your way of handling things has become like brocade in darkness." When Izu-no-kami asked what this meant, he said: "When Kai-no-kami made his charge, you should have given him orders. For us to serve in your army, and for his son to break military law is inexcusable," and he was placed under house arrest.

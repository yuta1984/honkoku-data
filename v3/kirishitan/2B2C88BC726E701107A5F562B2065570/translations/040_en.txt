Showing his resolve to die in battle, he composed this death poem:

Last year's New Year I tied the cords of my court cap, this year's New Year I tie the cords of my armor - what a changing world this is, as I go forth to battle

The flower that blooms ahead in the New Year
Know it as the harbinger of spring that leaves its name in the world

Itakura Naizen-no-shō

The above poem - since Naizen had been a page to His Lordship, he wrote it especially for the hatamoto retainers who were close to him. What Naizen said to Jūzō on the morning of New Year's Day was: "In this world where samurai's divine fortune runs out, each has sworn in writing to expose their heads [to danger], but we too may have exhausted our divine fortune. In Edo this morning, everyone would be going to the castle to offer New Year congratulations, yet we are each about to expose our heads [to death] - what an urgent matter this is."

It is also said that since the various forces had withdrawn and could not mount a second assault, Jūzō also withdrew very quietly from beneath the wall. The musket fire directed at them from left and right afterward was considerable. Truly, people all praised Jūzō's withdrawal as magnificent. During this withdrawal, among all the units some behaved well, while there were also many who withdrew to places with poor footing and whose behavior appeared poor.

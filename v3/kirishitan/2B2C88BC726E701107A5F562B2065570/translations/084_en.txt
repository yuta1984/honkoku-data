Recorded in the Shimabara Chronicle
　1. When we consulted with Nabeshima Shinano-no-kami, Arima Gemba, the retainers of Tachibana Hida-no-kami, and
　　Matsukura Nagato-no-kami about whether these men could take the castle, or whether we should
　　proceed with siege warfare, they said they could take it,
　　so we had them press the attack from before dawn this morning.

　1. Nabeshima's advance forces attacked close to the walls, but could not
　　mount an assault, and there were some wounded and dead.

　1. Arima Gemba's men approached the base of the walls before dawn, but ultimately
　　could not break through and collapsed back, with many wounded and dead.

　1. Matsukura Nagato-no-kami's main forces hesitated to advance, and among them we saw some who appeared

　　angry, so when the men of both Gemba and Nagato-no-kami
　　would not advance, Naizen and we rushed out and gave orders, but
　　they still would not advance. Having no choice, we called for them to engage and advance to the base of the walls,
　　but not one person came. Meanwhile,
　　[someone] grabbed the wall and died in battle. We were also in danger
　　so we sustained minor wounds. Moreover, all the men that both persons had brought with them
　　became wounded or dead, so we withdrew.

　1. Among Tachibana Hida-no-kami's men, there was not a single
　　wounded or dead person.

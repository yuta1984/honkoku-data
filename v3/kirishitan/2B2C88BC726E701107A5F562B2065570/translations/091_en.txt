The position was received. There are fortunately two attack routes. The siege works are also being urgently constructed.

Recorded in the Shimabara Chronicle

Since I am sending a report to Edo, I write this brief note. The situation here remains unchanged from what I reported yesterday.

1. The besieging forces here are not in a condition to receive additional reinforcements, so I have ordered that siege works be constructed with utmost urgency.

1. Regarding the preservation of Lord Naizen's corpse, it was sent to Shimabara last night, where it will be cremated.

1. Yesterday's situation with Lord Naizen and myself should not cause you concern. Although this is a national campaign, the total number of troops is insufficient, which is an unavoidable predicament.

1. Both Lord Naizen and I had our spears broken, and could only fight with the butt ends.

1. There is nothing left of Lord Mondo's position. Since the place where Lord Naizen and I went differs from his, Lord Mondo never dreamed of Lord Naizen's fate. I would like to provide more details, but I am distressed by my father's death, so I report hastily. With fear and reverence.

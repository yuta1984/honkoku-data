His second son Sakichi (marginal note: later called Takebei) was a person whose courage and strength were well known. At first, he followed his father's trail to cross the Takebashi bridge, but while removing the sheath of his spear, he lost sight of his father Sagenta. From there, he split through the allied forces of Yamazaki Tarobei from the first unit with the stone butt of his spear and advanced. Then Shirai Jinzaemon grabbed Itou's armor sleeve and said, "Let us fight together," so he replied, "Then let us go together," and finally broke through Yamazaki's unit to reach the base of the wall on the right front. At this time it was still dark and the timing of arrival at the base of the wall was not clear, but these two men would serve as the vanguard. Later, Sakichi had sand thrown into both eyes but without looking left or right,

since all allies had withdrawn, Sakichi hurriedly jumped down from the platform, but there was no place to set foot due to the wounded and dead lying collapsed everywhere. Thinking his father Sagenta might be there, he searched around in various directions, and when he later returned to the hatamoto, Arima Naiki was positioned on elevated ground and asked, "Who is it that has retreated here?" He answered, "It is Itou Sakichi." "I witnessed your fighting spirit. Also, what were you doing walking around from here to Komi?" he asked. "I was searching for my father Sagenta," he replied. "In that case, did you happen to see Lord Arima?" "I did not see the lord," he answered, and followed behind Naiki back to the main camp.

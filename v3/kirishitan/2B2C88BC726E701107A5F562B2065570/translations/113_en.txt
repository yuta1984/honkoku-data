By order of Toda Samon, Terasawa Hyōgo-no-kami brought soldiers from Ōshima within Amakusa. As an envoy from above (jōshi), Kanematsu Yagozaemon departed Edo on the 25th day of the 12th month and arrived today.

According to the Amakusa Military Record, Terasawa Hyōgo-no-kami Katataka also participated in the campaign at Amakusa without objection, and on the 6th day of the 1st month was ordered to join the battle at Arima. In last winter's battle, many of his men were killed in action, and the number of troops he currently leads appears to be only a small remnant. Matsukura Nagato-no-kami reported that due to repeated battles in which he lost many retainers, it would be difficult to serve in defensive positions or vanguard duties. By order of the envoy from above, it was commanded that [his forces] should be replaced with Hosokawa troops, and immediately the pursuit and vanguard units were exchanged, with forces under Higo-no-kami taking over the front lines and beginning siege works.

Although Nagato-no-kami's petition seemed presumptuous, the substance that his retainers had been killed, the remaining men were all severely wounded, and many were in unknown condition between life and death, making it quite difficult to engage in battle, was truthful.

It is also recorded that Tōshū (Toda Samon) inspected the area outside the castle, thoroughly investigated the state of the siege, and issued orders based on his assessment: "We have been contemptuous of this castle rebellion, treating it lightly, and everyone has been negligent until now. Henceforth, we should simply construct siege works, use bamboo shields, portable shields, and long-range firearms to keep the castle defenders in check, surround the castle without incident, and ensure that the rebels naturally become exhausted." This message was conveyed to all the besieging forces.

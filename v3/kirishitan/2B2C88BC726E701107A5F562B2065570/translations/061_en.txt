"Please be at ease," he said, and indeed he did not go back on these words. Furthermore, two of Tadasato's retainers, Akashi Mataemon and Shibuya Kozaemon, had previously engaged in an argument, but both adhered to the shogunate's prohibitions, suppressed their anger, and promised that if they survived and returned to camp, they would settle their dispute in Kurume. However, at this time, both were struck by gunfire while serving in the vanguard of the hatamoto forces and died together in battle. In addition to these, various daimyo and lesser samurai - some attacking the arrow slits with spears, others thrusting down enemies who shot arrows at them - all displayed military valor beyond count. However, the castle defenders spared no effort to hold their lives dear and firmly defended the interior of the walls, making it unexpectedly difficult to break through. Moreover, confusion arose among their own forces and the lower-ranking soldiers had already begun to retreat. But since Tadasato had positioned his headquarters nearby, he reorganized the vanguard forces. Tadasato dispatched Furukawa Yasudayu, head of his gunners, to Arima Naiki with the message: "Attack and break through the castle swiftly. If the vanguard forces become exhausted, reinforce them with fresh hatamoto troops." Naiki received this message and replied, "There is no need to await further instructions - I shall charge into the castle immediately. There is no cause for concern." At this time, the vanguard soldiers positioned below the walls faced Yasudayu, and while they were calling out their names to each other, someone unknown asked "Are you not Furukawa Yasudayu?" - this was Nimura Jinbei, who called out loudly.

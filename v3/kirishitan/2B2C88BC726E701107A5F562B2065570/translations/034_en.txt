Uchiyama Hanzaemon fought with utmost effort, and though each was wounded, they threw themselves onto the bamboo bundles and the three men mentioned withdrew together to the main camp.

Also, Ishigai Jūzō personally donned armor and took up his spear, exerting all his strength to reach the base of the wall, where the castle defenders aligned their spear points and fought defensively. Finally, Jūzō had his spear broken and, wounded, retreated. His retainers Yuguchi Kakudayū, Murase Shirōbei, Takano Jinbei, Kurosawa Jitadayū, and Ishigai Sebei were also wounded.

Also, Matsudaira Jinsaburō fought but was injured and withdrew to the main camp.

Also, Itakura Mondo, with only a small force, urged Matsuura Nagato-no-kami that his rear guard should prepare to attack quickly, but since Nagato-no-kami advanced carelessly without proper caution, Mondo immediately charged first through the middle of Matsuura's formation. At that time, his retainer Katō Genzaemon, carrying the war banner, led the advance but was immediately killed when struck by gunfire. Ingai Sadayū fought with his spear, and Yoneyama Yohei seized that war banner and again advanced to the front. Following this, forty samurai advanced with equal valor, but this point of attack was particularly difficult to breach, with especially high banks and strong walls. The castle defenders dropped massive stones and fired guns, causing numerous deaths and injuries among the total attacking force. Given today's situation, it appeared difficult to capture this castle. Ishigai Jūzō, wounded in his left hand, sent word to the general headquarters that they should withdraw quickly.

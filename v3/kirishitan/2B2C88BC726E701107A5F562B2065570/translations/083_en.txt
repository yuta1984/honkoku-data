People do not know this at all, thinking him to be a learned scholar - what an
　difficult matter to settle this is.

Recorded in the Yukoki (Record of Brave Deeds)
　　We respectfully report the following. First, we humbly offer our New Year's congratulations.
　　Regarding the Christian rebels who have gathered at Arima Castle for the pacification
　　of this region, we launched an attack from the Hour of the Tiger to the Hour of the Rabbit on New Year's Day.
　　Itakura Naizen joined the various forces, giving orders and
　　running about, when he was struck by gunfire, suffered severe wounds, and died in battle on the spot.
　　All forces fought with even greater determination, but since the vanguard was entirely
　　wounded or killed in large numbers, it became difficult to break through today,
　　so all forces first withdrew to the camp. Furthermore, we ourselves

　　also sustained some wounds, and therefore could not perform our duties adequately, which is
　　most regrettable. We will report the details at a later time. With utmost respect and fear.

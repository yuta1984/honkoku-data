Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami, Nabeshima Shinano-no-kami, and Arima Genba-no-kami ascended to the castle and received instructions at the O-hakushoin (White Study Hall) from Kamon-no-kami, Ōi-no-kami, Sanuki-no-kami, and Bungo-no-kami. The purport was to convey in detail the shogun's intention to dispatch Inoue Chikugo-no-kami to Shimabara in Kyūshū the following day.

Urgent reports from the Shimabara front and from Funai in Bungo were delivered by relay couriers from the Osaka garrison guards, arriving very late at night in succession.

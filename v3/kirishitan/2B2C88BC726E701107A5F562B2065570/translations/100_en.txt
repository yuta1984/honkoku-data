Moreover, there were no commercial goods available, causing great inconvenience. Regarding this matter as well, Izu-no-kami issued orders: "Let the townspeople from neighboring provinces bring all manner of commercial goods to Hara Castle to conduct trade," commanding them to come quickly with this proclamation. Consequently, various merchants brought diverse goods, set up stalls in makeshift town-like structures, and conducted business in a manner that appeared just like the capital. On the sea, ships were brought close to the water's surface and attacked with firearms, creating a scene resembling warfare on land. During the night, when night attacks would be launched from within the castle, forces were to be divided into separate units to respond, with flanking attacks from the sides. When night raids emerged, large bells were to be struck, and upon hearing these bells, all forces were to ring their bells as well - this was proclaimed nightly. Bells were placed with each unit.

Also, bridges were removed from the third bailey, shields were planted by each group of men, and they gradually pressed forward to capture positions. Various shields were procured from different locations. When abundant shields arrived, they were distributed to all forces - 500 or 300 shields each according to their stipend levels. The daimyo lords of the vanguard said, "What if the young men from the hatamoto [direct retainers] were to lead the charge?" To this, Izu-no-kami replied, "Regarding young men charging ahead from behind, even my own son Kai-no-kami shall not be allowed to advance first - you may capture the castle at your own discretion," and this was promised.

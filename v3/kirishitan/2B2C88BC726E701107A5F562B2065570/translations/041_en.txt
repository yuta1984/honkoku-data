For this reason, those who withdrew later appeared more magnificent. The reason was that they observed the condition of those who had withdrawn first and retreated toward places with better footing, so their conduct appeared admirable.

It is also said that Matsudaira Jinzaburō was also on the right wing, and feeling it regrettable that Jūzō had preceded him, he remained beneath the wall, where he was shot in the leg by musket fire and became unable to retreat.

It is also said that Matsudaira Aki-no-kami's messenger Oyamada Kuranosuke, Kuroda Uemon-no-suke's messenger Tsubo'uchi Shōuemon, and Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami's messengers Itō Jūnosuke and Yokoyama Sukenoshin - these men were attached to Itakura, and all of them died incomparable deaths in battle. Matsudaira Nagato-no-kami's messenger, a man called Kunishi Shimōsa-no-kami, left honor behind and served as rear guard in the withdrawal. As he led his dōshin foot soldiers and withdrew very quietly from beneath the wall, there were numerous wounded and dead among the foot soldiers. He had all the wounded and dead carried along and withdrew in good order, which impressed all who witnessed it.

The Shimabara Rebellion Matsukura Record states that Lord Itakura Naizen-no-shō's death poem was:
Last year today I tied the cords of my court cap, this year today I tie the cords of my armor - truly this is the way of a changing world, I go forth to battle immediately

The flower that blooms ahead in the New Year...

In addition, various unit commanders of his personal guard, along with senior pages, child pages, middle pages, and foot soldiers—totaling more than 1,500 people—formed Tadakuni's banner guard. More than 3,500 men of the advance guard formed battle lines facing the castle. Perhaps sensing this general assault, those in the castle chanted in unison what they called "bungyō," some kind of religious recitation of their sect, their voices sounding like a great wind.

According to records from the Nabeshima family, on the last day of the twelfth month, Lord Naizen and Lord Jūkura communicated to all units: "Because the fall of the rebel stronghold has been delayed, there has been a directive from Edo, and another official envoy is to be dispatched. The castle must be taken before the envoy arrives. Therefore, for tomorrow's first day castle attack, the assault positions are determined as follows: from the second bailey to Matsuyama will be Shinano-no-kami's attack route, while the Hinoeguchi route will have Arima Hyōbu-taifu, Matsukura Nagato-no-kami, and Tachibana Sakon-shōgen as the pursuing force's attack route."

According to Matsudaira family records, there were rumors that Matsudaira Izu-no-kami would soon come to Arima-hara Castle as an official envoy, and initially he was to come as the commanding general. Itakura Naizen-no-shō thought: "Since Izu-no-kami is a prominent retainer and the senior retainers are coming with Izu-no-kami, Naizen-no-shō's authority would not extend to them. If that were the case, it would be inappropriate for Naizen-no-shō to remain." Thinking this, on the last day of the year before the general assault planned for New Year's Day of the 15th year of Kan'ei (Year of the Tiger), he summoned all the senior retainers of the combined forces.

Everything was removed, and when we took possession, there were no siege works (shiyose) remaining whatsoever.

According to the memoir of the Matsudaira clan: Matsudaira Izu-no-kami and his son, along with Toda Samon and his son, served as commanders and arrived at Hara Castle on the fourth day of the first month. Therefore, the soldiers of all forces gained strength. Particularly when Izu-no-kami arrived, he immediately ordered all forces to construct sturdy palisades. These palisades were equipped with firearms, and the command was given that if the rebels emerged, they should be shot down with firearms and driven back into the castle to be killed. He issued orders stating that it was unnecessary for peasants and high-ranking samurai to engage in battle. The soldiers of all forces gained strength and their morale changed completely. Additionally, provisions were distributed to all forces at the rate of four men's rations per hundred koku to the entire army.

With all these measures, our allied forces increased without limit. He was praised as an exceptional commander, the likes of which had never been seen in ancient times.

It also states: When Matsudaira Izu-no-kami arrived at Hara Castle on the fourth day of the first month, he immediately issued the following orders: When the rebels took refuge in Hara Castle, they burned their own supplies and brought all foodstuffs into the castle, making provisions difficult for the besieging forces. Therefore, Izu-no-kami ordered the nearby daimyo lords: "Procure all available rice from your domains without delay." As a result, within four or five days, countless rice ships arrived, and immediately four men's rations per hundred koku were distributed to all forces. The total strength of the besieging forces is said to have reached 120,000.

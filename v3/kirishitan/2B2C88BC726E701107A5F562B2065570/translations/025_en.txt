The document written on paper above bears the inscription "Matsukura Nagato-no-kami-dono's household."

This time, regarding the people of this island each struggling with letters, concerning what was said about spring coming, we have come to rely on Nokare Kanenshiro-dono in this manner. Among the 12,200 spear-bearing warriors in the castle as shown in the written records, if you would conduct a leisurely investigation so that we might somehow make even a small petition, this would come to pass, and everyone says this would be satisfactory.

Now there is nothing to be done, and in this state we desire no fief. Also desiring no country, we struggle desperately with letters. Regarding this matter, the people of this island, due to these circumstances, have involved even us, causing tremendous trouble as we fight desperately at the cost of our lives, so I believe our people will be completely exhausted.

For about twenty days now, stone fire arrows and muskets have been falling like rain, but they have not hit their targets. Therefore, thanks to the divine protection of Teras (the Lord), we rejoice all the more. You should inquire of those who shot from the ships about the sign that nothing hits. It is like ants going to a tower - there should be no one who has seen people being hit. This is always a mysterious thing.

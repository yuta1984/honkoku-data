Also, according to (the Amakusa War Chronicle), Itakura Mino-no-kami requested through Ishitani Jūzō to serve as the vanguard, but Naizennokami did not agree. Instead, Mino-no-kami was ordered to join Nagato-no-kami's unit and participate in the assault. Nagato-no-kami was the guardian of this region, and (the rebels) were the root of the uprising. Tomorrow, New Year's Day, would be the crucial moment to either die in battle or capture the castle - they must fight with this determination.

Be prepared for this." The lower ranks

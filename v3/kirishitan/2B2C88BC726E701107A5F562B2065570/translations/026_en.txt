The above two letters were rolled together, covered with paper on top, and shot out toward the artificial hill on the beach side on the last day of December.

According to the memorandum of Nishimura Gohei: On New Year's Eve of December at the Kohama field camp in Shimabara, at the evening hour of six, everyone had gathered at Takumi's hut for the year-end when word came from Arima to Hida that they were ordered to storm the castle on New Year's Day. If they did not arrive at that place during the night, they would not be in time. Takumi said to depart immediately and prepare accordingly. Everyone returned to their huts and came out as soon as they finished their preparations. Since Takumi had already departed early, they gradually caught up with him.

Also recorded: From Kohama to Arima, crossing properly over eight ri, there had been heavy rain the previous day, and that night there was heavy snow. The roads were bad and extremely dark. Encountering a blizzard, the forces were split in two. Four samurai accompanied Takumi, while the remaining men spent the night on top of the old castle at Mono. His own armor, horse, and a few retainers remained with the rear guard. For the New Year's Day castle assault, he himself went out wearing only a chest protector.

According to the Amakusa Diary of Matsudaira Kai-no-kami Teritsuna: On New Year's Eve, at Iizuka in Chikuzen <<Marginal note: From here to Harada is a distance of seven ri and eight chō; this section is called Hiyamizu Pass and has mountains>>, Kuroda Kai-no-kami and Ichishō met face to face on the post road.

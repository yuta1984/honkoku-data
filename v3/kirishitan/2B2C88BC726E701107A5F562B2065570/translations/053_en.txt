where they had positioned their forces and were waiting, he retrieved his father's corpse and withdrew to the camp. Among the officials (jōshi), Naizen-shō was killed in action, while Jūzō and Jinsaburō were wounded. The other officials suffered no particular incidents.

According to another account, in the second assault, Matsuura Nagato-no-kami's forces also attacked up to the third bailey, but they too could not hold their position for even a moment and fled back to the valley rice fields behind them. Among the rōnin there were some capable men, but Nagato-no-kami himself, though a distinguished lord of high rank who had received generous rewards for his forces' excellent performance and achievements during the Siege of Osaka, found his troops becoming cowardly at Hara Castle. It has been said since ancient times that whether for good or ill, everything depends on the general, and this truly seemed to be the case.

According to yet another account, Nabeshima's forces also made an assault but could not break into the castle, fleeing into the deep rice paddies behind and becoming covered in mud. The Kyushu foot soldiers and laborers who witnessed the scene on New Year's Day clapped their hands and laughed loudly, saying, "The state of these high-ranking samurai with their stipends is more pitiful than that of peasants!" The various weapons and bamboo shields, and also near the walls where corpses could not be retrieved, weapons and bamboo shields were taken by those who came out from the castle to exchange them.

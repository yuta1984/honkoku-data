To Lord Itakura Suō-no-kami
Recorded in the Memorandum on the Christian Uprising
　　I humbly write to you. Today, on New Year's Day, when a general assault was ordered,
　　we could not break through, and moreover there were very many wounded and killed. Since the various forces
　　also made futile efforts, the troops were first withdrawn. Lord Itakura
　　Naizen was killed in battle. Lord Ishitani Jūzō was wounded, but
　　it is a minor matter. Matsudaira Jinzaburō and we
　　two or three others joined another's forces, where Jinzaburō was
　　wounded by gunfire, but this too is a minor matter.
　　I report this in great haste. Written with fear and respect.

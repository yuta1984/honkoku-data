He said this and led them up to the artificial hill, attacking toward that detached fort's ground and the ridge of the castle mountain. "This requires climbing only a single wall, and while the valley has no concern for flanking fire, they have built up the ground with earthworks above which stands a wall. If we climb up there, when we scale it, there will be both earthworks and walls - a double barrier. Even if arranged like this and we are pushed back by the defenders, ultimately we can concentrate our assault on one section of the wall," he explained, then returned to the instruction hut. At that point, a man named Miura Jūemon came and said, "Yesterday I wanted to bring a hand-shield but did not possess one. I assume you have had some prepared, so I have come to request one."

Sōzaemon replied, "That would be simple, but until just now we had many, which we sent out due to others' requests. Apart from those,

we have kept only the number needed for my son and myself. It is most regrettable that you have come a bit late." When Miura said, "I had definitely counted on getting a shield, but if that's the case, it cannot be helped" and started to leave, Sōzaemon said, "Miura appears to have deep commitment, so let us put him to good use first," called him back, and gave him one shield. Miura was extremely pleased and returned home. However, on the way he suddenly remembered: "Success in battle depends on each person's performance in the moment, so the outcome is impossible to predict with certainty. I have carelessly accepted this hand-shield, but if it proves useless and I lose face afterward, I should just return it." Yet thinking, "No, no, returning it now would be even more inappropriate," he pondered and took it back to his own hut, as he later related.

Dōmyō Koheiji and townsman Mumoku Zaemon - these eighteen men in total. Itō Han'emon was a dōshin-gashira (head of patrol officers), but all the ashigaru (foot soldiers) of his unit were away in Edo. Katayama Magodayū and Kimura Yaheiji had both been standing guard at this location from before. Magodayū was about eighty years old at that time, but here he performed the ichiban-yari (first spear attack), struck down two men, and while wiping the blood from his spear, he had served in the vanguard during a river crossing under Tanaka Chikugo-no-kami's advance guard, but because his status was obscured he had not reported it, yet today too he performed the first spear attack. Yaheiji defended for a while, but when the enemy took his spear and the spearmen were also wounded, thinking that close combat would be impossible, he went to retrieve a spear, but

withdrew partway through. Shōshichi said to Yaheiji: "Did you withdraw after having your spear taken? I shall retrieve it!" He called out his challenge and took the enemy's spear. That day he was shot straight through the chest with a gun, but still did not withdraw, so the remaining men said "By all means!" and sent him to the watchtower. While the enemy was retreating, they caught up and came to the gate again, saying that since there was nothing to be done in the watchtower, and it was a good place to die, perhaps they should die there. After the enemy withdrew, Shinbei said: "Indeed, you have defended well. Everyone's performance was incomparable." Now, at the rear attack point (搦手), there were only two men - Shiotsuka Kazaemon and Naruse Gen'emon - so I said that we brothers should go there.

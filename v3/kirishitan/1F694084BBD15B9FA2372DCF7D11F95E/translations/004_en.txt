and went to their deaths without concern. Finally, they formed an alliance with Matsuemon, Taniemon, Magoemon, Zenemon, and Sōi and others to plot rebellion. In the winter month of the year Teichū (1637), they repaired the abandoned Arima castle and occupied it. The bandits numbered nearly forty thousand. Thereupon Matsudaira Nobutsuna and Toda Ujikane, following imperial orders, led the armies of the western provinces to surround them, and by the second month of spring in the year Boin (1638), they completely annihilated the bandits and the calamitous rebellion was quelled. Now, when the Qing dynasty dealt with the Zunghars and Jinchuan, they had strategic records numbering in the tens to hundreds of volumes, thoroughly documenting these events for inclusion in the official histories. Our campaign against the bandits during the Kan'ei era, when compared to those Zunghar and Jinchuan incidents, bears considerable similarity in nature. Therefore, our national history should also have a complete written record, yet there is none. While there happen to be books such as "Record of Divine Punishment of the Jesuits," "Record of Universal Manifestation of Governance," and "Tales of Amakusa," these are merely small pamphlets, insufficient to fully cover these events.

《Marginal note: Ryōrei》I privately worry about this situation, so I have excerpted from the private records and family genealogies of various houses concerning military affairs of that time, and from miscellaneous writings and records that touch upon these matters, taking them as supplementary material. I compile and record them day by day, intending to create a strategic record of the pacification of the Christian sectarian bandits.

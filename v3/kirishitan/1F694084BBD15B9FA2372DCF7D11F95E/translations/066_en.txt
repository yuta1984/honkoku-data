The villages involved were Sankai village, Higashi-Kuga village, Ono village, Yuguchi village, Tahira
village, and Tsuchiguro village. The magistrates were Kondo Genzaemon, Okazaki Denzaemon,
Sena Shichiroemon, and ashigaru commander Nagaya Sukezaemon—these four
served as leaders, along with Hanabusa Shichiroebe, Ikuma Sukenosuke, the same Judayu,
and Okamura Gentaro—eight men in total. As the enemy pressed forward at the western gate, they had
the people from these villages bring weapons and went out to meet them. In battle with the enemy at a distance of about three cho,
Ikuma Sukenosuke alone charged straight forward in attack. The enemy saw this
and aimed at Sukenosuke, with four or five men rushing out, and they
engaged in combat on the battlefield. Though Sukenosuke fought well, since the opponents were numerous, he was struck
down and killed in battle. Nagaya Sukezaemon, Seto Shichiroemon,

and Ikuma's son Judayu continued the charge, and of the enemy who had killed Sukenosuke,
they killed two men. Because of this, the enemy withdrew to the rear, and though in this kind of skir-
mishing others were also killed, the main enemy force neither attacked nor
fired guns. At that point, the men from Sankai village who were positioned with our allies
pretended to attack the enemy but turned toward the rear and fired guns at them.
They charged together with the mountain rebels. Seeing this, the men
from the villages positioned with our allies fled toward their home villages, each trying to be first.
Because of this, the samurai quickly withdrew and shut themselves in the castle.
Also, half of Himizu-ishi village joined the South Arima village rebels, with village head
Okura as their standard bearer, setting fire to magistrate Takahashi Buemon at [unclear temple name]

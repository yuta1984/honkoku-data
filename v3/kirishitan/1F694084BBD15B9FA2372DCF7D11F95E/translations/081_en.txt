When the lord's retainer Densuke unexpectedly arrived, [Sōzaemon] said "This is perfect" and immediately took him as a hostage. Sōbei said "I will quickly arrange the boat matter" and tried to send him away, but since Densuke had been taken hostage, perhaps thinking of his child, he immediately prepared the boat.

At that time, Densuke's father Sōbei said, "Since we have been acquainted for many years, and these are dangerous times making me uneasy, I would like to send sixty leading men in a separate boat as escorts." Sōzaemon replied, "Such arrangements are unnecessary," and departed, whereupon two boats equipped with bows and firearms took positions flanking Sōzaemon's boat and accompanied them.

For this purpose He prepared the path of the Passion, yet since He still does not cease all chastisement, if there were no path of salvation, there should be no distinction between angels and humans. This is clear evidence that God's divine law is strict.

Furthermore, what else could He employ other than sending down God's only Son and having Him give up His life as compensation for abolishing our sins? Could there be any divine law or righteous path surpassing this? When our Savior Christ bore the cross, the words He spoke to the good women who followed Him weeping and lamenting should truly be known as a subject of fear. In Luke 15: "O daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For the days shall come when they shall say, 'Blessed are the barren wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.' Then they shall say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.' For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?" The meaning of this is: if even Christ, who has no sin, endures such severe suffering for human sins, what will become of those sunk in sin? Thus, if He executes such divine law even when bestowing the supreme and boundless mercy through these words, what will it be like when He does not extend His compassion?

If you are foolish and cannot reach this understanding, then at least [consider] the sufferings of Inferno...

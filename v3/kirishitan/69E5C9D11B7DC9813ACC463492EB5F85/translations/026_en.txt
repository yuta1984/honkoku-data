If this is so, then see that God desires great atonement in order to save and forgive mankind. As Saint John Chrysostom says, "It is difficult for a person to make atonement for that day's sins on that same day. Likewise, it is difficult to repay that day's debts immediately on that same day." Based on this, how can you think to repay the atonement for the sins you have shouldered throughout your lifetime only after you have grown old? There is no rebellion against God greater than this, as Saint Gregory has revealed. Truly, after one's years have declined, even the atonement for present sins would be completely difficult to perform, yet those who rely on His mercy and postpone the path of rising to goodness go against the true intention of thinking of God. Therefore, they should deeply fear Him, quickly return to God, and beseech His grace for the sake of good works.

Even if one does not personally experience the dangers of the aforementioned conditions, faced with the limitless heavenly grace and the immeasurable heavenly joy that He has promised, how could any person of sound judgment begrudge time in the path of serving Him? In Ecclesiasticus it appears: "Never grow weary in doing good, for your reward is eternal and endless." Faced with such profoundly deep reward, why would you try to shorten the time of serving Him? Since the reward means a body that should live long under God's limitless heavenly reign, why should you begrudge this world's limited, dewdrop-like life in the path of serving Him? When you cannot even completely offer an entire lifetime of the endless world, and can barely offer a third of it, what does this mean? Still, even this aforementioned grace...

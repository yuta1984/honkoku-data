I think this is truly the foremost insight. In Confucianism, they call the desires of temperament "human mind" (jinxin) and thinking about moral principles "moral mind" (daoxin). In this regard, the Confucian school has also exhausted goodness and perfected beauty. This is not something that can be reached by the crooked theories of Christians or barbarians.

The state of non-arising of a single thought is the wondrous substance of the immovable mind-king. The arising of selfish desire in a single thought is intention. Furthermore, elaborately working with distinctions like green and red is called consciousness. For example, though it is the same fire, it is like the three aspects of fire, flame, and blaze. Therefore, not knowing these principles that have been so thoroughly explained by various schools, yet putting on airs and speaking of "anima sensitiva" and "anima rationalis" like Chinese nonsense to deceive ignorant people is wickedness.

However, there are not two or three principles, but only one principle. The differences in function follow the various categories of phenomena. The uniform rain represents principle, while the myriad different vessels represent phenomena. For example, when heaven naturally sends down rain, various vessels are brought out to receive it. The rainwater has no characteristics of long or short, square or round, no fragrant or foul odors, no distinction of pure or turbid, and no tastes such as sweet or bitter. Yet the square, round, five flavors, fragrances, foul odors, pure and turbid, etc.

all follow the square, round, good, evil, pure, and defiled nature of the vessels themselves. Thus, the endowed nature (fumei) is also like this - due to differences in the purity, turbidity, thickness, and thinness of temperament, their functions are not the same. Why would one divide this principle separately into "vegetative," "sensitive," "rational," and so forth? Particularly, since the human mind is called "anima rationalis" (rational soul) and is considered a separate entity, the various schools do not understand that controlling bodily desires is the ultimate principle.

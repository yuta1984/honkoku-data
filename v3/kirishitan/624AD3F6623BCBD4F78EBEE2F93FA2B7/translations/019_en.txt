Nevertheless, there are not two or three principles, but only one principle. The differentiation in function follows the various categories of phenomena. The uniform rain represents principle; the myriad different vessels represent phenomena. For example, when heaven sends down rain, various vessels are brought out to receive it. The rainwater has no characteristics of length or shortness, square or round shape, no fragrant or foul odor, no distinction of pure or turbid, no taste of sweet or bitter, yet the square or round shape, five flavors, fragrant or foul odors, pure or turbid qualities, etc.

all follow the square or round shape, good or evil, pure or impure nature of the vessels themselves. Therefore, the endowed nature (fumei) is also like this. Due to the differences in the purity or turbidity, thickness or thinness of material temperament, the functions are also not the same. Why then divide the principle separately into vegetative, sensitive, rational, and so forth? Especially since the human mind is called anima rationalis and is a distinct entity, the idea that controlling bodily desires is the ultimate principle is not understood by the various schools.

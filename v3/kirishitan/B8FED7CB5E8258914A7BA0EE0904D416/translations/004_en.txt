　　　　Record of the Foreigner's Statement

One: I am from Rome within the country of Italy. My name is Giovanni Battista Sidotti. I am forty-one years old.

One: I am a cleric who serves as a teacher of the Roman Catholic faith.

One: In my homeland, my mother is still alive. I have brothers who are also clerics of the same faith as myself. I also have a sister. My father has died. I have no wife or children.

One: I, as a cleric of the Catholic faith, was ordered by the religious leader called Pope Innocent XII six years ago to cross the sea to Japan in order to spread the Catholic faith. During that time, I learned to speak Japanese, and about three years ago in early July, I departed from Rome. At that time, a fellow cleric named Thomas de Ro Tan was also sent by the Pope's command to Beijing in China, and he departed Rome together with me. We traveled in a fleet of two small galleon ships, stopped at Yaneri Island in the Canary Islands, and then went to a place called Canaria.

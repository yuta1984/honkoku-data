This work is named ☩ Doutrina Christam (Christian Doctrine). This means the teachings of Christianity. In order to easily make this content known to all people, high and low, the language is close to common ears, while the principles fathom the depths of Heaven's mandate.

○Therefore, in order to quickly discern reason, it is structured as a dialogue between teacher and disciple. Thus, this ☩ Doutrina is the sole path of spiritual peace and certainty for all Christians, so it is essential that everyone knows and understands it.

In doing so, one should escape the darkness of delusion and be grounded in true light.

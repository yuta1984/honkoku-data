...are there?

Master: It is not such a matter. There is only one who resides in heaven.

Disciple: Then when people are in distress, why do they invoke her in various ways, such as "Mother of Mercy," or "She who grants miraculous power," or "She who brings joy to those who sorrow"?

Master: There is no other reason. Simply because the Mother's intercession is well-received before Deus, and as she is the "Mother of Mercy," she bestows various graces from above, therefore we invoke her in this manner.

Disciple: To whom should we direct the Ave Maria prayer?

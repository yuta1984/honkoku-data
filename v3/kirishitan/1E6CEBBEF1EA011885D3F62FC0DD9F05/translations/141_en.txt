Master: Christians who have sufficient wisdom to understand and revere that our Lord Jesus Christ is present in the holy Eucharist should all receive the Eucharist once a year, following the bishop's proclamation before and after Easter. However, this should be done with the consent of one's confessor.

Disciple: How should one understand the fourth commandment?

Master: Unless one has such physical ailments that would make fasting harmful to one's health, all Christians aged twenty-two and under should observe fasting during Lent, as well as on the days of fasting prescribed by the Church.

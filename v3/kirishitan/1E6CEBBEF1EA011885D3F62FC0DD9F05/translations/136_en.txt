Disciple: What should we understand about the second mandament (commandment)?

Master: All Christians of an age to discern good from evil should, according to the ordinances of the Ecclesia (Church), make confession at least once a year when there is a priest available to hear their confisan (confession). However, if there is no priest present, or if it is not possible to have one's confession heard, then failing to make confession does not constitute a violation of this mandament.

Disciple: Why do you say "at least once a year"?

Master: The Santa Ecclesia (Holy Church) desires that just as we frequently fall into sin, we should also frequently make confession.

The wine appears only as wine - there is no separate ritual for this. Since the color, taste, and fragrance remain as they originally were, only bread and wine are visible to the eye. However, through the light of faith, we believe that under the appearance and form of bread and wine, there is no longer the substance of bread and wine. There is only the direct body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Disciple: What does it mean when it is said that the body of Jesus Christ exists under the color and taste of bread, and His blood exists under the color and taste of wine? Does this mean that the body of Jesus Christ in the Host is separated from His blood in the Chalice?

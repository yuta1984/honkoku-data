Disciple: Why are these sins collectively called mortal sins?

Master: Although these are generally all called mortal sins, depending on the circumstances, they often become venial sins.

Disciple: What is the reason they are called "mortal"?

Master: "Mortal" means to bestow death. The life of the soul is received and inherited from God's grace. Mortal sins are called "mortal" because they cut off the life of the soul. However, since the true nature of the soul is something that never ends, even though it receives death, do not think that it has an end at that time. It is simply called "death" referring to the place where one suffers eternally.

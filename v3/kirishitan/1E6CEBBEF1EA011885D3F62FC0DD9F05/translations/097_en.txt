Deus (God) begets His Son through the vast and boundless entendimento (understanding/intellect) of the spiritual Deus that transcends nature. This mystery is beyond the reach of human frail wisdom.

Disciple: Could you not reveal this mystery somewhat through parables?

Master: Though inadequate, I shall give one parable. Just as when we face a mirror, our reflection appears upon it, so when our Lord Deus turns toward the Atere's (Father's) essential nature and all virtues and goodness through His entendimento (intellect), like a reflection appearing in a mirror, He brings forth One who possesses the same substantia (substance) and is equal to Him in all things.

[we] honor and revere [God]. Second, by witnessing the reverence shown to the saints that Santa Ecclesia (Holy Church) celebrates here below, we come to understand the greatness of their glory in heaven. Third, by knowing the saints' ascetic practices and virtues, and since they were human beings like us, we should learn from their meritorious deeds. Fourth, we should cultivate devotion and rely upon their intercession. Fifth, at the time of their death, because they were children who devoted themselves to merit without regard for their own death before their mother, Santa Ecclesia (Holy Church), we should also venerate them after their death.

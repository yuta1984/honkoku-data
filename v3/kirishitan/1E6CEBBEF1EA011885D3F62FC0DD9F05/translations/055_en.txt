...in order that those actions may become the glory of Deus.

Disciple: What are our enemies?

Master: The world, tengu (demons), and the flesh - these are they.

Disciple: Why are these three things called enemies of mankind?

Master: Though enemies cannot force the soul to commit sins repeatedly, they are called enemies because they can recommend evil and lead one astray into that path.

Disciple: Why does Deus not stop the temptations that arise from those three kinds of enemies?

Master: It is so that by fighting against enemies, one may achieve victory through Deus's divine assistance, and He may grant the reward for that victory.

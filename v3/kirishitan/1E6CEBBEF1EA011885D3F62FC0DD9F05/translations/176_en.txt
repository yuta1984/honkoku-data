By obligation, male children must follow their fathers and endure hardships with stepmothers, while female children must go with their mothers and face whatever difficulties they may encounter with stepfathers. To prevent such deficiencies, without an enduring pledge that lasts forever, it would be impossible to raise those children with true and deep care, free from want. Moreover, when we add further consideration and examine this matter, there should be nothing in this world that escapes this principle. Why is this so? When couples who have made daily pledges to each other separate over trivial matters, or when they transfer their affections to other women or other men, thereby breaking apart their truly established marital bond - can this be called reasonable? This represents the extreme of straying from the proper path.

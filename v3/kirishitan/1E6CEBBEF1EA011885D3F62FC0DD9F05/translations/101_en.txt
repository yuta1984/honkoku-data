also the most fitting way according to divine reason, and thus chose this as the most appropriate path.

Disciple: Please explain in detail the reasoning behind this.

Master: First, it is to make us know the profound and immense depth of His love for us, so that our devotion to Deus (God) may also be deep. Second, it is to make us understand the gravity of sin. For if Deus became human and died to forgive sins, it shows how great His wrath was. Third, it is so that we may contemplate the depth of this grace and offer proper gratitude in return. For if Deus had forgiven us lightly without enduring such suffering, people would not recognize or appreciate His grace so much.

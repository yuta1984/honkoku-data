The good people of old could not ascend to heaven until our Lord's ascension, so they waited at the bottom of the earth for His resurrection. In order to summon up these people, He descended to that place and called forth the souls of those good people from there.

Disciple: What kind of place is the bottom of the earth to which our Lord Jesus Christ's soul descended?

Master: At the bottom of the earth there are four kinds of places. The first bottom is called Inferno (Hell), which is the place where the devil and other sinners who died with grave sins reside. The second is a little above that, called Purgatorio (Purgatory), where the souls of people who died without separating from mortal sins purify the sins they could not complete in this world.

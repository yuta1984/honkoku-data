Master: Using the right hand, one recites the sign of the cross from forehead to chest, from left shoulder to right shoulder. The words recited orally are ☩ "In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, Amen." ○ This means "In the name of Deus Pater, Filius, et Spiritus Sanctus." ☩ When reciting "In nomine Patris," place the hand on the forehead; ☩ when saying "et Filii," touch the chest; ☩ when saying "et Spiritus," touch the left shoulder; when saying "Sancti," place the hand on the right shoulder.

Disciple: What is the purpose of that "Benzeru" invocation?

Master: It is to represent and honor Deus - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - the three Persons who are one God, who created us in His image.

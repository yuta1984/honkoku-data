like dogs that flee in fear upon seeing a raised stick." Saint Gregory, or regarding Jude, declares: even though that person possessed no faith and did not use the cross, but rather scorned it, when he entered a place where many demons had gathered and greatly feared being harmed, because he had previously recited the sign of the cross upon his body, the demons immediately tried to harm him but ultimately could not succeed. If even one who lacks faith could drive away demons by invoking the cross, how much more powerful would it be when Christians invoke it?

Disciple: I have heard the invocation called "Hersiinaru." Please teach me the invocation method called "Benzeru" ☩.

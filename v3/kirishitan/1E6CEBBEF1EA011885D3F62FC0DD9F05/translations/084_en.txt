He was crucified and died, and was buried in the tomb. He descended to the depths of the earth, and on the third day He rose again. He ascended to heaven and sits at the right hand of Deus (God) the Father who fulfills all things. From there He shall descend to judge the living and the dead. [We] truly believe in Santa Ecclesia (Holy Church) where Spiritus Sanctus (Holy Spirit) resides in Catholica (Catholic Church). [We believe in] the communion of Santos (Saints). The forgiveness of sins. The resurrection of the body. Eternal life without end - [these we] truly believe. Amen.

Here, since we are teaching the Creed, it should be expressed in twelve articles. First: to believe in Deus Pater (God the Father) who created heaven and earth and is almighty. Second: to believe in His only Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Third: that He was conceived by the miraculous power of Spiritus Sanctus (the Holy Spirit) and born of Virgen Maria (the Virgin Mary). Fourth: that under Pontius Pilate He suffered, endured, was crucified, died, and was placed in the tomb. Fifth: that He descended to the depths of the earth and rose again on the third day. Sixth: that He ascended to heaven and sits at the right hand of Deus Pater who is almighty. Seventh: that He will righteously judge the living and the dead

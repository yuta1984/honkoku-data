○ Fourth: On the Ave Maria

Disciple: Should we pray only to God?

Master: That is not so. Among the various saints who serve as our intercessors, we also pray to the Virgin Saint Mary, our Mother, who intercedes especially for sinners.

Disciple: Is there an established prayer to be offered to the Virgin Saint Mary?

Master: It is the prayer called Ave Maria. I shall teach it to you now.

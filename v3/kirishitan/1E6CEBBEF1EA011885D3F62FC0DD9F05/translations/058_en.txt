Master: It refers to this physical body with its evil innate nature due to the original sin that was inherited. Moreover, it is so named pointing to the place where evil habits have become abundant due to sins one has committed oneself.

Disciple: How does this flesh promote temptations?

Master: It is that which inclines one toward sin through the evil innate nature and evil habits that exist in the body.

Disciple: What are these evil innate nature and bad habits?

Master: They are the lustful desires that arise in the heart. These are what darken the mind and make it unable to discern evil. Those desires are the body's deep longings, trust, love, hatred, joy, sorrow, fear, anger, and such things.

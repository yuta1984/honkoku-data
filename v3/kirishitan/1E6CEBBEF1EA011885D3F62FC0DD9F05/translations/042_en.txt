Disciple: When people become Christians, what kind of position do they receive?

Master: They become children of the ☩ Heavenly Father, adopted children of Deus, receiving the inheritance of heaven. The reason is that [Deus] intends to elevate those who receive ☩ baptism to this position.

Disciple: What about people who are not Christians?

Master: Because they do not receive ☩ baptism, they are not made adopted children and are kept away from the heavenly inheritance.

Disciple: What is a Christian?

Master: A person who not only receives our Lord Jesus Christ's teachings in their heart through faith, but also expresses them through words.

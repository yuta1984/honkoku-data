corresponds to this in His creation. Therefore, created things do not proceed from His inner nature, but are made from nothing. The reason is that in order to create, He needs no tools, no foundation, no seed, but creates simply by thinking 'Let it be.' For example, when a carpenter intends to build a house, he first holds the blueprint in his understanding, and creates the house according to it. However, the house built outside is not the blueprint within his understanding. Similarly, although Deus (God) creates according to the Ideas of created things that He holds in His understanding, the created things are not those Ideas themselves, but are made from nothing through His omnipotence by which all things are made possible."

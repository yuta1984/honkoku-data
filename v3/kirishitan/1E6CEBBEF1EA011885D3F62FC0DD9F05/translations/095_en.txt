...nature because He gives each its appropriate nature. The proof of this is the individual natures and virtues that appear in created things. However, a stone is not a horse or cow. Created things also follow this principle.

Things that have form are of our own substance derived from the four elements, so while materia (matter) may be of one type, their true essence is distinct for each. The reason is that created things are not made from materia alone, but are made with forma (form). Therefore, even though materia may be of one type, when forma changes, the true essence changes completely.

For example, even though one might make both a horse and a cow from the same wood, because the forma differs, the horse is not a cow. If you wish to understand these matters in greater detail, you should read what is written in the catechism.

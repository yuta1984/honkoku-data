Disciple: What is the way to have mortal sins forgiven?

Master: Sin is an offense against God, therefore one must grieve and sorrow for it, resolve never to commit it again, and be prepared to make confession - grieving and sorrowing for sin with this attitude is called contrition, and this is the way sins are forgiven.

Disciple: What are venial sins?

Master: They are sins lighter than mortal sins. Although they do not cause us to lose God's grace, they make our hearts lukewarm toward God's love and service, and thus become a bridge to mortal sin.

Master: "For anyone who has received Matrimony while their spouse is still alive, it is absolutely not permitted to take another spouse and receive this sacrament anew. However, when one of the married couple dies, it is permitted to receive it again. Additionally, a person who has received the sacrament of Extreme Unction and recovered from that illness may receive it again when facing death another time."

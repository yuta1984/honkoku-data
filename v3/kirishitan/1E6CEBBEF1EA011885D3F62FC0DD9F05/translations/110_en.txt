弟子：What does it mean that the saints of the ninth [article] have communion with us?

師：Since each Christian is a membro (member) of this Ecclesia, there is communion in the power of fides (faith) and sacraments among one another. Also, the saints who reside in heaven and the people in Purgatorio (Purgatory) were once members of this Ecclesia, so we believe there is communion with them as well. This is because our Lord Jesus Christ and the beatos (blessed ones) bestow upon us their intercession and their merits, while our prayers and the power of our charitable works are offered to the anima (souls) in Purgatorio.

Disciple: Jesus Christ's height was that of an ordinary person, so how can He be contained completely in a small Host?

Master: This is an unfathomable mystery (mysterio) of the sacrament, and to forcibly try to understand it is an unnecessary desire. It is essential to simply believe with deep humility. However, with the mirror analogy mentioned above, one can understand it somewhat. As stated above, though a fragment of a broken mirror may be small, what is reflected in it - not only something as tall as a person, but even Mount Tai - can be reflected completely without anything missing.

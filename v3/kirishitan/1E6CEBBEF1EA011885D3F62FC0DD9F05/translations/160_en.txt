When celebrating Mass, the priest recites over the chalice and host the very words that our Lord Jesus Christ directly taught. At that moment, what had been (ordinary) bread instantly transforms into the true body of Jesus Christ, and the wine in the chalice transforms into the true blood of Jesus Christ - this must be believed as essential. Therefore, from that point onward, under the appearance and taste of bread and wine, the true essence of our Lord Jesus Christ is present there just as He is present in heaven. Consequently, just as we would directly worship the sacred body of Jesus Christ, it is essential that we revere this immeasurable sacrament.

"If the matter of the forceful petition is delayed, they will likely come carrying portable shrines again, which would cause disturbance in Kyoto. Orders should be given to Nobunaga quickly." Therefore, through Kazanin Chūnagon Hiromasa, the purport of the mountain gate's petition was commanded to Nobunaga. Although Nobunaga was displeased, he complied with the imperial command and renamed Eiroku-ji to Nanban-ji (Southern Barbarian Temple). He then donated land worth 500 koku in Kōga District of Ōmi Province. The temple's architectural structure and magnificent decorations were astonishing to behold.

Moreover, since Organtino alone was insufficient for missionary work, he was ordered to summon several people from his home country. Organtino was delighted and sent word to his homeland.

Now, the Southern Barbarian Christian countries are called by the country names España (Spain), along with Portugal and Castilla. The distance by sea from Japan is over 12,000 ri, and when viewed on a world map, they are countries located to the west of China and Japan. However, the reason they are called "Southern Barbarians" may be because the dependencies of these countries—such as Macau port and Luzon—are located to the south of Japan, hence the designation "Southern Barbarians." Macau, Luzon, etc. are 800 ri from Japan and are particularly south of Japan. They are not neighboring countries of Spain but are dependencies of that country.

Since Macau, Luzon, and others are islands without governors, Southern Barbarian people often anchor their ships at those islands, and now many Southern Barbarian people travel to and reside there, so they are said to be affiliated countries. There is a country called England neighboring Spain {{marginal note: also called Anglia or Inglaterra}}.

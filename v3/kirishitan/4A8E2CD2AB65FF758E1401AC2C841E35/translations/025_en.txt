came and stayed one night. The mother welcomed him and invited him in, expressing gratitude for the previous gifts, and the guest monk engaged in friendly conversation throughout the night. Baian said: "Generally speaking, the current Buddhist teachings, both of Shakyamuni and Amida, are Buddhist teachings that recognize the inherent nature of ordinary people and call them Buddha. Therefore, in these latter days, their dharmic power has declined, virtue has naturally disappeared, and attaining Buddhahood through today's Buddhist teachings cannot be accomplished at all. The Buddhist teaching of the Heavenly Emperor is a Buddha that appeared at the beginning of chaos, and even now is one with the sun and moon, and moreover, its dharmic power and virtue remain unchanged from the beginning of heaven and earth. I do not know which sect your master follows, but if you wish for Buddhahood in future lives, you should quickly convert and take refuge in the Nanban sect." Thus he eloquently expounded the doctrines of the Heavenly Emperor. However, this mother was a firm adherent of the Nembutsu sect and would not listen to the teachings of other sects. She said to Baian: "Your kind sermon and guidance are most appreciated. However, we have been of the Nembutsu sect for generations, and though there are many sects in the realm today, we do not listen to the doctrines of other sects. We rely solely on Amida's vows, and with the conviction that we have already attained Buddhahood and enlightenment in this world, we know nothing of other matters in Buddhism. Therefore, while your guidance is appreciated, we absolutely cannot abandon Amida's vows at this point." Thus she did not accept Baian's teachings. Originally, Baian intended to draw this mother into the faith through material benefits, thinking that if the mother converted, the Shuri-no-taiyu would also easily be converted.

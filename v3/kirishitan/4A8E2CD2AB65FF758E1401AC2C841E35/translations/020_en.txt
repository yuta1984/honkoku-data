As could be seen, a learned scholar named Furukomu (Fructuoso) who had come from his home country, along with other Padres and Irmãos, arrived in Azuchi. This Furukomu, having first arrived in Nagasaki, had within one year read through all the Buddhist scriptures three times and mastered Buddhist teaching, memorizing the essentials of all the various sects. His overall appearance was as follows: his hair was mouse-colored with a tonsure on top of his head like an inverted bowl. His eyes were round as if wearing spectacles, with a golden color within. His nose was like a turban shell with its spiral removed and attached, his face was like that of a horse, his mouth was wide about five inches across, and his teeth were like horse's teeth. While on horseback, he would stand on his saddle as he rode, produce fire from his fingernails to smoke tobacco, and when he saw crows perched on tree branches, he would advance his horse toward them, but the crows would not move. When he finally broke off a branch to take it, the crows remained motionless as if they were artificial fixtures. Besides this, he performed various magical arts that amazed onlookers with their strangeness. Both sides having arrived in Azuchi, they set a date, and when the appointed time came and the monks of the various sects were seated in rows, the scholars of the Nanban temple took their seats with Furukomu as their debate leader. At that time, Furukomu wore robes of Shu red brocade and girded himself with a sword about two feet long as he advanced forward. From the Buddhist side, Priest In of Nanzen-ji faced him. At that time Furukomu said, "What is the Buddha-dharma?" Priest In answered, "Mind itself is Buddha." Furukomu again said, "What is the profound meaning of 'Mind itself is Buddha'?" The priest again answered, "Mind itself is Buddha

When one arouses this single thought, it is not difficult to take peaks and make them valleys, take seas and make them mountains. They write down this intention, affix a blood seal, and submit it to the ecclesia (church). This is translated as "temple" here. There is also a teaching that makes people arise aspirations. This is called caridade. This is translated as "mutual assistance" (charity). When the national law prohibits this religion, those with firm fides (faith) devote their hearts to the doctrine and abandon their lives to the world. Some suffer the torture of being hung upside down, others face the punishment of fierce fire. At this time, they concentrate single-mindedly on Deus (God) for a moment, receiving torment and enduring suffering. Then Deus takes their place, combining his power with theirs to receive the suffering. Therefore, that person's agony is immediately relieved, and in an instant, they are born in heaven and receive bliss. Thus, those who die in martyrio (martyrdom) have no sin, even if they were to kill their lord or father, because they receive permission from Deus. Since Jesus Christ established this religion, up to this year, Shōhō 5 (1648), it has been approximately 1,647 years.

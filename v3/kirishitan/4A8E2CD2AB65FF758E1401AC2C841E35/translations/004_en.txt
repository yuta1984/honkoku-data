His teeth were white as snow, like a horse's teeth, and his claws resembled those of a bear's paws. His hair was gray-colored, and he appeared to be about fifty years old. His name was Vulcan Bateren, and he was from a Namban Christian country, having come to spread the religious teachings of the Heavenly Emperor (God). Daily he wandered around the sacred shrines and Buddhist temples of Nagasaki, and people gathered in crowds to see his strange appearance. Some drew his unusual features in pictures and recorded them in writing, spreading the news to the Chūgoku region and into the capital. Nobunaga, who was in Azuchi in Ōmi Province, heard of this and wanted to summon and see him, but considering that lord Ryūzōji would try to prevent this, he devised a stratagem. He enlisted a retainer of the Shōgun's house named Sabukaya Gen'nai, secretly forged an official letter supposedly from Yoshiaki summoning the foreigner, and sent Gen'nai as an envoy to the western provinces.

Gen'nai arrived in Kyushu and delivered the official letter to Ryūzōji. When Takashige examined the letter, not knowing it was a forgery, he respectfully and fearfully complied, immediately adding Senke-no-tsukasa Nakanishi Kenmotsu and Sasahara Yazaemon as escorts and sending them up to Kyoto. Nobunaga sent forces to the Yotsuzuka area near Toba to receive them and brought them back to the castle town of Azuchi in Ōmi Province. When Ryūzōji's escort returned and reported to Takashige about Nobunaga's secret plot, Takashige was greatly angered but could do nothing about it. This foreigner's arrival in Kyoto was on the third day of the ninth month.

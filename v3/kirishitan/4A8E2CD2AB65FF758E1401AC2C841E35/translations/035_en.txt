On the 14th day of the 9th month of Tenshō 16 (1588), men named Tennōjiya Sōchin from Sakai in Izumi Province and Aburaya Shōyu came to Fushimi Castle to meet with Lord Hideyoshi. In casual conversation, they reported: "Recently, a surgeon named Ichihashi Shōsuke and a traditional medicine doctor named Shimada Seian have come to reside in Sakai. We have heard that these two men perform strange arts."

Lord Hideyoshi commanded that they be summoned to perform their arts before him. They filled a large bowl with water, cut paper into diamond shapes and floated them on the water, whereupon they immediately became fish and swam in the water. Or they would take out a "kwanshin-yori" from within their robes, blow on one end with their mouth until it became the size of a rope, then throw it out onto the tatami where it became a large snake. They would also put five grains in a tray and sprinkle sand on them, which would begin moving like small ants, gradually growing until flowers bloomed and bore fruit. They would grasp a chicken egg in their palm, and when they opened their hand, the shell would crack and a chick would emerge, which before one's eyes would become a rooster and cry out.

When there was a request to "show us Mount Fuji appearing in the garden from behind the screen," they briefly closed the sliding doors, went outside, and when they immediately opened the doors, Mount Fuji appeared in the garden. Those above and below were filled with wonder and exclaimed "Ah!" in amazement. They closed the doors again, and when they opened them after a short while, the eight scenic views of Lake Ōmi appeared. Or they would completely project images of Sakai Bay, Suma, Akashi, and other places. Those in the upper and lower halls wondered "What manner of divine immortals are these?" and regarded the two men with suspicion. Lord Hideyoshi contemplated that their magical arts were beyond compare

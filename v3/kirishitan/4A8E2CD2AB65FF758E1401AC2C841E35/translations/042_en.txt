There was one named Lorenzo. He is called an "Irmão." This translates as "head monk" (shuza). This person was from Yamato Province in Japan, with the original name Ryōsai. He traveled from Satsuma Province to Rome, studied Christianity, and came back to Japan. Their religious doctrine is called "Kirishitan" (Christian).

Here, Lorenzo, acting in place of the Bateren, preached Christianity and converted approximately one hundred people to the faith.

Xavier remained in Japan for a while to spread the doctrine. Gaspar returned to Rome the following year in order to send several more Bateren. Later, Xavier finally converted the provincial lord to the faith, established temples, and preached heretical doctrines. At this time, those who joined the faith were as numerous as hemp seeds and millet.

After three years passed, eleven Bateren came aboard merchant ships to Hirado Island in Hizen Province. Thereafter, in Ōmura, Shimabara, Nagasaki, Amakusa, Hakata in Chikuzen Province, Kokura in Buzen Province, Osaka in Settsu Province, Fushimi in Yamashiro, Saikyō (Kyoto), and various other places, they preached heretical doctrines, slandered Buddhist and Shinto deities, distributed alms, and swayed men and women. Because of this, those who converted to their faith were too numerous to count.

Afterward, they selected talented people among their disciples, or took Buddhist monks who lacked spiritual insight, gave them treasures and stipends, and had them falsely learn about Buddhist terminology, Confucian elementary studies, and Shinto ritual practices.

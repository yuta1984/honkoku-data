is the height of [foolishness], so I have heard. To refute this, I say: If Deus is the lord of heaven and earth and created all lands and things, then why has this Deus abandoned countless countries until now and not appeared in the world? Since heaven and earth opened, the Buddhas of the three worlds have appeared one after another and saved sentient beings for tens of thousands of years. During all this time, Deus never appeared in other countries, but only recently appeared in the Southern Barbarian lands.

What evidence is there for this claim of his appearance in the world? If Deus is the lord of heaven and earth, then allowing his created countries to be taken over by subsidiary Buddhas, and letting them spread the Dharma and save sentient beings since the opening of heaven and earth, represents great negligence. Truly, this Deus is a foolish Buddha. Moreover, they say that Jesus Christ appeared in the world as an ordinary mortal in the lower realm and was hung on a weaving tool (cross).

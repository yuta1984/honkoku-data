Humbly submitted petition in writing

Hyakusokuya (shop name)
Heizo

The aforementioned person has been conducting construction work using timber granted at a plot in Aioi-machi, but the construction has been prolonged for years. Having been ordered multiple times not to continue the construction work, we humbly submitted our acceptance letter. However, this time we have received orders to withdraw, which causes us great concern. We humbly request that you mercifully allow us to proceed with self-funded construction.

Should this be granted, if the principal cannot complete the construction, his relatives, guarantors, and group head will ensure without fail that the house construction is completed by the coming December 10th. We make this request on these terms. If you would graciously grant permission, we would all consider it a most grateful blessing.

Item: In the year of the Earth Rat (Boshinoshi), when rebuilding the sacred portable shrine of Gongen-sama, there was no one to carry the mikoshi, causing confusion. Through the mediation of three men—Chūzaemon, Ichiuemon, and Gonbei—it was decided that six shrine priests and six people from Miyamachi would provide laborers, and the participation money would be collected in this manner for the time being. If the shrine territories should overlap again, it was agreed that only the shrine priests would handle the matter. However, disputes arose from last year, and this time it became a lawsuit. Through the mediation of Deputy Yoshida Kinuemon and the town elders, it was settled that all mikoshi participation money would go to the shrine priests, but in exchange they would pay 600 mon as compensation to Miyamachi. Regarding mikoshi carriers, as previously decided, Miyamachi would provide six people. This mediation was completed and agreed upon. From now on, regardless of any resentment the shrine priests may harbor, six mikoshi carriers will be provided, and the entire Miyamachi will accompany the mikoshi procession. Should the shrine territories overlap, no laborers will be provided, and therefore the 600 mon compensation will not be given either. Having made these agreements, both parties shall not violate them. This document is provided as proof for the future. The above is correct.

Document Regarding Written Agreement

Regarding the matter of fire prevention night watch duties: Our village of Miyasaka has been performing night watch services for your town district. However, since the fire patrol rounds from your town district to our village have been delayed, we petitioned about this matter. Thanks to the assistance of Mr. Kitaya Yoemon, since this concerns fire prevention for both parties, we have reached an accord. Without distinction between rural and urban areas, we will continue duties as before, and your town district will also conduct patrols within Miyasaka village as agreed upon. Should there be any violations from our side, please report to our village officials. Should there be any violations of the agreement from your side, we will report to the officials of your town district. This serves as written proof of our agreement for future reference. Thus as stated herein.

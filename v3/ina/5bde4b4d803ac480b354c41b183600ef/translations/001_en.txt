Document of Pledge Submitted

One matter: Regarding the stone cutters of our village, we have investigated all throughout the village and submitted a written report. There are no others besides these. Although they go out to earn their living as stone cutters, they do not take apprentice stone cutters while traveling. Furthermore, we have instructed them in detail to conduct themselves honestly at their places of business, and they have acknowledged and understood each point. Should there be any matter we have insufficiently investigated that comes to your attention later, that person will immediately report it to you. Moreover, whatever punishment you may impose upon us, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. We submit this jointly signed pledge for future reference.
Respectfully submitted as above.

Regarding the Written Pledge We Submit

There is not a single person engaged in stone-cutting work in our village.
Concerning this matter, we have carefully investigated each and every person, and there is not the slightest discrepancy. Should there be any suspicious matters hereafter that come to your attention at a later date, we request that the informant immediately report it to you. At that stage, after your investigation, whatever punishment may be imposed upon us, we shall harbor not the slightest resentment. We affix our seals jointly for future reference. Thus it is as stated.

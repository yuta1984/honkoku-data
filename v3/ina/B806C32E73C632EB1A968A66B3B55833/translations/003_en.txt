showed none at all, and handled matters with sincerity. Your husband also gradually began to
apply himself to the family business. Since you had no biological children, you took in a young boy
and loved him as if he were your own child. As he grew older,
you had him learn the trade, which became a help to the household finances. You handled your daily
lifestyle and even consultations with care and sincerity, so
it is heard that your household lives in harmony. For this admirable conduct,
you are granted coins as a commendation.
You should deeply understand this benevolent favor and work even harder.

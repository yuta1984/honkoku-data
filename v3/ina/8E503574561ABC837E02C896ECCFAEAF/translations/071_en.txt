　　After completing the above inspection, we returned to Seba-juku and inquired into the claims of both the plaintiff and defendant in the presence of both parties. Since there were extraordinary discrepancies, we discussed the matter and notified them to submit written statements by 5 o'clock tomorrow, the 28th.

Same day, 28th
1. When both parties submitted their claims in writing, their statements contradicted each other as they had the previous night, so it seemed unlikely that a quick resolution could be reached. Therefore, we entrusted the entire investigation to the officials of Shiojiri Bureau and issued an advance notice that we would withdraw tomorrow, the 29th. The two officials from Shiojiri Bureau were to withdraw this evening.

Same day, 29th
1. We departed Seba-juku after 5 o'clock in the morning and had lunch at Ono-juku.

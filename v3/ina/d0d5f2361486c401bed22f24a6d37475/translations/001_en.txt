April 5th
Thus,
now that the sacred enterprise (the Emperor's work) has prospered,
so that all people under heaven may live peacefully in their respective places,
His Majesty holds deep benevolence, and all the old evils and abuses
shall be completely
reformed.
According to this imperial intent, when traveling the five provinces and seven circuits
and other highways,
any misconduct like that of
the Bakufu officials in the past
shall absolutely
not be tolerated. Henceforth, when court nobles,
various lords and minor officials,
retainers and others travel,

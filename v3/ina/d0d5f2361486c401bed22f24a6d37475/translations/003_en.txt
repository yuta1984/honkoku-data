Those who go down to Osaka to inquire after His Majesty's condition,
like the imperial attendants and retainers, are established as follows:
Since the January battles,
the enormous corvée labor has caused
the post stations to suffer hardship, therefore
with the complete understanding of returning quickly, all matters
should be conducted simply during travel, so as not to
cause trouble for the common people.
This should be understood.
　　Medium domains and above
　　　Personal attendants: ten people, retainers:
　　　up to fifteen people
　　Small domains
　　　Personal attendants: six people, retainers:
　　　up to ten people

The above has been
proclaimed.

Regarding the Matter of an Exchange Document

In the fourth month of Tenpō 5, Year of the Horse, when the town area was destroyed by fire,
we were ordered to widen the town streets and improve visibility
as a measure for emergency disaster prevention.
Accordingly, everyone widened the town streets and
constructed houses, but Ariga Jiuemon's two storehouses
should have been cut back in line with the town row. However, since there were many
reserve residential plots, the construction was repeatedly delayed.
Then this April, we were respectfully informed that
regarding storehouses that extend into the public road and were not related to the previous fire,
it would be acceptable to proceed with construction as they are.
We all humbly accepted this instruction. However, regarding Ariga Jiuemon's storehouse
in the Shinmachi section, which extends into the town row by seven ken and two sun,
if we leave this extension as it is, it will obstruct the view of the house row
and may become the foundation for future decline of the town district.
We petitioned the town officials about this matter and were deliberating,
but we do not observe circumstances that would warrant repeated claims of hardship.

Regarding the Exchange Agreement Document

In the fourth month of Tenpō 5 (1834), year of the Horse, when the town area was destroyed by fire,
in order to prevent future disasters, it was ordered that the town width be expanded
and visibility improved. Accordingly, everyone was to expand the town width and
construct houses, but Ariga Jiuemon's two storehouses
should have been cut back in line with the town row. However, since there were many
auxiliary residential lots,
the construction was repeatedly delayed.
Then, in the fourth month of this year, regarding the storehouses that had not been affected
by the previous year's fire and were protruding into the public road, it was announced
that construction could proceed as is,
which we all humbly accepted. However, regarding Ariga Jiuemon's
storehouse in the Shinmachi district, which protrudes into the town row
over a span of seven ken and two sun, leaving it as is
would impair the visibility of the house rows and
could potentially become the foundation for future decline of the town district.
The town officials have submitted a petition seeking understanding,
but there do not appear to be circumstances that would justify
repeatedly claiming such difficulties.

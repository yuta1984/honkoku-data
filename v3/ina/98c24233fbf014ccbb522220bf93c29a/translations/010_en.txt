As my personal circumstances have become difficult and I believe it will be hard to make a living, I wish to go to Mikawa-ya Tahei's establishment in Kanda Shin-hakuginchō 2-chōme in Edo for ten years of indentured service. Therefore, I petition that my religious certification be waived during the term of service. Furthermore, regarding my younger brother Zenkichi, since there is a marriage prospect at Jinzaemon's household in Katakura village, I have discussed privately about sending him there as a dependent. Therefore, I humbly petition.

Regarding the above matter, if you would mercifully grant my petition as requested, it would be a most grateful blessing. The above.

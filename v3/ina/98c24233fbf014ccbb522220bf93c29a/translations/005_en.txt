　　Regarding this matter, it was agreed that he would make the payment on his side. However, when he was unable to pay the운상 (water wheel tax) in the winter of that year, I had no choice but to advance the payment, but as he has still not repaid me, I cannot make the payment to the authorities. If this situation continues, I told him to stop the water wheel business, but again last winter the officials came to me, though since the person in question petitioned from the same village, I believe that his livelihood is not my responsibility.
　　I humbly request that you understand this situation and handle the matter as stated in the previous text, which would be most grateful. Furthermore, regarding any inquiries, I would like to respond orally. That is all.

I have delayed the payment of annual rice tax and water mill fees for my tenant farming in Itamachi village, and the village has submitted a petition regarding this matter. I deeply apologize for troubling you during this busy time with official duties. Last winter, when the village officials contacted me about collecting the said annual tax, I was supposed to come immediately, but I happened to fall ill and delayed my response. Although this concerns the crucial matter of annual taxes, I do not treat it carelessly, but in recent years I have fallen into particularly difficult financial circumstances. Moreover, in the Year of the Horse there was a fire that spread to my property, followed by consecutive crop failures that caused me great hardship. I had previously lent money to Sakuemon of the same village, and since the principal and interest had been overdue for several years, I petitioned in the Year of the Snake. Through your benevolence, I was instructed to settle privately with the village, so the village officials requested mediation from Rokubei of Matoba village and Taemon of Miroku village.

They intervened, established regulations for the current payment and annual installments, and the petition was withdrawn. Regarding this matter, the annual installments were to be collected by the village officials each year and handed over to me, with a regulatory document bearing the joint seals of the officials submitted to the authorities, and an agreement exchanged between both parties. This meant there was no need to press Sakuemon directly for payment. However, since the Year of the Horse, nothing has been paid at all. Although I have negotiated year after year, he only says he understands but never pays anything, causing me great difficulty. Nevertheless, until the year before last, I paid my annual taxes without delay. However, last year I could harvest only about four shō of rice from that field, making it virtually nothing, and I find myself in extreme hardship. Therefore, I earnestly requested that the money be collected according to the agreement and immediately applied to my tax payment, but this was not accepted.

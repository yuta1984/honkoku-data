I earned small amounts of money and
procured the items my master preferred, giving them to him. Since I had
washed and used up all of my master's available clothing,
I myself received no work clothes or charity,
and though I appeared unsightly, I never let my master
wear dirty clothes even for a single day.
From this autumn, his illness became
severe and he reached the point of unconsciousness,
so I took extreme care day and night,
gently massaging him and providing kind nursing care.

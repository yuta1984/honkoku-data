Formal Written Pledge

Regarding the matter of rotating duty assignments, until now this duty has been performed strictly by two people. However, this time we have received approval for the reform to have this duty performed by one person, and we are grateful from the smallest merchants to all others. Furthermore, we will definitely arrange for this duty to be carried out as specified, and there will be no discrepancies. Therefore, we submit this pledge with joint signatures as follows.

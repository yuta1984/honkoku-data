Though I am a younger son, I have unexpectedly become the heir and succeeded to the headship of the house. This is no small fortune for me. In this position, I shall devote myself day and night even more to the administrative affairs of the household retainers and the domain, hoping that the virtue of our house will shine forth. However, there may naturally be matters where I fall short. For matters that do not violate the great law, I shall grant lenient pardons. Nevertheless, should there be any thoughtless individuals who violate the regulations established by previous generations, their wrongdoings must be corrected. This time, without going into details about each article of the house laws, I expect all retainers to further understand and firmly observe the principles established in the first month of Kanpō 2, to make prudence their guiding principle even more, and following the metaphor of a boat floating well on water, to achieve harmony between high and low ranks and to encourage loyal service.

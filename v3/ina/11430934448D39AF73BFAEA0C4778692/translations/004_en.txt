Though I am a younger son (not the eldest), I have unexpectedly become the heir and succeeded to the headship of the house, which is no small fortune for me. In this position, I wish to devote myself day and night even more to the administration of the household and domain, hoping to maintain the prosperity of our house. However, there may naturally be matters that do not reach perfection. For matters that do not violate the great laws, lenient forgiveness shall be granted. Nevertheless, if there are any thoughtless individuals who would violate the regulations established by successive generations, their wrongs must be corrected. This time, I shall not issue new pronouncements regarding the articles of house law, but all members of the household shall further understand and firmly observe the principles established in the first month of Kanpō 2, making prudence their guiding principle even more, and following the analogy of water supporting a boat well, they shall achieve harmony between superiors and subordinates and strive in loyal service.

First day of the eighth month, Bunsei 3 [August 1, 1820] - Black Seal

Respectfully Submitted Petition

The succession of Nakamachi Nunoya Ichiemon has been temporarily interrupted. As my younger brother Manbei has formed a domestic relationship, I have privately discussed sending him as an adopted son to continue the succession. Therefore, I respectfully submit this petition.

Regarding the above matter, I humbly request your merciful consideration as petitioned. Should you graciously grant this request, it would be most grateful and fortunate. The above.

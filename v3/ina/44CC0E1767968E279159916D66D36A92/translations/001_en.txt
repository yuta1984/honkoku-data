Regarding the matter of succession of the Hachijo-no-miya Imperial Princess, we have prepared and submitted a written statement. If there are any phrases or expressions that do not meet with your approval, we shall revise them, so please let us know. Also, concerning the Noh performance to be held at Sento Imperial Palace on the coming 17th day, when we reported as we had heard earlier, His Majesty was pleased. However, there are some considerations at Sento Palace, so it has been decreed that it should be postponed for a while. We believe it is most appropriate that you understand this matter accordingly. The above.

October 13th
Chigusa, Former Chunagon
Yanagiwara, Former Dainagon

To Lord Naito Yamato-no-kami

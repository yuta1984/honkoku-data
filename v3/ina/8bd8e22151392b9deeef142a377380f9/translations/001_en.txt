Respectfully submitting this petition in writing

We have received your gracious directive to develop the area continuing from Benzaiten Bridge toward the town, for which we are most grateful. We humbly request to receive a plot of land in the middle section on the west side of the thoroughfare in that location for the purpose of promoting prosperity. On this land, we wish to construct a house with a frontage of seven and a half ken and a depth of nine ken, establish our second son Shinkichi as a branch family, and have him engage in sake brewing and commerce, so that this location may serve as the foundation for continued prosperity. We also humbly request to receive timber for this purpose, and thus submit this petition.

Regarding the above matter, we humbly request your benevolent consideration. Should you graciously approve our petition as submitted, we would consider it a most fortunate blessing. The above.

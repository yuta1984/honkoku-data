Statement regarding the construction of stone walls to enclose Takeda Shingen's tombstone

Regarding the matter of Ichibei, the head farmer of Iwakubo Village in Yamanashi District, Kai Province, under my magistrate's jurisdiction, along with the village officials, who have petitioned for the construction of stone walls to enclose Takeda Shingen's tombstone within the village grounds. After dispatching an official to inspect the site and conducting a detailed investigation, we found that within the Shiba-ma area of the same village, there stands a tombstone that the Great Monk Hōshō-in recognizes as Shingen's grave.

This tombstone stands five shaku and six sun in height and is mounted on a three-tiered stone base.

The other day, when the Head of the West Citadel Library Guards and Ninagawa Echizen-no-kami submitted their inquiry documents, there were no consultations regarding matters that did not require questioning. Regarding the contents delivered to Nao Matazaburo, we have been continuing the investigation of records left by former personnel, and accordingly, the said person prepared and submitted a report. When you took it back yesterday for your review, upon my examination, I found no particular opinions to offer, so I am returning it directly. Please acknowledge receipt. I have also understood the matter regarding circulating it to colleagues at the Main Citadel and having it communicated to Lord Shimosa, who will handle the coordination.

Regarding the review by the elder councilors of the Main Citadel, I respectfully request that you consult with Lord Shimosa and handle the matter appropriately. This is a hurried response to all matters. The above.

Twenty-second day of the fifth month

Furthermore, this morning I received the fire watch report from the West Citadel front. I shall report the details in due course.

Iwaki
Chūjirō Taira no Sadataka was a descendant of the 19th generation from Iwaki Jirō-dayū Norimichi, son of Mutsu-gon-no-kami Yasutada, who was the grandson of Chinjufu-shōgun Mutsu-no-kami Sadamori Asomi, a descendant of Emperor Kanmu. Initially, Chinjufu-shōgun Fujiwara no Hidehira gave his daughter called Kuama-ko in marriage to Norimichi and granted him Iwaki County, from which the family took the name Iwaki. Thereafter, descendants continued through the generations down to Sakyō-no-daibu Chikataka. Chikataka was actually the elder brother of Terumune, the eldest son of Date Sakyō-no-daibu Harumune, but he married the daughter of Sakyō-no-daibu Shigetaka and inherited the Iwaki house. 《Note: From this point, they actually became members of the Fujiwara clan》 Chikataka died on the 10th day of the 7th month of Bunroku 2. His son Sakyō-no-daibu Tsunetaka inherited the family headship from his father.

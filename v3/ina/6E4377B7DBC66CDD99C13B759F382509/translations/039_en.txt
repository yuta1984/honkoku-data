Although his domain was secured through [Date's] benevolence, there was not without hesitation regarding privately reconciling with a hereditary enemy nation, and ultimately no reconciliation was made.

When the Siege of Osaka began, Toshitane served in the vanguard of the Shogun's forces and rushed to battle.
On September 10th, Kan'ei 2 (1625), he died at age 45. His son Toranosuke was still young (6 years old), so Nagato-no-kami Yoshitane handled family affairs and died on October 15th, Kan'ei 11 (1634) at age 88. Toranosuke (said to have inherited his grandfather's name) was granted court rank on December 29th, Kan'ei 13 (1636), appointed as Daizen-no-suke, and died on May 5th, Keian 4 (1651) at age 32. Nagato-no-kami Katsutane (later Taditane) succeeded the house. He was actually the second son of Tsuchiya Minbu-shōyū Toshinao. Since Yoshitane had one daughter but no male heir, he adopted his cousin Toshinao's son and had him marry the daughter to continue the family line (from this point, the Soma became a Genji family). Katsutane was granted court rank on December 28th, Jōō 1 (1652) and died on November 2nd, Enpō 1 (1673) at age 37. His eldest son, Dewa-no-kami Nobutane, succeeded the house.

From his youth (childhood name Manchiyomaru, said to be 15 years old), Nagahide served Lord Oda, always being entrusted with command of one front, never failing to break through wherever he advanced. In Genki 2 (1571), he was granted Sawayama Castle in Ōmi Province along with extensive lands (50,000 koku). This rewarded his years of military valor. Thus, as Lord Oda's retainer, "Niwa and Shibata" were known to everyone in the world, and during Toyotomi's [reign]...

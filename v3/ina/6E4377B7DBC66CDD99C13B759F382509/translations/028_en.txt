In the summer of Tenshō 18, when Kampaku Hideyoshi defeated the Hōjō of Sagami, Tsunetaka rushed to join the military camp, but died at Hoshitani in Sagami Province on the 23rd day of the 7th month of the same year. He was said to be twenty-four years old. Since Tsunetaka had no male heir, his retainer Kurodo Settsu-no-kami Masuda Uemon-no-jō Nagamori lamented the extinction of his lord's house and requested that Nōsakumaru, the third son of the related clan member Satake Hitachi-no-suke Yoshishige, who was eight years old that year, be adopted as Tsunetaka's heir. Eventually receiving permission, when the Kampaku descended to the northern provinces and arrived at Utsunomiya in Shimotsuke Province, Nagamori brought Nōsakumaru to pay his respects, and the boy was given the name Chūjirō Sadataka. 《Note: From this point they again became part of the Seiwa Genji lineage, but this too was actually the Fujiwara clan》

The second son, Tajima-no-kami Nobutaka, followed his father and retired on the 25th day of the 7th month of Meireki 2 (or according to another account, the 5th day of the 8th month). His son Iyo-no-kami Shigetaka received the inheritance from his father.

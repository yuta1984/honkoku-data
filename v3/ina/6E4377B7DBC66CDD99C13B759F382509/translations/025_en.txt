the eastern armies were halted, and [Tokugawa] turned back from Shimotsuke Province and advanced westward to attack. This went against Yoshinobu's expectations, so following the schemes of his kinsman Higashi Sakon-no-Taiyu Masayoshi, he sent a small force to accompany [Tokugawa]. After the Battle of Sekigahara ended, his father Yoshishige pleaded for surrender, {{marginal note: The messengers at this time were said to be Onuki Okura-no-Hito and Mishu Zen}} which resulted in the postponement of his execution. In the spring of the following sixth year, Lord Dainagon returned to the Kanto region. This was said to be for the subjugation of enemies in the northern provinces, so Yoshinobu was greatly frightened. He immediately left his domain to visit the Ogosho, and at the Kanagawa post station in Musashi, he met with Lord Dainagon and pleaded tearfully for forgiveness. [The lord] said, "Then first go to Fushimi and report this matter to the Ogosho."

Hitachi Province was confiscated {{marginal note: 800,000 koku}} and he was granted land in Akita in Dewa Province and transferred there {{marginal note: over 205,000 koku}}. On this day, an envoy was sent to Hitachi Province to inform his father Yoshishige and the retainers of the religious sect of this decision. At this time, Higashi Masayoshi had already died. A retainer, Gunma Tango-no-Kami, remonstrated with Yoshinobu, saying, "Our domain's military forces number forty to fifty thousand men. We also have provisions for ten years. Why do you choose so helplessly to go down to the northern provinces?"

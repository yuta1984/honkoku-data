Document Regarding Written Discrepancy

Regarding the matter of fire prevention night watch duties: Since previous years, Miyasaka and Hokoji-machi have jointly performed these duties. However, in recent years, Miyasaka's performance of duties has become negligent, so we consulted with the village officials this time. With their acknowledgment, they spoke to Miyasaka, but they replied that due to current financial hardship, it would be difficult to perform the duties. Therefore, through Gorobei-sama and Gizaemon-sama, consultations were made with Jinzaemon and Jusaburo's parties, and it was decided that from April to October, from the first night to the fourth night of each month, and from November to March, from the first night to the third night of each month, Miyasaka would perform duties without rotation from the town, and the remainder would be performed by the town. Under these circumstances, no matter what new duties may arise hereafter, we shall not violate anything beyond the aforementioned consultation. Regarding fire patrol rounds, they shall go from the town to Miyasaka, and when Miyasaka is on duty, they shall patrol the town. If there is even the slightest violation, please consult with the town officials. Should we return to the previous regulations, both parties shall perform duties jointly. For future reference, therefore as stated.

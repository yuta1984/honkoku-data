1. When changing shifts between the previous day's main guard and the current day's main guard, and during the three daily shift changes, reports must be properly handed over.
   However, the main guard comes out at the morning fifth hour (around 8 AM) to change with the previous day's main guard, the relief guard comes out at the ninth hour (around 12 PM) to change with the main guard, and at evening seventh hour (around 4 PM) the main guard comes out to change shifts and serves until the next fifth hour.

1. At the guard post, aside from those with official business, chatting and such is prohibited. Especially during nighttime, particular attention must be paid to avoid any careless behavior while on duty.

1. When the lord departs and there is a retinue assembly, close the wicket gate and remove the crossbars on both sides of the main gate doors to stand ready.
   However, for formal ceremonial departures use the main entrance passage, and for regular departures use the middle entrance passage.

1. Upon return, someone will rush ahead from the journey to give advance notice, so at that time act the same as during the previous departure.

1. The middle-ranking retainers and house retainers within the residence should pass through the gate on regular days using identification passes.
   From time to time, discretionary measures should be understood as a general rule.
   Additionally, if identification passes are not returned even after the seventh hour (around 4 PM), they should be submitted to the reception hall.
   This also involves discretionary measures and consideration.

1. When delivery slips are issued from within the residence and are not returned as they are, they should also be submitted to the reception hall on the last day of each month.
   While this is also the established rule as stated above, discretionary measures should be taken.
   Thus, regardless of the matter, there should be discretionary measures and flexible responses as circumstances require.

1. When wrapped bundles are brought out from within the residence, they should be passed through with official seals.
   Additionally, if there appears to be anything suspicious about the wrapped bundles, pay careful attention and inspect them. If suspicious items exit the gate, it becomes the fault of the guard on duty.
   Even without official seals, if something is genuinely reliable, discretionary measures may apply.

1. Regarding passage after the night closing, inquire with the guard captain and receive the keys to allow passage.
   For personal attendants, pages, and foot soldiers, uniformly until the fifth hour (around 8 AM)

Kōka 3rd year, hinoe-uma year (1846), September 22nd
- When daimyo or hatamoto invite [our lord], even though the instruction is to visit through the back gate with a simplified retinue, if there are those who come with a formal retinue, we should request that they enter through the front gate.

- When our lord departs through the main entrance, the gate should be opened only after he has gotten into his palanquin. Previously, there were inexperienced individuals who opened the gate before he had boarded, but since this allows visibility from outside, henceforth strict instructions were given to follow the aforementioned procedure.

- When our lord visits the Shinjuku residence, since he returns through the back gate, there will be no individual instructions each time. To avoid mistakes, one person from each unit group should come out to open the gate. The key should be provided by the monthly duty ōmetsuke. Tea hakama should be worn.
At such times, both departure and return are conducted through the back gate.
Not limited to the lower residence, when visiting the Owari lord or any other destinations to the west of the residence, passage is through the back gate. The responsible department gives instructions each time, and the front gate lower guard should be ordered to perform cleaning.

- When guests enter through the back gate, cleaning of that location should be ordered to the front gate lower guard.

- When our lord departs and the retinue returns, palanquins and spears should enter through the side gate. The same applies when going out to greet arrivals.

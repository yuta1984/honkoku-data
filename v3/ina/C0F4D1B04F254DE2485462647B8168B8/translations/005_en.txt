In the past, foundations were placed under the pillars and filled with massive stones, but when floods struck, the pillars and beams would break away.
Therefore, a new ingenious method was devised to deepen the pillar foundations so they would not be easily excavated even when water accumulated. To achieve this, separate ditches were dug several ri (hundreds of meters) away to drain the water, and finally the construction could proceed as intended. Ah, compared to previous construction, the pillar foundations go deep, probably about one jō (approximately 3 meters). On the southern bank, massive rocks were carved to secure the beam foundations, making them firm and solid. Moreover, this time the villages pooled their efforts and invested funds to support the project, and during this stable period without flood damage, it can truly be said that we obtained the harmony of heaven's timing, earth's advantages, and human cooperation. I hope that those who undertake this work in the future will understand this intention. Therefore, I write this as a record.

Respectfully submitting a petition through this written statement

In the fourth month of the previous year of the Rabbit, through Matsuokaya Matauemon at the request of Katsuzō from Katsuma village, an application was made to me regarding a matter concerning a blacksmith named Tatsugoro, born in Osaka, who had currently become an adopted son at Masaya Ishichi's place in Matsumoto. He had come to request that I help him establish his trade in our locality. In response, I told him that with current commodity prices being very high, it would be difficult to manage such a costly undertaking, and I declined.

However, Katsuzō explained that regardless of how much money would be required for the craftsman's tools and household setup, he would provide the initial capital himself.

He earnestly requested that I handle matters such as petitions to the authorities, town guarantorship, and personal guarantees. Having no choice, I took him under my care, and after the petition was approved, I also paid the water inspection fees and other required payments. However, in the sixth month of the following year of the Dragon, when Tatsugoro was about to leave directly, Katsuzō came and claimed there were outstanding debts, attempting to collect and take away the blacksmith tools. When a woman named Ishi from the household came to inform me, I went directly to Shimizu-chō to stop this, had the tools placed in the custody of town representative Tōzō, and engaged in repeated negotiations. However, he insisted on his selfish demands and the matter could not be resolved at all. Then Tatsugoro returned and sought help from Denbei, a fellow craftsman in Shimizu-chō.

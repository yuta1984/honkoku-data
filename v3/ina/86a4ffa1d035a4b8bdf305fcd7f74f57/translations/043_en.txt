Regarding toolmaker Matasaburō from my group, who has been of poor conduct and once ran away from home, for which you ordered a search while he was missing, he has now fled together with his entire family without exception.
From now on, we cannot predict what kind of troubles he might cause at his destination.
Therefore, we humbly request that he be removed from the religious registration records.

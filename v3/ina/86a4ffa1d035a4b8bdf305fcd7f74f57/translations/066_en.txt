Regarding the dormant sake brewing license he possesses, I heard that this person had somehow submitted a petition for reinstatement of the license.
When I inquired with him twice about this matter, he said he had heard that I possessed a dormant license, so he submitted his petition, but claimed that you (referring to the petitioner) had no connection to it whatsoever.
Therefore, although I am deeply apologetic to the authorities, I have no choice but to make this earnest petition. Kichiemon, despite being aware of the procedures regarding the license I had lent him in previous years, went behind my back to submit his petition - this forgetting of his previous good faith is utterly outrageous. I humbly request that you mercifully investigate the details of this matter thoroughly.
Through your mercy, please make Kichiemon understand the circumstances described above, and allow me to petition for reinstatement of the license, granting me the official permit.

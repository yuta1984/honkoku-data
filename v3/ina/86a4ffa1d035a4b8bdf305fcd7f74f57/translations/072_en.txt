Respectfully submitted,

I had previously petitioned to purchase a sake brewing license (sake-kabu) owned by Toubei of Hirata Village under the jurisdiction of Matsumoto Domain. However, complications arose on his side, making the transfer impossible. Therefore, I have arranged to purchase a sake brewing license owned by Shohei of Fukuyoshi Village under the jurisdiction of Ina Prefecture. I would like to withdraw my previous petition regarding Toubei's license and substitute it with a petition for Shohei's license.

Regarding the above matter, I humbly request your merciful consideration and approval of this petition.

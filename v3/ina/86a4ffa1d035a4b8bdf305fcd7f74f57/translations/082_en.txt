Humbly submitting this oral petition

I, in the ninth month of the first year of Genji (1864), Year of the Rat, mortgaged my possessed rice fields in order to engage in sake brewing under lease in the name of Tomiya Daiji. While I was conducting this business, I have humbly received notice regarding the current policy directive. However, as shop rents and other expenses have become substantial, if I were to withdraw to my home village as things stand, my household would be unable to sustain itself, causing great hardship and distress. Therefore, as a special act of relief, I humbly petition for an extension until the ninth month of the coming Year of the Dog, as per the original term agreement.

Should this be granted, needless to say I shall strictly observe His Lordship's prohibitions, as well as all municipal duties and obligations. I humbly beseech you to hear my previous petition and, with your compassion, allow me to remain in my current situation for the duration of the contract term.

Humbly submitted through this oral statement:
I have been appointed to town office duties for generations, which I consider a most fortunate arrangement, and 
have been serving while receiving your great benevolence. However, while residing as a townsman,
I have no prominent business, and therefore, continuing from my
predecessor until the Tenmei era, I have been engaged in sake brewing business.
Currently, with the rise in prices of all goods, daily operations have become difficult, and
I am experiencing considerable hardship in various aspects. Therefore, I would like to conduct the aforementioned
sake brewing business at the Shinmachi regulation district. I most humbly request your special
mercy, and if you would grant my petition as requested,
I would consider it your gracious compassion and a most fortunate arrangement. The above stated,

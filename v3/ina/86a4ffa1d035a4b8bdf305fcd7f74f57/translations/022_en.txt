Respectfully,
I am an incompetent person, but unexpectedly I was appointed to the honorable position of town representative, which I gratefully accepted and have been serving in. However, due to illness, I find it difficult to carry out the duties of this position. Therefore, I humbly request that you grant me dismissal from this official position.

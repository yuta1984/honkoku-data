Respectfully,
I am an incompetent person, but I was unexpectedly appointed to the position of group head,
which I gratefully accepted and have been serving in. However, as my term of service has reached its limit, I wish to retire
from this position. I humbly request that you grant me permission to be relieved of my duties.

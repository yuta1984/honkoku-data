At the government office, [the document] arrived to Mr. Nakayama Teiji on the 25th day of the 8th month. However, as Heiji had leg pain, last night group leader Kyuji came as a substitute for Kanzaemon and returned to his lodging, so [the matter] was postponed until today.
Heiji has not yet returned to his home province. As the official correspondence has extended beyond a month, it will be submitted on the 29th day. There was no separate delivery of the license for Heiji's location. If this letter is brought, a license will be issued from the Takato Domain office. We were told to understand it in this manner. The above petition is also a copy of what was submitted at Ina Prefecture. Please review it. When we submitted inquiries and various items, there were questions.
It was pointed out that Kanzaemon, being of town representative status, had misunderstood his role compared to the various village heads of Takato. Regarding this matter, when we reported about town representative Kanzaemon to Ina Prefecture, they understood and said it was acceptable since he was a village head with jurisdiction over one town.

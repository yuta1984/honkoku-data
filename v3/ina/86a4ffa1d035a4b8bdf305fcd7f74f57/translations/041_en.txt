Regarding a petition humbly submitted through this oral statement:

As I am in the sake brewing business, I have continuously received great benevolence, and in the previous year of the Dragon (Tatsu), you graciously handed down a judicial decision, for which I am most grateful. Under these circumstances, I wished to settle accounts through negotiation and repeatedly approached Jirozaemon's side for consultation. However, they assert matters according to their own convenience, making negotiation impossible. After the judicial decision was completed, I understood that everything would be divided in half, but regarding the house rent matter, there was an official directive to Sangoro that Jirozaemon's side should inherit it.

With such a directive, not only would I lose the full house rent that I should rightfully receive, but if they interfere in other matters as well, it becomes difficult for me to support my wife and children. Furthermore, while Jirozaemon stubbornly insists on his own way and negotiations have not yet been reached, he has petitioned to have his second son inherit Daiji's estate and continue the sake brewing business, which I believe is entirely a scheme to destroy the main family. With such matters, the main family truly cannot sustain itself. Please examine the separate document with articles as indicated, and after your wise consideration, I humbly petition that my family name may be able to continue.

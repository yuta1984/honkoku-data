Document of Submission

Regarding the matter of gambling, an investigation has been ordered throughout the town, and we have understood every detail of the written directive. Accordingly, we have conducted a thorough investigation within our five-person group, and there is not a single suspicious person. From now on, our five-person group will coordinate together, remain vigilant without negligence, and strictly monitor each other. If there should be any misconduct that we are unaware of, or if anything we have concealed comes to the attention of the authorities from outside sources, then not only the perpetrator and their lodging, but all members of our group shall accept whatever punishment may be imposed. At that time, we will cause no trouble whatsoever to you honorable officials. In this regard, since you have all submitted sworn statements to the higher authorities, we also submit this written pledge for future reference.

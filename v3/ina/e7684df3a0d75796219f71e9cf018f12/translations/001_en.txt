Regarding the matter of our borrowing your sake brewery to conduct sake production, the various terms and conditions are as follows:

1. One sake barrel (specifically for 900 sho), complete sake brewing equipment, one cart house, as well as all household tools and equipment, as detailed in the attached separate document.

1. Regarding house rent: from this July to next July, 18 ryo in gold annually, to be paid without fail before the Bon festival according to this agreement. Should you need funds at year-end, we can lend up to about half the amount with 10% interest until before Bon. Also, if other fees can be exchanged for goods, we will deduct from the rent and pay accordingly. We make this contract agreement.

1. The post-station horse service duty, roof replacement, and repair of various tools shall be handled by us. For major damage, we hope for your assistance, but construction and other building repairs shall be handled by you.

1. The sake brewing tax of one bu each shall be paid by us to the authorities.

Regarding land rent and waterwheel taxes, these shall be paid by you according to our contract agreement.

1. Even if you need the sake brewery back and request its return, we will not vacate for five years from that year. Given the nature of our business, suddenly stopping would cause trouble for collecting outstanding debts, so we contract thus. When we decide to stop, we will notify you the previous year. Regarding rent and commodity prices, no matter what happens in the future, there shall be no increases or decreases from this agreement.

Having established the above terms, no matter what may occur in the future, there shall be no changes or violations. As proof thereof, this document is executed.

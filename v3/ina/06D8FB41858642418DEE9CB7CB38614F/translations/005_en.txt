One　The Genhachi vessel from Kaketsuka in Tōtōmi Province, with offshore captain Matsusuke and six sailors,
　　on the 24th day of the 12th month last year, loaded at Kaketsuka fifty bags of rice for Lord Naitō Suruga-no-kami,
　　along with shipping documents and merchant cargo including lumber and other goods,
　　departed the same day with westerly winds, entered Shimoda Port in Izu Province on the 26th,
　　remained in port, departed from the same location on the 11th of the 1st month, entered
　　Koami-dai Port in the same province on the 12th, departed from the same location with westerly winds on the 14th, when
　　the wind changed to southeast and gradually intensified. Around the evening hour of the Boar (8 PM), in the waters off Jōgashima Island
　　in Miura District, Sagami Province under this jurisdiction, the fierce wind and high
　　waves crashed into the vessel, and moreover, due to rough cargo handling, the high-stacked cargo collapsed, the vessel took on water,
　　and everyone was alarmed and sought means of saving their lives. At that moment, a similar
　　vessel was spotted from behind, so signals were raised,

　　and when it approached and lowered its sails, with the crew's assistance, they abandoned the original vessel, boarded a lighter boat,
　　rowed with two oars to reach it, and all transferred aboard. It was the Kankichi vessel from the same province and location in Mino,
　　which had loaded official rice, with offshore captain Tatsu-
　　hei and other crew members. They related the previous difficulties and rejoiced
　　at their rescue. From there, they entered
　　Koami-dai Village port that same night. The following morning of the 15th, accompanied by ship inn keeper Ichiemon,
　　they reported to the village office. Upon inquiry into the circumstances thus far, the Uraga
　　travel permit, shipping documents, and other items were deposited, immediately forwarded. One fishing
　　vessel with village officials aboard, many sailors, and one person each
　　from the ship's crew went out to search for the original vessel,
　　but its whereabouts could not be determined. Furthermore, a courier was dispatched to the cargo owner and shipping agent in Edo,
　　and an official from the jurisdiction was requested to investigate this disaster.

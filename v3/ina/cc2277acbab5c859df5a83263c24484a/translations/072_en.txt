Since we have also instructed the ginza (silver guild) to conduct wrapping methods without causing disruption, if there are those who make various excuses about minor wear and receive commissions for exchanges, they shall be strictly punished after investigation.
Regarding this matter, it shall be proclaimed without exception to samurai residences, country towns, and temple/shrine territories - for government lands through magistrates, and for private domains through domain lords and local administrators.
This shall be proclaimed as written above.

Regarding old silver and gold coins, genuine character ni-bu (two-bu) coins, old ni-shu (two-shu) silver, Bunsei-era character gold and silver, grass character ni-bu coins, five-ryō coins, ni-shu silver, and old isshu (one-shu) silver - all of which had their circulation suspended - we proclaimed in the previous Snake year that they should be exchanged by October of this Horse year. However, since there are still many coins that have not been exchanged, regarding the matter of exchange locations, we shall continue the current system until October of the coming Sheep year. Therefore, keep in mind what was previously proclaimed and exchange them within the specified time limit.
As written above, for government lands through magistrates, and for private domains through domain lords and local administrators, this shall be carefully implemented.
This shall be proclaimed as written above.

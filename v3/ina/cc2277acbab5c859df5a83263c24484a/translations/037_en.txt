Regarding weights used for measuring gold and silver, we have heard that money changers' associations are using old weights from before the reforms of the Kanbuun era. Therefore, we have repeatedly issued notices that weights from Kyoto, Osaka, Sakai, and Omi should not be sold elsewhere until they are melted down, should be purchased by Goto Shirōbee's office at scrap prices, and that light old weights should not be bought and sold privately. However, we continue to hear that old weights are still being widely bought, sold, and used in western provinces and the Nagasaki region. From now on, not only private buying and selling is prohibited, but such weights must not be hidden and must be handed over to Shirōbee's office. Moreover, weight inspection officials will be dispatched from Shirōbee's office to confiscate suspicious weights.

This directive must be strictly observed.
Although we have repeatedly issued the above notices since previous years and Goto Shirōbee's officials have been conducting inspections, we have recently heard that suspicious weights are still being used. Therefore, weight inspection officials will now be dispatched from Shirōbee's office to confiscate suspicious weights, so this directive must be strictly observed.
The above should be announced by district magistrates in government lands and by lords and local administrators in private domains.

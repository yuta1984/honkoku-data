One matter: A petition for exemption from the chō-dai service duty was submitted by Shinbē of Naka-machi.

Recently, celebration money distributed from His Lordship to the blind musicians (zatō) and blind female entertainers (goze) throughout the domain was not properly distributed according to the allocation, and it has been heard that there are those who did not receive their share, which is extremely improper.
It is said that there were disputes among guild members during this spring, and some did not submit their allocation shares, which is truly outrageous. Not only what was granted from above, but also the distributions that have been delayed since spring must be distributed immediately and properly according to the guild leader's established regulations. In general, regarding the distribution money sent from throughout the domain to the blind musicians and female entertainers, since it is for the support of these zatō and goze, there should be no delays. Even if there are lawbreakers within the guild, the distribution money should still be paid, and disciplinary matters should be handled through the Kigeien in Kyoto for illness visits, while other matters should be dealt with accordingly. If anyone's conduct is improper and they do not follow the guild leader's instructions, they must be reported to the authorities.
The above matters shall be thoroughly communicated by the distribution head.

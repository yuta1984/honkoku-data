　　　Report to the Authorities
When I went to Edo this spring, regarding the matter of killing my uncle Matsumoto Jūrōemon in a vendetta, after investigation, I was told that I may reside anywhere without any restrictions, and that I should be grateful for this. This was conveyed to me in the presence of Inspector Ogasawara Heibei and Town Magistrate Suwa Minonokami. Therefore, I am returning home. Above.
　　　7th month, 8th day, Year of the Horse　Hongō Daizō (seal)
　　　To the Magistrate's Office
1. Regarding Hongō Daizō returning home on the night of the 7th day of the 7th month, when this was reported to both magistrates the following day, after investigation, it was determined that his failure to request permission before going to Edo was improper conduct, and he was ordered into house confinement, which was duly communicated to him.

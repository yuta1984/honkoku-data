Memorandum
1. Regarding the princess who was born this time, she shall be called Princess Yoshi. Therefore, if there are any women in the town with the name "Yoshi," they must change their names immediately. That is all.
This was ordered on the 28th day of the 9th month and announced to the town.

This time, regulatory documents have been issued from the main temples of various sects to their affiliated temples. Accordingly, from now on, not only during Buddhist memorial services but also in daily entertaining and hospitality, matters should be handled with simplicity. People should not think that secular households are treating these matters carelessly. In general, regarding the beginning of memorial services and other matters related to temples, it would be proper to consult with the regulations of the main temple first. This is conveyed as guidance to keep in mind.
Kyōhō 7, 9th month

The above written notice was issued by Watanabe Gonbee-sama during his monthly duty on the 11th day of the 10th month, so it was strictly announced to the town.

We respectfully inquire by circular notice:
1. Since earthquakes have still not subsided, fire prevention is considered the highest priority, so everyone should be even more careful. The senior councilors have ordered that this matter be communicated even to those under your jurisdiction.
1. Due to this great disaster, the lanterns that the senior councilors annually offer to the Buddhist altar at Jōdo Temple have been canceled this year.

Large gold coins (ōban) shall be used as before, and small gold coins (koban) shall be exchanged at the previous rates.
　Hōei 7, Year of the Metal Tiger, Fourth Month

　　Memorandum
Regarding the matter of goze (blind female entertainers) and zatō (blind male entertainers) within the domain: although we ordered that they be restricted to the domain, the zatō report that even when making rounds of the villages, alms are scarce and they suffer from hunger. Even if the domain were to cooperatively provide assistance, if outsiders from other domains were prevented from entering, it would benefit the countryside. We allocated support money for one person's sustenance per zatō and goze, apportioned according to rice stipend, but the villages reportedly could not reach agreement. Ultimately, if zatō and goze from other domains enter and mix with local zatō, disrupting the distribution of alms from religious solicitation, this will cause troublesome problems in towns and countryside in the future. Therefore, we order that zatō associations be strictly limited to the domain.

Since blind people are those who make their living through human compassion, they should be cared for appropriately, but it is difficult to set specific amounts. They should diligently make rounds for allocations at celebrations and Buddhist services among the samurai households and in towns and countryside, and during this time also conduct mutual religious solicitation. Any shortfall in stipends should be made up by caring for zatō and goze on a village-by-village basis within the domain.
　Additionally, zatō in town areas shall conduct religious solicitation throughout the domain, and any shortfall shall be made up by the townspeople.

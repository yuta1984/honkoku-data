A formal pledge submitted

Regarding the stone cutters of our village, after conducting a thorough investigation, we confirm that there are no discrepancies from what was reported this year. Stone cutters who go out to work in distant places shall not form master-disciple relationships at their destinations. Should even one person be concealed and this come to your attention later, please report it immediately. Based on this, we submit this contract guaranteeing the stone cutters.

9th Day
- On the upcoming 11th day, the magistrate (bugyō) will come down before the hour of five in the morning. Before that time, everyone should gather at the square (masugata), and if there are any who cannot attend due to illness, they should submit a written report by evening. I had Kisuke make this announcement.

10th Day
- His lordship will stay overnight in Hirade village, and from there will return to the castle via the Mikka-machi route. When I inquired again about this matter, it was confirmed to be as stated.

Same Day
- I reported that there were no absences due to illness among those going out to meet him partway along the route.

- Regarding the request to stop the passage of horses carrying firewood and other goods from nearby areas along the route his lordship will travel, I was told to ensure there would be no obstacles. However, it was noted that regular traveling horses would be treated separately.

- I had Kisuke inform Yokomachi, Shimosato-machi, Seri-machi, and Hokoji-machi that horses from nearby areas carrying firewood and other goods should not pass along the lord's route. However, I conveyed that regular traveling horses would be treated as exceptions.

- Night watch duties should be performed with utmost care, with proper timekeeping and patrol rounds. During normal times, daytime standing guard should focus on fire prevention. I had Kisuke convey this to the representatives of the ten districts. Even when not actively on night watch duty, patrols should still be conducted.

- The magistrate will come down at six-thirty.

If you would kindly establish rules to prevent violations, it would be a most grateful circumstance.

In the year before last, we received generous understanding at the government office, village reconciliation was arranged, and duties from regular service to ordinary guard duties were assigned. However, due to the circumstances mentioned above, we cannot accept the situation in any way and find it lamentable. We humbly request that after years of investigation, you firmly establish the authority of your administrative role so that our village may achieve peace. The above concludes our petition.

"Please leave it as it is for now and lend it to us," they earnestly requested, so I lent it to them.
When the construction was completed, they built an embankment on the road above
and planted vegetation, which gradually went against
our agreement. When I confronted them about this, contrary to the previous
request, the situation had unexpectedly changed and they said "It's none of your business
to plant vegetation on our land" and spoke ill of us,
so Hikozaemon and Ishichi got into a physical
fight. The villagers
separated them and they withdrew from the scene, but both parties remained on bad terms.
Then, thirteen years ago on August 17th,
Yaichi, Taheiji, and Yaheiji - these three men - intervened as mediators.
Regarding the aforementioned land, they said "We will return it whenever Ishichi's side
needs it," so please lend it to them,
and "Even tomorrow on the 27th, if you need it, we will
arrange to return it." The three men earnestly
made this request, so I lent it to those three men.
Now, as I have need for that land,
I have repeatedly urged the three men to return it.

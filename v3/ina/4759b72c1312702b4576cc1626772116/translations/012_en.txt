regarding matters of local official business, if we
cannot understand their meaning, it may also
become an impediment to future
official duties, which I find most lamentable.

Item: Regarding the land dispute, this matter of thirteen years' standing,
and also the dispute of the year before last, and again this
present matter - while on the surface it appears to be Hikouemon's doing,
in reality Taheiji is supporting
him, and these two men daily
rush about to various places making arrangements.

Item: Hikouemon is by nature a stubborn person, and his sons
are numerous, but they are all of the same character.
With my [illegible] daily increasing abusive language
and harsh words, and their usual misconduct,
this cannot be fully expressed in writing. To encourage a resolution,
please summon Hikouemon and his sons, and
prohibit their abusive language and improper conduct

The honorable authorities conducted an inspection, which I consider a most
fortunate arrangement. On the 10th of this month, I was
summoned to Taheiji's residence, where Yajiuemon, Taheiji, and Yataro, the three of them,
delivered the following decision: regarding the matter of the tree, since both parties were experiencing difficulties
with their petitions, the dead wood should be cut down and the large branches
should be removed as instructed. Concerning the branches and leaves
to be cut, they would be given to the officials of both sides, so we should
understand this accordingly, I was told. Although the matter of cutting down branches
is troublesome,
since it is an inspection by the honorable authorities and
an official decision from above,
I humbly accepted it and
returned home. Immediately afterward, Yajiuemon along with
Taheiji and Yataro, the three of them, were
invited to Hikouemon's residence, where they celebrated with food and drink,
declaring that the legal case was a victory.

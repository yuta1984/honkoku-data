They said there was no proper channel to petition the town magistrate,
so we petitioned only the local headman.
However, we received no prompt ruling,
so I persistently requested that they petition the town magistrate,
but Taheiji refused, saying there was no precedent
for petitioning the town magistrate regarding land matters,
and would not submit the petition.
When we again petitioned the local headman,
he said "Please wait four or five days, we will deliberate
and then issue a ruling," but to this day
we have received no notification. As a result, Ishichi and
Hikozaemon remain estranged and in discord.
The chestnut trees have withered and been removed,
but I humbly request that through your great mercy
and upon investigation, you rule on this land matter
as stated above, order Hikozaemon to remove
the miscellaneous items he has stored on this land elsewhere,
and decree that Ishichi's side may freely use it
as in previous years.
This would be an extremely blessed and grateful outcome.

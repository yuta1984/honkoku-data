"It is not proper to speak in such a biased manner," he said, and then he lifted his buttocks and spoke abusively. On such a large tree, leaving one main branch and two thin eaves branches about two ken up, they cut down everything else. Even the branches that extended left and right, which would not be in the way, and even small thickets, were cut away. The gist of the official directive was that the large branches should be cut, as was conveyed to me, but the fact that they cut away not only the large branches but also all the small branches without exception is extremely improper. Particularly since the matter of branches and leaves had been entrusted to the officials, I thought it would be presumptuous for both plaintiff and defendant to be present together, so even Ishichi's household members refrained from appearing at the scene. Yet Hikouemon and his son came out just like the surface officials and gave instructions, having everything cut as they pleased. This is entirely favoritism in handling, and moreover, it shows no fear of official directives and no understanding of official duties—a most improper handling. Furthermore, I believe it was improper that craftsmen and surface officials gathered at Hikouemon's house for food and drink.

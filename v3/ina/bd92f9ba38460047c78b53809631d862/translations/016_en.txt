When Lord Asai was resting, he spoke as follows:
"Until now, everyone has been concerned, but everything has passed without incident
and we can be relieved. However, after such strict security measures,
there is instead concern about fires and thieves, so
please continue to be vigilant. This is not
a strict order, but each person should keep this in mind." Following this, we immediately
consulted and decided that for about ten days, during the night
we would make rounds once each time in pairs.
When town officials are absent, the rounds and town representatives follow the usual
large patrol schedule. Our duty roster is as follows:

Same 21st night　　　　Fujizaemon
　　　　　　　　　　　Sozaemon
Same 22nd night　　　　Jiemon
　　　　　　　　　　　Matazaemon
Same 23rd night　Suspended due to heavy rain

Same 25th night　　　　Fujizaemon
　　　　　　　　　　　Sozaemon
Same 26th night　　　　Jiemon
　　　　　　　　　　　Matazaemon
Same 27th night　　　　Toyoshichi

We consulted among colleagues that
our patrol duties would end tonight.

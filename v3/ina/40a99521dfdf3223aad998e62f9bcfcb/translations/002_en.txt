A Written Pledge Respectfully Submitted

Item: Regarding the stonecutters of our village, we have thoroughly investigated and recorded all members of the village, and there is not a single other person beyond those listed. Furthermore, those who go out to work as stonecutters do not take apprentice stonecutters under their employ while traveling. We have specifically instructed them to carefully observe the actual conditions at their places of business, and they have acknowledged and understood this completely. Should there be any matter that was inadequately investigated and should come to your attention later, please immediately report it from your end. Whatever punishment you may impose upon us, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. This joint pledge is for future reference, therefore as stated herein.

I have always wished to repay even a fraction of your great benevolence, but since last month, my chronic illness of intestinal obstruction and chest pain have severely worsened, causing me great difficulty. Although I have tried various treatments, they have not been effective, and since this is a condition that tends to recur, there is no prospect of quick recovery. I am deeply troubled and worried that I cannot continue to perform my duties for long while holding these important official positions with many responsibilities.

Therefore, although it is also presumptuous of me to make this request when I have not yet reached the time for retirement, I humbly beseech your mercy to grant me exemption from both official positions. I request that you kindly convey this matter to the council of elders.

Respectfully,

13th day of the 5th month, 1st year of Genji, Year of the Wood Rat [1864]

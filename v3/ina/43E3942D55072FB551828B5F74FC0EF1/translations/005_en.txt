Humbly submitted as a written petition

Item: Regarding the charcoal makers who, in the previous Year of the Rabbit, were granted permission to pay an annual tribute of thirty ryō in gold and have been producing charcoal, when they came to request provisions (food allowance) during this spring, those who appeared had no proper understanding and petitioned that they could continue to pay thirty ryō annually. However, the mountains have become extremely depleted, and the charcoal makers are unanimously reporting severe hardship and distress. We humbly beseech your compassion to reduce the tribute to ten ryō per year as it was previously, granting us this relief. Furthermore, this year follows last year's extremely rare crop failure in the Year of the Snake, making it a particularly difficult year of hardship.

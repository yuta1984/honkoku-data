Respectfully submitting this written petition

Item: I am a person without landholdings (mukō), and until now I have been making a living doing day labor in the village. However, making ends meet has become extremely difficult and I am in great hardship. Therefore, starting this year, I would like to become an apprentice to Kōshichi of Yamumuro Village, who is a stonecutter, and engage in migrant work. I humbly submit this petition. If you would mercifully grant my request as petitioned, I would consider it a most grateful blessing. The above.

Petitioner: Magoichi [seal]

Regarding what the aforementioned Magoichi has petitioned, there is no discrepancy whatsoever, so if you would mercifully grant the petition as requested, we too would consider it a most grateful blessing. The above.

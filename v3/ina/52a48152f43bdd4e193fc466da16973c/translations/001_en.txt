Document of Submission

Item: We have submitted a written list of the names of stone cutters working during this year's work period, and there is no one else besides those listed. Furthermore, we have carefully investigated each person throughout the village, and there are no discrepancies whatsoever. Should there be any matter of insufficient investigation beyond this point that comes to your attention later, we will immediately report it from our end. At that stage, after your investigation, whatever punishment you may impose upon us, we will not raise any objection. As proof for future reference, the village officials affix their seals jointly, and hereby submit this document as stated.

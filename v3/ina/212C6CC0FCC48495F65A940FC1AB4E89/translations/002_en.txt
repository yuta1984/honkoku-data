　Three kan-mon of coins
The aforementioned person's father Banemon had been ill for many years, but during his lifetime she provided care without negligence, and her nursing was thorough. Word has reached us that she devoted herself to filial care, which is an exceptionally admirable deed. Therefore, as recognition and praise, coins are bestowed upon her.
The above matter shall be conveyed. That is all.

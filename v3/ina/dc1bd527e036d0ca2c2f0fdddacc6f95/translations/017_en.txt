The succession line of my relative Kakichi within the district has been discontinued for some time,
but at this time, since there are proper connections with Yoshichi, the elder brother of Shuya from
Shimotomida village, Shimo-Ina county, under the jurisdiction of Lord Chiku Seinosuke, along with his wife and son,
I wish to adopt them to continue Kakichi's succession line, and have discussed this matter. Therefore, I petition for approval.

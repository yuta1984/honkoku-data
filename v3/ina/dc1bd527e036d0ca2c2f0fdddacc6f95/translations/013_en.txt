　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Shimo-machi, Blacksmith
Tenpo 14, year of the water rabbit, 12th month　　　Petitioner: Heizo
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　District representative: Tomouemon
　　To the Magistrate's Office
Approval was granted for the above matter on the same day.

　　　We humbly submit this oral petition regarding the following matter
I was ordered to procure funds in the fourth month of this year, for which I am grateful, and have been gradually
making small payments, but regarding the remaining amount, I have various difficulties and am deeply troubled.
Originally, I served in official duties from the year of the snake to the year of the sheep, and did not engage in dyeing
business, but somehow I wanted to serve even in a small capacity for official business

and went out for work, but during my absence everything was destroyed by fire, and afterwards
I could not borrow money for business capital and fell into dire straits,
sold off my remaining household goods, and had already decided
to go elsewhere to earn a living. At that time, while also serving the Product Office,
with special compassion, I was graciously ordered to undertake lime burning,
for which I was grateful, but year after year lime sales have not gone well, and particularly this summer Iida
imposed restrictions, and it seems the neighboring domains followed suit, resulting in much
remaining unsold goods at the shipping destinations, causing me great distress. Also, through old friendships who helped me,
I handled some summer silk thread business, but even now there are no sales. With various
difficulties, I humbly request
compassionate consideration until future arrangements can be made.
Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously grant my petition with your benevolence,
I would consider it most fortunate. The above.

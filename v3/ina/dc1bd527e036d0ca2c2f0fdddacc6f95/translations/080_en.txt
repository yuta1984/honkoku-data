　Humbly submitting this oral petition
I have been going to Arai Village in Kawashimo-gō with nineteen out of forty-two indigo vats
to perform dyeing work, but this time the place has become unmanned, so
I wish to reduce by eight vats and continue dyeing work with eleven vats as before.
Therefore, I submit this petition.
Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously grant
my petition as requested, it would be a most grateful blessing. The above

The above endorsement was submitted through Lord Takahashi Isozaemon's mediation on the 15th day, but since there was no official response,
he applied again to make the same petition in the 11th month of the Dragon year. When Lord Takahashi inquired about this, he was asked "Have there been such precedents before?"
Ikushichi of Fukuromachi submitted a document regarding a petition for half-duty exemption in Bunsei 8, Year of the Rooster. On the 12th day of the same 11th month, Shōzaemon was summoned,
and the official notice from him was "Half-duty exemption is granted from this year."

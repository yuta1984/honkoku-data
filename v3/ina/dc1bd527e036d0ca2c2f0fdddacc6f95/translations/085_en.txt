The above person was sent in Tenpō 14, Year of the Rabbit, as petitioned, to serve at Shiroki-ya Zensuke's establishment in Banchō-machi of Iida castle town, and has been residing there without religious registration. However, as there have been improper conducts on his part at that place, we wish to disown him after consultation with relatives. Therefore, we petition that he be removed from the registry.
Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously grant my request as petitioned, it would be most grateful and fortunate. The above.

To the Magistrate's Office
When the above petition was submitted on the last day of the month at the office through Gotō-shi's intermediation, regarding what kind of misconduct this Kanetarō committed, though we do not know the details, since it concerns one person, [the authorities said] to make arrangements for him to reform as much as possible, and only if there are particularly serious misconducts even after that, we may petition again, but first conduct a proper investigation. Therefore, we have instructed the Shin-machi town representative to investigate even more thoroughly and return the petition.

I have been honored to be appointed for purchasing goods for official use and have been gratefully serving in this capacity, but due to advancing age and financial difficulties, it has become difficult to manage procurement and such. Therefore, I petition that I may be relieved of my duties as purchasing agent.

presented, which were received and properly delivered together with the young shrine attendant.

With all due respect, I submit this petition in writing:
Though I am an incompetent person, I was unexpectedly appointed to the position of district representative,
which I consider a most grateful appointment.
I have been serving for several years, but have fallen into financial difficulties and
find it hard to continue serving. Therefore, I request that you grant me
a pardon and release from duty.
Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously grant my petition as requested,
I would consider it a most grateful blessing. The above from Fukuro-machi district representative

　　Humbly submitting this oral petition

I am an incompetent person, but unexpectedly I was appointed to the treasury office duties, procurement duties, and product office duties, and furthermore was successively appointed to various supervisory roles, for which I am deeply grateful and have been serving diligently. However, I have become elderly, and moreover in recent years I suffer from chronic illness causing me great difficulty, making it hard for me to continue performing my official duties. Therefore, I humbly request that through your compassion you grant me exemption from my official duties.

If you would graciously grant my petition as stated above through your benevolence, I would be most grateful. End.

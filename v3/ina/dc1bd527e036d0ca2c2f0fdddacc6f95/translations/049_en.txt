　　　Oral statement record
The materials needed for tofu making - firewood, bedding materials, and lye - these three items have gradually increased in price in recent years, costing about 54 mon per block.
We humbly request that you grant us permission to sell at 40 mon per block as we have petitioned.
If this could be approved, we would be most grateful.

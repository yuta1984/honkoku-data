Humbly submitting this oral petition:
Since I have no male heir, I have an unofficial engagement 
with a man called Gonnojō, son of Ihē from Yatsute Village in Tera District, 
which is under the jurisdiction of Lord Chimura Heiemon. 
I would like to adopt him as my son-in-law to continue 
the family line of my birth family, Riemon, and have discussed this matter internally. Therefore, I humbly submit this petition.
Regarding this matter, if you would mercifully grant 
my request as petitioned, 
I would consider it most fortunate. That is all.

Having made various petitions, we were ordered to submit a written statement of our intentions and provided our seal, whereby we believe that the chūma business was granted as requested. From that time forward, we have been operating three packhorses in Ōyama village, six horses in Ina village, and three horses in Suganuma village.

the number of chūma villages is established at six hundred and seventy-eight villages, yet our having conducted the chūma business without licenses until now is improper, and therefore all [villages] are being subjected to strict investigation. If any should violate [the regulations], official punishment will be imposed. Therefore, we submit this pledge document as stated herein.

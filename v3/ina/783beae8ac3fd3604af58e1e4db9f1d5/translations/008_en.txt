Regarding the stonecutters who have departed for seasonal work as listed above, we have conducted detailed examinations by groups throughout the village and hereby submit this report. There are no other persons besides these. Should there be any matter that we have inadequately examined, and should we later incur censure from the government authorities, we are prepared to accept whatever punishment may be imposed upon us. The above.

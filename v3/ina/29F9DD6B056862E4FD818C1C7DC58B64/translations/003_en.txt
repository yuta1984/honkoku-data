Regarding the Receipt of Monetary Funds

One item: 3,000 ryō in gold　　Note: This is documentary money

The above pertains to unavoidable expenses for Lord Naito Yamato-no-kami's household finances. We earnestly requested assistance, and from the 12th month of the previous year of the Rooster, consultations were made with officials of various houses to arrange for accumulated funds. We have now reliably received and hold in custody the monetary sum specified in this document from the patrons, which is truthful. Regarding the repayment method: from this 10th month until the 9th month of the coming year of the Dragon, over a period of 71 months, we shall repay without fail 30 ryō monthly from the principal amount, plus an additional 15 ryō monthly as interest, totaling the amount specified in this document. Since this matter truly involves funds accumulated through requests made to officials of various houses, and given the significant obligations and favorable terms involved, any delays in payment would damage our credibility. Therefore, Yamato-no-kami has given his full understanding, and all officials both in Edo and in the domain have agreed together to repay the accumulated funds without any delays.
This serves as a receipt and custody certificate for the monetary funds for future reference. Therefore, as stated herein.

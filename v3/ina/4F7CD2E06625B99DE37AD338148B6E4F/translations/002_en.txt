has been entrusted to that party, so if this is a matter where the petition can be granted, both senior nobles have privately conveyed that they wish to summon him this time. Also, we have received and reviewed a copy of Bōjō's petition. When Toshikiyo was entrusted to Genhide's care, was this matter reported to the government authorities? Naturally, there must be reasons for succession to Genhide as well. We will listen carefully to the details of this matter and convey our decision in due course.

1. The current Higashi-Bōjō Minister also, after his elder brother's death, was summoned back from Sanshū by his father the Dainagon and allowed to succeed. To whom was Sanshū transferred? Was this a matter of succession? We will listen carefully to the full details of this matter and inform you in due course.

1. Regarding Hiramatsu Chūnagon's petition for hot spring cure, we acknowledge that he should be told he may take the waters at his convenience. A copy of Hiramatsu's petition has arrived and we have reviewed it.

1. You continue to serve without incident, which I find most commendable. Here, everyone is also doing well.

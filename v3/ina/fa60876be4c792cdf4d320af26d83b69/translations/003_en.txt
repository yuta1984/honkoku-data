We respectfully acknowledge these instructions.

Item 1: Regarding these individuals at their travel destinations, they will be as recorded in the lodging house's register. If there are any who do not return home by year's end, the guarantors and five-person groups shall promptly report this. Even for those who return without incident, we shall report to the governing officials.

　　Additionally, for those who own even small amounts of rice fields, they shall entrust their land to others to prevent it from becoming fallow. For land they cultivate themselves, they shall instruct their wives and children not to neglect it before departing.

Although we are a younger son, we have unexpectedly become the heir and succeeded to the headship of the family, which is truly a great fortune. In this position, we wish to devote ourselves day and night even more diligently to the administration of our retainers and domain, hoping to develop the family's virtue. However, there may naturally be matters that fall short of expectations. For matters that do not violate the great laws, lenient pardons should be granted. Nevertheless, if there are those who are thoughtless enough to violate the laws established by generations past, their wrongs must be corrected. So that we need not address matters of family law anew this time, all retainers should further understand and firmly observe the principles established in the first month of Kanpō 2, making prudence their guiding principle even more, and following the analogy that water well supports a boat, they should maintain harmony between high and low ranks and devote themselves to loyal service.

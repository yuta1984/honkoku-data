Regarding the five ryō financing money we submitted last November (Year of the Boar), we have lost the receipt that was issued by the monthly duty officer and have been unable to locate it, causing us great difficulty. However, through your private consideration and arrangements, this matter has been resolved, for which we are most grateful. Should the receipt be found in the future, we will promptly submit it. This written pledge serves as confirmation of this arrangement.

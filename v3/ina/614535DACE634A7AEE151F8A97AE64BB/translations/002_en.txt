Keio 4, Year of the Earth Dragon (1868), February ◯ day (date unknown), issued in Kyoto to supplies officer Kawai Kozaemon
　　　This time Keisho (Tokugawa Yoshinobu) and his rebel followers have fled to Edo Castle, and are increasingly
　　　committing outrageous acts of rebellion, causing the people of all the land to
　　　fall into suffering as if in fire and water,
　　　which His Majesty cannot bear to witness.
　　　Therefore, by imperial decision,
　　　a personal imperial expedition has been decreed. Accordingly, through careful selection of personnel,
　　　a supreme commander shall be appointed. Understanding this, the large and small domains of the Kinai and seven circuits
　　　should each make military preparations. In the near future,
　　　war council decisions will be announced.　Imperial directive

Respectfully taking up the brush to write. Though it is the season of autumn's chill, we are extremely delighted to know that you are all together in good health and spirits. Regarding the matter of the head priest of Kenpuku-ji Temple, when he recently went up to Edo, he fell ill from late last month, and we are most grateful for the exceptional medical care and continuous kindness you have bestowed upon him. Thanks to your benevolence, he has gradually recovered, and all at Kenpuku-ji Temple are relieved. We humbly request that when you have the opportunity, you might graciously convey our gratitude for your kindness to your lord. First, we wished to express our thanks for the above matter, and thus we have written this letter. With fear and respectful words.

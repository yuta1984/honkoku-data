　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Naitō Yamato-no-kami

　　　Kansei 13th year (1801)
　　　　　　March 8th
- Today, as proxy for Itakura Suō-no-kami, I wore fukusa kosode with hemp kamishimo court dress and departed my residence at the hour of the Snake (around 9 AM) to attend the castle
- I sent word through a servant to the ometsuke (shogunate inspectors) that I was attending the castle as proxy for Itakura Suō-no-kami
- Since Itakura Sakon-shōgen was also to attend, I discussed with him the protocol for when official instructions would be given later
- While waiting in the Kari-no-ma (Wild Goose Room) together with others on duty that day, an ometsuke came and showed us a written notification

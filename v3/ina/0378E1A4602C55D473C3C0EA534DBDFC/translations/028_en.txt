When the senior officials came out and took their seats in rows in the Fuyō-no-ma, I placed my fan behind me and went to sit beside the ōmetsuke (chief inspector). After the ōmetsuke's greeting, both I and Sakon Shōgen went out to the Fuyō-no-ma and prostrated ourselves. The goyōban (duty official) announced that due to Suō-no-kami's illness, his request for retirement had been granted as requested, the family headship would be transferred without issue to Sakon Shōgen, and he was being assigned a seat in the Kari-no-ma. Sakon Shōgen expressed his gratitude for this gracious arrangement, and both of us withdrew.

1. Upon leaving, Suō-no-kami's caretaker was waiting at the Naka-no-guchi, so I informed him of what had been announced. Then, as substitute for Suō-no-kami, I brought a written statement for the courtesy rounds to the senior and junior officials for thanks, left it with the attendant at the entrance, and returned home.

1. I did not ascend to the Western Castle as I was serving as a substitute.

The senior officials were seated in positions marked with △ symbols on the veranda of the Fuyō-no-ma. During the rounds, they were seated in this location when the senior officials came out. In the manner of taking seats in rows in the Fuyō-no-ma, we moved to position two and sat down. After the ōmetsuke's greeting, we moved to position three where Sakon Shōgen and I prostrated ourselves together. The announcement was made that due to Suō-no-kami's illness, his request for retirement had been granted as requested, the family headship would be transferred without issue to Sakon Shōgen, and he was being assigned a seat in the Kari-no-ma. Sakon Shōgen expressed his gratitude, and both of us withdrew.

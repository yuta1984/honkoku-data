　　As stated above, the announcement was made by Izumi-no-kami, who was on duty, and after expressing gratitude for this fortunate occasion and offering thanks,
　　I immediately withdrew and waited a little while observing the situation. Then, guided by the public affairs official to the ōkatte,
　　I offered appropriate greetings. The public affairs official was scheduled to inform us
　　when it would be appropriate to depart.
1. Since the off-duty gathering of rōjū had dispersed, I was told
   it would be proper to depart, so I immediately left.
1. Since Chōnosuke's rusuii was waiting at the gate, and the succession
   had been announced and completed, I instructed him that he should return quickly to report this, and that he should visit again later.
   Since our rusuii was also present,
   I made sure to inform him as well.
   　　However, regarding the matter at the gate, it would be more convenient
   　　to offer only brief greetings to their rusuii, while traveling by palanquin
   　　to inform our own rusuii.
1. Regarding the courtesy visits, since one sometimes visits the other party first and then goes out again,
   and procedures vary, I had previously coordinated with the Inaba house, made the courtesy visits immediately,
   then went to Izumi-dono for matters of gratitude, and finally
   made the concluding visit.
1. Then, for the courtesy visits to the rōjū and wakadoshiyori of the western citadel, I submitted a written statement
   as follows at the entrance.
1. Again I went to Izumi-dono, passed through to the ōkatte, called out
   the public affairs official, and handed over a receipt as follows.

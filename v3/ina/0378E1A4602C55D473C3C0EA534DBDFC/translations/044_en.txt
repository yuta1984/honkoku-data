1st day of intercalary 8th month
1. As representative for my kinsman Harima-no-kami's retirement ceremony, I departed home after 6:30,
   wearing bleached hemp formal attire and entered the castle
1. I had informed the inspector through the monks that I would appear as representative
1. Since my kinsman Miki was also present to offer gratitude for receiving the family headship,
   we coordinated regarding the ceremonial seating arrangements
1. Today was also a day for service at the Western Palace, but since I was entering the castle
   as a representative, I informed Iwase Yoshu that I would not attend there
1. The training session concluded as usual, and soon the senior councillors entered the castle, so I went to my seat.
   When the inspector approached, I immediately proceeded to the white study's pine corridor
   and took my seat next to Miki
1. The lord made his appearance and the ceremony participants began in order. Miki offered gratitude for receiving the family headship,
   then I also came forward and prostrated myself, was announced as Naito Harima-no-kami,
   and withdrew from my seat

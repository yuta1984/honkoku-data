Kansei 13th year (1801)
March 6th

1. Wearing fukusa kosode and hemp kamishimo formal attire, I left home after 6:30 and went to see Toda Uneme-no-kami, who was on duty that day. I went through the service entrance and called for the steward. I stated that I would make an inquiry regarding the submission of a petition for retirement and succession due to Itakura Suō-no-kami's illness.

1. Soon the steward came out and said he would guide me to the guest reception room, so I waited in the entrance area. When Uneme-no-kami appeared in the guest reception room, I held the petition in my right hand and, together with Ichioka Tango-no-kami of the advance guard, briefly exchanged greetings at the threshold of the guest reception room. I announced myself as "Naitō Yamato-no-kami" and entered the guest reception room. I sat about one ken (approximately 6 feet) away from Uneme-no-kami, placed the petition to my right, briefly exchanged greetings, raised my head, and stated that "we humbly petition for Itakura Suō-no-kami's retirement and succession due to his illness." I took the petition to Uneme-no-kami's side, removed the outer wrapper, and presented it directly. While he read it, I placed the wrapper to Uneme-no-kami's right side and withdrew about one ken as before, placing my hands on the ground in a respectful posture. After Uneme-no-kami finished reading the petition, Ichioka Tango-no-kami came forward and submitted a detailed report, then withdrew to beside me. When Uneme-no-kami acknowledged us with a bow, both of us exchanged closing greetings and withdrew. Afterwards, I met with Suō-no-kami's caretaker at the gate and informed him that "the petition was received without incident," then returned home.

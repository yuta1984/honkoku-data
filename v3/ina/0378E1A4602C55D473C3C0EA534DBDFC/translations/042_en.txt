After waiting for a moment, took my seat, and had Izumo-no-kami also sit to my right.
　　Then I raised my head and said, "I humbly petition for the retirement and succession of Naito Harima-no-kami due to illness," and took the outer wrapper of the petition to submit it.
　　During the review, the outer wrapper was placed to the right of Ukyo-no-taiyu-dono, and I remained in attendance.
　　When the review was completed, Izumo-no-kami presented the medical report, which was also reviewed.
　　After receiving acknowledgment, both of us offered our thanks and withdrew from our seats.
1. At the gate, I informed Harima-no-kami's caretaker that the submission had been completed without incident.

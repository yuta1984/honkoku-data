Furthermore, tomorrow morning the senior councillors will ascend to the castle at the regular time, which Nōshū also informed us of. Also, today was Manabe Wakasa's duty day, but due to the formal visit he refrained and remained behind, so Notō-no-kami served as assistant. Additionally, it was Abe Suruga's duty day, but Ukon Shōgen served in his place. We also inform you of these matters. The above.

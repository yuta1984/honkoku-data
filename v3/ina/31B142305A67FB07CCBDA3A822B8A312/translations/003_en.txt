1. After the third piece concluded, during the intermission (onaka-iri) when the ceremonial leg stands and large covers (yōkyaku hirobuta) were cleared, I went to the vicinity of the veranda of the Kiku room where Mizuno Sakon-dono was waiting. From there, we went together to the Sakura room of the Black Shoin and took our seats. The deputy inspector informed us that he would provide direct guidance. Subsequently, when the Nikkō Gate Master passed through the Bamboo corridor, I took my fan and prostrated myself, receiving a brief acknowledgment before he proceeded to the Seiko room. Sakon-dono and I followed behind and took our seats on the veranda of the Seiko room. The assistant officials (kayaku-shū) also sat behind me, and shortly after, one of the junior councilors also came out to sit on the veranda. Details as shown in the diagram.

1. After this, the meal was served and all the dishes were arranged, and the senior councilors came out for greetings.
   Note: At that time, Sakon-dono briefly informed the high-ranking families that they would come out for greetings.

1. After the senior councilors' greetings were completed, the junior councilors also came out for greetings. Then the ceremonial bowls and sake vessels were brought out, and the duty officer came out as messenger. On this occasion too, I provided guidance to Sakon-dono. After the duty officer's attendance and messenger duties were completed, the earthenware cups and long-handled sake vessels were brought out and cleared, hot water was served, all the meal trays were removed, and sweets and tea were served, followed by a second serving of sweets. When these were cleared, following the same procedure as when passing through the Seiko room, Sakon-dono and I went to the Sakura room and took our seats. Then, when the Gate Master withdrew and passed by, we prostrated ourselves and received a brief acknowledgment as he withdrew through the Bamboo corridor. After that, Sakon-dono and I withdrew from the veranda of the Seiko room through the Yamabuki room, and while the Noh performance was continuing, we went out to the large hall to watch.

1. After the Noh performance concluded, following the same procedure as before, everyone completed the formal audience in the second room of the large hall, sat together with the high-ranking families in the direction of the third room for the formal presentation, awaited the Nikkō Gate Master's departure, prostrated ourselves as he passed, and immediately withdrew.

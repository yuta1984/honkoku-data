They provided guidance, allowed them to rest briefly, and served tea and sweets. After that, they went out one after another to worship at Myojin Shrine. Of course, guides were provided for each group. After completing the shrine visit, they rested at Jinguji Village and were served lunch. At the hour of nanatsu (around 4 PM), they returned to Takashima's honjin (official inn), and shortly after, were served dinner.

At dusk, at the half-hour of mutsu (around 7:30 PM), they began their surveying work. In the garden within the gates of the honjin, they laid five or six neko mats and spread goza mats over four or five regular mats.

The dedication of weapons to various shrines as stated in the donation document is entirely an expression of gratitude accumulated over the years from when they were first received until the return of domain registers to the emperor. It is our earnest wish that through the divine virtues of the various deities, the parishioners of each district and village may enjoy eternal peace and safety. We shall always safeguard these items collectively and ensure they are not lost or damaged for future generations.

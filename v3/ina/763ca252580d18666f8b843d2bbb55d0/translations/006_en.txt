The receipt for this has been kept. Furthermore, in the year of the Dragon (Tatsu), sake sales were poor, so 5 ryō was paid to Sozaemon of Yokokawa village according to the accounting arrangement. Last year in the sixth month of the year of the Snake (Mi), Kyūzō and Sozaemon came for negotiations, but due to continued economic hardship and no profit from sake brewing, they requested an extension of the payment deadline. However, this was not agreed to, and this year there have been repeated negotiations, but no settlement was reached, leading to this lawsuit. We deeply apologize for this situation.

Certificate Document

Regarding the sacred land within your property that I have received in perpetual transfer according to the deed, it is indeed legitimate. Particularly concerning the Kato Road, as has been customary, you may freely pass through my land from the ditch edge at the bottom of the marsh. I will never raise any objections regarding this right of passage in the future. This certificate documenting our agreement is as stated above.

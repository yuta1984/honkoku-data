However, since both villages are essentially one entity, this is not a matter that Kainuma Village alone can freely decide. But because [Kainuma Village] is closest to the sacred rice fields, Kainuma Village has been taking care of [the arrangements]. Given that this has been the situation from the beginning, there is no reason for Sakurai Village to now hold a similar celebration with their own sweet sake. Therefore, according to established custom, Kainuma Village shall take care of the sweet sake, and regarding all other religious matters, no distinction shall be made between the two villages. Understanding that they were originally one village, they shall harmonize and execute [the festival] without delay.

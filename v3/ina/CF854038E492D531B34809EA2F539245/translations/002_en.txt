Copy of the Judgment Document for the Sweet Sake Festival

Kainuma Village
Sakurai Village

Every year on August 15th, during the festival of the tutelary deity Hachiman, the shrine priest would make sweet sake using rice from the reserved rice fields, with the village group leaders (kumigashira) of Kainuma Village taking care of the arrangements. The festival was held on the shrine grounds and the sweet sake was also served to worshippers. However, since the year before last (the year of the Ox), Sakurai Village began taking the sweet sake out to hold their celebration at Shibahara, which led to a dispute. Both sides submitted petitions, so we summoned them and conducted a thorough investigation. Sakurai Village claimed they had ancient precedent, but they had no proof, and moreover, this sweet sake was made from rice from the sacred rice fields.

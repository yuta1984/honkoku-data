they arranged this matter.

1. Today, Kuze Yamato-no-kami was listed on the posted notice as the White Shoin seating magistrate, but Ōmetsuke Inoue Nōshū conveyed that he could not attend due to illness. It was also conveyed that when a replacement was determined, they would be informed. After a while, Nōshū sent word that he wished to meet with me, so I went to the corridor area in front of the inspector's room, where I was shown a written notice stating that Itakura Iyo-no-kami had been appointed as Kuze Yamato-no-kami's replacement. I conveyed this information to Iyo-no-kami as well, and we agreed to serve together in consultation.

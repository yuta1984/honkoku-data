1. When the third act of the Noh was completed, all those present stood on the wooden veranda, and after attending to necessities and gathering together, we positioned ourselves with the Gama Sennin sliding doors of the north veranda of the great hall behind us. Shimōsa and I took our seats and waited. After the court nobles withdrew to the Tenjō-no-ma, we also called upon Hori Yamato, and the three of us consulted and proceeded to the Sakura-no-ma in the corridor. We positioned ourselves with the sliding doors behind us, facing the alcove, and seated ourselves in order of rank from the second tatami mat from the duck sliding doors.

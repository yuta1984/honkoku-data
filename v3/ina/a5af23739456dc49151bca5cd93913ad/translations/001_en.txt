The Kōshin Hall, Twenty-Third Night Hall, and Kannon Hall within the precincts of Mankōji Temple, as well as both Baikai temples, were destroyed by fire in the first half of this year. Since reconstruction would be difficult with our own resources alone, we have been granted permission to conduct fundraising activities for three years as requested. Therefore, we would like to receive donations regardless of the amount, from those with sincere intentions.

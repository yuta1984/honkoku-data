A Written Pledge

Item: Regarding the night watch duty for Hokoji-machi, our village has been continuing this duty in rotation with all villagers participating since previous years, having inherited it from the town district. This time, after consultation within our village, through Fujiya Gunji we consulted with the town representatives and requested to serve definitively four nights per month, from the first night to the fourth night of each month beginning from the new moon. With your approval, we have agreed and settled on the above arrangement, and there is no discrepancy. Now that both parties have discussed and settled this matter, even if any excessive duties or new obligations arise for our village in the future, we will definitely fulfill them. Regarding this matter, there shall be absolutely no violation or disorder. We submit this pledge as evidence for the future. Therefore, as stated.

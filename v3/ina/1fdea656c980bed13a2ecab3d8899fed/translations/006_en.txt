On the twenty-fifth day of the third month of the year of the Rabbit, I sent twenty ryō in gold to Kyūzō's place, dispatching it with a letter from Jinuemon carried by this messenger. On the twentieth day of the fourth month of the same year, I repaid fifty-five ryō in gold as a partial payment toward the principal, recording it in the main promissory note for verification. Additionally, I sent three ryō in gold as shop rental fees, and securely kept the receipt for this. Furthermore, on the sixth day of the fourth month of the previous year of the Boar, I repaid fifty-five ryō in gold as principal and interest through a separate account. At that time Kyūzō was absent, so I handed it over to Kyūhachi and his wife. At the same time, I separately sent three ryō in gold as interest on thirty ryō. I kept the receipt for this. Moreover, in the year of the Dragon, due to poor sake sales, I paid five ryō in gold to Shōuemon of Yokogawa village according to our accounting arrangement.

Shōuemon. Last year in the sixth month of the year of the Snake, Kyūzō and Shōuemon came for negotiations, but due to continuing economic hardship with no profit from sake brewing, they requested an extension of the repayment period. However, there was no agreement, and although there have been repeated negotiations this year, no settlement has been reached.

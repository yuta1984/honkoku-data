Since Kyūzō of Narakawa-juku in Kiso had long-standing connections with Hachiuemon, I discussed with Kyūzō about arranging financing, wanting to combine sake brewing as a joint business venture. Kyūzō then came to my place and explained that we would each contribute two hundred ryō in gold for the various expenses of sake brewing.

Together we would manage with that money and produce sake jointly according to the agreement, with all matters properly arranged. In the following year of the Rooster, elder brother Hachiuemon and Shōuemon of Yokogawa village went to Nakatsugawa in Mino Province, where Kyūzō went out to meet them, and as previously discussed, the two men received one hundred ryō in gold, and upon returning to the village, brought the receipt to me. After that, Kyūzō brought another one hundred ryō in gold, making a total of two hundred ryō borrowed during the ninth month of the year of the Rooster. At that time, I submitted a sealed document addressed to both Shōuemon and Hachiuemon. Regarding this matter, we met annually in the fourth month to settle accounts and distribute profit shares, completing the annual accounting from the year of the Dog through the year of the Tiger.

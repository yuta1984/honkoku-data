He returned fifty-five ryō in gold, and furthermore requested annual installment settlement. Kyūzō's response was that if fifty-five ryō had been returned from the principal in the year of the Boar, there would have been no agreement to pay twenty ryō each year in interest money for the three years of the Rat, Ox, and Tiger, and it would have become an annual installment settlement.

If that were the case, when pressed about whether there were any documents that could serve as proof of this, he stated that he possessed a receipt for fifty-five ryō written in the hand of his late father Kyūzō. When we requested to examine it and discussed the matter, we were shown a copy of the receipt, but finding it suspicious, we investigated Kyūzō's personal account books and found that there was absolutely no record of receiving anything from the principal amount. The matter of the fifty-five ryō was a separate issue: fifty ryō in principal was lent in the seventh month of the year of the Dog, and for the ten months until the fourth month of the year of the Boar, five ryō in interest was added, plus an additional three ryō (this being an amount to be paid separately), making a total of fifty-eight ryō received on the seventh day of the fourth month of the year of the Boar. Since Kyūzō was absent, a promissory note was received from Kyūhachi.

7th month, 8th day
　　　　　　　　　　　Hongō Ōkura [seal]
　　To the Magistrate's Office

1. Hongō Ōkura returned on the night of the 7th day of the 7th month. When this was reported to both Magistrate's Offices the following day, after investigation, it was determined that when he went to Edo he gave no prior notice, and moreover he was absent when a deputy was dispatched. He was reprimanded for this, and this matter was conveyed to him.

　Official Notice　　　To Hongō Ōkura

Your conduct has long been reported as unsatisfactory. This spring you went to Matsumoto and from there directly proceeded to the capital. At that time you failed to report your departure to the office, and only reported it after a considerable interval had passed, which was improper. Moreover, the way you handled the recent incident in Edo has been reported as increasingly improper. This is extremely negligent behavior. Therefore, although you were previously granted exemption, regarding the sword you have been using until now, you are ordered to report it as was done previously, so you must understand this accordingly.
　　Year of the Horse, 7th month, 10th day

As stated above, with Takeda Shichirō Uemon serving as monthly duty officer and Yamagata Gozaemon in attendance, on the 10th day of the 7th month at the evening hour of six, Hongō Ōkura was brought along and this notice was delivered. Particularly regarding Ōkura's sword, we were ordered to receive it and deliver it to Hongō Gengozaemon's residence, so we immediately delivered it to Gengozaemon's residence.

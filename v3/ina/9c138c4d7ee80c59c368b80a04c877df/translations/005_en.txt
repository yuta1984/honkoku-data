7th month, 8th day
Hongō Ōkura (seal)
To the Magistrate's Office

1. When Hongō Ōkura reported that he had returned on the night of the 7th day of the 7th month, this was reported to both magistrate offices the following day. After investigation, it was found that when he went to Edo he gave no notice of departure and furthermore did not send a representative, so he was reprimanded and this was announced to him.

Pronouncement to Hongō Ōkura

We have long heard that your conduct is poor. This spring you went to Matsumoto and from there went directly to Edo. At that time, you failed to report your departure to Edo to the office, and only reported it much later, which is misconduct. Moreover, we hear that your handling of the recent incident in Edo has been increasingly improper. In any case, this is the height of negligence. Therefore, regarding the sword that had been exempted from confiscation and which you have been using until now, we now order its confiscation as before, so you should understand this accordingly.

Year of the Horse, 7th month, 10th day

As written above, with Takeda Shichirōemon-sama serving as monthly duty officer and Yamagata Gozaemon-sama in attendance, this was announced to Hongō Ōkura at sunset on the 10th day of the 7th month. Particularly regarding Ōkura's sword, we received it and were ordered to hand it over to Hongō Gengozaemon's younger brother, which we immediately did.

The ancestors of the Hongō family were retainers of Takeda Shingen of Kai Province. When Shingen's fourth son, Nishina Gorō Nobumori, became the lord of Takatō Castle, they came together and settled here. After the fall of the Takeda family, they established their residence in Takatō and lived as village samurai (gōshi) for generations. They acquired a residence in Kamimachi (present-day Honmachi) where they lived. The property was magnificent, with a frontage of several dozen ken and extending all the way to Shimizu-machi in depth. There was a riding ground within the estate where they regularly took walks. Local children sang about them, and townspeople commented that they were "like gods and buddhas."

During the Genroku era, they began sake brewing and employed several hundred people. They also had a secondary residence in Sawatari within Haruchika village in the same district, and made many donations to shrines and temples. In Genroku 4 (1691), when Lord Naitō Kiyohira became the castle lord of Takatō and made his first entry, Sukekirō went out to meet him at Karamatsu-sawa with a horse. During Lord Naitō's reign, Sukekirō's younger brother Asaemon served as the town wholesale merchant representative in Takatō.

Their family temple was traditionally the Jōdo sect Shinnen-zan Muryōin Mankō-ji in Takatō (which remains unchanged to this day), and they donated the main Buddhist statue and temple bell to that temple. Sukekirō's father, Hongō Jōen, also donated a hanging bell to Kenpuku-ji temple. Before that, it is said he solicited the establishment of Hachiman Shrine in Yamada village (now called Kōnan village).

Later, during the Kyōhō era, when Chigiri Heemon served as the magistrate, they possessed rice fields, dry fields, and mountain forests in Noguchi village in Tera district, which was part of their landholding. Therefore, they moved to that location, and their descendants have continued unbroken to the present day.

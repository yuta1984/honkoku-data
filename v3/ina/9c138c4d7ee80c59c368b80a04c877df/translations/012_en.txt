The ancestors of the Hongo clan were retainers of Takeda Nobukama of Kai Province. When Nobukama's fourth son became lord of Takato Castle, they came and settled there together. After the fall of the Takeda house, they established their residence in Takato and lived as rural samurai (gōshi) for generations. They acquired a residence in Kamimachi (present-day Honmachi) where they lived. Their estate was magnificent, with a frontage of several dozen ken and a depth extending to Shimizu-machi. There was a riding ground within the estate where they regularly took walks. At that time, local children sang: "One can imitate gods and buddhas, but cannot imitate Hongo Sukeku," and he was thus praised by the people of the world.

From around the Genroku era, they began sake brewing, producing several hundred koku. They also had a secondary residence in Sawatari within Haruchika village of the district, and made many donations to shrines and temples. In Genroku 4 (1691), when Lord Naito Kiyohira became castle lord of Takato, Sukuro went out to welcome him at Karamatsu-sawa with a led horse during his initial entry. Around the time of Lord Naito's appointment, Sukuro's younger brother Asaemon served as the wholesale merchant representative (ton'ya-yaku) of Takato town. Their family temple was traditionally the Jodo sect temple Shinnen-zan Muryoin Manko-ji in Takato town (which remains unchanged to this day), and they donated the principal Buddhist image and temple bell to that temple. Sukuro's father, Hongo Jōen, also donated a hanging bell to Kenpuku-ji temple. Before that, it is said they invited the spirit of Hachiman Shrine to Yamada village (now called Kanan village). Later, during the Kyoho era, because they possessed rice fields, dry fields, and mountain forests in Noguchi village of Tera district under Lord Chimura Heiemon, they moved to that area, where their descendants have continued in an unbroken line to the present day.

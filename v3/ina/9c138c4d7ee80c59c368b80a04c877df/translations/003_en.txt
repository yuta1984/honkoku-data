Kyōhō 8th year, year of the Rabbit (1723)
1. Regarding Hongō Ōkura: On the 6th day of the 8th month of the year of the Rabbit, when his lordship was to inspect the land reclamation work at Omote-Kimura River, Takeda Shichirōemon-sama, serving as the monthly duty officer, summoned Ōkura to the residence on the 5th day and ordered him not to perform cleaning work at Sawatari and furthermore ordered Ōkura not to participate. However, he disobeyed these orders and performed cleaning work, and particularly since Ōkura also participated, on the 9th day of the same month, Ōkura was ordered into house confinement, and specifically his gate was nailed shut. He was pardoned from the 9th day of the 8th month until the 4th day of the 10th month.
Takeda Shichirōemon-sama, as monthly duty officer, ordered that all matters should be managed by us three people.

1. Regarding Hongō Gengōemon as well: Since he followed Ōkura's misconduct, and being his nephew, he was also (punished) from the 9th day of the 8th month until the end of the same month, then pardoned.
For this case as well, regarding petitions, consultations, and town administration, we three were ordered to take charge and manage.
This was ordered by Takeda Shichirōemon-sama as monthly duty officer.

This person's (the widow's) husband Matazaburo was in an official position in Bunsei 7 (1824), 
but was found guilty of misconduct. At this time, if Matazaburo were 
still alive, he would have wanted to present some kind of thanksgiving money and request 
rehabilitation, but being a woman, she cannot fully express 
her true feelings, so she presents this small donation. Although it is a small amount 
and not worthy of recognition, we mention it 
because of the beautiful intention.

This person's residence burned down in the first month of the Boar year, 
and due to some misconduct, he was sentenced to banishment, 
but through mercy, his land and household goods were 
given to his family members. However, his wife died of chronic illness 
last June, and this year the three children were sent to relatives.

Naitō Yamato-no-kami,
Regarding the villages in your domain of Shinshū Province,
where there was a poor harvest in the year of the Snake two years ago,
we have heard that relief measures and assistance
have been properly provided to the villagers.
This is truly commendable,
such is our official judgment.

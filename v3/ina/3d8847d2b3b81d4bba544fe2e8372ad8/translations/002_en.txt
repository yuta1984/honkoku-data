Document of Submission

Item: Regarding the matter of stonemasons in our village, we have thoroughly investigated the entire village and submitted our report. There are no others beyond those listed. Although stonemasons are away working in other places, they do not take on apprentices in those locations. Furthermore, we shall continue to monitor the actual conditions at their places of business. When we explained this matter in detail, they understood and agreed to each point. Should there be any inadequate investigation on our part that comes to your attention later, please notify us immediately from your end. Whatever punishment you may impose upon us, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. This joint-signature document serves as record for the future.

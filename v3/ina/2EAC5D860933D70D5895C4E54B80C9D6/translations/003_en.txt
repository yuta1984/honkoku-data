Though I am an inadequate person, since inheriting the divine lineage of Toshogu, I have always made it my heart's desire to follow divine virtue in governing the realm. However, my days in this world are short, and I have been unable to fulfill this aspiration. Now I do not know what to say about this situation.

Looking at past eras when rulers were young and nations were in peril, in such times people invariably争ed for power, formed factions, and suspected each other without harmonizing their hearts. Even people from distant lands like Hu and Yue, when crossing waters in the same boat, can overcome the perils of wind and waves if they unite their hearts and combine their strength. How much more so for the people of today's world, who were born and raised during the hundred years of peace following our house's founding - who among them does not owe their existence to the divine grace of Toshogu?

If people repay that divine grace and think of the welfare of the world and its people, they should take the events of ancient times when rulers were young and nations imperiled as a profound warning. Should they lack such resolve, it would not merely bring calamity upon our house, but would most certainly bring misfortune upon all the people of the realm. It is my earnest wish that all people throughout the land, regardless of high or low station, great or small, should understand this well.

Inō Kangeyu (Tadataka) will be conducting surveying work for official purposes along the Nakasendō and Kisokaidō routes, from Yodo in Yamashiro Province via the Saikokukaidō to Shimonoseki, and through Buzen, Bungo, Hyūga, Ōsumi, Satsuma, the coastal areas and islands of Higo, as well as Iwami, Owari, Mikawa, and the Kōshūkaidō, traveling both ways. During this journey, surveying work will also be conducted along the route. Therefore, arrangements should be made in advance to ensure there are no obstacles. Particularly in local areas where passage is difficult, boats should be provided from those locations with guides to ensure smooth passage.

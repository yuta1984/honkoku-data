Copy

　Furthermore, whereas this official notice is to be reviewed by each village,
　if time is wasted on making copies and such, it will interfere with travel,
　so while copies are being made at post stations or by village headmen and other
　administrative heads and associations, please notify the villages
　and arrange matters so there will be no interference. That is all.

For the official duty of surveying the provinces, seventeen people of high and low rank will
depart from Ikeda in Settsu Province and stay overnight in Numa in Mino Province on the coming 19th day.
On the following 20th day, they will begin their official duties from that place, pass through
Inuyama in Owari Province to Nagoya, and from there survey through Mikawa Province and Iida in Shinano Province
via the Ina Highway to Fuchu in Kai Province.
Please arrange for the relay of people and horses without delay as per the official documents, and ensure there are no hindrances to lodging and other matters.

　send people to serve as guides, and prepare written documents according to the draft attached separately
　to be brought to the previous lodging place.

I have respectfully read your letter. As you mentioned,
although the autumn heat continues, I humbly congratulate you on
your continued good health and well-being. Now, regarding
your request to borrow the records (tetsuke) from when Lord Kaga
performed his duties as Nishinomaru guard
on the sixth day of the seventh month of Tenpō 8,
I have prepared them on my end recently,
so I am informing you that I can lend them to you in order. Therefore, I am sending
one volume of the aforementioned records, which please receive.

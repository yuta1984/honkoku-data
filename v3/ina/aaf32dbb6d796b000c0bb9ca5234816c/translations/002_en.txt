accompanied by Tetsutarō, we prepared gifts for the officials and returned to the residence.

Item 1: On the same day before noon, we went at the instruction of Ōgiya Kichiuemon and heard about this current matter. Negotiations are to begin on the coming 29th. As of evening, nothing has yet been settled, and there are some inconvenient circumstances. We believe we will eventually need to go to Yokohama as well.

Item 1: The written orders for various items have arrived here and we have examined them. From what we have heard successively, truly all goods are at high prices and are quite difficult to obtain. At Chōbei's place they say that even in Edo people are astonished. For now, we have not ordered any hakama, haori, or obi at all, and are making do with five-bu clothing. Even for Hakata obi that we liked, they ask three ryō for a men's obi. What should we do? We have heard that women's obi of old silk cost ten ryō. We have not purchased a single item. Even during travel, all goods are expensive - just a brief rest costs 200 mon, a meal costs from 500 mon, and if we have drinks together it costs two shu each. This is quite troubling.

Item 1: Here too it is not very hot, and at this time of year, padded haori and sometimes a胴着 (dōgi - body warmer) are just right for wearing. Depending on the circumstances of our return, regarding clothing - I sent word in the letter of the 6th, but today nothing is clear. By around the 6th, perhaps we will understand the situation a little? Though I said to prepare lined garments and such, they are quite expensive and cannot be made. Therefore, to send what is available, this matter is for next month

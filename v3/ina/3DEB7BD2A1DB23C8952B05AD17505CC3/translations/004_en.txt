【Continued from previous page】
Each [official] shall take to heart the sovereign's intentions and carefully
consider the written directives from the Kyōhō and
Kansei periods, thoroughly understanding their respective duties. Even matters that have been
customary until now, if they conflict with proper
procedures, shall be reformed,
and all things shall be conducted on the righteous path
for His Lordship's benefit first and foremost, so that
he may rest at ease. [Officials] shall exert themselves diligently in
this matter.

Addendum:
　Beginning with the Kyōhō and Kansei periods, there are some
　who regard the various decrees that have been
　issued repeatedly as merely routine matters—what is the point of
　such [an attitude]? Particularly since matters concerning official appointments serve as
　examples for public conduct, all [officials] should
　thoroughly understand [their duties], and even when new appointments are
　decreed, they should exert themselves diligently without treating [their duties] lightly

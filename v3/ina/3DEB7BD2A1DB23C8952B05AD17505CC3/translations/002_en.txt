The purport of the sovereign's will:
Regarding governmental affairs,
the intentions of successive generations are naturally
to be followed, but particularly the
intentions of the Kyōhō and Kansei [eras] should not be
violated from their very foundations,
therefore all should deeply understand and
carry out their duties accordingly.

　　The purport of what the Council of Elders conveyed:
Regarding the Kansei [reforms], at the time of the initial governance, concerning
the proper understanding of various sectors,
there was a profound sovereign decree, and those who were
informed at that time should all
uniformly understand these matters. However, as years and months have
passed, and in various places those who have long
served have become few in number,
the sovereign's intentions may naturally have been
lost, and attention to previous regulations has grown
thin, with focus on immediate conveniences

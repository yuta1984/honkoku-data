was appointed.

1. On the 10th day of the 8th month of Tenpō 7, Hinoe-Saru (1836), he was not only a person who failed to manage household affairs properly, but was also heard to have engaged in questionable handling of guaranteeing massive loans of improper money. Moreover, he engaged in bold misconduct unsuitable for someone in a position serving daily in close proximity to his lord, which could bring complete shame upon the house - this was utterly inexcusable and extremely insubordinate. While severe punishment should have been imposed, through special mercy, his stipend was confiscated, he was granted permanent leave, and was forbidden from loitering around both the upper and lower residences as well as the vicinity of the domain.

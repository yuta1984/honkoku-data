One: Yesterday evening, an official letter signed by the rōjū (senior councilors) arrived stating that there was official business with Yamato-no-kami of the same family name, and that I should attend the castle tomorrow, the 25th, at the hour of the Snake (around 10 AM). However, due to illness, I attended the castle as a representative at the hour of the Dragon (around 8 AM), wearing fukusa kosode and hemp kamishimo.
　　Since this was my first time appearing as a representative, the previous evening I had a messenger request assistance from Abe Suruga-dono through someone of the same family name. Fortunately, Suruga-dono was also appearing as a representative for Kuchiki Shichisuke-dono, so I requested his guidance in this auspicious circumstance.
One: As usual, I went to the waiting room, and from there attended the seat when the senior councilors entered the castle.
One: From there, Suruga-dono went to the Kiku-no-ma (Chrysanthemum Room) and told us to observe the seat for receiving instructions and the seat for receiving gifts, so we all went there and observed.
One: Soon after, the metsuke (inspector) Hijikata Hachijūrō came to show us a document listing the groups of people who would be present for today's reception of wild geese from the shogun's falconry, so I reviewed it. The groupings were as follows:
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Matsudaira Tamba-no-kami
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Honda Shimōsa-no-kami
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Mizuno Sakon-shōgen
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Ōta Settsu-no-kami
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Itakura Awa-no-kami

Regarding the Submission of a Certificate

One woman

The aforementioned person is undoubtedly my mother. On this occasion, I wish to send her to my relative at Shimizuya Zennosuke's place in Okukawa-cho, Fukagawa, Edo. I petitioned for a certificate for passage through the Tsurase checkpoint, which was graciously approved, and I have gratefully and certainly received the certificate that was bestowed upon me. Regarding this woman, should any troublesome matters arise in the future, I will go anywhere necessary to resolve them promptly and will not cause any inconvenience to the authorities. This certificate is for future reference, as stated above.

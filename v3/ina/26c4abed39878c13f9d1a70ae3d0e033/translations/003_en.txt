For the auspicious occasion of the New Year, we have received and read your thoughtful letter extending even to our retainers. We are truly delighted to know that you have welcomed the New Year in good health without incident. We too have passed another year without particular troubles. Despite being in distant lands, we deeply appreciate that you keep us in your thoughts. We are most grateful and words cannot express our gratitude sufficiently.

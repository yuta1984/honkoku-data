On the 15th, he made a pilgrimage to the Buddhist hall at Momijiyama, and the weather was favorable - truly a joyous occasion.
We understand that there are no unusual matters in your area, and that the Imperial Palace and court are safe.

1. Regarding the shortage of silver funds needed by Sentō and Nyōin (retired emperors and empresses), instructions were given to Kobori Niemon as in previous years, but there was insufficient payment.

1. Regarding the recent birth of a young prince at Sentō, the head priest of Chion-in has petitioned concerning the matter of succession to the temple's gatehouse quarters. While we wonder if there might be direct agreements with imperial family members other than Sentō, we understand that this matter has been acknowledged for now and greetings have been exchanged.
Furthermore, we commend you for carrying out your duties safely without incident.
All here are well without exception.

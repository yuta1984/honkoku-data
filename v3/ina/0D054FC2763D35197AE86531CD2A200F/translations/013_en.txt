After the sake vessels made two rounds, both men withdrew and respectfully suggested that [the lord] partake of the sake, then withdrew from their seats. 【Red ink】《Marginal note: Regarding the greetings at this place, when serving on September 21st of Hōreki 10 (1760), they did not withdraw》
Seeing that the elder councilors were appearing as envoys, when the elders withdrew, both men withdrew and made their report. After all the ceremonial meals were finished, the junior councilors withdrew from their seats.
The announcer-attendants respectfully welcomed [the lord] and immediately took their positions as advance guides.
The certain individual remained at the location shown in the diagram, followed in the wake [of the procession], and remained at the place where he would respectfully welcome [the lord] upon his entrance.
Greetings were exchanged only with Lord Mito.

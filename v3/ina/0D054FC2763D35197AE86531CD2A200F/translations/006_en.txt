1. After completing preparations with the sword and ceremonial umbrella, I went to the Goose Room and waited at the designated spot. Before long, one guard captain and middle palace attendants responsible for service arrived and were seated in the Hibiscus Room. Lord Sahyoe-no-suke came and said he would provide guidance, so I waited as planned to greet them.

1. With Lord Sahyoe-no-suke leading, Lord Owari Dainagon, Lord Kii Chunagon, and Lord Mito Shosho made their appearance with formal greetings, and took their seats at the designated spots for their passage. Following behind them, Lord Sahyoe-no-suke, myself, and the guard captains took our seats at the designated spots. Before long, Kyogoku Bizen-no-kami, one of the young elders, arrived and took his seat at the designated spot, and the meal was served.

1. After the meal was served, the elders came out and formal greetings were exchanged. Since the young elders had also come out in the same manner in previous years, I inquired with the inspector. He confirmed that indeed there were no greetings, and Lord Bizen, who was present, explained that in previous years there had been greetings in the same manner as the elders, but according to recent precedent, they do not come out. Understanding this, after one round with the ceremonial bowls was completed, Lord Sahyoe-no-suke and I withdrew as planned and offered parting greetings that they should take their time dining.

1. After one round with the sake cups was completed, both of us withdrew, offered that they should partake of the sake, and left our seats. Again, one round of sake cups was served, and ceremonial stands and presentation stands were brought out. When Lord Ando Tsushima-no-kami arrived, Lord Sahyoe-no-suke greeted him, and Lord Sahyoe-no-suke announced that Lord Tsushima-no-kami had come as an envoy. Then all the dining utensils were cleared away, the young elders withdrew, Lord Sahyoe-no-suke performed the farewell greeting as planned, and immediately led the way for their departure. I remained in position as planned. The Three Houses each offered their individual greetings and departed. Since no one remained afterward, with the mindset of standing guard, I proceeded from their former location to the vicinity of the Sakura Room.

Regarding the memorial service for the imperial court that we heard about yesterday, we have considered various matters but have no immediate opinions to offer. However, concerning the distribution of rice and pardoning of minor offenders that was carried out during the first anniversary memorial service for retired Emperor Go-Sai some years ago, we have found a copy of the written statement submitted by Tsuchiya Sagami-no-kami, which we would like to present for your reference. Of course, we have not yet made any formal report on this matter.

I stated this and withdrew, returned to the original reception room, exchanged greetings with the executive and caretaker, and departed immediately.
Everyone saw me off as they had greeted me upon arrival.

1. Regarding the ceremonial sword to be brought during the audience in Edo, since the horse deputy was ill, it was not presented
at that time, so I brought it here. After consultation with the temple lodging Shōson-in, I brought it today.

1. Going to the shrine, I dismounted at the stone torii slope below the Niō gate {{retainers
remained at this location}}. From here inward,
I took only the chamberlain, caretaker, and palanquin attendant, and the deputy of Shōson-in came out to greet at the Niō gate and
provided guidance. At the water basin to the left of the bronze torii within the Niō gate, I performed ritual purification, and at the
goose-step slope below Yōmei-mon gate, I changed into straw sandals. From here inward, I took the chamberlain, caretaker, and two sword
bearers, and at the gate entrance of the same location, I had my sword taken and carried by the head attendant. Shōson-in came out to greet at this place and
attended to various matters. A monk deputy from Dairaku-in and shrine personnel explained tomorrow's proceedings,
and Shōson-in
also went and gave detailed explanations. After viewing the shrine and its precincts, I withdrew via the previous
route and mounted my palanquin at the slope below the stone torii.
From there, I went to inspect the interior of the mausoleum and dismounted at Hokke-dō hall. Inside, I took only the chamberlain,
caretaker, and palanquin attendant, and the deputy of Shōson-in came out to greet at the Niō gate and
provided guidance. At the water basin to the right within the gate of the same location, I performed ritual purification, and at the goose-step
slope below Yasha-mon gate, I changed straw sandals. From here inward, I took the chamberlain, caretaker, and two sword bearers,
and at the gate entrance of the same location, I had my sword taken and carried by the head attendant. Shōson-in came out to greet at this place, and from here
inward
attended to all matters. Ryūkō-in came out to greet within the Chinese-style gate, and tomorrow's
deputy ceremony procedures were explained in detail.
The arrangements for the location where I would serve as deputy at the treasure pagoda were explained {{the treasure pagoda
cannot be inspected inside}}. After finishing,
I viewed the mausoleum and withdrew. Guided by the deputy of Shōson-in, I toured various places including Shingū, Jigen Daishi,
Takio, Sōmen Falls, and Sanhon-sugi, then stopped at Shōson-in where meals were
served and I received the strong rice ceremony. I ordered my retainers to join the meal. I returned to the lodging before evening.

Twentieth day - Light rain, clear weather from before noon
1. From the lodging {{wearing formal court dress,
the bestowed crested noshi-me garment, carrying a chūkei fan}} I departed before dawn, past seven and a half hour.
I dismounted at Hokke-dō hall of the mausoleum. From this area, there were gradually lower-ranking people present, so formal greetings were unnecessary. From here inward, I took only the palanquin attendant and proceeded to the Niō gate where the deputy of Shōson-in
came out to greet and provide guidance.
From in front of the mausoleum, I went to Ryūkō-in as a waiting area, entered the reception room, and Nikkō

1. I also went to Lord Mizuno Dewa-no-kami and expressed gratitude in the guest reception room, then went through the main service area to offer congratulations and inquire about his well-being.
1. In addition, I went to offer congratulations to the standby senior retainers before their castle attendance, but was refused meetings at all three places, so I left my thanks with their stewards and returned home.
1. This evening, I was summoned by a deputy from Lord Izu-no-kami, and when I went, the inquiry document I submitted this morning was approved with an official note saying it should follow precedent.
1. Before 8:30, a jointly signed official letter arrived from duty officer Matsudaira Izu-no-kami as follows: Tomorrow you will be granted leave for Nikkō, so you should attend the castle at 6:30. End

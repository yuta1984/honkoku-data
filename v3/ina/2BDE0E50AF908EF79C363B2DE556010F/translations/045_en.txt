Shōson-in had arrived earlier, and two attendants came out to greet at the main entrance in the lower seating area on thin mats.
The executive Engaku-in, caretaker Jōdo-in, the gate master's house administrator and others came out to greet at the ceremonial platform,
provided guidance, and exchanged customary greetings. I carried my sword up and took my seat.
After placing it outside the threshold along the veranda of the reception room and taking my seat, I stated the following to the executive:
　　　　In Edo,

"The Shōgun and Dainagon are increasingly in good spirits," I reported the message from the council of elders, and then stated that this time
I was appointed as deputy, and that my personal worship at the shrine and mausoleum was
completed as planned, for which I am grateful. Since I arrived earlier,
I received a gift through a messenger as an inquiry after my travels, and tomorrow
I was told that a meal will be provided, which I consider a most gracious honor.
I stated the above.
　　　However, regarding the tea and tobacco trays, I requested to view them now during the audience,
　　　and conducted an inspection accompanied by two people. Shōson-in came out to facilitate this.

1. When the executive informed me that the gate master would grant an audience, I carried my sword and when passing to the seating chamber,
I placed it at the side entrance area, and when proceeding to the seating chamber, I took my fan at the threshold and
withdrew to the center. When he acknowledged me, I entered within the threshold of the upper chamber.
I reported "The Shōgun and Dainagon are increasingly in good spirits," and stated "The gate master is
increasingly in good health, which I humbly consider a precious matter."
The gate master offered kelp, and I approached his side with sword still at my waist, received it respectfully, and
withdrew to my original seat. Facing the attendant, I stated "Earlier I received a gift through a messenger, and furthermore tomorrow I was told a meal
will be provided, and moreover when I came to pay my respects you granted me an audience, which I consider a most gracious honor."
After stating this, I withdrew and returned to the original reception room, exchanged greetings with the executive and caretaker, and departed immediately.
Everyone saw me off as they had greeted me upon arrival.

1. Regarding the ceremonial sword to be brought during audience in Edo, since the horse deputy was ill it was not presented
at that time, so I brought it here. After consultation with the temple lodging Shōson-in, I brought it today.

1. Going to the shrine, I dismounted at the stone torii slope below the Niō gate {{retainers remained at this location}}. From here inward,
I took only the chamberlain, caretaker, and palanquin attendant, and the deputy of Shōson-in came out to greet at the Niō gate and
provided guidance. At the water basin to the left of the Niō gate and bronze torii, I performed ritual purification, then Yōmei

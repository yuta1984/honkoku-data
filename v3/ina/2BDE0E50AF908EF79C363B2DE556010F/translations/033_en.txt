1. I shall refrain from external duties starting today


　　　　8th day
1. This morning I left home at 6 o'clock and attended the castle, wearing noshi-me hakama.
　　　However, the inrō was not used, as I was told to refrain from using it in the sitting room.
　　　　Though I had previously requested permission for tabi, I did not use them.
1. I sent word through a servant to the inspector that I had attended the castle, whereupon Matsudaira Iori conveyed his acknowledgment. When duty officer Izu-no-kami attended the castle, I went to my seat and waited. Soon inspector Watanabe Kyūzō told me to approach, and I took my seat in the Yamabuki room behind the sliding doors at the threshold edge of the Hame room. The festival ceremony official also took his seat next to mine.
1. When the guard gate opened, I went to the eastern veranda under Watanabe Kyūzō's guidance, where Toda Bingo-no-kami was also present with the group. Immediately under the guidance of wakadoshiyori Tachibana Izumo-no-kami, on the 17th the representative festival ceremony officials all waited together outside the cedar doors at the second turn of the guard gate. When duty officer Izu-no-kami appeared, following the wakadoshiyori's instructions, everyone entered inside the cedar doors and sat in order with the left side elevated. Izu-no-kami announced to the group that they would be granted gifts, and after Toda Bingo-no-kami expressed gratitude, under Izumo-no-kami's guidance we turned south in the corridor, removed our short swords and fans, and placed them to the left. Toda Bingo-no-kami, myself, and all the festival ceremony officials entered inside the White Heron cedar doors and waited in order near the inner sliding doors. After Bingo-no-kami's audience was completed, there was an exchange of courtesies with Izumo-no-kami, and I positioned myself near the sliding doors, sat at the threshold edge of the inner chamber, then slid forward and prostrated myself. Only Izu-no-kami's name was announced, the shogun responded to this, and he advanced before His Lordship.

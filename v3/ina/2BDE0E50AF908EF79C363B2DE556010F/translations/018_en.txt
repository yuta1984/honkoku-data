I received the ceremonial sword and horse fee from the caretaker's attendant, put the folding fan in my breast, and brought these offerings.

I entered the main shrine, ascended the stairs, and on the veranda witnessed the ceremonial sword and inventory being placed in the inner sanctuary, then performed worship. The shrine attendant brought out the sacred offerings, and at that time I entered within the threshold and remained respectfully waiting.

When the sacred offerings were brought before me, there was guidance to prostrate and receive them. I sat on the left side of the stone area in front of the inner sanctuary with hands placed respectfully, and at that time sacred sake cups were brought out and I received the sacred sake. After finishing, I handed the sake cup to Shōson-in, withdrew to the veranda as initially, exchanged greetings with the magistrate and head priest, and departed. Outside the Karamon Gate, I adjusted my hakama cords, departed, and descended the mountain, then proceeded directly to the head temple. I dismounted at the stone steps on the paved stone area. Shōson-in had gone ahead and came out to greet me at the entrance platform. In addition, the temple administrator, caretakers, and the temple head's retainers also came out to greet and guide me. I sat down briefly and exchanged greetings. My sword was taken up from the lower seat, and I ascended to the mirror board area. After untying my cords outside the right cedar doors and waiting, the magistrate came out from inside the cedar doors to greet me. Under the guidance of the temple administrator and caretaker, I was shown to the [blank] room, removed my formal court robe, and changed into long hakama. At that time, I first sent attendants of both caretakers.

1. After changing clothes was completed, through Shōson-in I called out Magistrate Tsuchiya Chikugo-no-kami, and in the changing room I handed him the dispatch to Edo, requesting that it be sent from the lodging. The dispatches had been sealed yesterday, both copies. Both copies were brought by retainers, the one with good weather conditions was sent out, and the one without good conditions was opened as a precaution. The dispatch read as follows:

　I humbly write this letter
　The Shogun and Right General are in increasingly good spirits, which brings great joy.
　I arrived at Nikko yesterday on the 19th, met with Tsuchiya Chikugo-no-kami
　and delivered the official letter. This morning at
　the mausoleum, the Buddhist service proceeded according to proper ritual, even the weather was favorable, and everything was completed successfully
　without any shortcomings. I performed the worship as imperial representative and departed from here immediately. I shall report further
　upon my return. With utmost reverence and respect.

　　April 20th　　　　　　　Naitō Yamato-no-kami

　　To Lord Doi Ōi-no-kami
　　To Lord Aoyama Shimotsuke-no-kami
　　To Lord Abe Bitchū-no-kami

After this was completed, under the temple administrator's guidance I was shown to the waiting room. My sword was placed beside the alcove platform, and I sat in front of the alcove as shown in the diagram. In the lower part of the opposite seating area, the magistrate and attending physician sat and waited. Meanwhile, the temple administrator and caretaker attended, so I stated that I had successfully performed my duties as imperial representative, which brought great joy, and also requested to view the reception rooms. Immediately the temple administrator, caretaker, and Shōson-in

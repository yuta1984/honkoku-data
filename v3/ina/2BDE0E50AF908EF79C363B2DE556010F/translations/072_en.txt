When this was completed, the duty officer moved over to sit near the pillar at the corner of the Fuyo room veranda as usual, and the elders took their seats near the lateral sliding doors. I went out to sit beside the duty officer, and the duty officer took his seat on the second tatami mat with the Kari room behind him. The gift officer brought out time garments and five haori coats placed on a broad cover, set them down, and withdrew. Senior Inspector Hori Zushu paid his respects, and I went out to the first tatami mat as usual, prostrated myself in front of the granted items, turned slightly toward the duty officer, expressed gratitude for humbly receiving the granted items, finished, and withdrew. When the gift officer took away the granted items, Lord Bizen, wearing court dress, passed through the sliding doors to take his seat at the veranda of the scribes' room, while the other elders withdrew through the narrow corridor. Following after them, I hurried through the narrow corridor, slipped past the side of the elders on duty shift, rushed to the middle room and took my usual seat. Subsequently, the off-duty elders withdrew and took their seats in the same place as shown in the diagram. At that moment, I took my fan, advanced slightly, and received the command "permission to depart for Nikko is granted." I expressed gratitude for humbly receiving the granted items, and the off-duty elders retired to the inner chambers.

1. When Lord Bizen finished receiving his instructions at the veranda of the scribes' room and the granted items ceremony was completed, at the time of withdrawal, I expressed gratitude as before, and when he retired to the inner chambers, I entered the room.

1. I announced to my fellow officials about the leave permission and granted items, and they also offered their congratulations.

1. I changed into dragon-gate hakama and withdrew. After making courtesy calls to the senior and junior officials, I returned home before eight o'clock.
　　However, Lord Iga-no-kami was unable to receive courtesy calls due to other engagements.

The verbal statement was as follows:
　　　　I have today been granted permission to depart for Nikko and have received the command, and I humbly and gratefully received the granted items.
　　　　I hereby pay my respects for the above.

1. To the young elders, I submitted a verbal statement saying "I hereby pay my respects accordingly."

After withdrawal, I sent word to Kawachi, the former duty roster coordinator, regarding the matter of duty exemption.

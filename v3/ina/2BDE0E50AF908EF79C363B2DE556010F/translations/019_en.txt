After this was completed, under the temple administrator's guidance I was shown to the waiting room. My sword was placed beside the alcove platform, and I sat in front of the alcove as shown in the diagram and remained waiting. Meanwhile, the temple administrator and caretaker attended, so I stated that I had successfully performed my duties as imperial representative, which brought great joy, and also requested to view the reception rooms. Immediately I toured them in the company of the temple administrator, caretaker, and Shōson-in, learned about the procedures for sake cups and such, and returned to my original seat.

Soon, under the temple administrator's guidance, I brought my sword and proceeded to the audience chamber. The sword and fan were placed inside the entrance-side sliding doors, and I proceeded as shown in the diagram. However, since the temple head was currently engaged in Buddhist services, the initial audience was declined, which Ryūō-in conveyed to me. The temple administrator and both caretakers came out and informed me that a meal would be served. Shortly after, the meal was brought on plain wooden utensils to outside the threshold of the next room. I requested the temple administrator to have it replaced with better service, and it was quickly replaced with lacquered wooden utensils. Outside the threshold, the magistrate and attending physician were seated, and a meal similar to mine was served.

1. When the meal was ready, the temple officials, administrator, and caretakers came, and there were greetings for everyone from myself to the magistrate and attending physician to partake, which we did.

1. When the second course was replaced with soup, sake, and such, the temple administrator and caretakers offered greetings and we partook.
　　However, during the meal, the temple administrator, caretakers, family stewards and others came out and moved various serving stands around, but this varies depending on the occasion.

1. After finishing the soup and sake, the temple head made his appearance. I turned toward the temple head and faced the temple administrator, saying that I had completed my duties as imperial representative without incident, and that I was deeply grateful for performing my worship as well. I expressed thanks for the meal, whereupon sake cups were brought out and sake bottles produced. When I moved to the center, the meal table was removed to the side. When the temple head received the first drink, an attendant brought a sake cup on a stand before me, so I asked the attendant to set down the cup, which was done, and I received the first drink. The temple head offered side dishes, so I approached his side still wearing my sword, received them, and withdrew to my original place. When I requested to pour in return, he instructed me to return the cup, so I declined through the temple administrator, but when he insisted again, I poured sake into the cup and handed it to the attendant. The attendant placed the cup on the stand and presented it to the temple head. Seeing him take it in his hands, I waited for the appropriate moment, and after the attendant withdrew the cup, the temple head retired to his quarters. Returning to the meal as before, the second soup course was replaced with sweet soup, and after finishing with hot water, sweets were served twice in the latter part, and after tea was finished, I withdrew to my original seat. Soon the temple head appeared again, so under the caretaker's guidance, as with yesterday's audience, I sat at the threshold edge, then proceeded as before, turned toward the temple administrator and received the meal

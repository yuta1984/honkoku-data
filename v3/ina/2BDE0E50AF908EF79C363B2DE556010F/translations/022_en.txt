After a while, Lord Bitchū-no-kami finished his duties, the public affairs official came out and instructed me to proceed to the front. I brought my written report and waited in attendance, and before long Lord Bitchū-no-kami appeared in the guest reception room. When the public affairs official opened the sliding doors, I took my fan at the entrance, announced my name and appeared.
I stated whether His Lordship the Shogun and the Right General were increasingly in good health, and the Lord replied that they were in good health, to which I expressed that this was most gratifying. Then, on the past 20th day, at Nikkō I successfully performed the proxy worship at the Sacred Mausoleum, and the sacred mountain grounds were in perfect safety. I delivered the official letter to the Nikkō magistrate and conveyed the message.
When I conveyed the message to the temple administrator and had audience with the temple head, the aforementioned greetings took place.

After stating the above, Lord Bitchū-no-kami handed me the following written order:
　　Official letter half-cut paper
　　　　　　　　　　　Naitō Yamato-no-kami [This official letter's cover writing]
　　　　Tomorrow the 24th, regarding your return from Nikkō,
　　　　you are ordered to have audience, so at half past five
　　　　you shall attend the castle. That is all.
　　　　　April 23rd
　I viewed this and stated that I humbly accepted it, placing the document beside the tatami.

　Regarding the formal address for the audience, I stated that I would submit an inquiry as to whether I should speak as before, and submitted the following document:
　　
　　On the past 20th day at Nikkō, regarding the Sacred Mausoleum
　　proxy worship, I successfully performed my duties, even the weather was
　　favorable and everything was completed without any shortcomings.
　　I humbly inquire whether I should make the above formal address.
　　　　April 23rd　　　　　　Naitō Yamato-no-kami

　He received this and said I should understand as before, so I stated that I acknowledged this, and the document was retained. Then I lowered my demeanor, and when I said he seemed increasingly vigorous, he also inquired about my well-being. After this was completed, I stated that this time I had served without delay as proxy at the Nikkō Sacred Mausoleum, and that I had also performed my own worship at the Sacred Shrine and Sacred Mausoleum, which I considered a most fortunate circumstance. I then withdrew from my seat and immediately departed. From there I made rounds to the senior councillors of both citadels and conveyed everything to them.
After completing this, I arrived at the residence after half past nine.
1. I sent notification letters to the senior inspector and inspectors whom I had asked for assistance.
1. To Oki-no-kami, I sent a messenger to announce my arrival.

1. After arriving, I also gave direct replies to the messenger from Deputy Oki-no-kami and the messenger from close relatives.
1. Only to my colleagues of the same rank, I had the caretaker send notification of my return to the capital and that there had been an order for tomorrow's audience, using an official notice.
1. I sent notification messengers to the junior councillors and chamberlains of both citadels.

One, Wearing fukusa awase half-hakama, I left home a little after 7:30 and went to see Abe Bitchu-no-kami-dono, who was on duty.

One, The steward called me and I stated that I had come to express gratitude for being appointed Nikko deputy representative on the 20th day. Soon Bitchu-dono entered the audience chamber, the steward opened the sliding doors, I entered and announced my name at the threshold of the audience area. I expressed gratitude for being appointed Nikko deputy representative on the 20th day. Regarding this, I submitted an inquiry document along with two wrapped documents together. Bitchu-dono reviewed them, gave a brief acknowledgment, and immediately withdrew from his seat. Then I proceeded to the informal area where Bitchu-no-kami-dono appeared and exchanged seasonal greetings. Since there were other guests present as well, I joined in to announce my news and also inquired about everyone's well-being before withdrawing.

One, I also visited Doi Ooi-no-kami-dono, Mizuno Dewa-no-kami-dono, and Okubo Kaga-no-kami-dono, proceeded to their informal areas to announce my news and inquired about their well-being, returning home after 5:30.

One, I was supposed to visit Aoyama Shimotsuke-no-kami-dono, but since the main gate was under repair and it was before the formal audience session, I did not visit and instead sent a messenger to convey my announcement.

One, The inquiry document I submitted this morning was as follows:

　　　Departing from here on the coming 16th day, arriving at Nikko on the same 19th day,
　　　performing the deputy representative duties on the 20th day,
　　　and returning to the capital on the 23rd day is the established precedent.
　　　Should I follow the same procedure this time as well? I humbly inquire.

1. Wearing court dress with half-hakama, I departed after half past seven and went to the duty officer Lord Abe Bitchu-no-kami.
　The steward called me out, and I stated that I had come to pay respects having been appointed as Nikko deputy on the twentieth day. Before long, Lord Bitchu came out to the guest reception room, the steward opened the sliding doors, I came forward to the threshold of the guest reception room, announced my name, and came forward. I expressed my gratitude for being appointed as Nikko deputy on the twentieth day, and regarding this matter, I submitted a written inquiry. Being in an outer wrapper, I submitted two documents together. Lord Bitchu examined them, there was a brief acknowledgment, and I immediately withdrew from my seat.
　From there I went through to his private quarters, Lord Bitchu-no-kami came out and there were seasonal greetings, and since there were other guests present as well, I took the opportunity to spread word of my appointment and inquired about his well-being before withdrawing.
1. I also went to Lord Doi Oi-no-kami, Lord Mizuno Dewa-no-kami, and Lord Okubo Kaga-no-kami, went through to their private quarters, spread word of my appointment and inquired about their well-being, returning home after half past five.

1. I was to visit Lord Aoyama Shimotsuke-no-kami, but since the main gate was under repair at this time and formal audiences were suspended, I did not visit but sent word of my appointment through a messenger.
1. The written inquiry I submitted this morning was as follows:

　　　Departing here on the coming 16th day, arriving at Nikko on the same 19th day,
　　　serving as deputy on the 20th day,
　　　and returning on the 23rd day is the established precedent.
　　　Should I understand that this time will follow exactly the same procedure? I humbly inquire.

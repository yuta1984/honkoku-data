　　　7th day
1. Left home two hours before the sixth hour and went to pay respects to the duty officer Matsudaira Izu-no-kami for being appointed as Nikkō representative for the 20th day. Wore sha awase (silk gauze lined kimono) with hemp kamishimo.

1. As usual, I waited in the corridor for receiving guests. Soon Lord Izu-no-kami appeared, so I came forward to express gratitude for being appointed as Nikkō representative for the 20th day and submitted the following inquiry document. I did not use formal colored paper but kept it in my pocket, submitting only the inquiry document. Lord Izu-no-kami said he would receive and hold it. After withdrawing, I went through the middle service area to offer congratulations and inquire about his well-being.

1. The inquiry document I submitted was as follows:
　　　　Regarding the worship ceremony I will perform as representative at Nikkō on the 20th day, should I wear daimon formal attire according to precedent?

　　　1. After serving as representative, I would like to personally worship at the shrine and mausoleum.

　　　　I humbly inquire about the above. End
　　　　　April 7th　　　　　　Naitō Yamato-no-kami

　　　　The precedent is to depart from here on the 16th, arrive at Nikkō on the 19th of the same month, serve as representative on the 20th, and return to Edo on the 23rd. Should I follow the same schedule this time as well? I humbly inquire. End

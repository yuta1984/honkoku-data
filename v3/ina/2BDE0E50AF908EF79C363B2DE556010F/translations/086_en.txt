- Since Ekō-in, the chief representative of the entire mountain complex, was away for hot spring therapy, went to Kannon-in and had sweets and soup before meeting. When inquiring about Kannon-in's well-being, exchanged greetings as he was in good health, and when he returned to his temple, escorted him as far as the next room.

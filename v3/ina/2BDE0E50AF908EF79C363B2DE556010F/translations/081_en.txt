I took my seat at the second tatami mat on the eastern side of the yokotatami, and the ōmetsuke officials similarly moved and took their seats next to the duty officer. I calculated the timing and moved from the Naka-no-ma to position myself near the folding screen in front of the threshold of the Haname-no-ma. From there, the head of the front secretaries brought out an official document (hōsho) on a small lacquered tray and placed it in front of Lord Kii before withdrawing. The metsuke bowed, and I moved forward two tatami mats in front of Lord Kii and sat down. When the official document was handed over, I went before His Lordship to receive it, returned to my original seat, and placed the document at my side. When I inquired whether I should understand the message to the Nikkō magistrate in the usual manner, I received the usual greeting in response, so I immediately passed through the Kikyō-no-ma, and since a caretaker was waiting outside the central corridor, I handed over the document and told him to withdraw at his convenience before retiring to my room.
　However, since the gate master was not present at the mountain at this time, I did not inquire about the message to the temple administrator.

First, the assistant officers Lord Echizen, Lord Harima, Ukyō, Izu, Lord Settsu, and Lord Nagato each reported their farewell visits, so I also made appropriate greetings in return.

First, Lord Harima and Izu departed together. After that, I went to see Lord Kii, the duty officer, reported yesterday's departure notice at the entrance, made farewell remarks upon returning, and also visited other off-duty senior officials to bid farewell, bringing written statements and presenting them at their entrances.
I returned home after eight o'clock.

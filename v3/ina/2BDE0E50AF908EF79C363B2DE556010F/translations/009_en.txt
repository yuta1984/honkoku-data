There was an official pronouncement: "You are appointed as Nikko deputy on the twentieth day." I prostrated myself, slid down from the upper platform, descended only to the first tatami and turned right, then seated myself on the first tatami at a position where my hands could reach the edge of the second tatami inside the threshold of the lower platform. Turning my face only toward the duty officer, there was an exchange: "Permission for departure to Nikko is granted. Moreover, you should be grateful for the official gifts." I turned right and withdrew. In the corridor I put on my short sword, and at the Seiko-no-ma veranda an inspector was present and asked "Is there any discomfort?" I replied that there was no discomfort. Immediately I seated myself in the narrow corridor outside the Oshidori cedar doors with the sliding doors behind me, and at the inspector's bow went to the Hame-no-ma room, seated myself in front of where the ceremonial covers for the official gifts were placed, prostrated myself, faced toward the chamberlain, and the chamberlain acknowledged my expression of gratitude for the official gifts. I prostrated myself again and withdrew.

1. After retiring from the castle, I sent word to Kawachi, the previous month's duty roster coordinator, regarding the matter of being relieved from duty.

1. Today I was granted leave as commanded, so I submitted two inquiry documents through my house steward to Lord Bizen-no-kami, who was on duty, as follows:

Nikko-san Sacred Mausoleum
Having been appointed as imperial representative and granted leave
as commanded, on what day should I depart from here?
1. Regarding travel days, there are precedents, and moreover as the days are becoming shorter,
   I would like to take four days to reach Nikko.
1. How many days should I serve as imperial representative?
I humbly inquire about the above matters.
September 22nd

On the 25th, the attached note was completed as follows:
Next month, depart from here on the 4th, and on the 8th
you shall serve as imperial representative.

Now that I have been granted leave to go to Nikko
as commanded, regarding attendance at court when summoned for duties before I depart from here and before my audience upon returning to Edo - since this is during leave granted for official business, how should I understand this matter? I humbly inquire about this point.

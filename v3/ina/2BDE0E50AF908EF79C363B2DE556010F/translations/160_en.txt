Today, for the audience (omemie) upon returning to Edo, I purified myself and (wearing the bestowed crested noshime half-formal attire) departed my residence after 5 o'clock and went to the castle. I sent word through a servant to the metsuke (inspector) that I had arrived at the castle, whereupon Morikawa Shuzen acknowledged this and replied. The officials on duty also came out and we conversed in the servant quarters.

There was an imperial word that my efforts during this period were greatly appreciated, and after another acknowledgment directed toward Lord Izu-no-kami, the ceremony concluded.

I turned to the right and withdrew, proceeding as initially to the yamabuki passage of the Hame-no-ma...

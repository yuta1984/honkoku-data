1. For tomorrow morning's courtesy visits to the duty officers of both citadels to express gratitude for the departure permission and official gifts, I applied through the caretaker. However, due to the death of Lord Yōshichirō, there would be no formal reception, but due to urgent matters, there would be a meeting before going to the castle.
　　　Note: I also applied regarding the temporary adoption petition for the time being.
　　　Same month, 11th day
1. Wearing fukusa awase hemp formal dress, I left home at the fifth hour and visited Duty Officer Lord Bitchū-no-kami. I went to the servants' quarters, called out a retainer, stated my business, and also mentioned that I would soon submit a temporary adoption petition.

1. Soon a retainer guided me to the reception room where I met Lord Bitchū-no-kami. I expressed gratitude for the departure permission and official gifts, mentioned that I had submitted a temporary adoption petition, and presented it. Lord Bitchū-no-kami opened the seal, read it, and responded that he would "respectfully receive it." I withdrew, called out a retainer, and expressed gratitude that the temporary adoption petition had been received without incident. I then visited Lord Noto-no-kami, expressed similar gratitude in the reception room, also met in the servants' quarters, made my own announcements, and returned home at half past the fifth hour.

1. For the audience with the Nikko head priest, I wore noshime hemp formal dress and left home at the eighth hour to visit Engakuin temple, the lodging temple at Ueno.

1. I arranged with Engakuin to "just observe," and when we went to the main temple, I was guided by an attendant, passed through carrying my sword, and after being seated, I set my sword aside. Since Engakuin also came to serve as intermediary, I consulted with him to understand the protocol for the audience.

1. Soon the official in charge appeared, so I stated: "This time I have been honored with the appointment as Nikko deputy on the twentieth day, which is a most fortunate situation. Moreover, I respectfully believe it is precious that the head priest remains in good health. I am grateful that you will meet with me today, and I have come to pay my respects for this reason." I offered seasonal greetings, and since Ryūō-in would accompany us, I made appropriate arrangements for matters at Nikko.

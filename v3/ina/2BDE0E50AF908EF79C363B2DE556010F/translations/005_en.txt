One, The above written order was handed to the caretaker at the middle gate, and he took it back first.

One, Since Yokose Suruga-dono and Maeda Shinano-no-kami-dono were present near the veranda of the Kiku-no-ma (Chrysanthemum Room), I announced the news to them myself. They also announced that the deputy representative appointment had been ordered on the 17th day. Also, regarding the etiquette practice for the farewell ceremony in the Goza-no-ma, I asked for their help though it was not urgent, and they graciously agreed to arrange practice sessions.

　　　However, I also met with Nakajo Kawachi-no-kami-dono of the high-ranking retainers and made the same request.

One, I also went to Nishimaru to express gratitude, and had an audience with Morikawa Kii-no-kami-dono, who was on duty as master of ceremonies in the Kari-no-ma. Both myself and Oki appeared together, completed the ceremony, withdrew, and made rounds to the senior councilors and junior councilors of both compounds as a courtesy, returning home at 8 o'clock.

　　　10th day
1. Nothing of note occurred.

　　　11th day
1. This morning I was to visit Izu-no-kami, who was on duty, for courtesy calls, but I was unwell from the night and could not go. Since this was an inconvenient matter the day before departure, I sent a retainer to Izu-no-kami's residence and had him inform the chamberlain that if there were no courtesy calls on the coming 13th, I would visit before going to the castle.

1. Today, regarding the audience with the head priest of Nikkō that was arranged the day before yesterday, I was supposed to visit, but due to illness I sent a messenger to decline to the chief administrator of the main temple.

1. Nothing of note occurred.

　　　13th day
1. This morning before six o'clock I left home and visited Izu-no-kami, who was on duty, for courtesy calls. I completed expressing gratitude for receiving permission to travel to Nikkō in the audience chamber, then proceeded to the inner quarters to inquire about his health and expressed my gratitude again.

1. I also visited three other places - Mizuno Dewa-no-kami and other senior councilors who were off duty - before going to the castle, meeting with their chamberlains to express my gratitude.

1. The head priest of Nikkō departed for Nikkō yesterday. Since I declined the audience the day before yesterday to announce my appointment as representative, I should also visit the main temple

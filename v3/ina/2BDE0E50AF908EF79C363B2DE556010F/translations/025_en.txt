1. For expressing gratitude for performing the return audience to the capital
　and subsequently receiving the gracious command, I departed the residence after seven o'clock by about two sun, wearing formal wago-hakama half-hakama,
　and visited Lord Abe Bitchū-no-kami, the duty officer, as a caller. The public steward called me out, and I stated that I had come to express gratitude for the return
　audience and waited. Soon the public steward said he would open
　the cedar sliding doors of the reception room. Taking my fan at the entrance, I announced my name, stating that I had performed the return
　audience and
　expressing my gratitude for receiving the gracious command, then withdrew from my seat. I went to the side room and waited, and soon Lord Bitchū appeared,
　exchanging greetings about good health. At the reception area, as host at the entrance,
　
　he took in the fan, I made my announcement and departed. From there, I went to visit
　Lord Matsudaira Noto-no-kami of the Western Compound senior councilors, but since he was no longer receiving callers, I left word with his public steward about gratitude for the return
　audience and the gracious command, and returned home before five o'clock.
　　However, I had arranged through the caretaker the previous evening to meet with
　　Lords Bitchū-no-kami and Noto-no-kami.

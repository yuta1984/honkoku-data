1. Since Gakutō Shūgaku-in is also serving as imperial messenger this year, all handling matters are being managed by the imperial messenger's officials.

1. After completing the guest reception,

   Proceeded to the mausoleum and dismounted before Hokkadō. Outside the Imperial Plaque Gate, left the palanquin attendant behind and proceeded with the steward, caretaker, and two sword bearers. At the bottom of Gangi slope below Yaiba Gate, changed to straw sandals, handed over to the sword bearers on the wooden platform, and proceeded. Ryūkō-in came out to greet at this location, and tomorrow morning explained in detail the ceremony for serving as imperial representative. Tomorrow at the Treasure Pagoda - regarding serving as imperial representative, he informed that interior inspection of the Treasure Pagoda would not be possible. According to precedent, one would tour various places with lodging temple guidance, and although this was done repeatedly during the Temmei era, this time due to my foot pain, this was omitted. Went directly to the same temple where food was served, and returned to the inn before 7 o'clock.

1. Around the time lanterns were lit, departed directly from the inn wearing formal court dress (bestowed noshime) (brought along the middle road), dismounted before the mausoleum Hokkadō, and from here proceeded accompanied only by the steward, caretaker, and palanquin attendant. The lodging temple Hōmon-in and the deputy abbot came out to greet and guide us to Niō Gate. From before the mausoleum, proceeded to Bettō Ryūkō-in for a meeting, where the same temple greeted us and led us to the study. Tobacco trays were brought out, and we waited with them still tied. Since Mino-no-kami was unwell today and did not speak, and the deputy representative had not appeared recently, we conversed while waiting, but soon proceeded first to the deputy representative and Ryūkō-in.

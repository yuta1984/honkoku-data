1. There was no monthly ceremony of gratitude, but some nobles were taking leave, and there were extraordinary ceremonies of gratitude. All the others of the same rank left when the locked gate opened, but I alone remained waiting in my seat. Shortly after the ceremony of gratitude ended, Inspector Kojima Magonoemon told me to approach, so I waited by the sliding doors opposite the palanquin cedar doors at the entrance to the Yamabuki room. The duty officer Izu-no-kami appeared in the Tohame room, and I appeared at the inspector's instruction. When I inquired whether the delivery and receipt of the official letter to the Nikkō magistrate and the message to the magistrate's administrator should be conveyed according to precedent, I was told to understand it as such and to handle everything with great care. I withdrew from my seat and carefully informed the inspector that my business was completed and I would now leave. The official letter was handed over as I had brought a resident retainer from the castle with me.
　　　However, the white wooden box containing the official letter was carried out by the caretaker.

1. After leaving, I informed them that I would visit Senior Councilor Mizuno Dewa-no-kami to take my leave before departing tomorrow, and I verbally notified the duty officer Izu-no-kami of my departure tomorrow.

1. Since it was a purification matter upon leaving, I did not exchange greetings with those I encountered on the way, but sent word through a messenger.

1. I returned home after nine o'clock.

1. After returning home, my retainers came to the living room to examine the official letter to the Nikkō magistrate, and I immediately sealed it and handed it over to the retainers.

1. The official letter was as follows:
　　　　Naitō Yamato-no-kami is being sent as representative to the mausoleum on the twentieth of this month, so please consult accordingly.
　　　　With utmost respect and humble words
　　　　　　　　　　　　　Andō Tsushima-no-kami
　　　　April 15th　　　　　　（monogram）
　　　　　　　　　　　　　Toda Yamashiro-no-kami

　　　　　　　　　　　　　Matsudaira Izu-no-kami

　　　　　　To Lord Ōkubo Naizen-no-shō

1. Lord Ōta Bitchū-no-kami did not come to the castle due to illness and was excluded from the list.

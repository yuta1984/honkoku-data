October 7th

- Departed from Imaichi post station early at around 7 o'clock at dawn
- Arrived at Hachishi before 6 o'clock
- Took a bath, shaved hair, and dispatched messengers to announce arrival to the Nikko magistrate and temples, wearing noshime hakama and waiting in attendance
  However, since the gate master was in residence in Edo, no messenger was sent to the main temple. There were precedents from the Shotoku period and the Tenmei period, so no messenger was sent this time either
- Visited the lodging temple Homon-in, finished a meal in the reception room, then met and requested various matters
  However, he stayed directly at the honjin (main inn) and took care of various affairs
- Also met with the temple's deputy abbot and exchanged customary greetings

A copy of the above was also sent to deputy Matsudaira Kii-no-kami.

1. For expressing gratitude, I attended Nishinomaru castle and had an audience with Sōshaban Toba Tango-no-kami in the Kari-no-ma.

1. I made courtesy visits to the rōjū and wakadoshiyori to express gratitude, properly announcing myself at their entrance halls.

　　However, in previous years courtesy visits were not made to rōjū and wakadoshiyori who were in mourning, but in recent years no mention of purification has been made in official letters, so the understanding was to make courtesy visits even to those in ritual impurity without resolution. Moreover, at this time there were no conflicts among the rōjū and wakadoshiyori, so I made visits to all of them without exception.

1. Returned home after half past the ninth hour.

1. Yesterday evening, an official letter signed jointly by the rōjū arrived from Lord Izu-no-kami, the duty officer. Regarding attending the castle today, the appointment as Nikkō representative for the 20th was immediately circulated to colleagues on duty. Letters were sent to Ōta Settsu-no-kami and Andō Nagato-no-kami, and circular notices were sent out to others who were ill, young, or in their domains.

1. Having been appointed as Nikkō representative, following precedent, messengers were sent to inform and request assistance from the Nikkō gate master and other Nikkō magistrates, Kōzuke duty officers, monks of Tōzen-in, and the deputy governors in charge of Nakata and Fusagawa checkpoints along the Nikkō road.

1. The duty officer Matsudaira Izu-no-kami summoned my deputy and officially announced through a written document that I was exempted from Sotosukurada gate guard duty due to my appointment as representative. Accordingly, I personally paid respects only to Lord Izu-no-kami.

Lord Harima departed for Izu Province.

1. We sent word of his departure to the duty inspector (metsuke) through a monk as usual, and received acknowledgment from Aoki Shingobyōe.

2. The senior councilors (rōjū) entered the castle, were called by name to enter the middle chamber (nakanoma), and took their seats above the duty officials. I was called by name in the middle chamber and took my seat below my designated posting.
   Note: Since I had come out to meet the head chamberlain (dōbōgashira) to deliver a formal letter, I mentioned that I had made the usual notification.

3. Lords Ise-no-kami, Bizen-no-kami, and Izumi-no-kami appeared and exchanged courtesies, then the gentlemen withdrew to the inner chambers. Then Lords Iga-no-kami, Yamato-no-kami, and Kii-no-kami appeared and exchanged courtesies [still holding fans]. I advanced slightly and reported my departure to Lord Kii-no-kami, and after this was completed, I withdrew slightly. When the gentleman entered the inner chambers, I proceeded directly to the Fuyō Chamber.

4. Inspector Aoki Shinshichigen came and informed the duty officer of today's order of proceedings as follows:
   His Lordship's appearance in the Yamabuki Chamber with the junior councilors (wakadoshiyori) in waiting seats.
   From page Ogasawara Mimasaku-no-kami to chamberlain Naitō-sama's chief retainer - seven people received instructions together, then proceeded to the Tsutsuji Chamber where only Lord Kii-no-kami was seated, with attendants in the same arrangement. Instructions were given to falconer Takakura Shōnosuke, then only that gentleman proceeded to the Hame Chamber where a formal letter was presented to Honda Bunzen-no-kami.

5. Observing the situation of the rounds, I proceeded to the middle chamber and took a seat above the duty officials. Soon after, the off-duty senior councilors completed their withdrawal through the narrow corridor.

6. Soon Lord Kii-no-kami completed receiving instructions in the Tsutsuji Chamber, withdrew through the inner passage of the scribes' office, and made an appearance from the middle chamber to the Hame Chamber. For the duty officials, as usual, they proceeded from the direction of the Kikyō Chamber to the Hame Chamber.

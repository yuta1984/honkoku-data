Moving down slightly in seating, I said, "This time on the 20th I was appointed as deputy, for which I am most grateful.
Also, my personal worship at the shrine and mausoleum was completed as planned, for which I am also grateful." After this, I discussed "the matter of inspecting the interiors of the shrine and mausoleum."

I stated, "Please teach me the proper procedures for tomorrow morning's duties and provide guidance in all matters," and mentioned "Today I would like to visit and observe the main shrine and other locations." When departing, I escorted him to the next room.
　　　　However, tomorrow's notification letter regarding completion of the deputy duties will be sealed at the main temple.
　　　　　Though there is precedent, since tomorrow is imminent and there may not be enough time,
　　　　　I arranged to have my retainer coordinate and review the draft text before sealing it.

1. The Nikko deputy governors Ohara Okura and Kaneko Sukesaburo were seated facing the front of the study hall, lined up in the next room. They withdrew for conversation, and regarding my appointment as deputy, we exchanged greetings with "please rely on me favorably."

1. Regarding the sweets sent from the gate master through chamberlain Otoba Mino-no-kami as his messenger,

　After stating the above, I moved up slightly in seating to give my own greetings, and when he departed I escorted him to the ceremonial entrance.

1. After receiving guests was completed, I bathed for purification, put on formal dress (noshi-me half-dress), and departed after 9 o'clock to visit the main temple.
　　　However, I dismounted at the paved stone area below the stone slope.
　Shōson-in had arrived earlier and came out to greet at the main entrance. Two attendants came out to the thin mat in the lower seating area,
　and the executive Engaku-in, caretaker Jōdo-in, the gate master's house administrator and others came out to greet at the ceremonial platform,
　provided guidance, and exchanged customary greetings. I carried my sword up and took my seat.
　After placing it outside the threshold along the veranda of the reception room and taking my seat, I stated the following to the executive:

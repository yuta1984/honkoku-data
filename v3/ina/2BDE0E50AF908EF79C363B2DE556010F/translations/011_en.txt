1. I arranged with Engakuin to "just observe," and when we went to the main temple, I was guided by an attendant, passed through carrying my sword, and after being seated, I set my sword aside. Since Engakuin came to serve as intermediary, I consulted with him to understand the proper sequence for the audience.

1. Soon the official in charge appeared, so I stated: "This time I have been honored with the appointment as Nikko deputy on the twentieth day, which is a most fortunate situation. Moreover, I respectfully believe it is precious that the head priest remains in excellent health. I am grateful that you will meet with me today, and I have come to pay my respects for this reason." I offered seasonal greetings, and since Ryūō-in would accompany us, I made appropriate arrangements for matters at Nikko.

1. Soon the head priest appeared and took his seat. With the attendant's guidance, I went out to the lower platform's veranda and prostrated myself. The head priest briefly acknowledged me, and I entered the lower platform and prostrated myself, saying "I have been honored with the appointment as Nikko deputy on the twentieth day, which is most fortunate. I respectfully believe it is precious that the head priest remains in excellent health." He said "For the first time" and offered kelp by hand, so I advanced while still wearing my sword and received the kelp from his hand. At that time, the sword and horse money I had presented were brought by an attendant for display, and the head priest offered his greetings. I turned toward the official in charge to express my gratitude, the official responded appropriately, and I withdrew.

1. After that, I requested through Engakuin to meet with the official in charge. Soon the official appeared, so I expressed gratitude for the audience and also offered greetings to the official before withdrawing.
　　Note: The official escorted me to just before the main entrance.

1. Upon returning, I immediately expressed gratitude that he had offered his respects.
　　　　　Same month, 15th day
1. For the delivery of the official document, I wore fukusa awase hemp formal dress and ascended to the castle at the fifth hour. I reported my attendance to the inspector through the Buddhist monks.

1. I consulted with the inspector and observed the seating arrangement for the presentation of items in the Hame-no-ma.

1. I went to my seat when all the elders were assembled.
　　Note: Today there was no monthly courtesy ceremony, so for this special ceremony, all the colleagues attended and went to their seats.

1. The inspector approached and informed me that after the courtesy ceremony, the document presentation would take place, so I should gauge the timing and take my seat.

1. From there, all my colleagues went around to the Take-no-ma at the main entrance, while I remained in my seat. Soon it appeared that the courtesy ceremony participants were finishing and gathering, so I gauged the timing and took my seat in front of the Oshidori sliding doors. Lord Bitchū-no-kami appeared in the Hame-no-ma, the inspector offered guidance, and I passed through the Yamabuki-no-ma and headed toward the Hame-no-ma. Emerging from the right room of that location, I positioned myself about one tatami mat's distance from Lord Bitchū-no-kami in the center, then advanced to receive the official document, and again seated myself about one tatami mat away. To the magistrate official, I inquired through official message: "Should I follow precedent as before?" I was told "Follow precedent as before and be diligent in all matters," received this instruction, and withdrew. Then, since my own caretaker was waiting at the middle entrance, I handed the official document to him and departed. For tomorrow morning's departure, I made farewell visits to the elders as duty required, submitted notification only to the duty officer, and returned home at the ninth hour.

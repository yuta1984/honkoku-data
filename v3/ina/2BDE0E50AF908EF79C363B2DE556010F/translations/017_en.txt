I changed sandal bearers below, had the sword bearer take my sword at the top of the stone steps on the right, then entered the mausoleum. There was a purification basin on the right side, so I performed ablutions, then untied my hakama cords on the right side outside the Karamon Gate. Inside the Karamon Gate on the left and right, the magistrate and other attending physicians prostrated themselves—no greeting was necessary—and I ascended the stairs. At this point music began, I entered inside the front doors, remained facing sideways, briefly performed a middle bow, and took my seat on the tatami below the green bamboo blind on the right side in the center.
　Note: No middle bow was necessary in the presence of the temple head.

1. The Buddhist service began with the temple head's officiating, and after the ceremonial service was completed, the temple head entered directly into the inner sanctuary and offered incense. Soon after, Ryūkō-in came before where I was seated, there was a greeting, and he led the way into the inner sanctuary, at which point music began.
　Note: A folding fan was also carried in.

1. I placed my hands on the kneeling cushion in the inner sanctuary and performed incense offering, using what was in the incense box. I completed the formal worship as imperial representative and withdrew, then sat on the tatami on the right side inside the doors in front of the worship hall. The temple head withdrew from the inner sanctuary, and seeing him emerge to the worship hall, I rose from the tatami, advanced slightly, and stated "The Buddhist service has been completed without incident, which brings great joy." There was a respectful acknowledgment, and I returned to my original seat. After the temple head's descent from the mountain was completed, I descended the stairs under Ryūkō-in's guidance and adjusted my hakama cords.

I proceeded to the inner sanctuary as imperial representative, with the Nikkō magistrate also accompanying me. At the place where thin mats were laid below the stone steps of the inner sanctuary, I lowered my cords, then under Ryūkō-in's guidance ascended the stairs again, entered inside the front doors, came before the treasure pagoda, placed my hands on the kneeling cushion, and performed the worship as imperial representative. There was no incense offering. After this was completed, I adjusted my hakama cords at the original place, and under Ryūkō-in's guidance proceeded to just before the Karamon Gate. At that time Shōson-in brought his offering and handed it to the monk, and I witnessed it being placed in the inner sanctuary before departing. I ascended the stairs and performed formal bowing on the veranda as is done in Edo, and when withdrawing, since the magistrate and others were assembled and waiting below the stairs, I stated that "The Buddhist service has been completed without incident, bringing great joy" and withdrew. I adjusted my hakama outside the Karamon Gate and descended the mountain, then proceeded to temple lodging Shōson-in, bathed for purification, and put on formal court dress.

I proceeded to the main shrine, dismounted at the slope below the stone torii at Niō Gate, and from this point took only caretakers and palanquin attendants, accompanied by Shōson-in. As is done in Edo, I performed ablutions at the purification pavilion. Inside the Karamon Gate I received the ceremonial sword and horse fee from the caretaker's attendant, put the folding fan in my breast, and brought these offerings.

I entered the main shrine, ascended the stairs, and on the veranda witnessed the ceremonial sword and inventory being placed in the inner sanctuary, then performed worship. The shrine attendant brought out the sacred offerings, and I entered within the threshold and remained respectfully waiting.

When the sacred offerings were brought before me, there was guidance to prostrate and receive them. I sat on the left side of the stone area in front of the inner sanctuary with hands placed respectfully, and at that time sacred sake cups were brought out and I received the sacred sake. After finishing, I handed the sake cup to Shōson-in, withdrew to the veranda as initially, exchanged greetings with the magistrate and head priest, and departed. Outside the Karamon Gate,

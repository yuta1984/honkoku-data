First day of the fourth month
One, half past eight (in the morning)

A formal letter jointly signed by the former senior councilors arrived from Abe Bicchu-no-kami, and I submitted an acknowledgment letter following precedent. A copy of the formal letter is as follows:

　　　　Doi Ohi-no-kami
　　　　Aoyama Shimotsuke-no-kami
To Naito Yamato-no-kami　Abe Bicchu-no-kami
　　　　Mizuno Dewa-no-kami
　　　　Okubo Kaga-no-kami

On Mino paper, folded and hung

There is official business, so please come to the castle at the fourth hour (10 AM) tomorrow. That is all.

One, regarding the above matter, I notified my colleagues and other trusted senior inspectors and inspectors according to precedent.

Second day of the fourth month
One, I left home at half past the seventh hour (7:30 AM), wearing formal court dress with hakama, and went to the castle. Since I was summoned for official business, I sent notification to the inspector through a monk. Suda Yozaemon sent word that he understood, and Kuchiki Oki-no-kami and Oka Shuzen also had similar official summons, so they came to the castle shortly. The three of us consulted together and went to the Fuyo room to coordinate our actions for when we would receive instructions.

One, with the senior councilors' arrival at the castle, today's duty officials - Inaba Tsushima-no-kami, Ishikawa Nakatsukasa, myself, and Oki Shuzen - all came out to the same room. Soon Inspector Okusa Shuzen arrived and showed us a written message. We sat behind the four-panel screen in the Kari room, read through the message, and sent word that we understood.

First day of the fourth month
1. Before the eighth hour and half, an official letter jointly signed by the Senior Councilors arrived from Lord Abe Bitchu-no-kami, and I submitted a receipt following precedent. A copy of the official letter is as follows:

Due to official business, you are to

Second day of the fourth month
1. I departed my residence at the fifth hour and half, wearing formal silk jacket and hakama, and proceeded to the castle. Since I was summoned for official business, the Inspector sent notice through a monk attendant, which Tsugita Yozaemon acknowledged and reported back.
Kuchiki Oki-no-kami and Ooka Shuzen also received similar summons for official business and arrived at the castle shortly after, so the three of us conferred and proceeded to the Fuyo Room, where we agreed upon the proper procedures for receiving instructions.

1. Since the Senior Councilors had arrived at the castle, today's attendants - Inaba Tsushima-no-kami, Ishikawa Nakatsukasa, myself, Oki-no-kami, and Shuzen - all appeared in the assembly room. Shortly after, Inspector Okusa Shuzen approached and showed us a written notice. We took our seats behind the four-panel screens in the Kari Room - myself, Oki-no-kami, and Shuzen - read through the notice, and sent word to Tsugita that we had understood its contents.

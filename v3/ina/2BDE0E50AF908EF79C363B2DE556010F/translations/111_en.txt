After the formal greeting (御機嫌伺い) was completed, under the direction of the metsuke (inspectors), two kōke (high-ranking court nobles) took their seats, and the appointment as Nikkō deputy for the 17th day was concluded. Both myself and Matsudaira Iga-no-kami proceeded together from the middle of the Fuyō-no-ma (Lotus Room), and with the rōjū (senior councilors) seated in formation, the duty officer Matsudaira Izu-no-kami announced that I was to be appointed as Nikkō deputy for the coming 20th day as written in the document, and handed me one written directive.

I received it and immediately extracted and read the directive, also showing it to Iga-no-kami. After placing the directive aside, I formally accepted the appointment as Nikkō deputy for the 20th day, expressing that it was an honor and expressing gratitude, and Iga-no-kami also offered his congratulations in turn. Then, carrying the directive, we all proceeded to the Kari-no-ma (Wild Goose Room) and withdrew from the edge. Yagyū Tajima-no-kami, Matsudaira Hyūga-no-kami, and Takagi Mizu-no-shō, three men, took their seats and were appointed as festival magistrates and deputies for Nikkō on the 17th day.

Item: Today I was appointed as Nikkō deputy for the 20th day, so regarding the courtesy calls (御礼回り) by Iga-no-kami and myself, when Matsudaira Suō-no-kami served two years ago, he did not make calls on those in mourning. Last year when Matsudaira Tōtōmi-no-kami was appointed, the courtesy calls followed precedent, and at that time he did not serve Echizen-no-kami due to mourning. However, when leave to go to Nikkō was granted, an official letter arrived that differed from precedent - it lacked the character "kiyome" (purification) and also included Echizen-no-kami's name. So I consulted with the 17th day festival magistrates Makino Naizen-no-shō and Abe Settsu-no-kami, and they said that for both of them, the official letter's content was unchanged from precedent, and currently Echizen-dono's name was absent, probably because he was in mourning. Based on this, I sent a retainer to consult with the clerk of duty officer Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami, and received the response that even those in mourning should serve without concern. Therefore, this time following this guidance, even though wakadoshiyori Ii Hyōbu-dono was in mourning, I made the rounds. I discussed this with Iga-no-kami and he served similarly. I made sure to inform ōmetsuke Kuwabara Yoshū thoroughly about this matter.

The written directive handed over by Izu-no-kami with the rōjū seated in formation was as follows:

Nikkō Deputy for the 20th Day: Tsuchiya Tajima-no-kami

turned right and stood, retreated from the threshold of the lower platform to the first tatami mat, placed his hands on the second tatami mat
and prostrated himself. Lord Bizen-no-kami responded "I humbly accept," and there was an exchange. He slid out to outside the threshold,
turned right and stood, withdrew as before, and at the morning glory cedar doors (marginal note: wearing sword, holding fan) at the clock
room's adjoining area where he had initially been, he came out and immediately passed through the middle room to the hibiscus room
and exchanged greetings with his fellow officials who were present

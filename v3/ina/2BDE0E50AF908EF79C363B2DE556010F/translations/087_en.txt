Diagram of the meeting with Kannon-in

【Floor plan】

- Since sweets bestowed by the head priest had arrived earlier, they were placed in front of the alcove in the guest hall.

- As messengers, the caretaker of Shūgaku-in and Dairaku-in together graciously came out to the entrance to greet and guide us, and we were shown to the study. After Shūgaku-in conveyed the formal message that dinner would be provided tomorrow, Dairaku-in conveyed the formal message that sweets would be bestowed. We advanced to the front of the alcove, received the sweets, and with brief greetings went to the kitchen area where sweets and soup were served. After this was completed, we withdrew. The response given to Shūgaku-in was as follows:
"That you continue in good health is a most precious and grateful matter. That dinner will be provided tomorrow is a most humble honor. Please convey our acceptance of this matter appropriately."

After this was concluded, to Dairaku-in:
"Regarding my arrival here, through your messenger I humbly receive this gift (sweets)."

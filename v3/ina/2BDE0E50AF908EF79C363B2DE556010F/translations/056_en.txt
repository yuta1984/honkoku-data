Twenty-ninth Day
1. Today, for the audience upon returning to the capital, I purified myself (wearing the bestowed crested noshime semi-formal dress) and departed my residence just before 6:30 (a little before 7 AM) to go to the castle. I sent word through a servant that I had arrived at the castle to the metsuke (inspector). Kakehi Sukebei acknowledged this, and while I was waiting in the servant's quarters, the goyōban (duty officer) soon arrived at the castle. I waited in my designated place, and under the guidance of metsuke Itō Chōbei, I took my seat behind the shoji screen at the threshold of the guest seating area in the Yamabuki-no-ma (Mountain Rose Room).

1. When the locked entrance opened, I went out to the Eastern Veranda under Itō Chōbei's guidance. Immediately, under the guidance of wakadoshiyori (junior councilor) Tachibana Izumo-no-kami, I entered through the locked entrance, and at the second turn by the cedar doors, at the corner of the corridor, my wakizashi (short sword) and fan were taken and placed to the left. I entered through the white eagle cedar doors, positioned myself by the inner shoji screens and waited. Izumo-no-kami exchanged greetings with Izu-no-kami-dono, moved toward the shoji screens, sat down at the threshold of the inner side, then slid inside and prostrated myself. When Izu-no-kami-dono announced only my name, there was a response, and I received the lord's words. I advanced before his presence, sat below the upper platform, then slid up to the upper platform, prostrated myself, and made the following report:
"On the twentieth day past, at the Nikko
Mausoleum, I successfully performed the proxy worship
and completed all matters without omission."
After completing this report, I slid down from the upper platform, turned right, and from below, placed my hands on the second tatami mat, prostrated myself, and turned only my face toward the goyōban, receiving acknowledgment. His lordship graciously said this was hard work and much trouble, and again turned toward Izu-no-kami-dono with acknowledgment. After this concluded, I turned right and withdrew, exited as I had entered, passed through the locked entrance and Yamabuki-no-ma, returned to my seat, and immediately went to the servant quarters where the formal visit arrangements were completed, then proceeded to the Western Castle.
However, today a formal visit to Zōjō-ji Temple was announced, so for the audience, my colleagues consulted together and, according to established protocol, went to the Seiko-no-ma (West Lake Room).

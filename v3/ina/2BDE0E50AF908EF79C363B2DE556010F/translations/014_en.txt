[This is gratefully received], and moreover I consulted about assistance during my own worship ceremony as imperial representative and expressed my desire to conduct an inspection today. When he departed, I escorted him to the next room.
　　Note: I also confirmed the departure time for tomorrow morning.

1. Imperial physician Kitamura Yasumasa entered. Same as before, no escort.

1. As messengers from the temple head, Executive Head Ryūō-in and Caretaker Hōmon-in entered. I went out to greet them to the next room and led them to the reception room. I received the verbal message that tomorrow a meal would be provided at the main temple. I went to the kitchen area and served soup, sake, and sweets, and after completing this, departed. That the temple head continues in perfect health is, though I say so humbly, a most precious matter. Since a meal will be provided tomorrow, I consider it a most gracious honor to be able to visit the main temple. I stated that the matter of acceptance should be favorably reported, moved up slightly to a higher seat and personally gave greetings, and moreover consulted about assistance in all matters for this occasion. When they departed, I escorted them to the entrance platform.

1. Magistrate Tsuchiya Chikugo-no-kami entered, so I served soup, sake, sweets and such, and after this was completed, we met face to face. When I inquired about his well-being, I conveyed that he was in good health. I conveyed that there was a message from the elders. At that time, a retainer brought out an official document from the next room, I took it in my own hands and handed it to Chikugo. Then this person informed me that the sacred mountain was secure, and in the same manner we exchanged greetings expressing joy. Moving down slightly in my seat, I stated that having been appointed as imperial representative this time, my inquiry about personal worship at the main shrine and mausoleum had been completed as discussed, for which I was grateful. I announced that I would conduct an inspection of the main shrine and mausoleum later, coordinated the manner of service for tomorrow morning when I would serve as imperial representative, and consulted about assistance in all matters. I escorted him to the next room.
　　Note: Although it is precedent to seal the order document at the main temple after completing service as imperial representative tomorrow, since tomorrow will be pressed for time with little opportunity, I discussed and arranged to seal the document after showing the draft of the consultation.

1. Both Nikko deputy representatives Hori Rihei and Nakagawa Matajirō entered. I took my seat personally, exchanged greetings stating that I had been appointed imperial representative and earnestly requested their favor, then withdrew.

1. As a messenger from the temple head, steward and below, Shindō Tamba-no-kami came to present sweets. Since a box of sweets arrived before the messenger, I spread a felt mat on the alcove of the sitting room and placed it on top. Before long the messenger arrived, so I went out to greet him, guided him, and led him to the reception room to receive his verbal message. I prostrated myself facing toward the box of sweets and withdrew. When I offered soup and sweets, he declined, so I departed immediately. That the temple head continues in perfect peace is, though I say so humbly, a most precious matter. I am grateful that he sent a messenger to inquire about my travel lodgings and presented sweets. I stated that the matter of acceptance should be favorably reported, moved up slightly and personally gave greetings. When he departed, I escorted him to the entrance platform.

1. After the visitors were finished, I bathed to purify myself, donned my ceremonial dress and hakama, and departed before nine-thirty to visit the main temple. I dismounted at the stone slope below the temple gate, then at the main entrance, Executive Head Ryūō-in, Caretaker Hōmon, stewards and others came out to greet me at the platform and provided guidance. I exchanged brief courtesies and proceeded to the reception room carrying my sword.

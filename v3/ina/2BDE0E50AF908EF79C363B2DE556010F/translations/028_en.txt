3rd day

1. Left the residence a little past 5:30 (around 9 AM), wearing silk summer formal attire (kamishimo), and attended the castle.

1. Regarding appearing due to an official summons, [I] sent word through a monk to the metsuke, whereupon Daijūkurōbei acknowledged the message. Those who appeared today for the official summons were Lord Matsudaira Kii-no-kami, Lord Nagai Shinano-no-kami (represented by Lord Honjō Ōmi-no-kami due to illness), Niwa Shikibu-shōyū, and Lord Yonekura Tango-no-kami, all of whom received instructions together. Seating arrangements were discussed and decided. Lord Kii-no-kami received separate instructions. Understanding the collective matters, procedures for conduct and expressing gratitude were also coordinated. Among the Kōke families, Lord Toda Bingo-no-kami and Nakajō Kawachi-no-kami were also summoned, so today's procedures were discussed. After the rōjū (senior councilors) assembled, along with the tsumejū (duty officers) Lord Sakai Shuri and Lord Doi Noto, [we] all took our seats.

1. After assembling, Metsuke Yamaki Wakasa-no-kami came to the Kari-no-ma and showed the attendance list, which I read. Since the names of myself and Lord Kii-no-kami appeared after the two Kōke members, I acknowledged this with proper greetings. Soon the rōjū made their rounds of the reception rooms, so [we] waited behind the Fuyō veranda and near the Kari sliding doors, with myself positioned after the two Kōke members. Lord Matsudaira Kii-no-kami, being assigned to the Teikan-no-ma, waited at the Ken-no-ma veranda. After the rōjū completed their rounds and the tsumejū finished their courtesy calls, following instructions from the metsuke, the two Kōke members took their places and were appointed as Nikkō representatives for the 17th, completing that business. Both myself and Lord Matsudaira Kii-no-kami took our places together from the central pillar of the Fuyō-no-ma, and with the rōjū in session, Goyōban Matsudaira Izu-no-kami made the announcement: "Regarding the Nikkō representation on the coming 20th day, [you] are appointed as written in the document," and handed over one official document, which I received. I immediately opened and read the document, then passed it to Lord Kii. After he examined it, both myself and Lord Kii-no-kami expressed our gratitude for this honor. Lord Kii-no-kami immediately folded the document, placed it in his breast, and withdrew.
　　Note: The above document was returned to me, so I handed it to my deputy in the middle room.

1. After this was completed, three people took their places: Lord Honjō Ōmi-no-kami (representing Lord Nagai Shinano-no-kami), Niwa Shikibu-shōyū, and Lord Yonekura Tango-no-kami, and were appointed as festival supervisors and substitutes for Nikkō on the 17th.

1. One official document handed over by Lord Izu-no-kami while the rōjū were in session reads as follows:

First, after Lord Harima and Izu departed together, I went to see Lord Kii, the duty officer, reported tomorrow's departure notice at the entrance, made farewell remarks upon returning, and also visited other off-duty senior officials to bid farewell, bringing written statements and presenting them at their entrances.
I returned home after eight o'clock.

　　The report to the duty officer was as follows:

　　　I will depart for Nikkō tomorrow, the 4th day. I hereby 
　　　present myself to report this matter.
　　　　　October 3rd

　　The farewell statement upon return and to the off-duty senior officials was as follows:

　　　I will depart for Nikkō tomorrow, the 4th day. I hereby
　　　present myself to bid farewell.
　　　　　October 3rd

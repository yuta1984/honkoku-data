October 1st, same as before, as follows:
　　【The following two lines have brackets at the beginning】
　　　No need to attend castle. If there are matters of service,
　　　should proceed to the monthly duty elder councilor
　　　　　However, regarding service inquiry attached notes, precedent stated no need to attend castle, but this time
　　　　　the attached note differs, so inquiry was made through the caretaker to the official clerk who issued the note,
　　　　　but there was no definitive answer, so inquiry was also made
　　　　　confidentially to external official clerks, who said that it was probably not
　　　　　included in the inquiry document's attached note, so this will not
　　　　　serve as precedent for the future, noted for reference

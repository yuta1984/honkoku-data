I partook, and when the temple head offered side dishes, I approached his side still wearing my sword, received them, and withdrew to my original place. When I requested to pour sake in return, he instructed me to return the cup, so I declined through the temple administrator, but when he insisted again, I poured sake into the earthenware cup and handed it to the attendant. The attendant placed the cup on the stand and presented it to the temple head.

Seeing him take it in his hands, I waited for the appropriate moment, and after the attendant withdrew the cup, the temple head retired to his private quarters. Returning to the meal as before, the second soup course was replaced with sweet red bean soup, and after finishing with hot water, sweets were served twice in the latter part, and after tea was completed, I withdrew to my original seat. Soon the temple head appeared again, so under the caretaker's guidance, as with yesterday's audience, I sat at the threshold edge, then proceeded as before, turned toward the temple administrator and stated that I was deeply grateful for receiving the meal. There was acknowledgment and the temple head offered his greetings. At this point I displayed the ceremonial sword I had brought as a horse substitute in the upper room within the threshold, there were greetings regarding proper etiquette, and after prostrating myself, I addressed the temple administrator saying he should retire to his quarters. At that time there were greetings conveying messages from the senior retainers, and the temple administrator acknowledged them.

After the temple head retired, I immediately withdrew, inserted my fan, brought my sword and proceeded to the waiting room. The sword was placed beside the entrance-side alcove platform as before, and I sat in the initial position. When the temple administrator and caretakers came, I stated that I was deeply grateful for their continued kindness, and after finishing, I expressed gratitude to various people for their assistance. They also conveyed thanks for gifts sent, so I offered appropriate greetings and immediately departed under the guidance of both officials. In the corridor, I was seen off by the magistrate, attending physician and others, and expressed thanks for all their assistance. At the place where I had initially tied up my hakama, I tied up my long hakama, and temple officials, administrators and caretakers came to see me off as they had come to greet me at the platform. I briefly remained below, offered greetings and departed. I proceeded to outside the temple gate and returned, and on the bamboo matting of the main entrance, still wearing my sword, I addressed the attendant.

As follows:
　Today you graciously served a meal and even offered sake cups, for which I am deeply grateful. As I will soon depart from this area, I have come to express my thanks. Please convey this message properly to the temple administrators.

After this was completed, I went to the residence of Tsuchiya Chikugo-no-kami's deputy and handed the attendant a written statement as follows:
　This time I have performed my duties as imperial representative without incident. I am grateful for the various considerations shown to me. As I will soon depart from this area, I have come to convey this message.

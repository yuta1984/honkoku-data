One, I left home at half past the seventh hour (7:30 AM), wearing formal court dress with hakama, and went to the castle. Since I was summoned for official business, I sent notification to the inspector through a monk. Suda Yozaemon sent word that he understood, and Kuchiki Oki-no-kami and Oka Shuzen also had similar official summons, so they came to the castle shortly. The three of us consulted together and went to the Fuyo room to coordinate our actions for when we would receive instructions.

One, with the senior councilors' arrival at the castle, today's duty officials - Inaba Tsushima-no-kami, Ishikawa Nakatsukasa, myself, and Oki Shuzen - all came out to the same room. Soon Inspector Okusa Shuzen arrived and showed us a written message. We sat behind the four-panel screen in the Kari room, read through the message, and sent word that we understood.

Written Message: Fuyo Room
　　　　　　　　Naito Yamato-no-kami
　　　　　　　　Kuchiki Oki-no-kami
The above persons should all come forth.

One, during the inspection rounds, behind the four-panel screen in the Kari room, following the high-ranking retainers Yokose Suruga-dono and Maeda Shinano-dono who were summoned for official business, myself and Oki Shuzen took our seats.
Note: fans were placed behind in the same location.

One, the duty officials inquired about His Lordship's mood, and when this was completed, the senior councilors took their seats in rows in the Fuyo room. The senior inspector, through formal greeting, had both high-ranking retainers Yokose Suruga-dono and Maeda Shinano-dono step back together. After the formal announcement was completed, through the senior inspector's greeting, myself and Oki came forth together and sat as shown in the diagram. The duty councilor Abe Bicchu-no-kami made the announcement: "For the twentieth day Nikko proxy service, Oki-no-kami is appointed as substitute for Yamato-no-kami," and handed over an official document. Therefore, I came forth to receive it, sat in my original seat to examine it, then passed it directly to Oki-no-kami who examined it, then returned it directly to me. I folded it and placed it beside me, expressed gratitude saying "what an honorable appointment," held the official document in hand, and withdrew. The official document handed over by Bicchu-no-kami read as follows:

　　Nikko Twentieth Day
Half-size paper　Proxy　　Naito Yamato-no-kami
　　　　　　　　Substitute　Kuchiki Oki-no-kami
The above appointment is hereby made.

One, I handed the above official document to the caretaker at the middle entrance, and he took it away first.

One, Near the veranda of the Kiku room, Yokose Suruga-dono and Maeda Shinano-dono were present, so I offered my greetings. They also greeted me, saying "the proxy appointment was made on the seventeenth day," and furthermore requested "regarding the practice of etiquette for the farewell ceremony in the formal audience room - it's not urgent but please certainly help with this," which I readily accepted.

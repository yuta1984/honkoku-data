The attendants escorted me to the entrance area with thin mats, so I also exchanged greetings there.
At the same place, I put on my sword, returned from the middle of the ceremonial courtyard, and lightly presented the following formal statement with one hand to the entrance area with thin mats:
　　"Today, having been graciously provided with a meal and receiving your thoughtful consideration, I am truly
　　 grateful beyond measure. As I will be departing from this place shortly,
　　 I have come to express my gratitude."

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　This matter [to be reported] to the executive staff
　　However, according to precedent, the meal should have been provided at the main temple building, but due to slight indisposition
　　and the short duration of the visit, various matters took time and the departure was delayed, causing difficulties.
　　Therefore, the caretaker had previously consulted privately with Homon-in, but the discussion seemed
　　complicated. After further private consultation, an arrangement was made for receiving [the meal],
　　and the matter was concluded as written in the main text.

One: From there I went to Hori Mino-no-kami, and when the attendant came out to the middle of the white sand courtyard, I presented the following
　formal statement:
　　　"Regarding my recent service
　　　 as deputy representative, I have completed my duties without incident, which brings great joy. As I will shortly
　　　 depart from here, I have come to pay my respects."

We were escorted, so we exchanged greetings in the same manner there as well. Outside the cedar doors at the same location, wearing formal court dress, we were escorted to the entrance platform of Hōmon-in, so we performed appropriate greetings. In addition,

The attendants escorted us to the thin mat area, so we also greeted them. At the same location, wearing our swords, we returned from the middle of the white sand courtyard and lightly presented the following oral statement with one hand to the thin mat area:

"Today we have been graciously provided with a meal and shown great consideration, which is truly humbling. As I will soon depart from this place, I have come to express my gratitude.

This matter should be conveyed to the executive staff."

However, according to previous custom, meals were provided at the main temple quarters, but due to slight indisposition and a short stay, various delays occurred and departure was postponed, causing difficulties. Therefore, our caretaker had previously consulted with Hōmon-in, but the discussion seemed difficult, so further consultation was conducted and an arrangement was made to receive the meal in the form described, completing the matter as written in the main text.

1. Then we went to Hori Mino-no-kami, and an attendant came out to the middle of the white sand courtyard, so we presented the following oral statement:
"On this occasion, I have successfully completed my duties as deputy without incident, which brings great joy. As I will soon depart from here, I have come to pay my respects."

1. Then we returned directly to our lodgings, withdrawing after half past five o'clock.

1. After completing the deputy duties, gifts and messengers were sent from various places.

1. Around nine o'clock, we departed from our lodgings. {{Marginal note: After departure, messengers were sent to Mino-no-kami and the deputies to inform them of our withdrawal}}

1. From today onward, there were many courtesies to be paid to accompanying messengers and attendants along the route.

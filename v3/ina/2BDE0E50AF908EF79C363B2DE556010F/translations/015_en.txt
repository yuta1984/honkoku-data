Since there was a decline, I departed immediately. That the temple head continues in perfect peace is, though I say so humbly, a most precious matter. I am grateful that he sent a messenger to inquire about my travel lodgings and presented sweets. I stated that the matter of acceptance should be favorably reported, moved up slightly and personally gave greetings. When departing, I was escorted to the entrance platform.

1. After the visitors were finished, I bathed to purify myself, donned my ceremonial dress and hakama, and departed before nine-thirty to visit the main temple. I dismounted at the stone slope below the temple gate, then at the main entrance, Executive Head Ryūō-in, Caretaker Hōmon-in, stewards and others came out to greet me at the platform and provided guidance. I exchanged brief courtesies and proceeded to the reception room carrying my sword. I placed my sword outside the reception room, and when the executive head and caretaker appeared, I stated my message as follows:

　　At Edo,
　　I stated that the Shogun and the Right General continue in excellent health, and that there was a message from the elders. I was appointed as imperial representative on the twentieth day of this month, and my inquiry about personal worship at the main shrine and mausoleum has been completed as discussed, for which I am grateful. Moreover, having just arrived, I received sweets through your messenger, and furthermore I have been graciously informed that a meal will be provided tomorrow, which I consider a most gracious honor. I requested to inspect the reception room for tomorrow's audience while there was time, and accompanied by both men, Shōson-in also came to inspect the reception room. We learned the procedure for the audience and returned to the original reception room.
　　Note: Regarding Shōson-in, immediately under his guidance I placed my sword at the inner side, also placed my fan in the same location, and proceeded to the reception room. The temple head appeared, the caretaker withdrew with courtesies, I took a middle position at the threshold edge, and after the temple head's courtesies, I entered within the threshold of the upper room.

I reported that the Shogun and Right General continue in excellent health, and stated that the temple head's continued perfect peace is, though I say so humbly, a most precious matter. The temple head, remaining in the same place with his cloth sash and sword, approached his side to receive [the message] and withdrew to his original seat.

Addressing the executive head, I stated that I had received sweets through a messenger earlier, and furthermore had been graciously informed that a meal would be provided tomorrow, and moreover that having come to pay my respects, I was granted an audience, which I consider a most gracious honor, then withdrew. I passed through the waiting room, exchanged greetings with the executive head and caretaker, and departed. There was an escort as at the arrival, and I removed my sword in the lower reception room before departing.

1. From there I proceeded to the main shrine. I dismounted at the stone slope below the Niō Gate, and from this point inward I was accompanied only by stewards, caretakers, palanquin attendants, and sandal bearers. Near the Nitenmon Gate, Shōson-in and the deputy abbot were waiting to greet me and provided guidance. At the left side of the bronze work inside the Niō Gate, I performed ablutions, and at the bottom of the Yōmeimon Gate's wooden steps, the sandal bearers were replaced. From this point inward, I proceeded accompanied by stewards, caretakers, and both sword attendants. At the gate outside this location, I handed over my sword to be carried by the sword attendant, and Shōson-in managed all these and other matters. Regarding tomorrow's ceremony procedures, monks who were assistants from Dairakuin and shrine attendants were present, and I consulted with them in advance. Then I viewed the interior of the main shrine and withdrew as before. I proceeded to inspect the interior of the mausoleum

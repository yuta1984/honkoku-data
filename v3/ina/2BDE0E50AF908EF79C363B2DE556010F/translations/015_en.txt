When he declined, I departed immediately. That the temple head continues in perfect peace is, though I say so humbly, a most precious matter. I am grateful that he sent a messenger to inquire about my travel lodgings and presented sweets. I stated that the matter of acceptance should be favorably reported, moved up slightly and personally gave greetings. When departing, I was escorted to the entrance platform.

1. After the visitors were finished, I bathed to purify myself, donned ceremonial dress and hakama, and departed before nine-thirty to visit the main temple. I dismounted at the stone slope below the temple gate, then at the main entrance, Executive Head Ryūō-in, Caretaker Hōmon-in, stewards and others came out to greet me at the platform with guidance. I exchanged brief courtesies and proceeded to the reception room carrying my sword, placing the sword outside the sitting room. When the executive head and caretaker appeared, I stated my message as follows:

　　　At Edo:
　　　The Shogun and Right General continue in excellent health, and I conveyed that there was a message from the council of elders. I stated that I had been appointed imperial representative on the 20th of this month, and that my personal worship at the main shrine and mausoleum had been completed as inquired, for which I am grateful. Moreover, having just arrived, I received one item through a messenger, and furthermore I humbly received word that a meal would be provided tomorrow, which I consider a most gracious honor. I requested to inspect the reception room where the audience would take place while there was time, and accompanied by both persons, Shōson-in also came to inspect the reception room, received instructions on the procedure for the audience, and returned to the original reception room.
　　　Note: Regarding Shōson-in, he directly guided me to the inner chamber.

I placed my sword there, took my fan to the same place, and went to the reception room. The temple head appeared, and I withdrew with the caretaker's courtesy, took a middle seat at the threshold, and after the temple head's courtesy, entered within the threshold of the upper room.

I reported that the Shogun and Right General continue in excellent health, and stated that the temple head's continued perfect peace is, though I say so humbly, a most precious matter. The temple head, remaining in the same place with his ceremonial sash and wearing his sword, approached his side, received [the message] and withdrew to his original seat.

Facing the executive head, I stated that I had earlier received one item through a messenger and furthermore received word that a meal would be provided tomorrow, and that having come to visit, I considered it a most gracious honor to be granted an audience, then withdrew. I passed through the waiting room, exchanged greetings with the executive head and caretaker, and returned home. There was an escort as when I arrived, and I put on my sword in the lower reception room before departing.

1. From there I proceeded to the main shrine. I dismounted at the stone slope outside the Niō Gate, and from this point forward took only stewards, caretakers, palanquin attendants, and sandal bearers. Near the Nitenmon Gate, Shōson-in and the deputy abbot were waiting to greet me and provided guidance. I performed ablutions at the bronze vessels to the left inside the Niō Gate, and changed sandal bearers at the bottom of the wooden steps of Yōmeimon Gate. From this point forward I took stewards, caretakers, and both sword bearers. At the gate outside this location, I removed my sword and had the sword bearer carry it, with Shōson-in managing all other arrangements. Regarding tomorrow's procedures for my personal ceremony, monks who were deputies of Dairakuin and shrine attendants were present and I confirmed arrangements with them. From there I viewed the interior of the main shrine and withdrew as before. I proceeded to inspect the interior of the mausoleum.

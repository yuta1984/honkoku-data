1. The accompanying physician Tanaka Shunkawa came and was served sweets and soup. When he inquired after my well-being, I responded that I was in good health, and when he departed I escorted him to the next room.

1. As messengers from the gate master, the accompanying executive Engaku-in and the caretaker Jōdo-in came together. I went out to greet them at the next room, guided them to the study, and received word that tomorrow a meal would be provided at the main temple. I went to the kitchen area where sweets and soup were served, and they departed.
　　　　"The gate master is increasingly in good health, and though I am presumptuous, I consider this a precious matter. Tomorrow when the meal is provided, I shall visit the main temple, which I consider most fortunate. Please make proper arrangements for acceptance of this invitation."
　After stating the above, I moved up slightly in seating to give my own greetings, requested assistance at the main temple, and when they departed I escorted them to the ceremonial entrance.

1. Magistrate Ōkubo Naizen-no-shō came and was served sweets and soup before departing. During our conversation he inquired after my well-being, so I conveyed that I was in good health. There was a message from the elders in Edo:
　"Please convey that the Shōgun and Dainagon are increasingly in good spirits," I was told to relay. I delivered an official letter, and from their side as well
　I was informed "that the sacred mountain is safe and secure." I responded with equal gratitude and finished my greetings. Then moving down slightly in seating, I said, "This time on the 20th I was appointed as deputy, for which I am most grateful.
　Also, my personal worship at the shrine and mausoleum was completed as planned, for which I am also grateful." After this, I discussed "the matter of inspecting the interiors of the shrine and mausoleum" and stated,
　"Please teach me the proper procedures for tomorrow morning's duties and provide guidance in all matters."
　I mentioned "Today I would like to visit and observe the main shrine and other locations," and when departing I escorted him to the next room.
　　　　However, tomorrow's notification letter regarding completion of the deputy duties will be handled at the main temple.

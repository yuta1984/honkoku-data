1. This morning before six o'clock I left home and visited Izu-no-kami, who was on duty, for courtesy calls. I completed expressing gratitude for receiving permission to travel to Nikkō in the audience chamber, then proceeded to the inner quarters to inquire about his health and expressed my gratitude again.

1. I also visited three other places - Mizuno Dewa-no-kami and other senior councilors who were off duty - before going to the castle, meeting with their chamberlains to express my gratitude.

1. The head priest of Nikkō departed for Nikkō yesterday. Since I declined the audience the day before yesterday to announce my appointment as representative, I visited the main temple bringing a written statement and left it with the receptionist.
　　　　　I respectfully trust that the head priest continues in good health, which I consider a precious matter. On this occasion, I have been appointed as representative for the twentieth day at Nikkō, which I consider a most grateful fortune. Regarding this appointment, when I requested an audience, you graciously agreed to meet me the day before yesterday, for which I was most grateful. However, I was ill at that time and could not attend. I have come to express my gratitude for that as well. I humbly request that this message be conveyed to the chief administrator.

1. There was no monthly ceremony of gratitude, but many nobles were present, with many extraordinary ceremonies of gratitude. All the others of the same rank left when the locked gate opened, but I alone remained waiting in my seat. Shortly after the ceremony of gratitude ended, Inspector Kojima Magonoemon told me to approach, so I waited by the sliding doors opposite the mandarin duck cedar doors at the entrance to the Yamabuki room. The duty officer Izu-no-kami appeared in the Masuhame room, and I appeared at the inspector's instruction. Regarding the delivery and receipt of the official letter to the Nikkō magistrate, the content of the message to the magistrate's administrator was according to precedent

1. This morning before six o'clock I left home and visited Izu-no-kami, who was on duty, for courtesy calls. I completed expressing gratitude for receiving permission to travel to Nikkō in the audience chamber, then proceeded to the inner quarters to inquire about his health and expressed my gratitude again.

1. I also visited three other places - Mizuno Dewa-no-kami and other senior councilors who were off duty - before going to the castle, meeting with their chamberlains to express my gratitude.

1. The head priest of Nikkō completed his departure for Nikkō yesterday. Since I declined the audience the day before yesterday regarding the announcement of my appointment as representative, I also visited the main temple, bringing a written statement and conveying it through an intermediary.

　　　　　I humbly consider it a matter for celebration that the head priest continues to enjoy good health. On this occasion, I have been appointed as representative for the twentieth day ceremonies at Nikkō, which I regard as a most fortunate honor. Regarding this matter, when I requested an audience, I was graciously told that you would receive me the day before yesterday, for which I am deeply grateful. However, as I was ill at that time and could not attend, I now come to pay my respects and express my gratitude. I humbly request that this matter be properly conveyed to the chief administrator.

　　　14th day
1. Nothing of note occurred.

　　　15th day
1. I left home at three quarters past five o'clock to go to the castle to receive the official letter. (Attire: silk-lined robe, hemp formal dress)

1. I had a servant inform the inspector that I had come to receive the official letter, whereupon the inspector on duty, Kojima Magouemon, sent word that he understood.

1. There was no monthly ceremony, but there were many who had received leave, and many irregular ceremonies. All the other attendees went around after the main gate opened, but I alone remained waiting in my seat. Shortly after the ceremonies concluded, I was told that Inspector Kojima Magouemon wished to see me, so I waited by the sliding doors opposite the mandarin duck cedar doors at the entrance to the Yamabuki chamber. The duty officer Izu-no-kami took his seat in the wainscoted chamber, and following the inspector's instructions, I went forward and received the official letter to be delivered to the Nikkō magistrate. The content of the message to be conveyed to the magistrate's chief administrator was according to previous precedent.

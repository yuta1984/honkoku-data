Kansei 3, Year of the Metal Boar (1791)
October 7th

1. This morning, before the hour of the Horse (around 6 AM), I left home wearing ura-tsuki kataginu (formal court dress with lining) and horse-riding hakama (this time, as agreed upon by all, we wore white tabi socks), proceeded to the castle, and assembled in the Kiku-no-ma (Chrysanthemum Room).
   Note: The riding horses and replacement horses were sent to Yarai Gate at half past the hour of the Monkey this dawn (around 3:30 AM), accompanied by horse attendants.

1. Upon receiving guidance from Ishikawa Rokuuemon, we exited through Naka-no-kuchi, passed through Terasawa Gate and Hasuike Street, and waited within the curtained area in front of Fukiage Garden.

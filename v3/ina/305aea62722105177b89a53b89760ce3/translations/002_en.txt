Regarding this money, 1 ryo 1 bu:
Tozaemon's statement: Although the cypress was sold to a substitute cultivator, the money was not received, and craftsmen's fees and other items were being deducted.
Village officials' statement: The money was received from Daisuke, and craftsmen's fees and other items were recorded in the accounting ledger, so it became Yae-dono's responsibility.
Upon investigation, when the village officials attached tags to the accounting ledger, since this was excluded this time, it became a deduction for the substitute cultivator, and it does not appear to be Tozaemon's loss.

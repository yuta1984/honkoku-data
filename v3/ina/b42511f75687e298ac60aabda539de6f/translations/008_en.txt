Written Pledge Respectfully Submitted

Regarding gambling and betting on various games of chance that have long been prohibited by official decree, it goes without saying that we shall strictly observe all prohibited matters. Among us there have been those who acted contrary to regulations, resulting in official seizures, for which we are deeply ashamed. Hereafter, within our five-household groups, we shall mutually make strict agreements and certainly observe the prohibited matters. Should there be anyone who acts contrary to regulations, the neighboring households in the group shall earnestly admonish them to reform their ways. If even after such efforts they do not comply, and should any improper matter concerning even one person from our group come to official attention, regardless of what judgment we may receive, we shall offer no excuses whatsoever. Therefore, we all jointly affix our seals and respectfully submit this pledge, which is without error. The above.

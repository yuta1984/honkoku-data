A written pledge submitted

Item 1: Regarding the stonemasons of our village, we have investigated throughout the village and compiled a list, and there is not one other person besides these.

Item 2: When going out to work as stonemasons in other places, they shall not take on stonemason apprentices while traveling. Furthermore, we have instructed them in detail to carefully observe the actual conditions at their travel destinations, and they have acknowledged each point. If there should be any negligent matters beyond this point, and you should hear of them later, please report immediately from your end. Moreover, whatever punishment may be imposed upon us, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. This joint-signature document is for future reference. Therefore, as stated above.

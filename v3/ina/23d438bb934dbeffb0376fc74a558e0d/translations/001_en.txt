Document of Submission

Regarding the matter of the autumn re-inspection of religious sects: As there are many official duties at this time, we have been ordered to conduct the population census ourselves this year, which we humbly accept. Under the supervision of town representatives and group leaders, we have conducted the inspection and found that the religious affiliations and population records are exactly as they were during the spring inspection, with no discrepancies whatsoever.

Regarding increases and decreases in population: These are recorded on a separate sheet, and we submit the ledger accordingly.

Having carefully inspected the entire town as described above, we found nothing suspicious. Should anything improper come to your attention, we are prepared to accept whatever punishment you deem appropriate. We submit this jointly signed certificate for future reference.

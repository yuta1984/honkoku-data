Regarding the pledge document we respectfully submit:

1. Concerning the autumn re-examination of religious affiliations, we understand that you have increasingly many official duties. However, we have humbly received your order to conduct the population census ourselves this year. Under the supervision of the town elders, town representative, and group leaders, we have conducted the examination and found that the religious affiliations and population records are exactly the same as in the spring examination, with no discrepancies whatsoever.

1. Regarding increases and decreases in population, we submit the ledger on separate paper.

We have carefully examined the entire town as stated above and found no suspicious matters whatsoever. Should you hear of any issues, please consider them entirely our fault and impose whatever punishment you deem appropriate. We submit this jointly sealed certificate for future reference. Therefore, respectfully submitted as above.

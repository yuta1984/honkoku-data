Document of Submission

Regarding the matter of the autumn re-inspection of religious sects: As you are increasingly busy with various matters at this time, we have been ordered to conduct the population census ourselves this year, which we humbly accept. Under the supervision of the town elders, town representatives, and group leaders, we have conducted the inspection and found that the religious affiliations and population records are exactly as they were during the spring inspection, with no discrepancies whatsoever.

Regarding increases and decreases in population: We submit a separate ledger for these matters.

Having carefully inspected the entire town as described above, we found nothing suspicious. Should anything improper come to your attention, we are prepared to accept whatever punishment you deem appropriate. For future reference, therefore as stated.

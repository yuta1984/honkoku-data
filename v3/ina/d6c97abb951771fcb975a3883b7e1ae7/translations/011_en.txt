Memorandum of Oral Statement

Regarding the matter of our castle town: Since travelers passing through are rare, we make our living solely by handling business within the domain. In recent years, we have gradually declined, and particularly during the previous Year of the Horse, the entire area suffered from a devastating fire. At this time, we have managed to construct some decent buildings along the main street, but due to continued crop failures and other difficulties, our internal finances have become extremely strained, and all our purchasing of goods has become underfunded. Consequently, our annual profits have decreased year by year in accordance with this situation, making it impossible to maintain financial flexibility. Therefore, we have all consulted together and devised various measures to somehow bring prosperity to the castle town, but since we fundamentally cannot secure financing, our efforts have been insufficient. The situation has become vastly different from the town quarters of old, and we all find this lamentable.

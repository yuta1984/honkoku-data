Regarding sake brewing houses: In former years, there were fourteen or fifteen establishments in the town quarters, possessing sake brewing licenses totaling over 800 koku. Because they produced sake and specialized in shipping it to Kōshū, Bushū, and other neighboring provinces, the proceeds from these sales flowed into the town, providing financial liquidity for everyone. However, as the town quarters gradually declined, most of these sake brewing licenses were transferred to rural areas, and at that time only two or three establishments were conducting decent sake brewing operations. This situation is truly lamentable.

In former years, there were also moderately wealthy townspeople in the town quarters who procured large quantities of goods from the three major cities or various provinces and wholesaled them to country towns. In particular, cotton textiles and similar goods were imported in large quantities from the Kamigata region and distributed even to small shops throughout the town. Since payment for these goods was collected over about two seasons, this provided financial liquidity for everyone. However, nowadays we procure small quantities of used cotton textiles for cash from Kōshū Suwa and other places like Iida and Matsumoto.

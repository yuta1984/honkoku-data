One: When receiving the gift of hawks and geese, an official letter arrives the evening before stating what time to ascend to the castle. Sometimes on courtesy visit days, one is told to remain behind. In the Goose Chamber, the Senior Councilors sit in formation, and all colleagues appear together. The Senior Councilor announces that hawks and geese are being bestowed. The birds are carried by the inner palace guards, and colleagues come forward one by one to receive them by touching the feet of the geese. After this is completed, all appear together again to express gratitude and withdraw. Courtesy rounds are made only to the Senior Councilors; rounds to the Junior Councilors are not necessary. This was agreed upon on the 5th day of the 12th month of Kyōhō 18, year of the Ox. However, these courtesy round procedures may differ depending on the occasion as agreed upon at the time.

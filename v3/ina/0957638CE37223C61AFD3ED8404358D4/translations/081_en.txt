Eighth Day
1. From today, except for formal ceremonies, one wears fukusa kosode with lining and formal dress (kamishimo). This should be arranged among the members of the same rank group.
   However, currently, the senior inspectors (ōmetsuke) have informed us the day before regarding informal dress.

Eleventh Day
1. Wearing ceremonial half-formal dress (noshi-me han-kamishimo), one goes to the castle before 5 o'clock.
   When His Lordship appears and takes his seat, starting with those assigned to the Waiting Room (tamari-zume), the hereditary retainers (go-fudai) appear nine at a time in groups.
   After the audience is completed, the high-ranking families (kōke), our colleagues of the same rank, and all the ceremonial announcers (sōsha-ban) line up in the Paneled Chamber (hame-no-ma).
   After the audience is completed, His Lordship immediately proceeds to the Linked Verse Chamber (go-renga-no-ma).
1. After His Lordship's withdrawal, the high-ranking families and colleagues of the same rank line up from the Yamabuki Chamber to the Kari-no-ma (Wild Goose Chamber) and receive the ceremonial armor rice cakes and sake. During this time, the senior councilors give their greetings. When the rice cakes are bestowed and the triple sake offering is presented with noshi (ceremonial gift decoration), one takes it, wraps it in tissue paper, and puts it in one's sleeve. After all officials receive their portions, the senior councilors take their seats in the Hibiscus Chamber (fuyō-no-ma) alongside the senior inspectors and town magistrates as usual. After all hereditary retainers offer their congratulations, our colleagues of the same rank offer congratulations and immediately withdraw.

Fifteenth Day
1. Wearing ceremonial half-formal dress, one goes to the castle at 5 o'clock. The usual audience seat is at the northern veranda of the Seiko Chamber.
   After the audience is completed, one remains along the veranda passage of the Kari-no-ma and withdraws after His Lordship's retirement.

Yesterday there was a ceremonial gathering, and while it may indeed have been due to illness, because the number of duty attendants is small, it would be unseemly in the lord's eyes. If it is only a minor matter, one should force oneself to attend as is proper. Even on duty days, while two or three people are supposed to attend each, recently even one person at a time is only occasionally seen. Such situations should not occur. This too should be coordinated so that two people at a time attend as is proper. The above directive should be communicated.

One: In addition to the new moon and full moon ceremonies, months with ceremonies on the 28th day:
　　1st month, 4th month, 7th month, 12th month
　　Months without ceremonies on the 28th day:
　　2nd month, 3rd month, 5th month, 6th month, 8th month,
　　9th month, 10th month, 11th month
The above should be understood and followed henceforth.

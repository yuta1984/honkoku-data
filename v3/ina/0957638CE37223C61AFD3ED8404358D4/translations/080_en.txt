Sixth Day
1. Wearing formal crested garments (daimon), one goes to the castle at 5:30 and appears at the usual seat.
   Observing the situation, the monthly courtesy ceremony seat during His Lordship's appearance is at the northern veranda of the Seiko Chamber.
   For the audience, only those on duty on the sixth day sit along the veranda passage of the Great Hall, and temple and shrine officials also complete their audience. They remain until His Lordship withdraws, while others among the same rank withdraw immediately after completing their first audience.
   However, those who go to the Great Hall are not limited to those on duty days; by arrangement, about five or six people proceed there. Those who do not go around withdraw immediately.

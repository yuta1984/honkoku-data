One: On the occasion of the first snowfall, inquire after his lordship's well-being in plain clothes and ascend to the
     castle, also attending duties at the Western Citadel.
     However, if even a little snow accumulates, consult with the attendant officials and ascend to
     the castle together.
     However, if it is a formal salutation day and
     one has an audience, a separate inquiry after his lordship's well-being is unnecessary, as was
     agreed among colleagues on the 1st day of the 12th month of Kyōhō 10.
One: For the inquiry after his lordship's well-being at the beginning of the cold season, ascend to the
     castle in plain clothes. The manner of inquiry follows that of the beginning of the doyō period.

1. Regarding matters concerning bandits and thieves, if there are those who carelessly spread unsubstantiated rumors, investigate and issue strict warnings to them.

The above instructions shall be communicated to all retainers of ten thousand koku and below.
　The above is said to be an order from Lord Ando Tsushima-no-kami
　　Messenger officials (tsukaiban)
　　Foot soldier commanders (okashira)
　　Commanders of ten (kojūnin-gashira) [with attachment]

　As we have heard that there are bandits and thieves, regarding the riverside areas, members of the naval guard units (ofunade-gumi) shall patrol, and when suspicious persons are captured, they shall be handed over to the checkpoint stations (tsuji-bansho). From those units they shall be transferred to the town magistrates (machi-bugyō) and the fire and theft investigation officials (hi-kata tōzoku-aratame). However, the number of people accompanying them should be kept to as few as possible.

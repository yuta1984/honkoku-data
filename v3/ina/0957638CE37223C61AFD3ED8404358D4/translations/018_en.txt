Inspectors (Metsuke):
　　Lord Hiraga Shikibu-shōyū
　　Lord Nakagawa Kansaburō
These individuals were appointed to handle the duties related to the submission of preliminary group records for lords with domains under 10,000 koku but above the rank of formal audience with the shogun.

From Lord Asano Sado-no-kami's group:
　　Fukumura Seizaburō
On the 15th day, this individual went mad within the castle grounds and submitted petitions for monetary loans to the Grand Chamberlain's quarters. He remained armed with his sword throughout the incident. Due to his complete mental derangement, the Inspectors immediately took charge of the matter and transferred him to Lord Ikeda Chikugo-no-kami, after which he was sent to the detention house. The Grand Chamberlain on duty was Lord Mizuno Iki-no-kami.

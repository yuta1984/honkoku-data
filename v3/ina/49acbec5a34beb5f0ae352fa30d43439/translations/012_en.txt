His Majesty the Emperor's birthday shall be celebrated annually as Tenchō-setsu (Emperor's Birthday Festival), with banquets granted to court officials, suspension and exemption of punishments throughout the realm, and sharing of celebratory blessings with the people. This was proclaimed two years ago, but there are still areas where His Majesty's intentions have not fully penetrated to the grassroots level. Therefore, all prefectures, domains, and counties shall embody this principle and ensure that all people celebrate His Majesty's birthday together. This directive is hereby reissued.

Humbly submitting this written petition
Item: Regarding the forest at the famous place called Kita-Matsuo, where boundaries for the lord's forest are to be established this time, since the said location exists separately from Seki lord's forest, we petition that a land exchange be ordered to the place called by the small name Kyūseki, where pine forests have been cultivated within the 25 chō of village common grassland connected to Seki lord's forest, needed for river flood control. If you would graciously order this as petitioned with your compassion, we would be most grateful. Above stated.

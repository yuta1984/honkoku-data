We have possessed the six locations in Yanagisawa, which we brought or received through transfer, each holding them for many years. However, you have graciously come to inspect these locations, and we have gradually been informed that these mountains are originally upper lord's forests. We have understood this intention for the first time and are deeply ashamed. If we consider them to be lord's forests, we certainly cannot receive or transfer them. However, understanding them to be people's private lands, we received them through transfer and possessed them, freely using them for firewood, house timber, grass cutting for fertilizer, and such. If they are now to be confiscated, we will face difficulties in making our living, and many who have no other mountains will suffer hardship. According to the purport of your pronouncement, if there is no doubt they are lord's forests, we have no way to make any appeal. We are terribly ashamed, but under these circumstances, we humbly request your mercy. Indeed, regarding the boundaries marked for the lord's forest, we have no complaints whatsoever. As stated in the previous section, we earnestly petition for your compassionate consideration and mercy in every respect. Therefore, the landowners jointly affix their seals and submit this document. Thus, as stated above.

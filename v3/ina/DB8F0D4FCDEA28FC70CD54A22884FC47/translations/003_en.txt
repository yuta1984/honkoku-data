General Memorandum of Inspection of Tatsuno Village Domain Forests

1. On the 15th day of the 9th month at midday, we moved to lower Tatsuno village and immediately inspected the Seki forest in the direction of Kita-Matsuo. Regarding the Seki forest, it matches the records as a mixed deciduous forest without discrepancy. The mixed forest at the famous place called Kita-Matsuo could not be found - it is entirely a pine forest. However, since the place name corresponds with the records, we believe there is no error regarding the domain forest. This concerns matters from over a hundred years ago, and we believe that as it was gradually considered private forest, pine trees grew up. As for the area measurement, the Seki forest alone would be narrow, but adding the Kita-Matsuo forest would make it an appropriate acreage. We withdrew around sunset (6 o'clock).

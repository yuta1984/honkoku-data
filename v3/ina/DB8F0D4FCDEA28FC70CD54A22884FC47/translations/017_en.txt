Respectfully, we humbly submit this written petition regarding the following matter:

Concerning the locations known as Kitaōmochi, Kokubo, Sumahoso, Bora, Yanagisawa, and Kirigakubo, we had understood that our ancestors from four or five generations ago possessed these forest lands as private holdings and had conducted transfers accordingly. During this inspection of the domain forests, when you came to conduct detailed inquiries and investigations, we learned for the first time that there was a correspondence with the domain location called Karakizawa, and that our ancestors had contracted as mountain guardians. We have no excuse whatsoever and are deeply ashamed.

We humbly accept your decree that boundaries will be established following your inspection. We do not know what misunderstanding our ancestors may have had, but if the lands that were transferred and are currently held by Kamishima Village and Imamura are to be reclaimed, we feel great pity for the current landholders. However, if this accords with the domain's intentions, we believe there is no alternative. We earnestly beseech your mercy that the landholders of Kamishima Village and Imamura may continue to make their living, and we repeatedly implore your compassion.

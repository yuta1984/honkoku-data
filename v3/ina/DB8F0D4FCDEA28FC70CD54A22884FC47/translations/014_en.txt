Regarding the written pledge submitted
Concerning Ōkubo at the famous place of Karakisawa Mountain, which our humble temple has brought, you have graciously come for inspection this time. Regarding this mountain, we have gradually been informed that it is originally an upper lord's forest, and we have understood this intention for the first time and are deeply ashamed. If we consider it to be a lord's forest, we certainly cannot receive or transfer it. However, understanding it to be people's holdings, we purchased and possessed it, freely cutting grass for fertilizer. If it is now to be confiscated, we will face difficulties in making our living. According to the purport of your pronouncement, if there is no doubt it is a lord's forest, we have no excuse whatsoever and are terribly ashamed. Under these circumstances, we humbly request your mercy. Even if you establish boundaries for the lord's forest, we have no complaints whatsoever. We earnestly petition for your compassion in every respect. Therefore, we affix our seal and submit this document. Thus, as stated above.

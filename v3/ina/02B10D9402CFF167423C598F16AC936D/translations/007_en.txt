Document of testimony submitted

Item: Regarding the lord's forest called Ōchikakura in our village, from the six-tenths section through the foothills area, including mountain fields of 4 tan 6 se 24 bu, this area was registered during the land survey in the Year of the Horse seven years ago, and afterwards we established it as private forest, which is certain. However, since you two gentlemen are now making inspection rounds, and there is no such documentation for this matter, when we reported that this area consists of private forest, upon your detailed investigation, many old trees were observed, and the exact boundaries could not be clearly determined, so we humbly request a renewed investigation and judgment

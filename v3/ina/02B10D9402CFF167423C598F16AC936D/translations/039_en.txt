[we] shall strictly prohibit [such activities]. If we overlook or fail to hear of violations, and when the government forest is inspected again, we face investigation to the point where we cannot make excuses, then not only the mountain guards but also the village officials shall be subject to severe punishment.

Article 1: If there are trees broken by wind, fallen trees, or dead standing trees within the government forest, we shall also promptly report these. Not only mountain guards but even village officials must not act freely in private matters without permission.

As stated above, we have understood each and every point that was conveyed to us following this inspection and investigation. Not only all the farmers in the village, but also elderly women, widows, men, women, children, and even servants shall be strictly instructed that they must not enter the government forest at all. If even one person in the village says "I do not acknowledge this" and enters the government forest to commit violations, after investigation, not only the mountain guards but also the village officials shall be subject to severe punishment. For future reference, the headman, group leaders, senior farmers, and mountain guards affix their seals and submit this document as written above.

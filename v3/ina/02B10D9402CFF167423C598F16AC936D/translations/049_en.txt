Written pledge submitted

Article 1: Regarding the forest inspection that was ordered this time, we understand and accept each point of the instructions. Therefore, we shall be even more diligent in protecting the lord's forest, ensuring that in thin areas, saplings and such will grow well. From now on, we shall not enter at all, not only for brush cutting but even for leaf gathering. If it comes to your attention that we have overlooked or ignored someone entering, whatever judgment may be rendered after investigation, we shall harbor no resentment whatsoever. Of course, we shall not cut undergrowth, lower branches, or anything else within the lord's forest without proper permission. Also, if there are any wind-broken or fallen trees, we shall promptly report them. This joint pledge document by the village head and group heads is for future reference. Therefore, as stated above.

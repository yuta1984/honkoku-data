...needless to say, even the village officials shall be subject to whatever punishment may be decreed.

Article: If there are trees broken by wind, fallen trees, or dead standing trees within the government forest, we shall also promptly report these matters. Not only the mountain guards, but even village officials must not act freely in private matters without official permission.

As stated above, we have understood every detail of what has been declared to us following this inspection and investigation. We will strictly instruct not only all the peasants in the village, but also the elderly women, women and children, and servants, so that they shall absolutely not enter the government forest. If even one person in the village claims "I did not know" and enters the government forest committing violations, after investigation, not only the mountain guards but also the village officials shall be subject to whatever punishment may be decreed. For future reference, we respectfully submit this document with the seals of the village headman, group leader, senior peasant, and mountain guard, as stated herein.

Written Pledge

Item: This time when the government forest of our village was inspected, at the boundary of the Nankoshi government forest, Genemon of our village made an error in judgment and cut down six or seven pine trees at the boundary. Your suspicions about this matter are justified and we have no excuse. Therefore, with village officials and senior farmers confirming the boundary and witnessing, we re-examined the government boundary, and it was indeed without doubt within the government forest. If so, Genemon's improper conduct has no excuse whatsoever. When this was reported and the matter was determined to require official investigation, considering the current circumstances, you graciously pardoned the fine for the aforementioned timber, and also excused us from the formal report. The village officials and senior farmers are most grateful for this consideration. Hereafter, we will ensure that no such confusing matters occur. At the boundary where trees were cut, we will plant saplings next spring. For future reference, thus as stated.

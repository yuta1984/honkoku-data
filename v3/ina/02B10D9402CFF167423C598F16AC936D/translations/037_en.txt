Article: For the inspection of the government forest this time, you made your rounds, and we guided you through all of the two government forest areas in our village without exception. As you saw with your own eyes, there are no discrepancies whatsoever in the government forest interior, the intertwined forest boundaries, etc. If it should come to your attention later that we provided incorrect guidance, we accept that any punishment may be decreed upon investigation.

Article: Needless to say regarding the government notice boards and prohibitions for the government forest that have been decreed from long ago, we have understood what was decreed following your rounds and examination this time.

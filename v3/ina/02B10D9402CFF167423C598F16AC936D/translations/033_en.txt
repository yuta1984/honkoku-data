Due to gradual negligence, we failed to give proper instructions to the forest guards or all the farmers in the village, including men, women, and children, and left things unattended. As a result, the government forest became carelessly and poorly managed, with saplings and such not growing properly, and there are many tree stumps and such. We have nothing to say in our defense regarding this investigation and are extremely troubled. From now on, we will strictly instruct all the farmers in the village, including men, women, and children, that they must not enter at all, not only for gathering brushwood but even for cutting undergrowth or collecting fallen leaves. If there are any who enter the forest and commit improper acts, as soon as we see or hear of it, we will go there and, needless to say with good hatchets or sickles, we will apprehend such persons and immediately report them to you. If we overlook or fail to hear of such incidents and there are new stumps and such, and we cannot justify ourselves at the next inspection, please impose any punishment not only on the forest guards but also on the village officials.

Article 1: Regarding wind-damaged or fallen trees within the government forest, we will also promptly report these. Not only the forest guards but even village officials must not act freely in secret without your permission. If we violate what you have instructed us today, please impose any punishment after investigation. For this reason,

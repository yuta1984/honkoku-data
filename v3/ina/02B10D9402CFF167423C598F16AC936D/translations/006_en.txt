Document of testimony submitted

Item: Regarding the lord's forest called Otai Kubo on the east side of the river in our village, the boundaries are as follows: to the south from the edge of the fields, to the east along the Shibayama road, to the north along the Onedō road, with the area within the pine groves being the lord's forest, and from there within the mixed woodland, from below the crossroad to the One road, to the south both pine and mixed trees toward the south-facing slope, including valleys, up to the field edges - all is the lord's forest without any confusion. However, regarding what we initially reported about the three-section passage with field boundaries from the southern field edge to the eastern Shibayama mountain border, we have no evidence whatsoever for this claim, so your suspicions are entirely justified. Therefore, we have no objection to considering the area from the field edge to the One road as the lord's forest. Furthermore, regarding Gengorōemon's holdings, from below the crossroad is the lord's forest, and from the road up to the One road is private forest - there is no discrepancy in what we reported. If anyone who made contradictory statements is later brought to your attention, upon your investigation and inquiry, they should be subject to whatever punishment you deem appropriate. This testimony document bears the seals of the village headman, group leaders, senior farmers, mountain guards, and landowners for future reference. Therefore, as stated above.

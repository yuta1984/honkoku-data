1. Regarding the government forest and bamboo grove prohibition signs and regulations that have been ordered from long ago, it goes without saying that we understand their purpose, but we have now acknowledged the instructions given after your recent inspection tour. We shall absolutely not enter the government forest and bamboo groves for any purpose whatsoever, including gathering fallen leaves, cutting undergrowth, or collecting bamboo bark. Furthermore, during bamboo shoot season, we shall construct proper fences so that good bamboo will grow well, and we shall carefully protect them without neglecting them. Should there be any fallen trees, wind-damaged trees, or snow-broken bamboo within the government forest and bamboo groves, we shall promptly report them. Even village officials, mountain guardians, and grove guardians shall not act freely without permission. For future reference, this certificate bears the seals of the village headman, group leader, senior farmer, mountain guardian, and grove guardian. Thus as stated.

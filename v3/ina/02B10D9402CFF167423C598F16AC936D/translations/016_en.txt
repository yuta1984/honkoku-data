Item: Henceforth, we shall especially protect the protected forest, plant additional saplings to make them flourish,

　　patrol matters, we shall consult with the officials and serve according to their directions.
　　Most importantly, we shall strictly and carefully observe all matters according to the established laws of the protected forest

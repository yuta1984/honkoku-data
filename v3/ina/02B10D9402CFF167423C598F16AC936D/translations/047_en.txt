Document submitted as testimony:

Regarding the lord's forest called "Ōkachikura" in our village: concerning the mountain field of 4 tan, 6 se, and 24 bu from the sixth section to the foot path, we submitted a request during the land survey in the Horse year, twenty-seven years ago. Subsequently, we established this area as private forest, which certainly exists. However, when you both made your inspection rounds and conducted your examination this time, there was immediately no confusion regarding this matter, so we reported that this area constitutes private forest. Upon your thorough investigation, many ancient markers and such were observed, but the precise boundaries of ownership are not clearly visible, so we request that through repeated petitions and your deliberation, the boundaries be properly established.

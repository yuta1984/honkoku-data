Article 1: Regarding the area within Ashigahora forest of our village, west of the middle road, where I claimed it was my holding, since the matter remained unclear and unresolved, when both myself and the officials were questioned about whether there might be solid evidence kept privately, there was no evidence whatsoever. Moreover, since the official notice board stands in the very place I claimed as my holding, it was deemed increasingly suspicious, and it was declared that henceforth it shall be made into a lord's forest. I humbly accept this and consider it most reasonable. I do not consider it unreasonable in the slightest. This document is for future reference, as stated above.

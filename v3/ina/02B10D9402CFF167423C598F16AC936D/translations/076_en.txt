The intent of these regulations goes without saying, and we have understood the instructions given to us following this inspection and examination. Regarding the forest groves, in recent years they have been entrusted to the village officials, but due to constant negligence, not only the mountain guards but even all the peasants in the village, men, women, and children, have been left without proper instruction, resulting in careless neglect. The saplings have failed to grow and the forests have become desolate, leaving us with no excuse when subjected to examination. From now on, we shall ensure that the saplings and trees in the forest groves grow and flourish properly. Should there be any wrongdoers from our village or other villages who enter the forest groves and commit offenses, we will go immediately upon seeing or hearing of such incidents and confiscate not only any good hatchets or sickles but all tools, apprehend the offenders, and report them to you. If they are from other domains, we will only confiscate their tools, not harm the persons in any way, ascertain their names, and notify the headman of their village. Should we overlook any wrongdoers and new tree stumps or damage be discovered during subsequent inspections, making it difficult to provide an acceptable explanation during examination, please impose whatever punishment you deem appropriate on not only the mountain guards but also the village officials.

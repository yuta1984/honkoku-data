...having been neglected, the grove guardians have been negligent, and good bamboo has not grown in the protected bamboo groves, which have become like mere bamboo grass thickets. As you suspect, there is no excuse we can offer. When spring comes, we shall have the villagers clear away grove trees, dead bamboo, bamboo grass, undergrowth, and such, and we shall diligently tend the area so that good bamboo shoots may grow.

Item: If there are snow-broken bamboo or standing dead bamboo within the protected bamboo grove, we shall report it. Not only the grove guardians, but even village officials must not act freely in private without permission.

As stated above, we have understood each and every point of the instructions given during this inspection tour. Therefore, we shall take great care to protect the groves and ensure that good bamboo grows. Furthermore, we shall convey the instructions given on this occasion to all the villagers, men, women, and children alike, and we shall take special care during bamboo shoot season. For future reference, the village headman, group leaders, senior farmers, and grove guardians affix their seals accordingly.

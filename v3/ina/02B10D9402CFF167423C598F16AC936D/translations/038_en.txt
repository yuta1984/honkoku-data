In recent years, [the forest] was entrusted to the village officials and left in their care, but due to constant negligence, neither the mountain guards nor all the farmers in the village, including men, women, and children, were given proper instructions and were left unmanaged. As a result, the government forest became carelessly neglected, saplings failed to grow properly, and there are no official marks on trees regardless of their size. Not only are there stumps from brush cutting from two or three years ago, but there are also fresh stumps from recent times, and we now face this investigation. There is no excuse for the suspicion and scolding regarding the negligence of not only the mountain guards but even the village officials in their daily duties. From now on, we will strictly instruct all farmers in the village, including men, women, and children, that except for the mountain guards, no one shall enter [the forest] for brush cutting, leaf gathering, undergrowth, or grass under trees. If there are any violators who enter the government forest to cut brush or gather leaves, as soon as we see or hear of it, we will go and confiscate their good hatchets and sickles, restrain the person, and immediately report to you. If people from other domains come and commit violations, we will only confiscate their tools, not harm the person in any way, record their names in the register, and [report] to the headman of that village.

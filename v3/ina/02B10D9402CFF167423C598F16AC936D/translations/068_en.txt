Document of Testimony Submitted

Item: Regarding rough farmland of eighteen bu in the northwest area of our village's御林 (government forest),
　　The landowner had established it as a private forest. During this official inspection, it was said to be confusing,
　　but there is no confusion with the private forest. If there should be anyone who claims this is government forest,
　　or if such matters should reach your ears, not only the landowner but also
　　the village officials and even the guides may be summoned, and we accept that any
　　punishment may be imposed upon us. This document serves as testimony for future reference. Thus as stated.

　　　Certificate Document Submitted
Item: In the protected forest of this village, we have served as forest guardians for generations,
　　but gradually committed improper and inadequate acts, and in the past Tsuchinoe year, after investigation
　　we were dismissed from the forest guardian position, and furthermore our crimes were examined for severity
　　and we were assigned punishment accordingly. We humbly accept this with not a single word of objection
　　regarding this matter.
Item: Although our forest guardian position was revoked, given that I committed improprieties,
　　needless to say, I believe this will cause trouble not only to our reputation in society but also to our descendants

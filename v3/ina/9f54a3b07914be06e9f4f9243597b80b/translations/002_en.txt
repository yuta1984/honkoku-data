A written pledge submitted herewith

Item: Regarding the matter of stone cutters in our village, we have thoroughly investigated and found that there are no persons other than those reported in this year's registration. Having established this, we have instructed the stone cutters to conduct themselves with complete honesty and propriety in their business dealings while traveling, and they have acknowledged this. Should you hear that we have concealed anyone by removing them from the registry, we will report this matter to you. Having acknowledged this, no matter what punishment may be imposed upon us, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. This pledge is written for future reference, therefore as stated above.

Regarding the Permanent Transfer of Residential Land and Field

One: We hereby permanently transfer the upland field of 2 se 20 bu located on the Miyasaka residential land that we possess. As礼金 (ceremonial payment) for this, we have just now certainly received ten ryō in gold. This is absolutely correct. From now on, please fulfill your duties regarding annual rice tax and corvée labor obligations according to the account books. Regarding this field, neither relatives nor anyone else from the surroundings has any objection whatsoever. Should anyone raise any improper claims from outside parties, the guarantor will take responsibility and definitely resolve the matter, ensuring that you will not be caused even the slightest trouble or hardship. However, regarding the bamboo grove, we shall manage it permanently on our side as agreed upon. Accordingly, as annual tax for the grove land, we shall pay two gō of rice annually on our side. Even if any new circumstances should arise in the future, we will not violate this agreement in the slightest. We hereby create this field transfer certificate as future evidence.

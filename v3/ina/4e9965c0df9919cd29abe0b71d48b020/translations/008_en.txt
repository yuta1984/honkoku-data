1. From Takato to the next village:
　　It is called Kurita village. It is two ri away.
　　From that village to Mido-gaigai it is one ri.
　　From there is Kanazawa Pass, which is
　　a three-ri pass.
　　You would cross over that and proceed
　　to Kanazawa post station.

1. I have no recollection of a place called Kanazawa.
　Although you mentioned that there is
　a place called Aoyagi post station, when I insisted
　that it is called Kanazawa,
　you acknowledged that this was correct.

1. If that is the case, then at Inabu village
　it would split into two routes, would it not? In any case,
　we would have to go to Komaba village again.
　　We humbly request that we might
　　be allowed to proceed all the way to Iida.

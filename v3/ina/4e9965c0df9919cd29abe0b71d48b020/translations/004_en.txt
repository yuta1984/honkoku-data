[We] made inquiry to the Survey Officials,
and furthermore wished to make arrangements regarding
reception methods at lodgings and various other matters,
so we came here. We requested that though we would be
troubling them recently, please give us favorable
consideration. When we made this request,
they acknowledged it and said they would certainly provide assistance.
They said they would also inform the village officials
about this matter. Then we stayed one night at
Yaheiji's place. Through Yaheiji's introduction,
　　　　　　Asuke village officials　Kyūzaemon
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Hikoshichi
We met these two officials and made our
request. They acknowledged it and when they
reported to the Survey Officials,
[we received] orders to promptly accompany them
and come out. Therefore, accompanied by Kyūzaemon
and Hikoshichi, we went to the honjin
where Shimokōbe Magogorō-sama
graciously met with us, [learning that we] had come from Takatō.

Each household takes along town representatives and officials when
going out. According to precedent, not only town officials but also individual
town representatives would each pay silver per district to the junior officials (kogashira) for
formal introduction and make individual courtesy calls, but recently
all officials go together, and names, surnames, and given names are
called out individually for formal introduction.
After expressing gratitude and saying "We are most grateful to have been able
to safely add another year to our lives," the junior officials
offer their greetings, and we humbly accept with gratitude.
Of course, the protocol when town officials make visits is:
During formal occasions (onari):
They should go to the seats where the lord and senior officials
are seated, and also go to where the magistrates are
seated to express their gratitude.
Town representatives and officials, after going out, attend
and receive acknowledgment. At that time, alongside the ward representatives and
village heads, those in senior positions
receive gracious words and express their humble gratitude.

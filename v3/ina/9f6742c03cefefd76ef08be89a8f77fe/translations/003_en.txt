New Year
1. When the lord is in residence at the castle, lead is to be presented as tribute
　However:
　　　Ward representatives (tonya): 7 pieces, Village heads (nanushi): 5 pieces (on white wooden stands with legs)
　　　
　　　When there are assistant roles, they follow the same procedure as village heads
　　　Wrap in ceremonial paper (hōsho) with colored mizuhiki cords and attach noshi
　　　Attach name tags with surname and given name
　　　Town representatives and officials should present 2 pieces each
　　　Name tags should indicate "Town representative of [district name]"

1. According to precedent, ward representatives and village heads used to make individual greetings,
　but from around Bunka 7, Year of the Horse (1810), the three began going
　together. Since assistant roles were created at this time, this
　arrangement was established.

1. After the above courtesy calls are completed, one person from the Egata group provides guidance
　so that the supervising town officials, town representatives, and officials can make New Year
　greetings to the senior councilors and elders and other related parties.
　This is reported to the related parties' attendants and castle deputy groups.

1. For the chamberlains and chief inspectors, the other related parties privately
　record in the official register "town officials, town representatives, and officials."
　After this extended duty is completed,
　consult with the inner residence staff at both magistrates' offices
　to ensure there is no confusion in the sequence of events.

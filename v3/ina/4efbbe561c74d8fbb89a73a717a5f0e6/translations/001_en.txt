Letter Written on Behalf of Another

Recently, thank you for taking the time to visit me despite your busy schedule. Regarding the matter of sending messengers to invite you several times, I heard from Sakuemon-san that you did not come except for one occasion. Therefore, I thoroughly investigated the messengers, and I would like to request that you visit briefly, even though it may be troublesome, accompanied by Sakuemon-san. I am writing this letter to convey this matter. That is all.

November 29th, Renshoan

To the Master Stone Mason

Memorandum of Verbal Communication

The other day, I had the honor of calling upon you and leisurely receiving your thoughts, which I consider most gratifying. Regarding the matter of expressing gratitude for the imperial letter that you mentioned on that occasion, I am writing this letter to you as follows. However, as you informed me, due to complications with private consultations, you have not submitted a letter to the Council of Elders (rōjū) on this matter. Given this situation, should I no longer pursue this matter? In any case, please give it your favorable consideration and let me know your thoughts. I am writing this first. Furthermore, if you have any urgent matters or words in mind, please inform me. I will revise and resubmit accordingly. The above.

February 12th　　Former Dainagon Yanagiwara

To Lord Naitō Yamato-no-kami

[Postscript]
Furthermore, regarding the date, I have used the date when I last called upon your residence, but due to various impediments over the past two or three days, this has been delayed, for which I am deeply apologetic. I shall call upon you in person soon to express my apologies.

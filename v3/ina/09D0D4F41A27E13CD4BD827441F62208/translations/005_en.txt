《Postscript: Furthermore, regarding prices, I will do my utmost to offer the best rates possible. Please urgently send the goods as requested. Upon their arrival, I will immediately send the payment. The above.》

I write to you taking advantage of this convenient opportunity. Though the season has become warm, I trust that you are in increasingly good health, which I find most gratifying. Now then, the other day I had the honor of calling upon you and meeting with you face to face, for which I am most grateful. Regarding the matter we discussed at that time, I was supposed to bring the deposit money as arranged, but due to various large purchases, my remaining funds are insufficient. Although it is a small amount, I am sending up to three ryō in gold. Please accept it. Of course, as soon as the goods arrive, I will promptly send the payment from Nagoya. I will do my utmost regarding the prices, so please urgently send the goods as requested.

Also, regarding the settlement accounts from the other day, I will organize them upon returning home and send the accounts by regular post. As for the payment for the remaining goods, since I have no documents, please inform me each time. I will promptly remit payment on those occasions.

First, I am sending the deposit money, so please confirm and accept it. Afterward, I will call upon you again to pay my respects.

Hastily, the above.

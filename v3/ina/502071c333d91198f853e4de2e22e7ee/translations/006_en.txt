Regarding the Agreement Document We Have Discussed and Decided Upon

Your son Inosaburo-dono, through the mediation of Kitahara Rizaemon-dono, shall receive our daughter Yasu as wife and adopted son, and shall inherit as successor. Upon this arrangement, we have decided to transfer without exception all of our holdings—four mountain forests, rice fields, other farmland, and house compound—as family inheritance. Although there is one young boy named Yae, regarding this matter, should he establish a branch family upon reaching adulthood, we shall give him one house lot at the corner on the south side of Shimo-machi. However, since this property is currently pledged to Sawaya Hatsutaro, when it can be redeemed, we shall transfer it along with the redemption money. Regarding other capital funds and household goods, we leave these to Inosaburo-dono's discretion.

Furthermore, we shall add one-third of our farmland holdings and one mountain forest location at Donguri-zaka in Itamachi village.

However, when the main family is not prospering, even if no branch family is established, we shall leave all matters to Inosaburo-dono's judgment. Also, when we reach old age and retire, no separate retirement allowance will be necessary. Should things not work out well in the future and divorce occur...

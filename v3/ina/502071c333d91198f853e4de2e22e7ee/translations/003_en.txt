Document Regarding Mutual Agreement

Your son Inosaburo has, through the good offices of Mr. Kitahara Rizaemon, taken our daughter Yasu as wife in an adoptive marriage arrangement and will inherit the family headship as successor.

Therefore, we hereby agree to transfer all of our holdings without exception: four mountain forest areas, rice fields and other farmland, house and residential land, and family headship to him. We have one young son named Yakei, but should he establish a branch family when he comes of age, we will provide him with one residential plot that we own at the southern corner of Shimomachi. However, if this property needs to be returned to the Sawaya Hatsutaro family, we will provide compensation in money instead. All other startup funds and household goods shall be at the discretion of Inosaburo.

Furthermore, we will add one-third of our farmland holdings plus one mountain forest area at Tonkuri slope in Itamachi village. However, if it proves inconvenient for the main family, we need not establish the branch family, and everything shall be left to Inosaburo's judgment. Even when we retire due to advanced age, no separate retirement stipend will be required.

Should there unfortunately be discord leading to divorce in the future, we will transfer to Inosaburo one residential property in Nakamachi Minamigawa and thirty ryo in startup funds. If the person herself withdraws, we will provide startup funds according to the circumstances at that time.

Having made these agreements, there shall be no deviation between us henceforth. This agreement document is executed for future reference.

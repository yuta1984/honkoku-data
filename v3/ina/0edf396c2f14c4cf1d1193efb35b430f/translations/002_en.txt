[Continuation from previous page]
He built a storehouse, purchased rice fields, and his assessed rice yield at that time amounted to four or five koku or more. However, in the recent Year of the Dog, he sold off not only the stones that had been cut and stockpiled from the concession rights I had transferred to him over several years, but also roughly disposed of the stone-cutting tools and other household goods and implements, converting them to money before returning to his home province. Yet he sent no money to my household and gave no word of explanation. Therefore, despite my repeated demands, when no resolution was forthcoming, I appealed this matter to the aforementioned guarantor Saburoemon. Saburoemon then proposed through his mediation that the matter be settled for a mere five ryo in gold. However, given that there was a considerable amount of money involved and numerous tools and implements, I believe such a settlement would be difficult to accept. I humbly request that the accumulated stones and various tools and implements be investigated through the separate document attached.

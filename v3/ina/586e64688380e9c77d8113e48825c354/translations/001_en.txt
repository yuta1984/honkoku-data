Written Pledge

Regarding the matter of town night watch duties: Previously, Miyasaka (village) has been taking turns with everyone in performing these duties. This time, after your village accepted our request, through Fujiya Gunji, we have requested that you reliably perform night watch duties four nights each month, from the first night to the fourth night of each month beginning, and that this arrangement be communicated in turn throughout the town. Since you have accepted this request and the town has also agreed, we hereby acknowledge and confirm this arrangement. Therefore, regardless of any future circumstances, you shall reliably perform four nights of duty each month, and the town will handle the remaining nights. Having made this agreement, there shall never be any violations extending to future generations. We submit this written pledge as evidence for posterity.

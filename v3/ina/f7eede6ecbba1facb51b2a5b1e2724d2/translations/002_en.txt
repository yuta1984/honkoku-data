Item: Regarding Takato town, as it is located in a remote border region, even the rural areas are predominantly mountainous, so commerce is particularly limited. We gradually transport local products and procure various necessities. When we have accumulated enough of these goods to form cargo loads, we pay transport fees to pack horse operators (chūma) and send goods not only to the Iida area but also to the Owari and Mikawa provinces, where we sell them at local market prices. With the proceeds, we procure goods needed locally, which then become return cargo for the pack horses - this has been our established practice from long ago. Not only for round trips to Iida, but also to Owari province

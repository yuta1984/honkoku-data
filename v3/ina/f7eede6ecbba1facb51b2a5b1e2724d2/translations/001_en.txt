A Matter Humbly Submitted for Inquiry Through This Written Statement

Recently, there has been movement of cargo by packhorse transport (nakama) along the Ina road. For inspection purposes, Mr. Kikuchi Sōnai and Mr. Kawashima Tōhachi came to conduct an examination. During their investigation, we petitioned regarding the passage of cargo, whereupon they informed us that the matter would be referred to Edo for inquiry, and that instructions would come from the current administrative office. Therefore, we humbly submit this inquiry. We request that appropriate measures be taken according to the forthcoming instructions.

Regarding the above petition, if the directives from Edo are implemented as requested, we would consider it a most grateful outcome. The above stated.

Things to be avoided:

First, constantly consume mixed grain porridge morning and evening, eat coarse food, and make it a primary concern to store various goods.

First, collect and store kudzu roots, bracken roots, wild burdock, mugwort, daikon radish, turnip greens, ramie, eggplant, cowpeas, potato stems, carrots, burdock leaves, and even magnolia seeds. Use them as appropriate for current needs, and for suitable items, use them as additions to food. Even red-stemmed vegetables and various greens should be mindfully stored by everyone, including children, during spare time from work.

First, regarding rice bran, dried lees, soy sauce lees, wheat bran, wild rice, and similar items, each household should prepare these provisions by either drying and grinding them, or mixing them with salt into pounded miso for use.

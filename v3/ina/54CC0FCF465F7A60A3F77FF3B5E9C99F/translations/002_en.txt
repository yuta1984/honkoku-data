Regulations

Article 1: Due to financial difficulties, we have repeatedly ordered frugality measures from before, but our domain has no surplus from the beginning, and in recent years we have been unable to manage financing from other sources during these difficult times. Our officials have reported that it has become extremely difficult to cover essential expenditures at this critical juncture. We have been conducting gradual examinations since spring, implementing exceptionally drastic reductions in all matters, eliminating this and reducing that through detailed deliberations. However, since we have already been practicing simplicity, no immediate inconveniences are apparent. Regarding the retainers, there have been several occasions of forced loans in the past, and we still have such loans in place. Their continuous state of poverty is pitiful, so we have always wished to find some way to improve their situation. While it is difficult to issue further orders, our financial difficulties are so severe that continuation seems uncertain. Despite our hardships, we now must once again [impose measures] on all retainers both in the domain and in Edo.

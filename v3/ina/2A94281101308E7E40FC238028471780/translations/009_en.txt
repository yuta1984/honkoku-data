4th day
- Regarding the permit inspection duties for master carpenter Nakamura Magoichi
  Completed from the 8th to the 11th day. Therefore, we are sending him back. As usual, we requested through the construction magistrate that rest days be granted as customary, and conveyed this to Magoichi verbally.

Same day
- The permit inspections were completed as of today.

12th day
- Regarding the master carpenter's tool box matter: Initially it was arranged to be sent from the construction office, but since no nakama (servant) was immediately available, we temporarily had our office receive the nakama tool box. Ito Ichizo's colleague requested that someone be sent to retrieve it. We explained that this does not establish a precedent, so we sent a nakama from the official department to retrieve the tool box to the work hut. When the permit inspections are completed and the master carpenter returns, it is the established precedent that we return the tool box from our side, so this morning we had a nakama carry it there.

Same day
- The nakama handled the retrieval and return of items.
  (For half a day)

- The permit inspections were completed as of yesterday.

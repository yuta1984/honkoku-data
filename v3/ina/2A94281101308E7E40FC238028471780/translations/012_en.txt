If such a person is found, he should be detained at the magistrate's office. For shogunal domains, report to the magistrate; for private domains, report to the domain lord or local administrator, and from there report to Lord Magabuchi Kai-no-kami in Edo. If anyone hears or sees anything relevant, that should also be reported. Of course, retainers and servants should be carefully questioned.

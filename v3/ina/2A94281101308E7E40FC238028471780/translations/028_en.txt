We humbly submit this written petition
One, Regarding Sadenju of this village, who until last winter was engaged in the dyer's trade with two indigo vats, but died suddenly of illness last winter. Until now we have not requested permission to discontinue his trade license, and being new to our roles, we failed to notice this - we consider this extremely negligent. We humbly wish to discontinue the dyer's trade [registration]. If you would graciously grant our petition and give your permission, all the village officials would be most grateful. The above.

Regarding the matter of visiting your residence and having an audience with you, we learned confidentially that concerning the subordinate official Hagizaemon, since there are other concerns here as well, we are considering appointing a successor subordinate official. Therefore, we were asked to write down the names of four or five suitable candidates for your review first. Furthermore, there was thorough consultation with your colleague officials, and we were to prepare and bring the names of successor subordinate officials by tomorrow evening. After that, we would pay our respects again. Since we were told this was a confidential matter, we informed our colleague officials and held discussions, stating that we would submit the written names by tomorrow evening.

Same 6th day

If there remains calculation work for rice fields and dry fields requiring surveying, finish even at half past eight (yatsu-han). Ensure that the contract ledger (ukechō) can be completed within one day.

1. The aforementioned contract ledger should be in horizontal format (yokochō) and delivered to the village for one day, or for periods of about two days each. With village officials present, examine it for the landowners, and when one village is completed, apply the final endorsement and seal (okuaki ingyō). Moreover, for each page of the ledger, three local magistrates (daikan) should record their seals, and seals should also be applied to any erasures or additions.

1. The preparation of various ledger documents should follow the separate ledger as a guide.

The above points are communicated for your understanding. Furthermore, if any matters come to attention, inquire about them each time. That is all.

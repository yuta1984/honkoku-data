11th month of the Rabbit year [1823]

Regarding the matter of town ranking, the following was understood by the officials dispatched from the government office:

1. Recently, His Lordship issued orders regarding the lowering of prices for various goods due to the decline in grain prices. When the ward representatives of the ten towns submitted a written pledge through the town officials with joint seals, and around the time the town officials submitted a draft regarding town ranking matters, they proposed that based on the town ranking used when presenting tribute items during His Lordship's centennial celebration, the three towns of Honmachi, Nakamachi, and Shimonochi should take the highest seats. However, the representatives of the seven towns stated that according to tradition passed down from former officials, the protocol for the centennial celebration involved determining the order of towns by lottery, and since other matters had not been conducted in this manner according to past custom, they repeatedly petitioned the town officials that they wished to continue all affairs as they had been. Although this was not taken up at all, thinking that proceeding as proposed would certainly form the basis for unifying all ten towns, the representatives of the seven towns had no choice but to petition the town officials that they wished to resign from their posts en masse, and furthermore conveyed this intention privately to us as well.

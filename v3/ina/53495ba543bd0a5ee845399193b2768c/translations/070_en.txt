The aforementioned Kumano Gongen shrine and Inari shrine have suffered major damage, so as assistance for their debt relief, fundraising throughout the provinces has been permitted. Bearing fundraising documents with the joint seals of the temple and shrine magistrates, they will make rounds through shogunal domains, private domains, temple and shrine lands, and rural towns for three years from this October of the Rabbit year until September of the coming Horse year. Believers should make donations regardless of the amount, and this should be announced by magistrates in shogunal domains and by lords and district heads in private domains.
　August, Rabbit Year　　　　　　Copied on September 21st

Regarding the remaining portions of old gold and silver coins and ni-shu coins that were not exchanged, there are considerable amounts left. After announcing the exchange of shinji ni-bu coins, unscrupulous people continued to hold large amounts shortly thereafter, so the exchange period was extended until October of this Rabbit year.

This matter was previously announced, but since there are still remaining shinji ni-bu coins and other old gold and silver ni-bu coins that have not been exchanged, the exchange offices will continue to operate as before until October of the coming Dragon year.
As previously announced in successive notices, when exchange arrangements for distant provinces are properly organized, permission will be granted, and for those who present old gold and silver ni-bu coins, regardless of location, even if the distance to the gold and silver mint or the nearest exchange route exceeds five ri, travel expenses will be provided appropriately according to the amount presented to those who repeatedly present gold of 500 ryō or more, silver of 10 kan-me or more, or ni-shu coins of 200 ryō or more. However, at the present time, both old gold and silver coins and ni-shu coins remain in various provinces.

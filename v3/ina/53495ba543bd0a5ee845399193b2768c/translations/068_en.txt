Magistrates in shogunal domains and lords/district heads in private domains should report to the Tsutsui Iga-no-kami office in Edo and elsewhere. If anyone sees or hears anything, they should report it at that stage. Of course, retainers and their subordinates should conduct thorough investigations. If information comes to light from hiding places or other sources, it will be considered a serious offense.
　　April, Year of the Rabbit
Recently, both peasants and townspeople have been conducting large-scale funerals inappropriate to their social status, and have also been erecting magnificent stone monuments in graveyards and attaching temple names and lay Buddhist names, which is improper. From now on, regarding funerals for peasants and townspeople, even for those of distinguished background or with notable lineage, no more than ten monks should be gathered, and elaborate ceremonies should not be conducted. Donations and offerings should also be made according to one's financial means.

Regarding grave monuments, even tall gravestones should not exceed four shaku in height, and temple names or lay Buddhist names should absolutely not be attached to posthumous names. Of course, existing stone monuments should be left as they are for now, but when repairs are needed in the future, the temple names and lay Buddhist names should be removed and the monuments replaced.
These instructions should be proclaimed without exception to all shogunal domains, private domains, and temple/shrine territories.
　April
As stated above, since an official notice has been issued from the government office, this should be announced throughout the towns. That is all.

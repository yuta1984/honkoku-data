If that is the case, then overall, the matter of our town is a matter of the ten towns acting as one body, and claims about town status rankings should never be made. Regarding this matter, the representatives of the seven towns had consulted together and even petitioned to resign from their posts. If they were to be divided into seven towns and three towns, it would become the basis for discord among all and prevent proper communication of intentions.

However, this time the town officials' petition also had merit, so only for this current document, joint sealing will be done according to the aforementioned town ranking. This matter will be concluded with this instance alone, and henceforth, as the seven towns wished, all affairs will be conducted as they have been up to now.

1. On the 25th day of the 10th month, at the government office, the dispatched officials Akamura Jūnosuke-sama and Shibusawa Eishirō-sama issued the following decree: Regarding the document submitted to the town officials this time, the matter of dividing into seven towns and three towns is reprehensible and improper. For future matters, understand that all affairs should be conducted as they have been up to now. For New Year's greetings, formal audiences, return to castle, palanquin ceremonies and such occasions, attend with the understanding that has been maintained up to now. For other town proclamation matters, the monthly officials should handle them in town order starting from neighboring towns. For other joint-signature documents and such matters, write them in ward order from among the lower towns and receiving towns as has been done up to now.

Should the Shogunate or the local lord ever issue orders to write the ward order at any time, on each such occasion consult with the government office for instructions.

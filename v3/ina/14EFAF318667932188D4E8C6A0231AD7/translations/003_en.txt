　　Religious Sect Certificate Matter
One: Regarding this person called Izawa Magohachi and his entire household, their religious sect has been Zen Sōtō sect for generations, and they are without doubt parishioners of our temple. Should there be anyone who accuses them from elsewhere of belonging to the Christian sect, I (the priest) will go anywhere and definitely report this matter. I hereby provide this religious sect certificate for future reference.

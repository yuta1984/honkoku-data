　　Brief Record of the Origins of Jurinji Temple
This temple was founded during the reign of Emperor Go-Yōzei, in the sixth year of Keichō (1601), the year of the Metal Ox, by the then lord of Takato Castle, Hoshina Danjō-chū Masanao. The founding priest was the former abbot Yūyo Hōin of Kongōchō-in at Mount Kōya. Originally, it was a branch temple of the Old Shingon sect's Kongōchō-in at Mount Kōya and was called Inariyama Shingon-in Jurinji Temple. Later, it was revived as a New Shingon sect temple. According to tradition, when the Hoshina family previously held dominion over Tago in Shimōsa Province, there was a temple there called Inariyama Jurinji Temple, which became the object of the family's devotion and faith. When they moved their domain to Takato, they relocated this temple to the present location. The Kannon Hall that currently exists within the temple grounds was actually the main hall of that time, with Yūgao Kannon as the principal deity, but later during the Hōei era (1704-1711)

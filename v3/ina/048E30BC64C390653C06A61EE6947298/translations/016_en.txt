The fourth abbot of this temple, Seizan, separately constructed a main hall and enshrined Dainichi Nyorai. This temple is positioned in the northeastern direction (kimon) relative to Takato Castle, and since its founding had been the prayer temple of the Hoshina family. However, in the twelfth year of Kan'ei (1635), the year of the Wood Boar, when Torii Shuzen-shō Tadaharu became lord of Takato Castle, it also became the prayer temple of his family. From the fourth year of Genroku (1691), the year of the Metal Sheep, when Naitō Suruga-no-kami Kiyohira became castle lord, until the abolition of the castle in the second year of Meiji (1869), for nearly one hundred and eighty years it served as the prayer temple of the Naitō family. During this period, a certain amount of money and grain was granted to this temple annually. In the second year of Keiō (1866), the year of the Fire Tiger, the then castle lord Naitō Wakasa-no-kami Yorinao rebuilt the temple buildings. This is the current main hall of our temple. The abbots of this temple, from the founding abbot Yūyo to the present day, number fourteen generations, spanning two hundred and ninety-five years from the founding to this year.

This temple originally had more than ten branch temples, but many have fallen into ruin, and it is now a head temple with eight existing branch temples.

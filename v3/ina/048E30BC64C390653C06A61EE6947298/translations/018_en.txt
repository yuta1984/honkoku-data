The family rejoiced greatly, received the image reverently, and returned to a temporary hermitage built with thatched sprouts, where they first enshrined the sacred image. This is why it came to be called the Yūgao Kannon. The bottle gourd flower is commonly called the yūgao flower because it blooms when evening approaches. Danjō-chū was originally enfeoffed at Takato, but due to certain circumstances was demoted and resided in Takō. Since he constantly believed in and revered this sacred image, there were frequent miraculous responses. When Danjō-chū deeply prayed before the image of Daishi about ending his exile due to slander, he suddenly experienced a divine dream, and before long received a pardon and was able to return to Takato again. He finally built a temple on this site and called it Jurinji so as not to forget its original roots. He then commissioned a master craftsman to copy the Yūgao Kannon sacred image from Takō, enshrined it there, and additionally donated thirty koku of fertile rice fields along with mountain forests to provide resources for Buddhist offerings. This was in the year Keichō 6, the year of the Metal Ox (1601). Later, Danjō-chū received orders to relocate to Aizu, and had Torii Shuzen-sho Tadaharu govern Takato. After Tadaharu's death, his eldest son Sakyō-no-suke Tadataka inherited the headship and governed Takato. Through the two generations of Tadaharu and Tadataka, they maintained faith in Kannon, and the mountain forests continued according to the precedent of the Hoshina family's donations. When Tadataka occasionally visited this temple, due to the passage of many years, the temple hall's exterior had considerably deteriorated. Tadataka sighed deeply and finally gathered materials and workers to reconstruct it. In no time, magnificent and solemn decorations were completed, illuminating the mountain forests.

Indeed, even offering a single flower or blade of grass to Buddha brings immeasurable merit, how much more so when constructing and adorning temple halls. Not only does this cause worshippers to plant seeds of good karma, but one also increases one's own blessings and merit, and moreover Daishi constantly provides invisible protection, enabling one to permanently escape from suffering and misfortune. Because the people of the domain did not know this history, the retainer Takasu repeatedly requested that I record it to show both clergy and laypeople. Therefore, I take up the brush to fulfill this responsibility.

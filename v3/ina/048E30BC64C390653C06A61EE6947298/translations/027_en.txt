The founding of this temple began in the first year of Bunwa (1352), and by the fifth year of Enbun it acquired proper temple status. Initially, following the orders of Myōjitsu Shōnin, the second head priest of Myōken-ji, the main temple of the Nichiren sect in Kyoto, a man named Dōgen came to this district and resided in Kitahara village. He was pure and upright in character and well-versed in our sect's teachings. All who heard his sermons were pleased and submitted to his teachings. Therefore, Dōgen consulted with like-minded people and built a hall in Takato Seri-chō, naming it Kōtsū-sho (Propagation Place). The Shōnin sent disciples to work with Dōgen to expand the sect's teachings, and the number of believers grew ever greater. After nine years had passed, in the fifth year of Enbun, they abolished the Kōtsū-sho and rebuilt it as a proper Buddhist temple, naming it Myōhōzan Renge-ji. At that time, the Shōnin came and performed the completion ceremony. Thus they revered the Shōnin as the founding abbot, and the temple belonged to Myōken-ji. Not long after, on April 3rd of the second year of Jōji, the founding abbot passed away, and Dōgen also left this place, going to Tanba where he established another temple. This was Renge-ji in Tanada village, [?]da district. Dōgen eventually died in Tanba. At this time the temple hardly flourished, and since the distance to the main temple was very great and quite inconvenient, the second abbot Nissei petitioned the main temple to transfer affiliation to Kuon-ji on Mount Minobu, received permission, and changed the temple name to Chōon-ji. Later, during the Keichō era (over 300 years ago), Hoshina Higo-no-kami, lord of Takato Castle, donated the present site and moved the temple here. Later, during the Shōhō era, in the time of the nineteenth abbot Nichiryū, conflicts arose between the main and branch temples that could not be resolved, so they finally returned the temple name to Minobu, once again belonged to Myōken-ji, and changed the temple name to Renge-ji.

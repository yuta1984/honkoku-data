Regarding these individuals, on the 25th day of last month,
which was the appointed day for the religious sect inspection
at the government office, there had been
disputes and conflicts within the town from some time before,
and although neighboring towns intervened
and attempted to mediate,
the situation remained unsatisfactory, and matters were reported
to the town office. Despite these reports to the office
and attempts by the office
to maintain order,
it was extremely ineffective. Furthermore, the former officials
and group leaders privately gathered together
and discussed various town matters,
causing delays in the religious sect seal documents.

As for the public appearance, they claimed that it would be
difficult to coordinate the official sealing,
thus causing obstruction to the government office's religious sect inspection.

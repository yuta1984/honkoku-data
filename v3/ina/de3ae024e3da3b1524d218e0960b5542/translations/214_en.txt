Regarding old gold and silver coins, although they are being
gradually exchanged for new gold and silver,
there appears to be a considerable amount still remaining.
Since the exchange offices will soon be
closed, which would cause inconvenience,
old gold and silver coins as well as
ni-shu ban should be diligently exchanged
right now. If anyone is found to be
hoarding them without exchanging,
the old gold and silver will be confiscated
and severe punishment will be imposed.
Therefore, magistrates, domain lords, and local lords should
thoroughly investigate, and for remote regions,
overseas territories, and other places where exchange is inconvenient,
they should especially provide assistance
and arrange for coins to be sent to the nearest
exchange office for conversion.

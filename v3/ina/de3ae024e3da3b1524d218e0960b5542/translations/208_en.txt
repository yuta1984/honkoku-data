The aforementioned person also today at
the funeral procession, committed improper acts
and despite the advance guard's strict
admonishment, completely failed to comply.
Even when questioned previously, his manner of response was
repeatedly insolent and extremely inappropriate, so there were
matters that should have been dealt with severely, but
with special consideration, imprisonment is
ordered, and he shall remain under strict confinement.

Please convey the above matter in the presence
of all concerned parties. Above

　4th day of the 5th month
　To Lord Takada Rokuemon
　To the scribes

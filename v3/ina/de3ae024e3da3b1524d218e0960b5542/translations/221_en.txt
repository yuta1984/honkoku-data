When it was ordered that inspections should be received from the contractors,
improper circumstances came to light, and
upon conducting an inspection, it appears that both parties had
misunderstandings, so the town officials

made detailed inquiries and found that there were complete misunderstandings,
which they reported. Since warnings had already been given
previously, they should have followed those instructions, but
their negligent handling of the matter was extremely
inappropriate. Therefore, while there are matters that should be addressed,
since both parties had
miscommunications and such,
especially given the current circumstances, and considering all aspects particularly,
all parties have been severely reprimanded. Henceforth,
both the hemp cloth inspectors and the merchants
must be strictly mindful of their duties.
The above instructions should be conveyed
with all parties present. That is all.

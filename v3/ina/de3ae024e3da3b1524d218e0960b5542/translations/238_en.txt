We have completed our duties including paying respects to both honorable lords.
In the 9th month of Bunka 9 (1812), year of the monkey, we report through a person identification document: A man named Kajihei from Kanaya-machi, Kumamoto in Higo Province was employed as an attendant to Shunjūrō of Itoya in Komeya-machi, Kumamoto in the same province on the 9th day of the 6th month of the same year. While staying in Kiyamachi Nijō sagaru ni-chōme in Kyoto, he wounded the said person and fled. Shunjūrō died from his injuries, but on the 15th day of the 1st month of this year, in Shimoyokobeta village, Mashiki district, Higo Province, Shunjūrō's son Heizaemon took revenge for his father by killing the aforementioned Kajihei. Therefore, there is no need to continue searching for him, but this matter should be announced to all relevant parties.

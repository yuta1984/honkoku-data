Regarding itinerant medicine sellers from other places
who have been coming into the domain territory
for business in recent years, this is to relieve suffering from illness.
Among them are those with sincere intentions and
deep devotion who make their rounds,
which is indeed commendable.
In the rural areas within the domain, especially in remote
locations, when there are sick people,
they may gradually relieve urgent hardships
and save lives through medicine treatment.
Therefore, medicine sellers who come should
conduct business openly without concealment.
Regarding this, since medicines are
precious items that cannot be taken lightly, they must not use counterfeit
medicines or similar fake drugs. From now on,
they should examine carefully and prepare medicines
with great care, and should not engage in forced sales.
Medicine sellers should not prepare medicines
for anyone without a waist tag (license).

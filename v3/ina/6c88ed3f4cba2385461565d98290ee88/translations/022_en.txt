I have received notification that I have been elected to the prefectural assembly,
which is an honor beyond what I deserve in my old age, and I should humbly accept this position, however,
due to my advanced age, having already passed sixty, my body does not function as I wish, and consequently I feel
mental weakness, and in addition, the dizziness that has been
a chronic condition since my youth occasionally manifests, my energy is particularly weak, I am prone to
forgetfulness with poor memory, and recently even small matters have become
difficult to bear at times, and my chronic hernia pain is gradually increasing,
making both lying down and rising uncomfortable, and moreover, since early this month naturally
a certain affliction has developed in my mouth, and my originally poor speaking
ability is increasingly impeding my voice, making even ordinary conversation somehow
difficult. While I believe this is entirely the natural consequence of old age,
I secretly worry that it might be symptoms of apoplexy and am taking preventive measures

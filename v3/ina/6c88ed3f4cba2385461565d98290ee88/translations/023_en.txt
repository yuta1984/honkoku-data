I have been doing so, but there has been no significant improvement yet. While I have been taking nutritional supplements with great care,
unexpectedly receiving this election as an assemblyman has truly left me perplexed about accepting it.
Even if I were to ignore my inadequate condition and force myself to attend the prefectural assembly,
as a representative of the people, if I were to fail in my precious responsibilities and
disappoint the expectations of the masses, this would be inevitable. I deeply feel pain and fear about this.
Therefore, please take pity on the circumstances I have described above,
and with special consideration, please relieve me of my position as prefectural assemblyman so that I may quietly receive medical
treatment. I humbly and earnestly request this. The above.

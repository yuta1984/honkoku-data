　　　Regarding the Consultation on the Location of Kami-Ina County Office

Main Purpose of Consulting on the Location of Kami-Ina County Office:
To determine the location of the county office, two considerations must be taken into account: the convenience or inconvenience for the governed people, and the advantages and disadvantages for administration. Takato, being the former seat of domain administration and standing as the premier town of this county, cannot be considered a perfect location because it is not geographically central. Ina Village, though occupying a relatively central position, lacks impressive urban development and is not suitable as the center of this county, thus it too cannot be considered perfect. Ultimately, what is convenient for one side proves inconvenient for the other, and what is gained on one side is lost on the other - this difficulty cannot be avoided. This is why the location is temporarily designated as provisional. While the final decision naturally lies within the authority of the prefectural government and is not something for towns and villages to decide, we seek to broadly gather opinions from towns and villages and use the direction of public discussion as reference for the decision. Each representative should thoroughly understand this purpose and present any recommendations they may have.

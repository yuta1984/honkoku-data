Application for Handling Transportation Services by Naigai Yōtatsu Company

Regarding myself, on July 15, 1876 (Meiji 9), I entered into an alliance contract with Naigai Yōtatsu Company located at 1 Takegawa-chō, Kyōbashi Ward, Tokyo. I made a transportation contract with the company's representative office in Kamisuwa in this province and commenced business in this village. At that time, the Kamisuwa representative office completed the necessary notification, and I have been conducting transportation services until now. On this occasion, I would like to handle the transportation of various goods through the same procedures. I am submitting copies of the relevant documents as attachments and respectfully request your permission for this matter. Above.

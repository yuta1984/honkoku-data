Document No. 351
Regarding the situation in your district where (Shiozawa Ihachiro of Minaminuki Village and Miyashita Gonshiro of Iijima Village) are brewing snake wine called "Yomeishu" (tonic wine): They previously applied for a license certificate under the assumption that it was similar to patent medicine, but since this does not fall under patent medicine but rather under branded alcoholic beverages, they should apply for a branded alcohol brewing license certificate. Please convey this matter to them. The brewing method documentation and detailed quantities should be submitted and circulated. However, since the deadline is short this year, if they do not sell at the brewing site, they may submit their application in the coming October at their discretion. Please inform them accordingly.

A Written Pledge Respectfully Submitted

Item: Regarding the stonecutters in our village, we have investigated all without exception and submitted this report. There are no others besides these. Furthermore, when going out to work as stonecutters, they shall not take on stonecutter apprentices while traveling. Moreover, we have thoroughly instructed them to carefully investigate the actual conditions of their business destinations, and they have acknowledged and understood each point. Should there be any negligence beyond this point that comes to your attention later, we will immediately report it to you. Furthermore, no matter what punishment you may impose upon us, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. This jointly signed pledge is for future reference.

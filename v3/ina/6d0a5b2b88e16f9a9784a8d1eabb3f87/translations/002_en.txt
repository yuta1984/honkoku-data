Document of Agreement Submitted

Item: Last year in the year of the Horse, when a new road was constructed for the shrine grounds, part of our residential land was also made into a road. As compensation land, we have gratefully received the transfer of land that you have previously owned and managed - consisting of lower fields totaling 2 tan and 28 bu (1 tan 18 bu and 1 tan 10 bu) located on the famous stage area adjacent to our residence, along with a rental house built on said fields (with a front width of 5.5 ken and depth of 2.5 ken).

Given this transfer, we shall take responsibility for the annual rice tax and various duties. Naturally, one of the rental houses has been provided rent-free, and you have previously stationed one cleaning person there to perform cleaning duties. Now that this has been transferred to us, we shall house this cleaning person rent-free in our rental property and ensure that the cleaning duties continue to be performed properly and without negligence for perpetuity, exactly as before.

Regarding the stone retaining walls on three sides of the property: we shall maintain the eastern side ourselves, while the western and southern sides shall be maintained through town public works. Having reached this agreement, neither party shall deviate from these terms. Recorded thus for future reference.

Even if they appear (as allies) today, it would not be unusual for them to become enemies tomorrow. Regarding the fact that people are now forming alliances (against me), how could Ieyasu harbor resentment? If Ieyasu should achieve victory in battle, when these people come to pay their respects afterward, the friendship we have shared until now should not be forgotten. You should carefully consider returning to Osaka from here," he declared. While the other lords had not yet expressed their intentions, Masanori alone stepped forward (and spoke).

Regarding the uprising of forces in the Kamigata region, according to rumors reaching us, the magistrates of Osaka are said to be mobilizing the military forces of the realm under orders from Hideyori. However, Lord Hideyori is merely eight years old - how could such grand designs be his? This must entirely be Mitsunari's scheming to (disturb) the realm, which must not be tolerated. Whatever the hearts of other men may hold, as for Masanori, I shall serve the Kanto side and destroy these treacherous rebels," he declared. Not one of the assembled daimyo dissented, and all followed Masanori's proposal. Lord Tokugawa's joy knew no bounds.

Masanori then led the vanguard along the Tokaido route, destroyed the castles of Takafuchi and Takenohana in Mino Province, captured Gifu Castle, fought at Sekigahara where he destroyed many enemies, and brought about the surrender of the Mori and Shimazu clans, thus bringing the entire realm under Tokugawa rule - Masanori's achievements were immense. However, this man had a fierce temperament and violent behavior, taking human lives as if killing insects without a thought, and perhaps due to his achievements in this campaign (he became arrogant).

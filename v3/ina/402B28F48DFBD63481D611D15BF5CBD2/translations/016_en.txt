He was given departure gifts. [Marginal note: A sword by Mitsutada, three hundred pieces of gold] On this day, Hideaki sent Nagasaki Izunokami as an envoy to Lord Tokugawa, saying "How could I ever forget this gracious favor? There will surely come a time when I can repay you."

[Marginal note: The full details of the matter of Hideaki nearly being transferred to Echizen are detailed in Ōkōchi Hidemitsu's Korean Chronicles. Perhaps people don't know the detailed facts, as there are many different accounts. Here I have followed Ōkōchi's account entirely.]

The Taikō passed away, and in the autumn of the same fifth year, when Lord Tokugawa departed for the campaign against the Uesugi in the northern provinces, Hideaki also hastily gathered troops and departed from his home province to go north. The Osaka forces rose again and summoned troops from various provinces. Hideaki thought this was the time to repay Lord Tokugawa's gracious favor, so he planned to have his brother-in-law Kinoshita Uemon-no-dayū Nobutoshi hold Himeji Castle in Harima Province and wait for the eastern forces to attack. He sent this message to the Kantō region through Yamaoka Bizen-nyūdō Dōami, but his brother-in-law Nobutoshi absolutely refused to lend the castle. Hideaki became greatly angry and quarreled with Nobutoshi, then went to Osaka, proceeded to Kōriyama, and reported to Mandokoro, saying "Hideaki intends to serve Lord Naifu."

Mandokoro listened and said "I hear that the Osaka forces will attack Fushimi Castle. Your brother, the Minister [Marginal note: This refers to Katsutoshi, also called Kinoshita no Toshiko Chōshō - the details about this person are well-known] is in that castle with Naifu's forces. If you also join the Osaka forces in attacking that castle, it would be shameful for me to enter that castle and have brothers fight each other

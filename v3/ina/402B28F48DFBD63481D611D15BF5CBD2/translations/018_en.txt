He sent Hiraoka's younger brother, Dewa-no-kami, as a hostage to Kuroda, along with two messengers, Kamiki Seibei-no-jō and Saitō Yoemon, to the Kantō region. Saying "This is as far as we should go," he finally departed from Osaka. Spending more days on the road, when he heard that Lord Tokugawa had already entered Owari Province, he reached Matsuo Mountain before Sekigahara and set up camp. On September 15th, when he saw the eastern and western armies beginning battle, he attacked the western forces from behind. As a result, the enemy could not defend both front and rear and were immediately defeated. After the battle ended, when he visited Lord Tokugawa's camp, his joy was extraordinary. Hideaki also requested to lead the vanguard against Sawayama, and on the 17th of the same month, he conquered this place as well, and all of Ishida's clan were executed.

In the eleventh month of that year, rewards were distributed, and Hideaki was granted the three provinces of Bizen, Bitchū, and Mimasaka (ruling 720,000 koku. His original domain was said to be 336,040 koku). Not long after, on July 18th of Keichō 6 (1601), Hideaki died young at the age of twenty-three. Since he had no heir, his house was abolished.

The mother and child [Hideyori and his mother] gave no response and [the messenger] rushed back to the Kantō. On the eleventh day of the eleventh month, the Shōgun entered the capital, and it was heard that Kuroda Chikuzen-no-kami Nagamasa and Katō Samanosuke Yoshiaki were also detained in the Kantō like Masanori. On the twenty-ninth of the same month, Bingo-no-kami Masakatsu, together with Shigetoshi, led military forces and rushed to Osaka, presenting a letter of safe passage given by the Toyotomi house to Masakatsu and besieged the castle. (At this time, I have seen letters that Masanori sent to his retainers. This person appeared to be well-versed in military affairs.)

His son Bingo-no-kami Masakatsu was also moved like his father

Using Utsuki-ga-take Valley River as the boundary, the northeastern area shall extend through to the Kurokawa Mountain ridge, and both sides' five villages may have joint access rights (iriai). The boundary of Kurokawa Mountain shall be the water drop point along the Kitago-sho ridge as the border, with the southwest being Kitago-sho and the northeast being designated as Kurokawa Mountain on both the left and right sides of the river.

Continuing to the right mountain, Kaho-Akasu claims it as Dainichi-muko Mountain with joint access rights, while Miyata calls it Kimyo Mountain, claiming it belongs to the farmers. An investigation was ordered regarding this disputed location.

However, this does not correspond with the land survey register (kenchi-cho) that Miyata Village claims. Moreover, the firewood huts placed there belong to the farmers of Kaho-Akasu, and they have also built temporary bridges with reliable account books for repair expenses. Based on this, joint access rights were decided, allowing the harvesting of grass and firewood before the written conditions.

Furthermore, while the land survey register that Miyata claims has attached deletion marks for mountain locations, the certificate from the Senior Councilors when the private domain was transferred records "three locations in Miyata Village," and upon inspection, there are no other such places. Therefore, from the valley river flowing from Koma-ga-take northeastward to the Kurokawa Mountain ridge boundary, Miyata Village shall be designated as the local authority.

Additionally, since the disputed mountains called Dainichi-muko Mountain and Kimyo Mountain are geographically continuous, Miyata shall also be designated as the local authority for these. From the aforementioned valley river south to Utsuki-ga-take Valley River, being geographically continuous, Kaho Village shall be designated as the local authority.

However, regarding joint access rights, without discrimination against the local [illegible text], all five villages may have joint access to these locations. Particularly, the matter of placing logging huts and firewood huts shall remain as before without any changes.

Next, future timber cutting in the mountain areas shall follow previous precedents. However, Chison Heiemon and the territorial lord shall agree that the mountain contractor's term shall be limited to three years, with mountain access determined by establishing a rotation system through drawing lots.

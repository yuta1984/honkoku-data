I write to inform you by letter. Though it is now the cold season, I trust you are in good health, which is most gratifying. Now then, recently there has been correspondence from Sakuemon in Shimakamijo Village in Koshu Province regarding religious matters. He requests that "one of you two gentlemen please safekeep the religious seal," and since he has sent the seal to me, I am keeping it in custody. Regarding this matter, I have been asked to make this request of you. I would appreciate it if either of you two could handle this matter favorably. I wanted to inform you of this matter, so I write in haste. The above.

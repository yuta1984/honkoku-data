One: The abandoned child taken in by Ikeya Ishichi of the lower town became ill around the seventh month, and on the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month developed a serious illness. A report was made and we submitted this to the magistrate's office. However, when we reported that the child died on the twenty-seventh day of the same month, we were given instructions to submit a formal petition, which is as follows:

　　　We humbly submit this formal report
　Regarding the abandoned female child whom we have been
　caring for since the twenty-seventh day of the seventh month
　of Kōka 3, Year of the Fire Horse: she became ill in late seventh month.
　As documented in the separate child-rearing records, we provided
　medical treatment for the abandoned child,
　but ultimately her recovery was not possible, and on the twenty-seventh day
　of this month at dawn, around the hour of the Rabbit, she died of illness.
　We hereby report this matter. That is all.

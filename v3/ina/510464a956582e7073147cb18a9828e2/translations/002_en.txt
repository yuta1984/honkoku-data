Regarding the matter of this written pledge submitted:

Item: Concerning the stone cutters of our village, we have investigated and recorded every person in the village without exception, and there is not even one person [engaged in stone cutting]. Those who go out to work as stone cutters shall not take on stone cutting apprentices while traveling. Furthermore, we have instructed them in detail to observe the actual conditions of their business destinations, and they have expressed understanding and accepted these instructions. Should there be any matters of inadequate investigation beyond this point, and should you hear of them later, please promptly report from your end. Even if any punishment is imposed upon us thereafter, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. This jointly sealed pledge is for future reference, therefore as stated above.

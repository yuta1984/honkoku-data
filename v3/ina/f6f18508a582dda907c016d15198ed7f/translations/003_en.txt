On the 24th, he brought 200 ryō which we received and held in trust. On the night of the 26th, we held a meeting, drew up the formal contract, and had it sealed by four town representatives and rural parishioners: Shōzaemon and Kihei from Matoba Village, and Mozaemon from Miroku Village. The matter was settled and everyone departed. At that time, the head priest mentioned that through Shōzaemon's mediation, there was also someone willing to donate a storehouse measuring 3×5 ken in addition to the 200 ryō. When asked who the purchaser would be,

since no decision was made on this matter at all, the current head priest wishes to consult with Shōzaemon about providing additional payment to Iwatarō. Subsequently, circular notices were sent around and Iwatarō was sternly told to relocate. Therefore, we humbly submit this petition and deeply apologize for troubling you. Regarding this land matter, we do not understand the official directives from the Tenpō period, and we deeply regret having conducted private negotiations for the sale according to the current head priest's wishes alone. We now humbly request your compassion in allowing us to lease the property for ground rent, and ask that you provide thorough explanation to both parties. Other matters will be explained orally when inquired.

With the above circumstances, if you would mercifully grant our petition as submitted, we would all consider it a most grateful blessing. The above.

Memorandum of Oral Statement

Regarding the matter of Mankōji Temple's Nakamachi estate land, on the 21st day of the eighth month last year, all parishioners deliberated and decided on the consultation to sell it to Sakaiya Iwatarō. Therefore, we signed the main deed of transfer as representatives. Subsequently, according to the head priest's wishes, we unavoidably sent a cancellation document to Iwatarō's side with seven people. Regarding this matter, a petition has been submitted by Iwatarō, which we deeply regret.

The reason we did not affix our seals to the document submitted this time by the other parishioner representatives is that the aforementioned representative signing exists, which causes us concern. We are also embarrassed by our unfamiliarity with the precedents from the Tenpō era.

We humbly request that the matter be left as is with the payment for the said estate land.

　　Humbly submitting this oral petition
One: I am an incompetent person, but I have been appointed to the position of town representative (machi-dai), which I have gratefully undertaken. However, in recent years I have become sickly and find it difficult to perform my duties. Therefore, I petition for exemption from the position of town representative.

Regarding the above matter, if you would mercifully command as I have petitioned, it would be most grateful. That is all.

I have gradually fallen into poverty and find it difficult to continue my livelihood, therefore I wish to move myself and my daughter to the area in front of Kenpuku Temple. Accordingly, I petition that we may be admitted to that temple's religious congregation.
Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously grant this petition as requested, it would be most gratefully received. That is all.

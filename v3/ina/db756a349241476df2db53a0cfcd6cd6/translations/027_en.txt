　Respectfully submitting this oral petition
I am an incompetent person, but unexpectedly in the past Bunka 11th Inu year,
I was granted permission to wear swords, and furthermore received stipend payments and was appointed to government craft work.
This is extremely fortunate, repeatedly grateful circumstances that I deeply appreciate. Therefore, I had wished to serve diligently
with dedication, but in recent years my financial situation has become difficult, and at this time I have become extremely
impoverished, unable to maintain my household and finding it difficult to continue my service. Therefore, respectfully,
having no choice, I submit my craft tools and request to be released from government craft work.
Regarding the above matter, if through your mercy you would grant my petition as requested,
it would be most grateful circumstances. The above stated.　　　Hokimachi-machi Petitioner

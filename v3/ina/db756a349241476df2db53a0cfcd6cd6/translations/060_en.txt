Humbly, I respectfully petition through this oral statement:
I petitioned against Kurokawachi <<strikethrough: Jinuemon-dono | Rōsen-sama>>, and regarding the money dispute case
currently under your investigation, as shown in the attached settlement certificate, mediators intervened
and both parties reached agreement through private settlement negotiations, which I consider entirely due to your authority and a most grateful
blessing. Therefore, I petition that you dismiss the case.
Regarding this matter, if you would graciously grant my request
as petitioned through your compassion, it would be a most grateful blessing. The above　Hokomotimachi Suginoya

　Submitted certificate of settlement for money dispute
Hokomotimachi Suginoya Chōzaemon's wife brought suit against Kurokawachi Jinuemon-dono regarding
the overdue principal and interest of support money for dependents, causing hardship. I shall explain the circumstances.
In Bunka 12, Year of the Boar, Chōzaemon suffered from illness and mental disorder, making it impossible to continue his sake brewing business.
Due to particularly severe illness, from the onset of the disease, prayers and religious rituals required considerable expenses, and private borrowing,
not to mention official loans, accumulated. Moreover, with many dependents including elderly and infants of the current year,
it became absolutely impossible to manage. Therefore, Jinuemon-dono's father Rōsen-sama, with sincere intentions,
provided extraordinary assistance. Entrusting ourselves to this, we sold household goods and miscellaneous items, and naturally
received advance payments for the support of mother, patients, and children. However, in Bunsei 4, Year of the Snake,
due to unavoidable circumstances, we received an advance of twenty ryō, leaving forty ryō on deposit, but
for whatever reason, since the Year of the Horse, there has been a discrepancy with the original intentions

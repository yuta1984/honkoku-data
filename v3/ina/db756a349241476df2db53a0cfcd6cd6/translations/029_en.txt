Respectfully, I humbly submit this oral petition.

As I have grown old and infirm and have no male heir, I have an informal relationship with a man named Mokubei, the younger brother of Genbei from Akasu village under the jurisdiction of Yamada Mozaemon-sama. Therefore, I wish to adopt him as my heir for succession, and have privately consulted about this matter, so I humbly submit this petition.

Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously grant my petition as requested, it would be most gratefully received.

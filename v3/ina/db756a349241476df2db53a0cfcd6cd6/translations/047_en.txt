Humbly submitting this oral statement as a petition
One　Although I am an incompetent person, I was appointed to the honorable position of
　　town representative, which I considered most gratifying, and have been serving in this capacity. However,
　　in recent years I have become sickly and find it difficult to continue serving. Therefore,
　　I petition that you grant me exemption from the honorable position of
　　town representative. Above
Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously grant this petition as requested,
it would be most gratifying. Above

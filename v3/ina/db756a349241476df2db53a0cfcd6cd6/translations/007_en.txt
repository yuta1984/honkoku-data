Humbly submitting a petition in writing
1. I have been an apprentice to the blacksmith Eizo of Hokomochi-machi until now,
having learned the trade and completed my term of apprenticeship. From this year,
I wish to serve as a water official (mizuyaku) and practice blacksmithing in the same town.
I humbly request that you graciously grant me the water official's license
as petitioned. If granted, it would be most grateful and fortunate.

If granted as requested, we all together
would consider it most grateful and fortunate. The above, same town

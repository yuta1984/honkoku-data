I have been training one Taketō from Kamishima Village as an apprentice in the blacksmith trade. His term of service has now ended and I have unavoidably released him. Henceforth, he wishes to become independent, serve as a water official (mizuyaku), and practice his trade, for which I humbly petition. I would be most grateful if you would graciously approve this petition as requested. Dentō (seal)

The aforementioned Denjū's petition is entirely accurate without any discrepancy. I would be most grateful if you would graciously approve this request, and we would all consider it a great fortune.

Respectfully submitted as a written petition

Regarding the petition submitted by Shinhichi of Kokoya (grain shop) on Yoko-machi: He has been conducting charcoal business until now, but in recent years his business has not been going well and he wishes to cease the charcoal trade. Therefore, I would like to take over this business and sell charcoal in the castle town and other locations. I humbly request that you grant passage through the charcoal inspection stations at Hokomochiguchi and Shimahataguchi, and I wish to submit the required quantities and taxes to the inspection stations. Therefore I humbly petition.

I would be most grateful if you would graciously grant my petition as requested. That is all.

Respectfully submitted as a written petition

The succession of Fujisawaya Banemon has been interrupted for some time, but since there are proper lineage connections, I wish to send my younger brother Eizō as an adopted son to continue the family name. Therefore I humbly petition.

I would be most grateful if you would graciously grant my petition as requested. That is all.

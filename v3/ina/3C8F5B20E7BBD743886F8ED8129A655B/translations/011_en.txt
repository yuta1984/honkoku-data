1. What Senior Inspector Kuwahara Yoshū conveyed was that regarding today's iro-naoshi ceremony,
　　Lord Izumi-no-kami and Lord Uneme-no-shō received bestowed items, which was reported
　　to His Lordship and heard. Regarding this, I was to send out written messages and circulars
　　After consulting and discussing with Lord Suō, I sent them out after returning home. This is recorded at the end.

1. After that, I withdrew and arranged for senior and junior officials' rounds to be announced to the entrance attendant
　　The verbal message was "I am calling to offer congratulations for today's celebration and to express gratitude"
　　Both senior and junior officials had the same verbal message. Moreover, when I consulted with
　　Duty ceremony announcer Lord Inaba Tango, he informed me that
　　The ceremony announcers had also agreed and decided on the verbal message for their rounds
　　So the same-rank officials who attended today all agreed and handled it with the same verbal message
　　I returned home around 8:30, about two-tenths past.

1. The letter sent from my consultation partner Lord Suō, along with a copy of the separate official document
　　Is as follows. After reviewing it, I sent an acknowledgment reply:
　　　　To Lord Toda Inaba-no-kami　　　　Makino Suō-no-kami
　　　I respectfully write this letter. As we discussed earlier
　　　In the palace, since it was given to Lord Toda Uneme-no-shō,
　　　I am sending a copy of the official document conveyed by Kuwahara Yoshū to the current
　　　Duty officials via circular under both your and my names
　　　To Lord Mizuno Dewa, I am sending a letter under both your and my names
　　　To those who are ill, young, or in their domains, I am ordering subordinate circulars to be sent
　　　I am forwarding a copy of said official document. Please retain it.
　　　This is to obtain your understanding of the above matter. That is all.
　　　　November 15th
　　　Copy of official document given to Lord Toda Uneme-no-shō
　　　　To Senior Inspector
　　　On the coming 15th, for the iro-naoshi celebration, the tsumenoshu, hereditary retainers,
　　　Their heirs, attendants, ceremony announcers, and their heirs in the Kiku-no-ma

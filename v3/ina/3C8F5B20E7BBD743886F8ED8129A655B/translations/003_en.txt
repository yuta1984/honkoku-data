The Ōmetsuke Kuwabara Yoshū, who was present, conveyed the message and also showed the official document. This was because today
on the duty day, a circular notice was issued by Lord Suō in joint names of myself and Lord Suō. Although brief, it was appropriate, and we received soup and
sake, and there was also an official document regarding rotation duties.
One: There was a summons from the metsuke, so I went to the Kari-no-ma (Wild Geese Room)
　　Following the custom of receiving the ceremonial bird, the heir of the main seat in Kiku-no-ma (Chrysanthemum Room), seated facing the seated sōshaban,
　　sat next to his colleagues, and those in the same location's side seating sat next to the sōshaban. Soup was served with
　　two kinds of side dishes on the tray, earthenware vessels were also brought out and received. Two rounds of sake were passed, and the senior councillors came to offer greetings.
　　At that time, Lord Echizen-no-kami from the upper seat said to partake leisurely, and Lord Dewa from the upper seat of the colleagues expressed gratitude, then the senior councillors withdrew to the inner rooms. Another round of sake was passed, and the tray with sake vessels
　　was also cleared. No formal thanks were given to the captains, and directly as on January 11th, the senior councillors took their seats in Fuyō-no-ma (Lotus Room),
　　the tamari-zume came out to offer formal greetings, then the hereditary retainers came out and concluded, and in replacement,
　　three from the upper colleagues, also the duty officer from the sōshaban side, then two more in hierarchical order.

　　A total of three people. We also followed after the sōshaban, at the main seat of Kiku-no-ma, with the heirs at the same location's side
　　seating, all the heirs came out together, and Lord Dewa from the upper seat expressed gratitude for receiving the soup and sake,
　　and it concluded. Particularly while Lord Echizen-no-kami was seated in the upper position on the narrow corridor side of Fuyō-no-ma,
　　facing that direction was Lord Dewa from the upper seat of colleagues, and then those from the same location's side seating became the lower seats.

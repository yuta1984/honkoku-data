One: Ōmetsuke Kuwabara Yoshū conveyed that regarding today's iro-naoshi ceremony, Lord Izumi-no-kami and Lord Uneme-no-shō
　　received bestowed items, which was announced as official notification. Regarding this, I was to send out
　　a subordinate letter and circular notice, which I discussed with Lord Suō and sent out after returning home. This is
　　recorded at the end.
One: After that, I withdrew and left instructions with the entrance attendant regarding the rotation duties of senior and junior officials. The standard greeting was "I have come to pay respects for today's celebration
　　and to express gratitude." The greeting format was the same for both senior and junior officials. I consulted with the duty sōshaban
　　Lord Inaba Tango-no-kami, who informed me that the sōshaban had also agreed on the standard greeting for rotation duties.
　　Therefore, all the colleagues who came out today agreed and handled it with this greeting format.
　　I returned home at two sun past the half of the eighth hour.
One: The letter sent from Lord Suō who was on duty, along with a copy of the separate official document, is as follows. After reviewing,
　　I sent a reply of acknowledgment.

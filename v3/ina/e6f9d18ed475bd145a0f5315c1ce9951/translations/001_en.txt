Document of Submission

Regarding the matter of stonecutters in our village, we have thoroughly investigated and found that there are no stonecutters other than those reported this year. We understand that stonecutting work while traveling should be conducted with utmost honesty and propriety. Should you hear of any cases where we have excluded or concealed anyone from the records, we acknowledge that you will report this matter to the authorities. Furthermore, whatever punishment we may receive for this, we shall harbor no resentment whatsoever. This serves as a stonecutting contractor's certificate for future reference. Respectfully submitted.

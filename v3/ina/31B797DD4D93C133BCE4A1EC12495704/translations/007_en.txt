Verbal Communication　　　　　From Danjō-shōhitsu

I congratulate you on your good health. Regarding the copy of the retinue procession arrangements we discussed earlier, I have prepared it for circulation. Please promptly circulate it to the two gentlemen other than Lord Yamato.

Although the arrangements have not yet been definitively settled, since Lord Echizen made inquiries today about this matter, I am sending this promptly for your information. I will meet with you in person to discuss this further. The above.

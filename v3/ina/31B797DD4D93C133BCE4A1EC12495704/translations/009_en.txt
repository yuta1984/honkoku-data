Regarding the retinue arrangements for officials of the same rank with approximately 10,000 koku or more, while practices vary at present, previously those appointed from among the tsumeshu (attending officials) served directly with their traditional retinues. This was not a matter of individual family status, but because the tsumeshu belonged to the gokatte (financial department) and held positions that could even change to gososhabanin during New Year, kajō, and gencho ceremonies. The retinues corresponded to those positions. Those appointed from among the gofudai (hereditary vassals) and tozama (outside lords), in all cases, first prepare carrying boxes, box cords, palanquins, sun covers, umbrella bags, and similar items.

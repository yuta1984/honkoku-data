Article: Inquiry regarding the method of distributing payment for labor costs for various post stations on highways and relay services in villages

Since the fourth month of Kanoe-Uma [1870], following the reform of the post station laws on various highways, official correspondence and official goods dispatched from this bureau and various departments to their outposts have been relayed by both post stations and villages through payment of wages and various expenses, and for those with confirmed evidence, the distribution of such payments should be investigated using return labor registers. However, for relay services over long distances and in large numbers,

these registers naturally become damaged, or receipt slips on scraps of paper are frequently lost en route. Moreover, on secondary routes and in remote villages, not only are relay distances and wages often not recorded, but in extreme cases, even village names are not written down, making thorough investigation difficult to achieve. Therefore, within the jurisdiction of the aforementioned areas, we wish to urgently investigate and submit reports using the format of the attached model forms, and also for future cases, to investigate within one month limits and have both post stations and villages submit directly to this bureau. Accordingly, we hereby submit this inquiry along with draft request forms from prefectures and attached model forms.

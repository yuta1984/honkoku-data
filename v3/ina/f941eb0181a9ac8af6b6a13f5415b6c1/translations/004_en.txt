Internal: 2 monme 3 bu in gold    Listed in the accounting ledger
        150 mon in coins         as disbursed amount

Regarding the above, the village officials state that during the four years from Tenpō 9 when Tōzaemon served as village headman, an investigation was conducted into the portion of Myōkōji Temple's excess rice that resulted in losses, and this became documented in certificates. While 2 ryō 3 bu in gold and 150 mon in coins were entered into Myōkōji Temple's accounting ledger, these do not match with the certificates, and moreover, the original ledgers have not been submitted.

Furthermore, they state that there were also loans to other parties, and during Tōzaemon's term of office, collection certificates were returned. Since his own portion was also completed and he holds certificates from deputy Hanemon, these should be returned, but they remain as they were and continue to exist. While Tōzaemon's side claims to have sent a complete set of Myōkōji Temple ledgers, these do not exist. The ledgers were not received. With these circumstances and no collection ledgers available, there are concerns about the previous disbursements as well. Since a proper investigation cannot be conducted, we are troubled by this matter.

The above is what the village officials have stated. End.

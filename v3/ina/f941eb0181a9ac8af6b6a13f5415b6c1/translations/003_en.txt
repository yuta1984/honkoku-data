The village officials stated that if we lend this to the hōin (Buddhist priest), 
we should also discuss it with other officials as appropriate. If we lend 
according to the priest's request and he takes a full share using the temple's rice, 
Myōkōji Temple will not be able to sustain itself. Furthermore, 
the completion certificates for five years were submitted together.
Although it was said that payments would be made annually to the priest,
after the priest departed, there were no completion certificates from the temples
and it became without a resident priest. While these should have been 
submitted to the caretakers, this was not done either. This time
five documents were submitted for completion. Until such time as 
a priest may come in the future, we have arranged for 
Tōzaemon to provide and hold the aforementioned rice.

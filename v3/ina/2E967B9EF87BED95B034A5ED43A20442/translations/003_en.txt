Regarding the matter of humbly submitting a written petition with utmost reverence

Concerning my sake brewing equipment and residential property that I possess, Iseya Zensuke has submitted a petition with various falsehoods. His claims about lands that have become wasteland after the term expired, and sake brewing licenses that have fallen into disuse, along with his skillful arguments to easily make these his own property, are truly outrageous matters, I believe.

For several decades since my father's time, we have received gracious favors from the Gongensho, and with sincere gratitude and understanding, what we have continued until now is due to the weighty and grateful benevolence, which we consider most fortunate. As stated in the separate reply document, although Zensuke and his relatives conspire to manipulate this matter, I deeply entreat that through your wise consideration and mercy, my livelihood may be sustained through your compassion, which I petition for repeatedly. The above.

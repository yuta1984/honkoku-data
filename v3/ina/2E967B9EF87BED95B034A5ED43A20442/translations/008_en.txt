Along with upper field of 5 tan 2 bu, lower field of 4 tan bu, upper field of 24 bu, another 18 bu, and water mill observation area of 7 bu, totaling five parcels, for which 20 ryō was paid as礼金 (gratitude money). The total sum of 50 ryō was paid, and a transfer certificate was kept for an 8-year term from the year of the boar to the year of the monkey. Afterward, it became difficult to continue the sake brewing business, so we discussed renting it to Yamagataya Kihachi for rent. At that time, the official産物会所 (products office) expressed desire to conduct sake brewing, so we rented it for 15 ryō in rent, and later for 20 ryō. Even after Rokubei's 8-year term expired, there was no notice from him, so similar to the residential land matter, we consulted with Yoshidaya Kanzō, who requested a 5-year extension, which we granted. As with the previous matter, even when the term expired, there was absolutely no notice, so according to the original certificate it became forfeited, and when mortgaging it elsewhere, all official seals presented no obstacles, and we have possessed it until now. Even though the term has passed and we have left it abandoned for already 16-17 years, to bring up various claims at this point is extremely unlawful, I believe.

[Sukehei] attached himself to Ii no Jijū, hastily assembled his forces, and stated that he should follow after [Tokugawa] and rush down. Lord Tokugawa sent a letter expressing his gratitude. At this point, war broke out again in the Kamigata region with the intention of overthrowing Lord Tokugawa. Among the nine provinces, only Kuroda Nyūdō would be an unparalleled ally of the eastern provinces, so Sukehei secretly sent a messenger to the Nyūdō saying, "Sukehei has firmly resolved to side with the eastern provinces, but should he rush back to his home province to fight the enemies of the nine provinces, or should he remain in Osaka and raise troops? He wishes to hear your strategic counsel." Josui Nyūdō replied, "It would not be appropriate for you to assist by raising troops in the Kamigata region.

It would be better for you to quickly go down to your home province and raise troops there." When Sukehei was about to depart saying "Very well then," he suddenly fell ill and was unable to return to his province. His son Sakyō-no-suke Sukeyoshi, who had turned eleven this year, was sent down to the home province with retainers and followers attached to him. The retainers and followers in the province quickly assembled forces and departed from Obi Castle on the last day of the ninth month. (Inatsu Kambu was the general.) They attacked and captured Takahashi Ukon Shōgen's Miyazaki Castle and pressed against Shimazu Nakatsukasa-dayū's Sadowara Castle. Satsuma forces came out in large numbers to provide rear support for Sadowara, and battles were fought here and there, but [the Itō forces] ultimately suffered not a single defeat. They subdued the lands of Mukasa, Kuraoka, Takaoka, Ayaai and others.

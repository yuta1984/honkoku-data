While based in Toda-no-shō in Unshū (Izumo Province), they subjugated the surrounding seven provinces and extended their authority throughout the San'yō and San'in regions. When this happened, they (the Kamei clan) also naturally became retainers of that house (the Amago). During the time of Saemon-no-jō Haruhisa, son of Iyo-no-kami Tsunehisa, Mōri Daizen-dayū Motonari arose in Aki Province and fought with Haruhisa over territory for about seven years.

At some point, his years of military achievements were recognized and he was ordered to receive half of Inaba Province. Korenobu humbly accepted this and said, "Korenobu has no desire for any province within Japan. If I may humbly receive permission, I would like to be granted Ryukyu and subjugate it." The Kampaku then took his own fan and personally wrote "Kamei Ryukyu-no-suke" on it and bestowed it upon him.

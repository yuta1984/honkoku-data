Having taken his head, I leaped into the water and escaped," he reported, and those who heard were greatly impressed. {{Marginal note: There are accounts that say at this time, a mountain priest appeared from nowhere and taught him well about Wada's armor, helmet, horse, and equipment, enabling him to strike him down. That Hidehide thought and planned thus, throwing away his life to strike and escape, was due to his courage, strategy, and skill at swimming.

Since this castle was originally territory ruled by Hidehide, perhaps Nobunaga granted it to him as it originally was.}} He also made his eldest son Tōhyōe-no-jō Hidemasa his son-in-law and granted him Miki Castle in Harima Province as well. In the fifth month of the same tenth year, Hidehide served as vanguard on the San'yōdō road with Akechi, Nagaoka, Ikeda and others, returning to Settsu Province, when on the second day of the sixth month Lord Oda and his son were killed in the capital by Akechi Mitsuhide, and Chikuzen-no-kami Hideyoshi rushed from San'yō, met at Amagasaki, and beginning with Lord Sanshichi...

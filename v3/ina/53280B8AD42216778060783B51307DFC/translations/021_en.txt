Although Masutoki was the eldest son, since he was initially supposed to inherit the house of Yoshichika of Shirakawa and had become an adopted son-in-law, the second son Kiyomasu was made Takamasu's heir. Kiyomasu died on July 25, Tenshō 15 (1587), at the age of twenty-three, and his eldest son Masutoki also died on May 8, Keichō 2 (1597), at the age of thirty-seven. Uemon-no-suke Takamasu, having been preceded in death by his two sons, died on January 14, Keichō 5 (1600), at the age of seventy-two. At this time, his eldest grandson Yahēji Masamasu (son of Tosa-no-kami Masutoki) was still young. It was decided that until he came of age, the family affairs should be handled by the third son, Uemon-no-suke Sukemasu, who was made to inherit the house. In the autumn of the year Takamasu died, Lord Tokugawa was to subjugate the Uesugi of Ōshū, and the vanguard had already reached Utsunomiya in this province, but the main camp was established at Oyama in Shimōsa. When the western forces rose again, Lord Tokugawa and his son turned back and divided into two forces along the mountain and sea routes

to attack, so the people of Nasu defended their home province to fight against the Uesugi. When the western forces were defeated at the Battle of Sekigahara, Uesugi Kagekatsu had no need to fight, and the entire realm was pacified. Since his elder brother Masutoki's son Yahēji Masamasu had already reached fifteen years of age, Sukemasu, following his father's dying wishes, transferred the family affairs to him and died on April 1, Keichō 14 (1609), at the age of thirty-two. Yahēji Masamasu inherited the house and served in the Shogun's vanguard during the Siege of Osaka (the earlier and later campaigns), presenting ninety-seven severed heads. In the following year, on the last day of May, Genna 8 (1622), he died at the age of twenty-six. His eldest son Tosa-no-kami Takamasu (for what reason does he share the same name as his great-grandfather?) succeeded his father and was granted court rank on the last day of December, Kan'ei 7 (1630). His son Uemon Masuchika succeeded his father (the year and month of Takamasu's death are still unknown). He divided territory among his younger brothers (Masuchika received 18,000 koku, second son Shume Masuhide, third son Ukon).

took position at Nojiri. The Itō forces could not endure and Tozaki Castle fell. Most of the remaining military forces in the western provinces were all of Fukunaga's clan, who suddenly shot arrows from behind, so Minbu-dayū Sukemasa, grandson of the Third Rank Lay Monk, was unable to fight and led his clan and retainers in retreat through the mountains from a place called Hokita to Bungo Province, relying on family connections to depend on the Ōtomo and planning to return to his home province. When dawn came in the 6th month of Tenshō 6, Ōtomo Saemon-no-kami Yoshishige, the lay monk Sōrin, led several hundred cavalry toward Hyūga Province, and on the 12th day of the 11th month of the same year fought the Shimazu brothers near the Mimikawa River, lost advantage in one battle, suffered terrible defeat and withdrew. The Itō also now had no one left to rely on, so in the 4th month of the dawning 7th year, they left Bungo Province and crossed to Iyo Province. At this place

they spent three years through spring and autumn. (Upon examination, the records of the Itō house in the Shimazu family genealogy are particularly detailed, so I take that account and record it. However, considering together the Ōtomo Records, Ryūzōji Records, and various records that describe Kyūshū affairs, the Itō loss of Hyūga is placed during the time of the Third Rank Lay Monk. Among these, what is recorded in the Ōtomo Records seems to be detailed, it is said. On the 28th day of the 12th month of Tenshō 4, the Third Rank Lay Monk fled to Bungo Province and relied on Sōrin through Tahara Ōmi-no-nyūdō Shōnin, an unmatched capable man of the Ōtomo. Soon a residence was prepared in Kunisaki District and he was welcomed. At such a time, by some unknown person's doing, a poem "Becoming fleas, lice, and rats, the Third Rank Lord crawls about under Tahara" was written and posted at the Third Rank's house gate, so thinking it shameful, he secretly slipped out of Bungo and crossed to Iyo Province, then again crossed to Suō Province and resided in a place called Yamaguchi, and in the winter of Tenshō 12 proceeded toward the capital, finally dying before others. The Third Rank's younger brother Minbu-dayū Sukemasa served his elder brother's [lord] Toyotomi Taikō and finally had his original territory confirmed, it is said. This account differs greatly from the Shimazu family genealogy. Regarding the satirical writing incident, even when scorning the Third Rank's descendants, one should still address him as "Third Rank Lord." In the Itō genealogy that I saw, the year and month of the Third Rank's death is not shown, so it is difficult to determine either way.) In the 6th month of Tenshō 10, Sukemasa also left Iyo Province and went up toward the capital. In the summer of this year, Lord Oda and his son were [killed] by Akechi Mitsuhide

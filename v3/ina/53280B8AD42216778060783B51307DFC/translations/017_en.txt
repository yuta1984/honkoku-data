He captured five or six castles of various sizes including Kitsuregawa and Washijuku, and wielded his authority over the neighboring areas. In the same year of Tenshō 18 (1590), when Toyotomi Kanpaku launched a campaign to Sagami Province, daimyo from the eastern provinces rushed to join his army in an endless stream. The Nasu clan members and retainers likewise hurried to Odawara. When the Hōjō were already destroyed and [Toyotomi Hideyoshi] was about to proceed to Ōshū, establishing his camp in this province, Sukeharu had his first audience. His Highness was angered by Sukeharu's late arrival and gave away all of the Nasu domain to those clan members and retainers who had arrived earlier (Ōtawara, Ōzeki, Karasuyama, Fukuhara, Warashina, Senpon, etc.), leaving Sukeharu with only the small territory of Fukuhara.

Harutomo adopted a daughter of Mito as his child and had her marry Mikawa-no-kami-dono, passing the house to him. Therefore, Sukeharu was the co-father-in-law of Mikawa-no-kami-dono, and Mikawa-no-kami-dono's children and Sukeharu's children were second cousins, maintaining a close relationship.

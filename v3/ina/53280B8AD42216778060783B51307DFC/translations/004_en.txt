Nanbu　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Hankanfu Volume 9, Part 2

Shinano-no-kami Minamoto no Toshinao was the son of Daizenno-daibu Nobunao, who was a descendant of Nanbu Saburō Mitsuyuki of the Kai Genji, the third son of Shinano-no-kami Tōmitsu (also known as Kagami Jirō), who was the great-grandson of Gyōbujō Yoshimitsu (also known as Shinra Saburō). After Mitsuyuki, generation after generation served as retainers of the Kamakura lord. During the time of his ninth-generation descendant Umanosuke Shigétoki, on the 23rd day of the 5th month of Shōkyō 2, when Sagami-nyūdō Taira no Takátoki perished, [Shigétoki] committed suicide at Kamakura. Shigétoki's son, Iyo-no-kami Nobunaga, and his son, Tōtōmi-no-kami Masayuki, received documents from Ashikaga Takauji and had their original territories confirmed. (These two documents are said to be passed down to their descendants even today.) Masayuki's son, Daizenno-daibu Moriyuki, the lay monk Zenkō, rushed to join the Kamakura lord's side at the very beginning of the Ōei Rebellion and distinguished himself in military service, so Ashikaga Mochiuji's appreciation was profound, and he granted him a document appointing him as governor of Mutsu Province.

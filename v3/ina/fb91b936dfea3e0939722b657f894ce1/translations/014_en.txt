Item: At the government office, both magistrates issued the following orders: Send two men to Matsushima post station to make inquiries, and if any information about the situation becomes known, immediately report it to the office.

Item: Regarding Iida and Suwa, since they are nearby domains, there were instructions to send [messengers] to inform them of our arrangements here. At the very least, written correspondence should be prepared and sent via post station relay.

Year of the Monkey, 12th month, 5th day
From the wholesale dealer of Ichimiya Kimura village to the government office:
Regarding the rice tax inspection official, accounting officer
Horitani Kihei-sama, and two construction officials,
along with one yokome (inspector) official,
totaling about twelve people including servants, who will
arrive and stay at Matsushima inn on the 9th day.
When this matter was reported, it was ordered at the
government office meeting that five representatives from around Matsumoto
should be dispatched to make inquiries.
I humbly accepted this order and returned, then consulted with
my colleagues. Kitaya Denaemon and Tomiya
Shirobei, both men, will
depart early morning tomorrow on the 6th day.
Furthermore, I instructed them to make thorough inquiries
at Matsushima inn and
learn in detail from which direction these officials are coming.

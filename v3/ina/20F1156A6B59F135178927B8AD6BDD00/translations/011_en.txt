　　　Young Lord Takechiya's First Banner Viewing《Marginal note: Decorated helmets 233 | Spears 20 | Firearms》
1. On the ceremonial day, before the formal greetings, the ō-metsuke [senior inspector] handles arrangements, and after the greetings everyone remains.
　　　　However, the ō-metsuke provides instructions. Regarding today's banner viewing, soup and sake are bestowed from the main castle keep and received at the western compound.
1. At the regular seating, formal greetings are offered on the ceremonial day. Assessing the situation, everyone takes their seats, the senior councilors sit in formation, the monthly duty officer makes announcements, and the banner viewing at the western compound is ordered.
　　　　However, through correspondence, gratitude for this fortunate occasion is expressed.
1. Going to the western compound is guided by the ō-metsuke.
1. Regarding the sword attendant and sandal bearer going around: According to the written instructions, how should one proceed if unable to bring them along? When Lord Sanshima-no-kami inquired of Murakami Kenmotsu, he provided guidance that one sword attendant should go around via the outer route to both compounds. Regarding sandal bearers going around, though it is mentioned in the written instructions, this is not feasible. If there is no sandal bearer, how should one proceed? When asked whether it would be acceptable to leave things as they are, the same person said it would be fine. Also, when asked from which direction one should ascend to the western compound during castle attendance, Kenmotsu replied that those without chambers should ascend from the main entrance.
1. When making rounds, one brings along one sword attendant, one sandal bearer, and one assistant via the inner route to the western compound's rear gate, returning from that location to go around to the lower western compound. This is done at discretion, with the metsuke providing guidance for entry inside.
1. At the regular seating for ceremonial day greetings, after meeting with the sōja-ban, the metsuke gather and proceed to the Teikan room. Lord Matsudaira Noto-no-kami makes the announcement, and soup and sake are bestowed. Through correspondence, gratitude for this fortunate occasion is expressed. Noto-no-kami says it is a joyful and auspicious matter for the celebration, and they proceed to the linked verse room where soup and sake are received. After receiving the second serving, Noto-no-kami comes out, and there are leisurely reception greetings before receiving another serving to conclude.
1. For departure, when asked through a monk to the main seat ō-metsuke Inoue Nōshū about which way would be proper to descend, he replied to exit through the middle gate. For castle attendance, exiting through the main entrance, Kenmotsu said this was incorrect guidance. For castle attendance, the middle gate is also acceptable. Nōshū also conveyed this, saying that records should note the middle gate.

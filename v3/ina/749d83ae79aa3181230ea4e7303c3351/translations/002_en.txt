A Pledge Document Respectfully Submitted

Item: Regarding the stone cutters of our village, we have thoroughly investigated the matter, and there is no one other than those reported this year. Given this situation, we have instructed the stone cutters to conduct themselves properly and follow the righteous path while traveling, and we acknowledge this responsibility. Should you hear of any numbers we have excluded from the records and concealed, please inform us of such matters, which we acknowledge. Should this occur, no matter what punishment may be imposed upon us, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. We submit this pledge for future reference.

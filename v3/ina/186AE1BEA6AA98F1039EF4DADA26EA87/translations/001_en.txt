We have reviewed the memorandum of the 12th.

1. Regarding Namba Shōshō's imperial permission to become Sachūjō on the 7th, we acknowledge that the Densō-shū (court officials who convey imperial messages) have informed us of this matter.

2. Since the position of temple administrator (jumu) at Tōdai-ji in Nanto (Nara) became vacant, the Densō-shū conveyed the imperial permission for Kajū-ji Monzeki to assume the temple administration. Therefore, Tōdai-ji sent a messenger monk as a representative of the temple community to express gratitude, which we have duly noted.

3. We acknowledge that Chishaku-in departed from that location on the 11th to visit the capital, and this matter was conveyed through a visit to your residence.

4. We have received and noted the copy of the document submitted by Seizaemon, son of Magafuchi Ichidayū, along with a letter of recommendation.

5. We have received word that the townhouses in Matsudaira Awaji-no-kami's castle town were destroyed by fire, as reported by Awaji-no-kami's caretaker stationed in that location.

The above.

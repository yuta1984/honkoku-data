Petition submitted in writing

Regarding my house and property located on the south side of Nakamachi, with a frontage of three ken and two sun and depth extending to the boundary, which I permanently transferred to Mr. Ougiya Sahichi in the past year of Bunka Kinoe-uma (1810). This time, due to various circumstances, I paid the principal amount and bought back the said house and property. I received the certificate that had been submitted and requested an official seal cancellation, which was granted. Therefore, I humbly request that the name in the household register be corrected accordingly. The above stated.

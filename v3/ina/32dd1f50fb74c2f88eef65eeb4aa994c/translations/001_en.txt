Document of Submission

Regarding the matter of stone cutters in our village: We have conducted a thorough investigation and found that there are no stone cutters other than those recorded in this year's official report. Should you hear that we have concealed anyone by omitting them from the records, we understand that you should report this matter to the authorities. Furthermore, should we village officials receive any punishment whatsoever, we will harbor no resentment.
This serves as a contractor's certificate for stone cutters for future reference. Respectfully submitted.

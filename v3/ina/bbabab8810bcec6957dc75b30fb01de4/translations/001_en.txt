Regarding Guild Regulations

In recent years, our guild regulations have become lax, making it difficult for all members to continue operations. Therefore, we are now revising them to restore the standards of previous years.

The regulations are as follows:

It goes without saying that the Shogunate's laws must be observed, and the local lord's intentions and house laws must be strictly upheld.

Article 1: For rural customers who do not settle accounts twice yearly (in spring and autumn), all guild members shall refrain from sending goods.

Article 1: When rural customers place orders and pay deposits, if there are members who fail to send the goods, other guild members shall send goods instead, and that person's business shall be suspended.

Article 1: Regarding customers, each member has established their own clientele. However, in recent years, practices such as "cash sales" have become common, which is improper. When visiting to procure goods based on customer orders, if any items are out of stock, they must be purchased with personal funds to ensure timely delivery to the customer.

Article 1: For those who have difficulty selling goods due to limited sales locations, business shall be conducted after consultation among guild members.

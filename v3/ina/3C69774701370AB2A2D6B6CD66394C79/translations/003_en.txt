There was such [a conversation], and since we have sent a son from Kuramatsuya in our town to Goto in Edo, if we exchange new and old gold and silver through that connection, there would be a profit of about one bu per ten ryo. So when Happyaku-hachi went to Iida for wood business settlement, I entrusted him with seven ryo of old silver. After Happyaku-hachi returned, I received the original seven ryo, and although there was supposed to be a profit of two shu, I have not yet received that portion. Since Happyaku-hachi conducts various types of business, there are offsetting accounts between us, so I have left it as is. The money I received was certainly not counterfeit. If there are any suspicions regarding this money, please direct any blame toward me and show mercy regarding Happyaku-hachi's case. I was led astray by a small profit and committed an improper act for which I have no excuse. I deeply apologize. I earnestly request merciful treatment for Happyaku-hachi.

What I have stated above is entirely accurate without any discrepancy.

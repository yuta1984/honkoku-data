Recently, a person from our village called Happyaku-hachi was arrested, and there was an inquiry regarding the handling of suspicious gold coins. Although I understand that he has been keeping quiet about the matter, since I had entrusted money to this person, I wished to provide details of the matter and requested that any blame be directed toward me, while pleading for merciful treatment of the said Happyaku-hachi. When I made this request through an official, I was summoned for questioning. This is my response:

I hereby state the following regarding my case. At the end of this past March, when I went to a place called Hachiman in Iida for paper mulberry settlement accounts, at that time I had a conversation about money exchange with a person called Hanaya Yasuke from Temma-cho.

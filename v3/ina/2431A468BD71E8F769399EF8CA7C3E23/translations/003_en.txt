Fundamentally, regarding guns and arrows, regardless of their size or weight, one entrusts to their power; regardless of the amount of gunpowder or shooting distance, one harmonizes with the degree of projectile firing and mechanism, each following what is appropriate.

If the system entirely harmonizes with what is appropriate, how could the sounds fail to be in harmony? The Book of Changes says: "The army goes forth according to the pitch pipes; if not, it harbors misfortune." One must be cautious about this again.

Document of Additional Pledge Submitted

Item: This time I have been humbly appointed to the position of cleaning service for Gongen-sama, for which I am deeply grateful. It has been agreed in the contract that as compensation for this service, I shall be allowed to reside in the dwelling that I have pledged as collateral. However, as repair fees, I must without fail submit seven monme and five bu of silver each year-end to the authorities. Furthermore, going forward permanently, I shall without fail perform the cleaning duties on the 14th, 24th, and last day of each month. Should I violate the schedule, fail to clean, or perform my duties negligently in any other way, I may be replaced even midway through the term without reservation, and I shall immediately vacate the dwelling. At that time, regardless of who is appointed as replacement, I shall harbor no resentment whatsoever. During the term, since the dwelling is dedicated as a cleaning residence for Gongen-sama, I shall treat everything with utmost care and shall never neglect the cleaning duties even once. Should the principal party err in understanding, the guarantors shall take responsibility for the cleaning duties and, of course, handle all other matters according to instructions, ensuring no trouble whatsoever is caused to the officials. This pledge is made for future reference.

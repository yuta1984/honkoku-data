Document of submission

Item: Four ryō of gold

Regarding the above, for the Western outer field that was previously deposited as collateral for a debt of gratitude, we humbly request redemption for twenty-five ryō of gold. Of this amount, I have borrowed the aforementioned money as capital for my private business, and there is no error in this matter. From now on, I will work diligently to continue my business, and upon doing so, I will repay the aforementioned money. Since you have graciously handled and lent this money for my livelihood, I will not forget this matter and will work day and night with devotion to repay you. This borrowing certificate is for future reference. Therefore, as stated.

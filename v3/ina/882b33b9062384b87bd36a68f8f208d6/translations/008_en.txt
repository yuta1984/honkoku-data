　Official permits, lanterns, and hanging signs are provided
　to you, so they must not be used carelessly for purposes
　other than exchange office duties. A written pledge
　to this effect must be submitted.
1. Though it goes without saying,
　conduct yourself with sincerity so that there are no hindrances
　to exchanges. Should there be any delays,
　it would cause inconvenience
　and deprive the people of their convenience,
　which would be a serious matter.
　Therefore, keep this in mind and
　make every sincere effort.

The above articles should be thoroughly understood.

　October　Bureau of Accounts

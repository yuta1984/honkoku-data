Regarding the matter of travel permits for women passing through Kyoto and the western provinces: as was done during the time of Tsuchiya Sagami-no-kami, from now on we shall affix our official seal. Therefore, compare this with the seal authentication, and if there are no discrepancies, allow passage.

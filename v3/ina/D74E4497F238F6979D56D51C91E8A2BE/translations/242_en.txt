Regarding the above mountain, there was a dispute between Miyasho Village and eight villages of Shinshū Minowa domain: Ōide Village, Sawa Village, Yaotome Village, Shimo-Furuta Village, Kami-Furuta Village, Tomita Village, Matsushima Village, and Kinoshita Village. Due to this mountain dispute, it was not recorded in the registers during the land survey of the previous Uma year (1810). However, on the 6th day of the 8th month of this Hitsuji year, an official decision was rendered at the Council of State (Hyōjōsho), determining that the disputed mountain belonged to Miyasho Village. An official endorsement was written on the map and given to Miyasho Village. Therefore, we have now inquired at the Finance Office (Kanjoōsho) and received official endorsement. Using the map, we have examined the notable places in the mountain area and Hirasawa, and will add additional records later.

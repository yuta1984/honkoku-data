In the fourth year of Kaei, the year of the Metal Boar, on the night of the nineteenth day of the first month,
Daihōzan Kenpuku Kōkoku Zen Temple suffered a fire disaster and was instantly
reduced to ashes. The parishioners threw in their good wealth to attempt reconstruction,
and at that time, there was an imperial command, and those in the position of head parishioner requested
people such as the village headman and town elder to collect donations from the parishioners, which were then offered to the temple.

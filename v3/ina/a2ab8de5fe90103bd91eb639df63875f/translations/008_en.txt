- For items sold at the exhibition venue, expenses will be added and calculated for the sale price, therefore the original cost should be provided when exchanging the receipt ticket.
- Items not for sale will be returned with a small token of appreciation at the end of the exhibition.
- For those who wish to retrieve their items before the exhibition ends, they should state their intention. Items will be returned at any time in exchange for the deposit receipt.
- When foreigners submit items, they should provide the original document with a Japanese translation attached. Other procedures remain the same as the previous articles.

Following these articles, we humbly hope that many items will be submitted to receive public evaluation from various countries and to make this exhibition prosperous.

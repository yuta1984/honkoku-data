Medicine is a profession that holds authority over human life and death, and is truly no easy matter. However, in remote areas, there are still few who have mastered its profound principles, and since the art of treatment is naturally not clear, there are often those who meet unnatural deaths, which is most pitiable. A hospital has been opened in Matsumoto Yangdo-machi with medical staff stationed there to provide treatment. Not only those within the jurisdiction, but anyone who wishes may go there at their convenience to receive treatment. This matter is hereby communicated again.

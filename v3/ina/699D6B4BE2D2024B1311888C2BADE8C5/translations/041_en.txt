In the eighth month of this year, he was granted Sanuki Province and moved there. In the summer of Tenshō 14, it was reported that Shimazu of Satsuma was not obeying the Kanpaku's orders and was trying to destroy the Ōtomo of Bungo. Hidehisa was appointed as an envoy and, together with Chōsokabe Tosa-no-kami Motochika, led the forces of Shikoku and crossed over to Bungo Province. Hidehisa first sent an envoy to Shimazu to relay the Kanpaku's orders once again, but Shimazu captured the envoy and gave no reply. Instead, he invaded from Higo Province into Bungo Province, attacked and captured Ōtomo's castle. Hearing that Hetsugi Toshimitsu's battle at Tsuruga Castle was already in dire straits, and that the situation was urgent and could not wait for the lord's orders, Hidehisa, together with Motochika, led Ōtomo's forces to relieve Hetsugi Castle.

On the morning of the twelfth day of the twelfth month, they crossed the Hetsugigawa River and fought against Shimazu's forces, but their allies were thoroughly defeated, and Motochika's eldest son Nobuchika was killed in battle. 《Note: his given name was Yasaburō》 When the Kanpaku heard of this, he said, "This is no trivial matter! The vanguard forces should not engage in battle recklessly. I told them to hold the enemy at bay by any means and wait for Hideyoshi to arrive. Yet these men from Shikoku conducted a rash campaign and were defeated in direct combat - how disgraceful! Now that Nobuchika has died, I will temporarily forgive his father Motochika's crime, but confiscate Sengoku's domain!" He seized Sanuki Province and granted it to Bitō Jinzaemon-no-jō, appointing him to the vanguard in Tsukushi. In the spring of the following fifteenth year, the lord himself set out for the land of Tsukushi.

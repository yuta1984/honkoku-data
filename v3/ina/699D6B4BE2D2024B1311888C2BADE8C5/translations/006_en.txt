was selected among them, and he also became a commander of ashigaru (foot soldiers), changing his name to Muto Kihei. After his elder brother died in battle, he inherited the family and resided at Ueda Castle in Shinano Province, taking the name Sanada Awa-no-kami. 《Note: At this time he held 38,000 koku》 In the 10th year of Tensho, after the Takeda house was destroyed, he surrendered to Lord Oda and had his domain confirmed. In the 6th month of the same year, Nobunaga was also killed, and when he heard that Uesugi Danjodaibu Kagekatsu was again dispatching forces to the eastern provinces, the provincial lords of Shinano Province - beginning with Sanada, Ashida, and Ogasawara - wrote a pledge stating they would become retainers of the Uesugi for a long time and submitted it to Echigo Province. On the 18th day of the 6th month of the same year, Kagekatsu dispatched forces to Shinano. Beginning with Sanada, all the provincial lords went to the Uesugi camp and had an audience.

Perhaps Sanada and others relied on the Hojo having superior numbers, as they conspired with Ujinao, betraying their allegiance to plot against Kagekatsu. However, as soon as Kagekatsu heard of this, he cut off the head of Kosaka Gengoro, who resided at Kaizu Castle, and sent it to the Hojo camp, so the conspiracy of Sanada and others was quickly exposed. Ujinao advanced as the vanguard toward Kawanakajima to fight the Uesugi. The Uesugi forces numbered over 4,000 men 《Note: Said to be over 4,300》 and advanced to fight against the Hojo's over 50,000 horsemen 《Note: Said to be 55,000 men》. Perhaps thinking that the small Uesugi force would be difficult to attack, the Hojo withdrew from here, entered Kai Province, and fought with Lord Tokugawa. This lasted from mid-7th month until the 11th month.

《marginal note: He died on the twenty-fifth day at the age of twenty-five, and his younger brother Rokurō Michimitsu inherited the family headship. From the first year of Ōei to the first year of Kyōroku when Naotaka was born, it was approximately one hundred and thirty-odd years》
《marginal note: It is also doubtful that one hundred and thirty-odd years passed during the three generations from Michiyuki to Naotaka. I think there must be people missing from the genealogy between Michiyuki's grandson Gyōbu-dayū Michinori and Naotaka》
Naotaka had two sons: the elder was Ichisuke Naosue, and the younger was Shirōzaemon Naomori.
Naosue served Lord Oda following his father, and after Nobunaga was killed, he served Hideyoshi. When Hideyoshi waged war against Lord Kitabatake, in the summer of Tenshō 12, he captured Takenohana Castle in Mino Province and granted it to Naosue. 《marginal note: 30,000 koku》He also appointed him Izu-no-kami. In the same year, Tenshō 18, when the Hōjō of Sagami were defeated, Naosue led the vanguard at Yamanaka Castle and died in battle.
The Kanpaku (Hideyoshi) deeply mourned him and had his younger brother Naomori succeed to the family headship, appointed him Kenbutsu, and moved him to Kuroda Castle in Owari Province.

As a reward, he was granted Kanbe Castle in Ise Province. 《marginal note: The Supplement to Ietada's Diary shows it was granted in the following year, Keichō 6. Other writings all say it was granted in the eleventh month of Keichō 5, and mention either 70,000 koku or 50,000 koku》
《marginal note: Both theories are difficult to determine》In the same year, Keichō 10, he sent his second son Naoya as a hostage to the Kantō region. The Shogun's family showed favor, and he immediately received their benevolence. 《marginal note: stipend for eighty-odd retainers》
In Keichō 14, his sons received court ranks: his eldest son Naoshige became Tango-no-kami, and his second son Naoya was appointed Mimasaku-no-kami. In the battles before and after Ōsaka, father and sons both rushed to fight and presented forty severed heads. Naomori served successive generations of the Shogun's family.
By the time of the Sadaijin family (the third Shogun Iemitsu), since Iyo Province was the ancestral land of generations past

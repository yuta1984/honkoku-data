　　　Ichihashi
Shimōsa-no-kami Fujiwara Nagakatsu was the son of Iki-no-kami Nagatoshi. His ancestor was a resident of Ichihashi-shō in Ikeda District, Mino Province. 《marginal note: His ancestors were of the Fujiwara clan, a cadet branch of the Sanjō family, called Senjun, who first settled in the eastern provinces. How many generations from this person to Nagatoshi is not detailed. According to one theory, he was of the Yamato Genji lineage - Narita Saburō Mitsuharu received the position of land steward (jitō) of Ichihashi-shō in Ikeda District, Mino Province as a reward after the Jōkyū War, and afterward his descendants lived in that province and took the name Ichihashi. Mitsuharu's seventh-generation descendant, Shichirō Jiza'emon-no-jō Toshiharu, had no heir and had Toshihisa, from a cadet branch of the Sanjō family, succeed to the family headship. Toshihisa was appointed Iki-no-kami and after entering religious life was called Senjun. This person was the father of Iki-no-kami Nagatoshi》Nagatoshi initially served under Lord Oda, later followed Kanpaku Hideyoshi, and died on the thirteenth day of the third month of Tenshō 13 at the age of seventy-three. Shimōsa-no-kami Nagakatsu also served both the Oda and Hashiba houses and ruled Imao Castle in Mino Province. 《marginal note: 20,000 koku》In the autumn of Keichō 5, he followed Lord Tokugawa's campaign in Ōshū and was in the eastern provinces when forces in the Kamigata region rose up again.

Memorandum

1. Regarding the matter of the rice stipend (gekomai) associated with the reconstruction of both shrines at Ise, we have received a request from the court nobles who serve as intermediaries (densōshū). As per precedent, this should be received through the shrine's liaison official (densō bugyō) with the endorsement of Okabe Suruga-no-kami. We acknowledge that this should be communicated accordingly.

1. Suzuki Ichibei, who is in charge of twenty-one firearms, reports that all are damaged beyond use and cannot even be employed for boar and deer hunting this time. He requests that they be exchanged for new firearms. Regarding this matter, when we inquired with the firearms magistrate (teppō bugyō) about exchanging them with serviceable firearms from our arsenal, we received confirmation that this would be possible. We acknowledge the proposal that Ichibei should be instructed accordingly for the exchange. Concerning the damaged firearms, those that can be repaired should be handled as such, while those unfit for official use should be set aside. We understand that Hayashi Seibei and Tsuzuki Sōbei should be instructed accordingly.

1. Regarding the repair of Atago Shrine hall, we were informed that construction cannot begin without a temporary relocation of the deity. We acknowledge that instructions should be given to proceed with lightweight construction work instead.

1. Concerning the matter of the courtesy visit by the successor abbot of Kōshōji Temple, which Nishi Honganji Temple has inquired about through a messenger, we have received and acknowledged their request. A messenger should be dispatched accordingly.

1. Regarding Nabeshima Kii-no-kami, we received word through a messenger that Nabeshima Kaga-no-kami of the same clan is unwell, and that Kii-no-kami will therefore return to his domain. We acknowledge this information.

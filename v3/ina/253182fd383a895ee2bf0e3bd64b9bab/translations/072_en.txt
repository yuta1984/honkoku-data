　　　Humbly submitting this oral statement as a petition
Since I was appointed as a new employee of the construction department last year of the Dog,
regarding the religious registry matter, I wish to take my wife, children, and dependents with me to become members of a separate religious registry.
Concerning this matter, regarding the succession of the Miyoshi-ya business, I wish to have my younger brother Matashichi succeed to it.
Therefore I submit this petition.
Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously order as I have petitioned out of your compassion, it would be a most grateful blessing. The above stated, Shinmachi

As a result, my son Ushinosuke came to my side, while my daughter Mume went to the other side, divided through the mediation of both Kanashima Yagobeemon and Yoshiuemon of Hikage village. Therefore, in the second month of last year of the Dog, I went together with Jiuemon to the village headman Iuemon's place and requested to be removed from the religious register.

Humbly submitted petition in writing

I have been operating as a dyer with fifteen indigo vats until now, but from this year I wish to reduce the number to thirteen vats. Therefore, I humbly submit this petition.

Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously approve this petition as requested, it would be most grateful and fortunate. Respectfully submitted.

Humbly submitted petition in writing

Regarding the repair of the house in front of Inari shrine and other buildings within the district, as this is beyond our own financial means, we wish to perform acrobatics and comic theater at Benzaiten riverbank for five clear days starting from the 25th of this month as a means of fundraising. Therefore, we humbly submit this petition.

Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously approve this petition as requested through your benevolence, it would be most grateful and fortunate. Respectfully submitted.

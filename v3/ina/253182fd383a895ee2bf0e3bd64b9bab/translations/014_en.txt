Regarding this matter, although the petition states that no repayment has been made at all, it appears that some gradual repayments have indeed been made. Even during my late father's lifetime, though we had only small amounts of money, we gave it to them twice. Moreover, due to extreme financial hardship both internally and externally, we repeatedly asked those three people for extensions, and with their understanding, they granted extensions during his lifetime. Even after Rokubei's death, there were no particular demands for payment. However, last year when they filed a lawsuit in Edo, they needed funds for expenses. Though I am in financial distress, my relatives gathered and managed to provide two ryō. Also, when those people returned home at the end of last year, they demanded payment based on a proportional accounting, so I was compelled to arrange one ryō and two bu from that amount.

Due to repeated demands, as you are aware, we are in financial distress, so I pleaded with them to accept gradual payments, but they would not listen. This regrettably led to the lawsuit, for which I deeply apologize. I humbly request your merciful consideration, understanding that I am in financial distress as you know, and ask that you order them to accept gradual payments.
I am still young, and it is difficult to support my mother, so I have gone to serve in Matsumoto castle town, while my mother survives day by day through the mutual assistance of relatives. Though my circumstances are extremely impoverished, as stated above, if they would accept gradual payments, I would like to make gradual repayments. I humbly request that you mercifully order this arrangement.

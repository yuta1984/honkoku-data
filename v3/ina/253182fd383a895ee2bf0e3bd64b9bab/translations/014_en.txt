The petition states that no repayment has been made at all, but it can also be seen that some small amounts were indeed repaid. Even during my late father's lifetime, although the amounts were small, he paid the creditors twice, and furthermore, due to extreme financial hardship both internally and externally, he repeatedly requested extensions from the three creditors, and with their understanding, payments were deferred during his lifetime. After Rokubei's death, there were no particular demands for payment, but last year there were expenses required for a lawsuit in Edo. Despite my dire financial circumstances, relatives gathered together and managed to provide two ryo which were paid to them. Also, last winter when these people returned to their home province, they presented a settlement statement and demanded payment, so I was compelled to manage somehow and paid one ryo and two bu toward this amount.

Due to repeated demands for payment, as you well know of my financial difficulties, I pleaded that they accept payment in installments, but they would not listen. This truly unavoidably led to a lawsuit, for which I am deeply apologetic. I humbly request that with your mercy, recognizing that I am in financial distress as you are aware, you would order them to accept gradual repayment.
I am still young and unable to properly care for my mother, so I went to serve in Matsumoto castle town, while my mother survives day by day through the mutual assistance of relatives. Our circumstances are extremely difficult, but as I stated above, if they would accept gradual repayment, I would like to make payments over time. I humbly request that you mercifully order this arrangement.

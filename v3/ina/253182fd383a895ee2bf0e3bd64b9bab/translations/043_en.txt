　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Town Representative: Shōzō
　　To the Magistrate's Office

　　Humbly, I submit this petition in writing
1. I unexpectedly received the appointment to serve as town representative, which I
   considered a great honor, and have served faithfully for many years. However, I have
   become aged and infirm, and moreover suffer from poor health, making it difficult
   to fulfill my official duties. Therefore, I humbly petition for permission to resign from my position.

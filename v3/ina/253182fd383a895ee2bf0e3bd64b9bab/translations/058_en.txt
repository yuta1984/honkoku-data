The above document was submitted to the magistrate's office on the 15th through Mr. Izawa's intermediation. When calculations were made on the 25th, it was found that there would be profit, so we received official word to continue as before for now. Yorozuya Shōzō was called and informed of this matter. The above document was returned to us, so we are delivering it.

Respectfully submitted as a verbal petition

One case of absconders, three persons: Kyōya Mankichi, 22 years old in the current year of the Boar
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　His mother, 53 years old in the current year of the Boar  
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　His younger sister, 21 years old in the current year of the Boar

These persons are my relatives, but last September the mother took the younger sister and they departed casually. We relatives searched the nearby areas, but their whereabouts remain unknown. Although they were normally honest people, we cannot predict what kind of trouble they might cause in the future. Therefore, we request that they be recorded in the register of absconders.

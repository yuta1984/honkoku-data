Regarding the pledge we hereby submit:
Article 1: When stonemasons go to work temporarily in other provinces, we will conduct strict examinations within our group, register them in the population records, establish guarantors, and send them out. Of course, we will ensure that annual taxes and official duties are completed without delay.
Article 2: Regarding the prohibitions decreed by the Shogunate, it goes without saying that we will never violate the official regulations that have been constantly proclaimed, wherever we may go. We will strictly observe this point.

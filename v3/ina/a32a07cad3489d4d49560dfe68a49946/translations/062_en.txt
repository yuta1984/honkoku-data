Regarding cinnabar and cinnabar ink, besides the cinnabar guild (shuza), licensed brokers were appointed in Edo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, and Sakai, and it was proclaimed in Kansei 8 (year of the dragon) that people could freely purchase from both the cinnabar guild and these brokers through designated agents. However, since these brokers were subsequently suspended, it was ordered that purchases should henceforth be made directly from the guild. Nevertheless, it was proclaimed in the previous year of the rabbit that there would be no problem with retailing cinnabar in its original guild packaging at proper prices.

However, since the brokers in the aforementioned five locations are now being reinstated as originally planned, people should follow the regulations as proclaimed during the Kansei era. If we hear of anyone secretly buying or selling goods of suspicious origin beyond this point, they will be severely punished after investigation.

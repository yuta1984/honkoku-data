In the presence of Lord Unuma Ichirōemon, the following was proclaimed:

Nunoya (Cloth Shop)
Manbei

Regarding this person, we had previously ordered that conducting business with samurai households, rural areas, and temples should not be permitted to those outside the merchant guild. However, due to special circumstances, we now grant permission for him to visit rural areas and temples, and there shall be no problem with his presence here as well. However, except for samurai households and the eight temple parishes in the castle town, business remains prohibited as before. We believe there are circumstances behind your request, but you must still be mindful of your social status and conduct yourself with propriety to avoid any misunderstandings. Accordingly, from now on, this does not mean that those outside the same trade guild are not permitted.

Each person present shall convey the above instructions. That is all.

November 15th
Lord Tateishi Yogoemon
Written Statement

As proclaimed above, we requested an audience with both magistrates accompanied by the town representative, and furthermore ordered that courtesy visits be made to the assistant officials.

She was gradually able to continue her business, and was determined to fulfill her husband's intentions. However, the following year she suffered fire damage, and afterwards moved to Nakamachi where she engaged in goods trading. When purchasing various merchandise, she would go out to rural areas herself, working hard at her business. However, there were debts remaining from when her husband Seizaburo was still alive, and with insufficient capital, it became difficult to continue the business. Therefore, she had no choice but to move to her owned house in Shinmachi. She placed her children with other families for apprenticeships and job training, working diligently. During cocoon purchasing season, she would travel two to three ri to rural areas for procurement, working hard from silk thread spinning to silk weaving without a moment's rest. Meanwhile, her relationships with relatives remained harmonious, and this has been improving even further, as we have heard. Previously, coins were granted to her, and since then we have heard that she pays particular attention and works diligently at her family business. As this is praiseworthy conduct, coins are once again granted as further commendation. She should understand the meaning of this benevolent favor and continue to strive even harder.

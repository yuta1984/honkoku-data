600 mon coins　　Sakuji

You have been serving as a shop apprentice at Bunjuro's establishment in the same town since the Year of the Rabbit, working faithfully. Later, when your original household finances became difficult and the aforementioned Bunjuro fell seriously ill for a long time, you sincerely cared for him during his illness. Ultimately, you never went against your father's instructions, maintained harmony in the household, and worked diligently in business, as we have heard. Previously, coins were granted to you, and since then we have heard that you continue to maintain household harmony and conduct business faithfully. As this is extremely commendable, coins are once again granted in recognition of your praiseworthy conduct. In appreciation of this benevolent favor, you shall continue to work even more diligently.

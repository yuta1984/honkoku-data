If such persons are found, they should be detained at that location. For government lands (goryōchi), report to the local magistrate (daikan); for private domains, report to the domain lord or local administrator (jitō). From there, reports should be made to the appropriate temple and shrine magistrate (jisha bugyō) in Edo. If anyone sees or hears of such persons, they must also report this. Furthermore, retainers and servants should be carefully examined, and anyone who conceals information and is discovered through other means will be subject to punishment.

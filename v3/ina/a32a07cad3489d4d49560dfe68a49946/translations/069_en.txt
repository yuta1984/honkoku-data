However, regarding geta thongs, zori straps, etc.,
use simple ones as much as possible,
and avoid unnecessary expenses.

The above articles have been proclaimed in official notices from long ago,
and strict enforcement within the domain
has been ordered. There are official regulations
for clothing and various other items that should be observed.
However, as years have passed, young people
do not properly understand the official prohibitions,
and there are some who are misguided. Therefore,
this is proclaimed again in official notices. These rules must be strictly observed,
and when there are disruptions to business, gather at the town office
and repeatedly read these aloud to ensure that even servants
and the lowest ranks do not miss hearing them. Should there be anyone who is misguided,
not only will that person be held responsible,
but even the town officials will be found at fault.

As stated above, this was proclaimed in the sixth month
of Tenpō 13 (1842), year of the Tiger, and again
in the seventh month of the year of the Rooster.
However, the use of prohibited
items has recently become particularly common among women and children
who are misguided.

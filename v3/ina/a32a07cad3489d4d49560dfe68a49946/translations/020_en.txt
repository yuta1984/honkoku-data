Regarding the cessation of circulation of old gold and silver coins with genuine characters, two-bu denomination, old two-shu silver coins, as well as Bunsei-era character gold and silver coins with grass script two-bu denomination, two-shu silver coins, and one-shu coins - although an order was issued last year of the Rooster to exchange these by October of this year of the Dog, there have been many requests for exchange. Therefore, the exchange offices will continue to operate as before until October of the coming year of the Boar. For all matters, follow the instructions previously issued, and conduct exchanges within the specified time limit. For government lands, the magistrates shall carefully oversee this; for private domains, the domain lords and local governors shall do so.

Issue this order as stated above.

One, The frugality edict of the 24th day is as follows:
　Regarding clothing as well as combs, kōgai, and hairpins
　There have been strict regulations from long ago, but
　there is a tendency toward extravagance and some people
　are misguided, and even after issuing reprimands through proper channels,
　there are still those who rarely use prohibited items
　This is improper conduct. Clothing should be limited to
　cotton only, and sleeve openings and half-collars should also avoid silk fabrics and
　striped patterns with silk threads, as well as gold, silver, and tortoiseshell, which
　go without saying. Colored combs that resemble the above items,
　hairpins, combs, and kōgai are all the more strictly prohibited.

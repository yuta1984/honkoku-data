Such matters should be instructed as follows:

1. Since children are sometimes borrowed from other districts for dancing performances due to arrangements within the town districts, after札踊り (tag dancing) and other performances are completed, people gather at the homes of the children's parents, and dancing may naturally occur under the influence of alcohol. However, such practices have been strictly prohibited from the past.

1. Regarding the Gongen Festival, young people in the city and shamisen players invited from nearby villages must not make mistakes regarding prohibited clothing and other items that have been repeatedly ordered under the established regulations.
   Note: Those who patrol the rural districts shall be strictly instructed to enforce these reforms.

1. Similarly to the above, from adult men and women in the city down to children, there must be no misunderstanding regarding prohibited items such as clothing, silver hairpins, silver and gold ornaments, fabric aprons, and other goods that have been repeatedly regulated under the established system, and these should be reformed accordingly.
   Note: The same as stated above.

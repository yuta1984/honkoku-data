Memorandum
Regarding craftsmen including woodcutters, plasterers, and installation specialists: while we have permitted the employment of one apprentice each after receiving approval, there have been some who misunderstand the regulations regarding the completion of their terms of service. Therefore, from now on, when employing an apprentice, a tag indicating their term of service shall be issued. With this understanding, a request for dismissal should be submitted by the end of March in the year following the completion of their term.
After circulating the above instructions, those who keep apprentices without proper tags will be investigated and strictly punished. That is all.

1. Regarding the government forest of Kayama Village (charcoal mountain, small entrance) and the outer Aragami shrine, these have not been granted.
The granting of undergrowth harvested from these two locations to Oshima Village, Kawate Village, Aoshima Village, and Nosoko Village in Kawashimo district came about because during the previous cultivation of Rokudohara (present-day Suehiro Village), the people of these four villages frequently complained that this was their meeting place and the situation interfered with fertilizer for their rice fields. Therefore, it was explained that substitute grass would be provided from government forests later, and subsequently undergrowth began to be granted from the government forest of Nakamura in Fujisawa district.
Every year they perform labor service and harvest the grass, but Nakamura complained that crops were being trampled and damaged by large numbers of horses, causing hardship. The four villages also complained that there was no place to tether horses and transportation was difficult due to the remote location. Due to these complaints from both sides, in the 4th year of Meiji (1871), it was decided to transfer the undergrowth grants to Kayama Village.

1. Government forest of Kitabayashi Village (Tenjin Forest)
The existence of a Tenjin shrine within this government forest dates from ancient times, though the year and month of its establishment are unknown. During the land survey in the 3rd year of Genroku (1690), even before the former Takato domain period, the forest registry recorded it as "Tenjin Forest," so while its origins are unclear, all shrine maintenance has been conducted at village expense from the beginning. The forestry office has had no involvement whatsoever, leaving it to village customs.

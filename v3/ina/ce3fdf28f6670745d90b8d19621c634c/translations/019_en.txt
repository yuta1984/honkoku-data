Explanation: The extension of the aforementioned rear passage is located within the rear passage of the house lot on the west side owned by Minuemon.

The aforementioned rear entrance, which was previously six ken wide, has been reduced to three ken for the following reason: originally, the frontage of the house was fixed at three ken, and the land in the shadow of the three-ken square earthwork had been used as the rear entrance until now. Therefore, this time we have reformed it so that the rear entrance is three ken, and the remaining three ken will serve as side land.

shall undertake these responsibilities.

1. Regarding the pack-horse transport villages of Ina District, since this has been their practice since ancient times, even if river transport is granted permission this time, for local products, rice grains, and pack-horse cargo bound for Owari Province, Mikawa Province, as well as Iida, Matsumoto, Suwa, Takato, and other castle towns and villages, absolutely no boat transport shall be conducted for either outbound or return journeys.

In accordance with the aforementioned articles of agreement, there shall be no obstruction during Tenryu River navigation. Should any difficulties arise in other villages beyond these, dialogue shall be conducted with all villages concerned, and in any case, the petitioners shall ensure that the villages do not suffer hardship. These articles of agreement shall not be altered hereafter and all parties shall abide by them. Since both parties have thoroughly read and understood these terms, we humbly request that you graciously complete your deliberation and grant approval at this point.

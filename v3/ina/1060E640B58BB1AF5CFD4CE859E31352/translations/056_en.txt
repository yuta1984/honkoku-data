During the reign of Lord Yoriyasu
- On the 5th day of the 8th month of Tempo 5 (Horse year), he was newly summoned and granted a stipend of 10 men's provisions.

Accordingly, matters of rank and seating order would be announced later, and he was placed at the lowest seat among the guard unit retainers.

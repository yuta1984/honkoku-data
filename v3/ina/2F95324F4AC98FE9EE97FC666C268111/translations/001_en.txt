Memorandum

1. Regarding the white wood inspection matter, the official documents should be cross-referenced and processed by the government office.
   However, when Oya Jinpei and Kumai Iheiji from the procurement department submit their certificates, these should also be processed.

1. Once the aforementioned certificates are completed, they should be submitted to the government office. Other than these, small vouchers, seals, etc. shall never be used. If there are any difficult matters, they should be set aside and immediately reported to the government office. Attention should also be paid during nighttime.

The above should be strictly observed and inspected.

With all due respect, I humbly petition with this written request.
Although I am inadequate in my abilities, I was appointed to the firewood department duties, granted assistance, and received rice allowances, for which I am deeply grateful.
However, I have been ill since this spring, and my condition has become particularly severe at present, with no prospect of complete recovery. I humbly request that you show mercy and grant me release from my official duties. The above.

May, Meiji 3　Miyashita Genemon (seal)

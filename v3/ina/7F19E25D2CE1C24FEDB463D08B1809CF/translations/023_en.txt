　　　With all due respect, I humbly submit this written petition.
Regarding the wood craftsman Jūzaemon whom I have taken under my charge, when he went to Nagoya,
a person called Nuinosuke went to Himochiyama Village, and at Oguro River
he was staying at Sashikyō Mountain. Since one mountain area has been consolidated, I wish to discontinue this and humbly petition. Please,
in your mercy, grant exemption from the tribute tax.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Petitioner: Sōhachi
The petition submitted by the aforementioned Sōhachi has been graciously approved, and we are all most grateful.

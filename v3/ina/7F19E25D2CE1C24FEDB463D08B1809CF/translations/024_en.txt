This time, I wish to take under my charge a person named Yokobuki Jinbei Katsuya from the silver magistrate's territory,
and have him work making geta (wooden clogs) at the government forest of Okatsuya Hatsuzawa.
For each person, I would like to pay one ryō as mountain cutting tax.
Please, in your mercy, grant permission as requested in this petition.

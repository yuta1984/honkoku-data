Respectfully submitting this written petition

One: Gold coins of 10 ryō 2 bu and silver of 2 monme 3 bu 4 rin
　　　Of which: Gold coins of 2 ryō and silver of 6 monme 4 bu 6 rin 8 mō - one year's payment
　The aforementioned persons have borrowed advance money for firewood procurement and have fallen behind in payments. As they are extremely impoverished, we petition that they be allowed to make payments in five annual installments from the end of this Year of the Horse (Meiji 3, 1870) until the end of the coming Year of the Dog. We humbly request your merciful consideration of this petition, and if granted as requested, we would be most grateful.

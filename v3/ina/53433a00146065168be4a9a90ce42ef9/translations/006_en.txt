Due to this hereditary connection, my descendants have been permanently granted audience with superiors and permission to bear family names and wear swords. In the fourth year of Ansei (1857), year of the Snake, my son Shōzō was appointed as an apprentice messenger and received stipend support, benefiting from great benevolence. Furthermore, I have received clothing, formal court dress repeatedly, as well as various goods on numerous occasions. In the previous Snake year, I was granted permission to carry a walking stick within the Sannomaru compound - truly an extremely fortunate blessing for which I am deeply grateful. I have wished to work diligently to repay this great benevolence, but I have been nearsighted from birth, and recently this condition has worsened considerably. Moreover, my chronic colic attacks occur frequently, causing me great difficulty. I deeply apologize for making this request during these pressing times, but

I humbly request that you grant me release from the above-mentioned official duties.
Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously grant my request as I have humbly petitioned, I would consider it a most grateful blessing.

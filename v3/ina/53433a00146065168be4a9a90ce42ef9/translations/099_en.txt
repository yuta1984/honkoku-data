10th day
Regarding the above petition, the official seal was applied as usual, and when the town official
submitted it to the branch office, concerning the five-day performance,
due to a procedural error with the prefectural government, various instructions were given
that the town official should personally deliver and submit it.
The town official made a proxy visit, and on the 12th day approval was granted.
The official returned home, a proxy reported to the Administrative Office,
and a proxy notification was also sent to us here.

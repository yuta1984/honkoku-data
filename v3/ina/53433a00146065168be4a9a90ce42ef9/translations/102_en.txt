I humbly submit this oral petition
Regarding the case of Ōta Rissai from the 20th day of the 5th month that we petitioned about,
we are grateful that you granted us an official response. However, since the private settlement has
been reached, we will absolutely never raise any
objections in the future. Therefore, we petition for the withdrawal of our petition.

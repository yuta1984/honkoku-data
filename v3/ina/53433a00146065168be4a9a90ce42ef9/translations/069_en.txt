Written Pledge Regarding Prohibitions

1. Regarding all prohibitions in general, we have always understood their meaning as has been proclaimed from time to time. Furthermore, this time we have made sure that all townspeople, both great and small, within the town understand their meaning by having them read aloud.

1. Regarding religious sects, after this spring's inspection, we were ordered to investigate whether there were any persons of suspicious religious sects, with the five-household groups mutually investigating each other. The town representative and group heads conducted an inspection together, and we found that there were no discrepancies from the spring inspection, and no suspicious persons were present.

As stated above, we have conducted an inspection limited to our town and found no discrepancies. We hereby submit this written pledge for future reference. Therefore, as stated.

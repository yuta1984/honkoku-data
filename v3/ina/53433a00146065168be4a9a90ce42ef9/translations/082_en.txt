The official notice board location in this town was
located in front of the wholesale merchant until the Kyōhō era,
but due to frequent fires in the vicinity around that time,
maintenance and other duties could not be properly carried out, so it was

cliff where river winds blow up, and during strong wind periods, it is frequently blown
down and damaged, which we deeply regret. Those who have been discussing this matter for years
[request] relocation of the site to the north embankment area of Hokomochi-machi Masugata

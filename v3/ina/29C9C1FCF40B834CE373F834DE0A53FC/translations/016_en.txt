　　During the Wada-Hōjō conflict, Mitsuyori served under Hōjō Kuranosuke Yasutoki and was granted Yahino-shō in Heibe District, Bōshū Province, where he resided. He greatly reformed the name from Yahi to Nakazawa-shō. At that time, when the national regent Hōjō Sakon-dayū Shōgen Tokiyori built Kenchō-ji Temple, Mitsuyori served as the magistrate. He died at age seventeen on the 22nd day of the 11th month of Kōchō 3 (1267), year of the boar.
　　At this time, Nakatsu Samanosuke Mitsuyori received the entire province of Shinshū Takatō from Tokiyori as his retirement estate. Mitsuyori made pilgrimages to Kenchō-ji in Kamakura, Mount Kōya, and Zenkō-ji in Shinshū, praying for Tokiyori's spiritual well-being. He made vows to the principal Buddha for the afterlife, and on the 15th day of the 3rd month of Bun'ei 2 (1265), he committed seppuku in Takatō. His remains were buried in the mountain area of Anayama. At this time, of the retainers who served him, two committed seppuku following Mitsuyori, and one built a hermitage at this place to pray for their afterlife salvation.

Genealogical Extract of the Same Surname's Aizu Family Line - As in the Original Text
[Previous content omitted]
Sakai Kinpō served the Takeda family of Kōshū for generations. His eldest son was called Ukon-no-suke Nobuzane, and his second son was called Sakyō-no-suke Mitsuzane. His youngest daughter was a concubine of Takeda Shingen. In the second year of Genki, when Shingen heard that she had become pregnant, he bestowed upon the concubine a certificate written in his own hand and a tanto sword with a left-handed inscription. In the sixth month of the third year of the same era, she gave birth safely at the Anayama residence - it was a male child. Named Kanjūrō, he was Lord Takeda Shingen's youngest son.
When this Kanjūrō was eleven years old, Takeda Katsuyori died in battle and the Takeda family perished, so he became a wanderer. He was taken in as an adopted child by his uncle Sakai Sakyō-no-suke Mitsuzane's family, changed his name to Sakai Shinzaemon Chikatsugu, and resided in Nakazawa Anayama. Later, during the Tenshō years, he served under our lord Danjō-no-chū Masanao-kun, and then served Higo-no-kami Tadamitsu-kun, performing the duties of magistrate at Takatō Castle in Shinshū. In his later years he retired and was granted an emergency stipend of fifty koku. His eldest son Kichibei inherited his father Chikatsugu's house, was granted a stipend of 250 koku, and served both Tadamitsu-kun and Doshin Shin-kun.

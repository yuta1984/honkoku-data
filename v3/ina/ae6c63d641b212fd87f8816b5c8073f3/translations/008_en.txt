Document of Submission

Our predecessor Kato Shinbei, in the 5th year of Bunsei (1822), year of the Horse, had accumulated debts to your household. Through the mediation of Kanaya Kichibei and Fujiya Kankichi, he pledged his house and property as collateral and arranged for repayment over five years. However, after Shinbei's death, there was no successor, and the property remained vacant for some time. Furthermore, in the 5th year of Tenpo (1834), year of the Horse, the house and property were destroyed by fire. Since your household could not rebuild, you transferred the land to the town district, and the town officials consulted together and kindly constructed new buildings for us, for which we are deeply grateful.

I wish to inherit and continue Shinbei's position. For this purpose, I have once again petitioned Ikegami Kichibei and Ito Jiemon regarding the borrowed money, making repeated requests. Through their extraordinary consideration, they have dedicated the promissory note to Tenno Shrine, and I have gratefully received what both gentlemen have handed over to me this time.

Therefore, I will offer prayers before the deity. I submit this document for future reference. Thus it is written.

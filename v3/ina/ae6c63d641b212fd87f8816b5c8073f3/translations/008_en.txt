Document of Submission

Our predecessor Kato Shinbei incurred substantial borrowed money from your household in the 5th year of Bunsei, year of the Horse. Through the mediation of Kanaya Kichibei and Fujiya Kankichi, he pledged his house and property as collateral and established a 5-year installment plan for repayment. However, after Shinbei's death, there was no successor, and the matter was suspended for some time. Furthermore, in the 5th year of Tenpo, year of the Horse, the house and property were destroyed by fire. Since your household could not rebuild, you transferred the said land to the town district, and through consultation with the town officials, construction and repairs were graciously undertaken, for which we are most grateful.

I wish to inherit Shinbei's position and fulfill my duties. To this end, I have repeatedly petitioned Ikegami Kichibei and Ito Jiuemon regarding the borrowed money and made various requests for assistance. Through your extraordinary consideration, you have dedicated the aforementioned sealed document to Tenno Shrine, and I have now received it from both gentlemen with sincere gratitude.

Therefore, I shall offer prayers before the deity. I submit this document for future reference. Thus as stated.

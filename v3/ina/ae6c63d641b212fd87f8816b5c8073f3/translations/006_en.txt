Since we are to inherit Shinbei's succession, we humbly requested that the house and residential lot be transferred to us. The town officials graciously agreed, and we have now received the transfer, for which we are deeply grateful. Under these circumstances, we shall pay one bu and two shu in gold annually as service fees to the administrative office. We have received your generous care thus far, and furthermore, you have transferred both the land and house construction to us. We shall never forget this deep benevolence through generations of our descendants. Of course, no matter what circumstances may arise in the future, we shall never use this house and residential lot as collateral or security.

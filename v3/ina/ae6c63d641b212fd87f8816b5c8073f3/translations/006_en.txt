Since I, Kenzaemon, have come to inherit Shinbei's estate, I humbly requested that the house and residential lot be transferred to me. The town officials graciously consented, and I have now received the property transfer, for which I am deeply grateful. In return, I shall pay one bu and two shu of gold annually as service fees to the administrative office. Having received such generous care until now, and moreover being granted this land and house construction, I shall never forget this profound kindness for generations to come. Naturally, no matter what circumstances may arise in the future, I pledge never to use this house and residential lot as collateral for loans.

As future evidence, this pledge is hereby submitted.

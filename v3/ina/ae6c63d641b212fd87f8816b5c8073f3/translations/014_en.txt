Through your gracious consideration, you granted us the aforementioned house and residential plot, for which we are deeply grateful, and we have been in possession of it. However, during the land certificate reform in Meiji 6 (1873), it was inconvenient for it to be in our names, so Mr. Ikegami Honei and Mr. Ito Eizo, both gentlemen, kindly accepted and held the land certificate for us, which we deeply appreciate as the generous kindness of both parties. We wished to possess it permanently, but recently Ito Kyuzo approached us wanting to receive the transfer of the house and land based on previous circumstances. When we consulted with the former officials, they gave their approval. Therefore, as consideration for the transfer, we have properly received thirty yen, which is correct. Under these circumstances, we shall not dispute matters concerning the residential plot in the future. Therefore, regarding the request to rewrite the land certificate for transfer to Kyuzo,

both parties will make the application on our behalf, and regardless of what may happen in the future, we ourselves will come forward to explain, and will not cause the slightest trouble to either party. This certificate is issued for future reference, therefore as stated herein.

Meiji 13 (1880)

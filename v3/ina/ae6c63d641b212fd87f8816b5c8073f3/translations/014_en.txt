Through your generous consideration, you granted us the aforementioned house and residential plot, which we gratefully possessed. However, during the land certificate reform of Meiji 6 (1873), it was inconvenient under our names, so Ikegami Motoe and Ito Eizo, both gentlemen, graciously took custody of the land certificate on our behalf. We are deeply grateful for the generous kindness of both parties. We had intended to possess it permanently, but recently Ito Kyuzo approached us with a proposal to transfer the house and land to him based on previous arrangements. We consulted with the former officials, and they gave their approval. Therefore, as consideration for the transfer, we have properly received thirty yen, which is genuine. Under these circumstances, we will not dispute the residential plot in the future. Therefore, regarding the transfer to Kyuzo and the application to rewrite the land certificate, please make the application on behalf of both parties. Whatever matters may arise in the future, we will come forward ourselves and will not cause any trouble whatsoever to both parties. This certificate is for future reference, thus as stated above.

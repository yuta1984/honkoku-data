Certificate of Transfer

Regarding the house and residential lot possessed by my predecessor Kato Shinbei, in the 5th year of Bunsei era (1822), as he had debts to Mr. Fujiya Tojuemon, he had placed the house and residential property as collateral. After Shinbei's death, negotiations were suspended for a while, and furthermore, due to a fire that spread in the 5th year of Tempo, Horse year (1834), the property became vacant land. As a result, it became difficult for the Tojuemon family to fulfill various town duties, so they transferred the land to the town district. After consultation among the town officials, through the efforts of the officials in the 2nd year of Kaei, Rooster year (1849), a house was constructed and even the Tenno Shrine was established there.

Subsequently, as I inherited Shinbei's estate, I gradually made requests to the town officials, and through their generous consideration, they transferred the house and residential property to me, which I gratefully possessed.

During the land certificate reform in the 6th year of Meiji (1873), as it was inconvenient to use my name, the land certificate was issued under the names of Mr. Ikegami Motoe and Mr. Ito Eizo. Recently, Ito Kyuzo requested to purchase the residential land based on previous arrangements. After consulting with all parties involved, they agreed, and I have properly received 30 yen.

Therefore, as the land will be transferred to Mr. Kyuzo, I hereby return the house to the town district. I will never cause any disputes in the future. This certificate is issued for future reference.

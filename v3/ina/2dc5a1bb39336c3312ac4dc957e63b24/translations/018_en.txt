When inquired by the town officials, a person named Yohei from within the group stated that although the aforementioned Wakichi is Bansuke's nephew, his attitude is unsatisfactory and it would be difficult to allow him to inherit the family headship. He had been saying this regularly, and already last spring he had said that Wakichi should be sent back. Regarding making him an adopted son, that matter aside, first there should be someone to arrange care as before, and that matter was left as is - there were frequent discussions about this when Bansuke was alive. The group leader Kozaemon also stated the same, as reported by the town officials. Regarding you (Magozo), they reported that as long as Bansuke's succession is established, there would be no complaints. Based on this, arrangements should be made according to the widow's wishes, and a suitable person should be found as an adoptee to establish Bansuke's succession. This directive should be understood.

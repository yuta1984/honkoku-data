Hokomotimachi
Bansuke's widow

Your husband Bansuke died of illness
last December, and since then the succession
has not been established, which is lamentable. When consulting
with Bansuke's relatives, regarding Bansuke's
nephew named Wakichi, who had been
taken in and cared for previously, and for whom there were
trusted connections during Bansuke's lifetime,
Bansuke's younger brother Magozo from Kamitonoshima village
strongly urged that he should be made an adopted son to establish the succession.
However, even during Bansuke's lifetime,
this did not accord with his wishes, and he repeatedly stated
that family succession would be difficult...

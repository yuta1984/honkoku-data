We attempted reconciliation, but since they absolutely refuse to consent, there is nothing more we can do about this matter. We have no choice but to report this to you. We humbly request that you please render judgment so that Bansuke's household may somehow be maintained. Properly speaking, we should return home and consult with Bunemon before making this petition, but since the round trip takes time and we are short-handed, it would be troublesome to come again to make our request, so we have no choice but to petition you now. Please note that Bunemon also mentioned when he came here that he had no intention of having someone whom the elder sister does not approve of inherit the family. Should you have any inquiries about the details, we would be pleased to explain them orally as well. The above.

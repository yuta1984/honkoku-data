Although this differs greatly from what you claim,
it is a reasonable argument
with documentary evidence,
and without any disputes, it is difficult to refute this claim.
Of course, as long as Bansuke's
succession is established, that would be good,
so regarding this matter, I also
inquired in advance with
Bansuke's guild
members, and since their views were
the same as your argument, I have
approved the petition as requested.
Regarding Wakichi's matter, I will handle it
according to your wishes, seek out a suitable adoptee
to establish the succession, and thoroughly
arrange that in the blacksmith profession,
if this comes to pass,
half of the customer base will go to the adoptee

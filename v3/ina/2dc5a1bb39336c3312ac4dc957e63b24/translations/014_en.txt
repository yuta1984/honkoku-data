strongly urged, but from Bansuke's lifetime
this did not accord with his wishes, and he repeatedly
stated that family succession would be difficult.
Regarding the aforementioned Wakichi, since he also
did not meet your wishes,
the blacksmith tools and customer base
were handed over, and some money was also
given to him, so that he could conduct business in a house he owns
within the same town. For Bansuke's
succession, a suitable person should be
adopted to carry on the inheritance.
Regarding this petition, when I ordered
a written response to be sent to Magozo,
although it differs greatly from what you claim,
it is a reasonable argument
with documentary evidence...

Magozo's thinking was that since Hansuke's nephew Wakichi had been mentioned by Hansuke during his lifetime, he wanted Wakichi to inherit. As for myself, it is true that last spring Hansuke had expressed such intentions, but afterwards, this Wakichi is still immature and I have repeatedly stated that he is quite unreliable as a successor, and such circumstances exist. Moreover, regarding Wakichi, since he does not meet my expectations, I would like to search for a suitable person elsewhere, or if there is no suitable person in the same trade, it cannot be helped, so even if we change businesses, I want to establish the household in some way. Of course, since Wakichi is my nephew right before my eyes, I have absolutely no intention of abandoning him. I plan to give him the house and property we have possessed in the same town, as well as blacksmith tools, patron relationships, and capital, to establish his profession, and then consult about other matters. Shogoro also consulted with Magozo about various things. However, since no decision could be reached, Shogoro would return to Edo and also inform ■■【ink blot】Bunemon, and then continue consultations. When we inquired of Magozo about the reasons for the delay until now, he said that if Hansuke had expressed such strong intentions during his lifetime, the succession should have been carried out immediately upon his death, so why couldn't a decision be made?

Regarding the above matter: after the famine of Kyōhō 18, Year of the Water Ox, when epidemics spread, publication was ordered through the town magistrate's office, and copies were distributed to villages in the shogunal domains. This matter concerns the time when epidemics were spreading in villages throughout the provinces, and common people were suffering hardships from poisoning by eating various foods. Since the medicinal prescription documents that were distributed to villages in Kyōhō 18, Year of the Ox, have likely been lost in many villages due to the passage of many years, copies should now be circulated to villages by domain lords and local administrators for the sake of relief.
　The above matter should be announced.
　　　Fifth month

　Since it is not easy to make handwritten copies to show to all the people, and to ensure there are no errors or omissions, this is published within the domain so that even women and children can read it easily. Therefore, it is written with phonetic notation and widely distributed to all villages.

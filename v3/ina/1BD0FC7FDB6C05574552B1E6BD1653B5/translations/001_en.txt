We have respectfully read your esteemed letter of the 5th day.
We are most delighted to hear that the Shogun continues to be in excellent health and spirits.

Regarding the matter of Gayain Gon-Sōjō (provisional high priest), who is a member of the Shōgoin temple family: after being appointed to the Shōgoin temple family, he fell ill and was unable to present his formal thanks. Therefore, he wishes to travel down to Edo this time to request an audience with the Shogun. We understand that he has consulted with various temple families and everyone, and has received your guidance on this matter.

Accordingly, when we reported this matter to the Rōjū (Senior Councilors), we were told that instructions would be given to us regarding what Gayain should be informed of. Therefore, we have been instructed that the monk should make his inquiry regarding this matter. We acknowledge the contents of your thoughtful letter.

With utmost respect and humility,

1. Regarding the Suspended Trees (Kake-gi)
The formal suspended trees are cherry, willow, cockscomb tree, and pine.
The spacing between trees may be up to 2 jō 2-3 shaku. In ancient times,
there were extremely wide gardens, but such gardens do not exist nowadays. However,
the size of the trees should be adjusted according to the width of the garden.
For narrow gardens, the spacing between trees may be
1 jō 8-9 shaku. However, spacing narrower than 2 jō deviates from proper form
and should only be planted as a simplified arrangement when unavoidable.

1. Regarding Planting Arrangements
For a south-facing garden, plant cherry in the ushi-tora (northeast), willow in the tatsu-mi (southeast),
cockscomb tree in the hitsuji-saru (southwest), and pine in the inu-i (northwest). They should be planted in this arrangement.
There are reasons for the planting arrangements of other orientations such as east-facing, west-facing, and north-facing gardens.
However, regardless of which direction it faces, like south-facing gardens,
one should plant with that direction as the foundation, and
this is not a difficult matter.

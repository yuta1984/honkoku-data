General Outline of Kemari Rules and Regulations

1. Garden Construction
There are two types of gardens: spacious and narrow. According to proper dimensions, aside from building the residence with the kake (trees) as the foundation, there should be no such distinction. Therefore, in recent times, the size of the garden is calculated accordingly based simply on the residence. The original intention for gardens is that being square should be the foundation of the ground layout. However, since it must conform to the residence, one side may be narrow while another is wide. It should be determined according to these circumstances. Although there are detailed rules for garden construction, generally it is good if the ground has no elevation differences and the soil is soft without stones, regardless of its condition. In general, garden construction should be decided upon to a reasonable degree, and trees should be planted first. If you level the terrain first and then plant the trees afterward, it may damage the garden. There is oral tradition regarding this.

Article 1: Regarding the height of the ball
The height at which a person kicks the ball is like the difference between a master archer and a poor one—
it does not depend entirely on dedication but is sometimes
a matter of natural ability. Generally, the ball's height is one jō and five shaku, so
one should have a general understanding of this. However, this does not mean that when kicking the ball
one must always match this exact measurement.
There should be variations depending on the occasion. Moreover, under trees or
under eaves, it should depend on the location. There should be further
oral instruction.

Using bamboo poles of two to three shaku as temporary plantings is a secret teaching. Also, willow is a tree with weak vital energy, and when left exposed to rain and dew, lacquer should be applied to the cut surfaces. When parts decay and split, it is the established method to nail boards over them and apply lacquer. For other trees, applying lacquer excessively should definitely be avoided. Also, planting smaller trees of the same kind as additions is the usual practice. When tree roots interfere and cause difficulty for kemari play, they are called "tō" - round wood is cut short and placed in the soil between two or three trees, following established precedent. Regarding the spacing between suspension trees: for large trees it is two jō two shaku (though formally three shaku), normally two shaku, and when the garden is narrow with few trees, one jō eight shaku would be appropriate.

The spacing between trees from the mist pillar is normally one jō five shaku. Two jō also has its natural precedent. Such master practitioners have all disappeared without trace, and we no longer see the famous suspension arrangements of recent times. The cockscomb tree at Sanmai Sōbō and the cherry tree at Kitabatake were truly magnificent famous trees, but they have all withered away. Now only the pine at Kawaraya remains. This excellent tree has been a truly modest pine since ancient times. This way should indeed flourish for a thousand years.

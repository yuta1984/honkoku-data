1. On the Origins
The Oral Tradition Collection states that "kemari (kickball) originated in distant foreign lands across vast blue waves and spread to the imperial domain of nine avenues." Tracing its source, it began in the time of the Yellow Emperor, taking the form of the head of one called Sui, as recorded in ancient texts. The Essential Summary states that "it was transmitted to our country during the reign of Empress Kogyoku." Emperor Tenji first played kemari, and Taishokkan (Fujiwara no Kamatari) began practicing it. Thereafter, even holy sovereigns watched it, as recorded in the Tale of Genji. Among court nobles, the beginning of skillful play was Chamberlain and Major Counselor Narimitsu; among commoners, the peerless master was Kamo Shrine Chief Narute. Kemari began in the Asuka-i house with Counselor Masatsune, and in the Naniwa house with Third Rank Ienaga. Our current school received the imperial instruction from Retired Emperor Go-Toba through Middle Counselor and Major Counselor Iie of the Nakain house. As we are now in the fifth generation and depend on this hereditary family profession, we do not feel shame from contemporary mockery.

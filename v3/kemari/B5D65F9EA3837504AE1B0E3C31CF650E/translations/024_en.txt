On days when kemari (kickball) is performed, whether wearing sokutai (court dress), nōshi (court robe), or kariginu (hunting robe), one should not carry a hinoki fan but should carry a gomyō fan instead. In spring and winter alike, the hi-ōgi (sun fan) should be omitted. Even on non-kemari days, if there are gatherings, it is good to carry summer fans with formal attire in spring and winter. At such enjoyable formal ceremonies, one must always insert a fan. This is also done when wearing hōi (cloth court dress) or suikan (informal court dress). According to proper form, when about to play kemari, one sits properly and inserts the fan, then stands from the seated position and approaches the hanging point, walking while inserting the fan, and again inserts it under the hanging point - explaining three times. Inserting the fan while walking must be the technique of a supreme master. When Kamo Hōkyū demonstrated this teaching, there were people who mocked him. There are three schools of fan insertion: like inserting a sword, like yanagigashi, and like inserting a shaku (court baton) - these three schools have their respective protocols. Insertion is the standard ceremony. There are three methods of hand movements for insertion: extending hands behind from under both sleeves, taking the fan in the right hand and passing it over, engaging the obi with the left hand and inserting it tilting slightly to the right. Insert it up to where the fan ribs and paper meet, then extend the left hand from under the sleeve and the right hand from above the sleeve to the back for insertion. Also, extend the left hand from above the sleeve and the right hand from under the sleeve to the back. These three schools are each used according to preference.

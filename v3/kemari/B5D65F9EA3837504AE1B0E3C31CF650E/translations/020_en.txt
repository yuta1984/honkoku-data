This too is the duty of a person from a hereditary family of this way. It should be the next role after the ceremonial opening kick. The procedure is as follows: after the dew-clearing kemari is finished (the dew-clearing kemari should be completed), the person with this role advances and approaches the branch, going to the base of the ball (the branch should be leaned against a folding screen or standing blind). If the host is seated on the right side, one first strikes the right side, squats down, takes the base of the branch with the right hand, raises it from the left knee, turns clockwise toward the lower seat direction, and squats between two posts (kneeling from the left knee). With the left hand, one stands the branch upright in the ground, immediately places the base of the branch under the left sleeve, presses it to the ground, and lowers the ball from the branch. With the right hand alone, one unties the twisted paper cord attached to the ball and puts it in one's breast pocket (straightening the hunting robe, putting it in the front bulge). While still supporting and pushing the branch with the left hand, one takes the ball's leather strap with the right hand, wraps it around the left hand, rises leaning on the left knee, walks out into the center of the four posts, squats down, and in the proper position places the ball with its tied end facing toward oneself and the leather strap on top, then turns clockwise and takes the branch in a withdrawing manner, carrying it toward the left rear. When there are two attached balls, the method changes, and one takes the branch and walks out...

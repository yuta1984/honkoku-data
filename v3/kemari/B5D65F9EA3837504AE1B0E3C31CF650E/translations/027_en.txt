There are also explanations, but since one is accustomed to the proper way of holding the ball, this would be most appropriate. The base of the branch should be shaved one sun and five bu toward the ball's binding point. There is also an explanation about cutting from above with a blade, but this is not necessarily required. Two are made on one branch. Up to three are not attached.

When attaching another ball, about one shaku above that branch, attach it to the back of the original ball. Also, the branches and attachment methods should differ between balls for days of untying and days of not untying, but such distinctions are not so difficult to discern.

Take a paper twist, pass it through a hole in the nearby leather binding without making even one knot, immediately hang the attached branch on the core branch, and cut the naniwanawa cord to one sun in length, with the end of the paper twist cut to two sun on the pulling side and three sun on the non-pulling side. This is the attachment method for balls on days of untying.

What we call balls for days of not untying refers to ceremonial gift balls, or when sending them to someone's residence. Though there are variations, first the tip of the paper twist should be cut to the same measurement of three sun. This paper twist has thorough oral teachings and should be handled with care. The joint should be cut crosswise to one sun, and with a fukusa cloth, the twisted portion should be made clear, and rice paste should be kneaded thoroughly toward the inner side. This is an extremely important matter. Also, three or five balls are never attached to branches.

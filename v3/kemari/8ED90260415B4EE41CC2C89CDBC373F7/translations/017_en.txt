One may also kick the ball to a person positioned behind and kick it into the hanging area. The proper form is for oneself to pass through the opposite tree and circle around the outside of the hanging area. However, during moments of heightened interest, one may kick outside the trees two or three times, making the people standing at the base of the trees exert effort, and having the person in direction-positioning also devote loyalty in kicking - this is one principle. Also, for people of established virtue or nobles performing direction-positioning, there is no problem even if they do not necessarily circle around the outside of the trees. Furthermore, if the person in direction-positioning makes an error and passes straight through the base of the opposite tree to return to their own position, this must not happen.

1. On Field-Lying (No-bushi)
The rules state: "When eight skilled players have the proper mindset, there should be one or two field-lying players." One should stand behind a high-ranking person whose kemari footwork is not excellent, or behind an elderly person whose walking may not be as intended. There is also a theory about standing behind the space between people. One must not stand behind trees. Since this has not occurred recently, I cannot record the details. This is merely so that people of later generations will know that such things existed.

1. On Requesting
When one wishes to kick, one bows and requests the ball.

"Behold each of their types," and as one child raised his face, there were characters reading "Spring Willow Flowers" on his forehead. Another child had the characters "Summer Peaceful Grove" on his forehead, and yet another child had "Autumn Orchid" written on his forehead. All these characters were written in gold. When Lord Narimichi saw this, he became even more chilled to the bone, and the child said: "We are beings who dwell in the shade of willows and in places where the water is pure and cool. Call upon each of our names, and we will all come eagerly to serve you. From now on, you must not play kemari in the garden. Palace service separated from trees is a matter of immeasurable importance. Henceforth, we shall become your ancient protectors." Saying this, they vanished as if dissolving away. Afterward, that noble felt both amazed and deeply faithful, and upon careful consideration, he realized that "Yang Hua" (willow flowers) written meant "yaku" (misfortune), "An Lin" (peaceful grove) written meant "ari" (ants), and "Ran" (orchid) written meant the sound "wo." The forms governing these three seasons were unprecedented and rare, something that would be difficult to express even in words. Regarding this passage, even those who might see it regularly must absolutely not speak of it to others. Though there are many fears and reservations, I record this to dispel the doubts of future generations.

This matter should not depend on practice alone, but one should first learn the precedents and then observe the behavior of attendants in formal occasions to learn from them. However, there are also things that should be corrected in advance. In kemari (kickball), there is something called "kishoku" (demeanor/atmosphere). The rules state that "those under thirty need not walk around." No matter how skilled one is, one should become a passive "ground hand." Similarly, it says "one should maintain a spirit like the night palace" - appearing calm on the surface while maintaining a quick spirit within.

It also states: "On days when ignorant monks or court ladies are watching, one should kick the ball frequently and run around the playing field. From time to time, one should look into the curtained area and laugh." While running around frequently with the ball may be acceptable, looking into the curtained area and laughing is truly uncouth. The above seems rather questionable and amusing. Also, it is important to carefully observe and judge one's assigned ball. When two people do not coordinate their requests, one should request again. When intending to have someone else kick, one should follow the people on the left and right and pull at one's sleeves. One should not stand with father and child on the same side, nor beside the trees. Also, one should appreciate the trees on the eaves side. This is where the highest-ranking nobles and dignitaries stand. Whether advancing or returning to one's seat, when returning from the far end to the original hanging position, even when going around the outside of the trees, one must not pass behind the most honored person of the day.

Beauty is a separate matter entirely. No matter how much one tries to correct bad habits, flaws such as hip positioning, chest posture, foot height, and knee bending are difficult to correct regardless of effort. Even if a person of high rank does not hit the ball with great precision every time, if their posture and form are beautiful and they kick cleanly for two or three touches, it would be admirable. Difficult footwork under trees or kicking the ball far away would be wonderful if done easily, but if performed in an exaggerated, expansive manner, the foot positioning would become awkward. However, if a person of lower rank, despite having the habit of raising their feet high in an unsightly manner, can execute precise footwork, they may be called upon to play even in games with many mediocre players, setting aside those of higher rank. One should behave with awareness of the distinctions between high and low status.

While one should not strain excessively, it is not necessarily good for one's costume and family crests to remain perfectly undisturbed like an artificial Buddha statue. It is precisely during various difficult footwork techniques like flying kicks and return kicks that the crests become disheveled, yet to conduct oneself beautifully throughout, then retreat deep into the shade of trees to adjust one's appearance, appears ostentatious.

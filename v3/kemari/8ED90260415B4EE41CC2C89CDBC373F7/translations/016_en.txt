One steps forward and kicks three or four times, then enters beneath the kick and adjusts one's clothing - this appears very graceful. When one person kicks in the proper center of the four trees, the remaining seven people should stand without gaps at the base of their respective trees. When the ball goes outside the trees, if one person pursues it and takes charge, the remaining seven people move slightly. This form should be visible in the kemari diagrams. Also, in direction measures (mukō-tsume), one must never position oneself outside the trees. In layered positioning (kasane-tsume), one should position oneself four to five shaku closer. When the ball catches on the southeast (tatsumi) corner, one person among the two at the northwest (inui) position centers himself, positions closely, and kicks. He exits through the base of the southeast tree, and when the sequence ends, moves to the base of the northwest tree in the original seating area. The ball should pass through the space between this southeast tree and the person waiting there. It should pass between people. In layered positioning, one again approaches and kicks. When facing the southeast tree and positioning to kick, the person standing at the base of the tree enters deeply. The person to the north of the southern good position approaches about one jō, and should position closer than the person standing at the western corner (southwest corner), extending to their west. The person standing to the east of that position does the same. Also, the true intention of direction positioning is to receive the ball kicked from the base of the position and pass it on to layered positioning as well...

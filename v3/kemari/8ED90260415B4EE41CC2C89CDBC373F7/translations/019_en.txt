The ball rolled to the base of the lamp stand. The Major Counselor thought this strange and set down his brush to observe this phenomenon. What he saw was a three or four-year-old child with a bald head, but whose body, hands, and feet were those of a monkey. Together with the ball, before returning, it approached close to the Major Counselor and said: "Do not be surprised or alarmed. I have come here because there is something I must tell you. Since ancient times, there have been many people who have loved kemari, but none have achieved such accomplishments as yours. I have come to congratulate you on receiving various rewards for today's concluding kemari ceremony. I shall explain the circumstances and state my purpose: Those who love kemari through the generations will see their countries prosper, their official positions advance, and this becomes a connection for the afterlife."

At that time, the noble asked: "That countries prosper and official ranks advance may well be so, but isn't it going too far to say it becomes a connection to enlightenment?" The child answered: "Truly, you may have such doubts, but in a person's daily life, they think about various matters countless thousands and tens of thousands of times. All of this becomes an obstruction to the afterlife. However, those who stand in the kemari court think of nothing but kemari. They never think of anything that might be harmful to others. Therefore, naturally their sinful karma becomes lighter and it becomes a connection to liberation from suffering - this should dispel your doubts."

Since Kawarain has expertise in craftsmanship and precedent, they produce superior quality balls. They are made by combining thick materials from two pastures. Making one ball from one pasture results in poor balance. Smoked balls are made from the flower season until the leaves wither, making them suitable for the season of use. Regarding sewing methods, both the needle marks and all five leather pieces should be visible. The binding leather should be of the same color.

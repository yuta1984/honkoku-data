When observing the situation, if that person yields their position according to the request of someone of lower rank, it goes without saying this is acceptable. If this is not the case, one has no choice but to stand in that location. When the shogun stands, everyone should move from their seats. The same applies when an elder stands, and when a master stands.

One: On the Three Stages
Kemari should have jo-ha-kyū (introduction-development-climax). Initially, one should stand deep under the tree, and according to one's rank, keep the ball low and restrained, taking special care to distinguish well between one's own and others' roles, kicking gently.

This should be the jo (introductory) stage. In the ha (development) stage, one should move slightly away from under the tree, keep the ball height moderate, and occasionally incorporate artistic techniques while kicking. In the final phase, when it reaches the kyū (climax) stage, one should increase the number of kicks without letting the ball touch the tree, still keeping the ball height restrained, with everyone dedicating themselves fully and building excitement. Continuously making clear the distinction between self and others, each adding vocal expressions, and while maintaining proper deportment without disorder, one should kick vigorously.

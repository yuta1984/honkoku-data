○Another story of an actress advancing from Sennett's ranks,
Virginia Warwick appeared in Metro's special production
"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" starring 
Rudolph Valentino. She joined Sennett fifteen months ago
and after appearing in Fox Sunshine comedies, appeared in
Four Horsemen, so her advancement is quite rapid, but
there's still some distance before she becomes like
Swanson or Lake. Incidentally, this film is a major
production directed by Rex Ingram.

○Monte Blue, recognized as possessing light and solid
acting style in "The Actress and the Soldier," will appear
as Mary Miles Minter's leading man in the Realart film
"Moonlight and Honeysuckle."
○Likewise, Bebe Daniels' leading man for Realart has been
decided as Harry Meyers, and Wanda Hawley's leading man
has been chosen as T. Roy Barnes.
○When Wallace Reid appeared at the opening ceremony of
the new Capitol Theatre, his popularity was reportedly
greater than that of the Prince of Wales.
○Elsie Ferguson of Paramount, who recently completed
"Sacred and Profane Love," will now produce "Footlights"
at Paramount's Eastern studio under the direction of
John S. Robertson, director of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."
○The director for Douglas's "The Three Musketeers" had
been under consideration for some time, but it appears
Fred Niblo has been selected. Niblo was previously a
director of Douglas films. "Sex," currently showing at
D company, is also directed by him.

　　Various Matters (The Value of Film Drama)
　　　　　　　　　Uchida Tokuji
　　　　　　　　　　　
　The value of film drama concerns the problem of how
　deeply that film (I use the word "film" to specifically
　represent film drama throughout this essay) penetrates
　us. In other words, it is a question of how truthfully
　the film itself expresses true society (I dare call it
　that).

[Page 5 Lower Section]

　"Be thoroughly rich in content," but content itself
　is the work of truthful depiction, not plot-driven
　external elements within a story.
　"It is true reproduction born from creation"
　I think.
　And the world being reproduced is nothing other than
　the world of content itself. The value of film is
　a selected and depicted world, and its high or low
　value is directly proportional to the true depth or
　shallowness of the depicted world regarding certain
　phenomena, not the superiority or inferiority of
　the treated world.

　　On Excellent Films　(Three)
　　　　　　　　　Akiyama Katsuji

Next is "Why Change Your Wife." It is an artistic
crystallization composed by DeMille's directorial skill
and actors like Elliott Dexter and Gloria Swanson
under his command, each giving their best performance.
I don't say that famous directors and actors always
show excellent skill. However, when looking back at
this film, the value of cinematic intersection emerges,
beginning with the thoughts the film brings.
Finally, I want to say a word about "Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde." Though it's called a stage adaptation,
I recommend it as an excellent film. Sheldon Lewis
previously made the same film called "The Horror of
Darkness," but it wasn't well-received by the public.
This is certainly due to advertising, but regarding
stage actors and cinema... Reading the various essays
published so far repeatedly, I feel great irony. (End)

　　　　From Blackton's Films
　　　　　　　　　　　　Kazuki Hideo

　His films are dreamlike poetry. They don't forget
light humor and wit while cleverly satirizing life.
There are no sudden climactic scenes, but they are
gradually sung, becoming increasingly passionate,
and afterwards the lingering echoes reverberate in
valleys and disappear again, making one suddenly
realize and recall like tracing a dream, bringing
back memories of Bluebird Pictures' golden age.
He frequently uses beautiful scenery as backgrounds
for emotional expression. Unlike Turner's very
conspicuous style—not mere amateur-oriented—it is
more quiet and impressive. The fog scene in "The
Man by the Roadside" is one of the unforgettable ones.
The skillful and calm depiction of the psychological
process of the passionate gypsy's lovelorn man in
"Flames of Passion," and the extremely skillful
portrayal of the fool in "The Forbidden Valley"—
who despite his foolishness uses quite wicked means
for love—are truly the result of his accomplished
direction. He lacks DeMille's minute and penetrating
technique, nor can one glimpse the lavish stage
settings of Fitzmaurice or Weber, but like Stroheim's
work, the personalities of the characters are clear,
without incomprehensible characters that would greatly
diminish dramatic interest, and the drama is unified
in beautiful picture-like scenes through the elegant
and poetic atmosphere that Wider possesses.

　　　Rambling Thoughts
　　　　　　　　　Ushigome　Seihōsei

　I dare say "The sensitivity of those involved toward
motion pictures is too dull, or too apt to underscore
their own incompetence." Indeed, the current state of
this field is extremely mediocre, and how can one
entrust all hopes to contemplation and silent
reflection for improvement............ It should be
called a great lamentable matter.
　The sight of those gasping for breath, dreaming of
packed houses in the middle of the sixth district,
showing off with exaggerated appearances and being
obsessed with excessive profits, is laughably pathetic.
To catch two rabbits, there must be some reward
equivalent to meeting quantity with quantity.
　Audiences are honest. And the eye that watches
motion pictures has an accuracy transcending that of
those involved, so making non-artistic films into
fodder, or lining up tedious works with neither
substance nor flavor, then licking one's lips saying
"what fine prey we have here" is reckless behavior.
It's truly a fact that cannot escape criticism as
mediocre work after mediocre work.
　A certain weekly reported: "What's unsatisfactory
about recent pictures is that the authors, actors,
directors, technicians who compose films still lack
sufficient inspiration from magnificent natural beauty
and painful facts of human life. The completed pictures
lack poetic flavor. They try to value films with
financial power"...I sympathized...However, I believe
it's extremely difficult to apply these arguments to
every single released film from one to ten, and that
the aforementioned dissatisfaction can be overcome
to some degree by the spirit of those involved.
I mourn the mediocrity of films along with the decline
of music. Having stated this, even D must feel some
need for self-reflection.

　　Reviews of Theda Bara's "Salome"
　　　　(Five)　　　　　　Akiyama Katsuji

　Your body is whiter and more beautiful than the roses
from which Arabian queens make perfume, your hair is
black like clusters of black grapes in Eden's garden—
or like darkness where the pale moon hides and
frightened stars are extinguished, your mouth is
redder than the fully ripened pomegranate fruit
blooming in Nile gardens, redder than the coral
branches existing in the deep sea bottom where sunlight
never reaches even on clear days—these were the words
of praise that Salome bestowed upon the prophet John
when she first met him in the Judean wilderness.
I first declare that this film was a failed work.
Adrian Johnson probably adapted Wilde's original to
make it a Theda Bara film. Probably he became a
scenario writer with the greatest determination to
cinematize Wilde's masterpiece. If so, would audiences
who saw this "Salome" recommend it as having achieved
worthy dramatic—cinematic—effects not inferior to the
great Wilde's name—though falling short, at least
adequate? No, there we are forced to see several
breakdowns. I recently encountered John Barrymore's
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," which also faces loud
criticism as stage description, but "Salome" is even
more theatrical. The young Syrian Sejanne, seduced by
Salome's bewitching appearance, drowns the bathing
bishop David, and the scene where the king, Salome,
and Sejanne look at each other's faces before the
corpse is the most foolish display of this kind.

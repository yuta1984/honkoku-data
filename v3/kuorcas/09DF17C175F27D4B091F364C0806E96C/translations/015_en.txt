"There's no way forward. When father-in-law and I discussed this, if it were your heart's desire to sell the old woman (wife) to raise silver for expenses, we never imagined you had such hopes. Even if you had such thoughts, considering my parents' reputation, it might be difficult to speak of it. Rather than that, we decided to sell our daughter without telling you.

Furthermore, let me tell you of one item that serves as proof. When the old man wrapped those fifty ryō in a hand towel and put it in his bosom, I said, 'That's not safe. I should lend you a purse to hang around your neck.' That is, I lent him my

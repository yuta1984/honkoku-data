He held the sword together with his fist, pried open those many cotton stitches, and thrust down with full force. Kyudayu was below, wounded in the shoulder, flailing his limbs and tumbling about. Yuranosuke shouted: "Drag him up!"

Hearing this, Heiuemon immediately jumped down to the ground, roughly dragged out the blood-covered body and said: "This bastard Kyudayu, serves you right for this miserable state!" and threw him to the ground.

Yuranosuke grabbed Kyudayu's topknot, dragging him while saying: "This wretch is like what the Buddhist scriptures call 'the worm within the lion's body that devours its flesh and harms the lion' - just like you. You have received much stipend over generations and received enormous favors, yet you willingly became a spy for our enemies, spreading lies and falsehoods, turning truth upside down, making false reports, and informing them about us.

We forty-odd men have borne hunger and cold, separated from parents, parted from wives and children. Even wives who were companions from our youth have fallen into brothels. All solely to avenge our lord. Sleeping or waking, we think only of the calamity of our lord's seppuku, shedding tears of blood, crying in grief and sorrow, suffering anguish that tears apart our very organs.

Moreover, tonight is the monthly memorial of our deceased lord. Though I, Yuranosuke, strictly observe abstinence and avoid speaking impure words while maintaining deep reverence in my heart, you of all people came to tempt me with meat, trying to make me eat it. I could neither say yes nor say no - what choice did I have? The more I suffered and worried, when I took one bite and it passed my throat, my whole body suddenly became agitated, as if a bowl of hot iron liquid had been poured down. I felt as if all forty-four bones were shattered into ten thousand pieces in agony.

This damned perverse demon, this cursed evil spirit, kept pressing and pressing, continuously making my head spin, causing me to shed endless tears of blood."

Then he said to Heiuemon: "That I forgot the rusty sword earlier was Heaven's sign for me to cut him into pieces and make him suffer. You shall cut him shallowly and let him feel the pain."

Heiuemon respectfully agreed, drew his sword and sprang up.

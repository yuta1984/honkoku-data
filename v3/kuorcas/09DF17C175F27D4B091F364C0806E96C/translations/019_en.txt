"What did he say to you? Answer quickly. Why won't you respond? You should have no excuse. The evidence is right here."

So saying, she reached out her hand, thrust it into Kanpei's breast, and pulled something out, saying: "This purse that I glimpsed earlier clearly has bloodstains on it. Your father-in-law was killed by you."

Kanpei said in panic, "That's not true."

The mother said, "Even if you say it's not true, no matter how much you try to hide it, divine justice is clear. You killed your father-in-law and stole his money. Who did you think you were giving it to? Surely you saw that your father-in-law's household was poor and, thinking suspiciously, believed he would give you half the ransom money while embezzling the rest for his own use, and because he wouldn't agree to give you the full amount, you killed him and took it.

Until now I thought you were a man of integrity, but you were different from your appearance. I'm furious at being deceived by you - how can I calm this rage? You worthless scoundrel, you've left me so stunned that I can't even cry. Poor father-in-law - this beast-like son-in-law, when he was trying so hard to make you into the samurai you once were, this old man worked through the night, rushing to Kyoto, devising various schemes, preparing money to give to you, caring only for your welfare and taking great pains - yet you repaid his kindness with betrayal. This is truly like being bitten by the dog you've been feeding.

Seeing your acts of robbery and murder, you demon, you snake - quickly bring father-in-law back to life and return him to me, return the living old man to me!"

Without restraint, she grabbed that big man by the hair and pulled him close, beating his face mercilessly. "Even if you were chopped into mincemeat, it wouldn't satisfy my anger." She kept muttering complaints and fell to the ground, weeping bitterly.

Kanpei regretted his mistake, but his body burned like boiling water, sweating as if molten copper had been poured over him. Biting down on the mat, he finally realized: "Heaven is giving me immediate retribution."

At that moment, two samurai wearing woven hats appeared.

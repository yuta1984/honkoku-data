[Upper margin] This section depicts the courtesan's emotional state with great skill and clever direction.

"Being blown by the wind is fine. I have something I want to discuss with you. However, it's like being separated by the Milky Way, making it difficult to talk. Please come down in a little while."

Katsukaji said: "Then please wait a moment. I'll go around and come down."

Yuranosuke said: "If you come down by going around the stairs, what if the serving women see you and force you to drink, refusing to let you go? Oh, fortunately there's a ladder here. Come down right away by stepping on this."

He quickly placed the ladder against the eaves.

Katsukaji said: "I'm completely unaccustomed to such a ladder. Isn't it dangerous?"

Yuranosuke said: "Not at all, not at all. What danger is there to fear? When you were a young girl, you could stride three ken at a time and come down without worrying about splitting your legs - that was your age then."

Katsukaji said: "Don't talk nonsense. It's just like being on a ship, swaying and moving - it's terribly dangerous."

Yuranosuke said: "No wonder the ship's guardian deity has appeared."

Katsukaji said: "Stop it, don't peek."

Yuranosuke said: "I want to worship the autumn moon over Lake Dongting."

Katsukaji said: "If you say such things, I won't come down."

Yuranosuke said: "Come now, you're not like a virgin maiden. If you won't agree to come down, I'll help you down myself."

Katsukaji said: "Don't do anything improper."

Yuranosuke said: "What are you talking about? What's frightening about this?"

He immediately embraced her from behind and firmly helped her down, saying: "You did see the letter, didn't you?"

Katsukaji made excuses, saying she had never seen it.

Yuranosuke said: "Don't deny it - you must have seen it."

Katsukaji said: "It must be some kind of interesting love letter."

Yuranosuke sighed and said: "Now there's one more trouble."

Katsukaji said: "Since you had me come down, sir, if you have something to tell me, please let me hear it."

Yuranosuke said: "You ask what I have to tell you - you and I have known each other long and our feelings have ripened. I simply want to become husband and wife with you."

"...is not what one should do. I left my important sword with that man. I'll go get it. You should change the hanging scroll later and add charcoal to the brazier. But don't run through this room and step on the shamisen."

"Oh, Kutayu has gone back."

Again, a singing voice was heard in the garden:

"Calling father, calling daughter, harmonious calls frequent / One wonders if husband and wife together bind as親 / Who would expect the copied words of a parrot / Suddenly teaching the courtesan to wet her kerchief with tears"

Yuranosuke looked around in all directions, and taking advantage of the quiet night, he held the letter sent by a lady under the hanging lantern to examine it. Looking at it, he saw it contained detailed information about the enemy household, written minutely and precisely. It was indeed in a woman's handwriting, with ornate and beautiful prose, dotted and composed to make it readable. The content was somewhat comprehensible.

Katsukaji thought it was a love letter from somewhere and felt "truly envious." Looking from the upper floor, though the night moon was bright, somehow she couldn't see far. The characters appeared hazy and unreadable. She suddenly had an idea to use a mirror to reflect light on the characters to read them.

Kutayu had also hidden himself under the veranda, waiting for her to unfold the letter. He stretched out his hand to pull it down and grab it, then held it up to the moonlight to examine it.

Who could have known that while Katsukaji was leaning against the railing reading, unexpectedly a golden hairpin from her head fell with a clatter. Yuranosuke was startled and looked up to see someone on the upper floor. He hurriedly hid behind cover.

That Kutayu was still under the veranda, nodding to himself. Katsukaji had already been discovered; she turned away and quickly put away the mirror, then said in a contrived manner:

"Lord Yura!"

Yuranosuke said: "What are you doing up there on the floor above?"

Katsukaji said: "I was made drunk by you and passed out, so I had no choice but to let the wind blow on me to sober up."

Yuranosuke said:

[Upper margin note] A mirror is different from a telescope - there is no principle by which it could make distant objects clearly visible. This is where the author cleverly deceives foolish people.

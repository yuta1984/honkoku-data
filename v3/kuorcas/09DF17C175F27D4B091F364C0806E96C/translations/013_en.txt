"Since he serves in Lord Enya's mansion, I too need not worry about other matters," and there is a poem as evidence:

　　Born to become a servant in an official house　　When spring comes, returning to ancestors
　　Sending off and welcoming many guests　　　　　Not accustomed to calling myself "I"

While the mother and daughter were talking, from outside came the rough sounds of people carrying and setting down a palanquin. This was the proprietress of the Mojitei brothel in Gion district, who ran to the gate and said, "Is Yoichibei at home? No," and then ran straight forward.

The mother said, "You've walked such a long way to come here. Daughter, bring out the tobacco tray and serve tea." There was no time for proper greetings.

The proprietress said, "Your old man worked very hard last night. Did he return home safely?"

The mother replied, "Didn't he come back with you? He went to your place yesterday and hasn't returned until now. I truly don't understand."

The proprietress said, "Perhaps he was strolling in front of the Inari shrine and got enchanted by some story, but he's nowhere to be seen either. Actually, several days ago I came to this village to inspect your daughter and arranged her five-year contract price - I was supposed to pay one hundred ryō. We shook hands on it and made a clear agreement. Your old man told me, 'Tonight I must urgently return the silver,' promising to write a promissory note, begging me to hand over the contract money. He spoke while shedding tears profusely.

I had no choice but to let him write the contract and handed over half the payment. The remainder would be paid when I take the daughter - we agreed on this arrangement. The old man received fifty ryō and left in great joy. It was exactly the second watch (around 2 AM). I said the night was late with stars moving across the sky, and it wasn't good for him to return alone with the money, but he wouldn't listen, and I couldn't forcibly detain him. Surely something happened on the road."

Katsuko said, "Why don't you go check on other families?"

The mother said, "No such thing, no such thing! If he received the money, he should naturally have returned quickly to make the mother and daughter happy. This makes no sense at all, no sense at all!"

The proprietress said, "It makes no sense in a thousand or ten thousand ways. Your suspicions are your own affair and don't concern my business. I just want you to receive the silver and let me take the daughter home." So saying, she took out money from her bosom, and with these fifty ryō, making it one hundred ryō altogether, settled the payment.

The mother said, "That won't do. Even if that were the case, without waiting for that person (the old man) to return, how can I hand over my daughter? Katsuko, what do you think?" "It's not good to let you go."

The proprietress said, "This dilly-dallying shows no understanding at all. This is not a matter for arguing back and forth with you people. There is Yoichibei's seal, and this contract as evidence - I speak precisely on behalf of that old man.

The mother said, "How good that you've returned!" Seeing his mother's joy, Kanpei asked suspiciously.

"What circumstances are mother and this old woman discussing?" and sat down slowly.

The proprietress said, "You must be Katsuko's husband. Well then, this old gentleman here wrote a contract stating that he certainly cannot claim to be her husband, nor can he claim to be her fiancé. Here are the seal and promissory note. I have nothing to do with your domestic affairs. Quickly hand over the daughter."

The mother said to Kanpei, "You surely don't know the circumstances. The daughter overheard your usual talk about raising silver money and told her father about it. Because of this, we wanted to prepare silver to give you. No matter how we try to manage things, there's still no way to

Among human emotions, there are many forms of suffering, but none is more painful than separation in life.

The mother looked back once from behind to see her daughter off, then said, "Because I spoke of trivial matters, my daughter must surely be feeling sad and distressed." Then, turning to Kanpei, she said, "Even I, who am just the mother of a daughter, have been able to pull myself together, so you must not merely think obsessively about your wife and harm your mind and body. That old man - why hasn't he returned even now? You said you met your father-in-law this morning, but where did you meet him? Where did he go after parting with you?"

Kanpei said, "The place where we parted was around Toba, Fushimi, Yodo, and Takeda..." and he evaded the topic here and there, making things up as he spoke, lying and covering up the truth.

By then, three local hunters - Meppō Yahachi, Taneshima Roku, and Tanukikaku Hei - had already arrived, carrying the old father's corpse on a wooden door, covered with a straw raincoat, and brought it straight to the house, saying, "Last night in the mountains, when we were about to rest and head home, we found this old man murdered. So we companions brought him back."

Hearing this, the mother was shocked, her soul seeming to fade away, and she said, "Who could have committed such a violent act? Son-in-law, don't you know who the killer is? You must search for that criminal and avenge him."

Facing the corpse, she wailed loudly, saying, "Father-in-law, father-in-law," calling out countless times, but apart from her own lamenting voice, there was no response at all.

The hunters said in unison, "Old woman, how unfortunate. Quickly go to the magistrate's office to file a complaint, search for that criminal, and have him properly punished. We must now take our leave." The three men each returned to their homes.

The mother wiped away her tears and ran straight to Kanpei's side, questioning him with suspicion: "I never thought such a thing could happen, but this is strange. Even though you come from a samurai family, seeing your father-in-law in this condition, you should be shocked and grieved. Didn't you perhaps meet him on the road and receive money from him?"

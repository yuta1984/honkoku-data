Her beauty is buried in this village. Her elderly mother, leaning on a walking stick, returns step by step.

[Upper margin] The dialogue is interesting

The mother says: "My daughter has done her hair up beautifully. Now it's wheat harvest time everywhere, and everyone is busy gathering crops. Just now I could hear several young men singing folk songs at the threshing ground, singing 'Grandfather takes grandmother by the hand to celebrate the good harvest.' Hearing this song reminds me - waiting for your father-in-law and mother-in-law's delayed return, I went running to the outskirts earlier, and despite waiting for ages like the two Buddhas in nirvana, there's neither shadow nor trace of them."

Katsuko says: "I wonder why they're so late. Perhaps I should run and go look for them."

The mother says: "You're a young woman, so it's not good for you to walk alone. Originally you grew up in the countryside from childhood and were reluctant to go out and meet people. That's why we sent you to serve in Lord Enya's mansion, but you're still not free from these rustic country connections. It's just that seeing you and Kanpei come back here together, watching husband and wife blush when they meet, is unbearable."

Katsuko says: "Mother is right. Originally, to marry the man you love and grow old together in the countryside is beyond words. No matter how poor our life, throwing it all to the western sky, we think nothing of hardship. Eventually when the Bon festival comes, like in that folk song about the elderly couple taking each other's hands, I too will go with Lord Kanpei to watch the dancing there. I'm sure mother also remembers her youth. We can speak freely without reserve - such a clever woman I am."

The mother laughs and says: "Though you speak amusingly, it rather brings to mind the suffering in your heart."

Katsuko says: "How could there be any suffering? This too is selling my body for my husband's sake, going to Gion district to work as a courtesan. I always make such plans with this resolve in mind, but what saddens me is causing worry to my aging parents."

The mother says: "Stop such talk. Your brother, though of humble station, serves the same Lord Enya..."

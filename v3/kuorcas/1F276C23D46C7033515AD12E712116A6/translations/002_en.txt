Synopsis――In the mountains of Shinano there was a village called Shogi Valley, said to contain infinite gold. The village chief Yukitaro disappeared at age three due to a mysterious disappearance, and his betrothed Akemi wandered around Edo with her servant Ryuo Taro searching for Yukitaro.
　One night, a memorial grand shogi tournament for the late master Kaibara Jukichi was held at the villa of former Minami-machi magistrate Torii Kai-no-kami. Over thirty women were selected to participate, including Kai-no-kami's beloved concubine Lady Okaji, Akemi, and Okinu, daughter of police agent Hotoke no Yoshikichi. Among the prizes for the winner was the deceased Jukichi's memoir "Travel Diary," which contained the secrets of Shogi Valley.
　During the tense matches, a strange voice was heard, the room was plunged into darkness, and in the confusion the "Travel Diary" was torn in half and stolen by someone unknown, leaving behind the tragic corpses of two or three young women.

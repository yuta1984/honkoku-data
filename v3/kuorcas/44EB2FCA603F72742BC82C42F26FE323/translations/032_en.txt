Rain clears and spring garden grass holds mist　Where is that scenery where flowers seem ready to burst into flame

Before she could cry out, he drew his sword from its scabbard, cut off her topknot, snatched the divorce papers, bundled them together, and fled away swiftly. No one knew where he had gone.

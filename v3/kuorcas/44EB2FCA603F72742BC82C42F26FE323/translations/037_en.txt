They placed bamboo poles from the upper crossbeam to the lower crossbeam and cut through all the strings at once. Both crossbeams loosened, and the door panels fell to the ground. Yuranosuke quickly shouted to everyone, chanting the two characters "Tenga" as they rushed into the interior. Also from the back gate, carrying torches and lanterns for illumination, they broke in while the enemy's people were shouting and crying out loudly. Gōuemon and Yuranosuke sat on chairs on both sides, taking command. Although the number of avengers was small, they all fought bravely, risking their lives, making them truly formidable opponents. Yuranosuke and Gōuemon shouted loudly: "You need not strike others violently. Simply consider cutting down the one enemy as the primary achievement." Everyone heard the command and engaged in battle.

The southern neighbor was Nikki Harima-no-kami, and the northern neighbor was Ishidō Uma-no-jō. Both houses, saying there was some serious matter, had their retainers climb onto the roofs with lanterns, like bright stars, and called out toward the mansion: "There are sounds of clashing weapons, sword strikes, and arrows being shot at your residence. Could it be robbers, or perhaps lawless rogues causing some extraordinary incident? Our lord has ordered us to investigate." They shouted loudly.

Yuranosuke and Gōuemon heard this and answered in loud voices: "We are certainly not strangers. We are the retainers of Enya Takasada, forty-seven men fighting with our lives to avenge our late lord's false accusations. Speaking thus are Ōboshi Yuranosuke and Hara Gōuemon.

Originally, we have no grievances with your two noble houses. Who would dare to clash with you? Please tell everyone to be careful of fire, and we wish for you to withdraw with peace of mind. However, if you dispatch people to help out of neighborly friendship, that would mean we must fight against each other."

The people of both houses, hearing these words, were moved by their righteousness and said: "We who all serve our lord should each have such resolve. If anything should happen to you, we will all come to inquire." Having finished speaking, they withdrew their lanterns, and those people also went down.

"What would you do by listening to such talk? What I'm saying is not that I'm divorcing you and sending you away. There are some circumstances, so I'm temporarily having you return to your family home. Your father was originally a person under Kyūdayū's control and is not yet familiar with me. You must not tell him what's in my heart. Just pretend to be ill, and don't get up lightly. Also, don't wash your hair or face.

You have already forgotten what I told you before, casting it to the ninth heaven and not remembering it. With disheveled hair, no one will come seeking marriage proposals. Surely you don't mean to say you don't love your child? During the day, he plays foolishly with you and passes the day, but when night comes, he calls out seeking 'Mama.' Even when I comfort him saying 'Mother will return soon,' even when held, he cannot sleep peacefully. If I try to scold him with a frightening face to make him sleep, he doesn't cry out loudly, but just endures and weeps quietly. Seeing such bone-deep suffering, I cannot bear to sit and watch.

From this, I realize that only after bearing a child do you truly know a parent's love. Reflecting on myself, I regret my past unfilial behavior. Crying all night until dawn, last night I also picked him up three times. I just hold him as time passes, thinking to let him meet you. Thinking it over, even if I let him see you once, that doesn't mean I can sever all feeling. Waiting fifty days without seeing you, waiting a hundred days without seeing you - if we meet halfway just once, he'll long for you even more and suffer afterward.

I just carry him walking through three or five streets to put him to sleep, and when I return and lie down to let him sleep, even in dreams he gropes for the breast and clings tightly without letting go. Just being separated from you for a short while results in this state - how could I imagine making mother and child part for life?

Pressed by your father with no other choice, I wrote the divorce letter and had him take it. If you were to secretly flee, your father would not forgive the crime of your secretly returning. That would be inconvenient. Hurry home. This too is fate's determination."

All was silent with no human voices, and after the group had fought for several rounds, only two or three of their comrades had been wounded, while the number of wounded among the enemy household was countless. However, they could not find a single trace of their sworn enemy, Kō no Moronao. Teraoka Heiuemon ran around the entire mansion, searching every location from the ceiling beams to under the floorboards, and even in abandoned wells—there was no place left unexplored. Even searching with spears, they could not find him. When they reached the bedroom, they found that the bedding, pillows, and quilts still retained warm temperature. "On such a cold night, there is still warmth here, which means he escaped not long ago. He probably fled toward the front. Let us search the front hall," they said.

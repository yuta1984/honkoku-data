Yuranosuke, knowing well Gihei's character, entrusted him with arranging the necessary equipment. Gihei gladly accepted and secretly handled it with his life on the line. He wanted to repay the debt of gratitude, but his family was large, and he feared that if the matter were exposed and came to ruin, it would be troublesome.

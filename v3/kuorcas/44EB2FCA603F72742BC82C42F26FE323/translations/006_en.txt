Tonase dismissed the palanquin bearers and asked the servant girl to guide them inside. Her daughter Konami also rose and followed, sitting in the guest room. Yuranosuke came out quietly and said, "How unexpected that you two have come to this humble dwelling. We should have come out early to welcome you, but as your wife has surely heard, my luck has been bad and I am in this state. I am ashamed that you have come to visit me."

Tonase said, "Please don't say such things. Even though we meet for the first time today, you previously accepted my daughter as a bride for your son, and we will become relatives through this marriage arrangement. Why do you maintain such formal distance?"

Yuranosuke said, "Your words are too kind. Moreover, that the wife of the busy Lord Honzō has come all the way to Kyoto in this cold weather is beyond my expectations. Young Konami has surely come to Kyoto for the first time - have you seen the two shrines of Gion and Kiyomizu, and the two temples of Chion-in and the Great Buddha Hall? If you wish, we could also visit Kinkaku-ji. I have a good guide who can comfort her and show her everything."

Hearing this, Konami was bashful and only responded in a low voice. Tonase straightened herself and said to Yuranosuke, "I have come to this residence today for no other reason than this: after this girl was betrothed previously, our lord Enya suffered an unexpected disaster, and afterward we could not find where Lord Yuranosuke was living. This is the way of worldly changes - only a parent's heart remains unchanged. After searching high and low, I finally learned that you had moved to live in the Yamashina region. This girl has also reached marriageable age, so I hope to entrust her to you two, to become relatives and find peace of mind. I have come boldly to seek you out, knowing it is presumptuous. My husband should have come with me, but due to his official duties he could not come together. These two swords are my husband's soul - I carry them in his place. It is truly as if husband and wife have both come. I earnestly hope to meet Lord Yuranosuke and have you become her parent-in-law, so that I too may have peace of mind and happiness."

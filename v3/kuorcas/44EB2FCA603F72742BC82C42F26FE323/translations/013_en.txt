Through the intervening space, Honzō shouted loudly: "Stop interfering!" Using brute force to push aside those on his left and right, Ōishi immediately gripped his spear tightly and thrust it forward. Honzō quickly grabbed the spear tip and pulled it away. Ōishi shifted his body and stabbed again. Honzō quickly dodged to one side. Ōishi pulled back the spear, trying to pierce through both legs, but Honzō instead quickly saw the blade's ridge and kicked it up. Ōishi could not resist and dropped the spear to the ground. Fearing it would be taken from him, he ran forward trying to pick it up. Honzō grabbed his belt, threw him to the ground, immediately pressed him down under his knee, making him unable to move. Ōishi, pinned down by him, gnashed his teeth and clenched his fists in frustration. Tonaose and her daughter, watching this, cried out in anguish without stopping.

Then Rikiya came running out and, quicker than picking up the spear, thrust it through Honzō's chest. Honzō suffered in pain, unable to move, and collapsed forward. The mother and daughter cried out in anguish and embraced him, weeping. Rikiya did not look back, straightened the spear toward the throat, and was about to deliver the finishing blow when Yuranosuke shouted loudly.

"Rikiya, wait before killing him. There's no need to strike." He immediately seized the spear shaft and said to Honzō: "Since we parted ways before, we haven't met face to face for a long time. You have finally fulfilled your lifelong wish and fallen by your son-in-law's hand—you must be quite satisfied."

Honzō, touched to his heart by Yuranosuke's words, opened his eyes and said: "You who only wish to avenge your lord, enduring countless hardships, outwardly disguising yourself as a devotee of wine and women while secretly plotting—I just don't know if you've assembled all your comrades. When I think back, everything about you depends entirely on my person, Honzō. This spring when our lord was humiliated by Kō no Moronao at Tsurugaoka Shrine, he returned home in a rage and secretly called me to explain: 'No matter what, tomorrow in the palace I want to strike him down with one blow.' I could not calm his brave spirit, and only thought..."

[Marginal note] This too is a scene from the theatrical world. An ordinary person would naturally die by Rikiya's hand first before giving his daughter in marriage.

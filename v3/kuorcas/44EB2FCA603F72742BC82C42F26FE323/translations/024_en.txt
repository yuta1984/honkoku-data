Gihei feared that the man would shout loudly outside the gate, and if it echoed to the neighbors, it would not be discreet, so he hurriedly ran to open the gate. One of the constables immediately rushed into the gate and shouted, "Don't move! By official order, we arrest you!"

Gihei said, "For what reason do you arrest me?"

The two constables explained, saying: "You pretend not to know, but it's clear that you were commissioned by Ōboshi Yuranosuke, a retainer of Lord Enya Hangan, to purchase military equipment, load it on a ship, and send it to the Kamakura region.

Facing Gihei, he said: "We'll set this chest aside for now and question you. You must know in detail about the conspiracy of Lord Enya Hangan's retainers banding together to attack the High Councilor. If you confess the truth, we'll let you go unharmed. But if you don't confess, the consequences will fall upon your son," and then immediately

At that time, he had already severed the relationship between father-in-law and son-in-law, declaring that he should never come to his house again in the future. Knowing the urgent underlying intention, he felt it was regrettable and threw the divorce document in front of the gate. Ryōchiku hastily picked it up, stuffed it into his bosom, and immediately said:

"You are bold indeed. These past few days I've heard that rōnin have been coming and whispering about evil deeds. When I questioned my daughter, she evaded saying she didn't know. I cannot turn a blind eye if major trouble arises in the future. Having my daughter remain married to you causes me great worry. Fortunately, I've found a good match to serve as her father-in-law. Since I've already received the divorce document, I intend to arrange the marriage. Leave it to my arrangements - you should consider yourself deceived and be grateful."

Gihei said, "Although I've exchanged divorce papers, I haven't abandoned my feelings about my daughter remarrying. If you have such deep feelings about it, do as you please."

Ryōchiku said, "Naturally I will take charge as the main arranger. I'll have him serve as father-in-law tonight."

Gihei said, "Don't bother talking - leave quickly!" He grabbed him by the neck, threw him down outside the gate, and then closed the door.

Ryōchiku got up and shouted spitefully at the top of his voice: "Gihei, even though you've pushed me down, you'll become a bridegroom and have to compensate with many betrothal gifts. My family has suddenly become wealthy, and even being kicked down has worsened my chronic illness." He rubbed his back and legs and staggered home.

At this time, clouds obscured the moonlight, making the nearby view hazy. It was approximately past the hour of the Boar, entering the hour of the Rat. Looking at the neighboring houses in all directions, the night was deep and people were quiet.

The constables had each prepared iron clubs and ropes, and came directly to Gihei's gate to observe. They quietly called a subordinate and briefed him slightly. He deliberately knocked on the gate. Gihei asked from inside, "Who is knocking on the gate?"

From outside came the answer: "I'm the boatman who came this evening - I miscalculated the boat fare. Please open the gate."

Gihei said, "Why do you need to knock on the gate and bang on the door like this? I suppose it's just a small error. Tomorrow I'll calculate the difference for you."

The reply came: "It's tonight's departing boat, so if we don't settle accounts, we cannot set sail."

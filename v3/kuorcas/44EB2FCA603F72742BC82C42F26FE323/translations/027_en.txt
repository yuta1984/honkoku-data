"How enviable! Even after you all depart for the underworld, you will continue to serve your lord and fulfill your loyalty. Please, when that time comes, convey my humble devotion to our master."

The people listened to these words and could not help but shed tears, moved by his sincere feelings.

Yuranosuke said to Gihei: "Departing tonight for the Kamakura region to avenge our lord, it will not take more than a hundred days. I hear that your wife has also returned to her family home. Though it may be inconvenient for a while, we will soon send for her and you will be reunited as before."

Saying this, he was about to bid farewell and rise, when Gihei hurriedly held him back, saying: "This departure is an auspicious journey. Please allow me to serve some humble wine as a farewell."

Yuranosuke said: "Please don't trouble yourself."

Gihei said: "I would like to prepare some hand-made soba noodles."

Yuranosuke replied: "The two characters 'hand-made' are auspicious words for a military expedition. How could that not be good?"

Ōhashi and Yazama needed to remain behind, while the first group, together with Gōemon and Rikiya, would first depart for the Sata-no-mori region to rendezvous.

At that time, Gihei rose and led them inside. Yuranosuke said: "If I were to decline, that would be truly rude."

He took the three men and went to the back room. One could observe:

　The sword sinks in the deep pool, the jade ages in Jing Mountain. Without meeting Zhang Hua, one cannot distinguish the treasured sword,
　Only after obtaining the He family jade does one truly know its value of many cities. Bearing righteousness with iron resolve, who can overcome such spirit?
　Noble aspirations and pure heart - no one could wish to add to these. How regrettable to waste the hands that could strike enemies and repay vengeance,
　Sitting idly making only a bowl of river-leak noodles.

Before long, Gihei's wife, called Okatsu, appeared. Neither leaning east nor west, neither black nor white, caught in the middle with difficulty moving in either direction, she stood alone holding a small lantern, driven purely by a mother's love for her child, came directly to the gate and knocked, repeatedly calling "Igo." That foolish boy suddenly woke up and came running out.

"Migratory Bird of Tears"
Acclaimed = Special screening decided for next week
On rainy days, on windy days
Living in tears
I am a migratory bird of this floating world
Don't cry
Don't cry
...If you cry, even your wings won't obey you
That dream, and this dream
All scattered apart
I am a traveling bird of tears
Don't cry
Don't cry
...Crying won't bring back yesterday
The nostalgic homeland's
Sky is far away
I am an aimless traveling bird
Don't cry
Don't cry
...Tomorrow too, let's cross over that mountain
...Shochiku Kinema...

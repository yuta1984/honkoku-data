[Synopsis]…A model girl wore a beautiful fur coat. Of course, since she was a model, even if she wore it temporarily, it was to show to customers and not for her own possession. On the other hand, there was a noble lady who was tired of vanity and luxury and desired freedom, and the two agreed to exchange their positions for eight days. However, the model girl, in her drowsiness, finds that the devil uses the fur coat as bait to hook the woman, and although she gives kisses as the devil desires, she ultimately learns that the fur will not become hers. Since what the noble lady's fiancé intended to give the model girl was the same fur as before, she refused the kiss.

　　　　　A Passage from the Bible
――Previously, Herod had John arrested, bound, and imprisoned because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. This was because John had told Herod that it was not right for him to marry that woman. Though he wanted to kill John, he feared the people because they considered John a prophet. When Herod's birthday was celebrated, Herodias's daughter danced before the gathering and pleased Herod, so he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked for. Prompted by her mother, the girl said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist." The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her request be granted and had John beheaded in prison. His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother. ――Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 14――

　　The Salome Story

　A story from about two thousand years ago
　The pagan Herod was to be appointed ruler of Judea, a country within the Roman Empire, by Caesar's command. However, many among the Jewish people still longed for the former ruling Hasmonean family and wanted to install David, son of that house, in the highest priestly position, that of High Priest. The position of High Priest ranked second only to the ruler. Though Herod was quite a hero, Queen Miriam was the sister of the successor (that is, David, son of the former ruler), and through the instigation of the people, influential persons, and his beloved Salome (Herod's cousin), David was to be installed as High Priest. Salome commanded Sejanus, a young Syrian warrior who loved her, to assassinate David while he was bathing in a small pond.

　Around that time, Salome heard about John the Baptist, who had come to the Judean wilderness proclaiming God's appearance and admonishing people's sins, and wanted to see him, so she had him brought to the capital of Judea. The passionate Salome fell in love with John at first sight and wanted to make him her own, but John remained unmoved and only preached God's teachings and His coming. Meanwhile, as Miriam gradually gained power, Salome feared that the king's heart would turn to Miriam, so she devised a cunning plan. Before the king departed for Rome, she trapped Miriam with a poisoned cup incident, and when the king returned, she finally caused Miriam's death.
　Soon Herod held a grand banquet for his birthday, inviting high-ranking officials. John, now a prisoner in the palace, again refused Salome's demands, so Salome became irritated and returned to the king. The king swore to Salome that if she danced the dance of the seven veils, he would give her whatever she desired. Salome danced and demanded John's head. The king, having sworn to God, reluctantly gave John's head. As soon as Salome kissed the dead man's lips, a great storm suddenly arose, and Herod, believing that the wrath of the Baptist's God was descending upon him, quickly crushed Salome to death with his shield.
　　　Wilde's and Bara's Salome
　Those who have seen Bara's "Salome" will surely find many points where it differs from Wilde's "Salome." Wilde's Salome is a pure virgin, but Bara's harbors terrible schemes in her heart. In Bara's "Salome," the virtuous nobleman Aristobulus becomes David, and Herodias becomes Miriam. Wise readers will discover other differences, but I still recommend referring to "The New Salome" in Volume 3, November issue of "Katsudou Sekai" (Motion Picture World) for more on this matter.

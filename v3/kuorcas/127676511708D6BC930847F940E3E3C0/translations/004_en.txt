[Synopsis] The Matsunami family's daughters, sisters Sadako and Kiyoko, were both beautiful. Elder sister Sadako was to marry her beloved Koda Shojiro, and her parents spared no expense for their daughter, but behind the scenes there was the anguish of having to sell their villa. Living a glamorous life as a wealthy man's wife, Sadako tried to arrange a marriage between her husband's friend Sunaga Shichiro and Kiyoko, but Kiyoko disliked the frivolous Sunaga. After father Matsunami Ryohei's death from illness—Kiyoko moved to a modest house in the suburbs after graduating from girls' school, and one day met university student Nishiwaki. The cheerful Nishiwaki couldn't forget Kiyoko's eyes, but Sadako said things like "He's rather poor." About two years passed, and Nishiwaki and Kiyoko established a new household. In contrast to the modest happiness of the Nishiwaki couple, despite Sadako having become the mother of Ruiko, Sadako's household was dissolute and corrupt; Sunaga told Sadako about the affair between Koda and vocalist Tagawa Mieko. Later, the actress who made her Nichito Kinema debut film "Woman of the South" under the name Matsuda Tamaho was indeed Sadako, who had left the Koda house and had developed quite a deep relationship with actor Kido. Several years passed, and one day an unexpected visitor came to Nishiwaki's cultural housing—it was Sadako, changed and shabby. Nishiwaki forced Sadako to leave as retribution for her dissolute past, but a woman's heart is known only to women, especially between sisters—arguing with Koda and Mieko, pleading and persuading to get Ruiko back, Sadako, revived in true maternal love, was welcomed by the Nishiwaki couple.

Theme Song "Sisters"
Lyrics: Kato Genji
Music: Kamata Music Department

(Sadako)
If a flower, then a peony, if a bird
Then like a peacock, glamorously
I want to live my life
Love and truth of young days
Are all fleeting illusions
People live for money

(Kiyoko)
No, sister, if it were me
I would cling firmly
To love's single burning flame
Even if it's a poor life
If I'm with the one I love
What are this world's rain and wind

(Sadako)
Yesterday east, today west
The pleasures I chased were brief
How long this remaining sorrow
Where is yesterday's rainbow now
Lost on the thorny path
The journey is lonely, sister

(Kiyoko)
Welcome home, dear sister
A light burns at the edge of the wasteland
To the house where a dear boy waits
This world is lived through love
Let's wipe away tears and sing
A good mother's lullaby

・Story・
[Synopsis] Long, long ago, in ancient times, there was a place called Gojin Village on a certain beach in a southern country, and offshore towered Kiijo Island, where demons were said to have appeared since the age of gods, and from time immemorial, a tradition had been cultivated among the villagers that strength, physical power, and the strong could become the victors of everything.

In the village's sacred forest lived a Shinto priest called Kami Shiganokami, and the village's young men were training their arms to make his daughter Kotsuyu their own. However, Kotsuyu already had a lover named Kyutaro.

One day, a shrine sumo tournament was held for Kotsuyu. The young men fought to win the first prize of defeating five opponents.

On this day, a large man appeared from somewhere and abducted Kotsuyu and fled.

How great was Kyutaro's sadness; rising with determination, Kyutaro left the village behind and set off for Kiijo Island beyond the sea, where demons were said to live.

Japan's number one—not Momotaro but Kyutaro—fought and was greatly active on Kiijo Island, and brought back Kotsuyu, and they lived happily ever after.

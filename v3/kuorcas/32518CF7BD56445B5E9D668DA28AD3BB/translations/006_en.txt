However, what could Caiaphas's persecution mean to God's son Jesus, who would not hesitate to die for justice and humanity, and to his apostles? They crushed all of Caiaphas's faction's oppression with their sincere hearts, and finally brought the day of miracles even to Jerusalem. －－Yet Caiaphas's persecuting hand would not cease.

－－One day in Jerusalem. －－There was a woman accused of the sin of adultery. The people were about to subject her to the punishment of stoning. Caiaphas was delighted to hear of this. He immediately had Jesus judge the woman's sin before the public opinion of the crowd. The crowd held their breath for his judgment.
"Let him who is without sin among you first cast a stone"
As children of man, who could throw stones at the woman? Caiaphas's cunning scheme was again thwarted.
The people arose. They arose crying "Make Jesus our king!" Judas Iscariot was leading them. He was obsessed with the ambition that if Jesus became king, he as an apostle would also rise to high position.
"My kingdom is not of this earth!" －－Jesus was extremely calm.
Thus, having lost the object of his ambition in an instant, Judas foolishly exchanged Lord Jesus for thirty pieces of silver denarii.
The Last Supper. －－The farewell in the Garden of Gethsemane －－Jesus already knows his coming fate!
And so, on the moon-pale hill of Golgotha, Christ in divine white robes wearing a crown of thorns bore the cross. And －－quietly, quietly he went to sleep for his ascension to heaven.

Theme Song:

Filled with burning blood
There is no enemy before us
Overflowing in our hearts - the power of youth
Behold the strong standing - crowd of young people
The heroic figure of those aiming for the crown of glory

Filled with burning blood
The iron wall formation firm, straight balls fly like arrows
The sound of powerful hitting echoes in the autumn sky
Behold the strong standing - crowd of young people  
The heroic figure of those aiming for the crown of glory

Filled with burning blood
Proudly raising our brows, facing enemies like fire
Forever our alma mater - advancing while protecting
Behold the strong standing - crowd of young people
The heroic figure of those aiming for the crown of glory

"Even if you require learning, regarding the study of literature, even if you come for three thousand days, it would be difficult for you to fully comprehend it. It is natural that I do not find you strange. You just rest and merely demand calculations and comparisons."

[Interlinear commentary: If you have affairs to attend to and are busy, it is rather fortunate. Why do you not think so? As the saying goes, when there is surplus energy after conducting one's affairs, then one studies literature. If there is already no surplus energy for conduct, why would it be necessary to study literature? Even if you do not attend the thousand-day meetings, would someone like me find you strange? You should not merely argue with reasoning.]

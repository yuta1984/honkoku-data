◇Synopsis◇ In Edo where yakuza life flourished, Funakura no Ginji was a well-known boss. Though a villain, he was not avaricious and had many subordinates under him. Blind Yoichi tried to make his name in opposition to Ginji, picking fights with Ginji's gang at every opportunity. Ando Ichitaro, who was regarded as quite skilled and promising at the Chiba dojo, was actually the child of Edo magistrate Ando Kai-no-kami from his youth. When abandoned in distress, the thief Ginji found him and raised him to become a proper samurai, hiding his own base trade. But Ginji's devoted efforts eventually became known to Ichitaro, who came to admire the emotionally deep Ginji, despite his thievery, more than his heartless father who had fled after getting his mother pregnant. This Ichitaro one day rescued Osayo, daughter of collar-shop Kiyobei, when Yoichi was directing his men to kidnap her. When Yoichi learned that Ichitaro was Ginji's son, his resentment toward Ginji deepened, but Ichitaro and Osayo fell in love through this encounter. Around this time, two friends of Ichitaro from the Chiba dojo—one of them, Kobayashi—joined a political movement and together with his comrades killed Ichitaro's father, Ando Kai-no-kami.

One day, Tsukamoto promised to take Omitsu to the movies but stood her up, instead going to visit pitcher Miyajima's house. While spending enjoyable time with Miyajima's sister Yuriko and her friend Ayako, Tsukamoto became attracted to Ayako. The next day, when practice began at the baseball field, Omitsu and Ayako came to watch. Tsukamoto, having finished cheer practice, also came and spoke intimately with Ayako, which made Omitsu feel slight jealousy. Later, Tsukamoto was told that Ayako was a married woman, became dejected, and went drinking with a barbershop owner who was a fan, from café to teahouse. Meanwhile, the match against the rival school was finally approaching tomorrow. However, pitcher Miyajima, who carried everyone's hopes, suddenly suffered serious injuries and had to be hospitalized. Tsukamoto stayed by Miyajima's bedside with Omitsu for nursing care. The game began, and radio reported the crisis facing their school moment by moment. Miyajima from his sickbed asked Tsukamoto to leave him and go cheer for the team. Leaving the worrying Miyajima in his sickbed, Tsukamoto rushed to the game and put all his energy into cheering. And finally, Matsumura's miraculous hit, playing in place of Miyajima, brilliantly saved their school from crisis.

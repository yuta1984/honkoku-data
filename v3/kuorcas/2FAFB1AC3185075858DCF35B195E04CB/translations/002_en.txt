HIS MASTERS VOICE [Logo]
TRADE MARK REGISTERED [Logo]

(1) Haa
Raised on an island
A sixteen-year-old girl's heart in love
Hiding from people's eyes
One night of fleeting passion with her beloved

(2) Haa
The offshore waters are rough seas
The easterly wind that blew is a parting wind
Her beloved is a sailor
Now he lies beneath the waves, never to return

(3) Haa
Even the island's lights
Have gone out, and those plovers on the rocky shore
Don't cry for me
I am a sad, abandoned little boat

(4) Haa
Her beloved must be cold
Night after night with waves as his pillow
Snow falls gently
Plovers cry until dawn breaks on the shore

・・With melancholy tears aplenty, pure as a camellia, the emotions of an island daughter
In the southern land, a tragedy revolving around a beauty from Izu, the island of sacred fire・・
Tsubouchi Yoshiko's second starring film as a tearful migratory bird

You are a maiden, oh nineteen springs
Tears are sweet, oh nineteen springs spring
Flowers bloom and bud
The weeping nineteen springs spring
Even the tears that flow are filled with brilliance
How pitiful, the nineteen springs
Picking violets amid the falling white dew
The weeping nineteen springs spring
You are gentle and tears are sweet
When you sing a song, oh nineteen springs spring
A sorrowful maiden in long sleeves with a heart in love
The weeping nineteen springs spring

The unforgettable fragrance of flowers
Your face from those days of old
Ah, like an empty dream
Is a dreamless state the fate of love?
Ah――――

The unending feelings in my heart
Your words from those days of old
Ah, like distant stars
Is this coldness love's lingering trace?
Ah――――

You are a maiden, oh nineteen springs
Tears are sweet, nineteen springs, spring
Flowers bloom and blossom forth
The weeping nineteen springs, spring
Even flowing tears shine brightly
How pitiful, nineteen springs
Picking violets in the scattering white dew
The weeping nineteen springs, spring
You are gentle, tears are sweet
When singing songs, nineteen springs, spring
A sorrowful maiden in formal kimono with a heart in love
The weeping nineteen springs, spring

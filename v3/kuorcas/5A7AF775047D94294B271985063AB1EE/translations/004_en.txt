"The Sun Rises from the East"
Lyrics……Ogura Takechio
Music……Horiuchi Keizo

Above is the hotel's sun room
Wielding the shovel so lightly
Living while looking at tomorrow's hope
Sparkling, the sun rises from the east......

Oppressed yet bloomed flower
If it's the wind of sand and dust, whatever may come
But uncontrollable is the wind of love
Sparkling, the sun rises from the east......

Arms and compassion in gallant form
Even in eyes that gaze intently
There's heat like fire of steel
Sparkling, the sun rises from the east......

Beloved figure in spring patterns
Strong arms penetrating to the core
Somehow looking downcast and melancholy
Sparkling, the sun rises from the east......

The name "Sesshu Hayakawa" represents not just Samurai Nippon or Geisha Girl, but a world-class actor born of modern Japan. His name resounds not only in Hollywood, the capital of movies, but throughout America, and his profound artistic style is well established...........

Indeed!! Hayakawa Sesshu's first work in his homeland, the epic that Kamata presents in 1932, a magnificent deluxe edition that majestically reigns over the Lucky Seven film world. Therefore, please look forward to this cinematic giant's performance...........

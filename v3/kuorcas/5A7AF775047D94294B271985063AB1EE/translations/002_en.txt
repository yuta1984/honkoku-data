"The nostalgic willows of Ginza have been revived in the glamorous streets of Tokyo's Ginza・Modern Japan's modern Tokyo・On the asphalt of modern Ginza, though times have changed since the old days of horse-drawn railway cars, the name of Ginza's willows has become one of the beautiful remnants from Edo to Tokyo........"

How delightful to plant, the willows of Ginza
Pale green remnants of Edo
Blow, spring wind, red parasols and sun umbrellas
Today too, people bustle round and round
……………
Paris chestnuts, Ginza willows
East and west, lodgings of love
Who might she be waiting for, that girl's shoulders
Caressed gently by the thread willows
……………
Love is crimson, willows are green
Dyeing the capital in spring patterns
How joyful is Ginza, the willows beckon
Beckoning the crowds of Showa
……………

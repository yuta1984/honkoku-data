*A Brief Commentary on the Heart Sutra, One Volume*
Compiled by Monk Shinko of Kofuku-ji Temple in Great Japan

*The Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra*

Ten people have composed commentaries on this sutra, each writing their own version: Deva Dharma Master (from Central India), Ji, Ce, Mai, Qi, Fazang, Zhikai and other masters, as well as Wumin, Bintang, Kukai, and Chiko (from Japan). Some commentaries exist without author names. This present work follows Ji's commentary.

In explaining this sutra, I divide it into five sections: 1) describing the origin and purpose of the teaching, 2) clarifying the sutra's doctrine and purpose, 3) explaining the sutra's title, 4) showing differences in translations, and 5) interpreting the main text of the sutra.

First, regarding the origin and purpose of the teaching: This is taught for sentient beings who are obscured by karmic habits, who respectfully accept false teachings, slander the Mahayana, cling literally to sutras about emptiness and existence, and mistakenly expound existence and emptiness regarding the two truths of conventional and ultimate reality. In the dharmas of mind and objects, they successively generate grasping and rejection. To properly distinguish between true and false meanings of the correct Dharma, so that sentient beings who believe and study may all obtain benefit and happiness, I rely on what was previously transmitted to briefly praise the Middle Way. As in the Sandhinirmocana Sutra, the Buddha initially turned the Wheel of the Four Noble Truths solely for those inclined toward the śrāvaka path. Though extremely wonderful, it was not yet of definitive meaning. Next, solely for those inclined toward the Mahayana, he turned the wheel of hidden meaning, teaching that all phenomena lack inherent nature. Though extremely wonderful, it was still not of definitive meaning. Now, for those who aspire to all vehicles, he turns the wheel of clear meaning. This is supreme and unexcelled, the true teaching of definitive meaning in the ultimate sense. Because sentient beings are deluded about the true nature of phenomena, generate afflictions, create karma, and sink in the ocean of birth and death, the great sage and dharma king realized the inherent nature of phenomena and through skillful means

responds to their capacities. Within the dharma beyond words, he uses words to reveal and explain, wanting them to accordingly attain the Middle Way true nature. Therefore he expounded this sutra. Such is the purpose of its origin.

Second, clarifying the sutra's doctrine and purpose: The ancients classified sutras and treatises into four schools. First is the "establishing nature" school, represented by the Abhidharmahṛdaya and others, which establishes that the five aggregates have substantial nature. Second is the "breaking nature" school, represented by the Satyasiddhi treatise, which breaks the substantial existence of phenomena, holding that only characteristics exist. Third is the "breaking characteristics" school, represented by the Prajñāpāramitā and others, which breaks the characteristics and forms of phenomena, also establishing emptiness. Fourth is the "revealing reality" school, represented by the Avataṃsaka and others, which reveals the true Middle Way meaning. This sutra belongs to both the third and fourth schools. Because it frequently teaches emptiness, it belongs to the third school, and because it doesn't contradict existence, it belongs to the fourth school. Thus the Madhyāntavibhāga states that such reasoning wonderfully accords with the Middle Way and also perfectly harmonizes with the Prajñāpāramitā and other sutras in teaching that all phenomena are neither empty nor existent. Regarding gradual and sudden teachings, it encompasses both. Regarding partial and complete teachings, it belongs to the complete teaching. Regarding conditioned and unconditioned, it can penetrate both approaches. Regarding conventional and ultimate truth, it divides into two according to circumstances. Regarding definitive and provisional teachings, it belongs to the definitive meaning.

Master Chiko of Kawachi province said that Cien and others considering the Prajñāpāramitā teaching as second-period provisional meaning represents extreme delusion.
I ask: from whom did this master hear such a thing? According to Cien's explanation, based on the Sandhinirmocana Sutra, teachings of one-sided emptiness are called second-period provisional meaning. The Prajñāpāramitā sutras are not entirely empty. Though they frequently teach emptiness, they don't contradict existence. If one judges the period by the teaching, it's second period; if one judges the period by principle, it extends to the third period. Not knowing the profound meaning yet rashly criticizing the sacred words can truly be called superficial.

Third, explaining the sutra's title: "Prajñāpāramitā" is the general name of the great sutra. "Heart Sutra" is this particular sutra's specific designation. It is the Heart of Prajñāpāramitā. Among the six types of compound analysis, this uses the dependent compound (karmadhāraya) as its name.

Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā. To truly understand the meaning of this phrase means the so-called "no-meaning," and so forth extensively. However, the right contemplation explained above is the dhāraṇī of patience. The divine mantra explained here is the dhāraṇī of incantation. Various dhāraṇīs appear throughout the sutras; one should understand by analogy.

○ Next the sutra compiler elaborates:

"Then spoke the incantation, saying:"

Like "At that time the World-Honored One..." up to "...addressed the Buddha" in various sutras, all are elaborations of circumstances by those who compiled the Dharma treasury. This is also the same.

○ Third, properly explaining the essence of the mantra:

Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā

Upon reflection, all the phrases in the incantations of various sutras are empowered by the spiritual power of buddhas and bodhisattvas. Each word and phrase also encompasses multiple meanings. If translated into the language of this land [China], characters might be added or subtracted, creating deficiencies in meaning and rendering recitation ineffective. Therefore translators do not translate them. Sometimes they use sounds for addressing ghosts, spirits, devas, and animals, which are not words commonly heard by Indians. Therefore they are not translated. All sutras are like this. However, when Ji, Ce and others provide interpretive translations, this is quite inappropriate. Not only do they not understand the purport of the incantation words, but they render recitation ineffective for practitioners. Why would anyone harbor doubts? Following such examples, one would vainly exhaust mental consciousness and wastefully pass time without benefit.

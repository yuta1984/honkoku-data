Among the eight grammatical cases, the genitive case serves as the designation. Although this Heart Sutra is also called "Prajñā," the former (Prajñā) is general while this (Heart Sutra) is specific. Therefore it is simply called the "Heart" [Sutra]. The meaning of prajñā wisdom has five types: First is true reality (bhūtatathāta), namely true principle. Second is contemplative illumination, namely true wisdom. Third is written words, namely true teaching. (The above are ancient interpretations.) Fourth is retinue, namely all practices. Fifth is realm, namely all phenomena. (The above are newly added.) Cultivating merit and wisdom together, illuminating existence and emptiness equally, seeking the doctrine to meet its essence, investigating principle to understand arising - both the nature of wisdom and the support of wisdom are all called prajñā. It can eliminate karmic obstructions, realize the true principle of dharma, is the head of all virtues and the guide of all practices. Though uniquely named "wisdom," it encompasses all phenomena. "Pāra" means "the other shore." Ancient explanations have two: bodhi and nirvana. The present interpretation has five: first realm, second teaching, third principle, fourth practice, fifth fruit. "Mitā" means separation and arrival. By practicing prajñā, one separates from all obstructions and defilements, the realm exhausts existence and non-existence, understanding penetrates the six collections, meaning penetrates conventional and ultimate truth, karma prepares the two causes, enlightenment becomes complete and tranquility becomes perfect - thus one ascends to the other shore. Combining essence and function, this name is established. "Heart" is a designation for firm, substantial, wonderful, and supreme. "Sutra" refers to maxims that ferry one to wonderful principle and eternal standards that guide deluded beings. Wanting them to accordingly realize, whether depending on or expounding, if one realizes the truth of prajñā, then expound this sutra. Therefore the designation "heart" is used. However, various editions of the sutra sometimes add the two characters "mahā" or the four characters "Buddha spoke mahā" - these are all additions by laypeople. Therefore Master Kūkai's secret key states that the translation by Tang Dynasty Tripiṭaka Master Xuanzang has no such four characters "Buddha spoke mahā," which agrees with the Profound Praise commentary.

Fourth, showing differences in translation: This sutra has different translations, briefly comprising seven versions. First is the translation by Later Qin Tripiṭaka Master Kumārajīva, titled "Mahāprajñāpāramitā Great Bright Dhāraṇī Sutra." Second is the translation by Great Tang Tripiṭaka Master

**Page Two, Lower Section**

Xuanzang, titled "Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya Sutra." Third is the translation by Great Zhou Tripiṭaka Master Yijing, with the same title as Xuanzang's. (Not seen.) Fourth is the translation by the South Indian Bodhiruci during the Tang period, titled "Prajñāpāramitānaya Sutra." (Not seen.) Fifth is the translation by Eastern India Tripiṭaka Master Fayue, titled "Buddha Spoke Universal Knowledge Treasury Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya Sutra." Sixth is the translation by Kashmir Tripiṭaka Master Prajñā, with the same title as Xuanzang's. Seventh is the translation by Tripiṭaka Master Prajñācakra of Daxingshan Temple in the capital, with the same title as Xuanzang's. What is explained here is Xuanzang's translation that circulates in the world. Those that add the character "mahā" to the title are merely scribal additions.

Fifth, explaining the main text of the sutra: Within this there are two parts - first general, then specific. Speaking of general explanation: the great sutra follows individual capacities, with both text and meaning being vast, so in receiving, maintaining, transmitting and studying it, one might generate timidity and retreat. The sage who transmitted the dharma recorded its essential points and separately produced this sutra. The three divisions and two introductory sections were therefore all omitted. Selecting and synthesizing the subtle and profound, compiling and extracting the essential guidelines. Though phenomena number in the myriads, they are unified as form being emptiness. Though the path extends through a thousand gates, it penetrates non-wisdom while gaining both. Exploring the secret purport of the extensive text, it establishes true mind as its designation. Question: If one records the essentials from the great sutra and separately produces this sutra, with the three divisions and two introductory sections therefore all being absent, then why do the translations by Fayue, Prajñācakra and Tripiṭaka Master Prajñā all have the three divisions and two introductory sections? Answer: There are briefly two explanations. First, when the dharma-transmitting sage briefly produced this sutra, depending on what was omitted, there were additionally two types. Following what was produced, the Sanskrit originals differed. The two types of tripiṭaka masters each obtained different versions, so the translations differ. Second explanation: personally examining the Sanskrit original, it lacked introductory and concluding sections. Tripiṭaka masters like Fayue

**Page Three, Upper Section**

and others inferred the meaning of the great sutra and, beyond the Sanskrit original, embellished and added to it. Adding translations beyond the original - such examples are not unique. Tripiṭaka masters like Xuanzang completely obtained the Sanskrit original, so they differ.

The sutra states: "Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva." Commentary: This is the specific explanation. In this sutra there are generally three sections. First, "Avalokiteśvara" etc. establishes the practice of the superior person and encourages the arousing of the aspiration for enlightenment. Next, "Śāriputra" etc. presents the name of the one with spiritual receptivity and expounds principles through analogies. Finally, "bodhisattva" etc. reveals the virtues of dependent learning and praises the attainment of supreme benefit. Or first, it has the mind undergo refinement, next it eliminates the four locations, finally it separates from suffering and achieves complete realization. Refinement has three aspects. Now establishing the bodhisattva as the previously practicing person and encouraging the arousing of aspiration is the first refinement. That is, hearing that bodhi is vast and profound, if one generates retreat and discouragement, one should refine the mind. That Avalokiteśvara, when first generating the intention, possessed all afflictions, yet within the cave of ignorance established a victorious mind, abandoned body, life and wealth, sought the Buddha's wisdom, aroused great courage, and already achieved near-perfect enlightenment. I too should be thus. Encouraging oneself to increase practice, one should not belittle oneself and generate retreat. "Observation" means the meaning of investigation - it is the wisdom and compassion that looks down to rescue. "Freedom" means the meaning of non-obstruction - it is the wonderful function of salvation and relief. If beings with sincere and pure three karmas take refuge, their prayers will certainly be answered. Manifesting transformations through the six supernatural powers, without leisure from suffering and calamity. Flying the wheel to subdue, acting as an uninvited friend, serving as a doctor who responds to illness. The benefits gathered are inconceivable - hence named "Avalokiteśvara." Also, "observation" means the meaning of illumination - it is wisdom that understands emptiness and existence. "Freedom" means the meaning of unrestrained activity - it is the supreme fruit obtained. Formerly practicing the six perfections, now obtaining perfect fruition. With wisdom-observation as primary, achieving the ten masteries. The position reaches the stage of succession, the path achieves perfect enlightenment, with nothing obscure left unilluminated, hence

named "Avalokiteśvara." Simply saying "Avalokita" loses both word and meaning. "Bodhisattva" is abbreviated as "bodhi" which is prajñā, and "sattva" which is skillful means. These two can create all benefits and happiness for sentient beings. Also, "bodhi" means awakening - the fruit sought by wisdom. "Sattva" means sentient being - the beings saved by compassion. According to the language of great vows, hence named "bodhisattva." Possessing compassion and wisdom, particularly practicing loving-kindness, continuing and elevating pure buddha-lands, looking down to save defiled realms. With appropriate spiritual response, therefore only this is established. Or dwelling in superior positions, all those who possess great minds and achieve wonderful wisdom are all "Avalokiteśvara." Or this is pointed out to make one gaze and call it "observation" - not one who dwells in the Western [Pure Land] and comes wandering to this [world]. Because in that great sutra this is not separately revealed.

In the commentary explaining the sutra, two approaches are presented. First is the Nāgārjuna school, called "those who excel in emptiness." Second is the Dharmapāla school, called "those who respond appropriately." Though there are two interpretations, now following Dharmapāla. All below should be understood accordingly. Master Chikō of Kawachi province said that Masters Ji (Kuiji), Ce and others combining "Avalokiteśvara" and "Bodhisattva" into one phrase as a person's name is quite inappropriate. This master's intention was to take "Avalokiteśvara" as the great being who engages in dialogue, and "bodhisattva" as the person who is able to practice, dividing them into two phrases that can accord with the sutra's purport. Now I say this explanation conversely reveals self-ignorance. Tripiṭaka Master Fayue's translation states: "Thereupon Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, receiving the Buddha's permission, through the Buddha's spiritual power, entered the wisdom-light samādhi, practiced the profound Prajñāpāramitā, and illuminatingly saw that the inherent nature of the five aggregates is all empty." Tripiṭaka Master Prajñā's translation states: "At that time in the assembly there was a bodhisattva mahāsattva named Avalokiteśvara. When practicing the profound Prajñāpāramitā, he illuminatingly saw that the five aggregates are all empty and was liberated from all suffering and difficulty." Prajñācakra's translation is the same. It is clearly known that "Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva" is indeed one phrase. Why make the clamorous opinions of a frog in a well and scheme with the wisdom of a sea turtle? Other erroneous words are not worth mentioning.

The sutra states: "When practicing the profound Prajñāpāramitā." Commentary: This shows that through learning wisdom one can then illuminate the emptiness of inherent nature, demonstrating the dharma practiced by the predecessor. This is the second refinement of mind. That is, seeing that the myriad practices of bodhisattvas are difficult to practice, if one generates retreat, one should refine the mind. Since beginningless time, in order to seek worldly pleasures, I was still able to fully endure meaningless multitudinous sufferings. How much more so when seeking bodhi, to escape birth and death and save sentient beings, should I not generate a timid and inferior mind? This profound prajñā he has already studied and practiced. I too should be thus. Being inferior to oneself yet increasing practice, not...

The Vinaya teaching school of the various provinces of Japan was widely practiced at that time, and there was no one who did not study according to it. They also built Tōshōdai-ji Temple and transmitted and propagated the Vinaya. It continues uninterrupted to this day. The transmission and propagation of the Vinaya teaching school to Japan was entirely due to the power of Great Master Jianzhen.

Question: How many patriarchs does this school establish?

Answer: From Venerable Kāśyapa to recent times in the Song dynasty, their total number is extremely large. Namely, the Buddha is the teaching lord, and the principle lies in the ineffable. Venerable Kāśyapa, Venerable Ānanda, Venerable Madhyāntika, Venerable Śāṇakavāsin, Venerable Upagupta, Dharmagupta (translated as Dharma-Correct Venerable), Dharmakalāra (translated as Dharma-Time Venerable), Vinaya Master Facong, Vinaya Master Daofu, Vinaya Master Huiguang, Vinaya Master Daoyun, Vinaya Master Daohong, Vinaya Master Zhishou, Vinaya Master Nanshan, Vinaya Master Zhouxiu, Vinaya Master Daoheng, Vinaya Master Shenggong, Vinaya Master Huizheng, Vinaya Master Fabao, Vinaya Master Yuanbiao, Vinaya Master Shouyan, Vinaya Master Wuwai, Vinaya Master Fasong, Vinaya Master Chuheng, Vinaya Master Zewu, Vinaya Master Yunkan, Vinaya Master Zeqi, and Vinaya Master Yuanzhao. If we take separately from the initial arising of this Vinaya to Vinaya Master Nanshan, they are verified as nine patriarchs, taking from Dharma-Correct Venerable. The succession after Nanshan is the same as before.

If we follow the Japanese propagation and transmission: Vinaya Master Nanshan, Vinaya Master Hongjing, Great Prelate Jianzhen, Great Bishop Hōshin, Lesser Bishop Nyohō, Archbishop Hōan, and others.

Question: Does the Four-Part Vinaya school have different interpretations and branch transmissions?

Answer: There were such in the Tang dynasty. Namely, Vinaya Master Fali of the Xiang school, Vinaya Master Daoxuan of Zhongnan Mountain, and Vinaya Master Huaisu of the Eastern Pagoda of Xidayuan Temple each established different doctrinal branches and disputed with each other. This is called the "Three Vinaya Schools." Master Jianzhen transmitted both the Great Commentary of the Xiang School and the Qiuwen of Nanshan

to Japan. Various temples and monasteries all had them lecture on and master those three Tang dynasty schools. Later only Nanshan remained, while the other schools became abandoned and discontinued. This is truly because Nanshan's doctrinal system has receiving and following in mutual correspondence, complete behavioral aspects, harmony between greater and lesser paths, and mutual correspondence between understanding and practice. Masters of past and present have all competed in praising it, and worthies and sages of various schools all study and depend on it. Like the Xingshi Chao, seventy-three schools mutually composed commentaries and explanations. Both our own realm and other regions all render reverent service to it. Though there are people praised by patriarchs and noble sages, why is it like this? Generally speaking, since the translation of the Four-Part Vinaya Canon, the masters who composed commentaries number approximately twenty schools. However, taking the essential, they do not exceed three commentaries: Vinaya Master Huiguang's Brief Commentary in four fascicles, Vinaya Master of the Xiang School's Medium Commentary in ten fascicles, and Vinaya Master Zhishou's Extensive Commentary in twenty fascicles. These are called the "Three Essential Commentaries." However, the doctrines of Li, Xuan, and Su of the Tang dynasty's three schools encompass and bind together various interpretations, mostly contained in these three.

For the Great Commentary of the Xiang School, Vinaya Master Songyue composed a commentary to explain it—the Shizongyi Ji in ten fascicles. Vinaya Master Zhishou's Great Commentary is what Nanshan inherited, so it is one path with Nanshan. Vinaya Master of the Eastern Pagoda's Sifenkaizong Ji in ten fascicles circulated alone throughout the realm. They mutually claimed to exhaust excellence and were both called "guides." At the end of the Tang, there was competitive arising in the Eastern Capital. Also, Vinaya Master Xuanyun's Pini Taoyao in three fascicles differed slightly from other schools. The Four-Part Great and Small Commentaries are these. They are mostly the same as Nanshan. These six schools' commentaries were all transmitted to Japan. Now they flourish in studying and depending on the single Nanshan school, while also practicing the doctrines of Songyue and the New School. The differences in the three schools' Vinaya doctrines—fearing prolixity, I will not describe them. Vinaya Master Nanshan composed commentaries totaling five great sections: First, Xingshi Chao in three fascicles (divided into twelve fascicles); second, Jie Shu in four fascicles

(divided into eight fascicles); third, Ye Shu in four fascicles (divided into eight fascicles); fourth, Shi Pini Yi Chao in three fascicles (originally three fascicles, but the lower fascicle was lost, leaving only the upper and middle sections. Now divided into four fascicles); fifth, Biqiuni Chao in three fascicles (divided into six fascicles). He also composed annotations for the Precept Text and Karmavācanā, as well as minor Vinaya chapters. The other various texts and compilations are numerous and cannot be completely enumerated. What the Nanshan Vinaya school properly studies and depends upon are precisely these five great sections and others. Their fundamental basis is the Four-Part Vinaya in sixty fascicles. Speaking of treatise explanations, it is the Samantapāsādikā.

Question: What dharma doctrines does this school clarify?

Answer: This school clarifies precepts. There are two types: First, restraint-maintenance precepts—the various gates of restraining evil in the five categories. Second, performance-maintenance precepts—the various gates of cultivating good such as reciting precepts. All the various precepts explained by the Tathāgata are completely encompassed and exhausted by the encompassing of these two maintenances. Therefore, the doctrinal principles explained in the main Vinaya's essential section are only these two maintenances of restraint and performance. The initial two-part precept text is called restraint-maintenance. The latter twenty chapters (khandhakas) are called performance-maintenance. The two-part precept text refers to the two assemblies of monks and nuns. What bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs maintain is called the complete precepts. Among the two-part precepts explained in the precept text, first the monastic precepts are clarified. Monks have 250 precepts, divided into eight sections.

First, pārājika—there are four of these precepts: sexual misconduct, theft, killing, and false speech. Second, saṃghāvaśeṣa—there are thirteen of these precepts: 1) intentional emission precept, 2) touching women precept, 3) coarse speech precept, 4) praising oneself and seeking offerings precept, 5) matchmaking precept, 6) owned dwelling precept, 7) unowned dwelling precept, 8) groundless slander precept, 9) contrived slander precept, 10) schism violation of admonishment precept, 11) assisting schism violation of admonishment precept, 12) corrupting families banishment slander violation of admonishment precept, 13) bad character refusing saṃgha violation of admonishment precept. Third, two indeterminates: 1) private place

indeterminate, 2) open place indeterminate. Fourth, niḥsargika-pāyattika—there are thirty of these: long robes, separation from robes, extra bowls, begging for bowls, etc. Fifth, pāyattika—there are ninety of these: minor false speech, divisive speech, digging earth, destroying life, drinking alcohol, eating at improper times, etc. Sixth, four pratideśanīya: accepting food in wilderness, accepting food from learning families, etc. Seventh, one hundred śaikṣa precepts: neatly wearing robes, joking, jumping about, etc. Eighth, seven adhikaraṇa-śamatha: present vinaya, recollection vinaya, etc. These eight sections completely encompass the 250 precepts. Encompassing and binding the eight sections into five categories: First, pārājika; second, saṃghāvaśeṣa—the encompassing of offenses in these two is just as in the previous sections. Third, pāyattika—combining the previous forfeiture-falls and simple falls into one, totally encompassing 120 precepts. Fourth, pratideśanīya—as before. Fifth, duṣkṛta—combining two indeterminates, one hundred śaikṣa, and seven adhikaraṇa-śamatha into one category, totaling 109 precepts. This establishes five categories according to resultant offenses and urgent essential matters. Other offenses outside these establish six groups to collect and encompass them: First, pārājika; second, saṃghāvaśeṣa; third, sthūlātyaya; fourth, pāyattika; fifth, pratideśanīya; sixth, duṣkṛta. These are the six groups. If duṣkṛta is opened, it becomes seven groups. The first five are complete as before: sixth, wrong action; seventh, wrong speech. Among the seven groups, pārājika, saṃghāvaśeṣa, fall offenses, and pratideśanīya have offense encompassing the same as the category gates. The single sthūlātyaya group encompasses all causal and resultant light and heavy various offenses in group gates outside the five categories and outside duṣkṛta. Wrong action and wrong speech encompass duṣkṛta in category gates and all other causal and resultant duṣkṛta offenses. Therefore, apart from the seven groups, there are no additional offenses, because the six and seven groups completely encompass offenses. Next, nun precepts are clarified. Bhikṣuṇī precepts in the original Vinaya's explanation of characteristics have only 341 precepts. Bound into six

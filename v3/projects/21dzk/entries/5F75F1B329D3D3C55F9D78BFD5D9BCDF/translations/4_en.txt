Among the scholars of the Sarvāstivāda school, there was Harivarman, a chief disciple of Kumāralāta. Disliking his teacher's views as extremely shallow and inferior, he selected the finest doctrines from various schools, made them into one category, and established a school. During the Yao Qin dynasty, Tripiṭaka Master Kumārajīva translated and propagated it. It consists of sixteen fascicles in one collection with 202 chapters. Many masters in China composed commentaries and subcommentaries, and even in Japan, people have studied based on it.

Question: Among the twenty schools, to which school does this treatise tradition properly belong? And what are these "finest doctrines"?

Answer: Regarding the determination of the fundamental school on which the Satyasiddhi Treatise depends, various interpretations differ. Some say it depends on the Bahuśrutīya school, some say the Sūtrānta school, some say it explores the Mahāyāna to explain the Hīnayāna, some say it depends on the Dharmaguptaka school, some say it takes the best from various schools, and some say it depends on the Mahīśāsaka school. Also, the three great Dharma masters of the Liang dynasty (Dharma Master Fayun of Guangzhai Temple, Dharma Master Zhizang of Kaishan Temple, and Dharma Master Wenmin of Zhuangyan Temple)—all three schools said the Satyasiddhi Treatise is Mahāyāna. Tiantai and Jiaxiang both judged it to be Hīnayāna. Nanshan and Lingzhi both said it partially connects to Mahāyāna (the same view as the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya). Thus the various masters' different theories are not in agreement. However, since Jingying and Tiantai onward, most have commonly evaluated it, saying the Satyasiddhi Treatise is the finest within the Hīnayāna. Only Vinaya Master Nanshan said the teaching is Hīnayāna but the doctrine connects to Mahāyāna. Within Hīnayāna, many say Satyasiddhi mostly depends on the Sūtrānta school, or on the Dharmaguptaka school. Those "finest doctrines" refer to this school's complete clarification of the two emptinesses. Therefore it establishes contemplation in two types: First, emptiness contemplation—like there being no water in a vase, there is no personal self among the five aggregates, so this is contemplation of personal emptiness. Second, no-self contemplation—like a vase having no real substance, all dharmas of the five aggregates are merely conventional designations, so this is contemplation of dharma emptiness. Since it already

clarifies the two emptinesses, its doctrine is the finest.

Question: If so, can it sever the two attachments and manifest the two emptinesses?

Answer: Not so. Although it discusses the two emptinesses, it only severs view and thought [delusions] and does not sever cognitive hindrances. It is merely that its intellectual understanding is extremely profound. This treatise clarifies twenty-seven nobles and sages to encompass the stages of sages and nobles. Those twenty-seven are: First, faith-followers, at the stage of hearing and thinking. Second, dharma-followers, at the stage of the four wholesome roots. Third, signless practitioners—these are the previous two who enter the path of seeing. These three people are called "stream-enterer candidates." Fourth, stream-enterer result; fifth, once-returner candidate; sixth, once-returner result; seventh, non-returner candidate. Within the non-returner result, eleven people are distinguished: first, intermediate parinirvāṇa; second, birth parinirvāṇa; third, effortful parinirvāṇa; fourth, effortless parinirvāṇa; fifth, delighting in wisdom; sixth, delighting in concentration; seventh, world-transmigrator; eighth, present parinirvāṇa; ninth, faith-liberated; tenth, view-attainer; eleventh, body-witness. Combined with the previous seven people, they total eighteen, called "learners." The following nine people are all no-more-learners: first, prone to regression; second, guardian; third, death-bound; fourth, stable; fifth, improvable; sixth, unshakeable; seventh, wisdom-liberated; eighth, both-liberated; ninth, non-regressing. Combined with the previous eighteen, they total twenty-seven nobles and sages. Eighty-four dharmas completely encompass all dharmas. Though not yet having advanced into Mahāyāna, within Hīnayāna it is especially excellent—truly nothing to wonder at. Is this Mahāyāna? All dharmas return to the one truth of cessation; the principle of emptiness is serene. Dharmas are established upon this. Attachment to real dharmas melts like ice, and provisional myriad phenomena appear like a dense forest. Void-penetrating and wonderful-penetrating—its purport is profound indeed.

**Vinaya School**

Question: Why is it called the Vinaya school?

Answer: Because it takes the Vinaya as its foundation, it is called the Vinaya school.

Question: How many schools of Vinaya are there?

【Left Page】

Answer: There are various schools of Vinaya—namely two schools, five schools, eighteen, and five hundred. These represent what the Tathāgata taught scattered according to capacity during his fifty years in the world, which disciples later compiled by ascending the seat after his extinction, called "one school." The Eighty Recitations Vinaya Great Vinaya Piṭaka was transmitted by five masters after the Buddha's extinction by one hundred years, purely of one flavor, not yet divided into different views. After one hundred years it gradually divided into two schools, five schools, and twenty schools, up to five hundred different views competing like vast waves. Sūtras and treatises were the same. Since the teachings of the Tripiṭaka and so forth are divided as one category, among them the Vinaya section was formed differently according to different doctrinal positions. Thus one great canon was divided into various schools. Though such schools are numerous, they do not exceed the twenty schools. Therefore there are twenty schools within the Vinaya section. In India, various schools were all propagated. However, what was transmitted to China includes in total four Vinayas and five treatises. The four Vinayas are: First, the Ten Recitations Vinaya, translated into sixty-eight fascicles—this is the Vinaya of the Sarvāstivāda school. Second, the Four-Part Vinaya, translated into sixty fascicles—this is the Vinaya of the Dharmaguptaka school. Third, the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya, translated into forty fascicles—this represents the cave-dwelling elders among the fundamental two schools. Since the name "Mahāsāṃghika" applies to two schools. Fourth, the Five-Part Vinaya, translated into thirty fascicles—this is the Vinaya of the Mahīśāsaka school among the five schools. The Kāśyapīya Vinaya only transmitted the prātimokṣa; the extensive Vinaya has not yet circulated. All four Vinayas were translated into Chinese and all practiced. However, only the Dharmaguptaka Four-Part Vinaya school alone circulated in later generations. The five treatises are: First, the Vinayamātṛkā; second, the Mātṛkā—these depend on the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya. Third, the Samantapāsādikā—this explains the Four-Part Vinaya. Fourth, the Sarvāstivāda treatise—this explains the Ten Recitations Vinaya. Fifth, the Spaṣṭārtha treatise—this depends on the Saṃmitīya Vinaya. Besides these, various Vinayas of the Vinaya Piṭaka and newly translated Sarvāstivāda schools were all transmitted to China.

However, the single Four-Part Vinaya has deep connections with this land. In the past, before Vinaya Master Zhishou, the various schools were mixed and chaotic, not yet being exclusively studied. Vinaya Masters Zhishou and Nanshan either composed the "Commentary Distinguishing the Five Schools" or examined China—when first conferring the ordination substance, they exclusively depended on the Four Parts to clarify the ordination substance, relying only on the Dharmaguptaka to discuss subsequent conduct. From then on, even to Japan, only this school was transmitted. Therefore, focusing on the single Four-Part Vinaya, I will describe the origin of its arising and clarify the source of its transmission and propagation.

Question: When did the Four-Part Vinaya school arise?

Answer: Before the division, it was one flavor transmitted like pouring from vase to vase. When the Tathāgata was in the world, he taught scattered according to capacity. One hundred years after the Buddha's extinction, it was compiled and transmitted. During the time of one hundred-plus years, the arhat Dharmagupta recited it according to his view and made it one school. This was when this school first branched off.

Question: When was it transmitted to China and Japan?

Answer: During the Cao Wei period, Venerable Fashi first received ordination. During the Yao Qin period, Tripiṭaka Master Juemeng first transmitted the extensive Vinaya. This is the origin of ordination transmission in China. Regarding Japan, in the past during the Tenpyō era, two Japanese masters, Eiei and Fusho, went to the Tang court and invited Great Master Jianzhen of Daming Temple. He responded to the invitation and came to Japan, but the difficulties en route were extremely numerous and could not be helped. For twelve years he endured hardships at sea, encountering adverse waves six times, yet his aspiration never wearied. On the sixth attempt, he finally arrived in Japan and was invited into Tōdai-ji Temple. Emperor Shōmu, princes, and court officials were overjoyed and delighted. They immediately built an ordination platform in front of the Vairocana Hall and conducted ordinations. The Emperor, Empress, and over four hundred others all received ordination. Later they moved west of the Great Buddha Hall and separately established the Ordination Platform Cloister. From then on, ordinations have been conducted yearly and continue uninterrupted to this day. Japan

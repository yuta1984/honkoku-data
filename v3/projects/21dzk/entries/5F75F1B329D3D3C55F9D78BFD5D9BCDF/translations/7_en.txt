Third is precept practice—receiving and following maintenance while operating the three karmas. Fourth is precept characteristics—virtues manifest externally and the maintained characteristics can serve as standards. All precepts fully possess these four aspects.

Question: The Four-Part establishment of the present school and the intention of Patriarch Nanshan—what practice and fruition do they originally aim for among Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna?

Answer: What this teaching depends upon is originally Hīnayāna, because the original Four-Part Vinaya was originally directed toward Hīnayāna. However, its doctrine corresponds to Mahāyāna because spiritual capacities gradually advance. As it is provisionally Hīnayāna, the Lesser [Vehicle] excludes nothing. As it partially penetrates to Mahāyāna, the Greater [Vehicle] expects everything. This is the purport of what the present teaching explains. If we consider Vinaya Patriarch Nanshan's intention: the dharma gates taught throughout the Tathāgata's lifetime, all the great and lesser teachings, are divided into three teachings. First is the emptiness-of-nature teaching—all Hīnayāna is included within this. Second is the emptiness-of-characteristics teaching—all shallow Mahāyāna teachings are completely included. Third is the Consciousness-Only perfect teaching—all profound Mahāyāna teachings are completely included. The present Four-Part school is one division within the emptiness-of-nature teaching. The Consciousness-Only perfect teaching is what the patriarch aimed his mind toward, because it perfectly harmonizes the three studies in unobstructed perfect practice. In the Karma Commentary, he clarifies the precept essence discussed by various schools, presenting three school doctrines. The Existence school and Emptiness school are both included in the emptiness-of-nature teaching. The perfect teaching's wondrous essence is the Consciousness-Only teaching. The great and lesser schools each establish the three studies. Now, the three studies of Mahāyāna perfect teaching are: precept protection is the three collections of pure precepts, taking storehouse consciousness seeds as their essence. Concentration and wisdom are Consciousness-Only wondrous practices, operating both calm-abiding and insight together as their characteristics. Precepts are concentration and wisdom—there is no single dharma that is not concentration and wisdom. Concentration and wisdom are precepts—there is no single dharma that is not precepts. This is called the perfectly harmonized characteristics of the three studies' practices. The precepts within this are the three collections of pure precepts mentioned earlier. Namely, the precepts for restraining discipline completely abandon all evils. The precepts for cultivating good dharmas completely cultivate

all good practices. The precepts for benefiting sentient beings bear the burden of sentient beings and universally bestow benefits. These three collections are also perfectly harmonized practices. Therefore the three collections mutually encompass each other, and all precepts interpenetrate. Like not killing living beings—it contains all three collections. Even all other precepts are thus. Following the maintenance of one precept, the three collections are fully present. Though it is one practice, it extensively encompasses myriad practices. Therefore, though one thought-moment, it immediately traverses three great kalpas. Without destroying the three kalpas, one establishes one moment. Without retreating from one moment, one traverses three kalpas. Long and short are unobstructed, sentient beings and buddhas are equal. All dharmas mutually pervade each other, mutually identical and inexhaustible. How could this not be profound and wondrous? Cultivating good and benefiting beings are briefly omitted from discussion. Those disciplinary precepts also have three types: first, individual liberation precepts; second, precepts shared with concentration; third, precepts shared with the path. Within the first individual liberation, there are three karmas—precepts maintained by body, speech, and mind. The two precepts of body and speech have shared and unshared aspects. Mind karma precepts are only unshared. Therefore what śrāvakas receive is only the body and speech portion—the scope of the shared gate. The precept characteristics explained in the Four-Part Vinaya, etc., are precisely this scope. However, the Four-Part Vinaya partially penetrates to mind precepts. Due to this doctrine, there are Hīnayāna precepts. In the present Mahāyāna school, these shared gate precepts are incorporated into the three collections and return to Mahāyāna. Therefore the precept practices explained in Hīnayāna vinayas are all three-collection perfect sudden great precepts. There are no separate characteristics—purely one and perfectly ultimate. Those seven assembly standards are completely the same as the lesser vinaya, because they are established within disciplinary precepts. This is Nanshan Great Master's doctrinal contemplation principle—the aimed mind of students in receiving, following, understanding, and practicing. However, receiving these three-collection precepts has comprehensive receiving and separate receiving. Because the three collections are comprehensively received, it is called comprehensive. Because discipline is separately received, it is called separate. What the present patriarch established—the white-four karmavācanā perfect-intention precept dharma—corresponds to that separate receiving. Thereafter

receiving bodhisattva precepts corresponds to comprehensive receiving. Therefore present Vinaya school students encompass both comprehensive and separate receiving throughout the ordination platform. Both Four-Part and Brahmajāla protect the precept characteristics. The names of comprehensive and separate receiving emerge from the Dharma Characteristics school. The doctrine resides in Nanshan's forest. The system of five categories and seven groups arises from śrāvaka assemblies, while practice extends to the Mahāyāna garden. This is clear—the sincere teaching of the great Yogācāra treatise, the definitive judgment of Nanshan High Patriarch. The practitioner's aimed mind resides solely in this school. How could the great awakening's wondrous fruition be distant?

Dharma Characteristics School

Question: Why is it called the Dharma Characteristics School?

Answer: Because it determines and judges the natures and characteristics of all dharmas, it is called the Dharma Characteristics School. Speaking broadly of this school, there are four names in total. First, it is called the Consciousness-Only School because the great intention of this school is to clarify consciousness-only. Second, it is called the School of Accordance with Principle and Perfect Reality because all dharma gates accord with principle. Third, it is called the Universal Vehicle Teaching because it encompasses the five vehicles. Fourth, it is called the Dharma Characteristics School, whose meaning is as stated above. Now we raise one of these.

Question: On what sūtras and treatises does this school depend?

Answer: In the Consciousness-Only Treatise, six sūtras and eleven treatises are cited. The six sūtras are: Avataṃsaka, Saṃdhinirmocana, Tathāgatotpattiguṇa-alaṃkāra, Abhidharma, Laṅkāvatāra, and Ghanavyūha. The eleven treatises are: Yogācāra, Prakaraṇa, Alaṃkāra, Pramāṇasamuccaya, Mahāyāna-saṃgraha, Daśabhūmi, Yogavibhāga, Madhyāntavibhāga, Viṃśatikā-vijñaptimātratā, Ālambanaparīkṣā, and Abhidharmasamuccaya. If speaking generally, the five great treatises, ten branch treatises, etc., are all their foundations. However, the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, Yogācāra Treatise, Consciousness-Only Treatise, etc., particularly serve as study guides.

Question: Who does this teaching take as patriarch?

Answer: This teaching's successive transmission through three countries is clear. Nine hundred years after the Tathāgata's extinction, Bodhisattva Maitreya descended from Tuṣita Heaven to Central India's A-

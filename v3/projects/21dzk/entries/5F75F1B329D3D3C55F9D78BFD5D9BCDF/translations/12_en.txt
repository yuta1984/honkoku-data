[The school] widely transmitted this tradition. Hye Gwan transmitted to Meditation Master Fukuryō, Fukuryō transmitted to Meditation Master Chizō. Chizō transmitted to both Vinaya Master Dōji and Vinaya Master Raikō. Dōji transmitted to Great Virtue Zengi, Zengi transmitted to Meditation Master Gonsō, and Gonsō transmitted to Great Virtue Anchō. Thus the transmission continued without interruption to the present day, with brilliant masters emerging successively and mutually propagating the great teaching. How clear this is! Because the transmission through the three countries (India, China, Japan) has not fallen away, Tripiṭaka Yijing said: "In India there are two schools: Yogācāra and Madhyamaka." The doctrines are extremely profound—what school could match this? Puki Dōra said: "The four rivers flow from the same source at Lake Anavatapta. The seven schools take different paths but all emerge from the Three Treatises." One should know: all schools are branches of the Three Treatises, and the Three Treatises are the root of all schools. How could there be any school that does not enter Nāgārjuna's treasury of mind? All schools revere him as the great patriarch.

**Tiantai School**

Question: Why is it called the Tiantai School?

Answer: It is named after the mountain. This school arose from that mountain.

Question: What teaching does this school rely upon?

Answer: It takes the Lotus Sūtra as its fundamental base sūtra and uses it to classify all teachings of one lifetime. However, in the comprehensive network of doctrinal classification, all principles are cited. Therefore Master Yiren's "Doctrinal Principles" states: "The doctrinal teachings used by our school take the Lotus as the essential framework, the Treatise on Great Wisdom as guidance, the Great Sūtra as support, and the Great Perfection of Wisdom as contemplative method. We cite various sūtras to increase faith and cite various treatises for assistance. Contemplation of mind serves as warp, all dharmas as weft, weaving together volumes that are unlike any others."

Question: Who does this school regard as patriarch?

Answer: It regards Great Master Zhiyi of Tiantai as the founding master. However, Chan Master Huiwen established the three contemplations in one mind based on the Treatise on Great Wisdom and transmitted this to Chan Master Huisi of Nanyue. Chan Master Huisi heard the Lotus Sūtra at Vulture Peak, remembered being present at that time, practiced the Lotus Samādhi, and attained the stage of purification of the six sense organs. He wonderfully comprehended the passage from the Treatise on Great Wisdom about "obtaining the three wisdoms in one mind" and the three truths verse from the Madhyamaka treatise, deeply developed concentration and wisdom, achieved samādhi, and his contemplative understanding became perfectly clear. He then transmitted this to Great Master Zhiyi of Tiantai. Great Master Zhiyi had also formerly heard the Lotus Sūtra at Vulture Peak, and when he met Great Master Nanyue, he wonderfully gained remembrance, cultivated the Lotus Samādhi, reached the stage of the five grades, and established the great school of our lineage. He embodied the ten virtues. Huiwen and Nanyue only provided the doctrinal framework, but when it reached Great Master Tiantai, he extensively established the temporal teachings and comprehensively classified one lifetime of teachings. The flourishing of this school rests entirely with this patriarch. Next was Great Master Zhangan, who succeeded Great Master Tiantai and widely transmitted this school. Tiantai only gave scattered teachings, but Zhangan compiled them all, completing the canonical texts of one school and creating the outline of one lineage. Next, Great Master Zhiwei succeeded Great Master Zhangan and widely transmitted this school. Zhiwei transmitted to Great Master Huiwei, Huiwei to Great Master Xuanlang, and Xuanlang to Great Master Miaole. Great Master Miaole extensively interpreted the patriarchal texts and composed commentarial works. Corresponding to Tiantai's "Great Calming and Contemplation," "Profound Meaning," and "Words and Phrases," he composed the "Auxiliary Practices," "Explanatory Notes," and "Commentary Records." The commentarial works of other schools do not match this master. There are no other patriarchal texts that he did not interpret and explain. Therefore he has been especially relied upon through ancient and modern times, and all quarters look to him as their foundation. Only our school's commentaries wonderfully captured the patriarchal intention and quite well accord with the great tradition. Dharma Masters Yitong, Zhili, Jingjue and others all succeeded after this period. Great Master Miaole transmitted the Dharma to Monk Daosui, who was the spiritual treasury of the dharma-gate. Xingman, Daoluo, Zhiyun and others all received from Miaole, working shoulder to shoulder in propagating the teaching, mutually becoming

dragons and elephants. Thus Japan's Great Master Dengyō crossed over to the Tang country, met Monk Daosui, and extensively received this school's transmission. Like pouring from one vessel to another with nothing left behind, the transmission was complete. He then returned to Japan and propagated it on Mount Hiei. Monk Gishin, Great Master Jikaku, Great Master Chishō—such patriarchs and virtuous predecessors mutually transmitted the lineage, continuing without interruption to the present. Throughout the entire country of Japan there is no place it is not propagated, and we hear it is flourishingly studied in foreign countries and continents as well. Though this is the age of the final Dharma, people's reverence and devotion does not surpass this school. How noble! How great!

Question: How many temporal teachings does this school establish to classify the teachings of one lifetime, and what dharma-gates does it clarify?

Answer: The great teaching of one school consists of two gates: doctrine and contemplation. Speaking of the doctrinal gate: through doctrinal understanding one nourishes the spirit, and the Buddha-way opens perfectly. Speaking of the contemplative gate: through contemplative practice one progressively advances, and enlightened awakening wonderfully manifests. The doctrinal gate includes the four teachings, five flavors, one vehicle, ten suchnesses, etc. The contemplative gate includes twelve-link dependent origination, two truths, four types of samādhi, three delusions teachings, etc. In classifying the teachings of one lifetime, regarding doctrine there are four teachings, regarding time there are five periods. Within the four teachings there are also two types. First are the four teachings of transformation methods, which are the outline for doctrinal interpretation. Second are the four teachings of transformation manner, which are the great framework for doctrinal classification. Combining both types of four teachings makes eight teachings.

Question: What are the four teachings of transformation methods?

Answer: First, the Tripiṭaka Teaching. All Hīnayāna teachings are included within this teaching. Second, the Shared Teaching. Among various Mahāyāna teachings, those that universally address the three vehicles fall within this teaching's scope. Third, the Distinct Teaching. Among various Mahāyāna teachings, those that are not shared with the lesser vehicle but exclusively address bodhisattvas are included in this teaching. Fourth, the Perfect Teaching. Among various Mahāyāna teachings, the perfectly interfused, mutually identical, unobstructed dharma-gates are included in this teaching. Regarding the first Tripiṭaka Teaching: within Hīnayāna teachings the various schools divided into streams, but taking the essentials there are only four. First, the existence-gate Hīnayāna,

which is the Abhidharma. Second, the emptiness-gate Hīnayāna, which is the Satyasiddhi treatise. Third, the both-existence-and-emptiness gate, namely the Vibhāṣā treatise. Fourth, the neither-existence-nor-emptiness, which is the Kātyāyana sūtra. That Vibhāṣā treatise and Kātyāyana sūtra have not yet been transmitted to China. Let me explain in detail according to what the existence-gate Abhidharma teaches.

Within this teaching, the characteristics of the three vehicles' cultivation and attainment of fruit are clarified. First, the śrāvaka vehicle has seven worthies and seven sages. The seven worthies are: first, five contemplations for stopping; second, separate mindfulness of body; third, general mindfulness of body. These three are the outer ordinary stage of conforming to liberation. Fourth, warmth dharma; fifth, peak dharma; sixth, forbearance dharma; seventh, supreme worldly dharma. These four are the inner ordinary stage of conforming to decisive selection. The seven sages are: first, follower of faith; second, follower of dharma; third, faith-liberated; fourth, view-attainer; fifth, body-witness; sixth, time-liberated; seventh, not-time-liberated. The first two are both the path of seeing. Those of dull faculties are called followers of faith; those of sharp faculties are called followers of dharma. When dull-facultied ones enter the path of cultivation they are called faith-liberated; when sharp-facultied ones enter the path of cultivation they are called view-attainers. When these two types—faith-liberated and view-attainers—attain the cessation concentration, they are called body-witness. When dull-facultied people attain arhat fruit they are called time-liberated; when sharp-facultied people attain arhat fruit they are called not-time-liberated. Though there are seven sages, they are only the four fruit śrāvakas. Attaining fruit takes at fastest three lifetimes, at slowest sixty eons to achieve realization. The pratyekabuddha vehicle has two types: First, group-practicing solitary awakeners; second, rhinoceros-horn solitary awakeners. Group-practitioners appear during Buddha's lifetime, so there are many of this type. Rhinoceros-horn types are solitary, so they do not know of Buddha's lifetime. At fastest four lifetimes, at slowest one hundred eons, they attain fruit. Bodhisattvas pass through three asaṃkhyeya eons and also one hundred eons, then afterward become Buddha under the bodhi tree. All three vehicles cut off view and thought delusions. The three vehicles

Question: Why is it called the Huayan School?

Answer: Because it takes the Avataṃsaka Sūtra as its foundation, it is called thus.

Question: How many Avataṃsaka Sūtras are there in total?

Answer: If we discuss in detail, there are ten distinct categories. However, taking the essential point, there are only three versions. The upper Avataṃsaka has verses numbering like the dust particles of ten trillion great thousandfold worlds, with chapters numbering like the dust particles of one four-continent world system. The middle Avataṃsaka has 498,800 verses and 1,200 chapters. These two versions are stored in the dragon palace and were not transmitted to Jambudvīpa. The lower Avataṃsaka has 100,000 verses and 38 chapters. This was transmitted to Jambudvīpa and flourished greatly in the five regions of India. These are called the three Avataṃsaka texts. From the 100,000 verses of the lower version transmitted and translated to China, there were three translations. During the Eastern Jin dynasty, Tripiṭaka Master Buddhabhadra translated it into 60 volumes, obtaining 36,000 verses from the Sanskrit original. Next, during the great Tang dynasty, Tripiṭaka Master Śikṣānanda translated it into 80 volumes, obtaining 45,000 verses from the Sanskrit original. Later, during the great Tang dynasty, Tripiṭaka Master Prajñā translated it into 40 volumes during the Zhenyuan period, which consisted only of the single chapter "Entering the Dharma-realm."

Question: Who does this school regard as its patriarch?

Answer: Master Fazang is regarded as the high patriarch. However, specifically speaking, seven patriarchs are established. The first is Bodhisattva Aśvaghoṣa. The second is Bodhisattva Nāgārjuna. The third is Dhyāna Master Dushun, the founding patriarch of China. He was a manifestation of Mañjuśrī, resided on Mt. Zhongnan, composed the Huayan Dharmadhātu Contemplation, Five Teachings Samatha-Vipaśyanā, Ten Mysterious Gates chapter, etc., and transmitted this school. His posthumous title was Honored One of the Emperor's Mind. The fourth is Dhyāna Master Zhiyan. Succeeding Master Dushun, he greatly propagated this school with many compositions. He resided at Yunhua Temple and was called Honored One Yunhua. The fifth is Master Fazang. Learning from Dhyāna Master Zhiyan, he widely expounded the Avataṃsaka teachings. He became the nation's teacher and

became a treasure of the four seas. When he lectured on sūtras, flowers rained from heaven in response, and when he expounded meanings, five lights emerged from his mouth. The great Tang Empress Wu Zetian bestowed upon him the posthumous title Bodhisattva Xianshou. His commentaries on sūtras and treatises were extremely numerous—fundamental commentaries on major sūtras, separate chapters on other sūtras, doctrinal records on various treatises, comprehensive teachings of the school—his explanations left nothing out and exhaustively described the principles and meanings. The great flourishing of Avataṃsaka teachings was entirely due to this patriarch. The sixth is Master Qingliang. Succeeding Master Fazang, he propagated the Avataṃsaka teaching. His wisdom and understanding were profound and broad, comprehending all schools while making this perfect teaching his heart's treasury. He composed the Great Commentary, Yanyi Commentary, and many other chapters and commentaries. The entire dynasty took refuge in his teachings and made him national teacher. His ten vows were firm, and he never slackened throughout his life. He resided on Mt. Qingliang and received the posthumous title Bodhisattva Huayan. The seventh is Dhyāna Master Zongmi. Succeeding Master Qingliang, he greatly propagated Avataṃsaka teachings while comprehending all schools. His compositions were very numerous. He resided at Guifeng Caotang Temple and received the posthumous title Dhyāna Master Dinghui. These seven patriarchs were recorded by Dharma Master Jingyuan by imperial command. If we consider only China, from Dushun downward, only five patriarchs are established. In Japan's appreciation, four patriarchs are especially revered: Dushun, Zhiyan, Fazang, and Chengguan. For transmission to Japan, Vinaya Master Daoxuan was the founding patriarch. The Vinaya Master learned from Master Fazang, and the Vinaya Master transmitted to Abbot Rōben. From then until now, the lineage has continued, the dharma-transmission bloodline has been maintained without interruption.

Question: How many teachings does this school establish to encompass the dharma-gates of one lifetime?

Answer: It establishes five teachings and two schools to encompass the dharma-gates of one lifetime. The five teachings are: first, Hinayana teaching; second, Mahayana initial teaching; third, Mahayana final teaching; fourth, sudden teaching; fifth, perfect teaching. The first Hinayana teaching: when the Tathāgata appeared in the world to teach the one vehicle and transform sentient beings, he taught the fundamental one vehicle teaching under the Bodhi tree.

Just as high mountains first receive light and gain great benefit, when the sun first shines forth it awakens the various capacities. However, beings of small aspiration cannot bear to hear the profound dharma. Therefore, within the one vehicle, the Tathāgata distinguished the three vehicles, gradually enticing shallow capacities to make them approach the great path. The Hinayana teaching within this is the Tathāgata's provisional dharma establishment. Temporarily granting the sheep and deer carts to entice those of small aspiration, provisionally establishing the conjured city to give rest from toil. Therefore, the principles and meanings taught follow the shallow and near capacities, and the fruits and realizations attained exist only in narrow inferiority. Through such enticement and gathering, they are gradually led to approach the Mahayana.

Question: What is the character of the principles and meanings taught within this teaching?

Answer: The principles and meanings taught are numerous and immeasurable. Mentioning just one or two: speaking of dharma-characteristics, there are seventy-five numbers, with the characteristics of conditioned and unconditioned being distinct. Discussing dharma-sources, there are six consciousnesses and three poisons, with the meanings of defiled and undefiled being apparent. The realization and entry of four fruits exists only in entering quiescence; the three-eon progression focuses exclusively on the five divisions. The banners of heterodox wrong views shatter like dust, and the clouds of birth-death view-and-thought delusions clear like clouds. However, because the dharma-source is not yet exhausted, controversies are extremely numerous. The sectarian groups of twenty schools represent the appearance of this teaching.

Next, the Mahayana initial teaching: since this teaching has emerged from Hinayana and begun to enter Mahayana, though it slightly resembles the small teaching, it mostly discusses the profound meaning of direct advancement. Through three-eon cultivation, one approaches the great fruit of ultimate realization; through manifesting and realizing the two emptinesses, one rises high above the sentiments of the partial and small. The hundred dharmas are clear as a mirror, with decisive analysis being distinct. Therefore controversies cease and the dharma-garden becomes peaceful. The four wisdom mind-groups shine clearly as the moon of self-benefit; the three-body wondrous fruits are perfectly round as the light of elimination and realization. Through establishing the eight consciousnesses, dharma-characteristics are widely extended; through the two-truths dharma-gate, there are layers of profound depths. Through subduing and eliminating the two obstructions, various delusions melt like ice; through cultivating the six perfections, self and others advance together. The wondrous principle is remote

and distant, truly not what the Hinayana can glimpse. The great meaning is profoundly mysterious, far transcending the provisional carts of sheep and deer. However, true suchness has no cognition, the path of dependent origination is not yet penetrated, phenomena and principle do not merge, and the gate of mutual interpenetration is not yet opened. Therefore the five natures divide capacities, in transcending the world there is attainment and non-attainment, among the two vehicles there are differences, regarding Buddha-fruit there is approaching and non-approaching established. This is the separation of those with and without [Buddha-]nature, the differences between determined and undetermined natures. Therefore in this teaching, those without nature do not transcend birth-and-death, and those of determined nature have absolutely no turning of mind—this is precisely this teaching's meaning. Though it transcends the factions of Mahāsāṅghika and Sthavira, it has not yet reached the discussion where all follow conditions and achieve [Buddhahood]. The name "initial teaching" truly derives from this.

Next, the final teaching: in this teaching all characteristics interpenetrate and merge, entering the samādhi-gate of non-duality. True suchness follows conditions, flourishing the dharma-garden of all phenomena. Therefore the Tathāgatagarbha ocean pervades the eight consciousnesses like ice and water, those with and without nature all proclaim achievement like empty space. Other-dependent naturelessness is precisely perfect accomplishment. Sentient beings' afflictions are precisely nirvāṇa. The first-meaning emptiness encompasses true and false in vastness; arising, abiding, change, and cessation transcend samādhi in absolute transcendence. This is precisely the profound meaning of Mahayana, which is exhausted within this. The establishment of dharma-meanings already reaches completion in this teaching. However, it does not yet discuss the non-obstruction between phenomena and phenomena, does not yet clarify the completeness of principal and auxiliary [dharmas]. Also, the gate of complete extinction is not yet terminated, and the characteristics of ascending progression establish stages. Therefore it is still called gradual teaching.

Next, the sudden teaching: in this teaching, when one thought does not arise, this is called Buddha. All differences in dharma-characteristics are completely annihilated, and the wondrous principle of true nature is directly manifested. Everything that exists is only false thinking. The entire dharma-realm is complete transcendence of words. The five dharmas and three self-natures are all empty and annihilated, the eight consciousnesses and two selflessnesses are both rejected and dismissed. All stages are completely extinguished, Buddha is also entirely transcended. However, one does not yet know that all the luxuriant phenomena are all Vairocana's fruition-virtues, and that all the vast characteristics are the Buddha-ocean.

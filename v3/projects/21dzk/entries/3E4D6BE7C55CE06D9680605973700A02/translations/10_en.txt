Because it is solely the doctrine of Amida, though it is said to have no oral transmissions, the sectarian teachings are not lacking. It differs greatly from the spiritual ground of other schools. In the present world there is something called the "Five-Fold Transmission." Someone says this did not exist in ancient times. In former times in foreign lands, patriarchs of various schools practicing nenbutsu was quite frequent. See the "Chapter on Patriarchs Pointing to the Pure Land" in the "Collection of Direct Pointing to the Source" and others. However, properly establishing the Pure Land school was only among the descendants of Daochuo and Shandao. In our country too, practicing the nenbutsu gate was flourishing, as with Kūya Shōnin, Eshin Sōzu and others. However, properly establishing the Pure Land school as a separate school has been since Hōnen Shōnin. Since this has already been classified as a "lodged school," it is now placed at the end for the time being. Also, someone composed a "Pure Land Lineage Treatise" recording the master-disciple lineage from the fifty-three Buddhas onward. However, there is no record in various transmissions of direct transmission from Master Shangtong to Zen Master Daochuo. Also, there is no precedent for considering dream-reception as direct transmission. Dream-reception is simply an auspicious sign of faith in Buddha. Therefore it is difficult to call it a true lineage. For the dull faculties of sinful beings in the latter age, the Pure Land gate is the most excellent and foremost.

The above ten schools are completed.

Additional Notes

1. That Tendai school practice has five branches
2. That Lotus Sūtra practice has two types: with characteristics and without characteristics
3. That within practice with characteristics there are "mere recitation" and "meaningful recitation"
4. The differences between Eshin-style and Zendō-style nenbutsu
5. That the Nichiren school consists of slanderers of the dharma and evil people

Question: What kind of practice should people of the Tendai school specialize in?

Answer: Other schools are like streams and rivers, each practicing one particular method. First, people of Sanron, Hossō, Kegon, Kusha, and Jōjitsu schools, though differing in great/small and provisional/real, each practice the contemplation of their respective schools. People of the Ritsu school maintain the precepts. The Shingon school practices esoteric methods. The Zen school makes seated meditation and spiritual effort their work. The Pure Land school practices nenbutsu. The present Tendai school is like a great ocean, encompassing all myriad practices. Therefore there are practices of five branches: Tendai, esoteric, Zen, precepts, and nenbutsu. Whichever it may be, one should practice according to one's spiritual capacity. When practicing the Buddha-dharma, one must first know the distinction between capacity and dharma. No matter how lofty and great the dharma may be, if the dharma

does not accord with one's own spiritual faculties, it will be difficult to put to present use. Therefore one should listen well to the dharma gates of various streams, apply them to oneself with effort, and practice the dharma that accords with one's own faculties. First, "Tendai" means practicing the Lotus Sūtra. This is the primary practice of the Tendai school. This again has two aspects. First is the peaceful practice without characteristics. This contemplates the six sense faculties through the wonderful principle of the Lotus Sūtra: one-thought-three-thousand and the three truths. It is the contemplation method of constant objects without characteristics and constant wisdom without conditions. This is practice for superior faculties. When this contemplation is accomplished, one immediately becomes Buddha. Second is the peaceful practice with characteristics. This does not enter into dhyāna samādhi but wholeheartedly recites the Lotus Sūtra. Chanting the title is also within the practice of recitation. This again has two types: mere recitation and meaningful recitation. Mere recitation means reciting without error in every word and phrase, not mistaking the tones of broad, narrow, questioning, alone, level, rising, departing, and entering. Meaningful recitation means reading while contemplating every word and phrase as the three truths and true characteristics. When this meaningful recitation is accomplished, one immediately sees Samantabhadra Bodhisattva and obtains the approximate purification of the six faculties. It is not direct buddhahood. If people of the Tendai school wish to practice the Lotus Sūtra, they should undertake whichever of the two peaceful practices—with or without characteristics. Next, "esoteric" refers to what Dengyō Daishi and Jikaku

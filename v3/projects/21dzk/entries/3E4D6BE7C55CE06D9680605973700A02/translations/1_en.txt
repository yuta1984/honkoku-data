the Sanlun school, fifth the Nirvana school, sixth the Pure Land school, seventh the Dilun school, eighth the Chan school, ninth the Shelun school, tenth the Tiantai school, eleventh the Huayan school, twelfth the Faxiang school, and thirteenth the Shingon school. Among these thirteen schools, three schools—the Nirvana school, Dilun school, and Shelun school—did not transmit to Japan, while the remaining ten schools exist in Japan.

The initial transmission of Buddhism to our imperial court occurred in the thirteenth year of Emperor Kinmei's reign (552 CE), in the year of the water monkey, in the tenth month, when Buddhism was first transmitted from the kingdom of Baekje. However, there was no one to propagate it vigorously. In the second year of the thirty-first emperor, Emperor Bidatsu, Prince Shōtoku was born, and from the age of six or seven he began studying Buddhist scriptures. Because Minister Mononobe no Moriya attempted to destroy Buddhism, the Prince at age fifteen punished Moriya and greatly promoted Buddhism. Later, during the reign of the thirty-fourth emperor, Empress Suiko, Buddhism was actively transmitted, but it was all Buddhism that had come from Baekje. The Buddhism of the Sui dynasty had not yet been transmitted. Gradually, Buddhist schools were transmitted from foreign countries, and in total there came to be ten schools in our country.

The character "shū" (sect) is read as "son" (revere) or "shu" (master). A house that reveres and takes as its master a particular teaching is called that sect. First is the Sanlun school, second the Faxiang school, third the Huayan school, fourth the Abhidharmakośa school, fifth the Satyasiddhi school, sixth the Vinaya school, seventh the Tiantai school, eighth the Shingon school, ninth the Chan school, and tenth the Pure Land school.

**1. Sanlun School (Three Treatises School)**
After the Buddha's parinirvana, in India, among the numerous treatises composed by Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva, there are the commentaries called the "Middle Treatise" and "Twelve Gate Treatise." There is also a treatise called the "Hundred Treatise" by Āryadeva Bodhisattva (Nāgārjuna's disciple). These three treatises—Middle, Twelve Gate, and Hundred—are collectively called the "Three Treatises" (when the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra is added, it is called the Four Treatises School). This school expounds the Prajñāpāramitā principle that all phenomena are empty. Bhāvaviveka Bodhisattva established this sectarian doctrine. It is the teaching that views all phenomena as empty and without characteristics, thereby abandoning attachments.

In China, during the Later Qin period, the Tripiṭaka master Kumārajīva transmitted this Sanlun school from India. Chinese Sanlun takes Kumārajīva as its founding patriarch. A monk named Huiguan from Goguryeo went to the Sui dynasty and studied the Sanlun school under Master Jizang of Jiaxiang, then came to Japan from Goguryeo in the first month of the thirty-third year of Empress Suiko's reign (625 CE), year of the wood rooster, and propagated this school. By imperial decree, he was made to reside at Gangō-ji temple in Yamato Province. Japanese Sanlun takes Huiguan as its founding patriarch. Later, various masters studied this teaching. It is properly transmitted at Tōdai-ji temple in the southern capital. The Sanlun temple is the Tōnan-in within Tōdai-ji.

This school's teaching includes the concepts of "Two Repositories and Three Turnings of the Dharma Wheel." The Two Repositories are: first, the Śrāvaka Repository, which encompasses the various Hīnayāna schools; second, the Bodhisattva Repository, which encompasses the various Mahāyāna schools. The Three Turnings of the Dharma Wheel are: first, the Fundamental Turning of the Dharma Wheel, which is the Avataṃsaka Sutra; second, the Branch Turning of the Dharma Wheel, which includes the Āgama, Vaipulya, and Prajñāpāramitā; third, the Turning that Gathers the Branches Back to the Root, which includes the Lotus and Nirvana sutras.

The school also has the doctrine of the "Eight Negations of the Middle Way": neither arising nor ceasing, neither permanent nor断, neither one nor different, neither coming nor going. This appears in the Middle Treatise. It views all phenomena as being like mirror images and moon reflections in water—empty, tranquil, without characteristics, and lacking substantial existence—thereby not being attached to phenomena. This principle is exclusively maintained. Although it claims to discuss profound meanings, when viewed from the perspective of the Perfect School, the Sanlun school represents only a portion of the provisional Mahāyāna's principle of emptiness, not the fundamental emptiness of true Mahāyāna.

**2. Faxiang School (Yogācāra School)**
It is called the Faxiang school because it exclusively establishes the differentiated characteristics of phenomena. Generally speaking, it relies on numerous sutras and treatises, but specifically it takes the Saṃdhinirmocana Sutra of the Vaipulya section as its source, relies on the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra as its foundation, and makes the Vijñaptimātra treatises its doctrinal essence. It establishes the Three Period Teaching and clarifies the Five Distinct Natures.

The Three Period Teaching is established based on the Saṃdhinirmocana Sutra and Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra. The First Period Teaching is called the "Teaching with Characteristics," explaining the characteristics of person-emptiness and dharma-existence found in the Āgama and other Hīnayāna scriptures. The Second Period Teaching is called the "Teaching without Characteristics," explaining the characteristics of emptiness of both persons and dharmas found in the various Prajñāpāramitā sutras. The Third Period Teaching is called the "Teaching of Neither Existence nor Emptiness," explaining the characteristics of neither emptiness nor existence of both persons and dharmas found in the Avataṃsaka, Saṃdhinirmocana, Vimalakīrti, Lotus, Nirvana, and other great Mahāyāna teachings.

The Five Distinct Natures are established based on the Laṅkāvatāra Sutra and Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra: first, śrāvaka-vehicle nature; second, pratyekabuddha-vehicle nature; third, tathāgata nature; fourth, indeterminate-vehicle nature; fifth, no-nature. No-nature is called icchantika. These five natures are permanently distinct, and it is taught that three of them—śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and those of no-nature—will never attain Buddhahood.

Therefore, it holds to the doctrine that the three vehicles are real and the one vehicle is expedient, and does not clarify tathatā dependent origination. It also establishes the teaching of the Three Natures: parikalpita (imagined nature), paratantra (dependent nature), and pariniṣpanna (perfected nature). Parikalpita refers to the forms of the six realms and four types of birth that appear when one develops attachment to real self and real dharmas in the merely conditional characteristics of dependent causal combination. That ignorant ordinary beings become inverted, generate afflictions, create karma, and experience suffering is entirely the fault of discriminative false conceptualization.

Paratantra means that all sentient beings have eight consciousnesses, and because the seeds of all dharmas are completely present in the eighth ālaya-vijñāna (storehouse consciousness), when causes and conditions temporarily combine, phenomena appear that are not truly existent yet seem to exist...

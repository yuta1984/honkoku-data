Therefore, saying "illuminating ultimate truth" refers to the transformed aspect-part. Because it is conventional truth, it is said to "take conventional truth as object." Next, regarding view and cultivation afflictions, what the fifth ground subdues is: although cultivation delusions are subdued and severed at preceding and following grounds, removing accompanying subsidiary latent afflictions is this ground's special capacity. Therefore it is said to subdue cultivation delusions. Generally subduing cultivation delusions is not called this ground's superior capacity. Next, regarding view and cultivation delusions, this is explained in terms of where they are exhausted. It does not mean they are subdued at the fifth ground. For example, in the Buddha Ground Sūtra, when explaining fourth ground bodhisattvas, it says they sever both discriminative and co-arising types of self-view - this speaks in terms of where they are exhausted.

Question: In the sūtra's clarification of the ten pāramitās, is the sixth prajñā pāramitā limited only to fundamental wisdom, or how should this be understood? If it is limited to fundamental wisdom, looking at the sūtra's present text, in clarifying the prajñā pāramitā, it speaks of delighting in the buddhas and tathāgatas' profound dharmas and describes penetrating the dharmas of the five sciences. It can be known that it extends to subsequently attained wisdom. According to this, Master Cízhōu explains it as extending to subsequently attained wisdom. If this is so, in the establishment of the ten pāramitās, the sixth is limited only to fundamental wisdom. If it extends to subsequently attained wisdom, how does it differ from the tenth wisdom pāramitā? Here, in the Vijñānavāda Treatise: "The sixth only includes non-discriminating wisdom." How should this be understood?

Also objecting: In the Xuánzàn Commentary: "The latter five pāramitās all have subsequently attained wisdom as their nature." This explanation also shows that the sixth prajñā is subsequently attained wisdom. How should this be understood?

There is a question and answer: Regarding the Xuánzàn Commentary's explanation, this is not the Great Master's private interpretation. It quotes treatise text. Here we know

【Lower section】
the character "five" is a copying error. It should say "the latter four pāramitās all have subsequent wisdom as their nature." Or it speaks regarding the majority.

Someone says: Regarding the Xuánzàn Commentary's explanation, in the time of the six pāramitās, the sixth prajñā is included in subsequently attained wisdom. The reason is that it speaks thus by combining the six pāramitās and ten pāramitās. Or "having subsequently attained wisdom as nature" means the word "nature" takes fundamental wisdom which is the nature of subsequently attained wisdom. It is called the nature of subsequently attained wisdom. If so, does the present sūtra text describe the intention of combining the six degrees and ten degrees?

Does the Xuánzàn Commentary's explanation depend on the present sūtra text? The reconciling explanations are diverse, and it is difficult to reconcile the sūtra text with the Xuánzàn Commentary. Xuánzàn volume three says: "Regarding revealing essence: expedient means is wisdom, having wisdom as nature. Non-discriminating wisdom internally merges with the true realm. In subsequently attained wisdom, teaching dharma for others' benefit can give rise to expedient means' wondrous function. It has subsequent wisdom as nature. The Vijñānavāda and other [treatises] explain: the latter five pāramitās all have subsequently attained wisdom as their nature."

Question: The sūtra text [mentions] "ignorance that gives rise to various karmic actions." Is this ignorance within cognitive obscurations? Proceeding to say: In the commentary it states "among the two types of foolishness severed at the second ground, it is the foolishness of various karmic destinies." Therefore it is ignorance of cognitive obscurations. Regarding this: cognitive obscurations are not binding dharmas. How could they give rise to karmic actions? According to this, in the Vijñānavāda Treatise: "Having no capacity to generate karma or nourish birth." Cognitive obscurations definitely have no function of generating karma or nourishing birth. Then the explanation is unclear. How should this be understood?

Privately speaking: This matter is the commentary master's question and answer. Answering this: "Regarding being unable to generate karma that attracts birth in different realms and destinies with maturation

【Page 35】
【Upper section】
fruits, it is said not to generate karma. If unable to attract all three types of karma, these cognitive obscurations are not incapable of generation. The fruits are the two fruits of equal flow and superior causation." The meaning is: that cognitive obscurations do not generate karma means they do not generate karma that attracts maturation fruits of the three realms and five destinies. If it is not maturation fruit, they do generate karma that attracts equal flow and superior causation fruits. This is precisely the foolishness of various karmic destinies severed at the second ground. The present commentary explanation describes the ninth volume commentary explanation, so there is no error.

Question: The sūtra text [mentions] "At that time the Bodhisattva Lion Mark Unobstructed Light Flame." By what superior merit does he obtain this name? Proceeding to say: The commentary states "Being able to attain the bodhisattva's four unobstructed [knowledges], he is named Lion Mark. Being free from obstacles is called unobstructed. Attaining wisdom autonomy, being able to illuminate ultimate and conventional, he is named Light Flame." Regarding this: all bodhisattvas of deep stages possess these merits. Why does he alone obtain this name? Next, this bodhisattva's obtaining this name represents which ground? Obtaining the four unobstructed [knowledges] is the ninth ground's superior capacity. The word "unobstructed" represents the ninth. The designation "light flame" for combined observation of ultimate and conventional is the fifth ground's superior capacity. If so, explaining this name-obtaining does not reveal this bodhisattva's special name. The ground positions also become confused. How can this resolve the sūtra text's original meaning?

Privately speaking: Establishing particular names within the general is the constant practice of buddhas and bodhisattvas. Even if any bodhisattva possesses this capacity, what error is there in establishing a particular name? However, regarding indication of ground position, according to the commentary master's intention, it represents a ninth ground bodhisattva. The reason is: representing the four unobstructed [knowledges] and attaining wisdom autonomy reveals attaining the suchness that wisdom autonomy depends upon. Next, regarding illuminating ultimate and conventional, concerning confusion with the

【Lower section】
ninth ground, Master Xìng's commentary states: "Not depending on preparatory practices, ultimate and conventional wisdom arise like light." The meaning is that this ninth ground's combined observation of ultimate and conventional does not depend on preparatory practices but observes in combination without effort, thus differing from the fifth ground's effortful combined observation.

Question: In the Yogācāra Treatise's clarification of the ten types of arousing intention, should the "not-yet-accomplished-fruit arousing intention" include the ground of aspiration and action? Proceeding to say: In the commentary it appears not to be included. Regarding this: the words "not-yet-accomplished-fruit arousing intention" have nothing to exclude. Why not include that ground? Moreover, examining the Yogācāra Treatise text: "the ground of aspiration and action... up to the tenth ground." Then the explanation is unclear. How should this be understood?

Privately speaking: The not-yet-accomplished-fruit arousing intention should broadly extend to the aspiration ground. This is because the Yogācāra Treatise text is clear. However, regarding the commentary explanation: "not-yet-accomplished-fruit arousing intention refers to the causal stage" - the words "causal stage" are broad. Why reject that ground? It should extend to the five grounds.

Yogācāra volume 72 states: "Furthermore, there are ten arousing intentions... The not-yet-accomplished-fruit arousing intention refers to all arousing intention from the ground of aspiration and action up to the tenth ground. The already-accomplished-fruit arousing intention refers to all arousing intention of the tathāgata ground."

Question: In the Mañjuśrī's Questions on the Bodhi Mind Sūtra's explanation of the four types of arousing intention, is the first "initial arousing intention" among pre-ground or ground stages? There are problems on both sides. If it is the first ground, since it already says "initial arousing intention," why

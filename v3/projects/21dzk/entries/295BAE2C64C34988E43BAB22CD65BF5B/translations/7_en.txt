[the bodhisattva] sees the body. The previous inferior body characteristics become hidden, and the subsequent superior body characteristics become manifest. This is called "entering extinction and attaining enlightenment." This is not like transformation Buddhas where the previous Buddha enters extinction long ago and a separate Buddha attains Buddhahood. Therefore it says "this is not the same as transformation Buddhas appearing after passing through kalpas." If discussing separate Buddhas in terms of location, many kalpas pass between previous and subsequent Buddhas, as with Amitābha and Avalokiteśvara, etc.

Question: Are the response bodies explained in this sutra only bodies seen by the four good roots, or can they include other-enjoyment bodies of ground levels? Response: The commentary and chapter appear to include other-enjoyment bodies. Regarding this, when correctly examining the present text of the sutra, it says "possessing the thirty-two characteristics and eighty kinds of excellence" and states "this is a pre-ground body." The text about possessing thirty-two characteristics rejects the eighty-four thousand bodies of ground levels, explaining this as pre-ground bodies, limited to the transformative activities of the four good roots. Accordingly, in the Yilin chapter, explaining this sutra text, it says the transformative activities of the four good roots are lords of one great thousand-world system. Additionally, in the Xuanzan, when assigning these four phrases to the three bodies, the first three phrases are transformation bodies, and the last phrase is Dharma and reward bodies. If the first three phrases contained other-enjoyment bodies, why would they belong only to transformation bodies? The explanation is unclear. How should this be understood?

I say: There should be no doubt that the sutra text explains other-enjoyment bodies. Here, explaining the second body, it says "disciples have one intention, therefore one characteristic is manifested." One intention means realizing the principle of one-taste equality. One characteristic refers to one characteristic of the other-enjoyment Buddha body. Therefore, explaining this has no dispute in the sutra text. However, regarding saying "possessing thirty-two characteristics," the commentary explains this: other-enjoyment has two types - first, bodies seen by the four good roots; second, bodies seen by ground-level bodhisattvas. This

only explains bodies seen by those in the four good roots position. Next, regarding what is not explained in the sutra text, the Yilin chapter says other-enjoyment bodies are also included in this phrase, mentioning the first to reveal the later, abbreviated and not discussed. Otherwise, in which phrase would that body be included? The meaning is that the sutra text provisionally mentions the first to reveal the later; otherwise, in what would the transformative activities of the ten grounds be included? Next, regarding the Xuanzan's explanation, the transformative activities of the ten grounds vary in size and superiority/inferiority according to spiritual capacities, following ground positions. This is called "other-body." Actually, within those transformation bodies, there should be other-enjoyment. Since self-enjoyment bodies are purely unified, following the Dharma body, they belong to the latter phrase. The Three Bodies chapter's "changing and transforming according to circumstances, not being fixed" explains the transformative activities of the ten grounds, perhaps serving as evidence for this meaning.

Question: Can other-enjoyment bodies manifest non-Buddha forms like children, etc.? If they manifest them, other-enjoyment bodies are specifically manifested for ground-level bodhisattvas. Why would they manifest different types of bodies? Therefore, treatises clarifying the mutual inclusion of three bodies and five dharmas say that Buddha bodies manifested by equality wisdom are included in other-enjoyment, while various body characteristics manifested by activity-perfecting wisdom following different types are included in transformation bodies.

Answer: If other-enjoyment manifests child forms, how would this differ from transformation bodies following different types of bodies? Accordingly, in the Most Excellent King Sutra, regarding the second Buddha body: "disciples have one intention, therefore one characteristic is manifested; therefore one is explained." The same commentary says "only Buddha characteristics are manifested, without distinctions of the six destinies." If this is so, the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha-śāstra says "manifesting young child characteristics." Additionally, the Buddhabhūmi-śāstra says other-enjoyment bodies "manifest various forms and explain various dharmas." If one characteristic is manifested, how could it be called

various bodies? How should this be understood?

I say: The bodhisattvas transformed by other-enjoyment bodies realize the principle of equality, therefore they are called "one intention." Since disciples have one intention, transforming bodies are only Buddha bodies. For one ground, there is absolutely no size or superiority/inferiority differences. Therefore it states that one characteristic is manifested. The Most Excellent commentary's judgment that "manifesting one characteristic means only manifesting Buddha characteristics without distinctions of the six destinies" is precisely this meaning. However, regarding manifesting gods, dragons, eight classes of beings, etc. in the eighteen perfect pure lands: generally, other-enjoyment bodies are for bodies on the platform, directly facing ten-ground bodhisattvas, causing them to receive the joy of Mahāyāna Dharma. Therefore those bodies are limited to Buddha bodies. To adorn pure lands, these other-enjoyment bodies specifically manifest gods, dragons, eight classes of beings, etc. Although those gods, dragons, etc. are manifested by other-enjoyment, they are included in transformation bodies and are not called other-enjoyment bodies. Here, bodies of correct constant continuity are Buddha bodies manifested by equality wisdom. Those bodies also incidentally manifest non-Buddha forms. The Three Bodies Chapter's Zhou Commentary deeply maintains this understanding.

Further inquiry: Manifesting bodies of gods, etc. being transformation bodies accords with the text "various body characteristics manifested following types are included in transformation bodies," but manifesting them for ten-ground bodhisattvas contradicts the text "for bodhisattva assemblies not yet having ascended to grounds, śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and ordinary beings." How should this be understood?

Resolution: Ten-ground bodhisattvas also relate to transformation lands. This is because higher levels know lower ones. Therefore they also relate to transformation bodies. What fault is there in manifesting them for ten-ground bodhisattvas?
There is also another interpretation, like rolled objects.

Question: Are the transforming Buddhas of the four good roots positions other-enjoyment or transformation? If included in transformation, Master Zizhou elsewhere judges transforming Buddhas of the four good roots as other-enjoyment bodies. Thus we know they are not transformation bodies. If this is so, other-enjoyment bodies depend on equality-nature wisdom to manifest subtle material bodies, complete with eighty-four thousand characteristics and excellences, residing in pure lands. However, those in four good roots positions have not forgotten the karmic causes of mixed defilement, and pure causal conditions have not matured. The transforming Buddha bodies accordingly reside in defiled lands. The characteristics are only thirty-two, the minor marks merely eighty kinds. Accordingly, various sutras like the Buddhabhūmi and Ghanavyūha, and various treatises like the Yogācāra-bhūmi and Vijñānavāda, all consider pre-ground transformative activities as transformation bodies. Only upon first ascending to ground levels do they see other-enjoyment. Thus both sides are unclear. How should this be understood?

I say: Buddhas seen by the four good roots are not bodies seen by the three vehicles together. Accordingly, in the Most Excellent King Sutra, "response bodies that are not transformation bodies are pre-ground bodies." We clearly know that the transformative activities of the four good roots are other-enjoyment bodies. However, other-enjoyment bodies have two types: first, bodies seen by the four good roots; second, bodies manifested for ground levels. Possessing eighty-four thousand characteristics and excellences refers to other-enjoyment bodies that are transformative activities for ground levels. Transforming Buddhas for the four good roots only possess thirty-two characteristics and eighty minor marks. However, regarding what sutras and treatises explain, Master Zizhou himself reconciles this, saying: "Calling them transformation bodies for pre-ground levels explains bodies seen by the three vehicles together, not those seen by four good roots bodhisattvas."

Question: The sutra text says "this is Tathāgata-nature, this is Tathāgata-garbha." In the commentary's explanation of this Tathāgata-garbha, it quotes

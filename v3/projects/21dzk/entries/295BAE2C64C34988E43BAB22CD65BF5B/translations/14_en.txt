Question: The sūtra text explains the characteristics of the Manifest Ground bodhisattva: "seven-jewel flower pools, eight-merit water overflowing." Do four-colored lotus flowers grow together in these flower pools? Proceeding to say: The commentary states "four flowers grow together." Regarding this, according to the master commentator's explanation, when examining the present text of the sūtra, it states "seven-jewel flower pools... utpala flowers, kumuda flowers, puṇḍarīka flowers, adorning everywhere," mentioning only three-colored flowers. The same-source different-translation sūtra texts are also the same. Here, four stepped paths appear beside the flower pools representing the four noble truths contemplation, and three-colored flowers appear in the wisdom water showing the three wisdom characteristics (emptiness of person, emptiness of dharmas, emptiness of both). Why does it contradict the sūtra text by saying four flowers grow together? According to other masters' understanding, three-colored flowers appear to represent the three wisdom characteristics. How should this be understood?

Privately speaking: Since three colors are already mentioned, why exclude the padma flower? Even if representing three wisdoms, what reason is there to exclude it? Therefore, while there may be positive indication, there is no negative indication. Other masters' explanations seem without basis. Generally, when lotus flowers grow and adorn flower pools, if there are four flowers present, the adornment is complete. The explanation of having four flowers most accords with the sūtra's original meaning. Here, the old eight-volume sūtra volume seven states: "In those pools grow various flowers: utpala flowers, padma flowers, kumuda flowers, puṇḍarīka flowers." This should be taken as evidence. Also, the chapter on celestial beings and yakṣas' protection states: "Plant padma and puṇḍarīka, blue and white lotus flowers fill the pools everywhere."

According to one consideration, this should also be taken as evidence. However, regarding the representation of mentioning four-colored lotus flowers: when sixth-ground bodhisattvas contemplate dependent origination, the twelve-link dependent origination is divided into four types: projecting factors, projected factors, actualizing factors, and actualized factors. This is what is represented. Also, an old inquiry states: Contemplating the four noble truths belongs to the fifth ground. Why would four stepped paths represent contemplating the four noble truths? The response states: The commentary explains this passage: "Namely dharma-类 wisdom, depending on contemplating the four noble truths, awakening to the principle of dependent origination, there are four stepped paths." Although there is this explanation, doubts remain unresolved. To form one characteristic: depending on the contemplative practice of the previous ground, the wisdom of the subsequent ground arises. Therefore, in the previous fifth ground, depending on the wisdom that contemplates the four noble truths, the wisdom of the subsequent ground that contemplates dependent origination arises. This represents mentioning the projecting to reveal the projected. Here, the commentary is seen to explain: "Depending on contemplating the four noble truths, awakening to dependent origination. The four noble truths are the foundation."

Question: In this volume, explaining the characteristics of obstacles severed at the third ground: "not obtained now obtained, attachment ignorance." What dharma does "not obtained now obtained" refer to? Proceeding to say: The commentary states "refers to uncontaminated superior concentration." Regarding this: "not obtained now obtained, attachment ignorance" is an obstacle severed at the third ground entry mind. The dharma that is the object of attachment should definitely be dharmas obtained at the previous two grounds. Why speak of superior concentration obtained at the current ground? For example, regarding the dharma attached to by the fourth ground's "attachment to meditative attainments, joyful ignorance," it speaks of superior concentration of the previous three grounds. If forcibly taking the current ground's superior concentration as what the current ground's obstacles are attached to, wouldn't obstacles and antidotes arise in the same place, making it difficult to distinguish third and fourth ground obstacles?

Privately speaking: While the objection has some merit, examining the obstructed dharma and the obstructing entity, the commentary's explanation is most reasonable. The present sūtra text's "not obtained now obtained" means the uncontaminated superior concentration obtained at the third ground was not obtained at the second ground but is now obtained at the third ground. The substance of "now obtained" should most appropriately be the superior concentration obtained at the third ground. "Attachment ignorance" is desire-greed delusion. Greed bound to the desire realm creates attachment to the five desire objects, giving rise to distraction, thus remotely obstructing superior concentration. What is proximately attached to are the five desire realms. The obstructed superior concentration and the attached-to five desire objects are in different categories. "Attachment to meditative attainments" is precisely meditative-attainment-love delusion. Being attached to the superior concentration obtained at the third ground obstructs the bodhi-factors obtained at the fourth ground, preventing their attainment. Loving and appropriating the inferior concentration obtained at the third ground prevents attainment of superior concentration included in bodhi-factors. Therefore, the object of attachment is concentration obtained at the third ground. The obstructed dharma is bodhi-factors obtained at the fourth ground. If so, the obstructing dharma, the object of attachment, and the obstructed concentration are vastly different. How could obstacles and antidotes arise in the same place, confusing the obstacles of the third and fourth grounds?

Question: In this volume's commentary, the five types of vows of bodhisattvas are not clarified. First, should there be birth-receiving vows in both good and evil destinies? There are problems on both sides. If it extends to evil destinies, when bodhisattvas enter seeing, they attain non-birth in evil destinies. Why would there be vows for evil destiny birth? According to this, the Yogācāra Treatise (Volume 45) clarifies birth-receiving vows: "vowing to be born in good destinies." If it is like this, since co-arising afflictions are retained with the meaning of vow-assisted birth reception, why would evil destiny birth reception be prevented? According to this, in the great and small vehicle teachings, bodhi-

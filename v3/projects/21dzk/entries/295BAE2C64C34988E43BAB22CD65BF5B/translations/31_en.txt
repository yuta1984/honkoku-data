Most Victorious Questions and Answers Extract Volume 8

Question: The sūtra text says "Brahmā multitudes, various immortals, wonderful eloquence." Are the Brahmā multitudes and various immortals the same essence?

Proceeding to say: The commentary says "Brahmā multitudes are immortals" as the correct explanation. Regarding this: Brahmā multitudes are heavenly beings of the form realm, retinue of Brahmā lord. The various immortals are humans who maintain mantras and take medicines. Or they are sages equipped with the five supernatural powers possessing divine abilities. Why say "Brahmā multitudes are immortals"? The later explanation treating them as separate accords with the sūtra text, judging the initial explanation superior. There must be deep intent. How is this?

In my view: Examining the sūtra text before and after, the types that possess wonderful eloquence all raise one essence. Within one phrase there is no bringing forth of different types. It says "Four Great Heavenly Kings' wonderful eloquence" and states "Supratiṣṭhita deva-son's wonderful eloquence." The Four Great are precisely the Heavenly Kings; Supratiṣṭhita is precisely the deva-son. All other types likewise have no two types within one phrase. Therefore Cien explored the sūtra's meaning and judged the explanation "Brahmā multitudes are immortals" superior. However, regarding the name "immortal," the commentary explains this matter: "because of離欲 separation from desire." Although they are Brahmā heaven multitudes, by the meaning of separation from desire, the name immortal is established. Moreover, the one and half verses of "reverence to buddhas' wonderful eloquence etc." are sage categories: Brahmā multitudes and various immortals are form realm heavenly beings, Great Heaven Uma are desire realm heavenly beings, down to kings of the ten directions are human types. The sūtra text's sequence is thus. If saying "various immortals" sometimes refers to humans, sometimes to sages, how would the sūtra text's sequence not be confused? Cien's interpretation contains deep intent.

Raising difficulty again: That one phrase does not raise separate categories should not be so. It says "four approaches four fruits wonderful eloquence" - are the four approaches precisely the four fruits?

Answering: This difficulty is quite reasonable. However, within these sage categories, three-vehicle sages are brought forth. "Pratyekabuddha sages' wonderful eloquence" raises the pratyekabuddha multitude. "Four approaches four fruits wonderful eloquence" refers to the śrāvaka multitude. Although approaches and fruits differ, they are the same śrāvaka multitude. Making approaches belong to fruits, it is called one category. Also there are twenty-five verses bringing forth many categories like sage multitudes, but completely not raising immortal sages. Therefore it is clear that in the above text, the name immortal is established for form realm heavenly beings.

Still objecting: The commentary analyzes the above six verses: "The first verse and half concerns sages' eloquence; the remainder concerns heavens and immortal sages' eloquence." That explanation clearly sees heavenly multitudes and immortal sages as separate categories. How is this?

Answering: Since there are already two explanations, that would be the later explanation's intent. Or "other heavens" refers to desire realm heavens; "immortal sages" refers to form realm Brahmā multitudes.

Also saying: The Benevolent Kings Sūtra says "Again there are eight hundred [ten thousand billion] great immortal pratyekabuddhas." This sūtra's tenth volume states "great immortal bodhisattvas cannot be measured." Are all immortals precisely bodhisattvas and pratyekabuddhas, not separate categories?

Question: The sūtra text clarifies the Great Auspicious Goddess propagating the teaching. What stage bodhisattva's manifestation is this goddess? Proceeding to say: The commentary says "first stage bodhisattva." Regarding this: Examining this goddess, she benefits immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of beings with gold, silver and other treasures, and her practices and vows are already spontaneous.

How is she not a manifestation of eighth stage and above? Moreover, internally equipped with various virtues and externally bestowing supreme blessings, she thereby attains the designation "Great Auspicious." Judging her stage position according to her name, she should most certainly be a third incalculable eon bodhisattva. Although the pāramitā practices extend through three incalculable eons, establishing the name "great pāramitās" is exclusively limited to eighth stage and above. Should giving and others be equally analogous? Here the Silla master says "Immovable Stage bodhisattva." How is this?

In my view: Truly as the doubt and difficulty state, her virtue is high and she should most certainly be an eighth stage and above bodhisattva. In the Ornament Treatise, among the four types brought forth regarding "great," the first "surpassingly great" is "because of emerging from the three realms and five destinies." Emerging from the three realms and five destinies means emerging from the segmented and receiving a transformed body. Definitively receiving a transformed body occurs from the eighth stage onward. Establishing the name "great" for auspiciousness should most certainly be an eighth stage and above bodhisattva. Additionally, examining certain sūtra explanations, for superior faculties she manifests Great Eloquence Goddess form, for medium faculties she manifests Great Auspicious Goddess form, for inferior faculties she manifests Merit Goddess body. This text sees the three goddesses as one essence. Since Eloquence Goddess is determined as ninth stage, determining her as ninth stage bodhisattva would be most reasonable. However, regarding the present commentary's explanation, it cites Paramārtha Tripiṭaka's meaning. Why must one necessarily follow this?

Question: Are Great Auspicious Goddess and Merit Goddess the same essence with different names, or how is it? There are problems both ways. If the same essence, Teaching Master Śākyamuni explained to Avalokiteśvara the different names like auspicious celebration, auspicious fortune, etc., but completely did not bring forth Merit Goddess's name. If the same essence, why not raise her name? Here

in certain sūtras listing heavenly beings' names, Auspicious and Merit goddesses are each separately raised. We know they are separate essences. If following this, the new translation ten-volume sūtra calls it "Great Auspicious Goddess Chapter," while the old translation eight-volume sūtra titles it "Merit Goddess Chapter." Although the chapter titles differ, the benefits explained are already the same. We know they are the same essence. Following this, in the present commentary it says "Auspicious Goddess is Merit Goddess." How is this?

In my view: That goddess and this goddess are the same essence with different names. The explanations of both new and old sūtra versions, together with Cien's interpretation, are clear. Also the Dragon Tiger King Bodhisattva Sūtra sees the three goddesses as one essence. However, regarding the Twelve Name Titles Sūtra's explanation: originally manifesting three goddess bodies for three grades of faculties, the twelve name titles are explained for medium-grade faculties. Why would it explain the Merit Goddess name manifested for inferior faculties? The Eloquence Goddess manifested for superior-grade faculties is not explained because the faculty vessels differ. Moreover, even if one essence, when manifesting three goddess bodies for first and second grade faculties, why not list them separately? In the teachings there are many explanations of different essences with same names. Merit Goddess's name should have the meaning of extending to different essences. Therefore bringing forth that explanation should not constitute a difficulty.

Question: The sūtra text says "reverence, reverence to all buddhas." How does the commentary master explain this? Proceeding to say: The commentary explains "Because of revering the Three Jewels, because of seeking linguistic completeness, the word 'reverence' is repeatedly explained." Regarding this: Following Cien's interpretation and examining the sūtra's present text, it says "reverence, reverence to all buddhas," only raising the Buddha jewel. Why say "revering the Three Jewels"? Moreover, even if revering the Three Jewels, what reason is there for repeating the word reverence? The next reason also should not be so. Depending on seeking linguistic completeness to repeat

...to benefit [sentient beings]. If following this, in the present commentary, when describing the principle of multiple buddhas appearing simultaneously, it states "Based on sambhogakāya lands and responsive conjunctions, they are said to be simultaneous." This explanation is without dispute, and the principle of simultaneous appearance can be seen. How should this be understood?

One person's interpretation states: In the Three Bodies Chapter, second-ground bodhisattvas see buddhas on thousand-petal platforms and buddhas on ten-hundred-petal platforms. Third-ground bodhisattvas see buddhas on ten-thousand-petal platforms and buddhas on hundred-thousand-petal platforms. This is because the higher includes the lower, so it describes seeing the teaching buddhas of lower stages. Explaining this meaning, the present commentary speaks of multiple sambhogakāya buddhas appearing simultaneously. This interpretation is correct. However, considering this: the taught bodhisattvas see only one teaching buddha body, yet now they already see multiple teaching buddhas of lower stages. Because the buddhas seen are many, this becomes multiple buddhas appearing simultaneously. Also saying: the bodhisattvas taught by sambhogakāya understand the principle of dependent nature being like illusion, so the lands they inhabit are illusion-like lands. Therefore, the Land of Peace and Nourishment exists within the Sahā world. Śākyamuni's reward-buddha land is Amitābha's pure land. One country and one world is simultaneously multiple lands and multiple reward-buddha lands. Based on this principle, reward-buddha lands have the principle of multiple buddhas appearing simultaneously. Regarding transformation bodies, because those being taught do not understand illusion-like nature, this principle does not exist.

Question: The sūtra text states "circular light extends one fathom illuminating the boundless." How does the commentary master explain the reason for the Buddha's constant light extending one fathom? Proceeding to say: The commentary states "Out of compassion for sentient beings, constant light extends one fathom" (paraphrase). Regarding this: if it were for benefiting sentient beings, the Buddha's constant light should reach the ten-direction worlds. Those who encounter the light necessarily leave suffering and attain happiness. If so, the work of benefiting beings becomes narrow. Is there not some doubt about this explanation?

【Lower section】
In my view: The commentary master's explanation quotes from the Mahāprajñāpāramitā text. Examining that text correctly: "Being able to show compassion for all sentient beings, he restrains his light to constantly illuminate, each direction one fathom." Though with concentrated intention he could illuminate boundless worlds, to benefit sentient beings present and near, he restrains his light to one fathom. The Buddha's skillful means of benefiting beings extends from near to far. Depending on the thickness or thinness of karmic connections, sometimes illuminating boundless worlds, but constantly one fathom. This most reasonably has its principle.

The Ascending to Tuṣita Commentary states: "Body light naturally can illuminate the three-thousand great-thousand worlds, with nothing not pervaded. When applying concentrated intention, it can universally illuminate immeasurable, boundless, incomparable worlds. However, out of compassion for sentient beings, he restrains his light to constantly illuminate, each direction one fathom. If body light were extended freely, then the light of sun, moon, etc., would all constantly not appear. All types of sentient beings would not be able to know the numbers of day and night, half-months, months, seasons, etc. Some of their activities would not be accomplished."

Question: The sūtra text clarifies the prediction of buddhahood for five hundred million bhikṣus: "After thirty-three asaṃkhyeya kalpas will attain buddhahood." How does the commentary master explain this? Proceeding to say: The commentary states "Quoting the Liang Abhidharmasamuccaya, it explains that each of the ten grounds experiences three incalculable kalpas." Regarding this: our school's founders have criticized the Liang Abhidharmasamuccaya's thirty-three asaṃkhyeya kalpas in various ways. Namely, the Yogācāra Compendium states "Though this text exists, it cannot be relied upon, not knowing what accumulates to form the countless number." The Lotus Commentary states:

【Upper section】
"Examining the present Abhidharmasamuccaya and other sūtra-treatises, we have never seen the number thirty-three; we fear this was determined by local worthies using their own judgment." Having already been subjected to criticisms of violating reason and teaching, how can the present sūtra's explanation be the same as the Liang Abhidharmasamuccaya? There is doubt about this explanation. How should this be understood?

The Buddha Mother Commentary states: Now examining the Liang Abhidharmasamuccaya's meaning, thirty-three refers to using great, medium, and small kalpas as the number. Therefore that treatise says "thirty-three incalculable periods have no difference in length from three incalculable periods." Regarding great, medium, and small, the Xuánzàn states "the source of explanation arises from here." However, regarding this text, there are faults violating teaching and reason. Violating reason: the Yogācāra Compendium states "Though this text exists, it cannot be relied upon. We do not know what accumulates to form the countless number." Violating teaching: the Commentary criticizes "Examining the present Abhidharmasamuccaya and other sūtra-treatises, we have never seen the number thirty-three." However, regarding the Supreme King Sūtra's explanation: provisionally following the intention of other Hīnayāna schools, it establishes thirty-three incalculable kalpas. If following Mahāyāna true meaning, this principle should absolutely not exist. Therefore the text below states "Hīnayāna variant schools have thirty-three asaṃkhyeya." Consequently, the present sūtra's explanation follows the Hīnayāna teaching.

Also, at Bodai-in, during a certain lecture, it was said: The Supreme Commentary, Root Commentary, and other explanations differ from the Abhidharmasamuccaya's meaning. According to the Root Commentary's intention, taking three great asaṃkhyeya as the foundation, thirty-three asaṃkhyeya are established above this. However, looking at that treatise, it speaks of three asaṃkhyeya, seven asaṃkhyeya, thirty-three asaṃkhyeya, establishing them outside the three great asaṃkhyeya, not using them.

In my view: Following this interpretation's meaning, examining it carefully, the present sūtra's intention is that among the three asaṃkhyeya, their number contains thirty-three. Therefore it is called thirty-three asaṃkhyeya. It does not properly name the three minds of entering, dwelling, and exiting as three asaṃkhyeya. Saṃkhyeya means "countless." The three minds of entering, dwelling, and exiting are naturally countless kalpas, but their number is few. How can they be called countless kalpas? However, because the three minds of entering, dwelling, and exiting are included within asaṃkhyeya kalpas, following the foundation, asaṃkhyeya kalpas are established thereby. Therefore it differs from the Abhidharmasamuccaya's explanation. However, the present commentary and others explaining based on that teaching: generally the numbers are the same, establishing three kalpas based on dwelling and exiting, because the doctrinal momentum is similar, they are cited together and accepted. They are not entirely identical.

Question: The sūtra text mentions "Sahā world lord Great Brahmā King." Is this the first dhyāna king or the fourth dhyāna king? There are problems on both sides. If it is the first dhyāna king: the one tri-thousand realm is called the Sahā world, but the first dhyāna is merely the king of one four-continent realm. How can it be called the Sahā world lord? According to this, in the Lotus Sūtra it mentions "Sahā world lord Brahmā King." That text is already referring to the fourth dhyāna king. Following this example, should it be so? If following this as the fourth dhyāna king: in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra it mentions "Endurance realm lord Topknot Brahmā King." Looking at the Pure Sūtra's explanation, clarifying the various heavens gathering to this realm: "Topknot Brahmā King as the leader, from the originally worry-free four great continent realms." In that sūtra's commentary, it judges "The first dhyāna's vessel-world equals one four-continent realm, therefore called four great continent realms." Comparing the two sūtras' explanations, saying the Sahā world lord is the Topknot first dhyāna king is unclear in various ways. How should this be understood?

In my view: Regarding the Sahā world lord and Śikhin Great Brahmā, the various sūtras' explanations are not the same. Some call it the first dhyāna lord, some describe it as the fourth dhyāna king. Therefore these two names now, some call first dhyāna, some call fourth dhyāna.

"immeasurable," displaying the meaning of pervading the dharma realm, saying "like space," expressing the intent of being beyond verbal expression, saying "immeasurable." Is it truly clear that this refers to true principle? Saying "radiating light" and "like flame and illusion" is correctly explaining the arising function of reward and transformation [bodies]. According to this, the ancient eight-volume sutra states "Buddha body dharma body is like empty space." If so, the later explanation would be the correct explanation.

Question: In the commentary of this sutra, when clarifying the standards of true dharma, it quotes the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra (Volume 48) saying "revering the true dharma." Then is this reverence here the meaning of non-disparagement? How should this be understood? Considering both sides: If reverence is precisely the meaning of non-disparagement, when correctly examining the text of the Bhūmi section, it clarifies leaving behind contemptuous defilements through four characteristics, presenting "the four kinds of characteristics: revering the true dharma, revering the teacher, not disparaging the true dharma, not disparaging the teacher." Since these are already listed separately, we can know they are not one meaning. If following this understanding, reverence is the meaning of sincere respect. How could it not be the meaning of non-disparagement? According to this, in the Xuanzan commentary, when explaining the title of the Non-Disparagement Bodhisattva, it determines that "non-disparagement is the meaning of reverence."

In my view: Regarding reverence, there must necessarily be the meaning of non-disparagement. Regarding non-disparagement, there is not necessarily the meaning of reverence. That is, reverence means arising pure faith and respecting it, so at this time there is necessarily the meaning of non-disparagement. Non-disparagement means that even without arising deep faith, one does not reach the point of contempt. When arising deep faith and having non-disparagement, that is precisely the meaning of reverence. The Non-Disparagement Bodhisattva saw that the four assemblies possessed Buddha-nature and revered them. Therefore non-disparagement is precisely reverence. If so, the Yogācāra's separate listing follows this meaning.

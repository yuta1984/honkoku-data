should explain one total retention. Namely, dharma, mantra, meaning, and patience should be analyzed and explained in sequence. This most accords with the meaning and principle of the sutra text. Moreover, in the first half-verse, the principle of birthlessness patience total retention is not further seen. The explanation is not clear. How is this?

In my view: "The World-Honored One protects and is mindful, explaining the teaching" refers to dharma total retention. "Following their spiritual capacities, causing them to practice meditation" refers to mantra total retention. Having verification in divine mantras, arousing divine powers and such matters depends on the power of meditation and supernatural abilities. Next, this text should also explain patience total retention. Patience has the meaning of acceptance and approval. This should be the meaning of meditation. "Causing them to practice meditation" means causing them to practice meditation. Therefore three sentences explain the three total retentions. Next, "skillfully contemplating those sentence meanings" refers to meaning total retention. This purpose is clearly evident. "Further cultivating according to emptiness" means understanding meaning and principle. This is said to be according to emptiness. Therefore using two sentences to analyze and match the three total retentions has no further problems.

Asking again: Using the four total retentions to analyze and explain the four sentences is skillful. Now the explanation is still not clear. How is this?

Question: Why is mindfulness-wisdom called "location"? It continues: The commentary states it is called "location" because it depends on sound-location. Regarding this, among the five sense-objects, within the first form sense-object, there are distinctions of manifest and shape, etc. Therefore in form-color there should be locations, etc. If so, sound, smell, etc. have no differences of manifest and shape, etc. Why is it said to have location?

The commentary states: If speaking about the mutual form of the two truths, it generally penetrates negation and affirmation. Like initially being "non-location," according to ultimate meaning, negating location, depending on non-location. "Non-non-location" refers to: within conventional truth, because the dharma-body held by the total retention body depends on sound, and the total retention's own-nature is mindfulness-wisdom, mindfulness-wisdom is not location. Because it depends on location. The rest can be known by analogy.

In my view: This matter is mistaken. The commentary's intention is: when ultimate and conventional are contrasted and location versus non-location of total retention is discussed, there are negation and affirmation. When negating, location is negated and non-location is affirmed. If discussing according to conventional truth, the held dharma within the total retention body depends on sound sense-objects. Because sound sense-objects are not location, their essence is not location. The total retention's own-nature body of mindfulness-wisdom - its essence is not location. Also because it conditions manifest and shape form sense-objects, it is location from the object. It does not say that mindfulness-wisdom is location because it depends on sound. Is this not doctrinal discussion?

Question: Naming this chapter the "Wish-fulfilling Jewel Chapter" - is this because Buddha and the various assemblies together depend on explaining the meaning of the wish-fulfilling jewel dhāraṇī? Or how is it? There are two sides. If Buddha and the assembly together depend on explaining the wish-fulfilling jewel dhāraṇī, when examining the sutra text, Buddha the World-Honored One and Avalokiteśvara explain the wish-fulfilling jewel dhāraṇī. The other attendants - Vajrapāṇi and other assembly members - explain various separate divine mantras like the Invincible dhāraṇī, etc. They do not further explain the wish-fulfilling jewel dhāraṇī. Why do Buddha and assembly together depend on explaining this wish-fulfilling divine mantra to establish this name? If depending on this being so, the chapter's purpose states: "This divine jewel protects, causing separation from suffering and difficulties, and what is sought becomes as desired." It is clearly

known. How is it that Buddha and assembly together explain this mantra?

The commentary states: Explaining the third difficulty. Question: The divine mantra explained by Vajrapāṇi is called "Invincible." The other explanations are also separate. Why is it only called the "Wish-fulfilling Jewel Chapter"? Answer: There are two explanations. First: The chapter name follows the beginning. It cannot be fully differentiated. Second: The first two obtain the general name. The others follow their particular designations. According to reality, they generally obtain the name "wish-fulfilling jewel."

Question: "Homage, homage to the World-Honored One" - what does this reveal?

Question: Should Sarasvatī manifesting as "cowherd joy" be considered external virtue? It continues: The commentary's intention sees it as internal virtue. Regarding this, internal virtue refers to virtues like the four eloquences. Manifesting various forms and types should most be external virtue. Examining by example, looking at the text above, manifesting as Yama's elder sister, or manifesting as Vasu the great deva's sister - these are all external virtues. Why should manifesting as the joy maiden be called internal virtue?

In my view: Truly, manifesting various forms and types should most be external virtue, like manifesting as Yama's elder sister, etc. However, the present commentary explanation does not call manifesting as the joy maiden internal virtue. Generally examining the sutra text: "Observing among all sentient beings, the devi is supremely tranquil with none surpassing. Skillfully manifesting as cowherd joy maiden, when fighting with devas she always achieves victory." "The devi is supreme with none surpassing" praises great wisdom, saying "supreme with none surpassing." Using this wisdom is called internal virtue. Here in the commentary, explaining the text "At military formation places, fighting always victorious. Nurturing and subduing the mind of compassion and patience, manifesting as Yama's elder sister," it calls this "the virtue of victorious battle and subduing enemies." Explaining the text "Observing among all sentient beings, the devi is supreme with none surpassing. Skillfully manifesting as cowherd joy maiden," it describes praising the virtue of great wisdom and supreme excellence. Since it speaks of praising great wisdom, that intention is clear. It does not call manifesting as cowherd joy maiden internal virtue. Therefore there is no problem.

Question: Regarding the chapter title, when Sanskrit says "maṇi," how should it be translated and explained? (Like the ninth volume commentary)

Question: In the Unstained Dhāraṇī Chapter, regarding the total retention essence, Śāriputra's doubts are established, presenting seven kinds of distinctions like "non-location" and "non-non-location." Then should the principle-essence that abandons designations and discusses essence explain the two approaches of negation and affirmation? It continues: In the commentary there is an explanation of the two approaches of negation and dependence. Regarding this, conditioned own-characteristics are shallow and near. They are still not within reach of verbal expressions. Unconditioned true principle is deep and distant. Why would there be designations and expressions of location, etc.? Moreover, where our school has (Lamp 4), describing the matter of establishing the three times regarding perfect nature, some explain "depending on designations to reveal attainment, the three times are explained," some determine "if according to dependent conditions, provisionally established." Here it is known that when abandoning designations to discuss essence, the distinctions of three times should not be established. Moreover, examining the marginal text of the present commentary: "If speaking about discriminated and ultimate meanings, the seven sentences are generally negated." The meaning of the explanation is clear. In the true ultimate approach, there is only negation, not affirmation. If so, the present commentary explanation that generally takes negation and affirmation seems to create self-contradiction. How is this?

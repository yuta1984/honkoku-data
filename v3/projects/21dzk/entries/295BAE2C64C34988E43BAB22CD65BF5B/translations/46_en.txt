This is the principle-nature. Following that, this clarifies principle. The text "paying homage, constantly seeking correct dharma wisdom" etc. clearly explains the characteristics of wisdom categories. How does it include principle?

Question: The sūtra text states "the Tathāgata's wisdom ocean is without limit," etc. Then among the three virtues of wisdom, elimination, and compassion, which is this? Proceeding to say: The commentary states "it is the dharma body's virtue of elimination," etc. Regarding this: Generally, the virtue of compassion is the transformation body, the virtue of wisdom is the enjoyment body, and the virtue of elimination is the dharma body. However, since the present text already states "Tathāgata's wisdom ocean," it must be the reward body's virtue of wisdom. Next, the above text states "the Tathāgata's virtue ocean is profound and vast," etc. Should this be the dharma body's virtue of elimination? How is this?

In my opinion, stating "the Tathāgata's wisdom ocean is without limit" appears to pervade the true principle of the dharma realm. Saying "immeasurable by all humans and gods" reveals the principle that transcends the path of language. Therefore, explaining it as the dharma body's virtue of elimination most accords with the sūtra text. Next, regarding "the Tathāgata's virtue ocean is profound and vast," since it already states below "constantly arising great compassionate mind toward beings," this appears not to be principle. How can it be called dharma body? In the sūtra text "all humans and gods cannot measure together," the character "together" was anciently read as "tomo." It means that humans and gods cannot measure it.

Question: In the present volume's sūtra, ten lines of verse beginning with "Buddha's body is subtle, true golden color" etc. are presented. Then regarding the three bodies' merits, how does the commentary master assign and explain them? Proceeding to say: The commentary explains this matter: the first eight verses praise the transformation body, the next verse praises the reward body, and the latter verse praises the dharma body. Regarding this: Following Cīzhou's explanations and examining the beginning and end of the verses, "Buddha's body is subtle, true golden color" etc., three and a half lines of verse exclusively praise the transformation body Buddha. "Wisdom clear and bright like a great ocean" etc. should praise the reward body.

How can the text of eight verses be limited to praising the transformation body? Here, like the text "the Tathāgata's virtue ocean is profound and vast," it should be said to praise the reward body. The textual appearance is unchanged - how can differences be distinguished? Next, in these ten lines of praise, what is clarified does not reach the dharma body. How can the latter verse be said to praise the dharma body? For example, that wonderful banner bodhisattva's words of praise are limited to the reward and transformation bodies. Then the explanation seems not to accord with the sūtra text. How is this?

In my opinion, the commentary master's explanation accords with the sūtra text. The establishment of the three bodies proceeds from shallow to deep, which is the constant nature-characteristics of doctrinal aspects. Here, "Buddha's body is subtle, true golden color" etc. represents the initial transformation body characteristics. The verse "Tathāgata's virtue ocean" etc. praises the reward body. The verse "Tathāgata's wisdom ocean is without limit" etc. praises the dharma body. The sequence from shallow to deep is clear. However, regarding "wisdom clear and bright" etc., since the transformation body is manifested by the wisdom of accomplishing activities, there should be wisdom within the body. How could it not be called "wisdom clear and bright"? The text "Tathāgata's virtue ocean is profound and vast" etc. is not the same as the transformation body's shallow manifestation. How can they be equated? Next, that the text "Tathāgata's wisdom ocean is without limit" clarifies the dharma body is as previously established.

Question: The sūtra text states "seeking supreme ultimate nirvana... through the power of concentration and wisdom perfecting cultivation," etc. Then regarding bodhi and nirvana, how are they assigned and explained? Proceeding to say: The commentary explains this matter: within this, it first clarifies nirvana, and from "through the power of concentration and wisdom" below, it clarifies bodhi. Regarding this: Following the commentary master's explanation and examining the sūtra text's sequence, "seeking the supreme... cutting off various dust and burdens" etc. clarifies the bodhisattva's aspiration for bodhi and nirvana. "Through concentration and wisdom power... subtle dharma

body" raises the meaning of Śākyamuni's realization of principle and wisdom. How can these two sections be separately assigned to nirvana and bodhi? If the two sections of text are nirvana and bodhi in sequence, then during aspiration would bodhi be excluded, and on the day of attainment would nirvana be lacking? Moreover, the explanation "permanently separating from the bondages of birth and death" is judged to clarify bodhi. Taking the text "cutting off various dust and burdens" as an example, this should most appropriately be bodhi's characteristics. Then the explanation seems to contradict the sūtra text. How is this?

In my opinion, assigning nirvana and bodhi in sequence, the commentary master's explanation has this meaning appearing in the sūtra text. In the characteristics of aspiration, saying "seeking supreme ultimate nirvana" clearly raises nirvana. "Permanently separating from anxiety and suffering... cutting off various dust and burdens" clarifies what nirvana accomplishes, because depending on realizing nirvana, these meanings exist. Next, presenting the meaning of attainment, it says "accomplishing all wisdom," attributing wisdom to the dharma body. The sūtra text mutually presents one aspect and implicitly reveals the other aspect. If both were presented, the sūtra text would become redundant, so they mutually abbreviate. However, making wisdom the dharma body is because the body is manifested depending on wisdom. It is not the self-nature body. Next, regarding the text "permanently separating from the bondages of birth and death," originally being free from various bondages is the capacity of correct wisdom. This does not obstruct it.

Question: In the sūtra clarifying Buddha's merits, it states "free from improper deportment, advancing and stopping without error," etc. How does the commentary master explain this? Proceeding to say: In the commentary it "praises permanently cutting off habitual tendencies," etc. Regarding this: "Free from improper deportment" refers to the eighteen distinctive qualities, presenting "bodily actions following wisdom" etc. How can it be called "permanently cutting off habitual tendencies"? Moreover, in the Yogācāra treatise, clarifying this permanent cutting off of habitual tendencies, it judges "however, this is the six sense organs, included in the permanent cutting off of realized afflictions" and reveals unconditioned merits. Following Master Puyang, it explains "realized unconditioned." If so, how does being far removed from the improprieties of the four deportments get explained as "permanently cutting off habitual tendencies"? How is this?

Someone says: By cutting off habitual tendencies, deportment is corrected and advancing and stopping are without error. Therefore it is called "free from improper deportment, advancing and stopping without error." It properly takes cessation through selection (analytical cessation) as its essence.

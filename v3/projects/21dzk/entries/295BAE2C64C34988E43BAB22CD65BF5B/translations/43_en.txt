Question: Regarding the order of chapters in the present sūtra, first, should the Chapter on Abandoning the Body listed in this fascicle be explained after the Chapter of Praise? Answer: It is explained before the Chapter of Praise. Regarding this: Śākyamuni's praise takes place at the ceremony on Vulture Peak at Rājagṛha. The place where abandoning the body is explained is at the assembly hall of Pañcāla Forest. Central India and Northern India are separated by borders, reaching far from the southern country. If the Chapter on Abandoning the Body were explained before the praise, there should be a ceremony of returning to Vulture Peak from the Pañcāla Forest assembly hall. However, examining the text of the Chapter on Abandoning the Body, while it explains that the Buddha leads the Vulture Peak assembly and travels far to Pañcāla Forest, there is no text explaining the aspect of returning. Here we know that after [the story of] Flowing Water, remaining at Vulture Peak, the Chapter of Praise is explained. Formerly, at the site of the Bamboo Grove, visiting Pañcāla village, the past events of Prince Sattva were explained, and the Chapter of Entrustment was also explained. Based on this, examining the explanations of scholarly masters, after the Chapter of Praise, the Chapter on Abandoning the Body is explained. The two chapters of Flowing Water and Abandoning the Body have similar compassionate vows of helping living beings, so the translators arranged them consecutively as a unit, not according to the order of explanation. This explanation accords with principle and should be considered the true meaning. How is this?

Someone says: Examining this fascicle and seeing the order of chapters, since the Chapter on Abandoning the Body comes before the Chapter of Praise, the order of chapters in the palm-leaf manuscripts is probably like this. Why force an interpretation and place it afterward? However, regarding the absence of words about returning: going to Pañcāla village is the beginning place, so this is clearly explained. Vulture Peak is the original place, so actually returning there is not separately called "returning." Therefore, among the thirty-one chapters, the one chapter on abandoning the body is explained at Pañcāla Forest. The remaining chapters are explained at Vulture Peak.

Question: In the commentary of this fascicle, regarding clarifying that the Tathāgata's characteristics and marks are adorned through one hundred thoughts, among the citations of variant explanations from the Abhidharmavibhāṣā, why does the commentary master criticize the doctrine that each good karmic path generates five grades of good thoughts—lower, middle, upper, superior, and supremely superior? Answer: If there are distinctions of lower, middle, upper, etc., there would be the problem of superior and inferior characteristics and marks. Regarding this: If the five grades of good thoughts adorn the separate fruits of characteristics and marks, the actually produced characteristics and marks should have distinctions of superior and inferior. However, it is judged that the five grades of good thoughts equally adorn all characteristics and secondary marks. How can it be said they produce superior and inferior fruits? Moreover, in the Mahāyāna understanding, adorning through one hundred thoughts means that among the ten good karmic paths, each having ten types, distinctions of partial, multiple, and complete portions emerge. If criticizing the Abhidharmavibhāṣā explanation as suggested, the Mahāyāna's established doctrine would have the fault of completeness and incompleteness in the Buddha fruit. Then the commentary master's criticism is not clear. How is this?

My opinion: Here it says that through the five grades of good thoughts, this is called the adornment of one hundred merits, and when speaking of adorning the merits of characteristics and secondary marks, since the essence and function are already distinct in the five grades, the produced fruits should have differences. Namely, the fruit of the thousand-spoke wheel mark should have superior and inferior distinctions according to the five distinct grades of causes. However, regarding the Mahāyāna's establishment having this problem: first, regarding Mahāyāna doctrine, there are already two interpretations. Which interpretation does this criticism target? If criticizing according to the first interpretation and not according to the second interpretation, then this discussion is useless, because the true meaning of Mahāyāna should be considered the first interpretation. Even if understanding that this is criticized according to the second interpretation, there should not necessarily be fault. The Hīnayāna says that causes being distinct in five grades produce the thousand-spoke wheel, clearly not saying that the five grades together produce it. Therefore, the produced thousand-spoke wheel mark should have the problem of superior and inferior distinctions according to causes.

The Mahāyāna mind says that causes of few, many, etc. are distinct, but both together produce it, so counter-criticism should not arise. Regarding the adornment of one hundred merits: the ten good karmic paths are what adorns, and the merits of characteristics and marks are what is adorned.

There is an explanation in Xuanzan fascicle ten that should be consulted.

Question: In the sūtra of this fascicle, it states "white like pearl snow, kumuda flowers," etc. Then, is this kumuda flower yellow in substance, or how? From both perspectives: If it is yellow, since it already states "white like pearl snow," how can it be called yellow? Based on this, Master Cizhou explained it as white lotus. If following this interpretation, the master elsewhere judged it as yellow lotus. Both aspects are unclear. How is this?

Someone says: The Sanskrit original for white lotus is properly puṇḍarīka flower, as in ordinary usage. However, saying kumuda flower is white means that white extends to yellow and extends to red. That is, light shades of yellow and red extend to white. Therefore, the present commentary calls it white, the first fascicle commentary describes it as yellow, and the Vimalakīrti Sūtra commentary judges it as red.

Another interpretation says: In the customs of the Five Indias, calling Sanskrit words varies by location. Just like maṇi (wish-fulfilling gem), properly kumuda flower is Sanskrit for yellow, but in some places it is called by the Sanskrit for white, and in some places it is called by the Sanskrit for red.

Another interpretation says: Though kumuda flower is properly Sanskrit for yellow, ancient masters called it by the Sanskrit for white. The commentary of this fascicle perhaps explained it following the old version. This interpretation appears in the first fascicle commentary.

Question: The sūtra text mentions the praise of the Bodhi tree spirit: "Homage to the wisdom able to separate from non-dharma, homage to the wisdom constantly without discrimination," etc. Then, how is this assigned to the two wisdoms of fundamental and subsequently-attained? Proceeding to say: The commentary judges "the first line is fundamental wisdom, the next line is subsequently-attained wisdom." Regarding this: That non-discriminating wisdom is fundamental wisdom is the ordinary usage of sacred teachings. Explaining "non-discriminating wisdom" should specifically relate to direct wisdom. Describing "wisdom able to separate from non-dharma" should definitely be subsequently-attained wisdom. Isn't calling non-discriminating [wisdom] subsequently-attained wisdom contrary to interpretation? Moreover, following the order of shallow to deep is also a discussion of the general and complete. Like in the Chapter of Praise by Bodhisattvas of the Ten Directions, listing transformation, enjoyment, and dharma bodies, the explanation should not be thus. How is this?

Someone says: "Homage to wisdom constantly seeking true dharma" is uncontested preparatory wisdom. Therefore, the next two lines are fundamental and subsequently-attained wisdom in order. Listing preparatory, fundamental, and subsequently-attained is also common discourse in sacred teachings. However, it's not that there is no name for non-discriminating [wisdom]. Establishing the name "non-discriminating" across the three wisdoms is ordinary usage, such as saying "preparatory non-discriminating wisdom, fundamental non-discriminating wisdom," and "subsequently-attained non-discriminating wisdom." Regarding the explanation in the Chapter of Praise by Bodhisattvas of the Ten Directions: originally there is no obstruction to having intention based on the order of shallow to deep, so there is no contradiction.

Criticizing this interpretation: Truly, regarding the three wisdoms, establishing the name "non-discriminating wisdom," though common discourse, not saying

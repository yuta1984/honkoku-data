If so, why not say "after passing immeasurable countless eons"? Therefore, Master Kō's [assertion] that "he is at the tenth dedication [stage]" is incorrect. Other masters' [assertion] that "he is at the tenth ground" is also incorrect. Partially, the commentary master's explanation is most excellent.

Asking again: Doubting that the Tathāgata's lifespan is short and brief - how could this be a deep-stage bodhisattva? Moreover, the five practices clarify the practices to be cultivated, and the Chapter on Dream-Seeing Confession and Elimination of Karmic Obstacles clarifies pre-ground practices. Shouldn't Ruciraketu definitely be a pre-ground bodhisattva? {Dream-Seeing Confession Chapter}

Explanation: This is manifesting characteristics and creating doubt. The next two chapters clarifying pre-ground practices refer to the practices of sentient beings taught by Ruciraketu. Confessing sinful obstacles and eliminating karmic obstacles are called pre-ground practices. It does not mean that Ruciraketu's practices are immediately called pre-ground practices.

Another objection: Based on the four buddhas being sambhoga-kāya, how can we say Ruciraketu is a ground-stage bodhisattva? Countless hundreds of thousands of devas, dragons, and eight kinds of beings arrived at Ruciraketu's chamber where the four buddhas were present, it is explained. It also explains that the four buddhas went to Vulture Peak. We know they are transformation buddhas. Next, using the listing of Amitāyus Buddha to prove [they are] sambhoga-kāya is also unclear. Amida Buddha possesses the three bodies. Regarding what is called Amitāyus, though we don't know, could it be that buddha's transformation body? How is this?

Explanation: That devas of desire and form realms, etc. arrive inside Ruciraketu's chamber is originally for pure land adornment; transforming devas and dragons, etc. is a constant matter. Next, regarding the four buddhas going to Vulture Peak, before the four buddhas, is Vulture Peak immediately the pure land? Next, regarding Amitāyus Buddha, when preserving only the sambhoga-buddha interpretation, the next objection is

useless.

Question: The sūtra text says "holding offerings to all the teaching bhikṣu saṅgha left by Buddha Ratnaśikhin," etc. So what among the ten offerings is the explained offering? The commentary says "It is the sixth joint offering."

Regarding this, following Zizhou's explanation and examining the beginning and end of the sūtra text: "At that time, King Sujāta, seeing precious treasures raining in these four continents, all held offerings to all the teaching bhikṣu saṅgha left by Buddha Ratnaśikhin," etc. According to the present sūtra text, only King Sujāta alone established this offering. This should most definitely be called the fifth self-made offering. Why call it joint offering? Moreover, examining the explanation in the Yogācāra Bodhisattva Stage, it lists ten offerings, naming the sixth as "teaching-others offering." It completely does not call it "joint offering." If so, doesn't the present explanation contradict the fundamental treatise's teaching? How is this?

My view: Fully examining the commentary text: "Following the practices of cultivation, there are ten. This is only one type, namely the first offering. Offerings have ten. This is the sixth, joint offering," etc. The meaning is: "That there are ten practices of cultivation dharma" refers to the ten offerings explained in the Bodhisattva Stage. "'This is only one type, namely the first offering,' etc." means that what is explained in the present sūtra text is the seventh, wealth-reverence offering among Yogācāra's ten offerings. Among the ten types of this wealth-reverence offering, what this sūtra lists is the sixth joint offering within that treatise's wealth-reverence offerings. It does not generally mean the sixth joint offering among the ten offerings. The sixth offering among the ten offerings is teaching-transformation offering, not wealth offering. The commentary's purport is like this. Why mistakenly say it explains the sixth among the ten offerings? However, among the ten types of wealth-reverence offering,

regarding naming the sixth as "joint offering": the other nine wealth offerings sometimes raise food and drink, etc., but the seven treasures are not complete and do not appear. The sixth among the wealth offerings listed in the present Yogācāra raises all the seven treasures like gold and silver, etc., therefore it is called "joint offering." It is not the joint offering of self-made and teaching-others, etc.

Yogācāra 44 says: "How do bodhisattvas make offerings to the Tathāgata at what places? Know that offerings briefly have ten types: 1) śarīra offerings, 2) caitya offerings, 3) present offerings, 4) non-present offerings, 5) self-made offerings, 6) teaching-others offerings, 7) wealth-reverence offerings, 8) vast offerings, 9) untainted offerings, 10) right-practice offerings. ○ If bodhisattvas, at places of the Tathāgata or at caitya places, with various clothing, food and drink, bedding, medical supplies for illness, personal necessities, respectfully inquiring and bowing, welcoming with joined palms, various incense, powdered incense, applied incense, flower garlands, music, banners and canopies, flags and lamps, songs and praise, five-limb prostration, circumambulation rightward, making offerings; or again offering inexhaustible wealth-offerings; or again offering maṇi, pearls, beryl, conch shells, jade discs, coral, musāragalva, agate, amber, gold and silver, red pearls turning rightward, such treasures; or again offering maṇi rings and bracelets, jeweled insignia, etc., various ornamental implements, up to offering various treasure bells in circumambulation, or scattering rare treasures, or wrapping with jeweled threads, making offerings. This is called bodhisattvas' wealth-reverence offerings at places of the Tathāgata or at caitya places," etc. The ten types of wealth-donation offerings in the present Yogācāra treatise are not clearly divided, so although difficult to divide, temporarily dividing them,

we say: clothing and food, etc. as one type; bedding, etc. as one type; powdered incense, etc. as one; music, etc. as one; inexhaustible wealth as one; gold and silver, etc. as one; rings and bracelets, etc. as one; treasure bells, etc. as one; scattering rare treasures as one; jeweled threads as one.

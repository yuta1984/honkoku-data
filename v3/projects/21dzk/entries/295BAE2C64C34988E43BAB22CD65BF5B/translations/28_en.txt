In my view: If one examines this superficially, the doubts and criticisms seem reasonable. However, when carefully examining the commentary text, there are no contradictions between the preceding and following explanations. Regarding the seven meanings of location, etc., when the true and conventional truths are mutually formed, the principle of thusness penetrates both negation and affirmation approaches. That is, negating location is called "non-location," and it is also "non-dharma-location." This is the time of the non-identity approach when true and conventional are contrasted. If according to the non-difference approach, true and conventional have an aspect of oneness. Therefore, negating "non-location" and also expressing "non-non-location." In the aspect that does not differ from the conventional, this has the meaning of location. The sutra text explains the aspect of negation and does not reveal the aspect of affirmation. Cien reveals this, establishing the explanation in terms of the two approaches of non-identity and non-difference. Here in the commentary's later text, "According to ultimate meaning, negating location and expressing non-location" explains the two approaches of negation and affirmation of the non-identity approach. In the commentary above, "non-non-location transcends emptiness" means: in the time of the non-difference approach, phenomena have location therefore are not empty. Because true principle does not separate from that, having location is not empty. This negates being "non-location" and reveals that there is also the affirmation of the aspect of "non-non-location." Here in the commentary, "If speaking about ultimate meanings, the seven sentences are generally negated" explains the aspect of negation of the two approaches of non-identity and non-difference, and next "generally taking negation and affirmation" explains the two meanings of negation and affirmation of the two approaches.

Question: In the sutra of this volume, explaining the supreme benefits of hearing the dharma, it states "increasing lifespan in the present." Should this increased life-faculty be established in newly perfumed seeds of the present? Or how is it? There are two sides.
If not establishing it: When depending on the contributory perfuming of reciting and hearing dharma, awaiting the power of supreme meditation and supreme vows, and increasing one's lifetime, why would present new seeds not serve as the basis of the life-faculty? If

newly perfumed seeds of the present have no power to extend life, why say "in the present"? Moreover, where our school has (Secret volume 1), presenting the basis of life-faculty, "sometimes depending only on the new." Depending only on new seeds - is this not the time of extending life? If depending on this to establish it: In the Consciousness-Only treatise: "However, depending on new birth. These consciousness seeds, drawn by karma, have functional differences, with determined duration, provisionally establishing life-faculty." The explained meaning clearly shows that presently perfumed name-and-form seeds are not the basis of life-faculty. How is this?

In my view: The treatise's "However, depending on new birth. These consciousness seeds, drawn by karma, have functional differences, with determined duration, provisionally establishing life-faculty" means that karma-drawn name-and-form seeds generate the eighth consciousness, and life-faculty is established in making the duration determined. Extending lifespan means extending the determined duration of the eighth consciousness. This is entirely seeds drawn by previous karma. Presently perfumed name-and-form seeds do not become karma-drawn and have no power to determine duration and extend it. Why establish life-faculty depending on this? However, regarding Dharmapāla's explanation "sometimes depending only on the new," this speaks of establishing life-faculty regarding newly perfumed seeds, not saying "presently perfumed new seeds." These are newly perfumed seeds perfumed in previous lives. Moreover, that explanation's analysis is not uniform and should not be confusedly criticized. Asking again: Even if previous life's karma serves as what draws and determines duration but does not extend it, if presently perfumed newly perfumed seeds are drawn by the supreme good karma of hearing dharma, generate the eighth consciousness, and determine duration, why not establish life-faculty depending on this

?

Answering: Regarding name-and-form seeds of the eighth consciousness perfumed in this world, there are two meanings as to whether they generate the eighth consciousness in the perfuming world or not. If depending on the meaning of not generating, this criticism is useless. If depending on the meaning of generating, there is no contradiction. That is, name-and-form seeds drawn by previous karma have superior power, therefore they determine the eighth consciousness's duration. Due to the power of name-and-form seeds perfumed in this world, although there is barely the power of generation, there is no power to determine duration.

Question: In this volume's sutra text, "Vajrapāṇi Guhyapati Bodhisattva explains divine mantras." Is this bodhisattva a transformed form of Avalokiteśvara? Or how is it? If not a transformed form of Avalokiteśvara: examining the sutra text's beginning and end, investigating Vajrapāṇi's original ground, Avalokiteśvara and the secret traces each separately explain divine mantras. That they are not one essence in different forms is clear in the sutra text. Moreover, examining other volume explanations, it says "one buddha among the thousand buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa." If depending on this being so, in the Lotus Profound Praise it determines "Vajrapāṇi is a transformed form of Avalokiteśvara." What other volume sutras and commentaries describe accords with this. How is this?

In my view: The Vajrapāṇi Guhyapati Bodhisattva explained in this sutra should not be a transformed form of Avalokiteśvara. Since Avalokiteśvara already explained divine mantras, this bodhisattva also explains them. If they are one essence, why would provisional and real both repeatedly explain? Particularly, this Vajrapāṇi Guhyapati Bodhisattva should not be Vajrapāṇi. Because the bodhisattva name is established. How could bodhisattva and bodhisattva be one essence? However, regarding the sameness or difference of Avalokiteśvara and Vajrapāṇi: Avalokiteśvara's transformation manifestation as Vajrapāṇi is explained in the Lotus Sutra, and the Profound

【Lower section】
Praise explanation is this. There are also vajra spirits not manifested by Avalokiteśvara. The Secret Traces Vajra Warrior Sutra explanation is this. Like those Brahmā kings and Indra bodies, etc., sometimes there are Avalokiteśvara's transformative manifestations, sometimes there are those not manifested by Avalokiteśvara. Why make the explanations of various sutras contradictory? Also saying: This sutra's Vajrapāṇi Guhyapati Bodhisattva is not a spirit. Only a bodhisattva holding vajra in hand, protecting Buddha-dharma, therefore establishing this name.

Question: In this sutra, regarding clarifying the meaning of total retention essence, what does the commentary master explain about the retained essence of the attainable birthlessness patience total retention? It continues: "Retained and retainer both have mindfulness-wisdom as essence." Regarding this: the retainer is already mindfulness-wisdom - why is the retained's essence the same? If both use mindfulness-wisdom as essence, what distinction can be made between retainer and retained? Depending on this, in the Yogācāra Bhūmi (45), presenting the retained mantra essence: "In what Buddha explained, attaining bodhisattva patience's various mantra verses and sentences." Various mantra verses and sentences clearly means presenting retained dharmas. How is this?

In my view: If discussing the reality, the retainer essence should be mindfulness-wisdom. However, saying the retained is mindfulness-wisdom: the commentary's next above states "the retained is the cause of patience. Patience is wisdom. Depending on divine mantra power, wisdom's discrimination arises. Also depending on mindfulness-wisdom power, divine mantras are attained," seeing mindfulness-wisdom as cause. Therefore depending on cause-and-effect meaning, regarding the retained, its essence is called mindfulness-wisdom. It does not directly call the retained essence mindfulness-wisdom. The Yogācāra text should not create contradiction.

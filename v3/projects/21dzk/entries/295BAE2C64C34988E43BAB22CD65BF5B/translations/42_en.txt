Question: In the present commentary, regarding clarifying the adornment of the Tathāgata's characteristics and marks through one hundred thoughts, among the citations of variant explanations from the Abhidharmavibhāṣā, why is the doctrine that each good karmic path generates five grades of good thoughts—lower, middle, upper, excellent, and supremely excellent—criticized?

Saishō Mondōshō Fascicle Ten

Fascicle Ten
Question: In the commentary of this fascicle, regarding clarifying the doctrine that bodhisattvas transcend the number of eons of cultivation through inconceivable excellent practices, first, the meaning of transcending eons from the eighth ground onward—does it permit wisdom-predominant types to transcend compassion-predominant ones, or do compassion-predominant persons transcend wisdom-predominant ones? From both perspectives: If wisdom-predominant are the transcenders, then examining the eighth ground and above, self-benefit practices are spontaneous and effortless, so the two types of wisdom and compassion should not have superior and inferior distinctions. In the gate of benefiting others, compassion-predominant is superior and wisdom-predominant bodhisattvas are inferior. When discussing transcending eons based on diligence and laziness in cultivation, shouldn't compassion-predominant definitely be the transcenders? Therefore, examining the present commentary's explanation, it explains that there is transcending of eons in the gate of benefiting others. The interpretive principles of wise scholars of both Tang China and Japan are like this. If following this, compassion-predominant are the transcenders, but looking at Master Zizhou's explanation, the commentary of the upper fascicle states "Comparing wisdom to compassion, the predominant one explains transcendence," and in the Yideng it states "How much more so for wisdom-predominant transcending compassion-predominant." Clearly knowing that wisdom-predominant are the transcenders. How is this?

My opinion: The present commentary together with the Yideng's explanation has clear textual appearance. Wisdom-predominant should be made the transcenders. Generally, the speed of attaining bodhi depends entirely on the bodhisattva's inclination. Wisdom-predominant quickly aspire to attain bodhi. Compassion-predominant are slow and delayed. Here we know that wisdom-predominant prioritize self-benefit, and self-benefit cultivation of the six perfections, etc., is quickly fulfilled. Compassion-predominant specialize in benefiting others, practicing merit and virtue of benefiting others such as the four means of attraction, etc., therefore they do not advance to buddha-

hood. The principle that wisdom-predominant are able transcenders is clear. However, regarding the present commentary's explanation, this explanation is most difficult to reconcile. Tentatively reconciling it: Generally, the present commentary's intention is that regarding self-benefit practices, the eighth ground and above is the place of doubled advancement, so wisdom-predominant and compassion-predominant should not have distinctions. Regarding other-benefit practices, whatever type enters the samādhi of extinction of person-emptiness has only the meaning of increased function, not increased essence, so even if compassion-predominant, in self-type comparison, if there are types that enter the samādhi of extinction of person-emptiness, when compared to types that do not enter, their other-benefit practices can be inferior. Why necessarily compare compassion-predominant to wisdom-predominant and understand that compassion-predominant's other-benefit practices are superior? The explanation "comparing wisdom to compassion, the predominant one explains transcendence"—that wisdom-predominant are the transcenders—is an interpretation that cannot be moved in the slightest. The explanation "how much more so for wisdom-predominant," etc., is also the same as this. Why forcefully read punctuation marks? Since the explanations should be uniform, the present commentary's analysis is like this.

Also saying: From the eighth ground onward, regarding wisdom and compassion-predominant entering or not entering extinction samādhi, this should be a matter for discussion.

Also, Bodhisattva Tokuichi explained that wisdom-predominant have much fundamental wisdom, compassion-predominant have much subsequently-attained [wisdom]. Using elimination of delusions and realization of principle as the limit of continuation of wholesome mind, if fundamental wisdom is abundant, wisdom-predominant should advance quickly to buddhahood. If advancing quickly, wisdom-predominant should be able transcenders. Isn't the original intention of transcending eons to advance quickly to buddhahood rather than not practicing? Therefore, Tokuichi's explanation is the meaning of wisdom-predominant as able transcenders. Transcending eons on the grounds is a difficult doctrine in every matter. It should not be easily established.

If there were no cloud-ground support, on what basis would this be distinguished? Here we know that even in the fourth dhyāna, there must definitely be cloud-ground support. However, regarding the name "cloudless," the present commentary explains that although there is cloud-ground, because that heaven's karmic reward is superior, it does not attach to clouds, therefore it is called "cloudless." Saying "dwelling apart from clouds" means this. If there were absolutely no cloud-ground, it should simply say "there is no cloud-ground." Saying "departing from clouds" conversely indicates that cloud-ground exists.

Raising further difficulty: Even if there were no cloud-ground, why would there be no distinction between heavenly abodes? In the formless realm there is no cloud-ground, yet it speaks of "space-infinity base, etc." and mentions dwelling places. Also, based on this, various places should be established. How should this be understood? Reconciling: The formless realm, having no physical form, though lacking cloud-ground, has distinctions based on superior and inferior births. The form realm differs from that - if there were no cloud-ground, how could this be distinguished?

Someone (this is the meaning of the Comprehensive Commentary) says: Though there may be no coarse cloud-ground, there should be subtle cloud-ground. Naming it "departing from clouds" is probably based on this meaning. According to the Dharma Garden Pearl Grove commentary, the formless realm establishes this name based on the absence of coarse physical forms, but it explains there are subtle physical forms. This can be taken as an example. Also, though the formless realm has no location, there are four types based on birth, etc. - this should be seen by consulting citations in the Sutra-Treatise Essentials.

Question: In the sutra's clarification of mutual inclusion between the dharma body and all phenomena, first, when speaking of "all phenomena," does this include the dharma body? It continues: When the sutra speaks of "all phenomena," it does not include the dharma body. Regarding this, since it already speaks of "all phenomena," why doesn't it include the dharma body? Moreover, when speaking of "the dharma bodies of phenomena," it includes all phenomena, but when speaking of "all phenomena," why doesn't it include the dharma body?

I say: Characteristics and nature are neither one nor different. If following the gate of non-difference, the dharma body and all phenomena should mutually include each other. However, regarding this sutra passage, the commentary explains: "Because the true suchness principle-essence is universally constant, therefore it includes all phenomena. The reverse of this, therefore it does not include suchness." The meaning is: when the dharma body follows the gate of non-difference, it pervades all phenomena. Since it pervades, what phenomena would it not include? Next, when speaking of "all conditioned phenomena," when following the gate of non-unity, the conditioned lacks the meaning of universal constancy. How could it include the dharma body? The repeated meaning says: The dharma body, because its essence relies on the meaning of collection and pervades phenomena, manifests the gate of non-difference, therefore it includes all phenomena. When the conditioned speaks of "all phenomena," though it manifests the gate of non-unity, it does not clarify the meaning of pervasion. Therefore these are different.

Question: The sutra text states "if one wishes to seek the three clarities and six supernatural powers of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas." If so, are there wisdom-liberated ones among group-practicing pratyekabuddhas, or how should this be understood? There are problems on both sides. If there are, examining the present sutra text, above "those who wish to seek the fruit of stream-entry, etc." refers to wisdom-liberated ones among śrāvakas who, because they do not remove meditative obstructions, do not attain fundamental concentration and lack supernatural powers possessed through concentration. Next, "if one wishes to seek the three clarities and six supernatural powers of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas" etc. presents śrāvakas who have attained the six supernatural powers. These are precisely those liberated in both ways. Pratyekabuddhas are also thus. While the sutra text's clarification regarding śrāvakas presents wisdom-liberated ones, regarding pratyekabuddhas it only mentions those liberated in both ways. We know that among group-practicing pratyekabuddhas there are no wisdom-liberated ones. Accordingly, the present commentary judges that "group-practicing pratyekas, though there are two types, both

attain dual liberation" and determines "group-practicing pratyekabuddhas are definitely liberated in both ways." If following this interpretation, the master judges elsewhere "there are such types." How should this be understood?

Question (another aspect): Among group-practicing pratyekabuddhas, could there be those who do not attain supernatural powers?

Someone says: The treatise clarifies "people who attain cessation-concentration, namely some no-more-learners or some learner-saints." Since it places the word "some," we clearly know that regarding no-more-learners, not all attain it. There are those who attain and those who do not attain. Those no-more-learners include śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. Since pratyekabuddhas already have people who do not attain cessation-concentration, these are people who do not attain the nine sequential concentrations. This type precisely does not attain supernatural powers. Supernatural powers exist in fundamental [concentrations] - how could people who do not attain the nine sequential concentrations arise them? Based on the word "some" in "namely some no-more-learners," this meaning is established. Therefore the master's commentary states: "That text uses meaning - now according to this text - therefore there are pratyekabuddhas who do not attain cessation-concentration - namely among group-practitioners - and even those who do not attain supernatural powers." Now examining this meaning: among group-practitioners there are wisdom-liberated and both-ways-liberated types. Wisdom-liberated people, relying on the not-yet-attained ground, cut off delusions and realize principles but completely do not attain fundamental concentration. The Three Wheels chapter also has this meaning. Therefore in the master's various explanations throughout, he maintains that there are wisdom-liberated ones among group-practitioners. However, regarding the sutra text and Zizhou's explanations, this discusses the majority. Actually this type should exist.

Question: In the sutra text's clarification of three-karma confession, first, can mental karma have impulse-initiating superior thought? There are problems on both sides. If not, when externally manifesting body and speech, internally activating mind - why would mental karma lack impulse-initiating superior thought? Accordingly, Master Zizhou in various places has explained

【Lower section】
that this meaning exists. If following this interpretation, the Consciousness-Only Treatise takes deliberative-decisive dual thought as mental conduct, and takes impulse-initiating superior thought as relating to bodily and verbal karma. Also, the Yogācāra Treatise names thought that does not initiate body and speech as "mental karma." In Yogācāra and Consciousness-Only understanding, mental karma appears to lack impulse-initiating superior thought. Both sides are unclear. How should this be understood?

I say: As in the doubt and difficulty, when externally manifesting body and speech, internally activating mind - mental karma should definitely have impulse-initiating superior thought. Therefore in the Lamp of Profound Meaning it states: "Now according to principle, mind can also have impulse-initiating superior thought - because it is called activating mind - because it lacks poverty, etc." Is this explanation not clear? Also, the present commentary clarifies impulse-initiating thought, saying "properly arising the three karmas" - the meaning is the same. Additionally, the commentary on the Chapter of Ten-Direction Bodhisattvas' Praise states in its explanation "what initiates body and speech is precisely mental karma" - doesn't it determine that impulse-initiating superior thought that initiates body and speech is precisely mental karma? However, regarding treatise texts, because they clarify universally for the three vehicles, they do not speak of mental karma's impulse-initiating superior thought. Next, regarding Yogācāra and Consciousness-Only explanations: impulse-initiating superior thought that initiates body and speech also activates mind, therefore it is named mental karma, but the matter involves confusion. To avoid this, thought when not initiating body and speech, having no confusion in being named mental karma, clearly presents only this. It does not prevent taking impulse-initiating superior thought that "initiates body and speech" as mental karma.

Question: In the sutra text's clarification of ten-direction bodhisattvas praising the Tathāgata with the three karmas of body, speech, and mind, first, is impulse-initiating superior thought that initiates bodily and verbal karma named mental karma, or how should this be understood? Answer: There should be

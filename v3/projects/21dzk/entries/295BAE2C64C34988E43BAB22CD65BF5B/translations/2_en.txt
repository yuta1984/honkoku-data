Regarding faith and understanding, the mind is non-retreating and becomes increasingly deep. Therefore it is merely said this way.

Question: Regarding including this sūtra in the third period, how does the commentary master explain this?
Response: The commentary states: "Because there are dharma-eye purity benefits," etc.
Concerning this, dharma-eye purity benefit is the benefit of the first fruit of Hīnayāna. Why does having this establish the meaning of the third period? Moreover, in the first two periods, this benefit is also clarified. How so?

I say: Generally, the third period is teaching for all three vehicles universally. The various vehicles obtain benefits, and what is taught is the middle way teaching of neither emptiness nor existence. That there are Mahāyāna benefits is without doubt. Because what is taught is neither emptiness nor existence, Hīnayāna benefits are produced to universally allow all vehicles to receive benefits. Because obtaining benefits is broad, to manifest that this is the third period, dharma-eye purity benefits are cited to establish this meaning. It is not said to be the third period merely because this benefit exists. However, regarding the objection about the first two periods, Master Cízhōu judges elsewhere in the Lamp: "Although there are three vehicles in the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras and each obtains benefits, because it does not clearly explain that dharma is neither empty nor existent, it belongs to the second period." The intention is that although it has benefits for the three vehicles, the doctrinal principles taught are not those of the third period. It does not explain clearly. Therefore it is still not included in the third period.

Question: Is this sūtra taught in one time and one assembly, or how?
If it is taught in one time and one assembly, then within Wonderful Banner's chamber the four Buddhas explained the purport of the Śākyamuni's long and distant lifespan, and in the Pañcavarka forest the teaching master described the events of Prince Sattva. Since the places of teaching are not limited to Eagle Peak, why call it teaching in one time and one assembly? If so, the general introduction of this sūtra only mentions dwelling in Rājagṛha city. Doesn't it omit other places? Based on this, Master Cízhōu refutes other masters' interpretations, saying "the explanation of one time and one assembly is superior," etc. Both sides are unclear. How so?

【Lower Section】
Someone says: Following the beginning text of the sūtra, it should be called teaching in one time and one assembly. However, regarding within Wonderful Banner's chamber, Master Cízhōu reconciles this saying: Wonderful Banner came to Śākyamuni's place and repeated the teaching, and the Tathāgata confirmed it, etc. Because it was taught at Eagle Peak Mountain, this cannot be used as an objection. Next, regarding Pañcavarka forest, our school has no separate reconciliation. However, reconciling this: because that place is where body-abandonment practices were performed in the past, when teaching the Body-Abandonment chapter, the characteristics of that place are shown. It is actually the summit of Eagle Peak Mountain.

Inquiring further: The explanation of the long and distant lifespan in Wonderful Banner's chamber was taught by the four Buddhas. Why say Wonderful Banner repeated it? Next, showing the characteristics of Pañcavarka forest at Eagle Peak Mountain summit—is there a visible place in the sūtra text? Also, that place exists in new translations but not in old translations. There are differences. How so?

Someone says: According to Pingbei's correct interpretation, it should be called teaching in two places and two assemblies: Eagle Peak Mountain and Pañcavarka forest. However, in the commentary, "the former explanation is superior" is said based on the old translation sūtra. Because there is no Pañcavarka forest assembly. If depending on the new translation sūtra, it should be called two places and two assemblies.

Objection: Although this interpretation seems reasonable in one way, it is not reasonable throughout. When the commentary master creates wonderful explanations for the new translation ten-volume sūtra, how could he not determine the times and assemblies of the new translation sūtra? Next, correctly examining the commentary explanation: "Now I explain: this is merely one time and one place... The bodhisattvas of the ten directions only praise this land, not going to other lands to praise those Tathāgatas," etc. The old translation calls them "Buddha Praise chapter," "Ten-Direction Bodhisattvas Praise chapter," etc.

The four praise chapters are not divided. One knows the commentary explanation was made according to the new translation. However, regarding Pañcavarka forest: generally, establishing an assembly place means the Buddha, in order to teach sūtras, goes to dwell in that place, manifests characteristics like raining flowers, emitting light, entering samādhi, etc., properly gathers assemblies of four groups, eight divisions, humans and devas, etc.—the place where dharma is taught is established as a time-assembly. However, the Buddha manifesting supernatural powers and going to create forest parks is to make known the events of body-abandonment austerities. It is not for dwelling. Therefore, when the Buddha withdraws his supernatural powers, both teacher and taught are together at Eagle Peak Mountain. Therefore one knows it is not a dwelling place.

Also saying: Explaining the text "dwelling in Rājagṛha city on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa," "dwelling means the meaning of residing and traveling to teach," etc. The intention is to reside at Eagle Peak Mountain, constantly dwelling here to teach the wonderful dharma. However, Rājagṛha city is a place of traveling to teach, not a place of constant residence. Therefore it is not taken. In our school's understanding, Vulture Peak, Pure Land, and empty space are called the three places. Even adding to that, it is not called four places. According to that thinking, although the Buddha manifests supernatural powers and goes to Pañcavarka forest, because it is not a place of residence, it is not taken and not called a time-assembly place.

Question: When Śākyamuni taught this sūtra, should he manifest auspicious signs like raining flowers and emitting light?
Arguments on both sides. If he does not manifest them: emitting light summons those with karmic connections, manifesting earthquakes startles those with mature roots. For example, when teaching the Lotus Sūtra, were there such auspicious signs? If depending on manifesting them: examining the sūtra text and investigating this sūtra, human masters do not present auspicious signs. If they existed in the Sanskrit original, why not mention them?

【Lower Section】
One knows they do not exist. How so?

The Xing Commentary volume 1 states: According to other sūtras, there should be auspicious signs to startle those with karmic connections. That they are absent now is because they are implied in abbreviation. Otherwise, the Great Sage benefits beings through many approaches. How can one uniformly criticize this? etc.

Question: The sūtra text lists fellow-hearers: "forty-nine thousand garuḍa kings, Fragrant Elephant Power King," etc. Is Fragrant Elephant Power King then a garuḍa king?
Response: In the commentary they are separate, etc.
Concerning this: "forty-nine thousand garuḍa kings" generally identifies their name, with Fragrant Elephant Power King as their leader, separately mentioning one of them. Thinking by analogy: saying "twenty-eight thousand dragon kings, Lotus Dragon King" and stating "forty-two thousand divine princes, Joy-Seeing Divine Prince"—all these Joy-Seeing Divine Prince and Lotus Dragon King are within the general identification. Why are these separate categories outside the general identification? The commentary master's explanation must have deep meaning. How so?

I say: The commentary master already provides two explanations. One explanation is like the objection. If that explanation accords with the sūtra text, it should be taken as the real meaning. The objection is quite useless. However, tentatively establishing the meaning of the explanation: outside the flying types of garuḍa assemblies and dragon king assemblies, there should definitely be ground-traveling types like Fragrant Elephant Power King and others. Therefore it is explained as a separate category. However, regarding using other sūtra texts as analogical objections: saying "forty-two thousand divine assemblies" and mentioning "thirty-six thousand yakṣa assemblies," below these are all the same type without different types. But below this current text, Fragrant Elephant Power King, gandharvas, asuras, etc.—there are many different types. Therefore it states "serving as leaders." Why must they necessarily be the same type? The commentary master obtained

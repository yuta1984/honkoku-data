Because it excludes the Buddha body and takes other characteristics, it is said thus. Or perhaps it means "the eight-phase transformation body is also this phrase." Next, regarding the explanation in the Three Bodies chapter, it is not about the Buddha body during the Buddha's lifetime. When the Buddha was alive, he also manifested different types of bodies, so why doesn't it discuss that, but only explains the doubt about speaking of different types of bodies after extinction? The meaning is that when the Buddha was alive, creating transformations was easy, so it doesn't discuss different types of bodies during his lifetime. After extinction it is difficult, so it only speaks of that. "When the principal exists, creating transformations is easy" means the principal is the Buddha. When the Buddha was alive, creating transformations was easy. Next, regarding the response body and other-enjoyment body, the meaning of this sutra seems somewhat different. The response body refers to naming the Buddha body manifested in response to transformable spiritual capacities, taking the transformative activities of the four good roots and ground levels. The other-enjoyment body specifically takes the transformative activities of ground levels. The scope differs.

Question: In clarifying the characteristics of the three bodies in the sutra text, can the body seen by the three vehicles be included in the response body? Both aspects. If it includes it, then including the Buddha seen by the three vehicles in the transformation body is a complete establishment common to all teachings. Why would it be included in the response body? Looking correctly at the sutra text, the response body refers to pre-ground bodies. The body seen by the three vehicles is not limited to ground levels but extends to śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and ordinary beings. We clearly know that in the sutra's meaning, the response body is narrowly limited to the transformative activities of the thirty minds, not broadly those seen by the three vehicles. Accordingly, this commentary explains it as being included in the transformation body. If this is so, the great master elsewhere judges it as being included in the response body. How should this be understood?

I say: The meaning of this sutra, when simply listing the three bodies, is the same as the explanations of other teachings. In the transformation body, it includes all bodies of the five destinies

and bodies seen by the three vehicles. In the response body, it specifically takes the transformative activities of the four good roots, mentioning the first to reveal the transformative activities of the later ten grounds. Thus in the commentary, explaining the text "manifesting various bodies, this is called the transformation body," it says "namely the eight phases, etc.," revealing that it takes bodies seen by the three vehicles. Explaining the response body sutra, "all Tathāgatas for bodhisattvas" etc., what manifests only for bodhisattvas is explained as the transformative activities of the four good roots and the ten grounds. This is the same as other teachings, establishing the three bodies. Next, at the time of distinguishing the four phrases, entering one level deeper into the detailed classification, dividing it into four: the transformation body takes only bodies of the five destinies, not taking Buddha forms. The response body takes the transformative activities of the four good roots and the ten grounds. Bodies seen by the three vehicles are taken in the phrase "both response and transformation." This means that among the three bodies, Buddha bodies of the transformation body are taken in the combined phrase, while non-Buddha bodies of the five destinies are taken in the single phrase. While other teachings don't explain the detailed classification, this sutra goes one level deeper, revealing that this is an explanation of the meaning of detailed distinctions. If so, then the chapter master's explanation that bodies seen by the three vehicles are response bodies explains this sutra's four-phrase distinction method. Here the chapter, naming the bodies manifested for pre-ground, three vehicles, and ten-ground bodhisattvas as response bodies, combines and explains the phrases "response body but not transformation" and "transformation body which is also response body." To explain in detail, manifesting Buddha bodies for the three vehicles is taken in the combined phrase, while manifesting for pre-ground four good roots and manifesting bodies for the ten grounds should be said to be taken only in the response-but-not-transformation phrase. Therefore, the explanations of Cien and Zizhou do not contradict each other.

The above discussion of "manifesting various bodies, this is called the transformation body" should be answered with this meaning. It is a difficult discussion.

Question: Can the other-enjoyment body that transforms bodhisattvas with segmented bodies before the seventh ground be included in the phrase "only response, not transformation"? Response: In the commentary it says "it is both response and transformation phrase." Regarding this, the other-enjoyment body is the transformative activity of ground levels and should be the phrase "only response, not transformation." Why, like the transformative activities of pre-ground levels, is it called the phrase "both response and transformation"? For example, the transformative activities of the eighth ground and above are the phrase "only response, not transformation." Moreover, aren't the transformative activities of the four good roots called the phrase "only response, not transformation"?

I say: The present explanation is very difficult to reconcile. To reconcile it temporarily, the commentary's meaning is that taking the Buddha body of enlightenment under the tree seen by the three vehicles, this is both transformation body and response body. This is the fundamental meaning. Therefore, next below, saying "the transformative activities of segmented bodies before the seventh ground are also this phrase" is, outside the fundamental meaning, incidentally using reasoning to establish that they should also be included in this phrase. It states "also included in this phrase, the reasoning also does not contradict." This seems to be the meaning. Actually, they should be included in the phrase "response body but not transformation body." However, the meaning of calling that body the phrase "both response and transformation" is found in the Amitābha Sūtra Commentary, where it says "in the Buddha land of reward, bodhisattvas with transformed bodies are born; in the pure land of transformation Buddhas, bodhisattvas with segmented bodies are born." The meaning of this explanation seems to be that bodhisattvas with segmented bodies before the seventh ground are not born in the pure land of the reward Buddha. While there are two interpretations, bodhisattvas with segmented bodies should be said not to be born in other-enjoyment lands. However, this commentary saying that the other-enjoyment body is the transformative activity of segmented-body bodhisattvas

【Lower section】
means that while the actual bodies of segmented-body bodhisattvas exist in the desire and form realms, so they have no birth-meaning in other-enjoyment lands, they go there to hear the Dharma teaching of other-enjoyment. If so, are the segmented-body bodhisattvas in other-enjoyment lands transformations and not real? Bodhisattvas with transformed bodies are the proper objects of transformation in that land and are real bodies. They should be the fundamental purpose of the reward Buddha's transformative activities. In that aspect, both transforming and transformed should be real. Here, in the aspect of segmented bodies, both transforming and transformed should be called transformations. Since the transforming one is specifically the Buddha body, it is called response body and also called transformation body. The meaning of the explanation is difficult to know. Perhaps it should be reconciled like this temporarily.

Question: In the sutra text's explanation of the establishment of the three bodies, can it be said that the other-enjoyment body spans kalpas between previous and subsequent Buddhas? Both aspects. If it spans many kalpas, since the spiritual capacities of those to be transformed continue, why would the transforming Tathāgata be interrupted? Moreover, wouldn't the transformative activities belonging to one Buddha continue? If forcibly interrupted, wouldn't it contradict being called "continuous permanence"? If it doesn't span kalpas, the Avalokiteśvara Prediction Sutra and Mahāyāna sutras say "After Amitābha Buddha enters parinirvāṇa, the true Dharma remains in the world equal to the Buddha's lifespan." The sutra text clearly shows spanning kalpas after entering extinction. How should this be understood?

I say: The non-interrupting permanence of the other-enjoyment body appears in the Adorning Buddha Land explanation. Therefore, discussing one Buddha in reality, there is no interruption. However, when a first-ground bodhisattva reaches the second ground, the other-enjoyment body that transforms first-ground beings does not destroy its body but gradually becomes greater. Here the first-ground bodhisattva still sees the originally seen extent. The second-ground bodhisattva sees the gradually enlarged body. Also seeing what the first ground saw

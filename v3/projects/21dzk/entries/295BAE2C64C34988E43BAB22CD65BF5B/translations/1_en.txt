For this reason, those who attain realization through gradual stages should be limited to the first fruit. Those who transcend to obtain once-returner or non-returner do not establish the first fruit. Therefore it extends to later stages.

Someone objects: This interpretation cites the Yogācāra Treatise as proof. However, that treatise refers to cutting off view-delusions and cultivation-delusions. If this is correct, then cultivation-delusions would have no benefit.

Someone else objects: In the current commentary, when Master Cízhōu explains worldly fruit benefits and birth-cause benefits, he sometimes takes dharma-eye purity benefit as cause benefit, sometimes as fruit benefit. However, Mahāyāna fruit benefit means conferring the prediction of becoming a Buddha, and cause benefit means generating bodhicitta. Therefore fruit benefit refers to Buddhahood, and cause benefit should broadly refer to positions before becoming Buddha. Why call dharma-eye purity benefit the first fruit?

In reconciliation: Indeed, the commentary's explanation is profound and its intention difficult to know. However, attempting an interpretation: if it were ordinary Mahāyāna cause and fruit benefits, fruit benefit would be Buddhahood and cause benefit would broadly refer to causal positions. But the current intention, comparing to Hīnayāna dharma-eye benefit, the fruit should be the first bhūmi, because one initially obtains the outflow-free wisdom eye. The cause is the beginning of outflow-free causes, being only the first bhūmi. When speaking of accomplishment through dharma-eye purity, it should be the first bhūmi. Here we understand that even the cause benefit of Hīnayāna dharma-eye purity is called obtaining the outflow-free wisdom eye.

Question: Regarding this sūtra's title, should the character "ming" (bright) have a Sanskrit equivalent?
Response: The commentary states: "Ming depends on linguistic convenience and has no Sanskrit equivalent." Regarding this, the sūtras explained by generations of Tripiṭaka masters all place the two characters "light-brightness." One knows there is Sanskrit. Based on this, Chinese masters

【Lower Section】
cite Sanskrit and Chinese terms. Namely, Sanskrit says "prabha," which means "light-brightness" in Chinese. {Xing Commentary} Or Sanskrit says "uttama," which means "bright" in Chinese. {Ancient transmission, Paramārtha} etc. If there is no Sanskrit for the character "ming," why forcibly add it in Chinese? Moreover, considering this as an example, when explaining the title of the Wonderful Sūtra, because the Sanskrit original lacks the character "white," it is judged not to say "Wonderful Dharma White Lotus." If the Sanskrit original lacks the character "ming," shouldn't it be explained according to that?

I say: Cízhōu gathered up omissions from Sanskrit originals and corrected errors in the original sūtra. The presence or absence of Sanskrit for the character "ming" should simply be entrusted to Huìzhǎo's profound examination. Cízhōu was Cí'ēn's foremost disciple and expertly examined Sanskrit words. The current commentary explanation states: Sanskrit says "prabhāprabha," meaning "light" in Chinese. Sanskrit says "uttama," meaning "supreme" in Chinese, etc. Since the Sanskrit "prabhāprabha" lacks the character "ming," why arbitrarily add it? However, adding the character "ming" is to include the two emptinesses, merit, wisdom, and bodhi. Therefore, using other masters' explanations, shouldn't this be questioned? Next, the difficulty regarding the Wonderful Sūtra follows what is appropriate. Why should everything be equal?

Question: According to Paramārtha's intention in dividing this sūtra's introduction, main body, and circulation into three sections, which translation does this depend on?
Arguments on both sides. If depending on new translation sūtras: according to Paramārtha's intention in judging the sūtra's three sections, the first chapter is the introduction section, the next nineteen chapters are the main doctrine section, and the latter two chapters are the circulation section, etc. According to the current sectional judgment, there are only twenty-two chapters, without thirty-one chapters. One definitely knows this judgment depends on the old translation. If this is so, examining the commentary's explanation, the sūtra has thirty-one chapters, judged according to Paramārtha and divided into three parts, etc. Already depending on the thirty-one chapter sūtra, this

【Page 5】
【Upper Section】
sectional division is judged. One knows it depends on the new translation. Additionally, the commentary's later text states: Paramārtha says: From the Lifespan chapter to the Body-Abandonment chapter, all this is the main doctrine, etc. This explanation also depends on the thirty-one chapter newly explained sūtra. It is not clear throughout, how so?

I say: The intention of this current explanation is: when judging the three sections of the new translation thirty-one chapter sūtra, if depending on Paramārtha's translated twenty-two chapter sūtra, calling the first chapter the introduction section, making the next nineteen chapters the main doctrine, and making the latter two chapters the circulation, then accordingly from the Lifespan chapter to the Body-Abandonment chapter, twenty-five chapters should be called the main doctrine. This is the intention of combining old and new sūtras to divide into three sections. If not so, the twenty-two chapter sūtra lacks the Entrustment chapter. How can the latter two chapters be called circulation?

Question: Regarding Paramārtha's intention of dividing into three sections, what are the two chapters of the circulation section?
Response: The Buddha Praise chapter and Entrustment chapter. Regarding this, depending on Cízhōu's explanation and considering Paramārtha's intention, to Dharmakṣema's translated four-volume, eighteen-chapter sūtra, four more chapters were added in translation. Namely: the Three Bodies Distinction chapter, Karma Obstacle Elimination chapter, Dhāraṇī chapter, Pure Ground chapter, and Fulfilling Vows in Dependence on Emptiness chapter. Is there completely no Entrustment chapter? If adding the Entrustment chapter, it should be twenty-three chapters. Why call it twenty-two chapters? {Should be reconciled according to the previous}

Question: Is this sūtra an exposition before the Lotus Sūtra, or how?
Arguments on both sides. If it is a pre-exposition: Bodhisattva Wonderful Banner raising doubts about the Tathāgata's short lifespan depends on the Samantabhadra Sūtra's statement "three months after the kalpa, I shall enter nirvana." One knows it is after the Lotus. Additionally, in other volumes of this sūtra: "Śāriputra, in the Mahāyāna you have already been able to set forth, have faith and understanding in the Mahāyāna, and study the Mahāyāna," etc. Stating "already been able to set forth" - doesn't this refer to the Lotus assembly? If calling it a later exposition, other volumes state: "Mahākāśyapa, the Buddha spoke of my meager wisdom among the śrāvaka assembly," etc. However, the śrāvakas turned their minds toward the great during the Lotus assembly. If after the Lotus assembly, how could this be pointed to and called "meager wisdom"?

【Lower Section】
I say: The Compilation of Decisions establishes this below and presents three pieces of evidence. First, because it clearly explains the three bodies with manifest characteristics. Second, this sūtra contains passages explaining the ālaya-vijñāna, namely explaining fundamental mind in the Three Bodies chapter. Third, because the assembled followers listed are more numerous than those, etc. The Lotus Sūtra lists fifty-two thousand and two hundred; this sūtra lists ninety-eight thousand people. The intention is that śrāvaka types should be few initially and many later. Therefore this is used as the reason for before and after. However, regarding speaking of "meager wisdom," Venerable Shànzhū (Roaming Mind Decision) reconciles this saying: Kāśyapa humbly deprecates himself, saying "meager wisdom," etc. "Meager wisdom" is self-deprecating language.

The Roaming Mind Decision objects: If after the Lotus assembly, how can it say "already been able to set forth and have faith and understanding in the Mahāyāna"? During the Lotus assembly they already set forth. Why again say "have faith and understanding in the Mahāyāna"? etc. This objection's meaning: faith and understanding is shallow, turning the mind is deep. If the Supreme [Sūtra] is later, then at the time of the Lotus, they turned their minds toward the great. How could it later say "faith and understanding" at the time of the Supreme? One knows it should be before the Lotus. The Roaming Mind Decision reconciles this difficulty saying: Faith and understanding and turning the mind are equal. However, after the Lotus

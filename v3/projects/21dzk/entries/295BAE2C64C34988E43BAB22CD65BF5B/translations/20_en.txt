regarding the eight negations." The textual form clearly appears to see that true reality transcends the eight negations. How should this be understood?

The Essentials states: "Only revering the dharma body, not the other two bodies - the Prajñāpradīpa Treatise, initial verse of reverence." The Prajñāpradīpa Treatise verse states: "Neither arising nor ceasing, neither annihilation nor permanence, neither one nor various, neither coming nor going." Yìbīn quotes this text.

In my view: The true reality of dharma-nature does not transcend the eight negations. This principle is as the objection states. However, regarding the present commentary explanation: in the present sūtra, concerning the five aggregates and dharma realm, this clarifies the point that the five aggregates are not arising-ceasing, etc. "The intention regarding the dharma realm" means the five aggregates are identical to the dharma realm and are not arising-ceasing, etc. Because the five aggregates transcend the eight negations, directly regarding the five aggregates, the eight negations are not clarified. The eight negations are clarified in identity with the dharma realm. "Transcending the eight negations" refers to the essence of the five aggregates, not pointing to the dharma realm.

Question: The sūtra text states: "At that time the Buddha addressed the Bodhi Tree Spirit, good goddess." Then is this Bodhi Tree Spirit identical to the Solid Earth Spirit, or how should it be understood? Answer: There should be two meanings of sameness and difference. Regarding this, both are unclear. If different, examining the commentary master's explanation: "The Bodhi Tree Spirit is also named Solid, also named Earth Spirit." This explanation clearly appears to see them as the same essence. According to this, in the new translation sūtra: "At that time the Buddha addressed the Bodhi Tree Spirit," while the old translation sūtra text states: "At that time the Buddha addressed the Earth Spirit Solid." Comparing the two sūtras' explanations, their essence should definitely be the same. If following this as the same, the tree spirit is named Bodhi Tree Spirit, the earth spirit is named Solid. How could their essence be the same? According to this, in both new and old sūtras,

【Lower section】
the Bodhi Tree Spirit and Solid Earth Spirit are each explained separately. Then both sides are unclear. How should this be understood?

In my view: The commentary master quotes the two meanings of various explanations without deciding right or wrong. Therefore, though this matter is difficult to determine definitively, temporarily the meaning of same essence with different names should be established. The new translation says "At that time the Buddha addressed the Bodhi Tree Spirit," the old translation states "At that time the Buddha addressed the Earth Spirit Solid." Comparing the two sūtras' explanations, they appear to be the same essence. Moreover, Master Zǐzhōu, explaining this sūtra text, says "The Bodhi Tree Spirit is named Solid Earth Spirit." Therefore the commentary master's original intention appears to consider them the same essence. However, regarding the objection that "tree spirits and earth spirits should each be separate": the Compilation of Decisions states "Tree spirits and earth spirits are one. Because they do not separate from earth, they are named earth spirits." If so, because they protect the Bodhi tree they are named Bodhi Tree Spirit, yet also having the principle of not separating from earth, they are also named earth spirits.

Also saying: Spirits belong to the ghost realm. Though heavenly names should not be established, being noble goddesses among ghost spirits, their virtue is praised by naming them heaven.

Question: The sūtra text "explains the teaching of others being like illusions." Then how does the commentary master explain the essence of illusory masters and illusory disciples? Proceeding to say: The third explanation states: "The illusory master is the Buddha, the illusory disciples are bodhisattvas." Regarding this, according to the commentary master's explanation, examining the sūtra text's development, it clarifies the teaching that dependently originated phenomena are like illusions, explaining three types of analogies: the analogy of conditions producing illusory realms, the analogy of foolish people grasping reality, and the analogy of wisdom's complete understanding. The analogy of conditions producing illusory realms is: just as depending on the conditions of illusory masters and illusory disciples, various illusory elephants etc.

【Upper section】
appear, dependently originated dharmas are also like this. The third analogy of the wise person's complete understanding explains understanding the principle of illusion. If so, buddhas and bodhisattvas are the third wise persons, the essence of the complete understanding analogy. Furthermore, shouldn't illusory masters and illusory disciples be called buddhas and bodhisattvas? According to this, many other masters say: "The illusory master is the eighth consciousness, the illusory disciples are the transformed consciousnesses." This explanation most accords with the sūtra text. How should this be understood?

In my view: The commentary's explanation of illusory masters and illusory disciples has three explanations. Among these, taking the third explanation, it says "comparing with the meaning below, this explanation is good," judging it the correct explanation. Therefore this explanation's meaning should be established. Generally, just as illusory masters and illusory disciples manifest various forms like illusory elephants, buddhas and bodhisattvas, following conventional usage, explain the names and characteristics of all dharmas, manifesting gold, silver, fish, rice, etc., causing sentient beings to generate thoughts of real existence. Therefore buddhas and bodhisattvas are named illusory masters and illusory disciples. Moreover, the sūtra's later text presents profound correct dharma, explaining dharma essence: "There are multitudes of illusory people with mind and mental factors able to understand profound correct dharma." Already naming the dharma essence that understands profound correct dharma as "illusory people." Using buddhas and bodhisattvas to be named illusory masters and illusory disciples - when the commentary states "comparing with the meaning below," is this the intention? However, regarding "the analogy of the wise person's complete understanding being buddhas and bodhisattvas": even if they are also buddhas and bodhisattvas, and illusory masters and illusory disciples are also buddhas and bodhisattvas, what fault is there? Illusory masters and illusory disciples are buddhas and bodhisattvas who explain and manifest all dharmas, manifesting fish, rice, etc. Using buddhas and bodhisattvas, they are named illusory masters and illusory disciples. Next, the analogy of the wise person's complete understanding: just as illusory masters and illusory disciples know the foundation of illusion, buddhas and bodhisattvas understand dependent origination as illusion, therefore also using buddhas and bodhisattvas, this is called the analogy of the wise person's complete understanding. Though one essence, depending on

【Lower section】
respective meanings, this is taken again.

Objecting again: Establishing "comparing with the meaning below" should not be so. The sūtra's later text "there are multitudes of illusory people" - this asks "How many sentient beings are there already who can understand such profound correct dharma?" presenting the sentient beings to be taught, therefore answering "there are multitudes of illusory people," presenting the sentient beings to be taught who understand all dharmas. By what means are they called buddhas and bodhisattvas?

Responding: "People with wisdom" and stating "these are all sages" refers to buddhas and bodhisattvas. This should be established using them. Next, "multitudes of illusory people" are truly sentient beings to be taught, but saying "illusion" applies to people, not to dharmas. Therefore illusory masters and illusory disciples should definitely apply to people. However, the first understanding's second explanation discusses illusory masters and illusory disciples in relation to the eighth consciousness aggregate and comparing fundamental consciousness with transformed consciousnesses, exclusively applying to dharmas. Therefore, if following the later text, since this explanation neither applies to people nor to dharmas, does it accord with the later text?

Question: In the initial chapter of the present volume, praising the Buddha's form body merits: "Supreme pure Muni honored one, body light illuminates bright like golden color." Then which characteristics are being praised? Proceeding to say: The commentary has two explanations. Sometimes saying: "Praising the golden skin color characteristic." Sometimes saying: "Praising the constant light characteristic." Regarding this, both explanations are unclear. Regarding the first explanation: examining the sūtra text, is praising the Buddha's body not seen at all? Moreover, the later text "World Honored One's supreme body golden color" - is this the golden skin color characteristic? Regarding the second explanation: examining the later text, praising the constant light characteristic: "Round light one fathom illuminating without boundary." If the present text praises the constant light characteristic, wouldn't this be redundant speech?

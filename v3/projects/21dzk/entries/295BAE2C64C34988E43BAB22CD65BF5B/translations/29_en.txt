Question: In the sutra text explaining the already-defiled dhāraṇī, there are four types of sentence meanings, but Śāriputra only raises the one sentence of "non-location and non-non-location." How does the commentary master explain this? Proceeding: "Śāriputra partially understands it. Buddha fully understands it, therefore raising one part for explanation." Regarding this: Venerable Śāriputra understands the essence of dhāraṇī and raises the sentence "neither existence nor emptiness." Why doesn't he become aware of the remaining sentence meanings like "non-dharma, non-non-dharma," etc.? Based on this, examining the sutra text, it first标 "as you have said" and lists seven types of sentence meanings. From this we know that Śāriputra fully understood all seven types. How is this?

In my view: The heart of the initial explanation is that by raising the first, it reveals the remaining six types of sentence meanings. This accords with the sutra text and should be the correct interpretation. However, the heart of this explanation is that although Śāriputra actually understands the seven sentence meanings, to show the difference between complete and partial understanding, he temporarily raises just one sentence.

Question: In this sutra's commentary, regarding citing contract sutra explanations to clarify the turning of mind of the four fruits, should the number of kalpas for turning of mind like twenty thousand kalpas, etc., be included in the stage of devoted practice? Or how is it? If included: those who turn their minds after eighty, sixty, forty, or twenty thousand kalpas have not yet entered asaṃkhya practices. Since their practices are not yet excellent, why say they are included in the stage of devoted practice? Based on this, in another place (Lamp 7) it says "not devoted practice, because their practices are not yet superior." If based on this they are not included, in the present commentary it says "included in devoted practice." Then both sides are unclear. How is this?

In my view: Regarding devoted practice, there should be superior and inferior levels. Because they have not yet aroused deep, firm, and great mind, they have not entered asaṃkhya. If depending on this meaning, it should be said they are not the stage of devoted practice. The ninth volume of the Lamp explains this mind. If abandoning self-regulation and self-salvation practices and depending on arousing vast altruistic practices according to this meaning, it could be named devoted practice. The present commentary has this mind. Because there are differences of far and near regarding provisions, it says "all do not enter this stage." Twenty thousand kalpas, etc., are not near provisions, therefore are not named provisions. If depending on the meaning of distant provisions, they could be named provisions. This example should be so.

Question: Regarding the sutra text "non-location, non-non-location," should there be meanings of non-location and non-non-location for each of the three natures of imagined, dependent, and perfected? There are two sides. If each of the three natures has this meaning: non-location means non-existence; non-non-location means non-emptiness. However, the imagined nature's essence is entirely without dharma and completely cannot have the meaning of non-emptiness. Dependent and perfected are dharmas with essence - why would they have the meaning of non-existence? Here examining the Madhyāntavibhāga text: "false discrimination exists, regarding these two there is complete non-existence," etc., describing how the three natures are contrasted to clarify the principle of neither empty nor existent. The Consciousness-Only treatise determines "self and dharmas are not existent, emptiness is not non-existent," completely not discussing middle way regarding one dharma. If depending on this there is none, then on the two natures of dependent and perfected there are both meanings of emptiness and existence, negating the two attachments of increase and decrease, according with the principle of middle way. If preserving one side of existence, wouldn't this arouse the mind of attachment to increase? Here in the present commentary it appears that all three natures have meanings of non-location and non-non-location.

In my view: One-dharma middle way is a dispute between our school and other schools. Our school's mind permits one-dharma middle way. Other schools' intention is that the Consciousness-characteristics school does not permit one-dharma middle way. Regarding our school's one-dharma middle way, Consciousness-characteristics scholars have different interpretations, but temporarily preserving one meaning: generally regarding middle way there are two levels.

【Lower section】
That is, middle way dependent on explanation and middle way transcending language. Middle way dependent on explanation means nature and characteristics are neither one nor different, like skin and fruit. Like that imagined and grasped, also on the dependent, false emotions grasp it as truly existent, therefore making the three natures one dharma, generally establishing middle way on the three natures. This does not mean the three natures are separate and generally establishing middle way on separate dharmas. Why do Daoquan and others say they don't permit one-dharma middle way? If so, the explanations of both the Madhyāntavibhāga and Consciousness-Only treatises are the strongest evidence for one-dharma middle way.

Asking again: When the three natures to be established are combined to establish one dharma, middle way is established. When the three natures are said to be separate, is it not established? However, in the present commentary, the three natures are separate, and regarding the one dharma of the imagined, non-location etc. are established, therefore differing from what the lecture-discussion maintains?

Answering: Our school's intention is that the three natures are neither one nor different. There is absolutely no separation from the three natures. Why would one generally establish this regarding those three natures when the three natures are separate? Therefore the present commentary's mind, even when speaking of establishing non-location etc. regarding the imagined, this is because it does not separate from dependent and perfected. Up to speaking of having this regarding the perfected, it is because it does not separate from the imagined. The commentary's mind is the same as what is maintained.

Or the present sutra's mind establishes middle way transcending language. Middle way transcending language means explaining that all dharmas are ineffable. The meaning of ineffability is because each of the three natures possesses this. The commentary's explanation immediately reveals transcending language.

Question: The sutra text explains non-defiled dhāraṇī. Among these, at what stage does one gain benefit from patience with birthlessness total retention? Proceeding: The commentary cites Yogācāra text saying "attained before the stages." Regarding this,

【Lower section】
Based on Cien's interpretation, examining the sutra text: "These are the dharmas cultivated by bodhisattvas, upheld by past bodhisattvas, this is the mother of bodhisattvas." Since it already says "dharmas cultivated by bodhisattvas," should this definitely be what stage-level bodhisattvas cultivate? Based on this, in the Profound Secrets Sutra, the third stage attains auditory retention dhāraṇī, the ninth stage attains four types of total retention. Here, does the present sutra's intention, same as the Profound Secrets Sutra, mean the four types of total retention should all be attained at stage levels? On what explanation does the interpretation of "attained before stages" depend?

In my view: Generally depending on conventional explanations, patience with birthlessness total retention should be attained at stage levels. However, the present commentary's explanation follows the intention of Yogācāra volume 45, describing patience dhāraṇī: "These bodhisattvas will soon attain pure and superior intentions, already attained depending on the superior patience of superior devoted practice stage." This text appears to clarify attainment before stages. Following the text, the commentary master determines the Yogācāra text as attained before stages, and speaking from reality, if speaking about superior-inferior and complete-incomplete, the stage of attainment is not definitely so, he reconciles. This is said depending on that text. Generally it does not mean limited to before stages.

Question: In the present sutra's commentary, regarding clarifying the four unobstructed understandings contrasted with four total retentions, the cause and effect of retainer and retained, do the third and fourth unobstructed understandings respectively serve as the retained fruits of mantras and patience with birthlessness? Or how is it? If not so: the first two unobstructed are already the two types of retained dharma and meaning. Regarding the latter two types, why are they not the fruits of mantras and patience with birthlessness? Based on this, in the Great Master's Profound Praise (volume 10), it determines "dharma, meaning, analysis, and eloquence unobstructed are respectively the fruits of four total retentions," and Master Cien in the present commentary uses retention to

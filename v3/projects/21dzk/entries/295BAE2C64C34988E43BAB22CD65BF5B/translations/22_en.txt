The text explaining future results can also include the dharma master who expounds. Why should the word "dharma master" in "praising that dharma master" be limited to the offering dharma master?

Question: The sūtra text clarifies the ten kinds of dharma master practices: "If there are those who listen and hear such sūtras... how much more so for writing, maintaining, reciting, and expounding for others." Then how does the commentary master explain this matter of initially raising the merits of listening and hearing? Proceeding to say: The commentary states: "Initially raising the inferior to compare with the superior." Regarding this, according to Cízhōu's interpretation, examining the sūtra text from beginning to end, initially "if there are those who listen to such sūtra texts," listing the many practices of maintaining etc., the textual pattern clearly uses the one type of listening and hearing to compare with the many practices of maintaining etc. Why use the inferior practice of listening and hearing to compare with the superior benefits of maintaining etc.? Moreover, in the Lotus Sūtra, it describes obtaining the merit of six sense faculties' purification through the five dharma master practices, with ear faculty merit being 1200 and body faculty merit being 800. Considering this analogy, when compared to writing practice, listening and hearing practice should be called superior. Then the commentary master's explanation is unclear. How should this be understood?

In my view: Regarding the ten dharma master practices, there should be mutual superiority and inferiority. Listening to the teachings and believing in the superior virtues of the sacred teachings leads to later practices of writing etc. If following this meaning, listening should be called superior, and the Lotus Sūtra's explanation follows this intention. Also, believing in the superior virtues of the sacred teachings and later engaging in practices like writing - the merit is great and accumulates over many days, months, and seasons. If this is the meaning, then listening should be called inferior. The present sūtra's explanation follows this intention. Therefore, is this called relative comparison of many and few?

【Lower section】
One explanation says: Using the inferior to compare with the superior means calling few inferior and many superior. That is, using the one practice of listening to compare with the many practices of writing etc. Listening is one practice, while writing etc. are numerous, so many is superior and one is inferior. Using the one practice of listening to compare with the one practice of writing, and not comparing with the one practice of practicing as taught.

Question: The sūtra text states "crossing the boundless fearsome great ocean, liberated from endless birth-death cyclic existence." Then should this birth-death be understood as referring to both karma and afflictions? Proceeding to say: The commentary makes two explanations, with limiting it to afflictions being the first explanation. Regarding this, generally this passage explains the principle of cutting off the cause and effect of suffering and accumulation. That is, the text "fearsome great ocean" cuts off the truth of suffering, and the words "liberated from birth-death" cut off the truth of accumulation - this is Master Cízhōu's own definitive judgment. Since karmic causes are already the truth of accumulation, shouldn't they be specifically included? Moreover, in explaining the title of the Chapter on Eliminating Karmic Obstacles, the reason for not titling it "delusion and suffering" is that karmic obstacles are superior compared to delusion and suffering, so they are exclusively raised as the title. If so, in the text on liberation from birth-death, even if taking superior karma and disliking inferior delusion, there cannot be a meaning of exclusively taking delusion categories and excluding karmic causes. How should this be understood?

In my view: Master Cízhōu made two explanations without determining right and wrong. I don't know if the explanation including both is the correct meaning. However, to establish the intention of the first explanation: the commentary explains this matter - due to bondage by delusion, one cycles through birth and death. Therefore, cutting off the truth of accumulation is called liberation. Karma is not the meaning of bondage nor the root of birth-death, so it's not called karma. The textual meaning is clear. If following the meaning of obstructing the noble path, karma should be called superior.

When there is extremely heavy unwholesome karma, it necessarily brings about a body in difficult circumstances with no conditions for entering the noble path. Therefore karma should be called superior. Hence the analogical objection from the Chapter on Eliminating Karmic Obstacles should not apply.

Question: The sūtra text praises the dharma master's merits: "able to sound the supreme great dharma drum." Then are the six types including dharma drum and dharma conch the Mahāyāna dharma wheel? Considering both sides: If it's the Mahāyāna dharma wheel, initially raising "turning the dharma wheel" without mentioning the two dharma wheels of illumination and maintenance, the six meanings should definitely be the Hīnayāna wheel. According to this, in the commentary, explaining the sūtra's eight passages: the first reveals the dharma wheel's essence, the middle six clarify the dharma wheel's meaning. Regarding the initial dharma wheel as essence, the sūtra speaks of "twelve-aspect four noble truths dharma wheel," appearing to be the Hīnayāna dharma wheel. Since the essence is already the Hīnayāna dharma wheel, why would the middle six meanings be the Mahāyāna dharma wheel? If following this as the Hīnayāna dharma wheel, the present sūtra specifically clarifies the profound dharma of Mahāyāna, especially presenting buddha-fruit transformation-basis and praising dharma master virtues. Why wouldn't it be the Mahāyāna dharma wheel? According to this, Chinese masters determined that the six passages of dharma drum etc. clarify the Mahāyāna dharma wheel. How should this be understood?

In my view: These six types should specifically be the Mahāyāna dharma wheel. The reasoning is like the doubt and difficulty from one side. However, regarding saying "turning the dharma wheel" without mentioning illumination and maintenance: the designation "dharma wheel" encompasses the three-period teachings, so saying "turning the dharma wheel" also clarifies illumination and maintenance. Next, regarding the dharma wheel's essence being the Hīnayāna dharma wheel because of the twelve aspects of four noble truths: observing the four noble truths is also observed by bodhisattvas. This is the observation of destructive conditions.

Therefore, although it's the twelve-aspect observation, it encompasses the bodhisattva dharma wheel. Moreover, the sūtra text describes "the twelve wonderful practices praised by all buddhas, the profound dharma wheel." Though the twelve practices may be the Hīnayāna dharma wheel, calling it the "profound dharma wheel" should specifically be the Mahāyāna dharma wheel. If that profound dharma wheel's essence is the Mahāyāna dharma wheel, then the six types of dharma wheel meanings being the Mahāyāna dharma wheel has principle without contradiction.

Question: The sūtra text states "Buddha's virtues boundless like the great ocean." Then which virtues are praised? Proceeding to say: "Praising concentration and wisdom virtues." Regarding this, following the explanation and examining the sūtra text from beginning to end: "Buddha's virtues boundless like the great ocean / Limitless wonderful treasures accumulated within / Wisdom virtue-water constantly overflowing / Hundreds of thousands of supreme concentrations all filling it." Here we know that the upper two lines praise other virtues. If so, would this text praising concentration and wisdom virtues make the sūtra text repetitive? According to this, Master Heungbeop of Silla judged this as praising the precept category. This explanation accords with the sūtra text. How should this be understood?

In my view: The commentary explains the text "Buddha's virtues boundless like the great ocean etc." as the general sentence. Knowing that "wisdom virtue-water constantly overflowing etc." is specific. General and specific are already different. What repetition is there? However, regarding "limitless wonderful treasures accumulated within," the commentary judges the ten powers, fearlessnesses etc. as wonderful dharma treasures. It praises the merits of precepts etc. together. Next, "wisdom virtue-water" - the intention of comparing above to the great ocean, concentration and wisdom functions manifest without limit. This text is like clouds containing water - wisdom contains the water of various virtues, so it's called "wisdom virtue-water." Next, concentration exists depending on wisdom, so still comparing concentration to water, it says "hundreds of thousands of supreme concentrations all filling." If so, Cízhōu's wonderful explanation accords with the sūtra

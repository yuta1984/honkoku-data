Daijaku and others. All were able to serve prominently as models and examples for their generation.

The eulogy says: Among the various disciples of Nanshan, none were not dragons and elephants. When Master Guanyin refers to Master Zhou as the legitimate heir, could it be that his practice and understanding absolutely surpassed his peers? Unfortunately, the years and generations are distant and remote, and we cannot examine the details of his practices and achievements. Nevertheless, his disciples and grand-disciples each diligently proclaimed the opportunities for transformation. From this we can recognize Master Zhou's abundant virtue.

**Tang Dynasty Master Zhiren of Guangming Temple in the Capital**
Vinaya Master Zhiren was a person from Silla. He came to observe China and entered under the teaching seat of Great Master Chengzhao. He studied the vinaya section and achieved clear understanding with enlightened comprehension. Based at Guangming Temple, he vigorously promoted the vinaya, his reputation in the Way was lofty and sublime, and he was honored by his time. In the second year of Qianfeng, the Great Master established a precept platform at Jingye Temple. Accomplished masters from far and near arose in their hearts and came. The Master also participated in that assembly. Later it is not known where he died. Among his writings were *Commentary on the Practice Manual* in over four thousand volumes. Later Vinaya Master Juexian extracted the essentials and organized them into ten volumes.

**Tang Dynasty Master Daci of Ximing Temple**
The Vinaya Master's name was Daci. It is not known what place he was from. His family lineage is also not detailed. He was a disciple of Great Master Chengzhao. By nature intelligent and quick, his doctrinal understanding constantly surpassed his companions. He regularly opened Dharma seats and supported and praised the sectarian vehicle. Those newly admitted under his seat were all phoenixes of the time, such as Ling'e of Chongsheng Temple and others. The Master once composed *Commentary on the Practice Manual* in several volumes. From the Li Tang through the Zhao Song dynasties, those who commented on the *Practice Manual* numbered about sixty schools. The Master was the first of these.

The eulogy says: Once the *Practice Manual* appeared, successive dynasties treasured it no less than coral and rare wood. Therefore commentators reached as many as sixty schools, and Master Ci was their leader. His merit in supporting and praising the ancestral teachings was abundant.

Someone said: "Master Ren of Guangming also composed commentary records. Why do you now consider Daci as the beginning?" I replied: "According to old records, Master Ren is not included among the sixty schools, while Daci ranks first. I therefore follow this now." He said: "Why did the old records particularly omit Master Ren?" I replied: "Not only Master Ren - figures like Master Che of Yunmen who wrote the *Source-Tracing Record* were also omitted. This shows that only sixty people were listed. This was simply recording based on what was known at the time."

**Tang Dynasty Master Wengang of Chongsheng Temple in the Capital**
The Vinaya Master's name was Wengang. His secular family was Kong, and he was from Kuaiji. His father Dingsheng made Confucianism his profession and was also conversant with Buddhist teachings. His mother was of the X family. When she was pregnant with the Master, she rejected mixed foods. There was a Brahmin monk carrying a bowl begging for food who said to his mother: "The child in your womb will in the future continue and glorify the Three Jewels." From then on there were always auspicious signs of extraordinary fragrance and celestial music. On the day of his birth, white cranes soared and gathered as if coming to observe. While still in swaddling clothes, after noon he would not accept milk, just like one who firmly maintains fasting. As a child his aspirations yearned for the Buddha Vehicle. At twelve he was tonsured and ordained; at twenty he received full precepts. As a person he was upright and simple, never uttering a single false word. He took carrying the Dharma as his aspiration and encouraged himself through austere practice. Wearing hemp robes on grass mats, eating mallow and goosefoot soup, he was content. Initially he served Great Master Chengzhao, attending morning and evening, daily increasing his learning and understanding. Later he personally studied under Vinaya Master Daocheng and ascended to his inner sanctum. At twenty-five, through lecturing on vinaya he established his reputation. Those from the four directions seeking instruction came like clouds gathering and surging seas. The Way of Dharma-Upholding thereby

became greatly flourishing. The Master frequently had spiritual anomalies. Those with insight considered that he had attained supernatural powers. In early Yonglong, Tripiṭaka Master Yijing was translating in the capital. The Master participated in doctrinal verification. In the fourth year of Chang'an, following an imperial edict he went to Wuyou Wang Temple in Qizhou to welcome true body relics. In the second year of Jinglong, Emperor Zhongzong Xiaohe invited him into the inner palace sanctuary to perform walking practice, and sent relics to Wuyou Wang Temple to be stored in the stupa. That year the Master conferred precepts on palace nuns at Qianling Palace. He also spent the summer retreat in the palace, lecturing on the *Four-Part Vinaya* once for the palace nuns of the Two Sages. The Emperor was increasingly delighted and bestowed various goods and colored silk - thirty bolts. The Master reported matters of spiritual responses in the sanctuary. The Emperor considered this marvelous and bestowed the temple plaque reading "Spiritual Response." During the Xiantian years, Emperor Ruizong invited the Master into a separate hall to serve as bodhisattva precept master. From imperial consorts and princesses to ministers and officials, none did not bow in reverent faith. The Emperor presented over three thousand bolts of silk as a gift. All faithful donations the Master received he returned entirely to the permanent community property to support construction and renovation. Therefore halls, pavilions, gates, corridors, lecture halls, and sutra towers were magnificent and brilliantly ornate like heaven-created and earth-emerged formations. Other facilities like kitchens, storehouses, and residential quarters were all complete. On the fifteenth day of the eighth month of the fifteenth year of Kaiyuan, he peacefully passed away. His reported lifespan was ninety-two years. Summer retreats seventy-two. Both clergy and laity who heard the death announcement all mourned and grieved. On the fourth day of the ninth month he was entombed beside the temple. Those attending the funeral numbered tens of thousands. Incense, flowers, banners and canopies noisily filled the roads. Throughout the vinaya community all mourned together saying: "The pillar and beam of the Dharma edifice has broken." The extent to which the Master's Way thoroughly permeated people can thus be known. The Master once drew blood from his fingertips to write sutras - about six hundred volumes in total. He renovated monasteries at over twenty locations. Disciples receiving full precepts numbered several thousand. Outstanding among them were Dao'an of Huainan, Shenji of Shu and Chuan, Huiyi of Qi and Long, Shenhui of the capital region, and over fifty others

people. Prefect Li Yong of Huatai composed an inscribed stele honoring his virtue.

The eulogy says: When the kalaviṅka bird is still in the egg, its voice surpasses all other birds. When a lion cub emerges from the womb, its majesty awes all beasts. Things naturally have those that are heaven-endowed. Now observing Master Gang knowing to observe fasting while still in swaddling clothes - this was not solely due to exceptional natural endowment, but rather unforgotten habitual practices from past lives. In the end he cultivated his mind, refined his conduct, promoted the Dharma and saved beings, to the point where his virtue penetrated the royal court and his name resounded throughout the realm. Indeed he did not fail to fulfill the words of that divine monk of former days. How extraordinary!

**Tang Dynasty Master Huining Biography** 
Vinaya Master Huining was from Chengdu in Yizhou. From childhood he was outstanding and intelligent, remarkably different from ordinary people. After tonsure he joined the ranks of the Three Jewels. He revered supreme principles like a topknot jewel and abandoned glory and splendor like discarding sandals. He refined himself in the various sutras while walking alone in vinaya texts. His conduct and deportment were especially pure. His intention focused on broad benefit. During the Linde years he wished to go to India to seek the Dharma. He took ship and traveled west. His route passed through Java, where he stayed for three years. Together with Jñānabhadra, from within the Āgama sutras he translated passages about the Tathāgata's nirvana and body-cremation. This corresponds with Mahāyāna

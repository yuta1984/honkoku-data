He assisted and supported the vinaya way. His determination and integrity were steadfast, and he never showed joy or sorrow in his countenance. He always made meditation and contemplation his primary task, seeming as if he would mutually forget the world. At the time of his death, he rinsed his mouth clearly, arranged his appearance, admonished his various disciples, and suddenly passed away. His lifespan is not detailed.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Huixiao of Renshou Temple, Puzhou, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Huixiao, lay surname Liu, from Pengcheng. From childhood he stood out from the crowd, dignified and intelligent. At eighteen he became a scholar and was skilled at explaining poetry and ritual. The prefecture recommended him based on his mastery of the classics. The Master secretly thought: "Poetry and ritual are indeed good, but they are merely worldly dharmas. If I wish to seek the transcendent realm, on whom shall I rely if not the followers of Śākya?" He abandoned his home and took the tonsure on Mount Songgao. Eventually he received full ordination, and his precept practice was pure and spotless. People of the time called him "the Upāli of Zhendian." In early Kaihuang, he traveled to Ye city and studied all aspects of sūtras and vinaya without exception. What he particularly excelled in was the *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya*. Hearing that Lingyan Temple on Mount Tai was a place where those with the Way resided, he went to live there. Before long he returned to the Central Peak. At that time Minglang of Longmen was the foremost upholder of vinaya in Hedong. Hearing that the Master's reputation for the Way was very great, he came seeking an audience. Though his age preceded the Master's, he fully observed proper etiquette in serving him as teacher. After a long time he announced his departure. The Master also accompanied him to Dinglin Temple at Longmen, staying wherever circumstances allowed. Initially he had no fixed residence. On Mount Matou there was Master Shanshan who gathered disciples and established practices. The Master also followed him to study meditation. Before long he took up his staff and wandered to various places. Famous scenic spots including Zhongtiao, Wangwu, great ravines, and deep forests - his footprints reached nearly everywhere. Ding Rong, Vice-Magistrate of Hedong Prefecture, admired the Master's transformative virtue and invited him to reside at Renshou Temple. The Master humbly complied with his wishes and extensively propagated the Vinaya Piṭaka. The five groups of practitioners came to rely on him like thirsty horses rushing to a spring. In his later years he studied and read the *Avataṃsaka*,

never putting down the scroll. When they requested the Master to become a *Vaipulya* lecture master, he humbly declined, saying: "I have not yet mastered the meaning of the sūtra. How could I be capable of this?" People of the time considered him both upright and honest. He passed away in the fourteenth year of Zhenguan. His lifespan was seventy-three. His monastic years are uncertain. He lectured on the *Nirvana Sutra* ten times. The disciples he ordained numbered several people.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Huiman of Puguang Temple, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Huiman, lay surname Liang, from Chang'an in Yongzhou. His father's name was Can, who served both Sui and Tang dynasties as Regional Inspector of Haizhou and other places. His mother, of a certain family, both loved goodness without tiring and revered the Buddha most deeply. The Master's nature was tranquil and quiet, pure and compassionate, emerging from his natural constitution. Whenever he saw monastic implements, he would invariably feel attachment and could not bear to part with them. When he saw worldly delicacies, he would immediately frown and reject them. At barely seven years old, he took no pleasure in worldly life and vowed to seek ordination. His parents, perceiving his intention, had him join Dharma Master Xian at Daxingshan Temple as a *quwu* (novice attendant). After receiving full ordination, he studied vinaya under Vinaya Master Zhishou of Hongfu [Temple]. Day and night he applied himself diligently, completely forgetting cold and heat. Before long he greatly opened lecture sessions, daily discussing the profound meanings of his school. Through this his excellent reputation spread widely. All the outstanding monks of the time followed and associated with him. In the third year of Zhenguan, he went to the villa of Military Advisor Wei in Fu city, responding to a request to lecture on vinaya procedures. That town suffered a conflagration in one day. Adjacent buildings connected to each other were burned and destroyed. The Master's residence was directly downwind, the situation was extremely urgent and was about to reach the monastery. Everyone was alarmed and helpless. The Master then asked for water and sprayed it out. Suddenly the fire was extinguished and they escaped harm. Observers all sighed in amazement. In the seventh year, Emperor Taizong issued an edict to establish a monastery and selected renowned virtuous persons from throughout the realm to

serve as abbot. Because the Master's learning and conduct far surpassed the ordinary, he was invited to be the founding abbot. Before long he again received an imperial order to preside over Hongjie Temple, greatly promoting the school's tradition. The six harmonies arrived together like deer. The Master's disciplinary conduct was stern and absolute, like a cliff wall of a thousand *ren*, and because of this the entire community was solemn. The pure regulations were greatly invigorated. At that time there was a nun at Jixian Temple who had many bad habits. She foolishly made images of Laozi, True Immortals and others, privately making offerings to them. The Master reproved her and carried out expulsion and punishment. She then changed the Daoist images into Buddhist images and placed them in the hall of Dayuan Temple. There was also a nun named Huishang from Zhengguo Temple who entered and exited the imperial palace and took monks' temples as her own property. The Master gathered the community and expelled her. The nun appealed to the Eastern Palace. [The Crown Prince] sent Chamberlain Du Zhenglin and others to resolve the expulsion matter. The Master held firm to the Dharma and would not comply. The community feared that disaster would befall them and forcibly resolved the matter. The Master sighed and was displeased for several days. The nun later came to the Master to apologize for her transgression. The Master never acknowledged her. His sternness was of this type. In the sixteenth year he suddenly contracted a minor illness. Clergy and laypeople from the four directions who came to inquire about his condition increased daily. The Master's responses were as usual. One day he gathered the community to bid farewell. He then ordered his attendants to bring out his possessions, all of which he dedicated to the Three Jewels. He ascended his seat, sat in lotus position, and passed away. This was actually the twentieth day of the fourth month of that year. He was fifty-four years old. His summer retreats are not detailed. When cremated, his tongue remained undamaged. They further burned it with oil and fire. Its color became even more red and lustrous. This was also caused by his perfect Dharma eye and pure and strict holy conduct. His disciple monks collected his tongue and bone relics and built a pagoda in a corner of the original mountain to bury them. Master Huisheng of Jinzhu Temple in the capital composed an inscription for the Master's pagoda. The Master lectured on the *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya* over thirty times. His writings include *Commentary on the Dharmaguptaka* in twenty volumes, which were valued in his time.

Praise says: Master Man's single spray of water extinguished a fire that reached the heavens. This was brought about by his spiritual power and

is nothing to wonder at. In the Han dynasty, Luan Ba served Emperor Shun as Imperial Secretary. One day he sprayed wine toward the southwest. When the emperor asked the reason, he replied: "My home county of Chengdu has a fire disaster, so I sprayed wine to make rain and rescue it." When they sent urgent dispatches to inquire, it was indeed so. The rain all had the smell of wine. Even such trivial techniques of the immortal families were like this, how much more so for Master Man whose mind-awakening was limitless? As for his tongue not being charred or putrefied in the fire bath, this should also be compared with [Kumārajīva] of Yao Qin.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Huijin of Mount Ji, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Huijin, from the Bao family of Shangdang in Lu Prefecture. From childhood his intelligence was exceptionally sharp. In his twentieth year, he followed the Buddhist clergy and gradually studied moral discipline and examination. He did not enjoy mingling with the world and vowed to pursue the monastic life. His parents would not permit this. He then followed their feelings, lived at home practicing purity, and became known for his benevolence and filial piety. Though he dwelt in the dusty world, his conduct was no different from a monk's. When his parents knew his will could not be bent, they then gave permission. At thirty years old, like a thin wild goose leaving its cage, he studied Buddhism at Fanjing Temple in the prefectural seat. After receiving ordination, he encouraged himself to study the vinaya section and gained considerable understanding of the principles of maintaining and violating precepts, what to permit and what to prohibit. At that time he heard scholars transmit [reports of] the reputation of Vinaya Master Hong of Xiang Prefecture and immediately went to him. After serving diligently for several years, he completely exhausted that school's profound learning. Then traveling on foot, he visited vinaya schools throughout north and south. There was no mountain or marketplace where he did not carry his staff to visit and inquire. He was exactly like a piece of cloud over Cangwu that follows the wind eastward and follows the wind westward. He thoroughly comprehended the profound mysteries of all the Tripiṭaka sacred teachings. There was a monk who knew his own talent and wisdom were inferior to the Master's. His heart was disturbed by the Master's ability and he secretly harbored jealousy. The Master said: "We mutually left the white [robes] and received instruction under the same master. To secretly add fly-whisk fanning - is this what is meant by Dharma kinship and Way affection? I have heard that the ancients who practiced non-contention

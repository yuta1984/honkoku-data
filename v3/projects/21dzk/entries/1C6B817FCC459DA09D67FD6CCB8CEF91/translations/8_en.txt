Four hundred and more years have passed. What is lacking in terms of precepts and vinaya is particularly extensive. Recently there was one from the Western Regions named Punyatāra who recited and produced the Sanskrit text of the *Daśabhāṇavāra Vinaya*. Master Śa (Kumārajīva) translated it for him, but when the text was more than half completed, Tāra suddenly passed away. Unable to complete the great work, regret and resentment ran very deep. I have heard that you carry this sutra with you. I am extremely pleased by this encounter. Could this convergence of mysterious fortune be merely human affairs? Surely you propagate the Way for the sake of beings and are moved by sensing the times. When this is struck, there must be people who respond, and surely your feelings would not begrudge this. If you could complete this sutra text for students of vinaya, reveal and demonstrate pure conduct, cleanse their ears and eyes, enable those just beginning their journey not to lose the supreme ford, and make those who bathe their minds in excellent undertakings daily more brilliant as sun and moon, this would be profound beneficence and thick virtue that both humans and spirits would equally feel. I humbly hope you will keep this in mind and not deviate from your kind attention." The Venerable received the Dharma Master's letter and Yao Xing's invitation, and so together with Master Śa translated the *Daśabhāṇavāra*. They researched carefully and examined thoroughly, determining the regulations with precision. Thus the vinaya ceremony was greatly perfected. Afterward he resided at the Great Temple of Chang'an. Daochang Huiguan wanted to invite him to the capital. The Venerable said: "That land has people and Dharma sufficient to benefit the world. I should go to places where there is no vinaya teaching." Thereupon he drifted transcendently to teach and transform in other regions. None knew where he ended. Some say he passed away peacefully in Liang territory, but this is not certain.

Praise says: If a country has no ritual and punishment, how can it govern the world? If monks have no precepts and vinaya, how can they maintain and uphold the Buddha Dharma? Therefore it is said: The Vinaya Piṭaka is the lifespan of the Buddha Dharma. When vinaya abides in the world, then the Buddha Dharma abides.
Venerable Dharmakṣema was diligent in this Way and continued the Buddha's wisdom-life. First he responded to Master Yuan's request and proclaimed the translation of the *Daśabhāṇavāra Vinaya*. Next he declined Master Guan's invitation to go to places without vinaya teaching. How earnest was his heart devoted to the Way! Alas, if people could all be like the Venerable, the flourishing of the Great Dharma could be awaited within

a matter of days.

**Biography of Venerable Vimalākṣa of Shijian Temple, Shouchun, Jin Dynasty**
Venerable Vimalākṣa means "Stainless Eye" in Chinese. His surname was a certain family; he was from Kashmir. Born naturally intelligent and precocious, his aspirations and character were firm and pure. After leaving home and perfecting the precept categories, he made austere discipline his duty. Initially he propagated vinaya in Kucha, and his reputation in the Way captivated the four directions. Elderly masters and established scholars all hurried beneath his teaching seat to request instruction. One such person was Kumārajīva. When he encountered national upheaval, he took refuge in the land of Wucheng. After a while he heard that Rājaśrī had gone to Chang'an and greatly propagated the Sūtra Piṭaka. The Venerable also had intentions of propagating the vinaya Dharma. Therefore, not fearing the dangers of the flowing sands, he resolutely traveled eastward. In the eighth year of Hongshi of the false Qin, he finally arrived in Chang'an. When Rājaśrī heard of his arrival, he was extremely joyful and served him as teacher with full courtesy. After Rājaśrī's death, he traveled outside the passes and stopped at Shijian Temple in Shouchun, extensively expounding the Vinaya Piṭaka. Students gathered like spokes converging on a hub. Soon after he headed south to Jiangling, spent the summer retreat at Xin Temple, and began lecturing on the *Daśabhāṇavāra Vinaya*. Having already mastered the Chinese language, he skillfully received and accepted students. The wondrous foundation of unconditioned [dharma] was greatly expounded at that time. Those who analyzed texts seeking principles came in throngs like birds flocking to a forest. That the vinaya Dharma was greatly propagated was truly due to the Venerable's power. The Venerable once revised and retranslated Rājaśrī's *Daśabhāṇavāra*. Dharma Master Daochang Huiguan deeply grasped the essential principles and recorded the light and heavy internal prohibitions he established, organizing them into two volumes. Monks and nuns competed to copy and transmit it. A saying went: "Due to the copying by capital residents, paper became precious as jade." This still circulates in the world today. There is no scholar who does not follow it as a standard. The Venerable's personal characteristic was blue eyes, so people of the time called him the "Blue-Eyed Vinaya Master." Later he demonstrated nirvana at Shijian, enjoying a worldly lifespan of seventy-seven years. His monastic years were a certain number.

Praise says: Master Śa's realization level resided among the three worthy stages, and his sūtra translation originated with the Seven Buddhas. Princes and great people, monastics and laypeople, black-robed and white-clothed, men and women, looked up to him like a luminous banner. Yet toward the Blue-Eyed Venerable alone he maintained the courtesy of a disciple. Thus the Venerable's virtue and greatness can also be imagined.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Huiyou of Xin Temple, Jiangling, Liu Song Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Huiyou. His family name is not known in detail. He was from Jiangzuo. From childhood he was outstanding, not subject to worldly entanglements and restraints. He left home and studied the ultimate Dharma at Xin Temple in Jiangling. His nature was upright and direct, and he conducted himself simply and frugally. When he advanced to full ordination, he practiced śīla, thoroughly mastered the principles of opening and restraining, and constantly illuminated the mirror of joy and sorrow. At that time Venerable Vimalākṣa came from Shouchun and promoted vinaya. People throughout the realm looked up to him like an auspicious star or phoenix. The Master followed him and received instruction. Through genuine accumulation of effort over a long time, he wondrously mastered the *Daśabhāṇavāra*. Then his voice and radiance in expounding Dharma shone brilliantly throughout the monastic forest. There was no established scholar in Shanxi who did not look toward his influence with reverence. In his later years he announced his passing at his temple. His worldly lifespan and Dharma years cannot be determined. He once authored the *Daśabhāṇavāra Commentary* in eight volumes.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Sengye of Xianju Temple, Wu Province, Liu Song Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Sengye. His lay surname was Wang. He was from Henei. As a child he was intelligent and enlightened, transcending the vulgar and base. After receiving ordination and accepting the precepts, he extensively studied scriptures, and his wisdom and karma advanced daily. Later he traveled to Chang'an and received instruction under Tripiṭaka Master Rājaśrī. When he saw the newly produced *Daśabhāṇavāra*, he applied the effort of diligence and immediately penetrated its profound mysteries. Rājaśrī sighed and said: "He is the Upāli of the degenerate age." From this time his reputation and brilliance daily

surpassed others. It happened that Guanzhong faced many difficulties, so he departed and went to Jiangnan. The great patron Zhang Shao of Wu State founded a temple called "Xianju" (Leisure Dwelling). Honoring the Master's Way, he requested him to be the founding abbot. The Master made carrying and bearing the Great Dharma his responsibility, nurturing students diligently as if unable to keep up. Scholars from the three Wu regions who came carrying book bags arrived in continuous succession, shoulder to shoulder. Beyond lecturing and guidance, he bound his thoughts to chan meditation. Every time he sat in meditation, extraordinary fragrance filled the room luxuriously. None of those around him did not marvel at his spiritual extraordinariness. He passed away in the eighteenth year of Yuanjia at the age of seventy-five. His monastic years were a certain number. Those who received his Dharma and became leaders of their regions included Huixian and others. The Master once collated and corrected the *Daśabhāṇavāra Precept Text*.

Praise says: Huiyong of the Jin built a thatched hut on the mountain ridge. Whenever he wished to engage in chan contemplation, he would go and dwell there. When people came to the hut, all would smell extraordinary fragrance. Master Ye's situation was also similar to this. How could this not be the fragrance of pure conduct? Master Śa's admiration was not excessive.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Huixun of Changle Temple, Jingzhao, Liu Song Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Huixun, surname Zhao, from Zhao Commandery. In his youth he was intelligent and enlightened. After tonsure and full ordination, he disciplined himself with purity and austerity, his moral conduct dignified and stern. He encountered Dharma Master Zhuqian Shi opening the Dharma in Chang'an when the furnace bellows were burning red-hot. The Master went to receive tempering. He comprehensively mastered the Tripiṭaka, with the *Daśabhāṇavāra* and *Mahāsāṃghika* becoming most refined and extensive. Then he individually established regulations and principles that penetrated all ages. This was precisely the beginning of understanding the two vinayas. During the Yongchu era he returned and stopped in Guangling, greatly opening vinaya lectures. During the Yuanjia era he traveled to the capital and lodged at Daochang Temple. The head monk Huiguan was also proficient in the *Daśabhāṇavāra*. Considering that the Master's knowledge was extensive and conduct lofty, capable of serving as a model for humans and devas, he had him emerge into the world as a

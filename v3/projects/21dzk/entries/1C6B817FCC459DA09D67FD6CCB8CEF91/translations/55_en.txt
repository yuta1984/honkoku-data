[refined] the three studies, especially mastering the vinaya. He opened the Dharma at the Eastern Hall, and monastics joyfully followed him. Vinaya Master Fazheng served Weiyi as teacher, intensively researching the precept school and residing at Zhuxi to propagate the teaching. His fame grew day by day. Both were renowned masters of the lineage. Vinaya Master Fajiu was a disciple of Fazheng. He settled his mind in the sutras and vinaya, deeply exploring the profound mysteries. He opened vinaya lectures at Shigu and transformed [students from] the four directions. Scholars who took refuge with him increased daily. Previously, Vinaya Master Jiedu had composed commentary records on the *Amitābha Sutra* but passed away before completing it. At this time, Master [Fajiu] took up the brush to explain Jiedu's unfinished text. This is precisely the *Hearing and Retention Commentary*. In his postscript he wrote: "This commentary was composed by Master Zuan of the Foot Hermitage during the Chunxi years. When he reached the section on 'Eastern Buddha Manifestation and Penetration,' he became ill, stopped his brush and thereby passed away peacefully. He did not complete the full work. None who heard of this failed to lament with regret. Although the *Perfect Cultivation* and *Transcending Mysteries* commentaries circulate in the world, lecturers everywhere consider their text and principles unclear, and few adopt them. Due to this, even this commentary became blocked up. I was staying at Qingyuan Hermitage on Sanshan, and during the lecture series two or three students made a request, so I continued where it left off. This is truly reckless and simple, bringing shame upon what came before. Yet is this not like a green fly attaching to a fine horse's tail, also traveling a thousand li in a day?" His chief dharma successor was Vinaya Master Shangweng Miaolian.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Ruan Hong of Jingfu Temple, Siming, Song**
The vinaya master's taboo name was Liaohong, with the style name Ruan. His clan and locality are not detailed. He received instruction from Vinaya Master Fazheng. There was no section of the various vinaya texts he did not penetrate, and his reputation shone brilliantly. He went forth to reside at Jingfu Temple in Siming, expounding the vinaya teachings and instructing students. Those who followed and studied with him were like grass before the wind, flowing like water toward a valley. He had two chief dharma successors: Vinaya Master Shouyi of Rishan and Vinaya Master Junchou of this country.

**Biography of Three Vinaya Masters Liaoran, Zhirui, and Miaoyin, Song**
The three vinaya masters Liaoran, Zhirui, and Miaoyin all had bright and clear spiritual faculties with profound and deep learning. Ran resided at Bukong Cloister in Lin'an, Rui established himself at Jile Cloister in Kuaiji, and Yin dwelt at Jingfan Cloister in Lin'an. The Dharma drums competed in sounding, and near and far came to pay respect. During the Jiading years, Vinaya Master Junchou posed fifty-three doubts of the lineage school and questioned the vinaya masters of the time. The three masters examined these and answered each one by one. Ran once authored *Penetrating Truth Commentary* in three volumes and *Ritual for Conferring Bodhisattva Precepts* in one volume. Rui was skilled in literary composition and wrote *Profound Subtlety Collection* in ten volumes.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Miaolian of Guangfu Temple, Huxin, Song**
Vinaya Master Shangweng Miaolian—it is not detailed what locality he was from. He was the direct successor of Vinaya Master Fajiu of Shigu. There were no profound principles of the three baskets he did not thoroughly comprehend. He opened the Dharma at Guangfu Temple in Huxin. His reputation extended far, and monastics competed to flock to him. It was luxuriantly prosperous. He once engaged in doctrinal debates with Master Tieweng Yigong, and people admired this. He passed away at Jile Hermitage on the third day of the first month of the third year of Jingding. He was eighty-one years old and had sat for many summers. He has *Direct Discrimination of Thorny Analysis* in one volume. His dharma successor disciples include Xingjü and several others. Vinaya Master Shinsho of this country once sailed across the sea seeking the Dharma and received instruction from this master.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Tieweng Yi of Rishan Temple, Song**
The vinaya master was named Shouyi; Tieweng was his sobriquet. Heaven granted him intelligence and keen thinking that was remarkably outstanding. He studied the vinaya under Vinaya Master Ruan Hong of Jingfu. He penetrated the profound doubts of all the major and minor divisions. Through this his reputation spread in all four directions.

and the Way was revered by the seven groups [of Buddhist disciples]. He opened the Dharma at Rishan, Guangfu and various other temples. Those who came to seek instruction arrived in continuous succession. During the Shaoding period, he conducted re-ordination ceremonies at Jinfeng, and those who looked up to him increased even more. Vinaya Master Donzhao of this country also ascended his ordination platform. The master, relying on the meaning of the Lotus Sutra's revelation and disclosure, established the doctrine that those who receive full ordination through the white-four [karma] procedure need not additionally receive the bodhisattva precepts. He said that once the perfect substance is generated, the three collections [of precepts] are completely present. What would be the purpose of receiving them again? Shangweng Miaolian composed *Direct Discrimination of Thorny Analysis* to challenge this, establishing the doctrine of additional reception. This is because although the perfect substance is generated, the vows are not yet perfect. The master again composed *Analytic Clearing of Thorns through Teaching and Contemplation* to resolve the challenge. Moreover, he instructed the assembly saying: "One must embody the perfect meaning of the patriarchal masters and teach those who receive [ordination] to perfectly generate the three vows, perfectly accept the three collections, and perfectly accomplish the three practices. One cannot again rely on the four levels of the *Shangjie [jing]* and say that what is received on the ordination platform is merely a skillful means for the major precepts. This would not only demean and abandon the patriarchal intention but would also invite slander and insult from other schools." The master's end is not detailed. His disciples include Xinzhi and several others. His lifelong writings include *Zhongnan Family Legacy* in three volumes, *Collected Essentials of Analytic Clearing of Thorns through Teaching and Contemplation*, and several other volumes. During the Chunyou period, Liu Hounan composed a verse and wrote it after *Family Legacy*: "The thousand peaks of Nanshan are magnificent; propagating the vinaya is the ancestor of myriad dharmas. Though the mountain may sometimes crumble, this vinaya has no end. Chengzhao opened the Dharma channel, Great Wisdom expanded the family style. One lamp continues another lamp, transmitted to the Old Man of Turtle Mountain."

**Praise says:** Masters Miaolian and Shouyi both took Nanshan as their lineage, but their established doctrines were like mortise and tenon that do not fit together. Therefore later students argued right and wrong with each other, unable to reach any definitive conclusion. Master Bodhi Kong of our dynasty raised seven challenges to attack Yi and thereby support Lian. His explanation was certainly good. However, when I peruse and savor

the *Zhongnan Family Legacy*, Yi's doctrine is also not contrary to principle. Students should evaluate this with empty minds and calm spirits.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Xinju of Shilin, Song**
Vinaya Master Xinju was a dharma successor of Vinaya Master Miaolian. He was broadly learned with many accomplishments and clear about the Way of the vinaya. He once served at Shilin, Guangfu and various other temples. Wherever he went he showered torrential Dharma rain. Both monastics and laypeople all received its moisture. His end is not detailed. Vinaya Master Shinsho of this country once sought instruction from this master.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Wensi of Mingqing Temple, Lin'an, Song**
The vinaya master was named Wensi; his clan is not detailed. After tonsure and full ordination, he served as abbot of Mingqing Temple in Lin'an. His reputation was honored throughout the time. In the eleventh month of the sixth year of Chunyou, he memorialized [the throne about] Master Chengzhao of Nanshan's *Precept Commentary*, *Vinaya Commentary*, *Administrative Excerpts*, together with the three-part various commentaries composed by Vinaya Master Dazhi—seventy-three volumes in total—requesting that they be included in the Great Canon. This was approved by imperial decree. Subsequently, scripture publishing houses in various prefectures under the Ministry were [ordered to] carve printing blocks and distribute them.

**Praise says:** Dharma Master Zunshi of Tianzhu memorialized about Tiantai teaching texts and received imperial approval for inclusion in the Great Canon. From then on those books gained even greater brilliance. Now observing Master Si's actions, he was truly the Master Shi of our school. How deep was his mind of revering ancestors and protecting the Dharma!

**Biography of Vinaya Master Shixiang Yuanming of Great Puqing Temple, Jingzhao, Yuan**

thirty volumes; *Great Tang Internal Canon Catalog*, *Entrustment Procedures and Records of Spiritual Communications*, *Later Collection of Biographies of Eminent Monks* - ten volumes each; *Buddhist-Daoist Doctrinal Balance* in four volumes; *Essential Collection from Various Sūtras* in twenty volumes; *Nanshan Literary Collection* in ten volumes. Other abstracts, annotations, transmissions, records, procedures, collections, illustrated records, etc., are detailed in the *Compilation and Collection Record*. His *Practice Manual*, *Precept Commentary*, *Karma Commentary* and various other works used the meaning of the Lotus opening and revelation and Nirvana supporting discourse to resolve and clarify the vinaya, all returning to the true Way. In illuminating circumstances and conditions as well as receiving and following practices, all are immediately one mind with nothing that is not consciousness-only and mind-only teaching and practice. The perfect and sudden doctrinal principles were thereby greatly manifested. In early Tianbao, Prefect Li Yong of Lingchang composed an inscribed stele recording his virtue. During the Dali period, Emperor Daizong issued an edict that every year the great inner palace should send out one packet of incense to Ximing Temple to burn in the Master's portrait hall, praying for the prosperity and peace of the nation. During the Changqing period, Emperor Muzong, longing for and admiring the Master's virtue, bestowed an imperial eulogy saying: "Each age has enlightened ones who serve as messengers of the Tathāgata. Dragons and spirits submit and descend, heavenly beings serve and attend. His voice flies to the Five Indias, his words startle ten thousand li. The golden crow sets in the west, the Buddha-sun rises in the east. We bow our heads in refuge - he was the founding king of the Vinaya school." In early Dahe, Hanlin Academician Wei Chou also erected a stupa in the western corridor. In early Huichang, Ministry of Works Vice Director Yan Yuanben composed the inscription for the Master's stupa. In the tenth year of Xiantong, Emperor Yizong bestowed the title "Great Master Chengzhao" (Clear Illumination). The stupa was called "Pure Light." In the second year of Chongning of the Song, Emperor Huizong added the posthumous title "Great Master Fahui" (Dharma Wisdom). To be honored by successive dynasties of kings and nobles was like this. During the Dazhong Xiangfu period, Sanskrit monk Juecheng came to the capital and said to Minister Ding Jin: "I wish to venerate and bow to Vinaya Master Xuan's stupa." The minister said: "There are very many sages and worthies in this land. Why do you seek this one alone?" He replied: "The Vinaya Master's name is revered throughout the Five Indias. If it were not for his brilliant and outstanding radiance illuminating past and present, how could this be so?" The Master's lifelong actual deeds

are recorded in detail throughout written records and cannot be exhausted here. We especially record only the general outline.

The eulogy says: When the Enlightened Emperor (Buddha) bestowed his transforming influence, his intention was for one matter only. If one acts for the conditioned merit and rewards of humans and gods, then how would this differ from wheel-turning monarchs, Brahmā kings, and ordinary kings? Therefore, from the famous teachings of one age down to the subtle good of the Three Refuges, there is nothing that is not for the sake of causing sentient beings to proceed toward the One Buddha Vehicle - how much more so the complete vinaya precepts! The school of Dharma-Upholding, since Dharmarakṣa's initial advocacy, has never lacked accomplished masters of transmission and study through successive generations. However, the various schools competed and conflicted, unable to achieve unity, and the practical planning and strategies also had not yet become glorious and great. Only our Great Master Chengzhao, with heaven-bestowed spiritual awakening, was able to thoroughly investigate the Buddha's original intent. According to the subtle purport of the Lotus and Nirvana opening and supporting teachings, he directly revealed that precepts and vinaya are precisely the perfect vehicle. He wished to cause those who cherish the Way to open diagrammatic understanding, establish perfect practice, ascend to perfect stages, and realize perfect fruition. His merit is vast and inconceivable. Throughout a thousand years above and below, he stands out prominently like a high peak rising from a plain, leaping into the sky. Therefore Venerable Piṇḍola sighed that "since the Buddha's nirvana, during the Age of Semblance Dharma abiding in the world, only the Master alone has promoted and developed the vinaya." Is this not so? If heavenly beings manifest bodies to discuss vinaya, groups of dragons change form to listen to Dharma, and it extends to heavenly kitchens offering provisions and heavenly children serving as guards - this too is what supreme virtue brings about and can be clearly trusted. Alas! Even if we exhausted all the pines of Culai Mountain to make ink, and cut all the bamboo of Qi Garden to make writing brushes, how could we praise and eulogize even one ten-thousandth of this?

**Tang Dynasty Master Xuanyun Daoshi of Ximing Temple in the Capital**
The Vinaya Master's name was Daoshi, Xuanyun being his courtesy name. He was born to the Han family. His ancestors were people of Yique. Through generations of official service, they became people of the capital region. The Master's appearance and bearing were pure and extraordinary, his intelligence and quickness unusual.

His parents cherished and loved him and would not permit it. After a long time he achieved his heart's desire and entered Qinglong Temple to have his hair cut. At that time he was twelve years old. In the eleventh year of Sui Daye, together with Vinaya Master Xuan, he followed Great Master Shouhe of Hongfu and received full ordination. His protective upholding and faithful service was like carrying a bowl of oil. He peered into all of the Tripiṭaka, and in the vinaya school alone he reached the subtle and attained the ultimate. Therefore his fame and reputation grew daily more flourishing. During the Xianqing period, the Great Emperor had the sūtras and treatises translated by Master Xuanzang brought into the palace, and issued an edict to the great virtuous ones of Cien Temple to take turns performing walking practice without interruption. The Master was also selected for this. The Emperor also built Ximing Temple for the Crown Prince and summoned the Master to oversee it. The Master always worked equally with Vinaya Master Xuan to proclaim the transforming influence. The outstanding talents of the time all admired his moral style. He entered nirvana in the first year of Hongdao. His lifespan is not detailed. The Master once lamented that the teaching treasury was vast and profound, making it difficult for scholars to study. He then gathered the finest essences from the literary garden and savored the jasmine flowers of great meaning, compiling them into a collection. He titled it *Dharma Garden Pearl Forest*, totaling one hundred volumes. It took about ten years to complete. The Emperor ordered it included in the Great Canon and distributed throughout the realm. Scholars found it convenient. He also wrote *Treatise on Good and Evil Karmic Retribution* in twenty volumes, *Diamond Prajñā Collected Annotations* in three volumes, *Mahāyāna Contemplation* in one volume, *Meditation Gate Contemplation of Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna* in ten volumes, *Treatise on Reverent Merit* in three volumes, *Four-Part Vinaya Essential Discussions* and *Four-Part Vinaya Nun Manual* in five volumes each, *Precept Receiving Procedures* in four volumes, and *Buddha Worship Procedures* in two volumes. All circulated at the time.

**Tang Dynasty Master Daocheng of Hengji Temple in the Capital**
Vinaya Master Daocheng - it is not known what place he was from. In youth he was brilliantly talented with outstanding insight surpassing others. After receiving ordination and full precepts, he dwelled in Tianyi and grandly expounded the vinaya vehicle. His virtuous reputation became established and the four assemblies revered him.

During the Xianqing period he spread and proclaimed the Four-Part Vinaya. The dragons and elephants of that time all came to receive intimate instruction under his teaching seat. People like Wengang and Huaisu were among them. During the Chuigong years, Tripiṭaka Master Rizhao translated sūtras at Guangfu. The Empress Wu issued an edict for ten accomplished monks to assist in this Dharma transformation. The Master, together with Mingxun, Jiashang and other worthies, jointly undertook the responsibility of doctrinal verification. Therefore his reputation increased in weight within the saṅgha community. Later there is no record of his end. His Dharma-transmitting disciples were very numerous.

**Tang Dynasty Master Manyi of Chongfu Temple in the Capital**
The Vinaya Master's name was Manyi. His family lineage and place of origin are not known. His spiritual demeanor was lofty and outstanding, his understanding capacity broad and harmonious. After receiving precepts, he concentrated exclusively on vinaya studies while also mastering sūtras and treatises. At that time Vinaya Master Fali of Ye capital composed commentaries to promote Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. His virtuous reputation was loftily high. The Master went directly to study under him, holding up his robe hem to request instruction. Morning and evening he was never lazy. Thus he obtained his Dharma. For thirty years he lectured and guided. Those who received his teachings could not be counted on fingers. The leading disciples who transmitted his Dharma were Wenhui, Fazang, Yuanzhi, Sihui, Quanxiu, Huirong, Daliang, Zhaoyin, Dingbin and others - sixteen people in total. All were outstanding leaders of the saṅgha.

**Tang Dynasty Master Zhou Biography**
Master Zhou - his surname, personal name and life circumstances are not detailed. He was the direct successor of Great Master Chengzhao. He moved skillfully through vinaya teachings with transcendent understanding and interpretation. Later he resided at a great temple, proclaimed and promoted the sectarian principles, and widely transformed the four directions. None of the outstanding worthies of the time did not respect and look up to him. His Dharma-heir disciples were very numerous: Daoheng, Zhiming, Zhichan, Fayan, Faxing, Zhixiang, Qingfa, Weiqian, Yiwei, and [text cuts off]

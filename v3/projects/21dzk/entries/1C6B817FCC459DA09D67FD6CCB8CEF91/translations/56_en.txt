[He] traveled extensively throughout the Heluo region, visiting lecture halls everywhere and researching the vehicle of teachings. Soon he studied the *Four-Part Vinaya* as well as the *Lotus*, *Prajñāpāramitā*, *Consciousness-Only*, and *Logic* under Master Wen. His wisdom and understanding were heaven-bestowed, surpassing his peers. Master Wen said to him: "The burden is heavy and the Way is long," entrusting him with the mission of propagation and transmission. The master, before a Buddha image, burned his skin and lit his fingers, piercing [them] to write sutras in blood, thereby manifesting his reverence for the Dharma. He then retired to Mount Wutai, where his feet did not cross the threshold for six years, reading through the five thousand volumes of the canon three times. Through this his learning advanced and his practice was cultivated, his reputation becoming widely known. The Imperial Preceptor commanded the master to lecture and expound on the *Prajñāpāramitā*. [The Preceptor] thereupon sighed and said: "How can such a monk exist in the lands of Han!" The clergy and laity of the three auxiliary [capitals] admired the master's virtue and urged Master Hui to send a letter requesting his return to Chang'an. The master secretly reflected: "A disciple's relationship to his teacher is like that to a lord and father. How dare I not respectfully accept the command of father and teacher?" He then took up his staff and went west. When the clergy and laity heard of the master's arrival, they joyfully exclaimed: "The people of our region have found someone to be their teacher and receive instruction!" Soon, by command of the Prince of Anxi, he opened lecture halls at Yishan Temple south of the city. Students flocked to him like clouds, reaching ten thousand in number. Emperor Renzong heard of the master's worthiness, summoned him to court, and by imperial decree appointed him abbot of Dayuan Temple, conferring upon him the rank of Grand Master for Glorious Emolument and Grand Tutor. Not long after, he was commanded to serve at Great Puqing Temple and was additionally granted the titles of Grand Tutor with Silver Seal of the First Rank, Opening Prefecture, and Identical Treatment with the Three Excellencies. Through this, ministers and great officials looked up to his lofty character, like auspicious stars and phoenixes as omens in enlightened times. The emperor also bestowed upon him the title Vinaya Master of True Form, Perfect Brightness, and Radiant Teaching, along with precept sutras written in gold. On the twenty-fourth day of the third month of the fourth year of Yanyou, he passed away sitting in lotus position. His worldly age was fifty-eight, with thirty-eight years since ordination. When this was reported, the emperor was moved with sorrow for a long time. He bestowed tens of thousands of strings of cash for the funeral and furthermore decreed that high ministers should escort the funeral procession. The relevant offices prepared ceremonial guards with banners and canopies to accompany it. After cremation, relics were obtained and stored in a

stupa. His ordained disciples numbered many, and those who received precepts from him were countless.

**Praise says:** Master Wen retired to Mount Wutai for six years, read through the canon three times, burned his finger joints as offerings to the Buddha, and used his finger blood to write the contract sutras. These were the aspects of his achievements visible in minute details. Yet even these were so outstanding—how much more so his greater [accomplishments]! Alas, this is why he was selected by the imperial court for his virtue and his reputation extended beyond the seas. Someone asked: "The *Brahmajāla* and *Śūraṅgama* [sūtras] praise the practice of burning fingers and lighting incense, but the vinaya states that violating regulations incurs a minor offense. If one follows the sutra passages, then the vinaya regulations are violated; if one relies on the vinaya regulations, then the sutra passages are not followed. What should be done?" I say that Patriarch Master of Zhiyuan distinguished this with three cases: First, if one directly receives the major precepts according to the *Brahmajāla*, following the essence in upholding them, burning [offerings] is all the better. Second, if one only receives the minor precepts with status limited to bhikṣu, not burning accords with the original and accomplishes maintenance; burning follows the compilation and creates violation. Third, if one additionally receives the major precepts and is called a renunciant bodhisattva, burning accomplishes maintenance while not burning creates violation. Whether first minor then major, or first major then minor, both follow the judgment of the major [precepts] and do not violate the disciplinary rules. This is a definitive discussion. For renunciant bodhisattvas, that they should burn [offerings] is without doubt. However, there are those in the world who do this to seek people's material support and aim for worldly reputation. Since this is an evil cause, it will necessarily attract evil results. Alas, should this not be prohibited?

He took leave and ascended to Youxi Temple on Mount Tiantai, visited Dharma Master Wujin, and thereupon completely grasped the essential points of this school's teaching and contemplation. He also engaged in back-and-forth discussions with ancient worthy dharma masters Lingyuan and Xuesong, all of whom admired his precision and acuity. There was one called Dharma Master Suhua, a doctrinal tiger of the lecture seat. They were kindred spirits at first meeting and thereupon formed a life-and-death bond. Because people in the final age have many wild interpretations, they resolved to mutually retreat deeply to Zhongnan, practice Lotus Samādhi, and attain realization in this lifetime. Their path led through Mount Jiuhua, where they were detained by others. Unexpectedly, news of Master Man's death arrived. Having no choice, he parted from Su and hurried back to conduct the funeral. At this time his reputation for the Way was very great, and scholars and officials competed to be the first to seek audience. The master taught the Dharma according to circumstances, providing much inspiration and guidance. Officials like Inspector Xitang Chen and Literary Master Jinggu Huang both received precepts under his seat. They exchanged poems and verses. The master, knowing their affinity was ripe, again sent people to invite Dharma Master Su to come to Wenling and greatly propagate the Tiantai teachings. Su's transformative influence extending to far and near was all due to the master's efforts. One day he showed slight illness, took his lifelong writings and entrusted them to Zulong. He said to his disciples: "I will go down the mountain in the late morning. You should practice diligently without laziness." He again had someone invite Dharma Master Su to bid farewell. When Su arrived, the master pressed his palms together and said: "I deeply appreciate your dharma love." He then passed away sitting upright. This was on the twenty-sixth day of the seventh month of Chongzhen jimao year. His worldly age was fifty with some years of monastic seniority. Throughout his life he maintained the vinaya

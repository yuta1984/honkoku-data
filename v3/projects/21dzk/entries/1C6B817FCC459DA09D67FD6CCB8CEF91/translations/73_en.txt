[This refers to the previous Mañjuśrī statue]. In the 2nd year of Karyaku (1327), Emperor Go-Daigo posthumously honored the master's virtue and bestowed upon him the title of Bodhisattva.

The encomium states: Kōshō Bodhisattva used the path of vinaya to cultivate scholars throughout the realm. The master truly emerged prominently from among his disciples, was able to establish the banner of the true Dharma, and became magnificently the leader of the community in that region. His spiritual resonance was as lofty as the North Star and Mount Tai, and his virtuous reputation was fragrant like orchids and cassia. Moreover, his nature was extremely compassionate, and there was nothing he would not do that could benefit beings. Alas, a person like this master cannot be seen even once or twice among a thousand or hundred people. That he was posthumously titled "Bodhisattva" was truly appropriate.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Kenritsu Shun of Tōeiji**
The vinaya master's religious name was Genshun, and Kenritsu was his title. After leaving lay life he resided in the Southern Capital. During the Kateei era (1235-1238), when Vinaya Master Jōyū Teishun established lectures at Kairyūōji, the master attended as a student. Later he went sightseeing in the capital and entered under Vinaya Master Getsuō Kyō, studying the sectarian teachings and thoroughly investigating their profound principles. He then went to meet Vinaya Master Ensei, and finding their teacher-student relationship harmonious, he became an inner-chamber disciple. Later he presided over Tōeiji in the Kantō region, spreading the Dharma widely so that all beings were equally moistened. The details of his final years are unknown.

**Biographies of the Two Vinaya Masters Jijaku and Yuidō**
Vinaya Master Jijaku's religious name was Kenkū, and he was a disciple of Kōshō. In the 2nd year of Ninji (1241) he received full ordination, and in the 5th year of Bun'ei (1268) he received abhiṣeka. There was nothing in the two teachings of vinaya and esoteric Buddhism that he did not master completely. Later he resided at Kairyūōji and greatly practiced spiritual transformation. His end is unknown.

Vinaya Master Yuidō's religious name was Jishun. In the 2nd year of Kōchō (1262) he received the ten precepts at Saidaiji, in the 5th year of Bun'ei he received complete abhiṣeka, and the following year he progressed to full ordination. His learning was excellent

and outstanding, towering like a mountain of the Way.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Dōgo Enkaku of Hōkongōin in the Capital**
The vinaya master's religious name was Shūkō, his courtesy name was Dōgo, his family name was Ōtori, and he was from Hattori in Iga Province. His father's name was Hiromoto. He once visited the shrine of Kasuga Myōjin to pray for a child, setting a period of one hundred days. When the period ended he received an auspicious dream, and his wife then became pregnant. He was born in the 2nd year of Jōō (1223). At the tender age of three his father died, and his widowed mother could not raise him. So she wrote his clan and native place on his clothing collar and abandoned him beside Tōdaiji. At that time there was Lord Umemoto who, while visiting Kasuga Shrine, found and raised him. When he reached the age of learning he shaved his head at Tōdaiji and received śrāmaṇera precepts. At eighteen he entered Suganharadera and properly copied the Lotus Sutra to praise his deceased father's spiritual welfare. That year he went to Shōdaiji and received full ordination from Vinaya Masters En and Gen. There was nothing about the principles of what to uphold, what constitutes violations, what is permitted, and what is prohibited that he did not thoroughly investigate. He also studied the Lotus, Śrīmālā, Vimalakīrti and other sutras at Hōryūji, and received the two-division esoteric teachings at Reisanin. From this time his reputation grew daily. The master constantly thought about meeting his mother without cease. He visited the Yumedono (Dream Hall) of Prince Jōgū and prayed with utmost sincerity. The Prince spoke through a small child, saying: "If you wish to fulfill your aspiration, you must chant the Yūzū Nenbutsu to guide and encourage the four assemblies." The master could not contain his joy. He went to Hōkongōin in the capital and greatly established Yūzū Nenbutsu assemblies. Thereupon monks and laypeople gathered as one, with even farmers laying down their plows and weavers throwing aside their shuttles to come. The crowd totaled one hundred thousand. The master then established great feasts for them, making vows and dedicating merit to adorn the pure reward. This continued repeatedly without end. Therefore people of the time called him "One Hundred Thousand Saint." Word of this reached the court, and Emperor Go-Uda bestowed upon him the title

**Left Page Upper Section**
"Saint Enkaku." The master also established nenbutsu assemblies at Seiryōji in Sagashima, and those who inclined toward him became even more numerous. He frequently visited Mount Atago, which was the sacred site of Jizō Bodhisattva. He thought that the Bodhisattva's spiritual power would surely provide hidden assistance for his wish to find his mother. One day a strange monk told the master: "You should go to Harima Province to search - you will meet her immediately." Having spoken, he suddenly disappeared. The master knew this was a manifestation of the Bodhisattva. He immediately went there as instructed. While traveling through Innami Plain, he encountered sudden rain and rested under a tree. Nearby was a blind old woman. When the master curiously asked about her clan and locality, it was his mother! Here mother and son met, with sorrow and joy intermingled. However, he felt regret that his mother's eyes had lost their sight, so he silently invoked Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva. Suddenly her sight was brilliantly restored. Those who saw and heard of this all clicked their tongues in wonder and admiration. The master returned to his native place together with his mother, and at his father's former site discovered a buried treasure. He then built a temple on that land and performed great Buddhist services to increase spiritual rewards. The master recalled having once prayed to Jizō Bodhisattva and Prince Shōtoku, so he built a Jizō Hall at Seiryōji and installed images of the Bodhisattva and the Prince in the hall. During the Kagen era (1303-1306), Vinaya Master Shinshō of Shōdaiji passed away, leaving his position vacant. The community requested the master to fill it, but the master declined and specifically recommended Vinaya Master Kinshō to take his place instead. On the 29th day of the 9th month of the 1st year of Ōchō (1311), he passed away sitting in meditation while chanting the nenbutsu. His countenance was ruddy and fresh as if alive. At that time there were auspicious signs of unusual fragrance and celebratory clouds. He lived eighty-nine years and sat for seventy-one summers. His disciples erected a pagoda at Hōkongōin to commemorate his virtue. During his lifetime the master built thirty monastery complexes and taught 700,000 disciples from the four assemblies.

The encomium states: What fills heaven and earth and spans the four seas - is this not filial piety alone? All three teachings revere it, but

**Left Page Lower Section**
Buddhism especially reveres it. Therefore when the Buddha first established the great precepts, he said "Filial piety is called precept." Indeed, filial piety is what the great precepts place first. Precepts are what give birth to all good deeds. Without precepts, from where would goodness arise? Without filial piety, from where would precepts naturally arise? Vinaya Master Enkaku was precise in precepts and sincere in filial piety. He attained the Buddha World-Honored One's intention. Observing how through his single prayer his mother's eyes suddenly opened, this is exactly similar to the cases of Sheng Yan and Chen Yi - all were brought about by the response to filial devotion.

**Biography of Priest Jishin of Saidaiji**
The priest's religious name was Shinkū, his courtesy name was Jidō, and he was born in the 3rd year of Kanki (1231) to a certain family in Yamato Province. From childhood he had aspirations to transcend the dusty world. In the 3rd year of Ninji (1242), Kōshō Bodhisattva came traveling to teach at his home and lectured on the Brahmā's Net Sutra. When the master saw Kōshō, he was joyful as if meeting an old acquaintance. He requested of his parents to become his disciple. His parents, knowing there was a karmic connection from past lives, did not forbid it. So on the 16th day of the 2nd month of that year he went to Saidaiji, and Kōshō ordained him as a monk and conferred the five precepts upon him. At that time the master was twelve years old. Kōshō regarded him as a Dharma vessel and instructed him with careful attention. After progressing to full ordination, there was nothing about the profound meanings of various sections that he did not perceive clearly. During the Bun'ei era (1264-1275), when Kōshō restored Hannyaji in the Southern Capital, he appointed the master to preside over that position. From this time his reputation grew daily. In the winter of the 8th year of Kōan (1285), in the 11th month, when Kōshō consecrated Daigorinnji, the master performed the Dharma response. When the pagoda was built and completed, the master gathered the assembly and held a celebration assembly. In the 3rd year of Shōō (1290), when Kōshō passed away, the assembly chose the master to succeed at Saidaiji. This was because his virtue was weighty and the position naturally came to him. At this time he greatly promoted his spiritual father's path, and the four assemblies' taking refuge was like a hundred rivers flowing toward the great ocean. Emperor Kenji

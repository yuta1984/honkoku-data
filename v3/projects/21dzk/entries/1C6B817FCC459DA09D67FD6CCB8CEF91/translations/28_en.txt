The eulogy says: Like the above five masters, they headed west seeking the Dharma, crossing seas and climbing mountains, braving wind and frost across a thousand regions, carrying packs and wearing hats, treading through clouds and waters across ten thousand mountains. Their determination can be called firm and resolute, truly without shame before great elders like Faxian and Fayong. Alas!

Today one barely enters the monastic gate and sits peacefully in one room, not knowing how difficult it was for the ancients to seek the Dharma. This is like rich children not understanding the sufferings of common people, carelessly and frivolously wasting an entire lifetime. Is this not greatly lamentable?

The Master maintained vinaya with stern severity, his words and actions both arriving at their mark. Daily he recited the *Diamond Sutra* thirty times, never once becoming lax.

**Inscription for the Biographies of Monastic Treasures of the Vinaya Garden**

Master Kaisan of the eastern lakes region, Monk Kenjō, is broadly learned and possesses great aspirations. He once lamented that among the monastics of these latter days, many who possess wisdom and understanding often neglect the rules and standards. Therefore, he compiled the "Biographies of Monastic Treasures of the Vinaya Garden" in fifteen volumes. He wished to enable readers to organize their thoughts and sweep away old habits to become pure bhikṣus. How could such merit be shallow or insignificant? I praise his aspiration and compose this verse:

"Able to raise the vinaya banner and plant it at the ocean gate. I know that you have long participated in Jetavana Grove. Venerable Upāli undoubtedly has successors. Master Chengzhao now has grandsons. Rich in years and pure in virtue, who would not record this? With firm resolve and abundant learning, what more can I say? Personally compiling the history of monks in the Brahma garden, Forever serving as a lamp to break through great darkness."
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Written by the Mountain Elder of Kōsen, Buddha Land

**Author's Preface**

The Tamer of the Central Heaven manifested birth and taught the Dharma for forty-nine years. The transmission of his true Dharma consists of the Three Baskets: sūtras, vinaya, and treatises. Sūtras can be expounded by all Buddhas, bodhisattvas, devas, and immortals. Treatises can be composed by all worthy sages and monks. Only the vinaya alone was personally proclaimed by the Tathāgata's golden mouth. Even those of great spiritual authority and influence cannot add a single word. When he demonstrated nirvana at Crane Grove, Venerable Upāli orally recited the sacred words and compiled them into a collection, called the Root Section Eighty-Recitation Vinaya Great Vinaya Collection. Compared to the first century of the true Dharma, it branched into five schools. Later it further subdivided, becoming the eighteen, twenty-eight, and five hundred various schools. Although their establishments may appear different, what enables one to subdue worldly afflictions and ascend to marvelous enlightenment is singular. This is what is meant by "such various views do not obstruct the Buddha-realm of all Buddhas and great nirvana." Alas! Without those who possess great wisdom and abundant capacity, how could one be worthy of the responsibility of this path?

Long ago, during the Jiaping era of Cao Wei, Dharmakāla, as a sixth-generation dharma grandson of Kāśyapa, came from India and conducted full ordination ceremonies in Luoyang. Through this, China first came to know of vinaya rules. Soon after, those who received the precept transmission were numerous as a forest. Among those called excellent successors, there was only Fashong of the Northern Terrace. After Fashong, Daofu continued the lineage. After Fu, Huiguang succeeded. After Guang, Daoyun inherited it. Yun transmitted it through three generations to Hongfu Zhishou. Shou's outstanding disciple was called Master Chengzhao of Nanshan. The master, relying on the meaning of the Nirvana Sutra's universal teaching, proclaimed and clarified the sectarian principles, stood independently and distinctly, becoming a teacher of humans and devas for one generation.

Thus the path of the Dharma treasury spread throughout the four seas. During the Tenpyō-Shōhō era in our country, the master's dharma grandson Master Ganjin responded to the imperial invitation and crossed eastward, first transmitting this single lamp. Emperor Shōmu issued an edict establishing this at Tōdaiji monastery as a model for the entire realm. Those who rushed to study were like water naturally flowing downward. From that time onward, outstanding and extraordinary monks arose one after another, proclaiming the vinaya dharma and becoming national treasures, not inferior to India and China. Up to the present day, their fame resonates clearly throughout heaven and earth, brilliant as the sun and stars. How magnificent this is!

I have observed the records in the histories of the three dynasties and our country's Buddhist writings, and the eminent virtues of our school are too numerous to count. However, I have not yet seen a proper transmission record of our single lineage. Could this not be approaching a gap in the classic records? Moreover, in the three hundred-plus years since the Genkō era, it cannot be said there were no worthy people during this period. It is only that their noble conduct has gradually faded away, which is truly regrettable. If we who call ourselves their descendants do not turn our attention to this matter, then to whom does the responsibility of supporting the school belong?

Therefore, I broadly searched through the historical records of China and Japan as well as various separate records and scattered writings. I also sought out forgotten virtues in forests and hills, and studied broken steles among grass and weeds. From Dharmakāla onward, I found over three hundred individuals, composed biographies for each, added eulogistic verses, and divided them into fifteen volumes. I titled it "Biographies of Monastic Treasures of the Vinaya Garden." I secretly feel ashamed of my weak literary power. Though my intention has excess, my writing is insufficient to fully reveal the hidden brilliance of the former sages. It is only that my single thought of supporting the school is something I deeply cannot abandon.

The Book of Changes says: "Learn much about the words and deeds of the past to cultivate one's virtue." This compilation contains all the past words and deeds of the vinaya garden. If there are scholars who admire Yan Hui and long for Lin Xiangru, who savor this without forgetting and reverently look up to the former standards, changing their course to follow this path, then the true spirit of our ancestral masters will surely be restored today. We can hope not to

fail the original intention of the Tathāgata's teaching of the vinaya, and moreover, through this, ascend to the stage of marvelous enlightenment. This serves as the preface.

At the time when the year was in Lüqiang-wu-dān-an, on the first day of Kārttika month, the monk Ekeian Kaisan of Anyō Vinaya Temple respectfully wrote this in the Brahmajāla Chamber.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Daoying of Jianxin Temple, Jingzhao, Liu Song Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Daoying. His place of origin is unknown, nor are his family name and clan recorded in detail. Initially he studied meditation at Lingyao Temple, and later listened to vinaya teachings under the two Vinaya Masters Guanxun. Regarding the *Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya*, he was able to grasp its essential points. He could also recite and penetrate the *Lotus Sutra* and *Golden Light Sutra*. His nature was pure and supremely austere; he maintained moral principles in the Way and had a good reputation. The great elders of the time, such as Daohui of Zhuangyan Temple and Zhixiu of Yecheng Temple, all took his moral example as their teacher. In a certain year he accepted an invitation and went to Wu Commandery. Cai Xingzong, hearing of the Master's reputation in the Way, invited him to reside at Shangyu and treated him with special kindness. Before long, the donor Zhang Yong established Jianxin Temple at Louhu Garden in the capital and invited the Master to be the founding abbot. There he expounded the Dharma and the school's influence flourished greatly. Students from the four directions gathered under his seat. He departed the world in the second year of Shengming at the age of eighty-three.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Huiyou of Jianxin Temple, Qi Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Huiyou, of a certain family name, from Dantu. At the age of thirty he shaved his head, dyed his robes, and entered the Way. He disciplined his body with ascetic practices; his sincerity and faithfulness were profound and complete. After receiving full ordination, he intensively researched the vinaya teachings. His wisdom and understanding were outstanding. During the Jianyuan period he went east and gave lectures on the *Mahāsāṃghika* section. Prince Ziliang of Jingling valued the Master's exemplary conduct and invited him to the seat at Jianxin Temple in the capital. Later, where he ended his life is unknown.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Zhidao of Falun Temple, Qi Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Zhidao, family name Ren, from Henei. His nature was gentle, prudent, and plain. At seventeen he was tonsured and resided at Lingyao Temple on Mount Zhong. When he received full ordination, he was tireless in his studies. Among the Three Piṭakas, each held places in his heart, but

**Right Page Lower Section**
the Vinaya Piṭaka was where he was most keen and sharp. In ordinary life he was simple and honest, his upright character reaching to heaven. In his bare single room there were only robes and bowl. Minister He Shangzhi admired his conduct and character, observed the etiquette of a disciple, and established Falun Temple for him. He emerged into the world and opened the Dharma. Before this, the Wei barbarians had destroyed Buddhism, the vinaya sections were incomplete, and the transmission of ordination was also deficient. The Master then made a great vow and had the aspiration for restoration. He treated hardships and dangers as easy, not fearing toil and suffering. He gathered more than ten fellow practitioners and went out to Hulao, assembled Daoist masters from the five provinces of Luo, Qin, Yong, Huai, and Yu at Yinshui Temple, lectured on vinaya and renewed the ordination procedures, thus making the Way of vinaya complete again. This was truly through the Master's power. The Master later returned to the capital, and his reputation grew daily more weighty. The nobles and distinguished scholars of the time all looked up to his influence and paid their respects. In the second year of Yongming he passed away in Xiangzhou. His worldly life spanned seventy-three years, retreat seasons a certain number.

Praise says: The flourishing and decline of the Dharma-Way depends entirely on whether those who uphold the Dharma are virtuous or not. If one obtains such a person, even what has declined will flourish. If one loses such a person, even what flourishes will decline. The Way of vinaya, in the autumn of the Wei barbarians' destruction of the Dharma, was about to fall precipitously, like the Nine Tripods hanging by a single thread. Master Dao alone was able to exhaust his strength in support, causing this Way to revive from decline. He was truly the wooden bell of our Way, the guardian against regret of the vinaya school.

His natural disposition was brilliant and sharp; whatever his ears and eyes encountered, he remembered for long without forgetting. After receiving full ordination he resided at Gongfu Temple in Liangzhou. Though he was accomplished in all Three Piṭakas, he was renowned for vinaya. Together with Fali of the same temple they formed a perfect pair. At the end of Yuanjia he transferred to Xinting Temple. When Song Emperor Xiaowu went south and renovated that temple, appreciating the Master's

pure and sincere conduct, he appointed him by edict as Sangha Administrator of the capital. Soon he resigned the position and retired to Duobao Temple. He constantly engaged in binding meditation as if he would end his life in it. When Qi Emperor Gao ascended the throne, he established the Master as Sangha Leader. The Master had no choice but to accept. The vinaya tradition flourished greatly. The emperor's consolation and care were earnest and thorough, his favor and gifts especially abundant. Whatever donations the Master received, he touched not a hair of it for himself, using it all to create sūtra images and medicine repositories, which he established at Changgan Temple. He passed away in the fourth year of Jianyuan at the age of sixty-seven. His written works include the *Daśabhāṇavāra Prātimokṣa* along with *Karmavācanā* and others, numbering like a thousand volumes.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Falin of Lingjian Temple, Shu Commandery, Qi Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Falin, son of the Le family from Linqiong in Jinyuan. In his youth he left the decaying house [of worldly life], was tonsured and received full ordination. He stayed at Pei Temple in Shu Commandery. He devoted himself diligently to vinaya studies, focusing his mind on the *Daśabhāṇavāra*. His only worry was that there were no enlightened teachers in Shu. Soon Vinaya Master Sengyin came from western Liangzhou, his reputation in the Way spreading far and wide. The Master relied on him and received instruction. He disciplined himself, grasped his stylus, continued through the hours of night, burning oil for light. When Yin returned to western Shaanxi, the Master also followed and attended him for several years. There was no section of vinaya in which he did not achieve thorough penetration. He took his leave and returned to Shu, staying at Lingjian Temple. His excellent virtue and mysterious

influence were like orchid fragrance and moonlight. Monks and nuns from Yizhou who came to him were like a marketplace. Throughout his life the Master strictly cultivated pure practices, constantly reciting the *Amitāyus Sūtra* and the *Universal Gate Chapter*, never passing a day in vain. Whenever he moved about, he would see an imposing monk standing resolutely before him. In the second year of Jianwu he felt illness and focused his thoughts on the Western [Pure Land], performing prostrations and repentance without cease. He saw under jeweled trees the images of one Buddha and two great bodhisattvas seated on lotus flowers, with all the sages and saints gathered in the sky. The Master was greatly comforted and joyful. He summoned his disciples and said to them: "My Pure Land conditions have matured, the sages and saints all appear before me. I shall now depart." Having finished speaking, he joined his palms, closed his eyes and passed away. His years are not recorded in detail. His followers on a certain month and day gathered much wood and constructed a fragrant tower, employing the method of cremation. The smoke and flames reached to heaven, lasting for three evenings before ceasing. They gathered the sacred bones and built a stupa at the Xinfan road junction.

Praise says: Fish in the depths choose the deep waters, birds on high await the branches. Alas, even the small fish and birds know to entrust themselves to the high and deep. How could there be those with shaved heads studying the Way who abandon themselves to the shallow and crude? Master Lin worried about not obtaining an enlightened teacher and thus entered the gate of Vinaya Master Yin. Through morning consultation and evening instruction he matured into a beautiful vessel. Was this not one who escaped the shallow and crude to approach the high and deep? Moreover, he made the Pure Land his covenant as the land of true return, constantly earnest about this. Therefore he was able to manifest clear spiritual signs at the time of death. Even the ancient eminent monks of Mount Lu - what could surpass this?

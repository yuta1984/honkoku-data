day. He lived eighty-four years and sat through several summer retreat seasons.

**Praise says:** Long ago when Zengzi was lying ill, Zengyuan sat at his feet and a young attendant sat in the corner holding a candle. The attendant said: "How ornate and beautiful - this is a minister's bamboo mat, isn't it?" Zengzi said: "Yes, this is a gift from the Ji-sun family. I have not yet been able to replace it." Zengyuan got up to change the mat. Zengyuan said: "Master, your illness is critical. It should not be changed." Zengzi said: "Your love for me does not equal that child's. The gentleman loves people through virtue; the petty person loves people through expedient compromise. What do I seek? If I can obtain what is right and die, that is sufficient." They all lifted him to change it. He returned to the mat but before he could be comfortable, he died. Zengzi can be said to have upheld the Master's Way until death. Master Myōyū wore robes of subdued colors, ate from earthen bowls, and upheld the precepts of former buddhas as his duty. Because the day had passed noon, he transformed without eating. Comparing this to Zengzi, though their orientations were certainly different, in not changing what they upheld because of life and death's transformations, they were one. I have observed many people in the world who, when afflicted by illness, are strongly urged by relatives, friends, and lay doctors, so that even those who had long maintained fasting sometimes break and destroy it overnight. They do not know that the determination of life and death is not necessarily connected to fasting and precepts. This is truly lamentable. Someone asked: "Doesn't the vinaya allow sick people to eat repeatedly after noon? Why universally criticize this as wrong?" Alas, you have failed in investigation. What is called "repeated eating" refers to repeated eating before noon, not repeated eating after noon. The *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya* calls this "successive eating," the *Mahāsāṅghika Vinaya* calls it "eating here and there," the *Sarvāstivāda Vinaya* and *Mahīśāsaka Vinaya* call it "repeated eating." All vinayas clarify this repeatedly. There is no room for elaboration here. However, since the question has been raised, I cannot remain silent. The *Mahāsāṅghika Vinaya* says: "At that time the grain and wheat of the monastery's farmers ripened. They came to Jetavana and bowed their heads to the ground before

the monks, saying in white: 'So-and-so wishes to prepare offerings tomorrow and invite all the monks.' The monks immediately accepted the invitation. At that time there was a householder. He came to Jetavana, knelt with palms joined and said: 'Tomorrow I wish to invite the monks.' A monk said: 'The monks have already accepted an invitation. But please invite the monks to provide tomorrow's morning meal.' The monks accepted the morning invitation. Immediately the monks went to that house. The patron provided various delicious foods, and they ate to satisfaction. They immediately returned to the monastery. The farmer thought: 'The ācārya are one-meal people. I should provide early offerings.' He announced: 'The time has come.' Because the monks were full from the previous meal, though they saw the invitation arrive, it was as if they did not hear. The farmer thought: 'How strange, how strange.' He made various praises. The monks had already come and taken their seats. The farmer personally served food, filling ladles to give them. The senior monk raised his hand showing the appearance of taking just a little. Down to the junior monks, all did likewise. One late-learning mahallaka (elderly monk) said: 'We did not come today for food. We came for your intention. We have already eaten to satisfaction elsewhere.' The farmer was displeased and said: 'The ācāryas first accepted my invitation. Why do you also eat elsewhere?' He immediately went to the Buddha, bowed his head to his feet and spoke as above. The World-Honored One taught dharma accordingly, instructing, benefiting and gladdening. The Buddha immediately called those eating monks and said: 'From now on, eating here and there is not permitted.' Again, the World-Honored One was walking through the quarters and saw a sick monk. The Buddha, knowing but purposely asking, said: 'Monk, what is your ailment? Is it now increasing or decreasing?' He answered: 'My suffering is painful and does not decrease. Previously when I could eat repeatedly, my body obtained comfort. The World-Honored One established the precept prohibiting repeated eating, so my illness does not improve.' The Buddha said: 'From today, repeated eating during illness is permitted.' That non-times are not opened is clear. Not thoroughly studying vinaya texts and saying "repeated eating after noon" is extremely mistaken.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Jitsuban of Nakagawa Temple**
The vinaya master's name was Jitsuban, surname Fujiwara. He was the son of Counselor Akisane. In youth he left lay life and went to Kōfukuji Temple to study the Consciousness-Only school. His reputation shook the southern capital. After a long time he ascended Mount Daigo and received esoteric teachings from Master Gōkaku. The day before, Gōkaku had a dream: a blue dragon emerged from the garden pond and raised its head above the water's surface. He therefore instructed his disciples: "Today someone seeking teachings will surely arrive. You should sweep and wait." Indeed the master arrived. Greatly delighted, he exhausted his sincerity in conferring the teachings. He also studied Tendai teachings under Master Myōken of Yokogawa. Having mastered all schools, he lamented that the vinaya school was not flourishing. Devoting his utmost effort to investigation, he said: "Precepts value teacher-to-teacher transmission. Though I study diligently, what can I do without teacher transmission?" Thereupon he went to Kasuga Shrine and for seven days and nights earnestly prayed. On the evening when the period was fulfilled, he dreamed that pure water flowed through copper conduits from Tōshōdai Temple to Nakagawa. Upon awakening he considered this a good sign. The next day he went to Tōshōdai and saw the temple buildings in decay and the monks scattered. One remaining monk was plowing in the fields. The master asked: "Where is the true master's portrait hall?" The monk pointed to the place. The master said: "Why are there no monks?" The monk said: "Though I am unworthy, I once listened to the *Dharmaguptaka Precept Text*." The master was greatly pleased. He then went to the portrait hall and begged to receive transmission. Soon he returned to Nakagawa Temple. There was no major or minor vinaya text he did not thoroughly comprehend. Thereupon he greatly opened lecture halls and his reputation spread like wind. Aspiring monks came flocking back. From this time the precept dharma was revived in the world. Initially the master was at Mount Niniku. Through the occasion of picking flowers he came to Nakagawa and saw the wondrous excellence of the environment. He then petitioned the government to build a temple complex, called Jōshin-in. Later he moved to reside at Mount Kōmyō where he ended his days. He once composed *Essential Principles of the Great Teaching* in seven volumes. Dharma Master Jōkei greatly praised it. There was also *Precept Platform

Procedures* in one volume.

**Praise says:** The dharma of receiving full ordination has roughly two types. One is called "universal reception." If there are no good precept masters, one can obtain self-vowed reception. One is called "specific reception." One must receive from others. With complete conditions and proper procedures, only when each step follows dharma is ultimate completion achieved. If there is even partial transgression, it cannot be called receiving full ordination. Now Master Ban generally did not transmit the seal of specific precept reception, but begged to receive transmission from the remaining monk at Tōshōdai. His aspiration is truly admirable. However, if his teacher-monk was not in accordance with dharma, one cannot be without doubt. Someone said: The *Five Hundred Questions* states: "If the teacher-monks on the platform wear lay clothes or violate prohibitive precepts, if the precept recipient does not know this is unlawful, it is obtained; if they know, it is not obtained." Thinking from this, regarding Master Ban's reception occasion, it can be observed from this corner. Though this is not ordinary teaching, it also has basis. Masters of clear vinaya and high virtue need further evaluation.

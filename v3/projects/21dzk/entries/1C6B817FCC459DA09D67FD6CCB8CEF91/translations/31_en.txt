[the Master] to Chengming Palace. The Master performed the ritual of a disciple and received the bodhisattva precepts. The imperial bestowals were abundant and magnificent, but the Master donated them all to Bodhisattva Temple to fund construction work. During the Kaiyuan era he showed slight illness and admonished his disciples saying: "My karmic connections are fulfilled here. You must firmly uphold precept conduct and not allow laxity." Having finished speaking, he passed away peacefully. His lifespan is not recorded in detail.

**Tang Dynasty Master Fashen of Longxing Temple in Yangzhou Biography**
The Vinaya Master's name was Fashen. He was a son of the Guo clan of Jiangdu. In his infant years he aspired to the dharma of the Empty King, and his parents could not dissuade him. He finally severed his attachments and left home. In the fourth year of Sisheng he received full ordination from Master Cheng of Yaotai. He was twenty-two years old at the time. He studied Vinaya at the Eastern Pagoda of Dayuan Temple, practicing morning and evening to penetrate its subtle principles. Worthies of the time competed to praise him. He became renowned throughout the capital region. Monks of various temples requested the Master to serve as their leader, but he declined all such positions. He departed and went to Yangdu. The Master moved the entire age with his virtue, literary talent, and eloquence. Scholars from the four directions gathered at his gate. Even high ministers and officials all humbly wished to meet him. Those who received his gracious reception were like withered seedlings receiving rain. When the Master spoke with people's children, he relied on filial piety; when speaking with subjects, he relied on loyalty; when speaking with superiors, he relied on benevolence; when speaking with inferiors, he

relied on ritual propriety. He observed the times and adapted appropriately, responding to circumstances and beings like a wish-fulfilling jewel without fixed color. Imperial Secretary Lu Cangyong, who was highly talented and prestigious and did not easily defer to others, became reluctant to leave after meeting the Master once. He withdrew and sighed: "I never imagined there could be such an elder in the universe." He then built a Vairocana Treasure Repository in the temple courtyard, storing sutras within it and adorning it with incense and lamps. The Master sharpened his practice and diligently applied himself, daily reciting the Diamond Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra. In heat he would not seek coolness, his food was insufficient, and he would not change his sitting position. Whatever donations he received, he kept not even a hair's worth, distributing it all to the great assembly. One day at the separate courtyard of Longxing Temple, he rose at dawn, performed ablutions, sat cross-legged on a rope bed, and focused his mindfulness on the Western [Pure Land]. At the time of evening he passed away serenely. This was actually the fourteenth day of the tenth month in the seventh year of Tianbao. He lived eighty-three years with sixty-two years in the dharma. When the news reached all directions, black-robed and white-robed [clergy and laity] mourned for him. His disciples carried his entire body and built a stupa on Shugang Plain west of Wucheng. Those who attended the funeral numbered about ten thousand. The four-fold disciples he had converted numbered one thousand. His foremost dharma successors included Huaiyi of Minchuan, Chongrui of Nankang, Yixuan of Jinling, Huiluan of Tanshan, Fayu of Luojing, Fali of Helin, Huining of Weiyang, Lingyi of Yifeng, and others. In the twelfth month of the eighth year of Dali, his followers requested Li Hua, Assistant Director of the Personnel Department from Zhaojun, to compose a stele inscription commemorating his virtue.

**Tang Dynasty Master Xuanyan of Fahua Temple in Yuezhou Biography**
The Vinaya Master's name was Xuanyan. His secular surname was Xu. In youth he was intelligent and bright, his outstanding development surpassed his peers. At the age of twelve he took leave of his parents and served under Monk Huan of Fuchun. In the first year of Zhengsheng, through imperial grace allowing ordinations, he first joined the monastic ranks. He resided at Xianliu Temple. His bearing was lofty and upright, his demeanor dignified and awe-inspiring. Upon reaching adulthood he received full precepts from Master Dao'an of Guangzhou. Subsequently he traveled to the capital and explored the profound mysteries of vinaya standards. At that time the two great elders Manyi and Rongji each established vinaya banners in their regions with flourishing transformative influence. The Master consulted with each one by one, his inquiries reaching ever further. The two elders gave him their seal of approval. Through this his reputation arose like surging water and emerging mountains. After a long time he returned to the Yangzi region and greatly promoted the Dharmaguptaka [Vinaya]. Before this, Dao'an had a dream during a nap in which a divine monk told him: "Xuanyan will become a great dharma vessel. He should be taught with Mahāyāna." Upon awakening he instructed the Master to study the Diamond Prajñāpāramitā. The Master applied concentrated effort and deep contemplation, profoundly comprehending its subtle principles. He consequently composed *Meaning Commentary in Seven Volumes*, revealing what ancient masters had not yet revealed. In Yuezhou there was a hermitage called Fahua. Formerly the monk Tanyi had built a hut on the mountain peak, entered this dharma samādhi, and received inspiration from Samantabhadra Bodhisattva at this place. The Master built a precept platform here and greatly promoted the school's teachings. In the twenty-fourth year of Kaiyuan, the Emperor personally annotated the Diamond Prajñāpāramitā and issued an edict summoning famous monks throughout the realm to expound it. The Master was among them. When his magnificent voice resounded once, listeners were awakened with alarm. Famous ministers and high officials of the time - such as Xu Jiao, Governor of Luozhou; Xu Anzheng, Minister of Public Works; Qi Han, Governor of Runzhou; and Wang Bi, Governor of Sizhou - all received his dharma instructions. Minister Qi's reverent faith was particularly profound. He invited the Master to Danyang, Yuhang, Wuxing and other prefectures to confer full precepts on newly ordained monks. From Guangling to Xin'an, over a

thousand-li territory, black-robed and white-robed people who received precepts numbered nearly ten thousand. On the third day of the eleventh month in the first year of Tianbao he contracted slight illness. By noon on the seventh day he ascended his rope bed and suddenly passed away while sitting. His worldly age was sixty-eight with forty-nine years of monastic life. He had over three thousand disciples. His foremost successors were: Tanjun of Fahua, Weizhan of a certain temple, Chongyi of Longxing, Zhifu of Kaiyuan, Shenyong of a certain temple, Xiangyan of Chongyi, Chongxiao of a certain temple, Hongpei of Baolin, Daozhao of a certain temple, and others. The Master performed prostrations to the Buddha Name Sutra one hundred times, lectured on the Diamond Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra one hundred sessions, and held ten great unrestricted assemblies. He once restored the stone Buddha of Shan County to extreme magnificence, its gold and blue brilliance illuminating the forest peaks. His writings include *Three Sections of Karma Commentary* and *Supplementary Record to the Practice Manual in Ten Volumes*. The Master was also one of the sixty schools. Fifteen years after his death, Wan Qirong composed a stele inscription to honor his virtue.

The eulogy says: In the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom it asks: "If a bodhisattva dwells in true reality and attains no dharma, can they break precepts?" It answers: "Because they dwell in true reality, they do not even create merit, how much less would they create sin?" Now observing Master Yan, he devoted his heart completely to prajñā while being able to discipline his body with vinaya. He was one who deeply attained the perfection of wisdom. Compared to those who harm phenomena through principle, harm principle through phenomena, diverging from the source of one flavor and creating the defilement of dualistic views - the difference is as vast as heaven and earth.

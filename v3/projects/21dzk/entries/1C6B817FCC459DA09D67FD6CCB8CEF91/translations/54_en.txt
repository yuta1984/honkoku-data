[Dharma] compare to one whose mouth speaks of purity while the heart clings to saṃsāra? However, if those who cultivate Pure [Land] practice learn from his vow-making, that would be good. But embracing stones to throw oneself into water, or piling up firewood to burn one's body—I do not see the appropriateness of this.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Miaosheng, Song**
The vinaya master was named Miaosheng; history does not record his surname. He was from Kuaiji. He left home, received ordination, and studied the vinaya. Together with Chan Master Datong Ben, he resided at Xiangwu Temple on Chaoshan and jointly practiced Pure Land cultivation. One evening he gathered his disciples, chanted the *Amitābha Sutra*, went to his bed and sat upright, burned incense with palms joined, gazed around peacefully and passed away quietly. He has *Illustrations and Corrections of the Six Articles* that circulates in the world. His disciples included Juecheng and several others.

**Praise says:** Master Sheng's lifelong practices and works indeed had praiseworthy aspects. However, regarding the corrections discussed in *Illustrations of the Six Articles*, though there are many critical passages, there are conversely questionable points. Those who clarify the vinaya should examine this carefully.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Weiyue, Song**
The vinaya master was named Weiyue and resided at Huacheng in Zhuji. He was accomplished in vinaya studies and exclusively cultivated Pure [Land] practice. One day an extraordinary monk came to welcome him. Three days later he showed slight illness, and suddenly called to Daoning of the same temple, saying: "Now I see Amitābha Buddha, about eight feet tall, standing in mid-air." Having spoken, he immediately passed away peacefully.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Yuanzhao of Huxin, Song**
Vinaya Master Yuanzhao belonged to the Lu clan of Siming, being of the lineage of the literary figure Lu Dian. In his early years he left home and mastered vinaya studies. He constantly resided at Huxin and recited the *Lotus Sutra* ten thousand times. He once perused the entire Buddhist canon and also shed his blood to

write the *Lotus Sutra* and various vinaya texts. In the fourth year of Jianyan, barbarian troops broke through Siming and next pressed upon the Master's residence. The Master remained calm without any sign of fear. Upon reaching Jingkou, he told those around him: "I shall return west." He immediately recited the Buddha's name while gazing west and passed away. At that time there were sounds of reed-pipes and songs, which all the soldiers and civilians heard together. None failed to be amazed and moved.

**Praise says:** I have observed that among the various masters who cultivated Pure [Land] practice, many experienced auspicious responses when approaching death. As for Master Zhao's ability to depart whenever he wished to go—how rare this is! Jiyin praised Chan Master Shanzhao, saying: "Observing his moment between death and life, it was like merchant barbarians and relay officials—staying when they should stay, going when they should go." I say the same of Master Zhao.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Zhuoan Du, Song**
The vinaya master was named Jiedu with the sobriquet Zhuoan. History does not detail his clan or native place. His natural endowment was strict and severe, his understanding capacity pure and far-reaching. In vinaya studies there was nothing he did not master, and he also studied Tiantai teachings, deeply investigating their profound meanings. In a certain year he used the Great Wisdom's new commentary to lecture on the *Contemplation Sutra* at Huxin. Scholars from all directions were without exception pleased and convinced. Once, Dharma Master Caoan wrote *Auxiliary Correct Explanation* on someone's behalf to challenge the new commentary. Master Zheng of the Huayan [school] wanted to resolve the challenge but did not succeed. One day he visited the Master and said: "Regarding the *Auxiliary Correct [Explanation]*, I am certainly not confused. But I fear that later students might hesitate and doubt. I have long wanted to critique it but have not yet taken up the brush. Master, please fulfill my aspiration." The Master agreed and subsequently composed *Supporting the New Treatise*. His exposition of meaning and establishment of principles were considered most elegant and correct. In his later years he resided at Jile in Yuyao, spreading the teaching's essentials and gaining fame in all four directions. One morning a slight illness arose, and he wrote letters bidding farewell to scholar-officials and

old friends of the Way. He commanded the assembly to recite the *Contemplation Sutra*, and when they reached the contemplation of the Dharma-body, he recited the Buddha's name in a strong voice and passed away in lotus position. His writings include *Correct Contemplation Commentary*, *Hearing and Retention Commentary*, *Supporting the New Treatise*, *Annotated Praise of Amitāyus Buddha*, and several other volumes that are transmitted in the world. He also once composed a harmonizing response to Yuanming's *Returning Home* and wrote a preface saying: "This rustic of Zhuoan was suffering from illness in his forest retreat. One day during a brief respite, I took up Tao Yuanming's *Returning Home* and read it. Without realizing it, I set down the scroll and sighed deeply. It shares the same track as my feelings though from a different era. Yuanming was merely a lay person. Poverty and hardship were not without their pressing urgency. Yet still he made light of five pecks of grain and could not bear to bow his waist before the village children, freeing himself from office and joyfully composing about 'returning home.' How much more so for a son of the Buddha who seeks to leave home for the sake of liberation, yet runs about in the dusty realm without knowing when to stop—would this not be a source of shame before Yuanming? I have always considered the Land of Peace and Nourishment as my native place, and wanting to express my humble feelings for self-encouragement, I have rashly composed this harmonizing response to his lofty verse. I hope readers will not mock this as mere imitation. Each simply expresses their aspiration." Written on the full moon day of late autumn, year Dingyou. The composition says: "Returning home! When shall I turn my head toward my native place and return? Aware of cold coming and heat departing, I toil in dreams and sleep, harboring sadness. Once I casually made this separation; now I regret it but cannot pursue [the remedy]. Looking toward the excellent friends of the lotus pond, I truly bear shame and know my error. Alas, how many lifetimes of drifting—losing the sewn jewel in my inner garment! Turning to deep thought and fierce awakening—how lowly and base my moral discipline! If I wish to return, then simply return—single-mindedly rushing west. Long life without death—the gate of all mysteries. Mind-only is inherently complete, true nature permanently exists. Abandoning and damaging the Zhou tripods, instead recognizing gourd cups. Vainly receiving gifts in magnificent mansions, thereby opposing and rebelling against loving parents. Lamenting the urgency of myriad sufferings, I must leave danger and approach safety. Though there is nowhere inappropriate to go, what about the barriers on the

**Left Page Lower Section**
traveler's road? Entrusting myself to the wondrous realm of [the Pure Land's] twenty-eight [features], entering right concentration for distant contemplation. Suddenly manifesting with complete mind, rejoicing that the pearls of Hepu have returned. Mixing the pure and defiled of dust-mote worlds, wandering according to wherever my feet rest. Returning home! Bidding farewell and cutting off external wandering. Moreover, destroying form and ruining robes—seeking only liberation. Why busily chase after things? Remaining tranquil without considering this worry. Losing the treasures of one's own family, abandoning the ancestral fields. Just facing hunger with no grain, wanting to cross by sinking the boat. Even worse than common folk—this is what one calls a bhikṣu. If one hears righteousness but does not move toward it, why not seek the source and draw from the stream? Illuminating the stillness of myriad conditions, storing away the rest of the six functions. Enough! Human life's transformations are the same as the four seasons; sun and moon at heaven's edge never pause briefly. Not making plans for oneself—where will this lead? Where there is life there must be death; who can promise a hundred years? One should cultivate the inch of mind-field through plowing, frequently tend the love-grass through weeding. Forming the Pure Land Society of Mount Lu, chanting the new poems of Zha Hermitage. Sending heart and thought to the setting sun—suddenly like feathered transformation, certainly without doubt."

**Praise says:** While Vinaya Master Du was assisting and praising his own school, he composed commentaries and wrote treatises, pointing out the paths to the Pure Land, contributing strength to the Great Wisdom lineage—how could this be considered small? I have often observed his *Returning Home* composition—the language is fresh and thoughts far-reaching, the diction clear and principles illuminating. It truly causes people to chant and recite within it without adding the slightest [impure] thought, all placing their bodies in the realm of pure white lotus flowers. This can be called using writing and ink as Buddhist activity.

**Biography of Three Vinaya Masters Weiyi, Fazheng, and Fajiu, Song**
Vinaya Master Weiyi—his surname is unknown. He studied under Vinaya Masters Daobiao and Zhijiao, polishing and refining

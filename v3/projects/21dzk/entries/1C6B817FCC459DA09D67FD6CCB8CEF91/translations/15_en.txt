...the *Vinaya* in eighty-five sections, and over twenty sections on precept essentials and procedural acts of the Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna. His writings include *Commentary on Vinaya Rituals* in twelve volumes, *Commentary on Procedural Acts* in four volumes, and *Commentary on Bodhisattva Precepts* in two volumes. People of the time treasured these secret transmissions like wish-fulfilling jewels. He transmitted precepts to over three thousand monks and nuns. He ordained a certain number of disciples. Seven top disciples received his dharma: Daozhi, Facheng, Huiyan, Huizhi, Baoding, Zhisheng, and Huijue. All were masters who proclaimed the Way in their respective regions. During the Renshou period, Daozhi erected a stele within the temple. Huiri Falun composed the inscription.

Praise says: Mencius said: "Those who subdue people through force do not truly submit in their hearts—their force is insufficient. Those who subdue people through virtue find joy in their hearts and sincere submission." Master Wen uttered one excellent word that caused the ruler to feel impressed and develop faith. Without possessing natural pure virtue, who could achieve such a thing? Alas, did Chen slight the Master and make monks of its people? Observing how he made light of life, valued the Way heavily, and remained unbending in the face of danger, it can be said he practiced what was extremely difficult.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Fayuan of Daxingguo Temple, Bingzhou, Sui Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Fayuan, his lay surname Ren, a person of Xihe. His natural endowments were brilliant and keen, his spiritual wisdom surpassing others. Though in lay form, his conduct and deportment were like a monk's. He came to Yedu for sightseeing and frequented the quarters of Great Controller Fashang at Heshui Temple. They conversed about the profound throughout the day before parting. Fashang loved his demeanor like a lotus emerging from water and immediately had his hair shaved to make him a monk. When he ascended the platform to receive full ordination, he aspired to follow Upāli's footsteps. He comprehensively studied the vinaya sections and exhausted their profound mysteries. For the four vinaya texts transmitted to the East, he composed commentaries on their meanings, wonderfully harmonizing their similarities and differences. During the flourishing time of the Northern Qi,

vinaya students rose like steaming clouds. The Master established positions refuting various schools, and none dared to encounter his sharp edge. He was often esteemed as "the tiger of the vinaya." In a certain year, he received an imperial command to serve as head seat of the two monasteries of the Great Zhuangyan Stone Caves. When Imperial Sui received the mandate, he was again commanded by edict to head Daxingguo Temple in Bingzhou. Imperial favor and courtesy were supremely generous. He was honored at the time. He manifested nirvana auspiciously on the twenty-second day of the sixth month of the seventh year of Kaihuang. He enjoyed a worldly lifespan of sixty-four years. He sat for a certain number of summers. His disciples built a pagoda west of Bing city. His writings include *Commentary on the Four-Part Vinaya* in ten volumes and *Compendium of Right and Wrong* in two volumes. These were widely practiced at the time. His ordained disciples numbered a certain number of people including so-and-so. Those who succeeded to his dharma were called Daoxing, Daokan, and others, again a certain number.

**Biography of the Two Vinaya Masters Daoxing and Daokan of Sui**
The Vinaya Master's name was Daoxing. History has lost record of his surname. His character and disposition were profound and refined, his entry into the Way sincere and solid. He was closely instructed by Vinaya Master Fayuan and abundantly received profound guidance. He expanded the lecture hall and successfully upheld the family tradition. Each time lectures ended, he would join with the other monks to circumambulate Yuan's pagoda, pay respects, and return. Between master and disciple, it can be said this represented the utmost of kindness and the completion of righteousness. Though the Master was advanced in years at eighty, he diligently strove with unwearying effort to bear the dharma and guide disciples.

The Vinaya Master's name was Daokan. It is unknown what country he was from. He entered under Vinaya Master Yuan's tutelage and mastered the subtle mysteries of vinaya. His nature was stern and strict, his personal conduct pure and simple. His understanding and practice were both complete, his reputation brilliant. Among both monastics and laypeople, none failed to esteem and praise him.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Lingzang of Daxingshan Temple, Jingzhao, Sui Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Lingzang, son of the Wang family of Xinfeng in Yongzhou. His perception and bearing were intelligent and keen. In his youth he developed a

mind to transcend the dusty world. Having harmonized with his long-held aspiration, he went to study under Vinaya Master Ying. He had his hair cut and received full ordination. Regarding all the teachings of Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna and the vinayas of various schools, there were none he did not thoroughly master. He was especially proficient in the *Mahāsāṅghika* and also skilled in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Treatise*. His eloquent discrimination was swift and outstanding, seizing the seat and astonishing the assembly. At that time, early in the Zhou, Buddhism was extremely flourishing. Each year people were selected for large-scale ordination of monks and nuns. Because the Master had discernment and judgment, he was commanded by edict to test their practice and learning. In the fourth year of Sui Kaihuang, the capital region suffered severe drought. Emperor Wen led the people to seek food in Luozhou. Previously the emperor had formed a friendship with the Master when both were commoners. At this time he commanded him to accompany him and together propagate sagely transformation. Soon those who turned toward the Master were very numerous. The emperor heard of this and issued a personal edict saying: "This disciple is the son of heaven among laypeople. The Vinaya Master is the son of heaven among religious people. Those who wish to leave lay life may be ordained by the Master." Through this the Master came to ordain people numbering in the tens of thousands. Some who were jealous reported this to the throne. The emperor said: "The Master transforms people toward goodness. I prohibit people from doing evil. Though their traces may differ, their principle is the same. Why speak of this matter at length?" Such was the reverence that reached this level. The emperor also founded Daxingshan Temple, making the Master its founding first patriarch. He then commanded the left and right prime ministers to inquire about his well-being every two days. When he was received in audience at the great palace, he was treated as the Master's equal. When seated they necessarily shared the same couch; when traveling they necessarily shared the same carriage. Through this, all the great ministers and eminent scholars without exception bowed deeply with devoted sincerity. The Master once participated in translation work through selection as an eminent monk. His eloquent tongue was exalted beyond what his contemporaries could match. In the sixth year on a certain day of a certain month, he manifested illness and departed through transformation. His lay lifespan was sixty-eight years. His dharma years are not detailed. He was entombed in the southern suburbs.

Praise says: That ancient emperors bestowed favor on men beyond the world—we certainly do not dare say this never happened. But to reach the point of personally issuing an edict calling someone "son of heaven among religious people" is truly not easy to obtain. Was this not a grand occasion for the religious school?

The Buddha World-Honored One said: "I am the dharma king, sovereign in the dharma." Master Zang nearly approached this ideal.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Dacheng, Style Name Mingfan, of Fengcheng Temple, Jiangzhou, Sui Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's posthumous name was Dacheng, style name Mingfan, a person of Danyang. He was the grandson of General Zhaoyuan and Prefect of Yongjia of the Qi dynasty. His father's surname was Tao, given name Qian, who was General Zhengwei and Magistrate of Shangyu of the Liang dynasty. The Master in his boyhood had an inclination to transcend the dusty world. He went to Master Shi of Chongxuan Temple in Yongjia and cut his hair to become his disciple. His appearance and bearing were remarkably beautiful, his perception and capacity broad and relaxed. The entire assembly called him a divine child. When he ascended to the precept grades, he concentrated on studying the vinaya sections. He was especially proficient in the *Sarvāstivāda*. His wise understanding developed brilliantly, beyond what his peers could match. In the early Datong period, he went out to travel to the capital. At that time Great Vinaya Master Zhiwen resided at Fengcheng with lofty virtue and reputation. The Master went to his quarters to receive instruction. He questioned closely and reflected deeply, working diligently day and night without slackening. There were no inner or outer classics and histories he did not thoroughly understand. Through this his literary repository and teaching guidelines were full within and brilliant without. All the great elders of the capital praised him as "a younger generation to be feared." Each time the Master ascended the hall to expound dharma, he analyzed principles and questioned doubts. His eloquent discrimination was supremely excellent, ranging freely in all directions. Listeners forgot fatigue. Even during lecture breaks he practiced meditation and also performed repentance rituals without fail during the six periods. Suddenly he manifested slight illness. His casual conversation and responses were no different from usual times. For several days he continuously chanted the Buddha's name and departed peacefully. This was actually the fifth day of the fifth month of the nineteenth year of Kaihuang. His wisdom-lifespan was a certain number; his worldly age was sixty-eight. His coffin was kept for three days—his limbs remained soft and warm, his joined palms clearly visible. On the eighth day of that month, his disciples honored his remains and built a pagoda on the southern mountain of Fengcheng Temple. Throughout the Master's life his deportment was dignified and grave, treading carefully and following proper guidelines. Those who saw him felt he was not easy to approach intimately. But when they heard his instructive words, they found them abundantly warm like spring. Thus many people were pleased to follow his teaching. What he obtained...

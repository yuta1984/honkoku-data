[The emperor] consoled him saying: "The preceptor did not fear the perils of whale-waves and arrived directly at this land. Your aspiration is most commendable. I have been constructing Tōdaiji Temple for years already. I constantly wished to establish a precept platform and have monks and nuns receive precepts, but could not accomplish this due to lack of teacher-exemplars. The preceptor has fortunately fulfilled my aspiration. From now on, the duties of conferring precepts and transmitting vinaya I entrust entirely to the preceptor. Soon I shall appoint you as Great Monk Director." In the fourth month of this year, a precept platform was built in front of Rushana Hall. The emperor first ascended the platform and received the great bodhisattva precepts. The empress and crown prince also all participated in the precept ceremony. The great virtuous ones of that time—Reifuku, Kenkei, Shichū, Zenchō, Dōen, Heitoku, Ninki, Zensha, Gyōsen, Gyōnin, and others—those who received full ordination numbered more than five hundred. This was truly the beginning of establishing platforms and conferring full ordination in our country. The master later built the Precept Platform Cloister west of the great hall. He also specially built Tang Chan Cloister several steps north of the cloister to reside in. He expounded vinaya extensively and developed the four assemblies. In the seventh year, second month, the emperor sent an envoy with an imperial message saying: "I wish to build a Buddhist temple to serve permanently as a place for promoting precepts. Master, please construct it." He then granted the mansion of Prince Kaifu Gidō Tanabe. The master tasted the soil and said: "This is auspicious land. It does not differ from the soil taste of Seikyū Precept Platform." He then constructed [the temple] on that land. Before completion, the emperor passed away. Empress Kōken also revered the master's virtue, with especially deep respect and veneration, and bestowed the title Great Preceptor. In the first year of Tenpyō-hōji, wishing to fulfill the former emperor's aspiration, she ordered Minister Fujiwara Takafusa to oversee construction anew. By the eighth month of the third year it was completed. Its design was grand and spacious, with magnificent and splendid ornamentation. The carved eaves and jade beams soared above to touch the sky and clouds; the vermillion doors and curved stone steps below reflected in forests and valleys. Observers thought it was a palace of Brahmā, Indra, dragons and devas manifested in the human world. The master specially established a shrine to Wheel-Canopy Dragon King

to protect the temple. This was because the dragon king had once made a vow to protect the relics. The emperor personally took up brush and ink, wrote the four large characters "Tōshōdai Temple," and hung them at the mountain gate. She also decreed that the master build a precept platform and received the great bodhisattva precepts. Even court nobles and ministers were all able to participate. She also decreed throughout the realm that those leaving household life should first enter Tōshōdai, receive precepts and study vinaya, then afterward study their own sect. By this, monks from all directions harmoniously flocked there. Emperor Awaji, concerned that monastic provisions were insufficient, allocated one thousand acres of fertile fields in Bizen to supply them. In the fourth year, she decreed that the master inaugurate a Brahmajāla Assembly to benefit Emperor Shōmu's posthumous merit. On the last day of the twelfth month of the fifth year, the master happened to visit Mount Katsuragi and heard bell and chime sounds. Following the sound he advanced and suddenly saw a divine person. He asked: "What bell is this?" The deity said: "This is the bell of Bodhisattva Hōki's poṣadha teaching assembly." After a while, Bodhisattva Hōki sat on a jeweled lotus surrounded by various bodhisattvas and conducted poṣadha teaching. The master then participated in that assembly, requested a tally-stick, and returned. That tally-stick remains at Tōshōdai Temple to this day, treasured by his descendants as a temple-protecting treasure. In the sixth year, by imperial decree he built precept platforms at Yakushiji Temple in Shimotsuke and Kanzeonji Temple in Chikuzen. Those seeking precepts increased even more. When the master was formerly in Tang, a Sanskrit monk left him three measures of sacred soil from Jetavana. Therefore, wherever he built precept platforms, he took that soil to plaster them. All their standards were modeled on [Mount] Nanshan. In the seventh year, the master told the assembly: "The sixth day of this midsummer is my end." When the time came he faced west, sat in lotus position, and passed away. This was actually the sixth day of the fifth month of the seventh year of Tenpyō-hōji. He lived seventy-seven years. His monastic age was fifty-five years. When court and commoners heard the death announcement, none were not shocked and lamenting. After three days and nights, his countenance remained bright and lustrous.

When they touched his crown it was still warm. His disciples reverently placed him in a coffin and buried him in the northeast corner of the temple. On this day purple clouds gathered thickly and strange fragrances spread everywhere. The black-robed and white-clothed mourners filled the four crossroads with sounds of wailing. His converted disciples numbered more than forty thousand. Those who inherited his dharma were Hōshin, Ninkan, Hōka, Donjō, Shitaku, Hōsai, Gijō, Hōjō, Chii, Reiyō, Eken, Eun, Nyohō, Eryō, Etatsu, Ejō, Eki, and others. He lectured on the *Fali Commentary* forty times, the *Administrative Extracts* more than seventy times, and the *Karmavācanā Commentary* and *Light and Heavy Ceremonies* ten times each. He hand-copied the Three Piṭakas to protect the temple, held several unrestricted great assemblies, and restored more than eighty monasteries. He also made three thousand kaṣāya robes and distributed them to the monastic communities of various mountains of Wutai. In the first year of Tenpyō-jingo, he was posthumously titled Great Master Who Crossed the Sea. The master's regular miraculous manifestations were extremely numerous: sometimes when teaching dharma, a six-armed bodhisattva would appear in the dharma hall; sometimes when conferring precepts, heaven would rain sweet dew; sometimes when temples lacked water, he would hold his staff and strike rocks causing springs to immediately gush forth; sometimes when building pagodas, he would see relics emit strange light, and divine persons would stand beside the pagoda to assist and protect. Sometimes when repairing ruined temples, vajra spirits would transform into powerful oxen and transport materials to help. Such was the inspiration of his virtue and merit. Initially our country's Tripiṭaka had many scribal errors and corruptions. By imperial decree the master corrected them. When crossing east, miasmic fog harmed his eyesight, but he had memorized most passages of the Tripiṭaka, so he immediately made corrections. Also, regarding various medicines, this land did not know authentic from false, but the master could distinguish them by scent alone without any errors. The master's life events are recorded in detail in the *Eastern Crossing Biography*. Here I merely outline the general points.

**Praise says:** The great master rode on his vows of ancient compassion and emerged from China. Grasping the seal of vinaya, his way was clearly manifest in that time. Once he crossed ten thousand miles of whale-waves and came to transform this land. Initially he erected the victory banner at Tōdaiji, then moved the dharma flag to Tōshōdai. [Residing at] both dharma halls for ten changing seasons, one stream of pure spring irrigated the entire realm. Therefore he became imperial teacher to three courts and repeatedly received imperial favor. Those of that time who heard his name and revered his virtue all turned toward him without exception. Alas! Since Prince Regent of the Upper Palace exercised provisional rule and initiated civilization, when has there not been dharma propagation and way transmission in any generation? One who built precept platforms and conducted karmavācanā, enabling all under heaven to witness the correct standards of vinaya, truly began with the great master. [This achievement] differs in era but equals in merit with Dharmakāla's vinaya transmission. How could this not be praiseworthy? Now more than nine hundred years have passed since the great master, yet his remaining radiance burns brightly, illuminating the vinaya garden without yet fading away. This is because the source is deep and the flow is long. I regret being a late-life, inferior student who did not personally participate in the role of sweeping and cleaning. Whenever I visit Tōshōdai Vinaya Temple and pay respects to his historical traces, I invariably linger, unable to bear leaving. Moved by the present and thinking of the past, I emit sighs of "why not ten thousand years!"

**Biography of Vinaya Master Daoxuan**
The vinaya master's name was Daoxuan. His family name is not detailed. He was Chinese. He thoroughly mastered vinaya and additionally studied the Huayan and Tiantai two schools. He also received the single-transmission teaching from Chan Master Puji. He resided at Dafuxian Temple in the eastern capital, expanding the dharma seat. Our country's Eiei and Fushō, by imperial decree, entered Tang and requested the master to cross eastward. He then embarked on an envoy ship in the twenty-fourth year of Kaiyuan and arrived. He brought many vinaya texts such as the *Administrative Extracts* and Huayan commentaries. Emperor Shōmu decreed that he be lodged at the Western Tang Cloister of Daianji Temple. The master regularly lectured on the *Administrative Extracts* with the assembly, analyzing subtle profundities with eloquent discourse without obstruction. The *Administrative Extracts*

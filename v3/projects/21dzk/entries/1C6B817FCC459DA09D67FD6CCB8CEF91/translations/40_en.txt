His natural disposition was intelligent and keen. With all inner and outer scriptural texts, he understood them upon sight. Knowledgeable people said: "This is a thoroughbred horse of the monastic community." Subsequently he received full ordination from Vinaya Master Jiandao Zhi at the Tianzhu Ordination Platform in Zheyang. He returned to serve and study under Master Yi. He studied the Abhidharma commentaries together with the Nanshan Commentaries, understanding all thoroughly without regret. Moreover, he excelled at literary composition. When he composed poetry he would exclusively gain the praise of his time. Once he had a slight disagreement with Master Yi, left him and traveled extensively. After visiting dharma assemblies everywhere, he reproached himself saying: "Having traveled half the world, those like my original master are rare." He then returned to Master Yi's place. When the monks were assembled, he carried thorns on his back and declared: "This person again takes refuge with the Master. I only pray for acceptance." Master Yi scolded him endlessly. The Master shed tears in confession and repentance, saying: "My previous thoughts were ignorant. My later mind has awakening. I hope the Master's great compassion will bestow joy upon me." He pleaded pitifully repeatedly. Master Yi took pity on him and thus reestablished their teacher-student relationship as before. After Master Yi passed away, he visited National Teacher Zhong of Nanyang and secretly received transmission of the essential teachings. Chan Master Hong of Yunqi placed the Master under the section of Venerable Master's Conduct in his *Record of Exalted Conduct* and therefore composed a eulogy. I now record this together.

The eulogy says: "Abandoning sages and realizing error, facing harsh words without retreat - this can be called clear and sincere. Finally receiving transmission of the mind-seal - was this without reason? Those of shallow faith, with small dislikes depart for long without returning; with slight rebuke they harbor resentment and do not forget. Having met enlightened teachers in vain, what benefit could there ultimately be? Like meeting an emperor but gaining no office - how regrettable!"

At twenty-two he received full ordination from Great Master Dayuan of Nanyue. He investigated the subtle flavors of vinaya and wonderfully entered the profound and mysterious. During the Dali period he was affiliated with Jingyun Temple. He lectured and chanted the Four-Part Vinaya and the Nanshan Vinaya Commentaries. At the beginning of Zhenyuan he moved to reside at Longxing Temple in Yuzhang. Those who associated with the Master were all dragons and elephants of the dharma community, such as Fazhen of Mount Lu, Lingyou of Tiantai, Fayi of Jingmen, Shencou of Xingguo, Huijin of Jianchang, and others. Even renowned scholars of the time like Prime Minister Duke Jiang Gongfu, Duke Yan Zhenqing of Lu, Yang Ping, and Wei Dan also delighted in associating with the Master. On a certain day in the eleventh month of the tenth year of Yuanhe, he passed away at Donglin Hermitage on Mount Lu. He lived in the world seventy-seven years and resided peacefully for fifty-five summer retreats. His complete body was interred at the stone tomb on Nangang and a pagoda was built. The disciples he ordained numbered over 15,500. His foremost dharma heirs were Daoshen, Huaizong, Rujian, Chongqi and others - twenty in total. Secretariat Drafter Bai Juyi composed the stone pagoda inscription.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Yuan Chengche of Yunmen Temple in Kuaiji**
The Vinaya Master's taboo name was Lingche. His courtesy name was Yuan Cheng. His surname was Tang. He was from Yuezhou. His natural endowment was pure and good, refined and detached from the mundane. After tonsure and receiving ordination, he thoroughly studied the Tripitaka. His observance of precepts was orderly and strict. Initially residing at Yunmen Temple in Kuaiji, he taught through vinaya instruction. Those who came to study with him were like those flocking to markets. The Master used brush and ink to expound the ultimate truth, producing elegant verses like thousands of blossoms competing in bloom, brocade beauty spreading like sunset clouds, yet without seeing traces of spring wind's gentle nurturing. Therefore scholars of the time who came to his gate, such as Liu Changqing, Yan Wei, Huangfu Ceng and others, all wished to befriend the Master, together composing and responding to each other in the realm of wind, moon, and tranquility. His fame blazed forth and spread to all four corners. Once while traveling to Zhushan in Wuxing, Master Jiaoran saw the Master's bearing at first sight and especially became his friend despite their age difference,

Each composing and chanting, unaware of the evening sun setting behind the trees. Jiaoran wrote to Supervisor Bao praising the Master's virtue and talent. The essence said: "Master Che has a poem on returning to southern Hunan that goes: 'By mountains and waters awaiting bright moonlight, briefly heading toward the human realm to borrow a path. Now returning again toward the mountainside, only lake waters exist with no traveled roads.' All this elder's works are wonderful, but this single piece alone makes this old monk wish to abandon brush and inkstone. His steadfast heart and upright character cannot be easily found. His practice of the Way and empty wisdom need not be ashamed before the likes of Dao'an and Huiyuan," and so forth. Through this, Master Bao treated the Master very generously. Also, Quan Deshan sent a letter asking about the Master to Master Jiaoran. Jiaoran's reply was like the previous letter. During the Zhenyuan period, he traveled west to the capital, his fame resonating throughout the imperial city. The monastic community became jealous of him, spreading rumors and slander. They spoke to court eunuchs and banished the Master to Tingzhou. The Master composed poetry to express his feelings, peacefully maintaining the Way. Subsequently he entered Kuaiji and returned to Eastern Yue. At that time the feudal lords of the Wu-Chu region respectfully invited him with ceremonial propriety. In the eleventh year of Yuanhe he passed away at Kaiyuan Temple in Xuanzhou. Liu Zongyuan composed a poem mourning him. His disciples respectfully interred his complete body, building a pagoda at the foot of Tianzhu Peak in Shanyin of Yue. He lived seventy-one years with [several] years of monastic age. The disciples he ordained included Xiufeng and [several] others. The Master once authored *Record of Sources for Vinaya Commentary Citations* in twenty-one volumes, which was treasured by scholars. He also had a *Literary Collection* in twenty volumes. Minister Liu Yuxi wrote a preface for it. Song Dynasty Chan Master Song of Mingjiao, admiring the Master's style, composed a poem saying: "Master Che's purity was like ice and snow, a high monk whose natural endowment differed from others. At thirty he could compose poetry and his fame had already emerged, his name among poets but his heart in vinaya. Not different from Huiyuan, different from Huixiu, Jiaoran had not yet met - who could be his peer? White clouds scattered freely with no fixed dwelling, suddenly entering the capital region to visit Bao and Li. Solitary purity difficult to maintain, becoming what the masses

obstructed. In the end, blameless yet caught in slanderous words. When trees excel in the forest, wind will surely destroy them; Master Che harboring virtue became a source of calamity. The ancients have passed away with no further sighing, for you I compose this poem to leave for posterity." Such was how later worthies mourned and admired him.

The eulogy says: "I have heard that those with virtue necessarily have words [to express it]. Those with virtue indeed accumulate harmony and compliance within, while brilliance and splendor manifest outward. Nothing they say is not natural expression, not waiting for forced effort to achieve completion. One like Master Che, through his virtue being established as vast, deep, upright and great, when this appeared in his words, naturally became bright and outstanding. This cannot be compared to those who do not cultivate the root but imitate the branches, exhausting their essence in deliberate polishing. Alas! The Master was truly a refined high monk of his generation. How regrettable that his solitary purity was difficult to maintain and he was resented by the masses, ultimately being exiled without cause. Even so, the Master always condensed through the Way, viewing glory, decline, fortune and misfortune no differently than flying dust passing before the eyes. How could there be any inner disturbance?"

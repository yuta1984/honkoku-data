The Master accepted them. When he finished speaking, [the old man] disappeared. Thereupon [the Master] placed the pearls at the center of the platform, and they frequently manifested luminous signs. Thereafter, sometimes they showed golden Buddhas, sometimes six-armed Avalokiteśvara, sometimes kalaviṅka birds, sometimes purple bamboo and jade willows with extraordinary trees and strange stones. Such spiritual wonders were beyond counting. All who saw or heard of them considered them rare phenomena. In a certain year when the empire suffered great drought, Lord Pang Shugu requested the Master to pray for rain. When the Master established an altar and performed repentance rituals, before he had even finished speaking, thunder crashed and rain poured down. The Lord rejoiced, saying: "My family has not served the Buddha for several generations, but now having encountered my teacher, I cannot help but take refuge." Chan Master Zongben of Jingci greatly propagated the Way from the West [Chan Buddhism], attracting monastics from throughout the empire. The Master's friendship with this Chan master was especially close, and he presented him with cloth three robes and a clay begging bowl. The Chan master accepted them and honored them throughout his life, using the bowl for eating and wearing the robes when teaching the Dharma—this showed his reverence for the Master. The Master's bearing was like that of a king, his dignity overwhelming ten thousand monks in its grandeur. His heart was straight and his speech direct; he would not bend to accommodate contemporary customs. When people sometimes slandered him, upon hearing this the Master would privately reflect: "If what they say is indeed correct, I should reform my faults—they are then my teachers. If what they say is indeed wrong, they are merely acting in vain. How could they defile me?" His personal conduct was pure and clean—three robes and one bowl, with no superfluous possessions in his bag. He viewed worldly fame and profit like the transformations of white clouds and gray dogs, never allowing them to occupy his mind. His compassionate heart was deep, and he delighted in beneficial relief. In pursuing blessings and dispelling disasters, he responded like an echo in a valley. He constantly wore cloth monastic robes, carried his staff and bowl, and begged for food in the marketplace, saying: "The former Buddhas made begging for food their practice—why should followers of Śākyamuni be ashamed of this?" Yang Wuwei sighed: "Carrying the bowl out, carrying the bowl back—showing people that one constantly abides in the four deportments. When following the Buddha into the marketplace, though unrecognized, surely ghosts and spirits in the void must know." The Master considered the Pure Land Dharma gate to be the

direct path of cultivation. He focused his mindfulness on the Western [Pure Land], practicing the six-period walking meditation with virtually no empty days. He constantly told his disciples: "In life propagate the vinaya standards; in death return to the Land of Peace and Nourishment. What I have gained in this lifetime consists solely of these two Dharma gates. Other compositions follow my personal preferences." He also said: "For transforming the present age, nothing equals lecturing and teaching; for transmitting to future generations, nothing surpasses writing books." Thus he used the perfect meaning of the Lotus's revelation to provide commentary on the Three Great Works, elucidating Nanshan's original intention while harmonizing with the Buddha's regulations from above. From this point on, the works of various schools seemed as if unheard of. The Master served as abbot of famous monasteries including Fahui, Dabei, Xiangfu, Jietan, Jingtu, Baoge, Lingzhi, and Chongfu for thirty years. Under his teaching seat, outstanding disciples consistently numbered three thousand. Wherever he resided, he invariably established boundaries [for ordination], promoted vinaya teachings, and expounded ancestral instructions. Like dense clouds spreading widely and sweet rain frequently pouring, regardless of monastic or lay, noble or humble status, all received Dharma benefits according to their spiritual capacity. One day he showed slight illness and knew himself that he would not recover. He gathered the assembly to teach the Dharma, and at the end instructed his disciples to chant the *Contemplation Sutra* and the *Samantabhadra's Vows*. He left his pillow and raised his head as if seeing something. Suddenly he sat up in lotus position, spoke a verse, and passed away. Fishermen on the lake heard heavenly music. This was actually the first day of the ninth month in the sixth year of Zhenghe. He lived sixty-nine years from his parents' birth, fifty-one summers in the bodhisattva stage. His disciples honored his complete body and buried it in the northwest corner of the temple. The Master conferred bodhisattva precepts in nearly ten thousand assemblies, and held sixty assemblies for additional precepts and monastic ordination. His monastic and lay disciples were countless. His chief Dharma successors included Daobiao, Zhijiao, Yongqin, Shouqing, Daoyan, Simin, Ze'an, and over fifty others. His writings include the *Zichi Commentary on the Handbook*, *Xingzong Commentary on the Precept Commentary*, *Jiyuan Commentary on the Karma Commentary*, *Yingfa Commentary*, *Zhufa Commentary*, *Bao'en Commentary*, *Contemplation of Infinite Life Sutra Commentary*, *Amitābha Sutra Commentary*, *Revised Bhikṣuṇī*

*Precept Text*, *Ritual for Conferring Bodhisattva Precepts*, probably over a hundred fascicles in total, all published in the world. There is also the *Zhiyuan Collection* in twenty fascicles. Those who have interpreted the *Handbook* number sixty people from Daci to the Master, but the Master, though appearing later, was particularly outstanding. His posthumous title was "Great Wisdom Vinaya Master," and his pagoda was called "Precept Light." Liu Dao composed its inscription, and Grand Preceptor Prince Shi of Yue inscribed its stele reverse, saying: "Confucians are bound by Confucianism, vinaya [masters] are bound by vinaya—this is the great disease of scholars. Only the Master, with three thousand deportments and eighty thousand detailed practices complete and flawless, constantly transcended beyond concentration and wisdom. [He was] a true prince of the Dharma within the Vinaya Piṭaka. Therefore he could arise after several hundred years and directly compare shoulders with Nanshan, his achievements actually surpassing him," and so forth.

**Praise says:** The Great Wisdom Vinaya Master possessed a vast heart and great capacity, profound learning and heroic talent. His sectarian insight shone as brightly as sun and moon, his eloquent debate flowed like the Three Gorges. Therefore he repeatedly occupied teaching platforms, erected supreme banners, turned the great earth's Dharma wheel, and became the leader of vinaya groves in all ten directions. Moreover, wielding a heaven-filling brush, he composed commentaries on the Three Great Works, providing structure to Nanshan [Daoxuan's works], which relied on him for renewed manifestation. This was almost equivalent to Jingxi assisting Tiantai and Qingliang supporting Xianshou—equal in merit and comparable in virtue. Since the existence of vinaya teachings, Nanshan gathered their great completion. Since the existence of Nanshan, the Master was the one who gathered that great completion. From his passing to now, over five hundred years have passed, yet his final instructions remain unworn. Each time one reads them, it is like receiving instruction face to face and ear to ear, still sufficient to enlighten the dark and obscured—how much more so for those who personally received his teaching in that day? Thinking of this, one's spirit soars.

**Biography of Two Vinaya Masters Daobiao and Zhijiao, Song**
The two vinaya masters Daobiao and Zhijiao—their surnames, given names, and native places are unknown. They received the Dharma from Lingzhi Great Wisdom

**Left Page Lower Section**
Vinaya Master. Their natural disposition was outstanding and special. They devoted themselves to the three studies [precepts, concentration, wisdom] and were especially skilled in the Vinaya Piṭaka. Biao once wrote *Establishing Topic Standards and Meanings for the Zichi [Commentary]*, which circulated in vinaya circles. He was called "Buddha Wisdom Master" and his residence was called "Cloud-Touching Hall." Jiao opened the Dharma at Kaiyuan Monastery and became an object of respect and admiration for scholars. The details of both their deaths are unknown.

**Praise says:** The two masters Biao and Jiao were both called "true sons of Great Wisdom." Therefore their words and conduct must have contained much worth transmitting. Is it not regrettable that there are no biographical records or chronicles to examine?

**Biography of Vinaya Master Simin, Song**
Vinaya Master Simin—history does not record the beginning of his leaving home and shaving his head. He followed the Great Wisdom Vinaya Master to receive additional precepts and devoted himself exclusively to Pure [Land] practice for twenty years. One day he showed slight illness and requested the assembly to chant the *Contemplation Sutra* for half a month. After three days he saw transformation Buddhas filling the void. At the moment of death his Buddha-recitation voice rose above the assembly. His body remained in the shrine for seven days. Though it was the height of summer, his form did not change, and extraordinary fragrance richly filled the room. This was verification of superior-grade birth [in the Pure Land].

**Praise says:** Someone asked: "Can we hear an explanation of additional precepts?" I answer: "In receiving precepts there are three grades of intention. Seeking only to escape suffering and exclusively pursuing self-benefit is the inferior grade intention. Resolving doubts for others' sake and benefiting both self and others is the middle grade intention. Forgetting oneself to benefit living beings, cultivating both merit and wisdom, understanding one's fundamental nature and seeking Buddha's enlightenment is the superior grade intention. If at initial reception one generated middle or inferior intention, then in re-receiving one truly obtains appropriateness. This is what is called 'additional precepts.' Alas! The precept essence is the source-beginning of returning the flow [of samsara] and the guide for generating practice. If one does not understand this essence, even if one maintains [precepts] like ice and frost, one is poorly called a bhikṣu. Therefore Zhiyuan of Zhiyuan doubted whether he had truly obtained [proper ordination]

I take up the brush to compile this record. Indeed, the scholarly path of National Master Gyōnen's vinaya virtue lies considerably in the fundamental methods. Therefore, to make known the lineage chart, I now examine ancient manuscripts and records and write this out. The forms of the ancestral masters' names are exceedingly numerous. However, what the school branches use generally does not exceed this. If later scholars find errors, they should make new corrections. My poor calligraphy and inelegant writing bring shame before others' eyes. This should never be disclosed publicly. I only pray that through the merit of compiling this draft, it may serve as a means for eliminating sins and generating good.
The moon of the three bodies shines brightly in the palace of true suchness, and the flowers of the seven treasures on the platform of true characteristics become ever more vivid.

**Section on the Origin of the Sacred Relics' Appearance at the Golden Pagoda of the Ordination Platform**
On the 14th day of the 3rd month of Kōji 2 (1276), year of the Fire Rat, at the hour of the Cock, Buddha relics were excavated from the site of Tōzenji temple.

Generally speaking, Tōzenji was the former site of Master Ganjin, a sacred ground of this temple's foundation. However, after its decline, for many years there were no traces of the monastery, and secular houses lined up under the eaves. At this time, when Monk Superintendent Jōshin was in charge of temple affairs, he demolished numerous dwellings and constructed a single Buddhist hall. Later, regarding this Buddhist hall, the current fundraising monk Saikō Shōnin (Renjisubō), who was promoting the construction of Tōdaiji's stone platform, frequently made great vows for reconstruction. First, to create the surrounding earthen walls, he encouraged the local people to clear away thorns and brambles. In the northwest corner, there was a large mound. When they had it excavated to level the ground, a white crystal jar was dug up from the base of the wall. (About 3 inches in diameter. It struck the hoe and broke into three pieces. However, the Buddha relics had gathered together into three round lumps like chestnut cakes, with a few scattered about.) At that time, monk Chūdō and Shōzen rushed from Shingon-in to that site and reverently placed the Buddha relics in an incense box.

These Buddha relics were distributed by King Vikramāditya in India. A brahmin monk brought 5,000 grains to Daimyōji temple in Yangzhou, Tang China, and presented them to Master Ganjin. Of these, 2,000 grains were enshrined in the pagoda of Daiunji temple, and 3,000 grains were brought by the master. 1,000 grains went to Shōdaiji temple, 1,000 grains to Emperor Shōmu, and 1,000 grains were enshrined at Tōzenji.

The details are in the Record of Sacred Relic Miracles. The miracle record consists of about one volume of over 60 pages.

**Preface to the Biographies of Monastic Treasures of the Vinaya Garden**

Tang Minister Zheng Weizhong once asked Liu Zhixuan: "Why are there many literati from ancient times but few with historical talent?" He replied: "History has three excellences: talent, learning, and insight. The world rarely combines all three, hence historical talent is scarce." Even in the Middle Kingdom, a land of literary refinement, court scholars and famous literati are as numerous as cartloads and measures of grain, yet when it comes to historical talent, it is still rare to find all qualities combined. How much more so in our country?

Master Kaisan of Anyōji temple in the eastern lakes region, Monk Kenjō, entered the Buddhist order in his youth and transcended the dusty world. His character is pure and his learning broad; his insight far-reaching and his talent heroic. He thoroughly understands past and present and practices both doctrinal and meditation schools. He is truly a literary phoenix of the Buddhist gate, a great whale of the Dharma ocean. In recent years, during his leisurely retirement, he compiled the "Biographies of Monastic Treasures of the Vinaya Garden" in fifteen volumes, containing over 300 individuals. He also composed eulogies for them. From the western and eastern regions down to our mulberry fields, he has gathered virtually all the noble conduct and excellent words of the vinaya school's eminent virtuous masters. His writing is straightforward yet concise, his accounts accurate yet detailed. It truly deserves to be called the monastic history of one generation of the vinaya school.

I believe that the vinaya section was personally proclaimed by the Tathāgata's golden mouth, and after his passing, Venerable Upāli compiled it, with the holy assembly repeatedly producing verses. Through this, sage teachers and great virtuous masters widely propagated it in the world. Each generation has had such people. They are truly wisdom lamps illuminating the world, precious rafts for crossing the river. Therefore, the Buddha said: "You monks, after my passing, should respectfully treasure and revere the Prātimokṣa. It is like encountering light in darkness, like a poor person obtaining treasure. You should know that this is your great teacher. Even if I were to remain in the world, it would be no different from this."

Given the Tathāgata's earnest entrustment and instructional words, Master Kenjō has already followed and practiced them, bringing no shame to being a follower of Nanshan. Moreover, examining the complete work he compiled, it is not merely that his literary talent is outstanding, but especially praiseworthy is his long-held aspiration to support the school. This is admirable. Recently he requested a preface from me, and I could not decline. I secretly think that seeing good and not praising it is not the way of a gentleman. Therefore, I describe its general outline at the beginning of the volume, hoping that those foolish and mediocre idlers who improperly mix among the monastic community without cultivating precept-virtue or establishing proper conduct might know to take warning.

Written in the 5th year of Jōkyō, year of the Earth Dragon (1688), on the full moon day of mid-spring, by the Dharma-heir monk Nangen of China, in the Tentoku hermitage.

Praise says: Master Xing entered directly into the midst of chaotic bandits, risking his life to save his mother. At that moment, he only had eyes for his parent and initially did not realize the life-and-death danger involved. In the past, when Jiang Ge encountered rebellion and fled carrying his mother to escape disaster, bandits wanted to take her away. Ge wept and said: "I have an aged mother." The bandits could not bear to harm them. Alas! Master Xing resembled him in being absolutely devoted. As for sensing divine light in his room and dispelling demonic clouds at his words - this was not merely being devoted to his parent, but his mind truly according with the Great Way. The sūtra says: "That which causes me to quickly achieve the supreme true Way comes from filial virtue." How could this not be believed? Someone said: "Touching and grasping treasures is strictly prohibited by the Tathāgata. Master Xing's declining gold and not grasping it is commendable. But his carrying his mother - wouldn't this rather violate the sage's regulations?" I replied: "The *Daśabhāṇavāra Vinaya* states: 'If one rescues mothers, daughters, sisters from illness, water, fire, weapons, deep pits, or dangerous beasts, there is no violation.' Please have no doubts about this."

**Biography of Vinaya Master Xuansu Min of Tongxuan Temple, Suzhou, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's posthumous name was Huimin, courtesy name Xuansu, from Hedong. History has lost record of his family name. His will and conduct were upright and pure, his cleverness and wisdom transcendent. His sincere compassion and loving-kindness came from his natural disposition. At nine he left the dusty world and devoted himself to pure practices. He could recite the *Lotus Sūtra*. At barely fifteen, he followed Master Guangfa from Silla at Fahuixiang Temple to study the *Satyasiddhi Treatise*. His wisdom and understanding were clearly manifested, his eloquence quick and sharp - none could defeat him. The Dharma Master ordered him to share the lecture seat and expound the Dharma. Every listener was amazed, moved, and raised their voices in praise. At seventeen, he went to Guangxing Temple in Haiyan and responded to requests to lecture on the *Lotus Sūtra*. There were often auspicious signs of extraordinary fragrance filling the air. At that time, students from all directions gathered like ants - it reached the point where there was no room to sit. After full ordination, he followed Vinaya Master Zhi at Zhuyuan Temple, mastering the

*Daśabhāṇavāra* and studying various other sections. Before long, Zhi passed away. After the funeral was completed, he departed and entered Kuaiji, paying homage to the stone Buddha at Shan. Soon he traveled to the lecture halls of Tiantai. Shortly after, he resided at Tongxuan Temple in Wu, not stepping beyond the threshold for seventeen years. In daily life he wore coarse clothing and ate rough food. Daily he practiced vigorously with his disciples. When Wu encountered a year of famine, monastics and laypeople all fled in different directions. The Master remained steadfast in meditation and chanting. Suzhou Governor-General Wen Sian heard of the Master's virtuous reputation and requested him to emerge into a famous monastery. The Master firmly did not wish to go. Messengers went back and forth repeatedly before he finally responded. Prefects Li Lian, Xue Tong, Wang Rong and others received the Master's transformative teaching and their reverent faith was especially deep. When the Master grew weary of receiving visitors, he withdrew to Mount Huating Gugan. After practicing the Way there for several years, because the ground was damp and there were many mosquitoes, fearing they might cause harm, he moved to Mount Haiyu. Delighting in its deep tranquility, he dwelt peacefully there for nearly twenty years. Students who came to inquire about the Way arrived in continuous streams, reaching as many as a thousand people. This was truly a flourishing event for the mountain forests. The Master also built a hermitage by the southern stream as a place for lofty cultivation. Constantly there were two rabbits and one leopard dwelling near his quarters, tame and friendly like companions, without any fear or suspicion. Sometimes spirits would appear and receive refuge and precepts from him. It could be said that his virtuous transformation reached both the visible and invisible realms. Suzhou Governor Duke Li Shijia of Wuyang sent envoys with earnest invitations, but the Master declined and did not go. In the nineteenth year of Zhenguan, Prince Jiang the Prefect performed disciple's rites and requested to receive precept teachings. He presented Dharma robes and famous incense, but the Master declined and would not accept, deferring to other worthies. In the final year of Zhenguan, early in the eighth month, he showed signs of illness. Three days before his death, extraordinary fragrance filled his room. Those around him were puzzled and asked about it. The Master said: "I will always depart someday. Birth and death are human constants. Dwelling in life is like drifting clouds - do not cry foolishly. Each of you should contemplate impermanence and early seek self-liberation.

Funeral and burial rites have established ceremonies in the vinaya. Carefully avoid requesting empty writings from those in position, seeking inscriptions and tablets, creating ornate eulogies to defile me. If you can follow this instruction, what more need I say?" Finally, on the eleventh day of that month he peacefully passed away. He was seventy-seven years old. His monastic years are uncertain. His Dharma-transmitting disciples numbered over twenty people. He gave lectures on sūtras, vinayas, and treatises for many sessions. His writings include *Private Notes on the Daśabhāṇavāra*, *Conduct for Monks and Nuns*, *Karma Procedures for Nuns*, and *Commentary on Bodhisattva Precepts for Monastics and Laypeople*, totaling twenty-one volumes.

Praise says: Ancient monks of transcendent worldliness who dwelt in deep mountains and dense forests, withdrawing from the clamorous world, perfected their inner cultivation and severed worldly concerns. Master Min concealed his light for over forty years, encouraging students in desolate places. Though high officials repeatedly summoned him, his ears were as if he did not hear. He could be called one who pursued pure Way while severing worldly ties. That he would not permit memorial inscriptions at the end shows even more his self-concealment and withdrawal. Alas! The Master's lofty and noble style is sufficient to inspire those caught in the greed and competition of the final Dharma age.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Zhixing of Zhuangyan Temple, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Zhixing, family name Song, from Mingzhou. After receiving ordination and full precepts, he made humility and frugality his work, his vigorous practice firm and clear. Initially he followed Vinaya Master Shou at Hongfu, becoming thoroughly versed in the meaning of the vinaya. His natural disposition was transcendent - he memorized dozens of volumes of sūtras and thousands of lines of essential practice verses. He was respected by his colleagues. Whenever it came time for Dharma debates, his wisdom-sword and eloquent edge were like striking lightning and rushing thunder - none dared oppose him. Later he resided at Zhuangyan Temple, taking the position of *karmadāna*. In severe winter he would climb the tower to strike the bell, until his skin cracked and flesh wrinkled with blood congealing in his palms, yet he never complained of the labor. In the fifth year of Daye, his fellow student monk Sanguo had an elder brother who followed Emperor Yang south to

Jiangdu. He died midway on the journey. He appeared in his wife's dream saying: "I died of illness at Pengcheng. Because I did not maintain fasting and precepts, I fell into hell and suffer indescribably. Thanks to monk Zhixing of Zhuangyan Temple striking the bell, the sound resonated in hell and all who suffered there were liberated simultaneously. Now I have been born in a place of happiness. Thinking to repay his kindness, you should offer ten bolts of silk to express my gratitude." When she awoke and told this, initially no one believed her. Soon she dreamed the same again. After more than ten days, news of the death suddenly arrived, exactly matching the dream. The wife then offered the silk. The Master immediately distributed it among the great assembly. The community asked: "How does striking the bell create such response?" The Master said: "Because I saw the merit of bell sounds in the *付法蔵伝* and *Āgama Sūtras*, I respectfully follow this practice, exerting effort to carry it out. Also, when I begin striking the bell, I make this prayer: 'May all sages and saints enter the assembly hall together,' then slowly strike three times. When making the long strikes, I again pray: 'May all beings in evil destinies simultaneously leave suffering.' That is all - nothing else special. How could I have imagined such small sincerity would create response?" The assembly all expressed great admiration. In the third month of the sixth year of Zhenguan, he fell ill and knew in advance the day of his death. He gave away his material possessions, summoned friends to bid farewell, and on a certain day peacefully passed away. He was forty-five years old, having sat through a certain number of summer retreats. His disciples Shanyin and others, a certain number of people, took his complete body and buried it in a cave at Ducheng.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Mingdao of Tiangong Temple, Luozhou, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Mingdao, family name Yao, originally from Wuxing. Due to his father's official position in Shezhou, the family settled there. From childhood he was brilliant and intelligent, outstanding beyond the ordinary. When his parents passed away, mindful that parental kindness is difficult to repay and having aspirations for transcending the world, he shaved his head and became a monk. After receiving the precepts, he carefully maintained the vinaya and had a reputation for uprightness. In the early Zhenguan period, while traveling he reached Chenzhou and encountered an imperial edict examining and retaining monks. The Master, because his virtuous reputation had long been established, was consequently...

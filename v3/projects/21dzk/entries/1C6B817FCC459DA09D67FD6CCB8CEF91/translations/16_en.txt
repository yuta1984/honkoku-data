His disciples numbered a certain number of people. Those who excelled among them were Huizang, Faxiang, and others. The Master lectured on the *Daśabhūmika Vinaya*, *Bodhisattva Precepts*, *Mahāprajñāpāramitā*, *Lotus Sutra*, and others in 140 sessions. He lectured on the *Samantamukha* chapter 102 times. His writings include *Commentary on the Great Original Vinaya Procedural Acts and Various Sutras* in thirty-six volumes. These were widely circulated at the time. Master Huicong of Gaoza Temple composed an inscription recording his virtue.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Tongyou of Yanxing Temple, Western Capital, Sui Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Tongyou, lay surname Zhao, a person of Puban in Hedong. He possessed spiritual roots from early on and entered the empty gate young. His natural endowments were remarkably outstanding, his conduct and bearing austere and dignified. After ascending the platform to receive full ordination, he studied under renowned virtuous masters and extensively practiced the vinaya sections. He applied himself with determined will to research, working as if unconscious of cold, heat, day, or night, cutting into himself, and thus mastered their essential meaning. He also paid considerable attention to meditation, and his wisdom-eye became clear and bright. From this time he greatly opened the vinaya gate and universally bestowed transformative rain. Those who came from the four directions were like ten thousand waters rushing toward a ravine. In his later years he selected land and founded Yanxing Temple. He cut timber from forests, quarried stone from mountains, requisitioned tiles from kilns—all the craftsmen arose like clouds, none daring to fall behind schedule. To protect insect life, the Master dug four great wells, each equipped with water-straining bags. Whenever there was any use of water, he personally examined it in detail, not daring to be negligent. Moreover, his established nature was pure and simple—his single room was austere with no superfluous possessions retained. His dharma robes never left his body. Each time he wished to open Buddhist scriptures he would necessarily wash his hands and wrists, and from the elbows down nothing was unclean. Fearing to defile the pure precinct, he did not carelessly spit or expectorate. For bodily functions and washing he vowed to continue until his retribution was exhausted. He often lamented to himself: "In life I have accomplished not one fragment of good; in death I will not repay one hair's worth of karmic burden. I have vainly failed the spirits—how greatly I have erred!" In the first year of Daye, year of yichou, he suddenly manifested mild illness and left final instructions to his disciples,

saying: "After I depart, immediately carry my corpse and offer it to birds and beasts. If I should receive some small merit, I hope it will extinguish remaining karmic obstacles." Having spoken, he sat upright and departed peacefully. This was the fifteenth day of the first month of that year. His worldly lifespan was fifty-seven years. His dharma years were a certain number. His disciples followed his command and buried him in the forest at the front peak of Zhongnan Zhixiang, honored his remaining bones through cremation, and built a stupa.

Praise says: Though possessed of virtue like Master You, he still said, "In life I accomplished not one fragment of good; in death I will not repay one hair's worth of karmic burden." How much more so for people like us! Alas, the Master's daily conduct and deportment is what students should adopt to encourage themselves.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Hongzun of Daxingshan Temple, Western Capital, Sui Dynasty**
The Vinaya Master's name was Hongzun, son of the Shi family of Xiangzhou. In his years of elementary learning he left home and received instruction from a certain master. His reputation became widely known. When he ascended the platform to become a great bhikṣu, he sighed deeply saying: "The foundation of leaving home lies solely in the precepts. One must concentrate one's will on their study to support accompanying practice. How can this be postponed?" He then took up his water bottle and bowl, traveled about, and arrived at the gate of Master Yun of Shaolin Temple, like refined gold going to the foundry. He concentrated on studying the vinaya sections while also exploring the *Avataṃsaka* and great treatises. Through repeated investigation and seeking, his learning made great progress. At that time Vinaya Master Hui of Yedu was vigorously promoting the *Dharmaguptaka*, and monks were flocking to gather under his seat like clouds. But his gate and courtyard were stern and strict, not easy to approach. The Master alone entered his chamber, applied the power of diligent effort, and increasingly reached its profound mysteries. Hui saw his brilliant talent and immediately commanded him to give review lectures. His spiritual eloquence was magnificently clear, and the entire assembly looked up to him like Mount Sumeru. The Master by nature enjoyed meditation, and wherever meditation gardens existed he necessarily went to study. He had many awakening realizations. Subsequently he

established the vinaya banner. His reputation for the Way resounded far and wide. Those who flocked to his assemblies reached as many as ten thousand people. This was considered a great honor at the time. The ruler of Qi inclined his heart toward Buddhism and appreciated the Master's words and conduct, appointing him as a monk judge. When any of the five assemblies violated the regulatory framework, they all had the Master judge them according to vinaya principles. At that time the various assemblies of Qing and Qi were constantly at odds, and this reached the emperor's hearing. He then commanded the Master to go and resolve the disputes. The Master used dharma for harmonious persuasion and vinaya for disciplinary correction. The disputes thus ceased. Both inside and outside obtained satisfaction from him. On the day when Zhou conquered Qi, he concealed his traces in White Deer Cliff. In the first year of Xuanzheng, Emperor Xuan ascended the throne and appointed the Master to reside at Song Mountain. In the seventh year of Sui Kaihuang, Emperor Gaozu Wen respected the Master's virtue and received him in audience at the great palace. His memorials and responses accorded with the imperial will, and he was commanded by edict to transfer to Xingshan. In the eleventh year, Sanskrit monks were translating sutras and treatises, and the Master received imperial command to participate. In the sixteenth year he was again commanded by edict to become head of the vinaya lecture assembly and transferred to Chongjing Temple. Previously in the capital region only the *Mahāsāṅghika* was revered. The Master expounded the *Lotus* in the morning and promoted the *Dharmaguptaka* in the evening. Gradually all came to follow his school. At this time the Way of correct dharma reached its peak. In the second year of Renshou he received imperial command to transport relics to Fujufa Temple in Weizhou. As they were about to display them to the assembly, they suddenly emitted red and crimson light, blazing brilliantly and illuminating the four directions. Monastics and laypeople alike witnessed this and marveled at its rarity. In the fourth year an edict was issued saying: "I have reverently received the founding mandate to nurture and protect the people, following and honoring the sacred teachings and reviving good dharma. The Tathāgata's great compassion covers and protects all beings. Through being moved to see relics, he opens and guides sentient beings. I have already distributed them far and near, and spirit pagodas have been erected everywhere. Among these, various provinces still have some not yet included. Now I again request great virtuous ones to honorably transport relics, each going to various provinces to build pagodas as before. They should share this meritorious karma with all people." The Master received the imperial command and erected a pagoda in Bozhou. When he first arrived at the western part of the province, there were several dozen white cranes that circled above the palanquin. After a long time they soared away and

departed. When he reached the eastern part of the city at Longsheng Temple where the pagoda was to be placed, at night there were several dozen paths of white light that settled on the foundation site. They flickered and glowed until roosting birds were startled and scattered. Heaven also rained precious flowers that fell in profusion. When they dug the foundation five feet deep, they obtained half a pint of millet. At night there were eighty-four immortals holding incense who circumambulated the pagoda. After a long time they disappeared. There was a woman named Li who had suffered from eye disease for over twenty years. When she came to pay reverence, suddenly both her eyes became clear and bright. Later on the evening of a circumambulation ceremony, red light was again emitted, illuminating the eastern part of the temple, revealing images of a reclining Buddha, a seated Buddha preaching dharma, and Sanskrit monks reading sutras from book stands. The sutra had fourteen characters, all in Sanskrit script. People of the time could not read them. On the eighth day of the fourth month, when the pagoda was being consecrated, countless black bees carried incense and circumambulated the pagoda. The fragrance was remarkably intense, incomparable to worldly scents. They also saw white lotus flowers at the four corners of the pagoda reaching hundreds of zhang high. The flower petals were spread out, and five-colored lotus flowers were interspersed within. They also saw heavenly beings burning incense in circumambulation. Men and women, both dark-skinned and light-skinned, all raised their voices in amazed exclamation. Some focused their eyes but could not see—was this not due to karmic differences causing variations in miraculous perception? When the pagoda consecration was completed, all the auspicious responses ceased. The Master's appearance and bearing were refined and elegant. His every movement followed proper guidelines. When he ascended the seat to expound dharma, his voice was like striking a bell. Distinguished monks and renowned scholars admired his impressive bearing and enjoyed associating with him. Those like Huiyuan especially formed lasting friendships. He passed away at Daxingshan Temple on the nineteenth day of the fifth month of the fourth year of Daye. He was seventy-nine years old. He once authored *Great Pure Compendium* in five volumes.

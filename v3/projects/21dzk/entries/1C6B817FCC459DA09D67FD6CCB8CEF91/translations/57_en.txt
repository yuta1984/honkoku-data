[His discipline] was especially rigorous. He sat for long periods without lying down throughout his life, [living] as if it were one day. His disciples included Dōbon and several others.

**Praise says:** In the Buddha Tathāgata's establishment of teachings, though there are many dharma gates, they do not exceed responding and transforming according to circumstances. Like a skillful doctor prescribing medicine according to symptoms, there are originally no differences or similarities. Those who establish differences and similarities are merely the defects of inferior learning. Vinaya Master Hongsi cultivated the three collections in perfect completion, not being confined to one corner. He completely transmitted the Tiantai teaching and contemplation at Youxi and resolved the Dharma mind-seal of Bodhidharma with Master Yi at Boshan. He urgently pursued both vehicle and precepts, and achieved perfect integration of phenomena and principle. Therefore, when he reached the moment of death and life, he did not stir in voice or countenance, transcendently passing away in sitting meditation like a practitioner returning to his former dwelling. Alas! One like the master—even monks of antiquity called "possessors of the Way"—how could they surpass this? Yet people constantly say that monks of later generations do not match those of antiquity. Is this not also slandering the people of the world?

**Biography of Great Master Jianzhen, Founder of Tōshōdai Temple in the Southern Capital**

The great master's taboo name was Jianzhen. He came from the Chunyu clan. He was a person from Jiangyang County, Guangling, in the country of China. He was a descendant of Kun, the rhetorician of Qi. He was born in the fourth year of Sisheng Dinghai. From his youth with tied hair he was intelligent and outstanding, with broad and expansive capacity and bearing. At age fourteen he accompanied his father into Dayun Temple. Seeing the Buddha image, he was moved to awakening and sought to leave household life. His father, considering his aspiration remarkable, permitted it. He thereupon relied on Chan Master Zhiman and listened to his instruction and admonishment. In the first year of Chang'an, an imperial decree went out to the realm ordaining monks. He then became Xici and was assigned to reside at Longxing, which is Dayun Temple. In the first year of Shenlong, when the master was nineteen, he received bodhisattva precepts from Vinaya Master Dao'an. In the first year of Jinglong he went to Chang'an. The following year on the twenty-eighth day of the third month, he received full ordination at Shiji Temple under Vinaya Master Heng'jing. He was already twenty-two years old. He toured the two capitals and traveled extensively to lecture halls. He studied the *Nanshan Selections* under Vinaya Master Rongli, deeply entering its essential subtleties. He also relied on the five masters Yiwei, Yuanzhi, Quanxiu, Huirong, and Daliang, listening to the *Fali Commentary* nine times. Regarding the profound doctrines of all schools, there were none he did not thoroughly comprehend. Returning to the Huai-Hai region, he benefited beings through the precepts and disciplines, flourishing as the sectarian leader of one region. Our court's Emperor Shōmu maintained himself through correct faith and devoted his will exclusively to the Buddha Vehicle. [He considered that] although this land has the Buddha Dharma, the disciplinary codes were still not complete.

He specially issued an imperial rescript commanding the two masters Eiei and Fushō to enter Tang and invite a virtuous vinaya master. The two masters accompanied Tang envoy Tanchi Guangcheng across the vast sea. In the first year of Tianbao they arrived at Daming Temple in Yangzhou, prostrated at the master's feet, and requested: "Our Fusang lies east of this land, bounded by the vast sea. We take the favorability or adversity of winds as measures of distance and nearness, making it not easy to calculate by roads. However, the Buddha Dharma throughout the world has no obstruction of 'here' and 'there,' yet the coming of teacher-exemplars is perhaps difficult. This is why the transmission of vinaya remains incomplete. Long ago Prince Shōtoku recorded: 'Two hundred years after my passing, people from foreign lands will arise and promote the true teaching.' The years already correspond, and if the preceptor could suspend his transformative work in this land to undertake practice in our country, it would be excellent." The master was moved by their intention and asked: "I have heard that Chan Master Si of Nanyue was born there as a king and raised up the Buddha Dharma. I have also heard that Prince Nagaya made a thousand kaṣāya robes, entrusted them to ships, and donated them to a thousand śramaṇas of this land. Moreover, he embroidered verses on the robe edges saying: 'Though mountains and rivers separate our lands, wind and moon share the same heaven. We send this to the Buddha's children to jointly form excellent connections.' Thinking of this, it is truly a good land. Why should I abandon myself and not undertake this journey?" He then recruited Xiangyan, Situo, Fajin, Tanjing, Yijing and more than eighty others. In the summer of the second year, in the sixth month, they prepared boats, loaded sutras and vinayas, went from the Yangtze River to the harbor of Yuezhou, and stopped at Mount Shufeng. The master had an extremely auspicious dream at night. Just as they entered the ocean they encountered wind and waves, and the boat nearly sank. When some were about to throw away aromatic wood, a voice in the sky said: "Do not throw it away." They also saw divine generals in armor standing at the bow and stern of each boat. The wind and waves soon calmed. Suddenly they drifted into the sea of serpents. The serpents were more than three zhang long, with colors like brocade patterns. They again entered the sea of fish. The fish were more than a chi long, flying and filling the sky. In the next ocean,

they saw only flying birds gathering on the boat's back, pressing down so it nearly sank. When they emerged from the bird sea, they lacked water. Suddenly they moored at an island. There was a pool, deep and clear, sweet and beautiful. Drinking from it, all achieved satisfaction. The next morning when they looked at the pool, it was nowhere to be found. Everyone thought this strange. Subsequently they arrived at Akizuma'ya Harbor in Ata District, Satsuma Province. Violent winds also arose and the boat was about to capsize. Suddenly there was a dragon spirit that emerged surging from the sea, seized the sacred relics that the master treasured, and departed. The master sighed and said to the assembly: "Long ago when the Buddha Dharma first transmitted to Han, the Han people were not informed. When it first transmitted to Wu, the Wu people were not convinced. Therefore Motan and Sengkui commanded the relics to verify the Buddha. From this time the world unanimously turned toward it. I wish to transmit the Dharma to the land of Japan and specially wear these relics—my intention lies in this alone. But now they have been seized by the dragon spirit, and I have nothing to rely upon." Thereupon he kowtowed and earnestly prayed. Then there was a giant turtle that carried [the relics] out. Suddenly it transformed into an old man who held them and presented them to the master, saying: "I am the Boundless Adorned Sea-Cloud Mighty Virtue Wheel-Canopy Dragon King from the Rain-Requesting Assembly. From now on, wherever these relics are present, I shall guard and protect them." Having finished speaking, he suddenly disappeared. The master was filled with gratitude and joy. In the winter of the fifth year of Tenpyō-shōhō, in the twelfth month, he landed and lodged at Dazaifu. The following year on the first day of the second month, he reached Naniwa in Settsu. On the third day he moved his staff and arrived at Nai Province. Deputy Minister Fujiwara Nakamarou sent an envoy to inquire after his health. The next day he entered the capital. When the emperor heard this he was greatly delighted and issued an edict sending Senior Secretary Prince Yasuyadō to welcome him outside Rajōmon Gate and lodge him at Tōdaiji. Bodhisena of India and Daoxuan of Tang visited him with great joy. The clergy and laity of the capital came bearing flowers to pay respects in throngs. The master presented three thousand Buddha relics along with sutras, texts, and dharma implements with his memorial to the court. The emperor commanded Senior Secretary Ma Kibi to

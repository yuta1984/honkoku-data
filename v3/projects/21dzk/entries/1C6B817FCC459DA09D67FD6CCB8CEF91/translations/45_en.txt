He mastered the Lotus Sutra commentary. When he began giving lectures, monks flocked to him daily. At that time, Master Zegong of Fotku was revered for the Chan way, and our Master's reputation equaled his. Soon he received an imperial edict to preside over Guoqing Temple at Tiantai. Originally, Great Master Zhizhe had established a Golden Light Sutra assembly every year in the ninth month for about seven days, gathering the four assemblies for spiritual cultivation. At that time donations poured in abundantly and offerings were plentiful. After the Great Master's death, times changed and the assembly gradually became desolate, nearly ceasing by this time. During the Taihe era, the temple administrator monk Qingyun consulted with the Master and established twelve qing of temple lands to provide for the food expenses of the Golden Light assembly. From this point it became sufficient to transmit the tradition for a long time. He passed away in the fifth month of the second year of Huichang. His worldly age was eighty-three, his monastic years fifty-five. His ordained disciples included Youqing and several others. A stupa was erected on the western peak of the temple. Han You composed the inscription. The Master was over six feet tall. Among ten thousand monks, he was like a crane among chickens. His eyes never wandered about, his mouth spoke no frivolous words, and in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, nothing was outside the vinaya standards.

**Biography of Great Master Fabao of Zongchi Temple**
The Great Master's taboo name was Xuanchang, courtesy name Shenzhi. He came from the Chen family of Xuancheng. As a child he was exceptionally intelligent, different from ordinary children. When playing, he would gather sand to make stupas and pick leaves for incense. At nine he studied the canonical texts under Venerable Qingyi at Shuixi Temple in Jing County. At nineteen he received ordination, and at twenty received full precepts at the ordination platform of Tushita [Temple] in Fuzhou. He studied the vinaya curriculum and deeply grasped its essential meaning. Learning that there was the former quarters of Great Master Chengzhao at Ximing Temple in the capital, where Vinaya Master Huizheng resided and taught, he immediately went there. With his naturally outstanding character, when mingling among the assembly his prominence was especially high. After long devoted service, he finally obtained the dharma transmission. He was a sixth-generation spiritual descendant

of Great Master Chengzhao. He received the position of Great Virtue of the Three Studies and became famous for lecturing on vinaya. During the Huichang era, Emperor Wu abolished the teachings. The clergy of the capital region were deeply worried. At that time the monastic recorders of the two streets, Lingyan and Bianzhang, gathered the assembly for discussion and submitted a memorial in remonstrance, hoping the emperor would listen and rescind the previous edict. They elected our Master as their leader. The Master then aroused his spirit to protect the dharma, wrote the "Record of Emperors Through the Ages," and submitted it as remonstrance, but it was not accepted. The Master did not slacken his dedication to the Way, dwelling in seclusion and awaiting the right time. At the beginning of Dazhong, Emperor Xuanzong restored the teachings. The Master received an edict to enter the inner court and proclaimed the dharma essentials. The emperor was greatly pleased and appointed him Great Virtue Presiding Over Internal and External Ordination Platforms. He was granted a set of dharma robes. During the Xiantong era, Emperor Yizong revered the Master's virtue and bestowed frequent honors. The Master memorialized to include the "Fundamental Consciousness and Mental Ground Contemplation Sutra" in the canon. Subsequently he received orders to serve as head of the Merit-Dedication Institute and concurrently as first seat of Zongchi Temple. In the first year of Qianfu he was granted the title Great Master Fabao. On the twenty-first day of the third month of the second year he passed away. His secular age was seventy-nine, his monastic years fifty-nine. His disciples interred him on the twenty-fifth day of the fourth month of that year at Xiaoliang Village in Gaoyang Township of Chang'an County. His ordained disciples numbered in the thousands. Those who inherited his dharma included Yuanbiao, Huirou, and several others. The Master lectured on vinaya sixty times. His writings include the "Record Revealing the Correct Meaning of the Commentary" in ten fascicles, and "Diagrams of Names and Meanings," "Three Jewels," and "Five Movements" in three fascicles each. The Master was also one of the sixty [great vinaya masters]. Minister and Vice Minister of Rites Cui Hang inscribed his stele to praise his virtue.

The eulogy says: When people dwell in peaceful times without troubles, even the most inferior can manage to fulfill their duties. But when encountering disasters and changes, only extraordinary and uncommon persons can maintain their integrity. During the Huichang persecution of Buddhism, people's worries increased a hundredfold. The Great Master forgot his own safety to defend the Great Dharma, feared no威 authority, and submitted memorials of remonstrance. Regrettably,

the emperor stubbornly refused to follow his advice. Yet the Great Master remained consistent through adversity and prosperity, never changing his constant demeanor. In the end he encountered an era of enlightened governance and renewal, reviving the religious tradition from its decline. He was truly an extraordinary and uncommon person, bringing no shame to being a sixth-generation spiritual descendant of [Daoxuan of] Nanshan.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Congzhi**
In the capital region there was a Vinaya Master named Congzhi. His family name is unknown. He was a disciple of Vinaya Master Huizheng of Ximing [Temple]. He mastered the vinaya canon and could explain every character without doubt. From then on he expounded [the dharma] constantly without a day of leisure. Both clergy and laity revered him unanimously. Xuanli, Yancheng and others all entered his school to study. The Master once wrote "Continuing the Lineage Record of the Commentary" in several fascicles. He was one of the sixty [great vinaya masters].

**Biography of Vinaya Master Wenju Changda of Poshan Temple in Wu Commandery**
The Vinaya Master's taboo name was Changda, courtesy name Wenju, surname Gu. His family had long resided by the sea. In his early years he left secular life. From Dafu Mountain in Heyang he traveled to study at various monasteries in the Jiang-Huai region. At twenty-three he received full ordination and specialized intensively in vinaya. He also studied the Lotus and Nirvana [sutras], delved into the Yinfu and Laozi-Zhuangzi texts, and practiced calligraphy in the style of the Two Wangs. He also engaged with Chan principles and considerably reached their subtlety, believing that vinaya was not separate from Chan. It happened that Emperor Wuzong was deluded by heterodox teachings and abolished the Great Teaching. The Master sighed: "I was born at an inauspicious time to witness such things." Therefore he dwelt in mountains and wilderness to adapt to these changes. When Emperor Xuanzong ascended the throne, Buddhism flourished again and monasteries and hermitages were everywhere restored. The Master then returned to his native place. Prefect Wei Shu held him in great esteem. In the twelfth year of Xiantong he accepted an invitation to lecture on vinaya. Daily more of the four assemblies came for instruction. On the self-confession day of monks in the seventh month of the fifteenth year,

he invited the monks of both ranks, pressed his palms together and spoke of parting. Soon after he showed signs of illness, not recovering for a long time and abstaining from food for seven days and nights. On the sixteenth day of the ninth month he peacefully passed away. His age was seventy-four, having sat [in meditation] for fifty-one summers. His ordained disciples included Huiqing, Chuanlang and several others. They escorted his coffin and interred it three hundred paces southeast of the temple. After three years, they built a stupa at the gravesite. Chen Yan of Yingchuan composed the inscription. The Master's aspirations were pure and lofty, dwelling tranquilly beyond the world. He resided in forests and hills, often for several years at a time. His dwelling was covered with vines, but he paid no attention. Thinking that silken clothing was not the garb of the compassionate, he never wore it his entire life. In his leisure from practicing the Way, he enjoyed composing poetry and prose using the Yuanhe style. He once wrote "Song of Walking the Way in Green Mountains," which spread on people's lips.

The eulogy says: Animal fur and silkworm products harm beings and injure compassion. Even gentlemen of the Confucian school practice moderation regarding them. How much more so for followers of Buddhism! Therefore the vinaya regulations do not permit their use. Now observing Vinaya Master Da, who never wore silk clothing his entire life - was he not one who could embody the Buddha's compassionate conduct? Someone said: "Silk clothing is regulated by the minor vinaya, but the Mahayana is not necessarily bound by it." I replied: "How can you speak so easily? Not wearing silk floss, silk fabric, boots, fur coats and down garments is a clear teaching of the Shurangama [Sutra]. Leather, sandals, and kausheya garments - not keeping any such clothing is also a clear teaching of the Nirvana [Sutra]. Have you not heard this?" He said: "The celestial Subhuti dwelled in a seven-jeweled house, obtained fine clothing and food, and immediately attained the fruit of no-more-learning. Attaining the Way lies in the mind - what significance could physical garments have?" I said: "Your words are indeed beautiful. However, try reflecting upon yourself and thinking about it. Is it really for attaining the Way or not? Now your mind is focused on warmth while you set aside the Way without discussing it. Not knowing

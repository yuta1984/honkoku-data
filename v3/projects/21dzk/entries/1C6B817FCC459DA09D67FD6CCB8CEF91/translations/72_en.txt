**Biography of Bodhisattva Ninshō of Reishūzan Gokurakuji**

The Bodhisattva's religious name was Ninshō, with the courtesy name Ryōkan. He was born on the 16th day of the 7th month of the 5th year of Kenpō (1217) to the Ban family of Isagawa in Yamato Province. His father's name was Sadayuki and his mother was of the Enoki family. From childhood the master was intelligent and wise, possessing an transcendent character. His parents cherished him deeply. At the mere age of eleven, he went to Mount Shigi and vowed never to eat meat. At sixteen, his mother contracted an illness. The master attended to her medicine and never once left her side. When her condition became critical, she said to him: "If I must die, then I die. The only regret is that I cannot see you in the form of a śramaṇa." The master immediately shaved his hair and became a monk. At his mother's funeral, his grief exceeded proper bounds. Thinking that parental kindness is difficult to repay, he went to Gakuanji and requested the monks to perform Buddhist services. He also commissioned seven paintings of Mañjuśrī images and installed them in various temples to aid her spiritual welfare. At nineteen, he visited Mount Ikoma every month, taking refuge in the great Mañjuśrī, fasting and chanting the five-character mantra 500,000 times. After three years he went to the Southern Capital and met Kōshō Bodhisattva of Saidaiji. Kōshō immediately recognized his capacity and conferred the Ten Major Precepts upon him. In the spring of the 1st year of Ninji (1240), he studied the Brahmā's Net Sutra under Daihi Bodhisattva. Soon he entered Kōshō's circle, receiving śrāmaṇera precepts on the 3rd day of the 4th month and progressing to full ordination on the 11th. He was then twenty-four years old. He refined himself in comprehensive learning, and his wisdom and understanding advanced daily. Also receiving direct transmission from Daihi, he

further mastered the school's principles. His reputation spread far and wide, with various provinces admiring his spiritual influence. In the 3rd year of Kangen (1245), he again received full ordination through the separate ordination method. In the 4th year of Kenchō (1252), he privately lamented: "My teacher has made the Nanshan school flourish in the southern provinces, but it has not yet penetrated the Kantō region. I should go there to promote and guide it. How can a great-hearted bodhisattva be confined to just one region?" He then took up his staff and went to Hitachi Province, opening a vinaya seat at Seiryōin. Students rejoiced, saying the uḍumbara flower had appeared once again, and competed to follow him. Happening to walk to Mimurajdera, the temple master joyfully yielded his seat for the master to reside there. In the 1st year of Kōchō (1261) he entered Sagami Province. Vice-Marshal Hōjō Tokiyori founded Kōsenji temple and, admiring the master's virtue, invited him to be the founding abbot. He lectured daily on religious teachings, and monks gathered around him. In the 2nd year of Bun'ei (1265) he performed the complete limb abhiṣeka. Takeshi Province Governor Hōjō Nagatoki became patron and requested him to be founding abbot of Gokuraku Ritsuji. The master opened wide the gates of sweet dew, and monks and laypeople from all directions rushed to him. Morning and evening bells and chanting were clear and distinct, and the two daily meals of rice gruel were clean and pure. His regulations were exemplary, well-ordered and systematic. In the sixth year there was severe drought. When the master prayed for rain at Enoshima, it immediately responded. In the 1st year of Kenji (1275) the temple was destroyed by fire. As the master was deliberating reconstruction, he received a dream vision of Mañjuśrī who said: "I will exert my power to assist the construction. Do not worry." Upon awakening he was greatly pleased and selected materials for construction. Monks and laypeople rushed to contribute their efforts, and before long everything was restored as before. The master then assembled the community to perform Buddhist services and celebrated the completion. Those who came from all directions to rejoice all increased their faith. In the 1st year of Kōan (1278) he built a pagoda on Mount Shitao. In the fourth year, Mongol forces intended to invade our country. Emperor Go-Uda issued an edict for the master to perform protective rituals for the nation. The master led his followers up Mount Ina and held a Benevolent Kings Assembly. The emperor was pleased and made Gokurakuji an imperial prayer temple. In the 4th year of Shōō (1291) he constructed an ordination

platform and performed the separate ordination method. Sixty people ascended the platform. The following year, the 25th day of the 8th month was the anniversary of Kōshō Bodhisattva's death. The master went to Saidaiji to hold memorial services, donating a thousand robes to the monks. His spirit of gratitude to his roots was especially earnest. The master's conduct was simple and pure; he viewed worldly fame and profit like chaff. Even with worn clothes and vegetarian food, he bore it with equanimity. He regularly lectured on the Nanshan Rules for Robes and Deportment, forbidding people from wearing silk clothing. He once gathered over 10,000 people with skin diseases, provided them with food, and conferred the Eight Precepts and Fasting upon them. There was one leper whose hands and feet were twisted and who could not beg for alms. The master pitied him and every morning carried him to the market, and every evening carried him back to his dwelling. He personally washed and massaged him without being disgusted by the filth. This continued for several years, never ceasing despite cold, heat, wind or rain. Whatever donations he received he immediately distributed to various prisons, sometimes ransoming lives, sometimes commissioning Buddha images, sometimes copying sacred texts, sometimes digging charitable wells, sometimes building bridges, sometimes repairing roads. When he met someone cold he would take off his clothes to give them; when he encountered poor people he would share his resources with them. Seeing blind people he would always give them staffs; seeing puppies he would give them food. When he met abandoned children on the road he would always have people nurse and raise them. He also built stables to house sick horses and had people chant Buddha's names for them at times. He wrote esoteric mantras on small tablets and had them tied around the animals' necks. When he encountered years of great famine, he would cook rice gruel to feed the hungry. When the country suffered great epidemics, he would gather the sick in front of his gates to care for them, and they would recover. How could he not be a healing king who saves the world? Hearing that Prince Shōtoku had four institutions called Seyaku (Medicine Distribution), Ryōbyō (Healing), Hiden (Compassion Field), and Kyōden (Respect Field), he greatly admired this. Therefore wherever he went he established institutions for healing and compassion. Over twenty years, 46,800 people recovered. Vice-Marshal Hōjō Tokimune, considering his work righteous, donated the Dainin Estate in Tosa Province to fund these activities. In the 2nd year of Einin (1294)

he received an imperial edict to serve as administrator of Tennōji. With his salary surplus he expanded the two institutions of compassion and respect. The temple had a decorative pillar that was about to collapse from age. The master ordered craftsmen to gather stones and completely rebuild it. Measuring with a ruler, its length was twenty-five feet. The master frequently established religious communities - at Hannya in Yamato, Tada in Settsu, extending to Daiji, Tahō, Fudo, Eifuku, Myōō, Fusai, Jōkō, and Seito - all with achievements. In the 1st year of Kagen (1303), drought again brought devastation. When the master prayed at Seiryū Shrine, he suddenly saw a small snake appear. That very day sweet rain fell universally, thoroughly moistening the entire land. People considered this a manifestation of his spiritual power. On the 23rd day of the 6th month of that year he showed slight illness. Monks, nuns, and laymen and laywomen came in continuous succession to inquire about his condition. The master's responses were as usual. At his final moment he donned his saṃghāṭī, summoned the monks and finished giving final instructions, formed the mudra and recited mantras, then passed away sitting upright. This was actually at the hour of the Rat on the 12th day of the 7th month of the 1st year of Kagen (1303). His disciples performed cremation and collected his sacred bones, obtaining countless relics. Pagodas were built at three temples - Gokurakuji, Chikurinji, and Gakuanji - following his final instructions. He lived eighty-seven years with sixty-three years in monastic life. The disciples he ordained numbered over 2,740. Lay disciples were countless. He lectured on the Three Great Works seven times, and on the Bodhisattva Precepts, Essential Teachings, Instructional Admonitions, and Vinaya Rules thirty times each. He lectured on the Brahmā's Net Ancient Traces, Pure Mind Admonitions and Contemplations, and others numerous times. He consecrated seventy-nine temple compounds. He built eighty-three monastic complexes, twenty Buddha pagodas, and fourteen sets of the complete Buddhist canon. He constructed 189 bridges across rivers in various provinces. He established prohibition of killing in sixty-three villages. He donated over 1,300 Buddha images, over 3,300 volumes of vinaya texts, and over 30,000 kaṣāya robes. He once created a ten-foot-six-inch Mañjuśrī statue - the current image at Hannyaji

teachings at Hōonin from Monsō Kenjin. Kenjin was a great master of the esoteric gate. He also studied the Three Treatises under Great Virtue Jukei, investigating their profound and hidden aspects. His reputation for doctrinal understanding was unparalleled in his generation. He restored Shingonin in the Southern Capital and resided there, promoting both exoteric and esoteric teachings. When he once accepted an invitation to lecture on the Three Treatises, those carrying study boxes to attend the lectures were as numerous as rice and hemp stalks. During the Katei era (1235-1238), he again received full ordination under Daihi Bodhisattva. He devoted his thoughts to the vinaya section and deeply mastered the principles of permission and prohibition. There was Kenshō Gyōsei, inspector of Iwashimizu, who newly built a Buddhist temple and requested the master to be its founding abbot. It was named Hōenji. Here his spiritual influence flourished even more, and clergy and laity alike turned to him with complete devotion. One day he showed slight illness, and at his deathbed he held a vajra in his hand, sat upright as if in meditation, and passed away. This was actually the 27th day of the 11th month of the 4th year of Shōō (1291). He lived seventy-three years. His monastic age is not detailed. A pagoda was built in the northwestern corner of the temple. His chief dharma successor was Vinaya Master Dōgetsunen.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Jisshō of Kaidanin**
The vinaya master's religious name was Enshō, titled Jissō. He was the younger brother of Vinaya Master Chūdō. His understanding and capacity were broad and clear, intelligent and outstanding. Transcending the bonds of his two parents, he joyfully entered the Way. Eventually he received progressive ordination under Daihi Bodhisattva, sharpened his blade through learning, and did not avoid cold or heat. His mastery of vinaya earned him great reputation in his time. He also studied Yogācāra under Vinaya Master Shingan Ben, as well as Kegon, Three Treatises, Abhidharmakośa, and Satyasiddhi, extending to Zen, Esoteric, Tendai, and Pure Land schools - there was none he did not investigate and penetrate to its subtleties. Through this, elderly teachers and established scholars all acknowledged his precedence. He once received full ordination again from Kōshō Bodhisattva using the separate ordination method. Kaidanin in the Southern Capital, in the aftermath of military devastation, had become a wasteland. There was one called Saikō Jitsu who, seeing this, was moved to sorrow and devoted his heart to reconstruction. The main halls, kitchens, storehouses and such were all completed within a short time, restoring the former glory of Great Master Jianzhen. At that time the master was residing at Kairyūōji. The gentleman deeply admired the master's virtue and requested him to fill the position. The master consented. This was in the 3rd year of Kenchō (1251). He proclaimed both vinaya and esoteric teachings while also promoting all schools. Masters Enkū, Zengan, Dōhon, Jikkyō and others attended the master's left and right to support his transformative work. Whenever the master ascended to Ugekadō hall, his wisdom and eloquence flowed unobstructed like a hanging river or gushing spring. Students gathered from all four directions, and none left without being thoroughly nourished and satisfied. The prosperity of his vinaya seat was rarely matched in those times. From that time forward, he presided over the seats of over ten Buddhist temples, such as Zenpōji and Kinzanin. Throughout his life the master concentrated his mind on moon-disk meditation and had a luminous body. When he chanted sutras during the night watch for writing, he did not use lamps or candles. There was a woman in Shirakawa who contracted a strange illness - something lurked in her abdomen, hard as stone, causing myriad forms of piercing pain. Her relatives requested the master to save and rescue her. The master immediately applied the Acala fire-realm mantra to her. The woman's illness was instantly cured. Court and countryside transmitted this as miraculous. When his transformative conditions were complete, he proclaimed his extinction at Washioyama on the 22nd day of the 10th month of the 3rd year of Kenji (1277). He lived fifty-seven years. His monastic age is unspecified. His dharma-heir disciples were very numerous; the foremost, Venerable Gyōnen, composed his biographical account in three volumes. From this the abundance of his beautiful words and excellent conduct can be known.

In praise it is said: The two masters Chūdō and Jissō both clearly combined precepts and meditation, and were complete in both merit and wisdom. Their capacity was like Mount Tai accepting clouds, their spirit like spring wind touching all things. Therefore their spiritual reputation stood side by side in their time, and none of the seven assemblies failed to bathe in their profound transformation. What is called "a worthy elder brother and worthy younger brother" - these two masters exemplified this.

Keiun resided at Tachibanadera, Zen'e was based at Daian; they promoted the school's guiding principles and became what the assembly esteemed.

**Biography of Vinaya Masters Kakujo and Jōshun**
Kakujo was styled Jōgan, Jōshun was styled Ryūshin. Both were disciples of Kōshō Bodhisattva. After receiving full ordination, they received vinaya learning from Kōshō. During the Kangen era (1243-1247), Master Ninshō lamented that the doctrinal texts of this country were not yet complete and intended to enter China to transmit them, but due to karmic obstacles this was not accomplished. Therefore he urged Kakujo to take his place. Kakujo gladly agreed. He went alone to Song China. Kōshō was deeply moved by his aspiration and had Jōshun accompany him. The two masters were in China for about three years, obtaining vinaya texts along with various sutras and treatises. In the 2nd year of Hōji (1248), Ninshō and others, hearing that the two masters wished to return, went to Chinzei to await them. In the 6th month of summer the two masters landed, and in the 8th month arrived at Saidai. They then presented the transmitted texts to Kōshō. The two masters' sincerity for the dharma can be called deep indeed.

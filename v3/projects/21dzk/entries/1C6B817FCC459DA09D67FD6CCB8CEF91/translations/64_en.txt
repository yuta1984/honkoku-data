**Biography of Jōgyō, Dharma Master Donshō of Kaikō Temple, the Founding Master**
The Dharma Master's posthumous name was Jōgyō, his courtesy name Hōnin. His title was Donshō. His clan lineage is not detailed. He was born on the 18th day of the 6th month of the 3rd year of Bunji (1187). At fifteen he took the tonsure, and at the age of majority received full ordination. He specialized in studying vinaya and also studied both Tendai and Shingon teachings. Hearing that the Dharma of vinaya flourished greatly in Song China, in the spring of the 2nd year of Kenpō (1214) he crossed the sea and traveled south. This coincided with the 7th year of Jiading under Emperor Ningzong (1214). At that time, Dharma Master Tetsuō Ichi resided at Jinpeak and was renowned in his generation. The master entered his gate and received full ordination again. He deeply grasped the essence of vinaya. Emperor Lizong heard of his reputation and granted him an audience to consult on dharma essentials. The master's responses were detailed and clear. The Dragon Countenance was greatly pleased and bestowed upon him the title "Patient Vinaya Dharma Master." His return was in the 2nd year of Antei (1228). The court, admiring his virtue, created a monastery for him. The site selection remained undecided. One night the master dreamed: south of the nine districts of Kyoto there was a place that produced sixteen-foot blue lotus flowers, their light illuminating the ten directions, with countless sacred assemblies surrounding them front and back. Upon awakening he traced this vision and indeed found an auspicious site. He reported this to the court, and by imperial edict construction was undertaken at that location. Upon completion it was named Kaikō. A sixteen-foot image of Śākyamuni was installed - this embodied his determination not to forget the auspicious dream. From that time forward, the Yan Hui and Min Ziqian of the dharma gate competed to arrive, and vinaya studies flourished greatly in the world. In the early Tenpuku years he again entered Song China, extensively seeking sacred sites and returning with many Buddha images and Sanskrit texts. At Dazaifu in Chikuzen he built a vinaya cloister called Sairin. He lectured on vinaya and propagated the dharma. He constantly served Cintāmaṇicakra Avalokiteśvara, and the spiritual responses were manifold. The four assemblies looked up to him in reverence; even previous sages had areas where they could not match him. Later he also founded a temple in the eastern mountains of Kyoto called Tōrin.

This became a sub-temple of Kaikō Temple. He had his chief disciple Jōin serve as abbot while the master retired to a quiet chamber, specializing in nembutsu samādhi cultivation. At his final moment his contemplative focus did not waver, and he passed away sitting upright. This was on the 21st day of the 2nd month of the 1st year of Shōgen (1259). His worldly lifespan was seventy-three years, his dharma age fifty-three years. According to ancient virtue traditions, the master was an incarnation of Cintāmaṇicakra, inwardly concealing bodhisattva conduct while outwardly manifesting śrāvaka form.

The eulogy states: Great Wisdom Dharma Master Lingzhi carried on the orthodox transmission of Nanshan from above. Those who received the dharma were certainly many, but Dharma Master Fohu i was his true heir. Fohu i transmitted through four generations to become Fajiu and Ruan. Fajiu's heir was called Miaolian, while Ruan's heir was Tetsuō. The master opened the dharma at Jinpeak, solemnly like a veteran general ascending the altar with the eight directions showing reverence and respect. Dharma Master Donshō, not fearing the perils of ocean waves, directly entered his chamber and received the dharma. Having returned, he greatly established brahma monasteries and flourishingly propagated this Way. Clergy and laypeople followed him like clouds returning to peaks. Is this not the case that when roots are deep, branches naturally flourish? I once visited Kaikō to call on the two elders Tenkai and Tanchō, and took the opportunity to pay respects to the sandalwood Śākyamuni image transmitted by the master. The brahma features were stern and solemn, hardly what ordinary craftsmen could achieve. I immediately sighed and said: "Without the master's power, how could the true body have blessed this land? This is truly a treasure that protects the monastery."

**Biography of Dharma Master Kūgetsu Shinkai**
The Dharma Master's name was Shinkai, with the title Kūgetsu. His clan lineage and native place are not detailed. He naturally possessed profound talent and deeply investigated the hidden mysteries of exoteric and esoteric teachings. Moreover, he was capable in waka poetry, which was esteemed in his time, yet his nature was serene and indifferent, not concerning himself with fame and glory. Suddenly hearing that the National Master of True Dharma had returned from Song China, he especially went to pay his respects. The National Master extremely approved of him and showed him the principles of the One Vehicle perfect and sudden teaching. Upon hearing it once, the master transcendentally comprehended it. When the National Master opened Sennyū Temple, he appointed him to serve as head seat. The master assisted in propagating the dharma transformation with distinguished grace. In the spring of the 3rd year of Karoku (1227), as the National Master was about to demonstrate passing away, the master had the Song painter Zhou Danzhi paint his portrait. The National Master composed a self-eulogy for it. The master also requested dharma words. The National Master wrote: "The three thousand and three truths are inherently complete in the present thought. Understanding inherent completeness, one is no different from Buddha. What is this understanding? Look with both true and false completely cut off." The master made prostrations and withdrew. After the National Master's passing, he gave precepts and expounded dharma, having the glory of continuing his teacher's Way. He once resided at Shōman'in in Settsu Province and became an object of admiration for scholars.

exposition. He resided at Sennyū as the third generation abbot. In the 3rd year of Kajō (1237) he accepted an invitation to lecture on vinaya at Nanto's Kairyūō Temple. Dragons coiling and phoenixes soaring - such outstanding monks competed to gather under his seat. Figures like Kakujō, Eizon, Ryōhen, Zen'e, and Gentoshun were among such people. After residing there for ninety days, he immediately returned to Sennyū. He passed away on the 5th day of the 3rd month of the 2nd year of Kangen (1244).

Later he relied on Dharma Master Jōjun to seek further instruction. He headed Sennyū Temple as the fourth generation. He also resided at Raigō'in. His excellent reputation spread far and wide, with people near and far returning to his virtue. In a certain year he crossed the sea and entered Song China, traveling extensively throughout various regions to consult on the essence of vinaya. His achievements can thus be seen. He also admired the style of Shandao and Lingzhi, focusing his mind on Pure Land teachings. There was Lanxi Long - a great master of the Chan school. The master's spiritual connection with him was like gold and orchid. Later returning to Japan, his dharma transformation became increasingly flourishing. Black-robed monks came rushing to him. During the Kangen years, Master Long crossed eastward to Japan and first lodged at Raigō'in. The master, mindful that he was a guest from a foreign land, treated him extremely well. In the 1st year of Hōji (1247), when Zendō of Seizan was about to demonstrate passing away, he welcomed the master to discuss the meaning of bodhisattva precepts - this was because he admired the master's Way and conduct. The master entered extinction on the 2nd day of the 3rd month of a certain year. His lifespan is not detailed.

The eulogy states: From Master Chikyō rightward, these eight people all assisted the National Master of True Dharma in greatly reviving the sectarian framework. Their dharma voices resounded magnificently, captivating both near and far. The so-called emergence of sages and worthies in the world all have fellow practitioners from causal stages as enlightened beings.

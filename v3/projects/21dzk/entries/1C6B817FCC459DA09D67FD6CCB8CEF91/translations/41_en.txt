**Biography of Vinaya Master Shenggong of Huizhao Temple in Yangzhou**
The Vinaya Master's name was Shenggong. He was from Tonglu in Muzhou. Historical records do not mention his surname. From childhood he had a strong memory, great aspirations and lofty speech. Elderly masters all regarded his capacity as remarkable. He paid respects to a certain old master at Shengde Temple, received tonsure and full ordination. His spiritual nature was heaven-sent, and his investigation of vinaya seemed like something he had possessed from previous lives. Soon he heard of the good reputation of Vinaya Master Daoheng of Kaiyuan Temple in Gusu and specially went to visit him. The teacher-student relationship was perfectly matched. Heng secretly rejoiced, saying: "How profound - my obtaining Gong!" The disciples grew closer day by day. The Master practiced diligently, not fearing heat or cold. He finally obtained the dharma. He was actually the fourth-generation successor of Great Master Chengzhao. He not only thoroughly studied the inner teachings but also mastered Confucian learning. When there were those who engaged in doctrinal debates and pointed to each other as deluded, they requested the Master to make judgments. The Master distinguished right from wrong as clearly as distinguishing black from white. Hence the saying: "Principles are exhaustively [understood by] Shenggong." Heng also sighed and said: "Since I obtained Gong, I no longer hear harsh words." The Master avoided his seat and replied: "I revere my master's Way like gathering mulberry leaves to feed silkworms. What troubles me is that I cannot yet spin fine silk to repay my lord." Heng said: "Your words are too modest. Seeing you spin the garden guest's five-colored silk, it can provide material for embroidery." Such was how he was approved by his master. In his later years he taught in Weiyang, where monastics and laypeople competed to honor him. Later it is unknown where he passed away. His writings include *Sequential Records of Vinaya Commentary*

**Right Page Lower Section**
in ten volumes, *Classification of Light and Heavy Matters* in several volumes, and *Commentary on the Sutra Praising the Pure Land* in two volumes. The Master was also one of the sixty schools. His disciples included Huwen and several others. He had a foremost dharma heir named Vinaya Master Huizheng who resided at Ximing in Jingzhao and greatly promoted the Master's Way.

The eulogy says: Confucius said: "Since I have had Yan Hui, my disciples have grown closer." He also said: "Since I have had Zilu, I no longer hear harsh words." Now observing Master Gong's relationship with Master Heng, he combined both these qualities. How outstanding he was! However, this was merely the Master's minor accomplishments - one cannot say his Way was exhausted by this alone.

The Vinaya Master's name was Changjin. It is unknown what region he was from. He studied under Vinaya Master Daoheng of Kaiyuan Temple in Gusu. His spiritual wisdom was clear and bright, his understanding and awakening surpassed all others. After tonsure and receiving full ordination, he extensively studied vinaya texts, being particularly skilled in the *Vinaya Commentary*. He emerged at Tongxuan Vinaya Temple and expounded vinaya widely. Those who came to receive teachings were like a bustling marketplace. Master Zhencheng's opening dharma teaching at great temples and being revered by people was also due to this Master's guidance and instruction. The Master once compiled *Tongxuan Records of Vinaya Commentary* in several volumes. This is also one of the sixty schools.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Zhencheng of Bashengdao Temple in Huzhou**

**Left Page Upper Section**
The Vinaya Master's name was Zhencheng. His surname was Shen. He was from Deqing in Huzhou. His father was Xuanwang, who was recommended as Garrison Commander of Gunzhou through the filial and incorrupt examination. When his mother was pregnant with the Master, there were auspicious signs of divine light and extraordinary energy. When he was born, his heavenly appearance was magnificent. Among his equals, he was like seeing a jade tree among common grasses. He constantly used Buddha images as playthings. The Garrison Commander advised him that he must study literature to obtain official position, but he showed a sorrowful expression of reluctance. His parents perceived that he had connections beyond the dusty world and allowed him to become a monk. At that time Duke Yan Zhenqing of Lu was testing sutra knowledge to ordain people. He had the Master recite what he had studied. The Master recited five hundred pages of Buddhist sutras without a single error or mistake. The Duke greatly praised this as extraordinary. He then had his head shaved and resided at Bashengdao Temple. After receiving full ordination, he thoroughly mastered the vinaya section under Vinaya Master Changjin of Tongxuan Temple. Jin loved his outstanding talent and said to the assembly: "Cheng is not merely equal to you all." From then on the entire assembly held him in awe. Soon he went west to the capital and studied the Tiantai Lotus Commentary at Yunhua Temple. His reputation spread magnificently. The assembly of Zhangxin Temple then invited him. During his teaching periods, he combined the mysteries of sutra doctrine and vinaya authority without shame before the assembly. During the Zhenyuan period, Merit Commissioner Duke Liang memorialized that since Emperor Dezong frequently visited Anguo Temple, responding to imperial questions required none other than the Master, and thus petitioned to appoint him as Attending Great Virtue. At that time his original master Wuzhi also received imperial favor through his practice of the Way. He recommended the Master to pray for blessings for the nation, but the Master requested leave to return home due to illness. Previously Wuzhi had dreamed of the Master holding white lotus flowers and departing southward. At this point it indeed proved prophetic. The Master served eight times as Vinaya Study Director in his hometown and four times as Official Member of the Ordination Platform, all at the request of various renowned officials and scholars. He once traveled to Mount Wutai and paid respects to the sacred image of Manjusri. The auspicious signs he witnessed were immeasurable. In his later years

he resided at Huguo Temple, performed the Buddha Name Sutra ceremony one hundred times, and never missed daily repentance practices. In the winter tenth month of the fifteenth year of Yuanhe, he showed illness and passed away. His age is not detailed. Two years later, on the thirteenth day of the tenth month of Changqing renyin year, he was cremated at the western edge of Shao village, following his final instructions. The Master once authored *Records of Lotus Commentary Explanations* in ten volumes. County Assistant Wang Zhen composed a stele inscription to perpetuate his excellent reputation.

The eulogy says: Master Cheng possessed three excellences: First, while in the womb there were auspicious signs of divine light and extraordinary energy. Second, at a young age he could memorize five hundred pages. Third, paying respects to Manjusri at Wutai, the auspicious signs he experienced transcended conceptual understanding. Therefore his ability to become renowned through this Way was fitting indeed.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Tanqing**

**Biography of Vinaya Master Daobiao of Mount Lingyin in Hangzhou**
The Vinaya Master's name was Biao. He was from Fuyang. His lay surname was Qin. His family was known as a clan of Confucian officials. When the Master was seven years old, his spiritual energy was outstanding and he was unlike ordinary children. A divine monk touched his head and said: "This child's bone structure is pure and lofty, his eyes are like blue lotuses. I fear worldly dharmas cannot bind him. If you have him study Buddhism, he will certainly achieve good reputation." His father thought this was correct and had him take refuge with Master Hai of White Cloud Peak on Mount Lingyin as a disciple. In the second year of Zhide, Emperor Suzong issued an edict throughout the realm that laypeople who mastered seven hundred pages of Buddhist sutras...

scatter to the four directions, with only the two sticks inscribed "Nine" and "Eight" standing upright in the center of the platform - this indicates obtaining the supreme grade of precept marks. If among the 108 sticks only one or two touch the "Nine" and "Eight" sticks, simply observe what afflictions are inscribed on the touching sticks. Then you will know that these afflictions are not yet exhausted, and that person should be made to repeat the repentance of sins. Afterward, again match the previously touched sticks with the "Nine" and "Eight" sticks and cast them into the air. Those sticks that do not touch but go far away are called middle-grade precept marks. If the 108 sticks ultimately cover and obstruct the "Nine" and "Eight" sticks, their sins are not extinguished and they do not receive precepts. If they can sincerely repent sins and after ninety days again perform the previous method without obstruction, they receive lower-grade precepts. Moreover it says: "Eight represents newly perfumed [consciousness], Nine represents inherent [Buddha-nature]." Then it disappeared. Flowers withered, fragrances died out, mountains and rivers became desolate. At this the Master donned robes and held his bowl, like a bhikṣu of five summers' standing. When he thought of descending the mountain to benefit sentient beings, grasses and trees drooped and swayed, valleys became smooth and level. Auspicious birds and miraculous beasts danced in flight, tame and submissive before and behind him. Also voices in the air chanted: "The Bodhisattva emerges from the mountain - why do you not welcome him?" Therefore the people, men and women, came rushing out in amazement. Some spread their hair to cover mud, some removed their clothes to cover the road, some used felt carpets and rugs to support his feet, some used flower bundles and fine cushions to fill potholes. The Master trod upon all of these to fulfill their intentions. There was a woman who spread out half a length of white felt and waited. The Master was startled and avoided going elsewhere. The woman wondered at his lack of equal treatment and questioned him. He said: "I am not without reason. Looking at the felt fibers, they are all from pigs. I fear harming life, so I avoid it." Indeed, the woman was originally from a butcher family, so the origin of the felt could be known. Habitually two tigers accompanied him, following on left and right. The Master said to them: "I will not enter towns and cities.

If there is another place suitable for cultivation, guide me there." The tigers traveled thirty li and arrived at a mountain slope, then crouched down and stayed. The Master then hung his staff on tree branches and sat on grass. At this, donors gathered without urging. The thorny area transformed into a jeweled monastery. It was named Geumsan Temple. The Master's final destination later could not be fathomed. In later generations those who admired the Master's style and annually repented sins seeking precepts were extremely numerous.

The eulogy says: "The boundless ocean of karmic obstructions - its shore lies in turning one's head. The dark room of accumulated kalpas - its light lies in a single torch." Master Jinpyo reformed his mind and transformed his conduct with earnest suffering and sincere devotion. Even golden walls and iron ramparts - he necessarily wished to break them open before stopping. Indeed he was moved to see the Lord of Tuṣita Heaven personally stroke his head and confer precepts. How fitting this was! Viewing the various ways others were moved to receive precepts, his seems to surpass them. What the ancients called "one who can illuminate those before him" - the Master possessed this. Alas! Those who delight in learning precepts - observing this, can they not rise up with determination and encourage themselves with vigilance?

**Biography of Vinaya Master Yuanzhen Yi of Chengxin Temple in Yuezhou**
The Vinaya Master's taboo name was Dayi, with Yuanzhen as his courtesy name. He was born to the Xu family of Xiaoshan in Kuaiji. On his birth day there were many divine anomalies. At merely seven years old he was clever, wise, elegant and bright. When his father taught him scriptures, he could memorize thousands of words daily. At age twelve he went to Lingyin Temple in Shanyin to become a novice. When studying the inner teachings, he understood immediately upon opening any text. Everyone marveled at this. In the third year of Jinglong, Emperor Zhongzong issued an edict throughout the realm to test scriptures and ordain monks. The Master tested first and took ordination. He was assigned to Zhaoxuan Temple. Day and night he studied tirelessly. Beyond inner learning he also studied the books of Confucius and Laozi.

In the fifth year of Kaiyuan he received full ordination from Vinaya Master Yuan of Wu Commandery. At that time Vinaya Master Shen of Kaiyuan Temple had a good reputation. The Master entered under him and investigated the *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya*. Before long Shen passed away. He took up his staff to visit Vinaya Master Xuanyan at Fahua. Yan loved his excellence and said to him: "Now for transmitting the Dharma, who else but you?" His reputation became increasingly prominent. Vinaya Master Chao of Chengxin Temple requested him to take temple office. In a certain year his parents died. After the funeral was completed, he entered Buddha Ridge at Tiantai and recited the entire Tripiṭaka to increase merit for the deceased. During Tianbao he built a chamber on the former site of Dunwozhou to dwell - this is North Hollow. Initially he dreamed of two Sanskrit monks who said: "You have a twenty-year karmic connection at this place." When Baoying began, he again dreamed of the former monks who said: "Originally we set twenty years - now it is complete. Demon bandits will arrive - you should leave quickly." Before long the sea bandit Yuan Chao seized Shan County and reached Danqiu. The Master therefore went with Vinaya Master Jiong of Dayu Temple to the dwelling of Venerable Zuoxi to refine and cultivate śamatha-vipaśyanā meditation. At this time the scholar-officials gave their allegiance. Prime Minister Du Hongjian, Minister Xue Jianxun, Censor-in-Chief Shu Gujun, Prefect of Mingzhou Xu Jiao and others all had deep friendship with him. On a certain day of the fifth month of the fourteenth year of Dali he manifested nirvana. At that time heavenly music was heard in his chamber. He lived eighty-nine years and sat for sixty-three summers. His disciples built a stupa at his former dwelling in North Hollow. The Master habitually recited the *Lotus*, *Nirvana*, and greater and lesser precept texts as his primary practice. He ascended ordination platforms twenty-seven times before and after. He ordained a certain number of disciples. Disciples who received precepts totaled over thirty thousand.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Rujing of Anguo Temple in Jingzhao**
The Vinaya Master's name was Rujing. His clan origins and birth circumstances are not detailed. As a person he was intelligent and brilliant, broadly learned in Confucian classics, skilled in calligraphy, and accomplished in literary composition. After donning robes and receiving precepts, he precisely maintained prohibitive and prescriptive practices, never transgressing. Each time he ascended the hall to expound Dharma, followers from the four directions gathered like clouds driven by wind. Previously in the Guanzhong region they practiced Vinaya Master Zhishou's *Commentary on the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya*. Vinaya Master Fali of Wei Commandery composed a separate commentary that circulated independently. There seemed to be slight incompatibilities as well.

**Left Page Lower Section**
In early Tang, Vinaya Master Xuan of Nanshan based his work on Master Shou's great commentary to compose the *Revised Handbook of Practices*. All under Heaven competed to transmit and chant it. Also Vinaya Master Huaisu of Hengji first studied the handbook school, then separately composed *Record of the Opened Dharmaguptaka Vinaya*, called "New Chapters," taking the books of the two masters Li and Xuan as "old commentaries." By the Dali period of Emperor Daizong, old commentaries and new chapters mutually had strengths and weaknesses. In the thirteenth year he summoned vinaya masters of three schools to determine the relative prominence of the two traditions. At that time they promoted the Master as sect leader. By the second year of Jianzhong, achieving the parallel practice of both new and old commentaries was largely due to the Master's efforts.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Jianyuan of Kaizhao Temple in Hanzhou**  
Vinaya Master Jianyuan - it is unknown what his family background was or what country he was from. He had supreme conduct and was able to follow and maintain vinaya standards to serve as an example to later generations, not merely engaging in verbal explanations. However, he was especially accomplished in the comprehensive understanding of the *Avatamsaka*. Each time he lectured, students filled the seats. At the time this was called the "supreme assembly." Moreover, in the granaries there were only a few hundred bushels of rice and grain, yet from summer through autumn, the provisions for morning gruel and noon meals supplied a thousand people daily without ever running short. The temple where he resided had many miraculous signs. There was Chan Master Huiguan, an elder virtue of the temple, who said that every night he would see over three hundred monks holding lotus lanterns clearly crossing through the sky and departing. During Kaiyuan, Duke Cui Ning of Ji suspected this was false and personally spent consecutive nights in the mountains to observe. He also preemptively prohibited making fires within thirty li in all four directions around the mountain. Initially

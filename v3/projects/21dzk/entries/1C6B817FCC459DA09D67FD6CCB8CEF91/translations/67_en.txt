Biography of Kōshō Bodhisattva of Saidaiji in the Southern Capital

The Bodhisattva's personal name was Eizon, with the courtesy name Shien. He was from Minoda village in Soegami district of Yamato Province. His father's surname was Minamoto, who later became a monk with the dharma name Keigen. His mother was of the Fujiwara clan and was also deeply devoted to the Three Treasures. When she was pregnant with the master, her body experienced no distress. He was born auspiciously on a certain day in the 5th month of the 1st year of Kennin (Kanoto-Tori, 1201). As a child he was calm and dignified, not engaging in childish games. His divine nature was brilliant, and he possessed the bearing of mature wisdom. Those with discernment praised and admired him. At age five he developed aspirations to revere the Buddha and had absolutely no interest in worldly matters. When his parents taught him Buddhist scriptures, he could memorize them after a single reading. In the first year of Kenryaku (1211), when the master was eleven years old, he left home and entered Daigoji, paying respects to Monk Eiken as his teacher. He daily offered incense and flowers with utmost care and studied the reading of scriptures and histories, thoroughly understanding their great meanings. At sixteen he returned to his hometown to perform the rites of visiting his parents. Before a full year had passed he returned to Daigoji. He privately reflected: "Among all the myriad beings, obtaining a human body is difficult. Having fortunately become human, to hear the Buddha's true dharma and cultivate realization is even more difficult. I have already obtained birth in the human realm and have encountered the Buddha's true dharma. I should practice according to the teachings and benefit all sentient beings. But I do not know which school I should follow." He then went to Seiryū Shrine to seek divine guidance. After seven full days he had a dream. A divine maiden in beautiful robes and elegant makeup brought food and gave it to him saying: "After you finish eating, go to Kongōōin and bathe."

Upon awakening, he thought that Kongōōin was a sacred place of yoga practice. Based on what he had dreamed, could it be the esoteric school? He then hurried to Nishitani and visited Dharma Master Eshō. Eshō examined his aspirations and told him: "The Shingon gate is like a wonderful medicine of the finest quality that can cure the diseases of the three obstacles of sentient beings. You must make this the ground where your mind dwells." Since Eshō's words matched his previous dream, the master then devoted his heart to the esoteric vehicle and studied the Bodhicitta-śāstra, Siddhaṃ Character Records, and other works. Eventually he received tonsure from Ācārya Enmyō. At this time he was seventeen years old, in the 5th year of Kenpō (1217). Day and night he studied diligently without slacking. Gradually he received the eighteen mudrās and mantras, the great dharmas of both maṇḍalas, and the secret rituals of fire offerings. By chance he climbed Mount Kōya with his staff. There was Ācārya Shinkyō who was refined in esoteric teachings. The master stayed as his disciple and received his explanations. After a long time he took leave of Kyō and met with Ācārya Jōkei of Reizanin. Kei recognized his extraordinary qualities in his countenance and said to him: "You are a great dharma vessel. Take good care of yourself." In the 1st year of Antei (1227), when the master was twenty-seven, he received comprehensive abhiṣeka from Kei. From this point there was nothing in the esoteric school's profound secrets or in the Abhidharmakośa and Vijñānavāda texts that he did not thoroughly understand. One day he struck his desk and sighed: "Among the three studies of the dharma gate, precepts come first. Without precepts there is no meditation; without meditation there is no wisdom. If the roots of precepts are not pure, how can the meditation and wisdom one practices be pure?" He went to see Master Shōshun En at Hōtōin and fully explained his earnest desire to seek vinaya. En praised his aspirations and treated him with great warmth. One evening the master dreamed that a heavenly maiden came bearing an object and gave it to him. The master asked: "What is this object?" She said: "It is a wish-fulfilling jewel." After awakening he joyfully said: "In the future I will bring forth the precept jewel to illuminate humans and devas." He went on an outing to Tōdaiji and relied on the two great elders Chisoku Nyo and Sonshō Jō, listening to the teachings of the Nanzan school. Soon he sighed again: "The great bhikṣu precepts require the assembly of various conditions for the ritual to be accomplished. What can be done about the lack of proper transmission?"

When he discussed and debated the Hyō-muhyō-shō with Vinaya Master Kakujō, he then learned that by relying on the explanations in the Yoga [treatises] and others to take self-vow ordination, each of the seven assemblies could obtain their essence and perfect their nature. Consequently, in the autumn 8th month of the 2nd year of Jōtei (1238), he performed confession dharma at the Vairocana Hall of Tōdaiji. Before long there were auspicious spiritual responses. On the 2nd day of the 9th month he took self-vows and received śrāmaṇera precepts. On the 4th day at noon in the upper period he received full ordination. At this time he was thirty-six years old. The Four Vinayas, Five Treatises, Three Great [Compilations], and Five Sections - he thoroughly mastered each one without any remaining obscurities. In winter, the 12th month, Kaikeishō invited the master using Kairyūōji Temple. The master went gladly. Daily he opened his crimson silk curtains and lectured on the school's teachings. All the black-robed scholars bowed their heads and listened. In the 1st year of Rekinin (1238) he accepted an invitation to reside at Saidaiji. On the 28th day of the 10th month of winter, he established boundaries according to dharma, invited Vinaya Master Kakujō to perform the karma ceremony, and the master conducted the chanting. The next day they first performed the Dharmaguptaka assembly dharma poṣadha. After two summers and winters, they also performed the assembly dharma pravāraṇā. All the pure regulations of the vinaya garden were carried out in order. Staff-bearing monks came flocking like butterflies, and his virtuous reputation spread far and wide. Even three-foot-tall children could know his name. In the 3rd year of Kangen (1245) he went to Hokkeji Temple. Nun Bunkyō and others received śrāmaṇerī precepts from the master. In autumn, the 9th month, he reached Ieharadera in Izumi. Following the separate ordination dharma with four-fold karma, he again received full ordination. He also went to Hokkeji Temple and lectured on the Bhikṣuṇī Commentary for the assembly, conferring śikṣamāṇā precepts on several people including so-and-so. In the first year of Kenchō (1249) he conferred great bhikṣuṇī precepts on twelve people including Jizen. Through this all seven assemblies were complete. He also accepted a request from the assembly to lecture on the Jicho at Hokkeji Temple. Over two thousand relics appeared on his desk. Blue and yellow intermixed, their light was dazzling. People of the time called them

"emerged relics." Soon he went to Kawachi Province and established boundaries at Shinfukuji. After two years he lectured on the Brahmajāla at Shitennōji in Settsu. The audience numbered over twenty thousand, all outstanding individuals of the time. In the first year of Bun'ō (1260), Middle Counselor Sadatsugu took tonsure and received full ordination from the master, taking the name Jōnen. He newly established a monastery and invited the master to be its founding patriarch. The master then established monastic boundaries and named it Jōjū. In spring of the following year, 2nd month, Great Patron and Governor of Echizen Taira Sanetoki invited the master to come to Kamakura. His cordial inquiries were most considerate. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Tokiyori received the great bodhisattva precepts and conducted himself with the courtesy of a disciple. He then donated several hundred acres of estate land to support provisions. The master declined and would not accept. When he returned, the commander sent letters inquiring after his health. In spring, 2nd month of the 3rd year of Bun'ei (1266), while at Shitennōji, he preached dharma for the assembly. People saw the master manifest Buddha-body and emit great radiance. In the 4th year he restored Hannyaji Temple. The Buddha hall, monks' quarters, ornate towers, and kitchen were completed in sequence. The brilliant colors illuminated the surrounding forests and peaks. He had his disciple Jidō Kū reside in that position. In spring, 3rd month of the 5th year he held a great unrestricted assembly. Tens of thousands of hungry people received his benevolence and departed. In winter, 11th month of the following year, while traveling he reached Takayasu District in Kawachi Province. The district had a temple called Kyōkō that had been ruined for a long time. The master was deeply moved and saddened. He coordinated collective efforts to completely renovate it. In the 8th year at Saidaiji he held a relic assembly for seven days and nights. Relic pearls appeared on the altar platform - probably over four thousand. The master found this wondrous and stored them in jade bottles as precious treasures of the temple. Retired Emperor Gofukakusa heard of the master's reputation and issued an edict summoning him to the imperial palace. The master strenuously declined. When the edict came three times he had no choice but to enter for an audience. The retired emperor granted him a seat and questioned him about dharma. The master's replies were fitting to the imperial intention. The imperial mood was pleased and delighted, and he then received the precept dharma.

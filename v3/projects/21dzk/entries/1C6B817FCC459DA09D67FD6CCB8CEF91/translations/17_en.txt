Afterward, his vinaya practice was precise and clear, his bearing composed and upright. It happened that Vinaya Master Daoyun was promoting the vinaya, so the Master hastily went to study under him, receiving intimate instruction for the longest time. He thus became his successor. Later when he manifested in the world at Xiangzhou, at one time people came flocking like clouds and rain with bamboo hats, bustling about. Many reached seven hundred people. The Master did not refuse them but received them all according to their spiritual capacity. He greatly proclaimed Master Yun's Way—not only vinaya disciples looked up to his transformation, but even those called venerable elders among sutra and treatise scholars all took refuge under his teaching, looking up to his moral influence and taking it as their standard. The Master's flourishing virtue can be generally seen by examining this one aspect. Later his final end is not detailed. He once compiled a *Dharmaguptaka Commentary* in a certain number of volumes, which was valued at the time. His foremost dharma successor was Vinaya Master Hongfu Shou.

Praise says: The Way of Fami was transmitted six generations to reach Daoyun. Master Hong was Yun's legitimate heir who did not let fall his spiritual father's tradition. He greatly proclaimed the vinaya, causing vinaya disciples to converge abundantly, and even scholars of sutras and treatises all entered his gate. How flourishing this was! The *Poetry* says: "Luxuriant are the yu and pu trees—gather them for firewood, cut them for fuel." Is this not what is meant?

**Right Page Lower Section**
The Vinaya Master's name was Juelang. His lay surname is not detailed. He was a person of Hedong. His spiritual bearing was refined and bright, his moral character surpassed others. After shaving his head and receiving ordination, he resided at Daxingshan Temple. He thoroughly understood the *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya* and was also versed in the *Mahāparinirvāṇa*. During the Renshou period, Emperor Wen commanded monks who understood dharma characteristics and were capable of propagation to distribute relics and send them to famous monasteries, erecting pagodas to enshrine them. The Master was also selected for this and went to Juecheng Temple in Jiangzhou. When entering the temple, he displayed the relics to monks and laypeople. Suddenly they emerged from a golden vase and divided into seven parts. Their light blazed brilliantly, piercing and illuminating the four directions. When they dug the foundation two *zhang* deep, they obtained one *sheng* of millet. They also experienced a yellow sparrow that was not afraid when people approached, taming circling the Buddha tower for a long time before disappearing by itself. They also saw two bodhisattvas manifesting forms above a stone casket, with a nun in front bowing respectfully with folded hands. Additionally they saw flying immortals, unicorns, phoenixes, yellow sparrows, twin trees, and other manifestations. For the three days before enshrinement, the golden light became increasingly brilliant, causing day and night to become indistinguishable. Countless eyes gazed in admiration, considering it unprecedented. At the end of the Daye era, he received imperial command to reside at Dachanding Temple and propagate the essential teachings. Students joyfully followed him like multitudes of streams flowing toward a great river. In his declining years he died at the original temple. His lifespan is not detailed.

**Biography of Two Vinaya Masters Haizang and Faqiang of the Sui**
The Vinaya Master's name was Haizang. His understanding and faith were firm and upright, taking the vinaya as his ultimate goal. He frequently lectured on the *Dharmaguptaka*, and his honorable reputation was widespread. When the Tang dynasty established the Ten Great Elders, the Master was actually included among them. The Vinaya Master's name was Faqiang. Initially he practiced the Dharma of Fajing, and after a long time flew his staff to Yamato, wearing his *kaṣāya* among mists, clouds, springs, and rocks, taking mind-contemplation as his urgent task. After his death, his body was exposed in the mountain wilderness, but at night there was a sacred lamp whose light flickered brilliantly. When monks and laypeople went to observe it, it would disappear, but when viewed from afar it could be seen again. After two months the illumination became increasingly bright. People of the time transmitted this as a miraculous

event.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Huizhu of Xianglin Temple, Shizhou, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Huizhu, of the Jia clan, a person of Yonggui County in Shizhou. His outstanding hereditary nature emerged naturally. At the mere age of six, he resolutely left the secular world and reverently made Master Bin his teacher. When the Dharma Master taught him the *Testament*, he could immediately memorize it. Without delay he entered under Vinaya Master Jiang's teaching circle to receive instruction. Regarding the *Lotus Sutra* he was also able to accomplish recitation. In the eastern quarters of the temple there was someone lecturing on secular law. The Master tried listening and understood its essential meaning as if he had long been familiar with it. He then posed ten questions that no one could answer. When he reached the age of twenty, he went to Ganlu Temple in the capital to receive full ordination. He concentrated on the *Dharmaguptaka* while also studying various texts comprehensively. Men and women, both dark-skinned and light-skinned, all bowed in reverence, following the prevailing influence and seeking the Way from him. One night the Master had a dream: for three days and three nights heaven and earth were in darkness, sentient beings lost their eyes, then returned to normal. Upon awakening his whole body was covered in sweat, not knowing what this meant. After one hundred days Zhou destroyed the Buddhist path, and then he understood it was a prophetic response. He immediately concealed his traces in the Southern Mountains. Drinking from streams and eating vegetables, he lived there comfortably. Different species of birds and beasts became naturally tame without reason, none daring to cause harm. Sometimes mountain spirits offered *Poria cocos* and sweet pine incense. Sometimes during the six-period practice, birds and beasts would follow along, reverencing Buddha and reciting sutras as if with the intention of listening respectfully. He continued to confer bodhisattva precepts for both the visible and invisible realms. Later there were macaques that gathered in groups to open roads. The Master said: "Your nature is restless and disturbing. What are you doing this for?" They said: "The temporal ruler is different. The Buddha-sun penetrates." After a short while auspicious dragons soared gracefully and fragrant vapors filled the mountain. Soon there was a divine person who calmly said to the Master: "A sage ruler has appeared in the world, with the era name Kaihuang." The Master was deeply puzzled and immediately came out to reach the capital. Indeed the Sui had

received the Zhou abdication and Buddhism was greatly propagated. He then memorialized these events and was permitted to join the monastic order. During the Daye period he received imperial command to head Xianglin Temple in his home province. He constantly made promoting the *Dharmaguptaka* his occupation. At the beginning of Wude, Duke Lingyang governed Yizhou. Having little faith by nature, he brought over a hundred pack-loads of goods, traveled to Shizhou, and entered the temple to store them in the Buddha hall, lecture hall, and monks' quarters. None dared oppose this. The Master returned from the estate and saw this defilement and contamination. He immediately entered his quarters, took his staff and three robes, came out and sighed: "Life and death are decided today!" He raised his staff toward the donkeys and mules, and they all immediately fell prostrate as if dead. The Master lifted one pack-load in each hand and threw them into a pit. The county officials were greatly alarmed and seized the Master to file a report. Lingyang was delighted and said: "The Vinaya Master has broken my stinginess and greed—this is greatly beneficial!" He immediately presented him with ten *jin* of aloes wood and ten bolts of silk. Later when returning to the capital, he received bodhisattva precepts from him. He passed away without illness on a certain day of a certain month in the third year of Zhenguan. His worldly lifespan was eighty-nine years, his monastic years sixty-nine. Throughout his life the Master delighted in creating merit. He once built monasteries in the counties of Huang'an, Zitong, and Wulian—about twenty locations in total. They were all completed in an instant.

Praise says: Master Zhu secluded himself in the Southern Mountains where spiritual anomalies were manifest and clear. Sometimes mountain spirits offered incense, sometimes macaques practiced the Way, sometimes auspicious dragons soared with fragrant vapors filling the mountain, sometimes divine beings appeared to announce the sage emperor's accession to the throne. Such cases as these are more than one could enumerate. Alas, these were still just the surplus threads of the Master's Way. Yet without planting stones to have jade grow, how would one know his filial devotion?

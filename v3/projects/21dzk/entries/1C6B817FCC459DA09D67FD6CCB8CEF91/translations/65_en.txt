Thus there were those who assisted and supported his transformative work from the time of their descent into this world. How could this not be truly believable? Moreover, Master Chikyō crossed seas and traversed deserts, seeking only the Way. Without the utmost sincerity and firm resolve, this would not have been possible. One can truly say "having such a father, there is such a son."

**Biography of Two Dharma Masters: Gaen and Rishō**
The Dharma Master's name was Shi'in, courtesy name Gaen. He received teachings from the National Master of True Dharma and also followed Dharma Master Jōjun, further investigating the sectarian principles. Later he succeeded to the seat of Dharma Master Getsuō and resided at Sennyū, using the Way of vinaya to instruct scholars. He entered extinction on the 12th day of the 11th month of a certain year. The Dharma Master's name was Dōgen, courtesy name Rishō. He became a disciple of Dharma Master Jōjun. From after taking the tonsure, he had aspirations for distant travel. At one point he sailed across the sea and entered Song China, received dharma transmission and returned. Through this his dharma reputation daily increased, and the four assemblies looked up to him with reverence. His end is not detailed. There exists one volume of "Commentary on the Bhikṣuṇī Summary."

**Biography of Dharma Master Bun'yō Tankai**
The Dharma Master's name was Tankai, courtesy name Bun'yō. It is unknown from where he came. He was a disciple of the National Master of True Dharma. From youth he was brilliant and outstanding, surpassing his peers. After becoming a monk, he traveled throughout the four directions studying vinaya. At the end of Kajō era, arousing the aspiration to seek the dharma, he crossed the sea and entered Song China. He traveled through both eastern and western Zhejiang, and his learning increasingly advanced. At Bailian Temple there was one Buddha tooth stored in a precious casket and kept secret in the inner courtyard. The master, hearing of this, especially went to pay reverent respects. His divine countenance was dignified and solemn, as if the Dharmakāya were present. The master generated thoughts of this rare encounter. When he inquired of the temple monks, they said: "This is the true bodily tooth of Śākyamuni Tathāgata." After returning to his country, he constantly kept the Buddha tooth in his thoughts.

Moreover, he had the aspiration to restore Bailian Temple. He then consulted with virtuous laypeople, selected fine timber and loaded it on ships. He went again to that temple and commissioned craftsmen to undertake the construction. The halls were completed in no time. The entire assembly was moved with gratitude, regretting only that they had no way to repay his virtue. The master said to Elder Jian: "I have something I hope for." The elder said: "I wish to hear it." The master said: "I wish to respectfully take this Buddha tooth back to Japan and forever treasure and offer it to bring blessings to the people of our country." The elder gladly gave it to him. The master was greatly pleased and personally carried it to Xia Tianzhu Temple. Elder Guyun Cui obtained the opportunity for reverent worship and was overcome with joy and emotion. He recorded in detail its origins for the master and composed a eulogy saying: "Like the Fengcheng sword whose spirit pierces the Ox and Dipper constellations, like the Hepu pearl whose light penetrates the heart of waves - how can they compare to the true relics of the sage, illuminating dark crossroads through countless kalpas of dust motes." Thereupon he respectfully brought the Buddha tooth back to his country and permanently enshrined it at Sennyū. Every year on the 8th day of the 9th month a relic assembly is held. This continues to this day. Country people who participate in the merit-making line up their shoes along the road. The master demonstrated passing away on the 24th day of the 12th month of a certain year. Initially when he was at Sennyū, the assembly nominated him and appointed him to the position of head seat.

The eulogy states: After the Tathāgata's transformative authority was completed, he concealed his radiance among the twin trees. He again transformed into śarīra, causing light to flow and auspicious signs to appear, forever serving as a field of merit for humans and devas. Therefore the Buddha said: "After my extinction, if there are people who even offer to my relics the size of mustard seeds, revering and honoring them, humbly making offerings, I declare that such people through these good roots will all attain the realm of nirvana and exhaust the limits of nirvana." For this reason, Dharma Master Tankai twice trod the whale waves of ten thousand li, obtained the Buddha tooth at Bailian, installed it at Sennyū, thereby bringing blessed protection to Japan. What was the extent of his compassionate heart and burning devotion? Up to now, more than four hundred years later, the incense and offerings

have not ceased. Among clergy and laity who pay reverent respects, there are none who do not joyfully feel moved and increase their virtuous intentions. Who could forget the virtue of Master Tankai?

**Biography of Dharma Master Saisa Jōin of Kaikō Temple**
The Dharma Master's name was Jōin, courtesy name Eng'o. He took the title Saisa. From where he came is not detailed. He was born in the 5th year of Kenpō, year of the metal ox (1217). His natural endowment was extraordinary, brilliant and penetratingly clear. After becoming a monk he studied under Dharma Master Donshō of Kaikō Temple. Having already received his dharma, he further entered the gates of Dharma Masters Jōjun and Chikyō, increasingly penetrating their subtle teachings. Moreover, he concurrently investigated sūtras and śāstras and mastered Confucian classics. Through this his dharma reputation was valued in vinaya circles. Donshō, recognizing that his learning was accomplished and virtue established, entrusted Tōrin Temple to the master to represent him in spreading the teachings. Initially, many of the founding master's doctrinal texts had been scattered and destroyed. Although the Song printed Three Great Compilations still existed, their circulation was not yet widespread. The master then added Japanese readings and had them printed for transmission. Was not his merit great? In the 1st year of Shōgen, year of earth and sheep (1259), he received Donshō's instructions and filled the seat of Kaikō Temple. He ascended the seat to expound the dharma, moving the hearts of beings. Dharma Master Enshō of the southern capital, valuing the master's Way, invited him to Kaidanin to lecture on vinaya. Many outstanding figures of the time flocked to his assembly. Afterward he returned to his home temple. Later he went to Sagami Province and founded a temple called Hanzan as a sub-temple of Kaikō Temple. Thus the sectarian tradition of vinaya flourished in the Kantō region. His transformative work having reached completion, he grew weary of social obligations and departed this world on the 11th day of the 12th month of the 8th year of Bun'ei (1271). He reached the age of fifty-five. His monastic years were such-and-such number. The books he composed and compiled in his lifetime were very numerous. His excellent virtue and lofty conduct closely approached those of the Great Wisdom Dharma Master. People all called him "Great Wisdom reborn." His disciples included Butsuji and several dozen others.

The two masters maintained his seat and did not let the family reputation decline. Their virtue and fame spread throughout the Kansai region.

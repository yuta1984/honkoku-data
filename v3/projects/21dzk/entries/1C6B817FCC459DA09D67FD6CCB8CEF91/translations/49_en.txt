How much time could one obtain?" Therefore he went to Wenzhou and entered Kaiyuan Temple to become a monk. During the Longji era he received full ordination. It happened that Vinaya Master Huize of Ximing was staying at Mount Tiantai. The Master went and relied upon him. Morning and evening he consulted and inquired, finally exhausting all the subtle principles of that tradition. He also studied Confucian classics and grasped the essentials of the *Book of Changes*. When Ze passed away, he opened [teachings of] the dharma at Yongjia. Qian Hua, the youngest brother of King Wu Su of the Qian clan, was then governing this commandery and deeply showed reverence and respect. When someone falsely accused him of minor transgressions, the Master brushed off his robes and moved to Daqian Temple in Qiantang. King Wenmu invited the Master to head the new monastery of Qianfo. He privately conferred upon him the title Great Master Wenguang. Scholars from all directions gathered and turned toward his transformative influence. It was no less than the *udumbara* flower appearing once in the world. The Master, due to old age and illness, requested to resign from his position. He lived freely in mountain retreats, taking joy in the Way itself. Was this not because he was weary of reputation and status becoming burdens? One day he had a slight illness and repeatedly saw divine beings attending and protecting him. The Master gave away his robes and possessions, making offerings to the monks present. He also provided a universal meal for all monks in the city. Having finished entrusting his final affairs, he peacefully transformed. He lived eighty-five years. His monastic years were several decades. His writings include "Augmenting Radiance Commentary on the Shizhichao" in twenty fascicles, "Simulated Slanderous Writings of Jiangdong" in five fascicles, "Miscellaneous Poems and Rhapsodies" in fifteen fascicles, "Comprehensive Commentary on the Book of Changes" in twenty fascicles, "Annotated Ancient Poem of One Hundred Rhymes on Jinling by Lin Ding," and "Miscellaneous Forms" in forty chapters. The Master was also one of the sixty [great vinaya masters].

**Praise says:** From Jingxiao to these several masters, all were able to establish teachings and illuminate the ancestral model. Though among them there could not but be differences in excellence, their sincerity in propagating the school was without exception the same. They were indeed the outstanding talents of their time.

**Biography of Great Master Zhenfa of Xiangguo Temple, Zhou**

**Right Page Lower Section**
The Great Master was named Chengchu, surname Zong. His native place has not been investigated. His mother Lady Zhao, when pregnant with the Master, was always able to maintain purity and cleanliness. When she gave birth, strange light blazed brilliantly and filled the room. Neighbors were startled and amazed. His physical appearance was remarkably intelligent, different from ordinary children. At age seven he happened to enter a temple and see Buddha statues, whereupon he sighed in admiration and prostrated. Returning home he asked his father: "That [being] with golden physical characteristics sitting upon a lotus flower—is it only Buddha who is thus? Can others also be like this or not?" His father said: "All sentient beings with consciousness can attain Buddhahood, how much more humans?" The Master joyfully wished to become a monk. At age ten he became a disciple of Master Zhiming at Xiangguo Temple. At that time there were children who gathered to play and invited him to join. The Master said: "Those who have left home study the unconditioned dharma. Would they instead use frivolous games to disturb their minds?" Those with insight found this remarkable, saying: "This child will surely become a great vessel of the dharma school in the future." After receiving full ordination he studied the Xinzhang [vinaya]. He alone was able to deeply penetrate the profound mysteries of the Vinaya. Moreover his eloquent arguments were sharp and keen; none of his contemporaries could challenge him. He was therefore nicknamed "Vinaya Tiger." Princes and great men who came to his door seeking instruction were daily numerous. Emperor Gaozu of Jin, hearing of the Master's reputation for the Way, issued an edict summoning him to the inner palace assembly. He bestowed upon him the *sanghati* robe and conferred the title Great Master Zhenfa, appointing him as patriarch of the Xinzhang Vinaya school. All imperial consorts and princesses who entered the Way were commanded to receive precepts from the Master. On the twelfth day of the tenth month of the sixth year of Xiande, with his head facing north and face toward the west, he passed away without illness. His worldly age was seventy-one, his monastic summers fifty. His disciples cremated him according to dharma and obtained several relics. They constructed a brick pagoda to enshrine them. The monks and nuns he ordained numbered over eight thousand. Those who received his dharma included Huizhao and several others. Wujiao, the head seat of the left street, composed a "Record of the Relics Pagoda."

**Praise says:** Formerly when Dharma Master Xuanzang was a child, seeing various *shramanera* engaging in frivolous talk and playful antics, he said: "Does not the sutra say that those who leave home are for the unconditioned dharma? How could they again engage in childish games? This can be called vainly wasting a hundred years." Observing Master Chu's words in childhood, they were not inferior to Master Zang. He eventually became a great teacher of his generation and spread his fragrance through a thousand ages. This was not by chance. Today's "crow-drivers" who eat their fill, engage in frivolous chatter, and bury themselves in the months and years—hearing this, do they ever feel ashamed?

**Biography of the Two Vinaya Masters Farong and Chuyun, Song**
Vinaya Master Farong—his family name is not detailed. As a person he was intelligent and keen, his spiritual acuity outstanding and transcendent. Having accomplished leaving home, he soon received the precept grades. He went to Vinaya Master Wuwai and received instruction. In all sections of the Vinaya he achieved wonderful penetration of the subtle and profound. Though there were many heroes outside the school, there were rarely any who surpassed him. He thus became his [Wuwai's] direct successor. Later he occupied a famous monastery and his reputation flourished; both clergy and laity looked up to him. Masters like Puji, Deming, Hongxin, and Wen Nai all came from his school. Later where he died is unknown. Vinaya Master Chuyun received dharma from Vinaya Master Rong. He was intelligent, perceptive, and quick, cultivated the Nanshan school teachings, compiled the "Supplementary Records" to explain the *Shizhichao*. The Master was also one of the sixty [great vinaya masters]. He had one primary dharma heir named Vinaya Master Zewu.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Puji, Song**
Vinaya Master Puji of Yuezhou was a disciple of Vinaya Master Farong. His profound talent was heaven-born, his learning excellent and abundant. He especially devoted attention to the *Shizhichao*, composing "Collected Explanations Commentary" in twelve fascicles to explain it. The Master was also one of the sixty [great vinaya masters].

He was broadly versed in the Three Treasures, especially proficient in Nanshan Vinaya. Whenever he engaged in discussion with people, his eloquent arguments were grand and expansive; those who encountered his intellectual prowess were immediately defeated.

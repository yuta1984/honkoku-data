this is unavoidable. Alas! Those who do not examine themselves yet entrust themselves to the ancient sages are like trying to paint a tiger but failing and creating a dog instead. The Patriarch's words say: "People today are attached to the world, accumulating material goods and following their greedy feelings. When have they ever yearned for the Way? They misuse the sacred teachings and deceive the ignorant. Even a cup of water or a thread of clothing mentioned in the Buddha Treasury cannot be digested [karmically]. How can the mediocre and foolish presume to equal the traces of the exalted? Have you also not heard this?"

Our Master was Gong's spiritual grandson. He thoroughly investigated the essential doctrines and maintained them with particular strictness.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Zhijing Yunwen of Jinglin Temple**
The Vinaya Master's taboo name was Yunwen, Zhijing was his courtesy name. He was born to the Zhu family of Jiiahe in Xiuzhou. At the age of nine, his father fell ill and was dying. He called him and enjoined: "After I close my eyes, you should immediately become a monk. Do not remain attached to secular life." The Master then took refuge with a certain elder as a novice. He was taught the Lotus Sutra and Vimalakirti Sutra. After two full years, he mastered their sentence structure and meaning. Someone jokingly asked the Master: "After you receive ordination, what do you plan to do?" The Master immediately responded: "I shall sit upon the lotus throne and make the lion's roar." Those with insight said: "This child has great aspirations. His future will not be easy to predict." At sixteen he cut his hair, then ascended Mount Song and received full ordination from Master Yuan. At that time he was already twenty-three. Thereupon he devoted himself to studying the Sarvastivada Vinaya and also investigated the Madhyamaka treatise. Through four changes of seasons, there was nothing in the mysterious paths of precepts and transformative teachings whose essence he did not grasp and whose quintessence he did not absorb. In the fifth year of Taihe he returned to his native place. Soon hearing that Tianzhu Temple in Qiantang was lecturing on the Nirvana Sutra, he went there to listen. In the first year of Kaicheng, he traveled east to Taitai and stayed at Jiaxiang Temple in Yue. The four assemblies requested him to lecture on sutras and vinaya. He constantly urged and encouraged his listeners, his words being particularly intense and pointed. There was none among the listeners who did not shed tears and reform their hearts and conduct. In the third year of Huichang, he moved to reside at Jinglin Temple, specializing

in propagating the Nirvana [teachings]. When Emperor Wuzong abolished the teachings, he consequently wore Confucian robes during the day and monastic robes at night, waiting for times to change. When the dharma was restored in the first year of Dazhong, he was registered at Kaiyuan Temple. In the seventh year he became an elder of the temple and elucidated the essentials of vinaya. In the third year of Qianfu, he ceased lecturing and studied the entire canon. On the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month of the second year of Zhonghe, illness arose and he passed away. His worldly age was seventy-eight, his monastic years fifty-five. On the twelfth day of the seventh month of that year he was buried on the southern slope of Mount Shiqi. The Master's observance was meticulous and precise, his deportment stern and orderly. His appearance was imposing and majestic, standing out distinctly like a towering mountain facing the sea. Whenever he ascended the seat and took up the whisk, his disciples showed respectful awe. This was sufficient to perceive what he maintained. In total he lectured on the vinaya commentary twenty-seven times and on the Great Sutra twenty-five times. He regularly read Confucian texts and particularly loved literary composition. On peaceful days he emulated the Grand Tutor Bai [Juyi], personally composing his tomb inscription and storing it in his boxes. His disciple Huaiyi later saw this and was moved to sadness, so he built a small stupa, inscribed the epitaph upon it, and placed it beside [the tomb].

He extensively studied Confucian texts, but this was not what his nature delighted in. In the seventh year of Dazhong, he went to Ximing Temple in the capital and was ordained.

He fled the disorders to Xiagui in Huazhou. Gao Pian of Huainan requested him to open lectures at Fayun Temple. Soon after he took leave. The four assemblies earnestly urged him to stay and teach. Prefect Yang was also particularly earnest. He firmly declined all and then traveled east, hanging his staff at Guoqing Temple of Tiantai. In the first year of Qianning he arrived at Yuwang Temple in Yin. King Wu Su of the Qian family admired the Master's reputation and invited him to preside over ordinations in Yuezhou.

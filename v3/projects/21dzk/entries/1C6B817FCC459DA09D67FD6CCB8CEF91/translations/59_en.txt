Its widespread circulation in our country was due to the master's efforts. The master would say daily: "To become a sage one must rely on upholding precepts." He regularly recited the *Brahmajāla Sūtra*, his voice melodious and clear like playing reed pipes, delighting the hearts of the assembly. There was one called Gyōhyō, a renowned monk of the time. Though older than the master, he humbled himself for the dharma and received the precepts anew. The master praised his aspiration and transmitted the chan teachings to him. Later he moved to Genkōji Temple. He wrote the *Brahmajāla Commentary* in three volumes, which scholars praised. His dharma-heir disciples included Zenshun and several others. Minister Kibi no Mabi was on friendly terms with the master during his lifetime. After the master's death, he composed his biographical record.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Hōshin of Nanto Precept Platform Cloister**
The vinaya master's name was Hōshin, a person from China with the surname Wang. He was a high disciple of Great Master Jianzhen. By nature intelligent and possessing lofty aspirations, after shaving his head and receiving full ordination, he mastered the Three Piṭakas. He particularly excelled in the Tiantai and Vinaya schools and also studied Confucian classics. He emerged at Baita Temple in Yangzhou, guiding through vinaya and revered by the four assemblies. In the fifth year of Tenpyō-shōhō of our country, when the great master crossed eastward, he brought the master along. Retired Emperor Shōmu praised the master's demeanor and favored him exceptionally. When the great master built the precept platform, he commanded the master to preside over ordinations. Through this his reputation for the Way flourished daily. Soon he received imperial decree to become Great Monk Director. The great master vacated the Precept Platform Cloister and commanded the master to reside there. He constantly lectured on major and minor sections of vinaya teachings: the *Brahmajāla Commentary*, *Precept Text Commentary*, *Karmavācanā Commentary*, *Administrative Extracts*, *Bhikṣuṇī Extracts*, *Collected Vinaya Meanings*, and vinaya commentaries by Huiguang, Zhishou, Fazhen and others. He also accepted invitations to lecture on the three major works of the Tiantai school four times. Students flocked to him. Empress Kōken also deeply revered him. When Retired Emperor Shōmu passed away, she decreed that the master conduct Buddhist ceremonies. He passed away in the ninth year of Hōki.

His dharma-heir disciples were extremely numerous, with Shōichi and Ezan as the foremost. The master once went to Tado District in Sanuki Province and lodged at a house. That night he heard from a neighboring house the sound of an infant reciting the Buddha-Crown Mantra, but the family initially didn't realize this and thought it was crying. The master found this strange and wanting to know the reason, stayed for two consecutive nights. Each night he heard the mantra recitation as before. At daybreak he went to that house and pointing to the parents said: "This child is not ordinary. Watch over him well. In the future he will surely propagate the great dharma." Later this proved true—this was Kūkai, Great Master Kōbō. How extraordinary!

Jō additionally studied the Tiantai school and possessed heaven-sent skill and ingenuity. Together with Master Shitaku they created a sixteen-foot Vairocana statue to enshrine in Tōshōdai's main hall. Its sacred features were dignified and strict, inspiring reverence in viewers. That statue exists to this day. Initially when in Tang, he taught dharma at Chaogong Temple in Quanzhou.

he arrived, his reputation and influence grew daily. Vinaya Master Dōsen, knowing that the master particularly excelled in vinaya, had his disciples study under the master. The master opened lecture seats at Daianji Temple for several years. From various texts like the *Fazhen Commentary* and *Zhenguo Record* to Tiantai teachings, his lectures never ceased. None from far and near failed to respectfully admire his moral influence. During the Tenpyō-hōji years, when the great master newly opened Tōshōdai Temple, the master supported the teaching methods and promoted this Way. After the great master's death, he wrote the *Eastern Crossing Biography* to record his excellent conduct and fine virtue. The details of his end are not known.

They shared equal fame in their time. Later they supported the great master in traveling to teach in this land, greatly expanding his Way.

taught with vinaya instruction without change. Jō additionally excelled in Tiantai teachings; when in Tang he taught dharma at Kaiyuan Temple in Douzhou.

**Praise says:** Masters like Hōshin down to Eken came personally from Jianzhen's forge and bellows. Like refined pure gold they had virtually no impurities. How regrettable that among monks there was no Dong Hu [honest historian], so their deeds and traces were lost. What I transmit here is only approximate. Alas, how pitiful!

**Biography of Two Vinaya Masters Eiei and Fushō**
The two vinaya masters Eiei and Fushō were firm and steadfast by nature, able to endure hardship and suffering. Eiei resided at Kōfukuji Temple, Fushō dwelt at Daianji Temple. Each promoted transformative influence. In the fifth year of Tenpyō, carrying Emperor Shōmu's imperial edict, they boarded ships to enter Tang. They visited various great elders and received full ordination from Vinaya Master Dingbin. Over ten years they thoroughly mastered vinaya texts. Subsequently they met Great Master Jianzhen at Daming Temple, fully conveyed the emperor's intention, and requested eastern crossing to spread the teaching. The great master, seeing their sincere earnestness, agreed. In the second year of Tianbao they raised sail and crossed the sea. Midway they lacked water and the entire ship worried anxiously. One night Eiei had a dream where a strange person requested the precept ceremony. After completion he said: "The ship lacks water—I wish to provide it." The strange person then brought water to Eiei. When Eiei drank it the taste was extremely sweet, and his body and mind became clear and cool. Again the strange person called out "Rain!" At daybreak dark clouds suddenly arose and sweet rain fell heavily. The entire ship received relief. Was this not due to the power of the Way? Because Eiei had endured hundreds of sufferings over several years of eating wind and sleeping on water, he eventually contracted illness. One day he said to the great master: "This illness will certainly not recover. Originally I wanted to assist the master in spreading the teaching, but my life will not reach my aspirations. I pray the preceptor will propagate the vinaya teaching."

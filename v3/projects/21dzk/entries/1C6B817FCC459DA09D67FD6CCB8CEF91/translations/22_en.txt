exist only in Śūnyata (Subhūti). The sage established excellent regulations not for self-binding purposes. Though I am untalented, I request to follow this elegant teaching." That very day he went to apologize, cast aside his public reputation, wrapped himself in coarse robes and departed. Some in the community tried to stop him. The Master said: "I do not cling to staying or leaving." He departed to travel to various famous sites including Wutai, Taiyue, Dongchuan, Beibu, Changshan, and Yanmen. For him, a thousand *li* was merely the space of a short step. He also entered Mount Ji to visit the traces of Chaofu and Xu You. Loving the deep tranquility of its forests and springs, he dwelt alone in a thatched hut, engaging in contemplative cultivation. For over thirty years his feet never descended to the valley. Scholars who admired his style would always gather around him in the empty, desolate shores. In the first month of the nineteenth year of Zhenguan, he initially took ill, and on the fifteenth day he sat upright and announced his passing. He lived to eighty-six years. His monastic years are uncertain. The Master's vinaya studies were extremely diligent - he read through the *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya* and other vinayas nearly several hundred times.

Praise says: Master Jin entered the Way steadily with his sharp awakening faculties. Examining his entire life, he cast off worldly concerns and was never bound by floating burdens. Like a soaring dragon or leaping phoenix that cannot be bridled or chained - how could he be like a fly soiled by sleep? His seated passing truly had its reasons.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Mingzan of Fazhu Temple, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Mingzan, from Luzhou. The records have lost his family name. His spirit of refined clarity had abundant surplus. When placed among equals, he was like seeing a crane among chickens. Though he studied broadly in the vinaya section, he particularly found meaning in the *Dharmaguptaka*. When residing at Fazhu Temple, he guided the community and explained the Dharma. In the four prefectures of Han, Lu, Qin, and Ze, none failed to follow his transformation. He once composed *Transmission Commentary* in several volumes.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Daoliang of Yixing Temple, Bingzhou, Tang**
The Vinaya Master was born to the Zhao family, named Daoliang, from Luancheng in Zhaozhou. From childhood he was exceptionally talented and deeply detested worldly dust. In his learning years, he honored Master Shatanbei of his prefecture's border as his teacher, serving him longest in attendance. Later he resided on Mount Fenglong with thirty mountain companions, all engaged in meditation and chanting. There were originally few lay attendants, so the Master daily separated and hulled rice, using five *dou* as his measure. During six years he never became lazy or negligent. For three years he went barefoot and followed the community through the six periods. At that time Master Zan of Bingbu raised high the Dharma banner and his transformative voice spread in four directions. The Master went directly to follow him and then received full ordination. Throughout the twelve periods, he made meditation his sole task. Subsequently he relied on Vinaya Master Yan at Wuliangshou Temple, exclusively studying the *Dharmaguptaka*, never abandoning it day or night. When Yan moved to Shizhou, the Master also attended him. He listened to the *Bodhisattvabhūmi Śāstra* and deeply grasped its profound meaning. He immediately gave review lectures for the community. His mental sharpness was keen and penetrating - none dared oppose him. There was a Confucian scholar named Yuan Xiucai who thoroughly studied Confucian texts and whose talent and wisdom surpassed others. He entered under the Master's instruction and inquired about the meaning of Aśvaghoṣa's *Awakening of Faith*. The Master used unobstructed eloquence to guide him point by point, and he eventually turned his mind and took refuge. When Emperor Tang began his rule and established Yixing Temple, he invited the Master to be its founding patriarch. He greatly promoted transformative authority and his reputation was revered throughout that time. During the Zhenguan period he returned to his home country to visit Master Bei. He was ordered to divide the lecture seat and expound the Dharma. His reputation was heard in court and countryside, with eight hundred listeners. Daily requests for instruction flourished. Later, where he ended is not detailed.

Praise says: Master Liang operated the well and mortar, managed cooking without hindering his six-period practice of the Way. Ancient patriarchs acting for the Dharma were like this. This differed from those who wear fine silks, eat refined foods, and

consider dwelling in magnificent houses to be glorious. If they were made to hear of Master Liang's style, they would surely be covered in shame and sweat.

**Biography of Vinaya Master Daoxing of Fusheng Temple, Yizhou, Tang**
The Vinaya Master's name was Daoxing, family name Liu, from Qinzhou. In childhood he constantly thought of leaving lay life. Due to his parents' deep affection, he could not fulfill his wish. Whenever he visited monasteries, he would linger with love and admiration, unable to bear leaving all day long. At nineteen, he secretly went to Daguang Temple, determined to seek tonsure. His parents were alarmed and urgently sought him, entering the temple. Seeing his will could not be bent, they then consented. At that time the realm was in great chaos, bandits were everywhere in confusion, and the dead piled up like mountains. His mother was captured by bandits and taken sixty *li* from the city. The Master risked his life to pursue and follow them. The bandits saw him and sighed, saying: "This is a filial son among monks." They then released her. The Master carried his mother home - this could be called utmost filial piety. Later he went to Shu. On the journey he met an old monk and traveled with him. The old monk said to the Master: "I have ten *liang* of gold. You can carry it, and when we reach Shu we'll divide it." The Master shook his head and refused, saying: "This is something that endangers one's life. Moreover, the Tathāgata's golden mouth severely prohibits this - how can it be violated? If you don't believe this, good and evil should be verified." He then abandoned [the old monk] and traveled alone. When the old monk reached Sanquan County, he indeed encountered bandits and was killed. After the Master reached Sichuan, he received full ordination. He was then twenty years old. He constantly stayed in forest monasteries practicing *dhūta* practices. Hearing that Vinaya Master Zhishun was a great lecturer of the age, he directly entered under his instruction. When listening to vinaya he was always able to give review lectures. Shun greatly praised and admired him. The Master soon traveled to the capital, following Vinaya Master Zhishou at Hongfu. Morning and evening he consulted and inquired, fully grasping the vinaya essentials. After a long time he took leave and returned to Sichuan, extensively listening to sūtras and treatises without wasting time. He also visited Master Jiang to study seated meditation, controlling his mind and fixing his will, drilling and looking up without forgetting fatigue. When Master Shun passed away, the Master succeeded to his position. Each year he responded to scholars'

requests to open lecture sessions, but would not permit them unless the requests reached twenty or thirty times. Moreover he sighed saying: "In recent times the Dharma gate has declined and disrespect increases daily. I do not dare disparage people - this is done to honor the Dharma." Listeners were moved to tears. The Master once resided at a monastery serving as *karmadāna*. His nature was magnanimous - when he encountered guests, he would always invite them to stay without tiring. At that time the government was strict and did not permit hosting guests. No other temples would accommodate them. [But the Master was] dependable like Mount Tai - he gladly accommodated them. A monk said: "This is government regulation. Why do you rashly host them?" The Master said: "The government doesn't allow even a needle through, yet privately vehicles and horses pass. Haven't you heard of this?" The monk became angry and displeased, saying: "This young man doesn't heed my words." The Master said: "This is the Three Jewels. If you respect them you see good; if you resent them you feel evil." The monk angrily entered his room and looked for his *kaṣāya* but couldn't find it. When he received food it turned to blood. He then blamed himself and apologized to the Master with repentance. The Master later resided at Fusheng Temple, daily paying homage to a thousand Buddhas, never becoming lazy or neglectful. One day he fell ill and suddenly heard music in his room. The Master said: "What I wish for is the supreme Way. The blessings of gods and humans are not what I desire. If my aspiration is not empty, demonic obstacles will naturally disappear." As soon as he finished speaking, the music faded away. From this point his illness immediately healed. In the third year of Yonghui, Dharma Master Xuanzang sent relics for him to make offerings to. The Master then decorated the ritual site and made a vow saying: "Throughout my life I have transmitted the Dharma and daily paid homage to the thousand Buddhas of the Worthy Kalpa. If this accords with the sage's mind, please emit radiant light." Just as he finished speaking, golden light blazed brilliantly, illuminating the room. Everyone around was amazed and sighed in wonder. He peacefully entered extinction on a certain day of a certain month in the fourth year of Xianqing. He was sixty-seven years old with forty-seven summer retreats. The Master's pure conduct was so austere that it was difficult for others to match. Day and night he sat in lotus position and never lay down to rest. He did not go to markets, did not accept special profits, did not ride donkeys or horses, did not wear non-Dharmic clothing. Apart from begging for food, he did not leave the temple gates.

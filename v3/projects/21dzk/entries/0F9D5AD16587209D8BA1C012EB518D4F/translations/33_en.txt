The "five turbidities" refers to the meaning of muddiness and defilement. First, lifespan turbidity; second, kalpa turbidity; third, affliction turbidity; fourth, view turbidity; fifth, sentient being turbidity.

The sutra says: "Clearly making restrictive laws, not allowing my four groups of disciples, monks and nuns, to leave home and practice the Way, and also not allowing them to create Buddha images." Commentary: This discusses the faults of destroying the Dharma.

The sutra says: "Establishing controlling officials to restrict the community, registering monks in records, establishing high seats for laypeople in monks' places, making soldiers and slaves into monks, receiving the dharma of separate invitations, uniting with learned monks in one mind, making feast assemblies for virtuous monks to seek merit - this is like non-Buddhist dharma and is entirely not my Dharma." Commentary: This establishes four evil faults: first establishing officials, second establishing places, third establishing soldiers, fourth separate invitations. Other sutras say: Even separately inviting five hundred arhats does not compare to [inviting] one ordinary monk from the sangha. Those who make separate invitations follow non-Buddhist dharma, not the dharma of the seven Buddhas.

The sutra says: "At that time, the True Dharma will perish before long." Commentary: This concludes the faults.

The sutra says: "Great King, the destruction and disruption of my Way is your own doing." Commentary: This warns against disrupting the practices of the four groups.

The sutra says: "Relying on威力 to control my four groups of disciples." Commentary: This discusses the characteristics of the faults.

The sutra says: "The people suffer from illness and hardship without exception - this is the cause of destroying the nation." Commentary: This reveals their karmic retribution.

The sutra says: "Speaking of the sins and faults of the five turbidities would not be exhausted even through countless kalpas." Commentary: This concludes the gravity of the faults.

The sutra says: "Great King, in the final Dharma age, there will be monks, four groups of disciples, kings, and great ministers who each perform unlawful acts." Commentary: This warns and prohibits the fault of not following the Dharma.

The sutra says: "Acting unlawfully toward the Buddha-Dharma and sangha, creating great unlawful acts and various sins." Commentary: This separately reveals the characteristics of faults.

The sutra says: "Unlawfully and against the vinaya, binding monks like the treatment of prisoners." Commentary: Unlawfully imprisoning them.

The sutra says: "At that time, the Dharma will perish before long." Commentary: This concludes and establishes the gravity of the faults.

The sutra says: "Great King, after my parinirvana, in future ages, the four groups of disciples, various minor kings, crown princes, and princes, including those who maintain and protect the Three Jewels, will turn and further destroy the Three Jewels." Commentary: This warns about self-destruction. First self-destruction, then arising evil, then attracting retribution.

The sutra says: "Like insects within a lion's body that eat the lion themselves - this is not from non-Buddhists." Commentary: Using analogy to provide further explanation. As in the Lotus-Face Sutra, the Buddha told Ananda: "It is like when a lion dies - whether in empty places, on land, or in water, all existing beings do not dare to eat the lion's flesh. Only the lion itself produces various insects that then eat its flesh. Ananda, my Buddha-Dharma cannot be destroyed by others. It is the evil monks within my Dharma who destroy the Buddha-Dharma that I accumulated through diligent practice over three great kalpas."

The sutra says: "Greatly destroying my Buddha-Dharma and obtaining great sins, with true teaching declining and people having no proper conduct, gradually becoming evil, their lifespans daily decreasing to one hundred years." Commentary: Arising evil has three aspects: first, destroying Dharma and obtaining sin; second, true teaching not being practiced; third, increasing evil and decreasing lifespan.

The sutra says: "When people destroy Buddha's teaching, there are no longer filial children, the six relatives are not harmonious, heavenly spirits do not protect them, epidemic diseases and evil spirits come daily to cause harm, disasters and strange phenomena occur continuously." Commentary: This attracts the disasters of present retribution. Because they never cease. "Six relatives" refers to parents, brothers, and spouses.

The sutra says: "Upon death, they enter hell, hungry ghost, and animal realms." Commentary: This clarifies birth retribution.

The sutra says: "If reborn as humans, they receive the retribution of being soldiers and slaves." Commentary: This clarifies future retribution.

The sutra says: "Like an echo, like a shadow, like when a person writes at night and though the fire dies out, the characters remain." Commentary: Using analogies to reveal the dharma. First analogizing present retribution. Just as having sound and form produces echo and shadow, there must be present karma. The reported results are definitely simultaneous. The later analogy compares birth and future retribution. Like a person writing at night - though the fire dies out, the characters remain. Though present karma perishes, the two retributions still exist. Or possibly, the former generally analogizes the three times. If there are three karmas, there must be corresponding fruits. Just as where there is brightness, there must be dark shadows.

The sutra says: "The karmic retribution of the three realms is also like this." Commentary: This should be understood as matching the dharma.

The sutra says: "Great King, in future ages, all kings, crown princes, princes, and four groups of disciples will wrongfully impose written regulations and precepts on Buddha's disciples, treating them like laypeople's laws, like soldiers' and slaves' laws." Commentary: The fifth warning about the fault of controlling monks.

The sutra says: "If my disciples, monks and nuns, are registered and made to serve officials, they are entirely not my disciples - this is the law of soldiers and slaves." Commentary: This clarifies forced service.

The sutra says: "Establishing controlling officials to govern monks, managing monk registries, with major and minor monk administrators mutually controlling and binding each other like prisoner laws, soldier and slave laws." Commentary: There are faults in administrative control.

The sutra says: "At that time, the Buddha-Dharma will not last long." Commentary: This reveals and demonstrates the faults.

The sutra says: "Great King, in future ages, various minor kings and four groups of disciples will create these sins themselves as causes for destroying the nation, and they themselves will receive the consequences - this is not [the fault of] the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha." Commentary: This warns about one's own faults. One creates and receives the consequences oneself.

The sutra says: "Great King, circulating this sutra in future ages is the Dharma vessel of the seven Buddhas, the path constantly practiced by Buddhas of the ten directions." Commentary: This warns about deep faith.

The sutra says: "Various evil monks, greatly seeking fame and profit, will speak before kings, crown princes, and princes about causes for destroying Buddha-Dharma and causes for destroying nations." Commentary: This reveals and demonstrates evil. Monks speak for themselves to destroy the Dharma, causing kings to act - this is called destroying the nation.

The sutra says: "Those kings, not discriminating, will believe and listen to these words, wrongfully creating legal systems not based on Buddha's precepts." Commentary: This clarifies kings and others. Not knowing they seek fame and profit, not choosing but immediately listening. Using this brings disasters and calamities.

The sutra says: "This becomes the cause for destroying Buddha and destroying the nation. At that time, the True Dharma will perish before long." Commentary: This repeatedly demonstrates the faults. Believing others' flattering words and not relying on Buddha's words - this is the cause of destroying the nation.

The sutra says: "At that time, the sixteen great kings, hearing the future age events spoken by the Buddha's seven warnings, wept and cried bitterly, their voices shaking the three thousand [worlds], and the sun, moon, five planets, and twenty-eight constellations lost their light and did not appear." Commentary: Below the great assembly maintains and upholds.

The sutra says: "At that time, all the kings each wholeheartedly received and maintained the Buddha's words, not restricting the four groups of disciples from leaving home and practicing the Way, acting according to Buddha's teaching." Commentary: Receiving and maintaining Buddha's teaching.

The sutra says: "At that time, the great assembly of eighteen Brahma kings and princes of the six desire [heavens] all sighed and said: 'At that time the world will be empty - this is an age without Buddha.'" Commentary: The various heavenly kings and others lament the evil times. It is an age without Buddha.

The sutra says: "At that time, among the immeasurable great assembly were one hundred billion bodhisattvas including Maitreya and Lion Moon, one hundred billion including Śāriputra and Subhūti, five hundred billion of the eighteen Brahmās and princes of the six desire heavens, beings of the three realms and six paths, and asura kings." Commentary: Below the great assembly practices accordingly. First the people who receive, then the dharma received. Regarding the first, there are three: first listing one hundred billion bodhisattvas, second listing one hundred billion including Śāriputra, third listing five hundred billion heavenly princes and others.

The sutra says: "Hearing what the Buddha explained about the causes for protecting Buddha-fruit and the causes for protecting the nation, [they were] immeasurably joyful, paid respect to the Buddha, and received and maintained the Prajñāpāramitā." Commentary: This reveals the received dharma. Hearing the Buddha's explanation of the two protective causes, they reverently received and maintained the dharma of practice.

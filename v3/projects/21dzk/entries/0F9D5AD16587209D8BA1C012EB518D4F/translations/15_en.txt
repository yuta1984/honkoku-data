The sutra says: "Good son, if a bodhisattva sees dharmas, sentient beings, self, person, and views, then this person walking in the world is not different from the world." The interpretation says: From below distinguishing the gains and losses of contemplation. There are generally five views. Before the ten faiths, ordinary beings and the two vehicles grasp that there are nirvana dharmas—this is dharma-self view. "Sentient beings" etc. are person-self views, therefore not different from the world.

The sutra says: "Regarding all dharmas, neither moving, arriving, ceasing, having characteristics, nor having no-characteristics; all dharmas are also thus." The interpretation says: From below clarifying right contemplation. First clarifying expedient right contemplation, then clarifying right contemplation of entering stages. From the ten faiths upward to the ten dedications, all practice this contemplation. The contemplated empty principle is equally one-flavored, therefore without movement or change. Because there is no movement or change, there is no arriving. "Arriving" means arising. Because there is no movement, there is no arising. Because there is no arising, there is also no cessation. Because there is no arising or cessation, there are also no characteristics. Through having no characteristics, in relation to what would one speak of "no characteristics"? Therefore saying "no no-characteristics." Through this meaning, all dharmas are all thus.

The sutra says: "All Buddhas, Dharma, and Sangha are also thus. This is the initial ground's one thought-moment perfectly equipped with eighty-four thousand pāramitās." The interpretation says: Clarifying right contemplation of entering stages. First clarifying right contemplation, then showing the source. According to the Bhadrakalpa Sutra, the Tathāgata's three hundred fifty perfections begin from the Light-Radiance Perfection up to the Distributing Relics Perfection. Each of these has the six perfections as cause, totaling two thousand one hundred. Further, using these practices to counteract the sufferings of the four great elements, six declines, and ten dharmas, there are twenty-one thousand. Also counteracting four types of people—namely greed, anger, delusion, and equally distributed—each having twenty-one thousand, thus forming eighty-four thousand. The Tripiṭaka interpretation says: According to the ten fetters, they are explained as ten fetters. One fetter uses nine fetters as expedient means, so one fetter has ten. Ten fetters make

one hundred. Establishing this one hundred as foundation, there are again before-and-after expedient means, each again one hundred, making three hundred. Using the original one hundred with the two hundred, each one using nine fetters as expedient means, together with the original two hundred, combining to form two thousand. Adding the original one hundred makes two thousand one hundred. Also according to five categories, each category having two thousand one hundred, making ten thousand five hundred. Already arisen are ten thousand five hundred, not yet arisen are ten thousand five hundred, combined twenty-one thousand. Also using the three poisons equally distributed among four types of people, forming eighty-four thousand. Speaking of "five categories" means: much greed, much anger, discursive thought, ignorance, and self.

The sutra says: "What is able to transport is called mahāyāna." The interpretation says: Praising according to name.

The sutra says: "Immediate cessation becomes vajra and is also called concentration." The interpretation says: Praising according to function. First praising equal enlightenment, then praising wonderful enlightenment. Namely, the final thought-moment of the tenth ground can break the two obstructions, like vajra breaking objects. Being free from distraction, it is also called concentration.

The sutra says: "Also called all practices, as explained in the Light-Praise Prajñāpāramitā." The interpretation says: Praising the wonderful enlightenment stage. Within one practice, possessing all practices, therefore called "all practices." This is the liberation path.

The sutra says: "Great King, this sutra's names, words, and sentences are the names, words, and sentences spoken by hundreds of Buddhas, thousands of Buddhas, hundreds of thousands of myriads of Buddhas." The interpretation says: From below protecting and praising the written-word prajñā. First praising the excellence of the teaching, then developing contemplation based on the teaching. There are four supremacies: first, supremacy of the speaker; second, supremacy of faith-acceptance; third, supremacy of what is spoken; fourth, supremacy of wisdom. This is the first supremacy of the speaker. Because all Buddhas' teachings are the same. Speaking of "names and words": provisionally established upon sounds, included in non-concomitant formation aggregates. Names explain inherent nature, sentences explain distinc-

tions. As the two foundations, they are called sentences.

The sutra says: "Making immeasurable seven treasures in Ganges-sand three-thousand great-thousand worlds, giving to sentient beings in three-thousand great-thousand worlds so they all attain seven worthies and four fruits, is not equal to arousing one thought of faith in this sutra, how much more one who understands one sentence." The interpretation says: The second supremacy of faith-acceptance. Speaking of "three-thousand great-thousand" means: accumulating one Sumeru to a thousand number is called a small thousand-world. Accumulating one thousand Sumerus to a thousand number is called a medium thousand-world. Accumulating medium thousand-worlds to a thousand number is called a great thousand-world. Combining the three thousand worlds equals ten billion in number. The seven worthies of faith-practice and four fruits of stream-entry holy persons etc., because they don't understand emptiness, obtain little merit. This sutra explains emptiness, therefore the merit obtained is very great.

The sutra says: "Sentences are non-sentences, non-non-sentences." The interpretation says: This is supremacy of what is spoken. "Sentences non-sentences" means inherent nature emptiness. The essence of all name-sentences is originally inherently empty. "Non-non-sentences" means neither existence nor non-existence through cultivation, thereby eliminating the two dharmas of existence and non-existence. Written emptiness non-sentences are inherent nature attainment. Non-non-sentences are accordance with cultivated path nature.

The sutra says: "Prajñā is non-sentences, sentences are non-prajñā." The interpretation says: Text and meaning are both empty. "Prajñā non-sentences" means meaning-emptiness. "Sentences non-prajñā" means text-emptiness. Seeking prajñā within text is unobtainable. Seeking text within prajñā is also unobtainable. Apart from text there is no meaning; apart from meaning there is no text. Briefly explaining mutual non-existence.

The sutra says: "Prajñā is also non-bodhisattva." The interpretation says: Both person and dharma are empty. Prajñā is dharma, bodhisattva is person.

【Left page, lower section】
Seeking dharma within person is unobtainable. Seeking person within dharma is also unobtainable.

The sutra says: "Why is this so?" The interpretation says: This is questioning.

The sutra says: "Because the thirty births of the ten grounds are empty, initial birth, abiding birth, and final birth are unobtainable. Because the three births within each ground are empty." The interpretation says: This explains dharma-emptiness.

The sutra says: "Also not sarvajña, not mahāyāna, because of emptiness." The interpretation says: This explains emptiness based on fruition. Speaking of "sarvajña" means "all-knowledge" here. Explaining mutual non-existence can be understood according to the previous.

The sutra says: "Great King, if a bodhisattva sees objects, sees wisdom, sees teaching, sees reception, this is not noble seeing but inverted conceptual seeing—ordinary person dharma." The interpretation says: From below developing contemplation based on teaching. First clarifying inverted conceptual contemplation, then clarifying right contemplation. Speaking of "seeing objects" means seeing real-nature prajñā. Speaking of "seeing wisdom" means seeing contemplative prajñā. "Seeing teaching" means seeing written-word prajñā. "Seeing reception" means having attachment within various objects, therefore not right seeing.

The sutra says: "Seeing the three realms is the name of sentient beings' karmic retribution." The interpretation says: From below clarifying right contemplation. The three realms only have the name of fruits but no real substance.

The sutra says: "Six consciousnesses arising with immeasurable desires, endlessly, are called desire-realm treasury-emptiness. Or karmic fruits arising from form are called form-realm treasury-emptiness. Or karmic fruits arising from mind are called formless-realm treasury-emptiness." The interpretation says: From below clarifying karma-emptiness. Speaking of "arising immeasurable desires" means creating karma and receiving birth—the meaning of endlessness. Those karmas are called "treasury" because they store fruits. Because greed and desire generate karma.

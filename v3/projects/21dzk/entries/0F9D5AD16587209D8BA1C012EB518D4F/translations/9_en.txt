There are three types of virtue. First, the virtue of the five precepts; second, the virtue of the ten good deeds; third, the virtue of taking the three refuges. "Pure faith and conduct being complete" is a general conclusion. "Complete" generally concludes all virtues. Also, it means equally attaining the right faith of the Mahāyāna. "Complete" means that the four faiths are adequately complete in their respective aspects - namely, faith in the Three Jewels, precepts, and so forth. Master Fan says: "Having pure faith determined toward the Three Jewels, far removed from turbidity."

The sūtra says: "There were also all sentient beings of the five paths." The interpretation says: Tenth, distinguishing the assembly of the five paths. This is also called the assembly of mixed types. Question: Do hell beings come or not? If we say they come, the Yogācāra and other teachings say that hell is entirely pure suffering, and some portions of animal and hungry ghost realms are likewise. If they don't come, how does this sūtra have an assembly of the five paths? Answer: There are two explanations. One says they don't come, because the Yogācāra and others speak of places of pure suffering. However, when this sūtra speaks of "assembly of the five paths," it speaks from the perspective of the majority. One says they also come, because this sūtra speaks of "having an assembly of the five paths." In the Dhāraṇī Sūtra there is an assembly of hell beings. Speaking of "entirely suffering" refers to speaking from the majority perspective, according to their own power. The Six Categories and others say that when Buddha's light temporarily illuminates, suffering ceases.

The sūtra says: "There were also immeasurable assemblies from other directions." The interpretation says: Eleventh, assemblies from other directions. Question: Among the assemblies from other directions, are these only bodhisattvas who have attained supernatural powers, or do they also include other assemblies who have not yet attained powers? Answer: According to the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra and the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom, this includes the seven types of assemblies, as well as boys and girls who have not yet attained powers. Question: If so, how are they able to come? Answer: According to the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom, those with supernatural powers can come by their own power. Those with weak spiritual power or no powers [come through] that buddha-land's Buddha's power. This is also following along with the great bodhisattvas' power. This is also the power of Śākyamuni's light illumination. Even one power enables coming, how much more three powers. Although lacking self-power, they come through other

power. Master Fan says: "According to the Vaipulya Sūtra, the sage Vasubandhu also brings hell beings to participate in the Dharma assembly."

The sūtra says: "Furthermore, transforming the pure lands of the ten directions, manifesting hundreds of koṭis of high seats, creating hundreds of koṭis of Mount Sumeru jeweled flowers." The interpretation says: Twelfth, clarifying the transformed assembly. The text has two distinct parts. First, clarifying the transformation of the supporting lands; later, explaining the transformation of the supported assemblies. Regarding the first, there are three parts. First, transforming the land; next, transforming the seats; finally, transforming the flowers. "Mount Sumeru flowers" means "wonderful and lofty flowers."

The sūtra says: "On the flowers before each seat were immeasurable transformation buddhas, immeasurable bodhisattvas, monks, and great assemblies of the eight groups, each seated on jeweled lotus flowers." The interpretation says: This later explains the supported assemblies. There are four types: first, immeasurable buddhas; second, immeasurable bodhisattvas; third, immeasurable monks; fourth, immeasurable assemblies of the eight groups. Regarding "eight groups," Master Ce says: "There are three types of eight groups. First, the eight groups of devas, nāgas, and others, complete as commonly explained. Second, the four heavenly kings each lead two groups. The Dhṛtarāṣṭra heavenly king leads two groups: gandharvas and piśācas. Virūḍhaka heaven leads two groups: kumbhāṇḍas and pūtanas. Virūpākṣa heavenly king leads two groups: nāgas and pūtanas. Vaiśravaṇa heavenly king leads two groups: yakṣas and rākṣasas. Third are the kṣatriya assembly, brāhmaṇa assembly, householder assembly, śramaṇa assembly, four kings assembly, Trāyastriṃśa heaven assembly, māra assembly, and Brahmā assembly."

The sūtra says: "On the flowers were immeasurable lands, and in each land the buddhas and great assemblies were no different from now." The interpretation says: From here below, clarifying the repeated transformations.

The sūtra says: "In each land, each great assembly respectively expounds the Prajñāpāramitā." The interpretation says: Next, clarifying the assemblies expounding the sūtra. Here it refers to transforming and causing various teachings.

The sūtra says: "Other-direction great assemblies, transformation assemblies, assemblies within these three realms - twelve great assemblies all came together in gathering." The interpretation says: Fifth, the recipients of the teaching. The text has two distinct parts. First, separately manifesting and praising virtues; later, general conclusion. Having manifested the assemblies above has already been completed. From here below, second, generally concluding the gathering. The text has three distinct parts. First, clarifying the gathering of twelve great assemblies; next, clarifying the extent of seating arrangements; finally, clarifying seating protocol. This is the first part. "Twelve assemblies" means: first, other-direction assemblies; second, transformation assemblies; and ten assemblies within the three realms.

The sūtra says: "Seated on nine-tiered lotus flowers, the assembly extending in all directions nine hundred fifty li, the great assembly seated harmoniously." The interpretation says: Second, the extent of seating arrangements; third, seating protocol. This should be understood according to the sūtra. Regarding "nine-tiered lotus flowers," Master Zang says: "Nine-layered flower seats." Master Fan says: "Kalpa means level." Commander says: "Speaking of 'other directions' concludes the previous other-direction assemblies. Speaking of 'transformation assemblies' concludes the previous transformation assemblies. Speaking of 'within these three realms' concludes the previous assemblies from this direction. Speaking of 'twelve' generally concludes the previous three assemblies." Kalpa means steps.

The sūtra says: "At that time, the one with ten epithets, three clear knowledges, great cessation truth, vajra wisdom - Buddha Śākyamuni." The interpretation says: From here below, second, clarifying the introductory sequence. The text has five distinct parts. First, the Tathāgata manifests auspicious signs; second, the great assembly generates doubt; third, awakening regarding the Tathāgata; fourth, the Buddha ascends the flower seat; fifth, the great assembly rejoices. This is the first part. There are four

types of virtue. First, the virtue of ten epithets; second, the virtue of three clear knowledges; third, the virtue of cessation; fourth, the virtue of wisdom. This concerns general epithets. Regarding "ten epithets," if we follow the Sūtra of the Original Karma Necklace, the World-Honored One does not enter into the number of ten epithets. It says: "The causal and resultant dharmas of all buddhas' paths do not differ. The so-called ten epithets are: first, Tathāgata; second, Arhat; third, Perfectly Enlightened; fourth, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct; fifth, Well-Gone; sixth, Knower of the World; seventh, Unsurpassed; eighth, Tamer of Men; ninth, Teacher of Gods and Humans; tenth, Buddha." If we follow the Nirvāṇa Sūtra, it says: "Beyond the ten epithets, Bhagavat is separately explained. The ten epithets are the same as those explained in the Necklace Sūtra." If we follow the Yogācāra and Satyasiddhi treatises, World-Honored One becomes the tenth epithet. "Unsurpassed Tamer of Men" combines to form one count as the seventh. "Teacher of Gods and Humans" is eighth, "Buddha" is ninth, "World-Honored One" is tenth. The other six are the same as before. "Three clear knowledges" refers to knowledge of past lives, knowledge of birth and death, and knowledge of the cessation of outflows. "Great cessation truth vajra wisdom" refers to the two gates of wisdom and cessation virtues. Cessation refers to nirvāṇa, with suchness as its essence. Wisdom is bodhi, with the four wisdoms as its nature. It is called "great" in contrast to Hīnayāna teachings. Great cessation truth is great nirvāṇa; vajra wisdom is great bodhi. Like Mount Vajra being noble, lofty, manifest, solid, and difficult to destroy, hence the analogy to vajra. "Śākyamuni" refers to the person accomplished through virtue. Śākya is the clan name, meaning "able sage." Muni is the personal name, meaning "silent sage," because body and speech are silent. As explained in the Long Āgama Sūtra: Long ago there was a king whose four sons committed faults, so he sent them toward the Himalayas under the bodhi trees to sustain themselves. The four sons went there and were able to sustain themselves. The king praised the four sons: "These are true Śākya sons, able to establish themselves independently." Because of this, it became the clan name. From the Buddha's fourth ancestor onward, they began to have Śākya as their surname. Another explanation: Śākya

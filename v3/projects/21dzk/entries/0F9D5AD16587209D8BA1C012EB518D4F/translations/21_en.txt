ings.

The sutra says: "Moreover, sixteen Brahmā [deities] attained the patience of non-arising dharmas and the patience of the bliss of non-arising dharmas." The interpretation says: This is the ten practices. The patience of the bliss of non-arising dharmas refers to the ten dedications of merit.

The sutra says: "Moreover, bodhisattvas who had already studied previously realized the first stage, second stage, third stage up to the tenth stage." The interpretation says: Bodhisattvas of the learning stages personally realize from the first stage up to the tenth stage.

The sutra says: "Moreover, the eight classes of asura kings attained ten samādhi gates, attained two samādhi gates, and attained transformation from ghost bodies to correct reception in heaven." The interpretation says: The non-gods gained benefit. The ten samādhis refer to the ten totality bases. The two samādhis refer to the samādhi of the two truths. Or when first entering the holy path, one must possess samādhi—namely, the signless samādhi. Because it eliminates the obstructions of the ten stages, it is called the ten samādhis. Speaking of "two samādhis" refers to emptiness and wishlessness. Attaining transformation from ghost bodies means attaining the undefiled holy path.

The sutra says: "Those present in this assembly all attained self-nature faith up to limitless emptiness faith." The interpretation says: This clarifies ordinary people attaining faith. Buddha-nature is called self-nature faith. Speaking of "limitless emptiness faith" refers to dharma-emptiness faith.

The sutra says: "I now briefly explain, but the merits of devas and others cannot be fully exhausted." The interpretation says: This is the general conclusion. One should understand this.

Flower-Scattering Chapter Six

In interpreting this chapter, there are briefly two meanings. First, interpreting the chapter name. Second, correctly interpreting the sutra text. Interpreting the chapter name: The various kings heard the dharma, respectfully bore the Buddha's grace, and scattered flowers in offering. It is called the Flower-Scattering Chapter.

The sutra says: "At that time, the sixteen great kings, hearing the Buddha's explanation of ten million billion verses of Prajñāpāramitā,

felt limitless joy." The interpretation says: Second, correctly interpreting according to the text. The four previous chapters discussed inner and outer protection. This is the third: bearing gratitude and making offerings. Within this there are three parts. First, the various kings scatter flowers in offering. Next, the Buddha manifests miraculous transformations to enable the assembly to gain benefit. Finally, he praises prajñā and encourages the assembly to accept and maintain it. Question: In this sutra, the prajñā that is explained differs in three places. In the Two Truths Chapter: eight trillion verses. In the Protecting the Country Chapter: eight thousand billion verses. In the Flower-Scattering Chapter: ten million verses. What is the difference? The explanation says: In the Two Truths Chapter, it combines the explanations of Buddhas of three time periods, so there are a total of eight trillion verses, but they are not [specifically] for the Benevolent King. In the Protecting the Country Chapter, it separately quotes the Benevolent King Prajñā explained by the past seven Buddhas. In this chapter, it presents the Benevolent King Prajñā explained by the present Buddha. This is due to the explanations of these three places being different. Question: The Protecting the Country Chapter says that in one day eight thousand billion verses were completely explained. How could eight thousand billion verses like this be explained in one day? The explanation says: Because of the Buddha's spiritual power providing invisible assistance. Master Fan says: In Śākyamuni's explanations, there were one hundred and ten trillion chapters. What Universal Brightness heard—the explanations of the past seven Buddhas—was eight thousand billion chapters. Compiled according to [different] capacities, the circulation was not extensive.

The sutra says: "They immediately scattered one hundred million trillion practice-flowers, which transformed in empty space into one seat. The Buddhas of the ten directions shared seats as one seat to explain Prajñāpāramitā. Countless great assemblies shared seats as one seat, holding golden net flowers and scattering them above Śākyamuni Buddha, forming ten thousand wheel flower-canopies above the great assembly." The interpretation says: Second, scattering flowers in offering. First practice-flowers, next prajñā flowers, finally wonderful awakening flowers. All take their names from what they represent. The first practice-flowers represent the three worthy [stages]—these are conditioned practices. The next prajñā flowers represent the ten holy [stages]—these are unconditioned wisdom.

The final wonderful awakening flowers are to reveal the perfect awakening dharma of the Buddha stage. The seats represent the three worthy [stages] because they are the lowest. The platforms represent the ten holy [stages] because they transcend the conditioned. The cities represent nirvana as supremely victorious. The transformation Buddhas explaining dharma represent that the dharma is supreme because of the shared explanation. The transformation assemblies scattering flowers represent that people are supreme—they are able to make offerings. The following interpretations follow this pattern.

The sutra says: "They again scattered eighty-four thousand prajñāpāramitā flowers, which transformed in empty space into white cloud platforms. In the platforms, the Buddha King of Light together with countless great assemblies explained Prajñāpāramitā. The great assemblies in the platforms held thunder-roar flowers and scattered them on Śākyamuni Buddha and all the great assemblies." The interpretation says: Second, scattering prajñā flowers.

The sutra says: "They again scattered wonderful awakening flowers, which transformed in empty space into vajra cities. In the cities, the Buddha Lion-Roar King together with Buddhas of the ten directions and great bodhisattva assemblies discussed the ultimate truth." The interpretation says: Third, scattering wonderful awakening flowers. The vajra wisdom city is a metaphor for nirvana. The dual brightness of wisdom and cutting off [afflictions] is called the vajra city.

The sutra says: "At that time the bodhisattvas in the city held luminous flowers and scattered them above Śākyamuni Buddha, forming one flower platform. In the platform, Buddhas of the ten directions explained the non-dual dharma. The various devas and humans also scattered heavenly flowers above Śākyamuni Buddha. In empty space they formed purple cloud canopies covering the great trichiliocosm. The devas and humans in the canopies scattered Ganges flowers that fell like clouds." The interpretation says: Fourth, the transformation assembly scattering flowers. Due to the wonderful awakening flowers' merit and power being supreme, therefore in this section there is triple flower-scattering and double transformations.

The sutra says: "At that time, after the various kings had made flower offerings, they wished: 'May past, present, and future Buddhas always explain Prajñāpāramitā. May all those who accept and maintain it—monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—have their wishes fulfilled and

always practice Prajñāpāramitā.'" The interpretation says: Second, the various kings make vows. First the various kings make vows, then the Buddha immediately confirms them. This is the first part.

The sutra says: "The Buddha told the great king: 'The Prajñāpāramitā that has been explained should be explained and should be received. It is the mother of all Buddhas, the mother of all bodhisattvas, the birthplace of spiritual powers.'" The interpretation says: Second, immediately confirming. Speaking of "mother of all Buddhas" reveals essential-nature prajñā. Speaking of "mother of all bodhisattvas" reveals contemplative prajñā. Speaking of "spiritual powers" refers to textual prajñā. Another interpretation: Because prajñā can give birth to all Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and spiritual powers, it is called mother.

The sutra says: "At that time the Buddha manifested five inconceivable miraculous transformations for the king." The interpretation says: Second, the Buddha manifests miraculous transformations to enable the assembly to gain benefit. This refers to samādhi transformations, namely conversions. Through the power of samādhi, conversion is unrestricted, therefore it is called miraculous transformation. "Inconceivable" means the mind cannot think it, speech cannot discuss it—this is called inconceivable. The Lotus Sutra says: "Not what the mouth can proclaim, not what the mind can fathom." The Mahāprajñāpāramitā says: "The path of mind and speech is cut off"—this is called inconceivable.

The sutra says: "One flower entered countless flowers, countless flowers entered one flower; one Buddha-land entered countless Buddha-lands, countless Buddha-lands entered one Buddha-land; countless Buddha Buddha-lands entered one hair-tip land, one hair-tip land entered countless hair-tip lands; countless Mount Sumerus and countless great seas entered a mustard seed; one Buddha-body entered countless sentient beings' bodies, countless sentient beings' bodies entered one Buddha-body, entered six-path bodies, entered bodies of earth, water, fire, and wind." The interpretation says: Second, sequentially narrating separately. Within this there are two parts. First separate narration, then repeated praise. This concerns five transformations. First, regarding flowers—the mutual interpenetration of one and many. Second, regarding Buddha-lands—the one and many

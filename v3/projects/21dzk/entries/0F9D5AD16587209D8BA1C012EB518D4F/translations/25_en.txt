The sutra says: "Like water and waves being neither one nor different." The interpretation says: Raising an analogy to show that they are neither one nor different.

In this ground, because flawless contemplation is accomplished, one encompasses and stores all gates of merit. Logically, all stages should have this gate, but because it is not the first, it is not separately established.

The sutra says: "Having no birth from three-realm karmic habits, completing the old and not creating new [karma]." The interpretation says: Distinctions in receiving birth.

One explanation: Master Fan says that karma-generating ignorance is eliminated by seeing, therefore completing the old without creating new karma. From the eighth ground and above, the manifested body is only transformation. Before the seventh ground, one intentionally arouses delusions, nourishes three-realm karma, and receives bodies with limited lifespans. This transformation body receives the retribution of ten kings. Adding the current explanation: first-ground bodhisattvas, if those with superior great wisdom are born in the Extensive Fruit Heaven and receive transformation birth. If those with superior great compassion

sutra text saying "three-existence anger" speaks according to the adaptive teaching approach. Also, the words are general but the meaning is specific.

The sutra says: "Always practicing the three-brightness contemplation in signless patience." The interpretation says: The second [section] distinguishing contemplation differences.

The sutra says: "Furthermore, Jyotiṣmatī Sacred Awakening-Realization Bodhisattva." The interpretation says: The seventh dharma teacher. The textual divisions can be understood. "Jyotiṣmatī" means "wisdom mother." In this stage, the two emptinesses of person and dharma can generate the holy path, therefore called "wisdom mother." Master Zang says: advancing to sever conceptualization, therefore called "awakening-realization." Realm can generate wisdom; taking realm as wisdom mother. From analogy it is called "flame ground."

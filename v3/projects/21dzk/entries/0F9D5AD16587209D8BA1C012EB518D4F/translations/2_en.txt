The master says: "If one wishes to propagate and proclaim the true dharma, one must understand the partial and complete aspects of the teaching, and only then can one truly comprehend the teaching one upholds. If we were to fully clarify the characteristics of teachings, the various sutras are not the same, as detailed in the Lotus Sutra's Profound Meaning. Now I shall briefly clarify this. The various masters of Jiangdong divide teachings into three types. First is sudden teaching, meaning when the Buddha first appeared and suddenly clarified profound principles. Second is gradual teaching, meaning progressing from shallow to deep. Third is directionless and indeterminate teaching, meaning the shallow and deep are indeterminate. However, within gradual teaching, there are briefly two explanations. One says gradual has four periods, and this sutra is taught in the second period. This is Mahayana teaching. The second says gradual has five periods, and this sutra is taught in the second period. This is the common teaching of the three vehicles. Both masters explain that Prajñā is taught in the second period. Therefore, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra states 'the second turning of the dharma wheel.' Now I think this is not so. If one takes the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra and, comparing it to the initial teaching, calls it 'the second period,' then the Parable Chapter of the Lotus Sutra, which says 'At Benares, now again turning the most sublime,' also clarifies this in comparison to the initial teaching and should also be second period teaching. Also, the Nirvana Sutra says 'Formerly at Benares, now at Kushinagara, expounding the great nirvana'—this also compares to the initial teaching and should be the second period. Later students should research and investigate for themselves and not blindly rely on old explanations. Now, following Bodhiruci, one should make the division into incomplete and complete teachings. If it is Hinayana teaching, it is called 'incomplete letters' and named 'Śrāvaka Collection.' Mahayana is called 'complete letters' and named 'Bodhisattva Collection.' Now, examining various sutras and treatises, these words are appropriate. What is called Hinayana incomplete teaching: if speaking of its principle, it only has emptiness of persons; speaking of sacred causes and effects, it only explains the Four Noble Truths with characteristics. This means the teaching does not exhaust the doctrine and the words do not reach the ultimate meaning. It gathers those of small capacity and develops small practices. Having deficiencies, it is called incomplete. Therefore it is called Hinayana and named Śrāvaka Collection. Mahayana complete letter teaching: if clarifying the sacred principle,

it is supremely equal, with unobstructed correct contemplation, taking non-duality as its doctrine. Speaking of sacred causes and effects, it explains the Four Noble Truths without characteristics. This means the teaching accords with the Mahayana doctrine and the words reach the ultimate perfect meaning. It teaches according to great capacity, develops great practices, and is complete without deficiency. This is called complete. Therefore it is called Mahayana and named Bodhisattva Collection. This sutra, among the two collections, belongs to the Mahayana complete letter Bodhisattva Collection. Therefore, the sutra says 'practicing solely the Mahayana' and extensively explains 'only the one Buddha dwells in the pure land.' Hence it is called Mahayana complete teaching Bodhisattva Collection." Question: "Among the five divisions and eight divisions, which does it belong to?" Answer: "The five divisions are as explained in this sutra. The eight divisions are: Mahāprajñāpāramitā, Aṣṭasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā, Guangzan, Fangguang, Daoxing, King's Questions, Prajñā, and Vajra. This King of Benevolence's Questions on Prajñā belongs to the King's Questions. Humans are also heavenly kings. Therefore we know it belongs to the King's Questions on Prajñā."

Fourth, regarding the translation period, interpreting correctly according to the text. There are also two aspects: first, the translation period; second, correct interpretation according to the text. Regarding the translation period: this sutra as one work, according to the text below, naturally has two versions. First is the extensive version. Therefore, the Flower Scattering Chapter below states: "At that time, the sixteen great kings, having heard the Buddha's explanation of the ten million billion verse Prajñāpāramitā Sutra, scattered flowers in offering." Therefore we know this sutra also has an extensive version. Second is the abbreviated version. Although the Sanskrit text is one, following different translators, three versions were produced. First, in the Jin period, first year of Taishi, the Tripitaka Master Dharmarakṣa from the Yuezhi kingdom, called Fahu in Jin, translated one fascicle called "King of Benevolence Prajñā." Second, in the Qin period, third year of Hongshi, Tripitaka Master Kumārajīva, called Tongshou in Qin, at Ding'an Ximing Pavilion Xiaoyao Garden, translated one

version called "King of Benevolence Protecting the Nation Prajñāpāramitā Sutra." Third, in the Liang period, third year of Yongsheng, the Tripitaka Master Paramārtha from Udyāna kingdom in western India, called Zhendi in Liang, at Yuzhang Baoyuan Temple, translated one fascicle called "King of Benevolence Prajñā Sutra." The commentary has six fascicles. Although there are three versions, the Jin version was the initial attempt and probably not comprehensive, and Paramārtha's version is hidden and not circulated. Therefore, now we temporarily rely on the Qin period version.

Regarding the sutra's "Thus have I heard," the explanation states: From here, the second section judges the text and provides correct interpretation. Within this one work, there are eight chapters, naturally having two divisions. First, according to the original record, it is broadly divided into four: first is the introductory section, namely the initial prologue chapter; second is the main exposition section, namely the following five chapters; third is the kings obtaining protection of the nation section, namely the upholding chapter; fourth is the circulation section, namely the entrusting chapter. Now judging this sutra, according to the Buddha-bhūmi-śāstra, it is broadly divided into three: the first chapter is called the section on causes and conditions for the teaching's arising; the next five chapters are called the section on what the sacred teaching explains; the latter two chapters are called the section on practicing according to the teaching. Revealing "having heard" etc. is precisely the causes and conditions for the teaching's arising. Therefore it is called the section on causes and conditions for the teaching's arising. It correctly reveals the differences in the categories of dharma gates explained by the sacred teaching. Therefore it is called the section on what the sacred teaching explains. It reveals that the assembly at that time heard the Buddha's sacred teaching and practiced accordingly. Therefore it is called the section on practicing according to the teaching. This corresponds to the traditional division of prologue, main text, and circulation. Master Zang says: "The sutras expounded by all Buddhas originally have no chapter divisions, as in self-commentary. Dharma Master Dao'an divided sutras into three sections: first, introductory explanation; second, main explanation; third, circulation explanation. Introductory explanation means there is meaning through sequence—the sequence for explaining the sutra. 'Main' means unbiased meaning—the fundamental teaching of one doctrine. 'Circulation' means 'flow' has the meaning of proclamation, 'circulation' has the meaning of non-obstruction, wanting to make the dharma

sound spread far without obstruction. The reason for having three explanations is to clarify that when excellent persons bring forth teachings, there must be causes and conditions, so first the introductory explanation is clarified. When gradual opening is already manifest, the main sutra should be distinguished. Therefore, next comes the main explanation. The great compassion of sages is limitless, and sentient beings' receiving of transformation is endless. It is not merely to benefit the present time nearby, but to want to transmit it far to future generations. Therefore, there is the third circulation. However, these three are not three because they are three, so three is actually one. The prologue chapter is precisely the main text, and even the circulation is precisely the prologue. Now this sutra divides eight chapters into three sections: the first prologue chapter serves as the introductory section; the second section from 'Contemplating Emptiness' through six chapters serves as the main exposition section; the third section of one chapter, 'Entrusting,' is called the circulation section. If following the text, from 'The Buddha addressed Moonlight' at the end of the Upholding Chapter onward is precisely the entrustment. However, the previous chapter clarifies entrustment and distinguishes the non-arising of seven disasters; the latter chapter clarifies entrustment and distinguishes the sutra's scope. Therefore it is called the Entrusting Chapter and named circulation." Master Ce says: "However, within the introductory section, the text is separately divided into two: first clarifying the faith-establishing prologue, then from 'At that time, the Ten Epithets' onward, distinguishing the inspirational prologue. However, these two prologues have three differences: First is the difference in names—one is called faith-establishing, also called general prologue; the second is called inspirational, also called specific prologue. Explaining 'I heard' etc. makes beings generate faith, so it is called faith-establishing. All sutras are the same, so it is called general prologue. Inspiring the main doctrine is called inspirational. Each section is different, so it is called specific prologue. Second is the difference in time—one is called pre-sutra prologue because it first inspires before the sutra is explained; it is also called post-sutra prologue because it is only requested after the sutra is explained. Third is the difference in persons—one is called Tathāgata prologue because in various sutras the Buddha inspires it; it is also called Ānanda prologue because it is only explained after Ānanda requests. Within faith-establishing, there are briefly four aspects: first, explaining the causation of events; second, explaining the intention of events; third, distinguishing the multiplicity of events

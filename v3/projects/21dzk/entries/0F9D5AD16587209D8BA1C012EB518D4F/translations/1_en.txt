The four dharmas of names, sentences, etc., constitute the essence. Therefore, the text below states, "The names, meanings, and sentences of this sutra... even the explanations of a thousand Buddhas," etc. Second, returning to the gate of suchness (tathatā), suchness is taken as the essence. Therefore, the sutra below states, "The dharma is fundamentally suchness, repeated verses are suchness... even discussions are suchness." If we distinguish broadly, it is as explained in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra. Master Youzang says, "The five stages of patience and ten stages constitute the sutra's essence, because one becomes a sage through the five stages of patience." Regarding the main doctrine being explained, Master Ce says, "I shall briefly make three interpretations. First, this sutra takes the three types of prajñā as its fundamental teaching. That is, contemplating the principle of emptiness is called true appearance (reality); the wisdom that explains is called contemplative illumination; the sacred teachings that explain are called written words. Therefore, the chapter on contemplating emptiness explains the three prajñās." First, "This sutra takes clarifying the two truths as its main teaching. Why? Because the chapter on contemplating emptiness clarifies practices for self-benefit, and the chapter on transformation clarifies practices for benefiting others. The contemplative approaches of bodhisattvas do not go beyond these two practices. Such two practices do not go beyond the two truths. Because of the ultimate truth, there is no protector and protected; because of conventional truth, there are both protector and protected, and practices of self and others are accomplished. The two truths are: first, ultimate truth, which is the principle of emptiness; second, conventional truth, which is the gate of existence. In the chapter on two truths, this should be broadly distinguished." First, "Now this sutra takes the absence of characteristics as its main teaching. Therefore, the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra makes such an explanation: Initially, for those aspiring to the śrāvaka vehicle, the wheel of four truths was taught; next, for those aspiring to the bodhisattva vehicle, the wheel of no-characteristics was taught; finally, for those aspiring to all vehicles, the definitive teaching was explained." Question: Regarding this absence of characteristics, among the three natures, which nature is rejected? Among the three kinds of absence of nature, which absence of nature does it depend on? The explanation states: The various masters of the West divide into two interpretations. First, Bhāvaviveka completely rejects the three natures to establish emptiness. That is, he explains the principle of emptiness as the absence of characteristics. This is detailed in the Hastav­āla-prakaraṇa. Second, Dharmapāla only rejects the imputed nature.

【Right page, lower section】
This is taken as the absence of characteristics, as in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra and others. Among the three kinds of absence of nature, both Bhāvaviveka and Dharmapāla depend on the three types of absence of inherent nature as the absence of characteristics. Through this, Paramārtha and the Tripitaka Master Cien each depend on one school. First, Tripitaka Master Paramārtha, following that sequence, completely rejects the three natures and establishes three kinds of absence of nature: first, rejecting the discriminated nature to establish the discriminated nature's absence of characteristics; second, rejecting the dependent nature to establish the dependent nature's absence of arising; third, rejecting the perfected nature to establish the perfected nature's absence of nature. Within one suchness, because the three natures are rejected, three kinds of absence of nature are established. This is detailed in the Trisvabhāvanirdeśa. Therefore, Paramārtha largely agrees with Bhāvaviveka. However, the difference is that Bodhisattva Bhāvaviveka establishes but lacks substance, while Master Paramārtha's intention preserves the three kinds of absence of nature as non-established truth. Second, Tripitaka Master Cien only rejects the imputed nature without rejecting the two natures, because the two meanings of "existing in consciousness but not in principle" and "existing in principle but not in consciousness" are different. Also, the three kinds of absence of nature, following that sequence, explain the three natures as three kinds of absence of nature. Therefore, the Triṃśikā states, "Depending on these three natures, those three kinds of absence of nature are established." This is detailed in the Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi, Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, etc. Therefore, Bodhisattvas Bhāvaviveka and Dharmapāla each depend on their own schools to interpret this sutra.

Question: How do we know that this sutra comprehensively explains the three types of absence of nature? The Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra states: "As the sutra says, 'All dharmas are without inherent nature, without arising, without cessation, originally tranquil, nirvāṇa by nature'—based on what hidden intention? The World-Honored One himself explained: 'All dharmas are without inherent nature' is explained with hidden intention, temporarily depending on the three types of absence of inherent nature. Saying 'All dharmas are without inherent nature, without arising, without cessation, etc.' is explained only depending on the absence of characteristics of inherent nature. Or why is it also explained depending on characteristics and the supreme meaning's absence of inherent nature?" Broad distinctions are as in the tenth volume of the *Śataśāstra. There are interpretations by three masters: First, the Yogācāra students establish the existence of the dependent nature; second, Bodhisattva Bhāvaviveka

explains the emptiness of the dependent nature; third, Bodhisattva Dharmapāla refutes both attachments. Therefore, that treatise states: "First, the Yogācāra students explore the doctrine through reasoning: the discriminated and imputed has no dharma-essence; what arises from causes and conditions has dharma-essence. Through such delusion and karma, one cycles through the three realms of existence, or cultivates applied practices to realize the three enlightenments," and so forth extensively. Second, Bhāvaviveka interprets this sutra saying: "Names are the universally imputed; meanings are the dependent nature. Names, regarding their meanings, are non-existent and therefore empty; meanings, following the world, are not non-existent and therefore existent. One cannot cite this to prove the existence of the dependent nature." Next, the Yogācāra students refute his interpretation of the sutra text in two sections: first, generally indicating the unreasonableness; later, separately showing four faults. The initial general refutation states: "This interpretation is not so, because the meaning contradicts." The later revelation of four faults: First, "If names are non-existent regarding meaning and therefore empty, meaning is also non-existent regarding names. What existence is there?" Second, "Moreover, the verbal expressions established regarding those meanings, being causally arisen like meanings, should exist." Third, "How could there be the nature of what explains and what is explained that is falsely imputed?" Fourth, "Names, following conventional usage, have the ability to explain and express. You cannot permit them to be dependent arising nature. Meanings also, following convention, are conventionally explained as having ability. Why not permit them to be universally imputed?" The concluding refutation states: "Conventional establishment of what explains and what is explained: if non-existent, both should be non-existent; if existent, both should be existent. How does the sutra explain one as existent and one as non-existent? Therefore, your words do not accord with the sutra's meaning." Next, Bhāvaviveka, to prove his own doctrine, again cites the sutra saying: "Through these former names, those dharmas are explained; they all have no inherent nature, because the nature of dharmas is thus." Next, the Yogācāra students refute this explanation saying: "The sutra's intention does not explain that names are non-existent regarding meanings, but only explains that the nature of what is explained by dharmas is not existent. In distinguishing the nature of all dharmas, none can be explained. What is explained by verbal expressions are all general characteristics. The

【Left page, lower section】
individual characteristics of all dharmas transcend verbal expressions. Individual characteristics are not non-existent; general characteristics are not existent." Master Zang says: "If one wishes to expound and lecture on a sutra, one must first understand its main purport. This sutra takes the correct contemplation of non-arising as its fundamental teaching, departing from the two views of existence and non-existence, provisionally called the Middle Way. Therefore, the text below states, 'Prajñā is without knowledge, without seeing... neither arising nor ceasing,' etc. 'Neither arising nor ceasing' is an alternative name for the Middle Way, another designation for inconceivable tranquil extinction. It is also called Buddha-nature. It is the mother of Buddhas in the ten directions; the one great matter is precisely that matter." Tripitaka Master Paramārtha says: "This sutra takes as its fundamental teaching that master craftsman in the causal stage guiding myriad practices." The Great Commander says: "Cultivating the mundane and supramundane paths, through these two paths, one can protect the nation and protect the Buddha-fruit—this is taken as the fundamental teaching."

Third, revealing what the teaching depends on and the sentient beings it is intended for. There are also two aspects: first, revealing what the teaching depends on; second, the sentient beings it is intended for. Regarding what it depends on: although sacred teachings are numerous, essentially they are only the three piṭakas, two collections, and twelve divisions of scriptures. The three piṭakas are: first, sūtranta, translated as "discourses"; second, vinaya, translated as "discipline"; third, abhidharma, translated as "higher dharma." The two collections are: first, the śrāvaka collection; second, the bodhisattva collection. The twelve divisions are: discourses, verses, prophecies, verses for chanting, inspired utterances, causes and conditions, analogies, past events, birth stories, extensive teachings, rare phenomena, and discussions. This sutra, as one work, belongs to the sūtranta collection among the three piṭakas, is included in the bodhisattva collection among the two collections, and is subsumed under discourses among the twelve divisions. Details are as in separate chapters. Regarding what it is intended for: as explained in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, among the three dharma wheels, this sutra belongs to the second dharma wheel. Therefore, we know this sutra is explained for bodhisattvas. If according to the five natures, this sutra is explained for those of bodhisattva nature and those of indeterminate nature. The meaning of the five natures is detailed in separate chapters. Zang

Regarding unobstructed understanding, it has concentration, wisdom, and associated mental factors as its essence. "Four means of gathering" explains the ninth merit. These are: giving, kind words, beneficial conduct, and cooperative action. Their characteristics should be understood. "Vajra cessation samādhi" explains the tenth merit. This refers to the moment after the tenth bhūmi when one can eliminate the two obstructions, hence called "cessation samādhi." There are two meanings: first is the power to cut through—nothing cannot be broken, like a vajra; second is that the afflictions to be eliminated are solid and difficult to cut, like a vajra.

The sūtra says "all merits are accomplished." The interpretation says: Fourth, generally concluding the merits.

The sūtra says "There were also myriad koṭis of five-precept worthy ones." The interpretation says: Below is the fourth assembly of upāsakas. The text has four distinct parts. Following the previous pattern, this can be understood. This raises the dharma and identifies the persons. Taming the mind and being able to accord with the path, therefore called "worthy." Practitioners of conventional designations are called "persons."

The sūtra says "all practice the ten bhūmis of arhats." The interpretation says: Second, clarifying practice and stages. Regarding "ten bhūmis," the various explanations differ. One says the ten abodes constitute the ten bhūmis. Another follows the explanation of ten bhūmis common to the three vehicles, namely: the bhūmi of dry wisdom, nature bhūmi, bhūmi of the eighth person, seeing bhūmi, thin bhūmi, bhūmi free from desire, completed bhūmi, pratyekabuddha bhūmi, bodhisattva bhūmi, Buddha bhūmi, etc. Another refers to the exclusive ten bhūmis: joyful bhūmi, stainless bhūmi, luminous bhūmi, blazing wisdom bhūmi, extremely difficult to conquer bhūmi, manifest bhūmi, far-going bhūmi, immovable bhūmi, good wisdom bhūmi, dharma cloud bhūmi. Here, it explains the common ten bhūmis. Or it could explain both common and exclusive bhūmis without contradiction in principle. All are bhūmis practiced by arhats. According to the *Sākṣāt-kṛta-sūtra*, there are four types of ten bhūmis. First are the ten bhūmis of śrāvakas: the bhūmi of abiding in the three refuges and conduct, the bhūmi of faith-followers, the bhūmi of dharma-followers, the bhūmi of good ordinary

persons, the bhūmi of learning precepts, the bhūmi of the eighth person, the bhūmi of stream-enterers, the bhūmi of once-returners, the bhūmi of non-returners, the bhūmi of arhats. Second are the ten bhūmis of pratyekabuddhas: the bhūmi of accumulating various virtues, the bhūmi of self-awakening to deep dependent origination, the noble truths bhūmi, the bhūmi of supreme deep beneficial arising, the bhūmi of entering the noble eightfold path, the bhūmi of knowing the dharma realm, space realm, and sentient being realm, the bhūmi of realizing cessation, the bhūmi of the nature of the six paths, the bhūmi of entering subtlety, the bhūmi of thin habitual tendencies. Third are the ten bodhisattva bhūmis, as explained below. Fourth are the ten Tathāgata bhūmis, as explained below. The words in this sūtra generally include three types, excluding the ten Buddha bhūmis. These worthy ones, when explained according to their original nature, are śrāvakas; when they turn their minds toward the great [vehicle], they are bodhisattvas; when they cultivate to the ultimate, they necessarily achieve perfection. Master Fan says: "Worthy ones extend through the three vehicles," and so forth extensively. Even the ten Tathāgata bhūmis are all cultivated in parts. Like the abode of initial aspiration, which completely cultivates the ten powers. The previous statement about "practice" is not limited to arhats but extends through the lower ten bhūmis. Master Tong says: "Because they partially possess the meaning of non-arising and non-attachment, they need to cultivate [the path] toward arhatship, hence called 'practicing arhatship.'"

The sūtra says "dedicating toward the complete five divisions of the dharma body." The interpretation says: Third, separately praising merits. Abandoning small vehicle practices and dedicating toward the great vehicle. Master Tong says: "Dedicating toward the ten bhūmis." Master Zang says: "There are two types of dedication: first is dedicating the merits of one's actions below to all sentient beings; second is dedicating the merits of one's actions above toward prajñāpāramitā." "Five divisions" refers to: first, precepts; second, concentration; third, wisdom; fourth, liberation; fifth, knowledge and vision of liberation. The extensive explanation is as usual. Question: What is the difference between the wisdom of no-more-learning and knowledge and vision of liberation? Answer: The Hīnayāna says "the knowledge of suffering and origination in no-more-learning is called the aggregate of wisdom. The knowledge of cessation and path in no-more-learning is the aggregate of knowledge and vision of liberation, etc." The Mahāyāna says: the first three are causes, the latter two are effects. The first three have

the stage of still-learning, the latter two are the stage of no-more-learning. Undefiled concentration and wisdom, and the wisdom of no-more-learning that takes liberation as its object, are called "knowledge and vision of liberation." In the stage of still-learning, there are also five types.

The sūtra says "immeasurable merits are all accomplished." The interpretation says: Fourth, general conclusion.

The sūtra says "There were also ten thousand five-precept faithful women." The interpretation says: Fifth, the assembly of upāsikās. The text has four distinct parts. Following the previous pattern, this should be understood. These are called "women who serve closely." The extensive explanation is as usual.

The sūtra says "all [practice] the ten bhūmis of arhats." The interpretation says: Praising their virtues should be understood.

The sūtra says "all accomplish initial birth merits, abiding birth merits, and final birth merits." The interpretation says: Within the ten stages of faith, each has divisions of entering, abiding, and exiting. Third, separately praising the merits of initial, abiding, and final birth. Master Tong says: "Initial birth refers to the beginning mind of the ten bhūmis. Abiding birth refers to properly abiding in the ten bhūmis. Final birth refers to the fulfilled mind of the ten bhūmis. Within the ten bhūmis, each has three grades, totaling thirty birth merits."

The sūtra says "thirty birth merits are all accomplished." The interpretation says: Fourth, generally concluding. The ten bhūmis each have initial, abiding, and final virtues. Some say: In the above two assemblies, "ten bhūmis" refers to the ten stages of understanding.

The sūtra says "There were also ten koṭis of seven-sage householders." The interpretation says: Sixth, the assembly of householders. Within this there are four parts. Following the above, this should be understood. Having the seven noble treasures, not wearing dharma robes, taking pleasure in staying at home, hence called "householders." Master Zang says: "Seven sages," according to the Hīnayāna, refers to: first, five stopping-mind contemplations; second, separate-characteristic mindfulness; third, general-characteristic mindfulness; fourth, heat; fifth, peak; sixth, patience; seventh, highest worldly dharmas. According to the Mahāyāna: first, initial aspiring persons; second, persons practicing with characteristics; third, persons practicing without characteristics;

【Left page, lower section】
fourth, skillful means practitioners; fifth, cultivated nature; sixth, inherent nature; seventh, path nature. These seven sages exist only before [entering] the bhūmis." Master Jing says: "Because they possess the seven noble treasures, they are called 'seven sages.' Accumulating wealth and fulfilling virtue, they are called 'householders.'"

The sūtra says "virtuous conduct is complete." The interpretation says: Second, generally indicating the completion of the virtues explained below.

The sūtra says "twenty-two categories, ten totality-entrances, eight removal-entrances, eight liberations, three wisdoms, sixteen truths, four truths, contemplation of four-three-two-one categories achieving ninety patiences." The interpretation says: Third, separately praising merits. There are nine gates in total: first, the gate of path factors; second, ten totality bases; third, eight mastery bases; fourth, eight liberations; fifth, three wisdoms; sixth, sixteen truths; seventh, four truths contemplation; eighth, four-conduct contemplation; ninth, ninety patiences. "Twenty-two categories" refers to the seven preparatory stages which, among the path factors, only attain the twenty-two categories of four foundations of mindfulness, four right efforts, four bases of supernatural power, five faculties, and five powers, but are not yet able to attain the seven factors of awakening and the noble eightfold path. Question: Since they have not yet attained sainthood, how can it be said they attain the eight liberations? Answer: Because they attain seven out of eight, it speaks of eight in general. In reality, they have not yet attained the liberation of cessation. "Ten totality-entrances" refers to the second virtue of totality bases: blue, yellow, red, white, earth, water, fire, wind, base of infinite space, base of infinite consciousness. The Hīnayāna says: the first eight totality bases have non-greed as their nature because they counteract greed. The latter two totality bases have the four aggregates as their nature. The Mahāyāna says: they have concentration and wisdom as their nature. Because their objects are vast, the subjective understanding and resolution are also vast and boundless, hence called "totality bases." Previous translators called "base" as "entrance" and "totality" as "all," hence "all-entrances." "Eight removal-entrances" refers to the third virtue of eight mastery bases. First, having internal form-perception and observing external

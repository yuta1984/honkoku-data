mutual interpenetration. Third, regarding Buddha-lands and hair-pores—the mutual interpenetration of one and many. Fourth, regarding Mount Sumeru and mustard seeds—the mutual interpenetration of coarse and subtle. Fifth, regarding ordinary beings and saints—the mutual interpenetration of inner and outer. Question: Mount Sumeru and great seas entering into mustard seeds—coarse and subtle are contradictory, so how can they enter? The explanation says: The various masters of the West briefly make three interpretations. First, they say: Everything takes suchness as its essence. Since the suchness upon which [things] depend is free from all characteristics, the dependent dharmas have no fixed size. Second, they say: All dharmas do not depart from consciousness. Following what the mind transforms, there are also no fixed characteristics. Third, they say: All dharmas, through the principle of causation, all have no fixed characteristics. Through this principle, large and small interpenetrate, and one moment becomes many eons. One should understand according to this. If so, the three incalculable eons should have no difference. Why then does one become Buddha through cultivation over three僧祇? The answer is: This difficulty is not valid. It is not the realm of ordinary beings and others. The Yogācāra texts say: Those who forcibly contemplate the inconceivable receive deluded and confused retribution.

The sutra says: "Buddha-bodies are inconceivable, sentient beings' bodies are inconceivable, worlds are inconceivable." The interpretation says: From here below is repeated praise. The Buddha-body is namely the previous one Buddha-body. Sentient beings are namely the previous sentient beings and six paths. Worlds are namely the four great [elements] and the previous four types of transformations.

The sutra says: "When the Buddha manifested spiritual powers, the devas and humans of the ten directions attained Buddha-flower samādhi, ten Ganges-sands of bodhisattvas achieved Buddhahood in their present bodies, three Ganges-sands of spirit kings of the eight classes achieved the bodhisattva path, and ten thousand women attained spiritual-power samādhi in their present bodies." The interpretation says: At this time the assembly gained benefit. Regarding this, there are four types that can be understood. Question: Do many Buddhas appear simultaneously in one world? Answer: Even wheel-turning kings do not [appear simultaneously], much less Buddhas. Question: If so, how do ten Ganges-sands of bodhisattvas achieve Buddhahood in their present bodies? Answer: They do not achieve [Buddhahood] in their present bodies, but in their present bodies they go to other worlds

and achieve Buddhahood. Like in the Lotus Sutra, the dragon girl in her present body went to another realm and achieved Buddhahood. This should also be so. Question: If so, how do we reconcile the statement in the Accepting and Maintaining Chapter that "one thousand billion bodhisattvas presently achieved perfect enlightenment"? Answer: The name "Buddha" extends to the ten stages. The Mahāprajñāpāramitā says: It explains the ten stages and names them the ten types of Buddhas. Attaining bodhi at the first stage is also the same meaning.

The sutra says: "Good men, this Prajñāpāramitā has benefits for the three times: the past has already explained it, the present now explains it, the future will explain it. Listen carefully, listen carefully, think well upon it, and cultivate according to the dharma." The interpretation says: From here below, it praises the benefits of prajñā and encourages cultivation. This can be understood from the text.

Accepting and Maintaining Chapter Seven

In interpreting this chapter, there are briefly two meanings. First, interpreting the chapter name. Second, correctly interpreting the text. Interpreting the chapter name: According to the Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom, through the power of faith, hearing and practicing accordingly is called "accepting." Through the power of mindfulness, not losing the text for a long time is called "maintaining." This chapter clarifies that thirteen types of dharma teachers accept and maintain prajñā and also cause others to accept it. It is called the Accepting and Maintaining Chapter.

The sutra says: "At that time, Sunlight contemplated in his mind and spoke with his mouth: 'I see Śākyamuni Buddha manifesting limitless spiritual powers, and I also see Treasure-Fulfillment Buddha on the thousand-flower platform—he is the master of the transformation bodies of all Buddhas. I also see Buddhas on the thousand-flower-petal worlds. The various Buddhas within them each explain Prajñāpāramitā.'" The interpretation says: Second, correctly interpreting according to the text. In the previous five chapters, the essential doctrine was completed. Therefore, the following two chapters follow the teaching in maintaining it. Within this there are two parts. First, clarifying accepting and maintaining. Second, clarifying entrustment. This is the first part. Within one chapter, first through questions and answers it explains the ten

three dharma teachers, next it entrusts the king to accept and maintain, and finally the assembly at that time gains benefit. Vairocana means "illumination." The pure land of the reward-body Buddha pervades throughout the dharma realm. Or it can be translated by meaning as "Treasure-Fulfillment"—this is the master of transformation bodies. The Brahmā Net Sutra says: "I am now Vairocana, seated squarely on the lotus platform," etc. This is precisely the meaning.

The sutra says: "He addressed the Buddha saying: 'Such limitless Prajñāpāramitā is inexplicable, incomprehensible, and cannot be known through consciousness.'" The interpretation says: From here below, second, he speaks forth and makes a request. First praising, then requesting. Because it transcends verbal explanation, it is called "inexplicable." Because it transcends conceptual mind, it is called "incomprehensible." Because it transcends reasoning and investigation, it is called "cannot be known through consciousness." This can be understood according to the above.

The sutra says: "How can good men clearly awaken and understand within this sutra, and according to the dharma open the path of emptiness-dharma for all sentient beings?" The interpretation says: This is precisely the request. "Opening" means revealing and developing. "Path" means the holy path. "Emptiness-dharma" means personal emptiness and dharma emptiness.

The sutra says: "The Great Sage said: 'There are good men who cultivate the thirteen contemplation gates and become great dharma kings.'" The interpretation says: The Tathāgata correctly explains.

The sutra says: "From practicing patience to the vajra summit, all become dharma teachers who provide support and establishment." The interpretation says: Second, separate exposition. "Support" means what is depended upon; "maintaining" means gathering and upholding. They become what the assembly depends upon, are able to gather and uphold the assembly, and establish the true dharma.

The sutra says: "You great assembly should make offerings to them as you would make Buddha-offerings. You should hold hundreds of millions of heavenly flowers and heavenly incense and offer them up." The interpretation says: Third, encouraging offerings. This can be understood.

The sutra says: "Good men, these dharma teachers..." The interpretation says: Separately interpreting the thirteen dharma teachers. First general, then

specific.

The sutra says: "These are all seed-nature bodhisattvas." The interpretation says: From here below, sequentially interpreting separately. It is divided into thirteen sections. This is namely the first dharma teacher.

The sutra says: "Whether laypeople—upāsakas and upāsikās—or renunciants—monks and nuns." The interpretation says: Distinguishing the differences in categories. "Upāsaka" is a corruption and abbreviation. Correctly it is called "upāsaka"—this means "near-serving man." "Upāsikā"—this means "near-serving woman."

The sutra says: "Cultivating the ten wholesome [actions]." The interpretation says: Practicing the ten wholesome actions such as not killing. This is the inner ordinary being, suppressing patience, the faith of the ten abodes.

The sutra says: "Observing one's own body of earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness as impure part by part." The interpretation says: Cultivating the contemplation of impurity. There are naturally three types: the six great [elements], the sense faculties, and the three realms. All are conditioned and subject to destruction, therefore called impure. Because each is observed separately, it says "part by part."

The sutra says: "Moreover, observing the fourteen faculties—namely the five senses, five receptors, male and female, mind, life, etc.—because they have limitless faults, immediately arousing the unsurpassed bodhi mind." The interpretation says: This is the contemplation of the impurity of faculties. Among the twenty-two faculties, the five faculties of faith etc. and the three undefiled faculties are all purely wholesome in nature and are not mentioned among the faults. The five faculties have five consciousnesses and five senses, therefore called "five senses." This should be understood according to the above.

The sutra says: "Always cultivating the contemplation gate of impurity patience because all moments and thoughts of the three realms are impure." The interpretation says: This is observing the three realms. The Yogācāra treatise says: There are six types of impurity. First, decaying and defiling impurity. Naturally there are

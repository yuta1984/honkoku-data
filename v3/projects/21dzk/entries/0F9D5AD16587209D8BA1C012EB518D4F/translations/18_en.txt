The sutra (possibly missing the character "在" after "経") [speaks of] foreign countries. They do not come to this land. This sage leads the various ghosts and spirits. The ghosts and spirits fundamentally have ten divisions, with each division having ten divisions. Therefore it is called one hundred divisions. The fundamental ten are: First, Great Spirit, able to transform and create various spirits. Second, Child Spirit - Maheśvara's child transforms into a sage. Because the sage's law does not kill small children. The sage records age sixteen, upon becoming adult one must die. Maheśvara keeps this child perpetually at age fourteen. Taking small children as his faction, he harms small children in the world. If [a child] reaches age fifteen, this child no longer harms. Third, Mother Spirit - the child's wet nurse. Fourth, Brahma Spirit - Maheśvara has three eyes on his face and possesses omniscience. If something is lost and one cannot cast spells, another eye grows on the child's face. [The child] goes directly to take the object, and when the object returns, loses the eye. Fifth, Elephant-head Spirit - from jealousy obstructs all good and evil affairs of others, wishing them not to succeed. Sixth, Dragon Spirit - having much greed and anger. Seventh, Asura - necessarily violates humans and devas, having good and evil strength. Eighth, Sand Spirit - having little merit, body like sand and earth. Ninth, Yakṣa Spirit - possessing great supernatural powers. Tenth, Rākṣasa Spirit - translated as "extremely difficult." Speaking of "one hundred divisions" refers to ghost-spirit kings. "Each division again having one hundred divisions of ghosts and spirits" refers to the retinues of the previous spirits. Ghosts and spirits all desire to obtain human form. They do not propagate [the dharma] but prefer causing harm. When this sutra is lectured within the nation, the various ghosts and spirits all come to protect the nation in order to hear the dharma, causing there to be no seven disasters. Because there are no seven disasters, one can lecture and listen. Therefore it says "they enjoy hearing this sutra." Master Tong says: These various ghost-spirit kings cannot listen to the dharma in the same place because they have much jealousy. Adding today's interpretation: According to this commentary text, it is not possible in one place, so it must be taught separately. Lecturing all Mahāyāna is like this, not only this

sutra alone. Since the sutra text says "one hundred divisions of ghosts and spirits, each of these divisions again having one hundred divisions, enjoying hearing this sutra, protecting your nation," today's interpretation says: According to this sutra text, beyond one hundred seats, should one also additionally be able to lecture and recite this sutra? Because there are many spirits and so forth.

The sutra says: "Great King, when the nation is in disorder, first the ghosts and spirits are disordered; because ghosts and spirits are disordered, the myriad people are disordered; thieves come to plunder the nation; the hundred surnames perish and are lost; ministers, lords, crown princes, princes, kings, princes, and hundred officials together generate right and wrong; heaven and earth [show] strange anomalies; the twenty-eight constellations, star-paths, sun and moon lose their timing and degrees; many thieves arise." The interpretation says: Fourth, clarifying the disasters to be protected against. First, disasters of ghosts and such; next, disasters of three calamities; later, distinguishing protection against disasters. Initially there are eight disasters: first, ghost disorder; second, human disorder; third, thieves coming; fourth, people perishing; fifth, right and wrong among lords and ministers; sixth, strange anomalies of heaven and earth; seventh, constellations losing their degrees; eighth, sun and moon losing their degrees. Master Zang says: Also, the one hundred divisions of ghosts and spirits enjoy hearing the true dharma. Because sutras are not lectured in that nation, the various ghosts and spirits become angry, therefore raising seven disasters and troubling the nation. The twenty-eight constellations are: Jiǎo, Kàng, Dǐ, Fáng, Xīn, Wěi, Jī - these are eastern constellations. Dǒu, Niú, Nǚ, Xū, Wēi, Shì, Bì - these are northern constellations. Kuí, Lóu, Wèi, Mǎo, Bì, Zī, Shēn - these are western constellations. Jǐng, Guǐ, Liǔ, Xīng, Zhāng, Yì, Zhěn - these are southern constellations. Each direction has seven, four times seven making twenty-eight constellations. "Stars" refers to the seven stars: Pòjūn, Wǔqū, Liánzhēn, Lùcún, Wénqū, Jùmén, Tānláng stars. "Losing degrees" means the above degree-numbers are in disorder, therefore called losing degrees. Sun and moon losing degrees means heaven has 356 degrees, traveling one degree per day. In one year [they] complete one circuit of heaven. The measure of one degree is 2,932 li, 70

【Left page, upper section】
1 bu, 2 chi, 7 cun, 4 fen and a large half. One explanation says 3,932 li. The moon travels eleven degrees in one day and night. One explanation says thirteen degrees. In the human-deva path, where sun and moon travel, there are indeed immeasurable [variations]. Generally there are three paths: namely, the winter solstice day travels the southern path; the summer solstice day travels the northern path; the spring and autumn equinoxes travel the middle path. Mistakenly returning to normal degrees, the sun and moon's waxing and waning, the constellations losing degrees - these manifest inauspicious signs. In such times of change, if one can lecture and recite Mahāyāna and take refuge in the Three Jewels, following merit to dispel disasters, the sun and stars return to their paths. Therefore it says "also expound this sutra."

The sutra says: "Great King, if there are fire disasters, water disasters, wind disasters, all various disasters." The interpretation says: This clarifies disasters of three calamities and such.

The sutra says: "Also should lecture and recite this sutra. The dharma methods are as above." The interpretation says: According to the above, this can be known.

The sutra says: "Great King, not only protecting the nation, but also protecting merit - seeking wealth, honor, official position, the seven treasures' as-you-wish coming and going, seeking sons and daughters, seeking wisdom, understanding, and fame, seeking the fruit-rewards of the six heavens, the fruit-joy of nine grades among humans - also lecture and recite this sutra. The dharma methods are as explained above." The interpretation says: Second, determining the protection of dharma. Speaking of "nine grades" means upper, middle, and lower each having three grades, combined to make nine types. Within the upper grade's upper, middle, and lower: upper grade is path-seed-nature with gold wheel-king; middle grade is nature-seed-nature with silver wheel-king; lower grade is habit-seed-nature with copper wheel-king. Within the middle grade's upper, middle, and lower: upper grade is iron wheel-king; middle grade is scattered-millet king;

lower grade is small nation king. Within the lower grade's upper, middle, and lower: upper grade is kṣatriya nature; middle grade is brahmin nature; lower grade is householder and such. Through nine grades of good, one experiences various pleasant matters. Specifically as explained above, this can be known by analogy.

The sutra says: "Great King, not only protecting merit but also protecting various disasters." The interpretation says: Third, clarifying protection from various disasters. First establishing, next interpreting, later applying.

The sutra says: "If illness, shared disasters, shackles and chains binding one's body, breaking the four heavy prohibitions, creating causes of five grave offenses, committing sins of eight difficulties, performing affairs of the six paths - all countless sufferings and disasters." The interpretation says: Separately interpreting the first disaster. Speaking of "four heavy [prohibitions]" means sexual misconduct, stealing, killing, lying. Generally, when bhikṣus violate heavy prohibitions, regarding loss and non-loss, one should make four statements: First, definitely not abandoning precepts, as in Sarvāstivāda. Second, definitely abandoning precepts, as in Sautrāntika school and Yogācāra etc. Third, both abandoning and not abandoning, as in Nirvāṇa Sutra etc. Fourth, neither abandoning nor not abandoning, as in Expedient Means Sutra etc. If one repents, [precepts] are not abandoned; if one does not repent, they are then abandoned. In this sutra text, even the four heavy [offenses] and five grave [offenses] can accomplish the meaning of protection. The Contemplation of Amitāyus Sutra says "Those with five grave [offenses] are also born in the Western [Pure Land]." The Nirvāṇa Sutra's Pure Conduct chapter says "King Ajātaśatru aroused bodhicitta and did not enter hell. Because he aroused great mind, all heavy sins immediately became slight." Extensive explanation should be known. Speaking of "eight difficulties" means: first, hell; second, animals; third, hungry ghosts; fourth, blind and deaf; fifth, before and after Buddha; sixth, worldly intelligence and eloquence; seventh, Uttarakuru continent; eighth, long-life heaven. Speaking of "performing affairs of the six paths" means creating karma of the six paths. Speaking of "all countless sufferings and disasters" means generally concluding various disasters.

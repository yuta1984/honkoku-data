When they depart, the seven disasters will inevitably arise. The commentary says: This explains the reason for the exhortation. Paramārtha says: "Serving five hundred Buddhas to become emperor" - this is a partial explanation. After more than one hundred great kalpas, through diligent cultivation and effort, one encounters five hundred Buddhas. This person generates bodhicitta and enters the initial ten faiths. This discussion concerns such kings, not other kings. The reason is as follows: Aniruddha served one pratyekabuddha and became Indra thirty-six times and a wheel-turning king thirty-six times. King Mandhatā, during the time of Dīpaṅkara Buddha, was a merchant leader who wished to make offerings to the Buddha but suddenly could not proceed. He threw five beans with his hand toward the Buddha, saying, "I am a person of merit. Let them enter the Buddha's bowl." Four beans entered, one fell. Through the merit of four beans he became king of the four continents; one bean falling to the ground indicated that he would eventually fall from Trāyastriṃśa heaven. Obtaining heavenly status by serving five hundred Buddhas is not for ordinary people. The heavenly prince enters the ten understandings and encounters five hundred Buddhas. This demonstrates the meaning of causal encouragement. "Arhat" refers to sudden liberation - though in the learning stage, one achieves arhatship in the present body.

The sutra says: "Great King, if in future worlds there are kings who protect the Three Jewels, I will send five great powerful bodhisattvas to protect their countries." Commentary: This discusses future protection.

explanations.

The sutra says: "These five great beings and five thousand great demon spirit kings will create great benefit in your country. You should establish images and make offerings to them." Commentary: This concludes the explanation encouraging offerings.

The sutra says: "Great King, I now entrust the Three Jewels to you and all other kings." Commentary: Calling by name and entrusting.

The sutra says: "Vaiśālī country, Kośala country, Śrāvastī country, Magadha country, Vārāṇasī country, Kapilavastu country, Kuśinagara country, Kauśāmbī country, Kuru country, Kashmir country, Gandhāra country, Gandhāra country, Śātavāhana country, Saṅghaṭa country, Karnasauvarṇa country, Pāṭaliputra country." Commentary: Lists names according to excellence. However, the names of the sixteen great countries differ in Sanskrit pronunciation between the Mahāvaipulya Sūtra and the Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā and cannot be reconciled.

The sutra says: "All such kings should receive and maintain the Prajñāpāramitā." Commentary: Concludes the exhortation to maintain it.

The sutra says: "At that time, the great assembly and the Asura kings heard what the Buddha taught about seven fearsome disasters in future worlds, their body hair stood on end, they cried out loudly saying, 'May we not be born in those countries!'" Commentary: The assembly received benefit. "Seven fearsome disasters" refers to the seven disasters mentioned earlier.

The sutra says: "At that time, the sixteen great kings immediately entrusted state affairs to their younger brothers and renounced the world to cultivate the Way." Commentary: Below discusses the human kings' benefits. "Entrusting the country to younger brothers" means renouncing worldly life.

The sutra says: "Observing the four elements and four colors' characteristics of mastery and transcendence." Commentary: Below separately clarifies cultivation of the Way - the differences in arising contemplation. Within this there are four: first, eight masteries; second, ten totalities; third, first ground characteristics; fourth, nine grounds characteristics. This is the first. Observing earth, water, fire, wind - these are the productive colors. Blue, yellow, red, white - these are the produced colors. Together called the eight masteries. Mastering the objective realm and mastering afflictions, hence called "masteries." Departing from and transcending greed, hence called "mastery and transcendence." "Characteristics" means essential characteristics, also behavioral characteristics, also understanding characteristics.

The sutra says: "The four elements, four colors, non-utilization, consciousness, space - entering behavioral characteristics." Commentary: The second ten totalities. The previous eight colors, like space-sphere and consciousness-sphere, are also called "ten totalities." "Entering" is the "sphere." The objective conditions are broad and vast without intervals, hence called "totalities." "Non-utilization" comes from following the language. Master Zang says: "Non-utilization" refers to the sphere of nothingness. "Consciousness" is the consciousness-sphere, "space" is the space-sphere. These three together make ten spheres. The reason for not explaining the eight liberations is that these three categories of dharmas are contemplated by those of lower, middle, and upper faculties. Here there are only middle and upper faculties, no lower grade, hence they are not explained.

The sutra says: "Thirty forbearances, first ground characteristics." Commentary: The third first ground characteristics. The thirty minds before the grounds are called "thirty forbearances." This is the preparatory characteristics of the first ground.

The sutra says: "Ultimate truth, nine grounds characteristics." Commentary: The fourth nine grounds characteristics. The first ground realizes principle,境智平等 (境 and wisdom are equal), called "ultimate meaning." With the later nine grounds, it creates their causal characteristics, called "nine grounds characteristics." Obtaining the true wisdom of the first ground, the illnesses of all grounds should be accomplished.

The sutra says: "Therefore, Great King, abandon the ordinary being's body and enter the six dwelling bodies, abandon the seven reward bodies and enter the eight dharma bodies, realizing all practices of Prajñāpāramitā." Commentary: This concludes and accomplishes realization. "Abandoning the ordinary being's body" means abandoning the pre-ground body. "Entering the six dwelling bodies" means entering the first ground up to the sixth ground body. This is abandoning ordinary beings and entering the sage stage. "Seven reward bodies" means abandoning the seventh ground's birth-and-death body. The seventh ground still has a flesh body. "Entering the eight dharma bodies" means entering the transformation dharma body of the eighth ground and above. "All practices, etc." clarifies that dharma body and myriad practices are together. Alternatively, it generally explains the practices of the ten grounds.

The sutra says: "Eighteen Brahmā gods and Asura kings attained the three vehicle contemplation, sharing the same no-birth realm." Commentary: The benefits for Brahmā gods and others. According to their faculties they attain three vehicle contemplation, contemplating the principle of no-birth of persons and dharmas as their object.

"Accordance flowers" represent accordance-forbearance. The fourth, fifth, sixth grounds accord with no-birth. "No-birth flowers" represent the lower

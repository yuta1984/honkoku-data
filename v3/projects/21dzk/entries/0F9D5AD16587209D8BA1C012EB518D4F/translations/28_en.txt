Comparing the various stages and distinguishing their differences. From the ten faiths to the vajra stage, the ālaya consciousness has not yet been abandoned. Therefore it is said to be subduing.

The sutra says: "Yet through signless faith, one extinguishes all afflictions, generates liberation wisdom, and illuminates the first principle truth." The interpretation says: This manifests the meaning of severance. "Signless" means uncontaminated. Because there are no contaminated characteristics, it is called "signless." Namely, signless faith becomes the uninterrupted path, severing all afflictions, accomplishing the liberation path, and seeing the first principle truth.

The sutra says: "Not called 'seeing'—what is called 'seeing' is sarvajña." The interpretation says: The difference between faith and seeing. Except for the Buddha, before that one only speaks of faith, not called seeing. What is called seeing is all-knowledge.

The sutra says: "Therefore I have always said from the beginning that only Buddha has knowledge, seeing, and awakening; from the consecration samādhi down to habit patience, they do not know, see, or awaken." The interpretation says: Citing to establish this. Although knowledge, seeing, and awakening penetrate cause and effect, now speaking from the superior perspective, they exist only in Buddha.

The sutra says: "Only Buddha has sudden understanding, not called faith—one who gradually subdues." The interpretation says: The difference between gradual and sudden. Buddha severs all obstructions, while others do not.

The sutra says: "Although wisdom arises and ceases, it is able to be birthless and deathless; if this mind ceases, then there are no burdens that do not cease—birthless and deathless." The interpretation says: The difference between permanent and impermanent, uninterrupted and liberated. Regarding this, Buddha's wisdom—permanent and impermanent—each speaks as permanent.

The sutra says: "Entering the principle-exhaustion vajra samādhi, identical with the true limit, equal to dharma-nature, yet unable to equal the unequaled-equal." The interpretation

says: The difference between equal and unequaled, uninterrupted and liberated. Namely, entering the principle-exhaustion vajra samādhi, pure and undefiled, identical with post-path thusness, and equal to pre-path dharma-nature thusness. "Yet unable to equal the unequaled-equal" means except for Buddha and below, not reaching Buddha, therefore called "unequaled." Being equal with all Buddhas, therefore called "equal." Before vajra, none can equal the unequaled-equal.

The sutra says: "Like a person ascending a great high platform and observing all below without anything unclear." The interpretation says: Raising an analogy for understanding.

The sutra says: "Dwelling in principle-exhaustion samādhi is also like this." The interpretation says: Combining analogy and principle.

The sutra says: "Always cultivating all practices, fulfilling merit, entering the Bhagavat stage, also always dwelling in Buddha-wisdom samādhi." The interpretation says: Entering stage and dwelling in concentration. In this stage, cultivating the six perfections, etc., fulfilling the merit treasury. "Bhagavat" is called "World-Honored One." Because of contemplating the three bodies, one can speak of perfection. Master Jing says: translates as "fruit perfection." Also called "able giver." This has five meanings: first, fearless—not being weary of birth and death; second, unsettled—not dwelling in nirvana; third, unsatisfied—always transforming without rest; fourth, unattached—dedicating gifts without attachment; fifth, non-discriminating—taking others' affairs as one's own affairs. Master Zang says: translates as "giving virtue." Namely, through being able to rain clouds, teaching dharma, possessing concentration and wisdom, called "Buddha-wisdom samādhi."

The sutra says: "Good son, such bodhisattvas are all able to transform sentient beings in all Buddha-lands of the ten directions, correctly speak correct meaning, receive, hold, recite, and understand the true characteristics exactly like me today without difference." The interpretation says: Third, concluding praise. Superior virtues are not different from Buddha.

The sutra says: "Buddha told King Prasenajit: When I pass into extinction and the dharma is about to perish completely, all kings should receive and uphold this Prajñāpāramitā." The interpretation says: From here, second section: entrusting to kings for upholding. Namely, when my true dharma perishes, receiving and upholding this one section of the Humane Kings Prajñā.

The sutra says: "Greatly accomplishing Buddha-works, all lands established in peace, myriad people happy—all due to this Prajñāpāramitā." The interpretation says: The reason for encouraging upholding. There are three types: first, greatly accomplishing Buddha-works—namely, extinguishing evil and generating good; second, establishing lands in peace; third, myriad people happy.

The sutra says: "Therefore entrusted to all kings, not entrusted to monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen." The interpretation says: Concluding entrustment to all kings. Master Jing says: making the dharma dwell long. Dwelling has ten matters: first, respecting dharma; second, respecting teachers; third, respecting communities; fourth, able to support; fifth, able to write; sixth, able to listen; seventh, able to contemplate; eighth, able to practice; ninth, able to expound; tenth, able to request. All due to royal power.

The sutra says: "Why is this so?" The interpretation says: Outsiders' challenge and conclusion.

The sutra says: "Because of lacking royal authority, therefore not entrusted—you should receive, uphold, recite, and understand the meaning and principle." The interpretation says: The fourfold assembly lacks authority like kings, therefore this sutra is not entrusted to them. They can only cultivate and study.

The sutra says: "Great King, what I now transform: a hundred billion Mount Sumerus, a hundred billion suns and moons, each Sumeru having four continents, in the southern Jambudvīpa having sixteen great countries, five hundred middle countries, ten thousand small countries—in these lands there are seven fearsome difficulties. All kings, for the sake of these difficulties, lecturing and reciting Prajñāpāramitā, the seven difficulties

immediately cease, seven blessings immediately arise, myriad people are happy, and emperors rejoice." The interpretation says: From here broadly praising and encouraging upholding. "Seven blessings" means reversing the previous seven difficulties to make seven blessings: first, myriad people love and honor the king; second, the four seas submit; third, enemies retreat and scatter; fourth, the king loves himself; fifth, the four directions sing praise; sixth, present abundance and joy; seventh, should enter the good path.

The sutra says: "What constitute difficulties?" The interpretation says: Question and answer distinction. First question, then answer.

The sutra says: "Sun and moon losing their course, seasons reversing, or red sun appearing, black sun appearing, two, three, four, five suns appearing, or solar eclipse without light, or sun disk appearing as one ring, two, three, four, five rings—when such strange transformations occur, reading and expounding this sutra constitutes the first difficulty." The interpretation says: This is the answer. There are altogether fourteen difficulties, generally made into the first difficulty. When seasons transform abnormally, it mostly brings famine; when numbers transform abnormally, it mostly brings warfare; when colors and forms transform abnormally, it mostly brings disease.

The sutra says: "The twenty-eight constellations losing their course, Venus, comet star, wheel star, ghost star, Mars, Mercury, wind star, sword star, Southern Dipper, Northern Dipper, the five regulatory great stars, all sovereign stars, three ministers stars, hundred officials stars—when all such stars each transform and appear strangely, reading and expounding this sutra also constitutes the second difficulty." The interpretation says: The second stellar transformation calamity difficulty. Dharma Master Di and Master Zang say: stellar abnormalities, third fire disasters, fourth water disasters, fifth wind disasters, sixth drought disasters, seventh bandit disasters. Within the first sun and moon difficulty there are fourteen: first, clearly losing course—not following the constant path is called losing course; second, clearly seasons reversing; third, red sun appearing; fourth, black sun appearing; fifth, two suns appearing; sixth, three suns appearing; seventh, four suns appearing; eighth, five

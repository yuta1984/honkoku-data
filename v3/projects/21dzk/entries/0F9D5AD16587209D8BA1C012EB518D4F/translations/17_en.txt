"Should uphold prajñāpāramitā." The interpretation says: From below, properly interpreting according to the text. Being able to protect Buddha-fruit and the practices of the ten grounds are all internal protection. Protecting what belongs to humans and devas is external protection. Above we have already interpreted two types of internal protection. Therefore now we clarify the Protecting the Nation chapter in two parts. Within this one chapter, the text is divided into three sections: first, commanding listening and encouraging upholding; next, extensively interpreting dharma-protection; later, discussing the assembly obtaining benefits. This is the first section.

The sutra says: "When the nation is about to be disturbed and destroyed, burned by calamities, and thieves come to destroy the nation." The interpretation says: From below, the second extensive interpretation. Within it there are three parts: first, extensively interpreting dharma-protection; next, citing the ancient to證 the present; later, concluding and demonstrating to encourage upholding. This is the first part. According to reality, protecting the nation extends through all times. To manifest critical times, it mentions calamity-burning, thieves, etc., and correspondingly explains dharma-protection. Speaking of "calamity-burning" means harming the nation, therefore named calamity-burning. It is not the fire disaster among the three disasters. Because when the three disasters arise, there are no sentient beings.

The sutra says: "Should invite one hundred Buddha images, one hundred bodhisattva images, one hundred arhat images." The interpretation says: From below interpreting the method of dharma-protection. First protecting merit-fields, next clarifying offerings, later manifesting the time of teaching. The text is divided into three parts: first inviting merit-fields, next inviting listeners, later inviting teachers. This is the first part. The aforementioned three honored ones in actual form are difficult to gather. To reach distant eras, making merit-fields complete, therefore placing one hundred images. Master Tong says: If during Buddha's lifetime, also invite actual bodies of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and arhats.

The sutra says: "One hundred bhikṣu assembly and four great assemblies should listen to this sutra together." The interpretation says: From below clarifying the teaching assembly. There are three types of listeners: first, one hundred bhikṣus; second, one hundred four great assemblies; third, one hundred seven assemblies. Speaking of "one hundred bhikṣus": one explanation says that before each seat there are one hundred bhikṣus. If so, this would become ten thousand people. When people

are insufficient, the dharma teaching cannot be accomplished. Now saying "one hundred" means that before each seat there is one bhikṣu. Because we examine and verify the listeners, we say one hundred. Speaking of "four great assemblies" means bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās. One explanation says to exclude śrāmaṇeras, śrāmaṇerīs, and śikṣamāṇās. Now we say this is not so. They are already included within the bhikṣu and bhikṣuṇī assemblies, therefore we do not mention them again. Speaking of "seven assemblies" means adding the three assemblies of śrāmaṇeras etc. to the previous four assemblies. Therefore the seven assemblies are assemblies that come and go. Question: Before each seat there are six relatives, all having hundreds in number. What is the meaning of this? The explanation says: Because we want to adorn the dharma-teaching assembly. Question: The four great assemblies etc. already include bhikṣus. Why is it necessary to separately mention one hundred bhikṣus? Answer: To show that in each assembly, one person is definitely needed to serve as the presiding elder. Therefore we say one hundred. Question: What difference is there between four great assemblies and seven assemblies? Because the explanatory approaches differ, they are explained [separately]. There is not necessarily a difference. Or possibly, the four great assemblies are all Mahāyāna assemblies. Speaking of "seven assemblies" refers to śrāvaka assemblies. Master Fan says: At each seat location, there are one hundred assemblies each. Speaking of "four great assemblies" has multiple interpretations, namely nāga-elephant assemblies, frontier assemblies, learned assemblies, and virtuous assemblies. Master Tong says: Why among dharma-teachers and other seven types do we invite only one hundred dharma-teachers? Because in the nation there are one hundred groups of ghost-spirit kings who listen to dharma in different assemblies and cannot be in the same place. Yet we also invite seven types to create seven merit-fields to block seven disasters. In the final age, seven disasters are numerous. Speaking of "seven disasters" is as explained below. Speaking of "seven merit-fields" means: first, one hundred Buddha images; second, one hundred bodhisattva images; third, one hundred arhat images; fourth, one hundred bhikṣus; fifth, four great assemblies (namely bhikṣus etc.); sixth, seven assemblies (adding śrāmaṇeras, śrāmaṇerīs, and śikṣamāṇās to the previous four assemblies); seventh, one hundred dharma-teachers.

The sutra says: "Should invite one hundred dharma-teachers to lecture prajñāpāramitā." The interpretation says: Clarifying inviting teachers to expound the dharma.

The sutra says: "Before one hundred lion-roar high seats, light one hundred lamps, burn one hundred mixed incenses, [offer] one hundred varieties of colored flowers to make offerings to the Three Jewels." The interpretation says: Clarifying the method of making offerings. Briefly there are three types: namely lamps, incense, and flowers. Speaking of "one hundred lamps etc." means before each seat there are one lamp, one incense, and one flower respectively. If not so, it would become ten thousand flowers, and such an affair would be difficult to accomplish. Adding today's interpretation: Since the sutra text says "one hundred mixed incenses, one hundred varieties of flowers to make offerings to the Three Jewels," Master Ce says: Before each seat one incense and one colored flower each. If [supplies] are insufficient, this should suffice for now. If [one can] fully provide, then for each seat separately, completely offer one hundred varieties. Considering the meaning and reasoning, this accords with principle, therefore it should definitely be practiced.

The sutra says: "With the three robes and various implements make offerings to dharma-teachers; small meals and midday food should also be provided at appropriate times." The interpretation says: Second, the method of separate offerings. Speaking of "various implements": there are two interpretations of this. First, traditional explanation says: three robes making three, bowl four, sitting mat five, razor six, knife seven, water-strainer bag eight, bowl bag nine, needle case ten. Second, Pure Tripiṭaka says: "three robes and ten implements" is probably a translator's error. Although having two places, not following the Sanskrit original, separately explaining three robes divided into ten implements. Interpreting "various" as "mixed" is extremely arbitrary conjecture. The thirteen requisites additionally include middle and lower [grades]. Speaking of "thirteen requisites" means: first saṃghāṭī, second uttarāsaṃga, third antarvāsa, fourth niṣīdana,

【Left page, lower section】
fifth naidaśana, sixth razor naidaśana, seventh saṃkakṣikā, eighth razor saṃkakṣikā, ninth parīśaśarīkā, tenth kāyapracchādana, eleventh mukhapracchadana, twelfth keśapratīgrāha, thirteenth kṣatapratīcchādana. Master Zang says: "Various implements" means three robes, bowl, sitting mat, razor, brown cloth, one knife, crow-[feather], water-strainer bag, needle case. Master Fan says: Speaking of "various implements" means generally mentioning large numbers, therefore saying "various implements," like "one hundred and one body-supporting implements" etc. Also, "various" is interpreted as "mixed," namely referring to miscellaneous items outside the three robes. Speaking of "small meals" means provisionally speaking according to light food, then it includes cakes, fruits, porridge, food, etc. Only making offerings to dharma-teachers is because dharma-teachers are considered important. Therefore only making offerings to dharma-teachers. Speaking according to reality, it extends to making offerings to other assemblies as well.

The sutra says: "Great King, twice daily should lecture and recite this sutra." The interpretation says: The time divisions for lecturing sutras. Because strength is necessarily needed, following two meals, lectures are also at two times. Master Zang says: Morning and afternoon make two times. Adding today's interpretation: Since the sutra text says "twice daily lecture and recite this sutra," the locations are not uniform. According to this sutra text, should there necessarily be two teachers for lecturing and recitation?

The sutra says: "In your nation there are one hundred groups of ghosts and spirits; each of these groups has another one hundred groups; they enjoy hearing this sutra; these various ghosts and spirits will protect your nation." The interpretation says: Third, clarifying their protective capability. According to the original record and Master Zang, citing the Tripiṭaka: "one hundred groups of ghosts and spirits" appears in the Gold-Silver Sage Meaning Sutra. This

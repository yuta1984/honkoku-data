This is [Aṅgulimā]la.

The sutra says: "King Spotted-Feet granted this for one day." The interpretation says: Second, granting leave for one day. In the Wise and Foolish Sutra, it grants this for seven days.

The sutra says: "At that time King Universal Brightness, following the dharma of the past seven Buddhas, invited one hundred dharma masters, spread out one hundred high seats, and in one day at two times completed lecturing on 8 billion verses of Prajñāpāramitā." The interpretation says: From here below, third, being able to protect according to the time. Question: How could 8 billion verses be explained in one day? Answer: Through the Buddha's invisible blessing, therefore it could be explained.

The sutra says: "The first dharma master spoke verses for King Universal Brightness, saying:" The interpretation says: Following the separate principle to clarify the ability to protect. The first verse is in prose form.

The sutra says: "When the kalpa's burning is finished, heaven and earth blaze completely; Mount Sumeru and vast seas all become scattered ashes; the merit of devas and dragons is exhausted, withering and perishing within; even the two principles [heaven and earth] decay—what permanence does a country have?" The interpretation says: Second, correctly interpreting dharma protection. There are eight verses explaining four principles. The first two verses explain the principle of impermanence. The second two verses explain the principle of suffering. The third two verses explain the principle of emptiness. The fourth two verses explain the principle of no-self. In the first section, the first verse clarifies the physical world, the next half-verse [deals with] sentient beings, the next half-verse raises the superior to compare with the inferior. Speaking of "kalpa's burning is finished" means the fire disaster has just arisen, beginning from the wind wheel up to the first dhyāna, therefore it says "finished." Speaking of "qian" means heaven—firm. Heaven's movement does not cease, therefore it is called qian. "Kun" means earth—compliant. Earth complies with the four seasons and gives birth to and nourishes all things, therefore it is called kun. Heaven and earth burn completely,

therefore it is called "blazing completely." Mount Sumeru and vast seas refer to mountains and waters in contrast.

The sutra says: "Birth, old age, sickness, and death cycle without end; when affairs go against wishes, worry and grief cause harm; desires are deep and calamities heavy, like sores and warts without exterior; the three realms are all suffering—what reliance does a country have?" The interpretation says: The second two verses interpret the characteristics of various sufferings. Speaking of "affairs go against wishes" refers to the suffering of meeting with enemies and hatred, the suffering of separation from loved ones, and the suffering of not obtaining what one seeks. "Deep desires" refers to craving—this is the truth of origination, the cause of birth and death. "Heavy calamities" refers to the truth of suffering—this is the result of birth and death. Suffering is like sores, origination like warts. This clarifies the suffering of the five grasping aggregates. "Without exterior" means not departing from one's own body, existing only within the mind.

The sutra says: "Existence is originally non-existent, formed by causes and conditions; what flourishes must decline, what is real must become empty; sentient beings in ignorance all dwell as in illusions; sounds and echoes are both empty, and so too are countries and lands." The interpretation says: The third two verses clarify emptiness. The first verse [clarifies] dharma-emptiness, the latter verse person-emptiness. "Existence is originally non-existent" refers to the imagined nature. The following lines clarify the dependent nature. Since the imagined above is empty, we know the dependent [nature] is provisional and not real. The general meaning is: the imagined is permanently non-existent; the dependent seems to exist like an illusion.

The sutra says: "The consciousness-spirit is formless, provisionally riding four serpents; without eyes, one cherishes and nurtures [the body], taking it as a pleasure vehicle; form has no permanent master, spirit has no permanent home; form and spirit must separate—how could there be a country?" The interpretation says: The fourth two verses manifest the principle of impermanence. "Provisionally riding four serpents" means the basis and result are not peaceful, which is why there is suffering. The four elements mutually oppose each other; from this metaphor they are called serpents. Speaking of "without eyes" means ordinary people lack the eye of wisdom, therefore they cherish and play with this body, taking it as a pleasure vehicle. Like an eyeless elephant that only seeks food and taste. Speaking of "vehicle" metaphorically refers to the five

aggregates.

The sutra says: "At that time, when the dharma master finished explaining these verses, King Universal Brightness's retinue attained the dharma-eye of emptiness." The interpretation says: From here below, second, hearing the dharma and gaining benefit. Speaking of "dharma-eye of emptiness" refers to the wisdom of person-emptiness. Master Jing says: Seeing the dharma of the Four Noble Truths and attaining the wisdom of person-emptiness.

The sutra says: "The king himself realized and attained the samādhi equal to space, heard the dharma and awakened to understanding, then returned to King Spotted-Feet of Tianluo Kingdom." The interpretation says: Second, the king himself gained benefit. "Samādhi equal to space" refers to the contemplation of dharma-emptiness. Master Fan says: It is the samādhi of healthy action.

The sutra says: "Someone in the assembly told the 999 kings: 'The time to face death has arrived. Everyone should recite the verses from the Prajñāpāramitā Sutra of the Past Seven Buddhas' Questions to the Benevolent King.'" The interpretation says: Transmitting the teaching to the various kings.

The sutra says: "At that time King Spotted-Feet asked the various kings: 'What dharma are you all reciting?'" The interpretation says: This is King Spotted-Feet's question.

The sutra says: "At that time King Universal Brightness immediately answered the king with the above verses." The interpretation says: This is King Universal Brightness's answer.

The sutra says: "The king, hearing this dharma, attained the samādhi of emptiness. The 999 kings also, having heard it, all realized the samādhi of the three gates of emptiness." The interpretation says: The various kings gained benefit. Speaking of "samādhi of three emptinesses" refers to the samādhi of the three gates of liberation: emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness.

The sutra says: "At that time King Spotted-Feet was extremely joyful and told the various kings: 'I was misled by heretical masters. My grief for you all was excessive. You may return to your home countries and each invite dharma masters to lecture on the words and phrases of Prajñā-

pāramitā.'" The interpretation says: Commanding the release of the various kings. First great joy, next releasing them to return to their home countries, then encouraging acceptance and maintenance.

The sutra says: "At that time King Spotted-Feet entrusted his country to his younger brother, left home to follow the Way, and realized the patience of non-arising dharmas." The interpretation says: Abandoning his country and realizing the patience of non-arising dharmas.

The sutra says: "As explained in the Ten Kings' Stages, five thousand kings constantly recited this sutra and received karmic rewards in their present lives." The interpretation says: Citing explanations to establish proof. Attaining present-dharma joy.

The sutra says: "The sixteen great kings cultivate the dharma of protecting the country. The dharma should be like this—you should constantly accept and maintain it." The interpretation says: From here below, concluding by encouraging and demonstrating acceptance and maintenance.

The sutra says: "In heaven and among humans, sentient beings of the six paths should all accept and maintain the words and phrases of the seven Buddhas." The interpretation says: Encouraging sentient beings of the six paths to accept and maintain.

The sutra says: "In future ages there will again be countless small kings wanting to protect their territories. They too should invite dharma masters to explain the words and phrases of the Prajñāpāramitā Sutra." The interpretation says: Encouraging the various kings to maintain according to the dharma.

The sutra says: "At that time when Śākyamuni Buddha was explaining Prajñāpāramitā, five hundred million people in the assembly attained entry into the first stage." The interpretation says: From here below, the large third section: the assembly of that time gaining benefit. First extensive interpretation, then general conclusion. Speaking of "entering the first stage" refers to the ten faiths. Master Tong says: It is the first stage among the ten stages.

The sutra says: "Moreover, among the various princes of the six desire [realms], eight hundred thousand people attained the stage of essential emptiness." The interpretation says: This is the ten understand-

questioning Śāriputra and other five thousand people, again questioning Maitreya Lion's Roar and other ten thousand people, there was no one able to answer." The interpretation says: Second, clarifying that the assembly cannot resolve. The text has three distinct parts. First questioning the householders, next questioning the two vehicles, third questioning the bodhisattvas. "Jewel" means Ratnākara, "Canopy" means Moon Canopy, "Dharma" means Dharma Wealth, "Pure Name" is Vimalakīrti. These are all laypeople, hence called householders. Some say "Dharma" means the elder Dharma Protector. Some say "Dharma" means rules and regulations, namely the dharma of supreme understanding. "Pure" means stainless, "Name" means reputation. This means this householder broadly understands all dharmas, has no defilement stains, and his name is heard in the ten directions. Subhūti means "Empty Born" or "Good Truth," "Good Appearance," "Wealthy," etc. Śāriputra should fully be called Śāriputrāṇa. This means "Son of Śāri" or "Son of the Swan," etc. "Maitreya" means "Loving Kindness." "Lion" means determination. "Roar" means teaching. Master Fan says: Lion's Roar, in the West called Ghoṣa, this means "sound voice," also called "Lion's Roar."

The sūtra says: "At that time King Prasenajit immediately used spiritual power to create eighty thousand kinds of music, and the eighteen Brahmās and six desire realm heavens also created eighty thousand kinds of music, their sound shaking the trichiliocosm and even the ten directions' Ganges sands of Buddha lands - where there are connections, this appears." The interpretation says: Awakening the Tathāgata. First clarifying this realm, next other realms, finally jointly creating music. Three categories creating music - one can know their characteristics. "Sound shaking the trichiliocosm" etc. displays the power of the sound.

The sūtra says: "In those other Buddha countries, from the south Dharma Talent Bodhisattva together with five hundred million great assembly came and entered this great assembly, from the east Jeweled Pillar Bodhisattva together with nine hundred million great assembly came and entered this great assembly, from the north Void Nature Bodhisattva together with hundred thousand million great assembly came and entered this great assembly,

【Right page, lower section】
from the west Good Dwelling Bodhisattva together with ten Ganges sands great assembly came and entered the great assembly." The interpretation says: From here below, this clarifies other realms creating music. First gathering, then creating music. Master Fan says: Speaking of "Dharma Talent" means meritorious dharmas - both self-benefit and benefiting others have skillful talent. Speaking of "Jeweled Pillar" means realized virtue - essentially transcending birth and death, hence called "Jeweled Pillar." Speaking of "Void Nature" means constantly dwelling in space, also using space as treasury, producing precious treasures. Speaking of "Good Dwelling" means skillfully realizing and entering the self-nature of the path of cessation, hence called "Good Dwelling." However, in this sūtra, the sequence of four directions differs from other sūtras because the number of retinues and the order of their approach forms the sequential explanation. As in the sūtra, this can be understood.

The sūtra says: "The six directions are also thus." The interpretation says: Second, categorically explaining the six directions.

The sūtra says: "Creating music is also thus." The interpretation says: Categorically explaining creating music.

The sūtra says: "Also together creating immeasurable music to awaken the Tathāgata." The interpretation says: Third, jointly creating music.

The sūtra says: "The Buddha immediately knowing the time, obtaining sentient beings' faculties, immediately arose from samādhi onto the square lotus lion throne like Diamond Mountain King." The interpretation says: Fourth, the Buddha ascending the flower throne. Speaking of "obtaining faculties" means obtaining knowledge that faculties are ripened. Speaking of "diamond" means not moved by the eight winds, not moved by the deviant. Gain, loss, defamation, praise, acclaim, ridicule, suffering, pleasure - these are called the eight winds.

The sūtra says: "The great assembly rejoiced, each manifesting immeasurable supernatural powers, dwelling as a great assembly on earth and in space." The interpretation says: Fifth, joyfully manifesting spiritual powers. Depending on earth and space for support. Other realms depend on space, this realm

depends on earth. Real assemblies depend on earth, transformed assemblies depend on space. Holy assemblies depend on space, ordinary assemblies depend on earth.

Contemplating Emptiness Chapter Two (Contemplating Emptiness Chapter excerpt. The Eiroku 9 manuscript lacks this, so it's supplemented with the Kan'en 4 Jōkei manuscript)
From here below clarifying the proper teaching section. To explain this chapter, there are two meanings: first explaining the chapter name, second properly explaining the text. Speaking of "contemplating emptiness": traditionally various explanations differ. Non-discriminating wisdom internally realizes the two emptinesses of person and phenomena, able to remove the two obstructions, hence called the Contemplating Emptiness Chapter. Master Cien says: Generally discussing emptiness, there are briefly four types: first, unconditioned emptiness; second, particular emptiness of no-self, meaning on contaminated five aggregates there is no self or self-possession, thus explaining the five aggregates as empty; third, universal emptiness of no-self, like the World-Honored One's teaching that all dharmas are empty, empty of self-essence, pervading all dharmas; fourth, suchness revealed by the two emptinesses of person and phenomena, explaining this as emptiness. This nature of emptiness, hence explained and named as emptiness. If following Sanskrit sounds, emptiness has two meanings: first śūnya, translated as empty, the first of four, able to manifest the meaning of non-existence; second śūnyatā, called "emptiness nature," namely the fourth's revealed true nature. Now here, at the śūnyatā place, explaining the śūnya sound - not knowing the old explanation. Emptiness is principle, contemplation means observation, namely the wisdom that can observe. Emptiness means emptiness nature, this is the observed realm. Non-discriminating wisdom contemplates empty suchness. Combining realm and wisdom in explanation, called Contemplating Emptiness Chapter.

The sūtra says: "At that time the Buddha told the great assembly, knowing the sixteen great kings' intention to question about the causes and conditions of protecting the country." The interpretation says: Second, properly explaining according to the text. The five chapters below clarify the proper teaching section. Generally divided into three: initially

【Left page, lower section】
having three chapters properly clarifying inner protection, next the Protecting the Country chapter distinguishing outer protection, finally the Scattering Flowers chapter bearing gratitude through offerings. Or possibly, the Upholding chapter is also considered orthodox teaching, bearing gratitude by scattering flowers and upholding. Though there are two explanations, for now following the former interpretation. Within inner protection, again divided into two: first briefly opening the two protections, later extensive explanation through questions and answers. This is the beginning.

The sūtra says: "Now I will first explain for the bodhisattvas the causes and conditions of protecting Buddha fruit and the causes and conditions of protecting the practices of the ten stages." The interpretation says: Later briefly opening the two protections - namely Buddha fruit and ten stages. Buddha fruit as what is protected, ten stages as what protects. Also ten stages as what is protected, pre-stage prajñā as what protects. The various stages successively generate the later ones. The king requests protecting the country, the Buddha explains two protections because one who wishes to protect national power must depend on these two protections, hence there's no contradiction.

The sūtra says: "Listen carefully, listen carefully, think well of this, practice according to Dharma." The interpretation says: Encouraging the three wisdoms. Speaking of "listen carefully" generates hearing wisdom. "Think well of this" generates contemplative wisdom. "Practice according to Dharma" reveals cultivation wisdom - wisdom arising from cultivating meditation.

The sūtra says: "At that time King Prasenajit said 'Excellent! For the sake of great causes and conditions,' immediately scattered hundred billion kinds of colored flowers, transforming into hundred billion jeweled canopies covering the great assembly." The interpretation says: Fourth, joyful offering. Speaking of "great matter," the Wisdom Treatise says: When Buddha teaches prajñā, countless sentient beings will continue the Buddha lineage. Speaking of "immediately scattering hundred billion various colored flowers" represents the protective practices achieving completion and drawing excellent fruits. Speaking of "transforming into hundred billion jeweled canopies covering the great assembly" represents the protected fruits being fulfilled and sheltering all beings. Master Zang says: Speaking of "excellent" means describing

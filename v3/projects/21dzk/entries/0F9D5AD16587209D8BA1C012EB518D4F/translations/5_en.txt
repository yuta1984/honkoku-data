Because they have destroyed the thieves of afflictions. Because they should receive wonderful offerings from the world. Because they will never again receive segmented birth. Question: The fourth fruit possesses the three meanings, so it can be called arhat. The others lack the three meanings—how can it be said that all are arhats? Answer: According to the *Fundamental Record*, śrāvakas who pursue cessation do not receive teachings, therefore they are called "beyond learning" (aśaikṣa). Śrāvakas who dedicate [merit] pursue bodhi, therefore they are called "in learning" (śaikṣa). Also, arhat has four meanings: first, leaving the ordinary; second, killing thieves; third, worthy of offerings; fourth, breaking causation. Generally speaking, all four fruits have the four meanings. Therefore it says "all are arhats." Some say: because of faculty transformation and so forth, they are called "in learning"; because there is no fruit to seek, they are called "beyond learning." Now interpreting "arhat," there are naturally two types: first, practicing arhat, which refers to learners; second, dwelling arhat, which is only the fourth fruit. Therefore the *Satyasiddhi-śāstra* says: "There are two types of arhat: dwelling and practicing." Also, the sutra below says: "Five-precept sages, practicing arhats." Or perhaps because they partially possess the meaning of being worthy of offerings and so forth, they are called arhats. Master Tongshuai says: "The three fruits of learners have not ceased their progressive seeking. Arhats who are beyond learning have ceased seeking in principle." According to the Tripiṭaka master's explanation: "Entering the great śrāvaka is called 'in learning'; dwelling in the lesser śrāvaka is called 'beyond learning.'" Arhat means "no-birth." This refers to the general designation—the sages of the four fruits are called arhats because they generally possess the meaning of no-birth and non-attachment, not because they dwell in the fourth [fruit]. The Tripiṭaka master says: "Arhat has three meanings: first, arhat means 'worthy of offerings'; second, arahā means 'no-birth'; third, arūkha means 'thief-killer.' The people of the lower three fruits also partially possess the three meanings." The *Mahāsaṃnipāta-sūtra* says: "Great Dharma bodhisattvas are called arhats." The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra* says: "Whether the knowledge or cessation of śrāvakas, all are the bodhisattvas' patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas."

The sutra says "conditioned merits, unconditioned merits." The interpretation says: From here onward is the third—separately manifesting merits. This is divided into eight: first, conditioned and unconditioned virtues; second, the ten knowledges' distinctive virtues; third, the three faculties' distinctive virtues; fourth, sixteen observation gates; fifth, three provisional observation gates; sixth, three emptiness observation gates; seventh, four truths observation gates; eighth, dependent origination observation gates. This is the first—the conditioned and unconditioned gate. The virtues of the ten knowledges and so forth are all subject to transition by the four characteristics of the conditioned, having the four or five aggregates as their nature. Unconditioned merits have the unconditioned of the cessation truth, suchness, analytical cessation, and non-analytical cessation as their nature.

The sutra says "ten knowledges for the beyond learning, eight knowledges for the in learning, six knowledges for the in learning." The interpretation says: Second is the ten knowledges discrimination gate. The ten knowledges are: conventional knowledge, dharma knowledge, subsequent knowledge, suffering knowledge, origination knowledge, cessation knowledge, path knowledge, knowledge of others' minds, exhaustion knowledge, and non-arising knowledge. In the beyond-learning path, one possesses the ten knowledges. In the cultivation stage of learning, exhaustion and non-arising are excluded. In the seeing stage of learning, knowledge of others' minds, conventional knowledge, and exhaustion and non-arising knowledges are excluded. Exhaustion and non-arising knowledges are excluded because they exist in the beyond-learning. Knowledge of others' minds is excluded because fundamental concentration has not yet been attained. Conventional knowledge is excluded because it existed previously and is not newly attained. It is not the bond-severing knowledge of stream-enterers. In the seeing path stage, there are only six knowledges. All are discussed in terms of manifest activity, not complete attainment. Master Paramārtha says: "The ten knowledges are: first, able to receive; second, able to select; third, able to gather; fourth, characteristic opening; fifth, increase; sixth, determination; seventh, purity; eighth, effortless; ninth, penetration; tenth, antidote. Down to the six knowledges—this differs from the usual explanation."

The sutra says "three faculties." The interpretation says: Third is the three faculties discrimination gate. According to the *Fundamental Record*: "First is the inherent nature faculty,

【Left page, upper section】
namely ordinary beings. Second is the drawing faculty, from the ten faiths to the ten grounds. Third is the fruit-attaining faculty, namely the Tathāgata." The present interpretation is not so. First is the faculty of coming to know the unknown; second is the faculty of already knowing; third is the faculty of perfect knowing. They exist in the seeing, cultivation, and beyond-learning stages, as can be commonly understood.

The sutra says "sixteen mental activities." The interpretation says: Fourth is the sixteen observation discrimination gate. According to the *Fundamental Record*: "The thirty minds before the grounds are combined into four minds, the ten holy grounds become ten, and the vajra and Buddha stages each become one, called the sixteen minds." The present interpretation is not so. Namely, in relation to the four truths, one generates the activities of sixteen minds, therefore called "mental activities"—mind is not identical to activity. The four knowledges of the suffering truth are: patience with dharma knowledge of suffering, dharma knowledge of suffering, patience with subsequent knowledge of suffering, subsequent knowledge of suffering. The four knowledges of the origination truth are: patience with dharma knowledge of origination, dharma knowledge of origination, patience with subsequent knowledge of origination, subsequent knowledge of origination. The four knowledges of the cessation truth are: patience with dharma knowledge of cessation, dharma knowledge of cessation, patience with subsequent knowledge of cessation, subsequent knowledge of cessation. The four knowledges of the path truth are: patience with dharma knowledge of the path, dharma knowledge of the path, patience with subsequent knowledge of the path, subsequent knowledge of the path. Because knowledge necessarily corresponds with mind together, knowledge is hidden and mind is manifested, called the sixteen minds. These are precisely the minds corresponding to the uncontaminated knowledge arising in the seeing path.

The sutra says "dharma-provisional true-false observation, reception-provisional true-false observation, name-provisional true-false observation." The interpretation says: Fifth is the three provisional observation gates. First is dharma-provisional: what constitutes the five aggregates arises from conditions. Second is reception-provisional: the continuity-provisional that the aggregates constitute receives the five aggregates. Third is name-provisional: those two names lack real substance. Eliminating the three false provisionals and observing the principle of true characteristics is called "true-false observation."

The sutra says "three emptiness observation gates." The interpretation says: Sixth is the three emptiness observation gates. First is the emptiness gate; second is the signless

【Left page, lower section】
gate; third is the wishless gate.

The sutra says "four truths and twelve-fold dependent origination." The interpretation says: Seventh is the four truths observation gate; eighth is the dependent origination observation gate. These can be understood as usual.

The sutra says "immeasurable merits are all perfected." The interpretation says: Fourth is generally concluding the virtues.

The sutra says "There were also eight hundred myriad koṭis of great sage pratyekabuddhas." The interpretation says: This clarifies the pratyekabuddha assembly. Within this there are three parts: first, indicating numbers and clarifying types; next, praising virtues; finally, general conclusion. "Eight hundred myriad" raises the number. Saying "great sage pratyekabuddhas" manifests the type. Some places say: "Because they naturally achieve clear awakening, they are called great sages." The present interpretation: constantly enjoying tranquility, like those dwelling as sages, therefore called great sages. However, those sages have three types: first, buddhas; second, pratyekabuddhas; third, [those with] five supernatural powers. As in the *Mahāvibhāṣā*, fascicle 183. Now, in contrast to the five supernatural powers, they are called great sages. Question: Are there pratyekabuddhas in the Buddha's assembly? If we say there are, how do we reconcile this with what the *Mahāvyūha-sūtra* says? Its first [fascicle] says: "When a one-life-remaining bodhisattva was about to descend and be born, there was a deva who descended to Jambudvīpa and told the pratyekabuddhas: 'Worthy ones should abandon this mastery. Why? Because after twelve years, there will be a bodhisattva who will descend spiritually and enter the womb.' At that time, five hundred pratyekabuddhas, having heard the deva's words, arose from their seats, leaped into empty space to the height of seven tāla trees, manifested fire to burn their bodies, and entered nirvāṇa." If we say there are none, how should we understand what this sutra explains? Answer: The various explanations differ. One says: "In the esoteric there are indeed [pratyekabuddhas], in the manifest there are none." Therefore the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "Buddha-dharma has two types: first, esoteric; second, manifest. At the first turning of the dharma wheel, there were people of the three vehicles who each attained the noble fruits. This is the esoteric assembly. This present sutra

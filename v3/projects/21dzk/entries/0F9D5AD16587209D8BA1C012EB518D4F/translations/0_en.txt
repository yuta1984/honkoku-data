Buddha's Discourse on the Sutra for Humane Kings Who Wish to Protect Their States through Perfection of Wisdom, Introductory Chapter, First

In preparing to explain this sutra, I shall distinguish four aspects: First, the intention of expounding the sutra and interpretation of the title; Second, distinguishing the main doctrine being explained and the doctrinal essence that explains it; Third, clarifying what the teaching depends upon and the sentient beings it is intended for; Fourth, the period of translation and proper explanation according to the text. Regarding the intention of expounding the sutra and its title: I have heard that the true nature is condensed and tranquil, transcending names and forms in its serenity. The wondrous Way is mysteriously profound, severing mind and speech in its profundity. Nevertheless, all conscious beings sink together in the five defilements, and the masses perish at the bottom of the six realms. They have long been lost in the forest of the unconditioned, constantly traversing the marshes of the conditioned. Therefore, one can raise the sun of wisdom in the deep darkness, where sixteen cranes place their hopes, and float the ship of teaching on the sea of suffering, where five hundred markets rush about. How vast is this authority of salvation! How boundless is this art of guidance! This present sutra is precisely the bright jewel that removes suffering and bestows joy, the divine talisman that averts calamities and brings peace to the realm. The mirror of wisdom illuminates all ten stages of sainthood, and the wind of eloquence resounds powerfully through the five stages of patience. Therefore it is named "Buddha's Discourse." It bestows compassion and profound love, penetrating the three to attain the one, hence it is called "Humane King." When a hundred divisions display their might, the mists of heavenly disasters roll away. Through universal bright commands, joy fills the body. When five thousand exert their power, the frost of earthly demons melts away, the spotted-foot demon reforms his mind, and grasses bow in timely response. Therefore it is called "Protecting the State." "Prajña-paramita" refers to the wondrous Dharma that can protect, the general name for this entire work. This is translated as "wisdom reaching the other shore." This is precisely the lofty purport of the letter 'i' and the wondrous strategy of the ocean eye. Internally it generates ten thousand virtues, culminating in the elimination of traces; externally it dispels the seven difficulties, repelling the disasters of Śakra. "Sutra" means permanent; "Introductory" means origin; "Chapter" means category; "First" means rank; "One" means beginning. Therefore it is said.

Second, distinguishing the main doctrine being explained and the doctrinal essence that explains it: This has two aspects. First distinguish the doctrinal essence, then clarify the main teaching. Regarding the exposition of doctrinal essence, the various schools do not agree. The different theories of the Lesser Vehicle are as commonly explained. According to the various teachings of the Greater Vehicle, they are not uniform. In some cases, only sound is considered the doctrinal essence, as stated in the Vimalakirti Sutra and others: "The Buddha expounds the Dharma with one sound, and sentient beings each gain understanding according to their type." The Daikai Sutra also says: "In the Tathagata's single word of Dharma exposition, countless sutras are expounded." In some cases, only names and such are used as the essence, as the Vijñaptimātratā-siddhi states: "If names, sentences, and syllables are not different from sounds, there should be no distinction in the realm of unobstructed knowledge of phenomena and words." In some cases, sounds and names are combined to form the essence, as the Vimalakīrti Sutra states: "Sometimes one performs Buddha-work through sounds, speech, and written texts." In some cases, what explains and what is explained are combined as the essence, as Yogācāra-bhūmi 81 states: "The essence of sutras has briefly two types: first, text; second, meaning. Text is what is depended upon; meaning is what depends. These two types are collectively called the realm of all knowable objects." The Prakaraṇa-aryavāca-śāstra agrees. The reason these various teachings differ, according to the Tripitaka Master's explanation: "In reality, all use names-sentences-syllables, sounds, and text-meaning combined as the essence. However, the various sacred teachings each depend on one aspect, so they do not contradict each other. Why is this so? Making the conventional follow the real, sound is used as essence because apart from sound there are no separate names, sentences, etc. Making essence follow function, names and such are the essence because they can explain the inherent nature and distinctions of all phenomena, being the support for both. Conventional and real support each other, combined as essence, because if any one type is lacking, the explanation cannot be established. The ultimate generation of understanding must depend on text and meaning. Therefore the various explanations do not contradict each other." According to this sutra text, there are only two aspects: First, the aspect of numerical phenomena, using

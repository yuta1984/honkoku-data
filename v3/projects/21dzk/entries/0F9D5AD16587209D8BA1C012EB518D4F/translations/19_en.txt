The sutra says: "Also lecture and recite this sutra. The dharma methods are as explained above." The interpretation says: This is an interpretation by analogy.

The sutra says: "Great King, in ancient days there was a king. Śakra came for King Topknot-Born, ascending to heaven, wanting to destroy his country." The interpretation says: From here below, second, citing ancient [examples] as precedent for today. The Wise and Foolish Sutra says: In past lives, there was a great king named Good Dwelling. At that time, on the king's head, a sac suddenly grew. Its form was like a cocoon, pure and clear, and caused no pain or illness. Later it gradually grew larger and became a child, extremely handsome. His hair was dark blue, his body purple-gold colored. [The king] immediately summoned physiognomists, who divined that he possessed virtue and would surely become a sage king, ruling the four domains. Therefore they established the name Topknot-Born. As years passed he grew up, and his virtue became manifest. When the father king died, the various king-ministers wished him to succeed to the throne. Topknot-Born replied: "If I have merit and should become king, then let the Four Kings and Śakra come to welcome and invest me. Only then will I ascend the throne." After establishing this vow, the Four Heavenly Kings descended, each bestowing a jeweled vase filled with fragrant water to anoint his head. At that time Śakra also held a jeweled crown and came to crown him. In Jambudvīpa he indulged in the five desires for 84,000 years. Then yakṣa spirits emerged from the earth and requested travel to the Eastern Continent. After 800 million years, they again requested the Western Continent. After 1.4 billion years, the Northern Continent for 1.8 billion years. In the Heaven of the Four Kings for 1.4 billion years. In his mind he again thought to ascend to Trāyastriṃśa Heaven. Five hundred sages supported his chariot and flew together to heaven. From afar they saw the royal city. The city had 1,200 gates. The various devas, in fear, closed all the gates and applied double locks. Topknot-Born's army proceeded directly without obstruction. They blew conches and

shot arrows. The 1,200 gates all opened simultaneously. Śakra immediately came out to meet them. He invited [Topknot-Born] into the palace and they shared the throne. Receiving desires in heaven, Topknot-Born later emerged, blowing conches and drawing bows. Evil mind having arisen, he consequently fell. Later encountering evil illness, he immediately died. Now according to this sutra: Heavenly King Śakra, following the dharma of the seven Buddhas, spread out one hundred high seats, invited one hundred dharma masters, and lectured on this sutra. At that time King Topknot-Born consequently fell immediately. The Śakra of that time was Kāśyapa Buddha. Speaking of Topknot-Born, that is my present body.

The sutra says: "At that time Heavenly King Śakra, following the dharma methods of the seven Buddhas, spread out one hundred high seats, invited one hundred dharma masters to lecture on Prajñāpāramitā, and Topknot-Born immediately retreated." The interpretation says: According to the sutra, protecting the dharma. Speaking of "Śakradevānām Indra" means "Able Heavenly Emperor."

The sutra says: "As explained in the Sin-Extinguishing Sutra." The interpretation says: This indicates where it is explained. This sutra has not yet been translated. Master Tong says: This sutra should refer to the Nirvāṇa Sutra text, because it extensively explains King Ajātaśatru's sin-extinguishing affairs.

The sutra says: "Great King, formerly there was a king of Tianluo Kingdom who had a crown prince wanting to ascend the throne, named Prince Spotted-Feet. He received teaching from the heretical master Rādhā that he should take the heads of a thousand kings to sacrifice to the tomb spirit and ascend to that position himself. He obtained 999 kings, lacking one king. He immediately traveled north ten thousand li and obtained one king named King Universal Brightness. This King Universal Brightness addressed King Spotted-Feet saying: 'Please allow me one day to offer food to śramaṇas and bow to the Three Jewels.'" The interpretation says: Citing King Universal Brightness to prove the above protection of the body. Master Fan says: Speaking of "Tianluo" means "Heaven-Descended." Speaking of "Rādhā" means "Fighting-Disorder." Regarding Spotted-Feet, the Wise and Foolish Sutra says: Formerly King Pārada

led four kinds of troops into the mountains to hunt. He encountered a female lion. The king immediately mated with her. The lioness conceived, and when the time was fulfilled, gave birth to a male child. His entire body resembled a human, but his spotted feet resembled his mother. The lioness carried her cub back to the king's place. The king took him as his son and named him Spotted-Feet. This king always supported one sage, constantly offering pure food. One day the sage did not come to the king. A heavenly spirit transformed into the sage's form, entered the royal palace, and requested fish and meat food. The old sage came again the next day as usual. The king offered meat food. The sage became angry and wondered why this test was being made. "Now the king should, for the next twelve years, constantly eat human flesh." Having finished speaking, the sage returned to the mountains. After this, the kitchen supervisor could not manage. Going outside in order, he saw no meat but saw a dead small child. He quickly took its flesh, made food and offered it to the king. The king found it very delicious and immediately asked about its origin. The kitchen servant answered truthfully. The king said: "From now on, use this meat." The kitchen servant constantly captured small children, killing them for food, daily supplying the king. The people of the country lost their children and searched everywhere greedily. They saw the kitchen servant capturing others' small children and bound the kitchen servant. The people reported to the king. The king said it was his instruction. The people all said: "The king is a great thief." Watching for when the king bathed in the pool, they ambushed soldiers and attacked the king. The king, having been attacked, immediately told the people: "Please grant me one pardon. I will never kill again." The people would not permit this. The king immediately made a vow: "May all the good deeds I have cultivated up to now be turned around so that today I become a rākṣasa, traveling invisibly to eat people." Having spoken, he immediately hid in the sky, crying out: "From now on, I shall eat the wives and children you love." People heard and fled quickly. Many rākṣasas attached themselves and followed along. The followers gradually increased, and the harm spread ever wider. Later the various rākṣasas said: "I serve as king,

following the king's orders now. You should, for our group, take a thousand kings in total to make one great feast." Spotted-Feet said "Good." Going one by one to take them, he had already obtained 999 kings, lacking only one king. Unable to make the feast, the various kings each said: "We have no hope of returning home all day. We should capture King Sudāsa. He has great skillful means and can save our lives." Having made this plan, they addressed Spotted-Feet saying: "The king wishes to make a feast. King Sudāsa has high reputation and virtue. If you obtain him, the king's gathering will be complete." At that time the rākṣasa king immediately rushed to take him. At that time King Sudāsa left the city heading for the garden, entering a pool wanting to bathe. He saw a beggar following the king. The king said: "Wait a moment. After washing I will give alms." The king had just entered the pool when the rākṣasa king descended invisibly from the sky and seized King Sudāsa. The king wept sorrowfully. King Spotted-Feet said: "I have heard your reputation and virtue are foremost. Why does a great man cry and wail?" King Sudāsa said: "I do not love my body and life. This morning upon leaving I saw a person begging and promised to give alms. Meeting with the king bringing me here, I could not fulfill this. This is why I grieve. Please, king, release me for seven days to make offerings to religious practitioners." Spotted-Feet immediately agreed. The king returned for seven days and made offerings to religious practitioners. At that time a brahmin explained verses for the king. The verses were the same as in this sutra. The king, hearing them, rejoiced and immediately established the crown prince to replace him as king. Taking leave, he went to his death. King Spotted-Feet said: "You are now going to death, why are you joyful?" Sudāsa replied: "The great king's kindness is vast. You released me for seven days to make offerings to religious practitioners. Hearing the subtle and wonderful dharma, my mind naturally opened and understood. My vow is now fulfilled." Spotted-Feet asked: "What dharma did you hear?" Sudāsa immediately proclaimed the wonderful dharma for him, and also further explained the karmic retribution of killing. After hearing this, Spotted-Feet immediately released Sudāsa and all the kings, who each returned to their home countries. The King Sudāsa of that time is my body. King Spotted-Feet is Aṅgulimāla.

oxen." This is the great white ox-cart. What was promised within the house only said "ox-cart" and did not say "white ox." Therefore the verse text says "goat-cart, deer-cart, and great ox cart." If the ox-cart among the three carts were white oxen, it should say "goat-cart, deer-cart, and great white ox-cart." Why is there no "white" character, yet there is a "zhi" (之) character? Since it says "great ox cart," clearly there are also separate great white ox-carts." How is this refuted?

Answer: According to the oral transmission of the late Dharma Master Zhongshan of Master Xue: "This reasoning has merit. However, one should counter-argue: In the Peaceful Practices chapter, in the bright jewel analogy, the prose says 'Like a mighty wheel-turning sage king who wishes to use his威势 to subdue various countries,' etc. In the verse it says 'Like a mighty wheel-turning king.' This is the same as the prose. The 'wheel-turning sage king' in the prose is called 'wheel-turning king' in the verse, without the character 'sage' but with the character 'zhi.' If because there is no 'sage' character but there is a 'zhi' character, can there also be wheel-turning sage kings beyond wheel-turning kings? This is clearly not so. How then is that case different?" This principle should be kept secret and not transmitted carelessly.

Question: The chapter states: "Also, how do Mahāyāna and One Vehicle differ in understanding and practice? Yet you say 'abandon the three and proceed to the one.' Removing the doubts of newly aspiring bodhisattvas means: among the ten meanings, sustaining the others without yet explaining the One Vehicle, fearing they might become discouraged in their diligence and arise doubts leading to retreat, making them hear the One Vehicle to remove their doubts. This is abandoning lower positions to proceed to higher stages, not abandoning Mahāyāna to enter the one. Otherwise, the ten bhūmis abandoning lower to proceed to higher should all also be called 'breaking the three to return to the one.' Also, it should say 'the other three are not true.' Why does it only say 'two'?" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the eighth part of the previous answer, clarifying that if the three were broken, there would be the error of Mahāyāna and One Vehicle being different. Pearl states: "Master Xuanlong says: 'The Tripiṭaka master explains: Mahāyāna and One Vehicle have different names but the same meaning. Saying "Mahāyāna" is a name in contrast to the lesser. Saying "One Vehicle" is a name in contrast to causes.' I also agree with this." The passage "Otherwise, the ten bhūmis abandoning lower to proceed to higher should all also be called 'breaking the three to return to the one'" is the same as the passage in the above "Breaking the Separate" section: "Even if this were granted, it would also break, leading to infinite regress."

Question: The Tiantai school establishes four teachings, saying "Mahāyāna and One Vehicle are separate." Why do you say "how are they different" to such people? Answer: Saying "how are they different" now breaks their doctrine and makes them trust and understand that Mahāyāna and One Vehicle have different names but the same meaning.

Question: The chapter states: "Śrīmālā also says: 'If the Tathāgata follows their inclinations and speaks expediently, this is Mahāyāna. Since there are no two vehicles.' Harmonizing the two vehicles to enter the one is expedient explanation, not true principle. Though the sutra speaks of 'opening expedient gates to reveal true characteristics,' saying there are indeterminate-nature two vehicles is an expedient gate. Because it distantly makes them enter truth. Now explaining the One Vehicle makes them proceed to the ultimate fruit, which is called true reality. It does not mean there are no two and only one is called true." What does this mean?

Answer: This is the ninth part of the previous answer, depending on the Śrīmālā Sutra to clarify the reason for explaining the One Vehicle to break the two vehicles. Saying "though the sutra speaks, etc." harmonizes the apparent contradiction between Śrīmālā and Lotus, ultimately returning to Śrīmālā. Good Pearl states: "Citing Śrīmālā has two meanings: First, since it only says 'there are no two vehicles' and doesn't say 'three vehicles,' we know it doesn't harmonize Mahāyāna. Second, since it says 'expedient explanation' and doesn't say 'true reality,' it harmonizes the indeterminate-nature but not the determinate-nature." Also explaining the Lotus: "'This is an expedient gate, distantly making them enter truth' encompasses the meaning of distant and indirect. That is, formerly explaining two vehicle fruits, etc., making them proceed to ultimate fruit, called true reality, encompasses the meaning of near and direct." Near and direct refers to Mahāyāna fruits, etc.

Question: The chapter states: "Therefore the Lotus says: 'Secretly sent two people, blind and short and ugly.' It doesn't say 'three people.' Also it says: 'For the sake of a resting place, explained the two.' It doesn't say 'three.' Therefore." What does this mean?

Answer: This is the tenth part of the previous answer, depending on this sutra to clarify the reason for not breaking the great. Xuanzan states: "Actually there are no two essences. Even if there are teachings of two vehicles, therefore it says 'secretly sent.' Expedient teachings only transform two vehicles, therefore it says 'two people.'" It also says: "'Blind' means not seeing correctly. For the two vehicles, established truth teachings are explained. The verbal expressions revealing meaning are not complete, called 'blind.' The principles they explain are short in emptiness of persons, hence called 'short.' Without dharma-body merit and virtues, ugly, hence called 'ugly.'" The meanings of resting place, etc., are as previously recorded.

Question: The chapter states: "If you say 'those who enter great positions through indirect approach are called Mahāyāna, and if direct-path practitioners, their entered great positions are called One Vehicle,' then the One Vehicle in sutras and treatises is truly for the indeterminate. This present explanation lacks canonical basis and explicit texts. The Lotus One Vehicle is based on direct approach. What difference is there between these two practice-positions now? Therefore know: through expedients, hiding that there are no two vehicles, the One Vehicle is explained to transform those in the assembly who should hear it." What does this mean?

Answer: This is the eleventh part of the previous answer, breaking counter-rescues.

Question: What do this counter-rescue and refutation mean? Answer: The counter-rescue means: "The previous objection said: 'If you say Mahāyāna and One Vehicle are separate, wouldn't this be harmonizing sudden enlightenment to make it enter gradual enlightenment?' They rescue this by saying: 'Those who indirectly approach enter the great, called Mahāyāna. What direct-path practitioners enter is called One Vehicle. Therefore Mahāyāna and One Vehicle are still different.'" Now refuting this:

[Lower Section]

"If so, the One Vehicle explained in sutras and treatises is truly for the indeterminate. There are no explicit texts where teachings received by gradual-enlightenment people with changed minds are called Mahāyāna, and teachings received by sudden-enlightenment people are called One Vehicle. What canonical basis is there? The Lotus One Vehicle is explained for indeterminate-nature two vehicles. This is clearly explained in sutras and treatises. How can you say it's only explained for direct-path practitioners? Also, what difference is there between the practices cultivated and positions entered by indirect-approach people who turn from small to enter great, and the practices cultivated and positions entered by direct-path people? Calling that 'Mahāyāna' and this 'One Vehicle.' Therefore know: only through expedients hiding that there are no two vehicles, secretly explaining the One Vehicle to transform the appropriate recipients in the assembly."

Question: If so, why say "Mahāyāna is a name in contrast to the lesser; One Vehicle is a name in contrast to causes"? Isn't this the same as the counter-rescue's meaning? Answer: This objection is incorrect. Regarding one essential dharma, names are obtained according to meanings, therefore we say so. The counter-rescue's meaning is different: gradual enlightenment entering the great is called Mahāyāna; what sudden enlightenment enters is called One Vehicle; their essences are separate. Therefore two-vehicle people turning from small to enter great are called Mahāyāna. Furthermore, harmonizing that gradual-enlightenment Mahāyāna to enter sudden-enlightenment One Vehicle positions is called "harmonizing three to return to one." Therefore the chapter master refutes this. The refutation's meaning is as above.

Question: The chapter states: "Some say: 'Even after the Buddha completed three kalpas, he was still an ordinary person. In thirty-four moments he achieved the bodhi position.' Now explaining the One Vehicle to break this attachment is also not breaking the three. This is merely the distorted view of Lesser Vehicle after the Buddha's extinction. How could there be those in the Buddha's lifetime who held this attachment, with the Buddha taking it as true and now explaining to break it? Therefore only break the two." What does this mean?

Answer: This is the twelfth part of the previous answer, breaking certain explanations. Good Pearl states: "This breaks those who depend on

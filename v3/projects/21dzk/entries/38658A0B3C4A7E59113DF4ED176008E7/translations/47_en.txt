Answer: These two causes are explained later in that treatise, and their meaning is quite different. Therefore, the next passage of the treatise states: "Question: If so, what other meaning is there in explaining the One Vehicle with those intentions?" To answer this question, there is this subsequent verse. The long prose commentary states: "Those intentions have two meanings: first, to attract and gather all śrāvakas; second, to maintain and support all bodhisattvas. If śrāvakas are undetermined in nature regarding their own vehicle, Buddha explains the One Vehicle to attract and gather such people and lead them into the Mahāyāna. If bodhisattvas are undetermined in nature regarding their own vehicle, Buddha explains the One Vehicle to maintain and support such people so they do not retreat from the Mahāyāna." Therefore, we know that the One Vehicle is explained with the previous eight meanings for these two types of people.

Question: Why is this so? Answer: The previous eight meanings correctly reveal the causes for explaining the One Vehicle, while the latter two meanings reveal the intended recipients of that One Vehicle teaching. Explaining the One Vehicle with eight causes is for these two types of people. Therefore, it is so.

Question: If so, shouldn't the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha also be the same? Why does it have ten causes? Answer: The two treatises have different intentions. The intention of the Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṃkāra is as previously stated. In the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha's intention, the eight causes such as dharma-selflessness are not only for these two types of undetermined people, but also for explaining the One Vehicle to those of determined nature in the three vehicles and to emanated beings. Therefore, combining persons and dharmas, it speaks of having ten causes. If not, wouldn't the third, fourth, fifth, and seventh causes apply to those of determined nature in the two vehicles? The minor portion of the eighth cause, the cause of bodhisattvas of the same name—how could this apply to undetermined people? Does the ninth cause of "transformation" also apply to the undetermined? There are such confusions. Therefore, persons and dharmas are combined to make ten causes. The intention of the Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṃkāra is not like that of the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha. It is also said that the treatises have different intentions and cannot be harmonized.

Question: What is the meaning of the fourth gate of manifesting differences? Answer: The meaning of this gate is to clarify the differences in the One Vehicle as explained in various sutras.

Question: How are they differentiated? Answer: This sutra is contrasted with the Śrīmālā and Nirvāṇa sutras to clarify their differences. There are six levels in total, which is why it is said so.

Question: The chapter states: "This explanation of the One Vehicle has different characteristics from the One Vehicle explained in the Śrīmālā and Nirvāṇa sutras. This [Lotus] encompasses both principle and wisdom, while those [others] are only Buddha-nature." What does this mean? Answer: This clarifies that there are six levels of contrast between this sutra and the One Vehicle explained in the Śrīmālā and Nirvāṇa sutras. This passage first generally clarifies the characteristics of their differences and also reveals the first contrast of principle and wisdom. The meaning is: when this Lotus One Vehicle is contrasted with the One Vehicle of the Śrīmālā and Nirvāṇa sutras to clarify their differences, this sutra's One Vehicle encompasses both principle and wisdom, while those sutras' One Vehicle is only the principle of nature. The Chapter on Various Vehicles states: "The Lotus clearly takes wisdom as the One Vehicle and speaks of true principle in a hidden way. Although it explains that the phantom city is also not true extinction and speaks of great nirvāṇa merely for the treasure destination, it does not yet clearly explain true nirvāṇa. Since the nirvāṇa attained by those of the two vehicles is collectively called 'transformed,' and bodhi is not attained at all, it clearly takes wisdom as the One Vehicle to make them aspire and seek it. The Śrīmālā takes true principle as the One Vehicle and does not speak of wisdom. Therefore, both inclusion and generation are complete." With this passage, one can understand the meaning of "this encompasses principle and wisdom, while that is only Buddha-nature."

Question: "This" refers to the Lotus, and "that" refers to the Śrīmālā and Nirvāṇa. Among those two sutras, is it a one-by-one contrast or a mutual contrast? Answer: The Water Commentary states: "In distinguishing the three root sutras, the Lotus is taken to generally contrast with both the Śrīmālā and Nirvāṇa for discussion. It is not that the other two sutras are distinguished in one-by-one contrast."

Question: The answer is so. What text shows that this sutra encompasses principle and wisdom?

What text shows that those sutras are only Buddha-nature? Answer: The texts of these sutras are very numerous. Let me just cite one or two examples. In this sutra, "opening, revealing, awakening, and entering" constitute the One Vehicle. "Opening" encompasses both principle and wisdom, "revealing" is only principle, "awakening" is only wisdom, and "entering" has two causes. The ox-cart is wisdom, and the treasure destination is principle. When the Śrīmālā Sutra explains principle, it means "the One Vehicle is namely the Mahāyāna, and the Mahāyāna is namely the nirvāṇa-realm," and texts such as contrasting the six perfections. When the Nirvāṇa Sutra explains principle, it refers to texts such as "all sentient beings completely possess mind; all who possess mind will become buddhas."

Question: Regarding the text of the Chapter on Various Vehicles, what does it mean when it says "the Lotus clearly takes wisdom as the One Vehicle and speaks of true suchness in a hidden way"? Answer: Generally, in the Xuanzan and chapters, the places where the One Vehicle is explained through hidden-manifest contrasts are not uniform. All have their reasons. The intention of this Chapter on Various Vehicles is to contrast only the ox-cart with the treasure destination to clarify their manifestness and hiddenness. The meaning is: the original intention of the Lotus is to explain the One Vehicle for undetermined people to make them aspire to seek the wisdom ox-cart. Therefore, the three children ride the same ox-cart and play freely. Hence it says "clearly takes wisdom as the One Vehicle." The treasure destination is a place to be reached in the future, not already reached. Hence it says "speaks of true suchness in a hidden way." This merely cites the original intention of one place and one aspect, not the original intention of the entire text. If not so, there would be contradictions between earlier and later parts. It can also be said that although the One Vehicle of the entire text encompasses both principle and wisdom, the intent of opening the provisional to reveal the real specifically clarifies explaining Buddha's wisdom, while the principle of true suchness is what is revealed beneath. Hence it says "manifestly explains wisdom and speaks of true suchness in a hidden way." Although teaching, principle, practice, and fruit—opening, revealing, awakening, and entering—are all the One Vehicle, the correct meaning of the Lotus takes conditioned wisdom as its essence, while the unconditioned principle serves as essence subsidiarily. This is called "manifest and hidden." (Although this latter meaning broadly harmonizes the Chapter on Various Vehicles, the former meaning is better.)

Question: The chapter states "this is only inclusion, that encompasses generation." What does this mean? Answer: This is the second contrast of inclusion and generation, revealing their differences. The Chapter on Various Vehicles states: "Moreover, the Lotus One Vehicle relies only on inclusion. Because its essence and function are narrow, it is a provisional teaching. The Śrīmālā One Vehicle has both generation and inclusion completely prepared. Therefore it is true and real."

Question: First, what is called inclusion and generation? Answer: The Comprehensive Commentary states: "'This is only inclusion' means breaking two to return to one. 'Your practices are the bodhisattva path.' It speaks of the nine divisions of teachings entering the Mahāyāna as their foundation. All are inclusion. Above and below are not one. 'That encompasses generation' means, examining the Śrīmālā: 'The Mahāyāna generates all wholesome dharmas of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, worldly and transcendent realms. Like the Anavatapta Lake producing eight great rivers. Also like all seeds depending on earth to grow. Thus all wholesome dharmas of śrāvakas and bodhisattvas depend on the Mahāyāna to increase and grow. Also it says: As the World-Honored One taught, the six bases mean the dwelling of true dharma, up to receiving full ordination. For the sake of the Mahāyāna, it explains generation and inclusion, following the sequence of the text.'" In this Śrīmālā Sutra, the analogies of the great lake and seeds explain the meaning of generation, while the six-base dharma explains the meaning of inclusion. The general meaning is: gathering the practices of the two vehicles into the Mahāyāna is called the meaning of inclusion; true principle generating myriad dharmas is called the meaning of generation.

Question: The Śrīmālā Sutra takes principle as the One Vehicle. How does it generate? Answer: The Comprehensive Commentary states: "Like the twelve divisions of teachings flowing equally in dependence on the dharma-realm, serving as basis and called generation. This is also similar, though with some differences in the middle. The wise should contemplate this." The meaning is: calling true principle "generation" does not mean serving as a seed to generate

There are seven types of explanation accomplishment. Namely: 1. Various accomplishments. The sutra says: "Deeply entering the limitless, accomplishing all unprecedented dharmas." Because they deeply enter all unprecedented dharmas of principle and phenomena, emptiness and existence, worldly and transcendent. Because they penetrate without bounds, they can give rise to those various words and phrases. 2. Speech accomplishment. The sutra says: "The Tathāgata can make various distinctions... delighting all minds." Because the Buddha obtained five kinds of beautiful wonderful sounds to explain dharma (1. Profound like thunder; 2. Clear and heard far; 3. Entering the mind with reverence and love; 4. Clear and easy to understand; 5. Listeners never tire). 3. Sign accomplishment. The sutra says: "Taking the essential point... no need to speak further." The commentary says: "Because there are sentient beings who are dharma vessels whose minds are already satisfied, it is called sign accomplishment." For those who are true dharma vessels, making their minds delight in the wonderful dharma. Proclaiming cessation and manifesting signs to make them seek his teaching. What dharma is the Buddha now proclaiming should be stopped and not spoken? Making them inquire about and grasp the One Vehicle. Therefore it is called "sign." 4. Capability accomplishment. The sutra says: "The dharma accomplished by the Buddha, the foremost rare and difficult-to-understand dharma." The commentary says: "All sentient beings to be transformed know that the Tathāgata accomplishes rare merit and is capable of explaining dharma." 5. Immeasurable types accomplishment. The sutra says: "Only Buddha with Buddha can fully fathom the true characteristics of all dharmas." The commentary says: "True characteristics means the essence-nature of Tathāgata-garbha dharma-body that does not change." Buddha wisdom fully knows this true characteristic essence, exhausting its source and foundation, therefore called "fully fathoming." Not only accomplishing the myriad conditioned merits, but also the myriad unconditioned merits - Buddha also fully exhausts these, therefore it says "immeasurable types accomplishment cannot be fully explained." 6. Awakening essence accomplishment. This sutra has no text. The commentary cites the sutra saying: "Because the Tathāgata knows all dharmas." The commentary says: "All dharmas explained by the Tathāgata are realized only by Buddha Tathāgata himself." 7. Following sentient beings' intentions to explain cultivation dharmas accomplishment. The sutra says:

"Namely, all dharmas' such characteristics... up to ultimate, etc." The commentary says: "What dharmas are such, etc." The dharmas explained are what the Buddha directly perceives - there is nothing he does not see. Within this seventh accomplishment are the Ten Suchnesses. The sutra cited in the commentary has five phrases: what dharmas, how dharmas, what-like dharmas, what-characteristic dharmas, what-essence dharmas. The commentary has four explanations. The present sutra explains according to the second "sequential explanatory method." Namely, "such characteristics, such nature" together constitute the first "what dharmas." Characteristics are conditioned, nature is unconditioned. Therefore "such essence" is the fifth "what essence dharmas." Meaning the essence of five aggregates and non-five-aggregates. "Such power, such function" together constitute the third "what-like dharmas." Power refers to permanent dharmas - permanent dharmas have power and capability. Function refers to impermanent dharmas - because they have creation and action. "Such causes, such conditions, such effects, such retributions" together constitute the second "how dharmas." The principle of establishing effects is called causes; the principle of accomplishing retributions is called conditions. Directly obtaining effects is called causes; indirectly obtaining effects is called conditions. The four effects are called effects (1. Superior; 2. Uniform flow; 3. Human action; 4. Separation). Maturation is called retribution. "Such fundamental and derivative" is the fourth "what-characteristic dharmas." The three characteristic dharmas of arising, etc., are derivative essence - they are phenomena. The three characteristics of non-arising, etc., are fundamental essence - they are principle. "Ultimate, etc." again explains that the nature of fundamental principle dharmas is ultimate.

Third, the section on the assembly's fixed doubts. Regarding what they themselves realized, their minds generated certainty, but regarding the Buddha's various explanations, doubts consequently arose. Namely, the sutra says: "At that time in the great assembly there were śrāvakas... wishing to hear the complete path." The commentary says: "From here below, demonstration according to three types of meaning: 1. Certainty meaning; 2. Doubt meaning; 3.

Doubt meaning depending on what matters." The first two are within the assembly's doubts, the third is within Śāriputra's doubts. By examining the text this can be known.

Fourth, the fixed record section. Namely, clearly recording and distinguishing the profound and secret meanings. The sutra says: "At that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: 'Stop, stop! No need to speak further... how much more three [vehicles].'" The commentary says: "From here below, explanation according to four types of matters: 1. Determined mind; 2. Causal conferring of prediction; 3. Accepting conferring of prediction; 4. Giving conferring of prediction." Determined mind means: for those who have already generated fear and alarm, causing them to sever fear and alarm. To benefit two types of people (the second type - those alarmed by many matters; the fourth type - those alarmed by regret), therefore the Tathāgata has determined mind. Meaning the Buddha's mind originally already had determined people to work for. Due to this, there are subsequent stopping and explaining. Therefore, the commentary on determined mind does not assign attribution - the sutra encompasses the meaning of the text below (there are five [types of] alarm). Causal conferring of prediction means the sutra saying: "Stop, stop! No need to speak further... all should be alarmed and doubtful." Namely the two stopping texts below, etc. Due to two meanings for those who should hear (1. Wanting to make the assembly infer the profound realm; 2. Wanting to make the assembly generate reverence and ultimately desire to hear). Because those unable to hear retreat from their seats, it is called "causal" (the second stopping is for the two meanings of those who should hear; the third stopping is for the retreat of those unable to hear the dharma).

Accepting conferring of prediction means permitting reception and promising to explain. Namely the sutra saying: "At that time the World-Honored One told Śāriputra: 'You are already earnest... wishing and delighting to hear.'" The commentary says: "Because Śāriputra and others wish to obtain prediction." Giving conferring of prediction means correctly explaining the One Vehicle, etc. Namely the sutra saying: "The Buddha told Śāriputra: 'Such wonderful dharma... how much more three [vehicles].'" The commentary says there are six types: 1. Making the unheard hear. Meaning praising the dharma as rare to manifest and cause hearing. The sutra says: "Such wonderful dharma, at times it is explained, etc." 2. Explanation. Meaning clarifying that the intention of the explained dharma is difficult to know. The sutra says: "What the buddhas explain according to appropriateness, etc." 3. Depending on what meaning. Meaning making the unheard hear and expedient explanations - depending on what meaning? Namely depending on the profound difficult-to-understand dharma the Buddha obtained. The sutra says: "Buddhas, World-Honored Ones, only for one great matter, etc." 4. Causing to dwell. Meaning encouraging them to come and dwell in the One Vehicle. The sutra says: "The Tathāgata only with one Buddha vehicle, etc." 5. Depending on dharma. Meaning the ritual standards and methods commonly practiced by buddhas of the ten directions and three times. The sutra says: "All dharmas of buddhas in the ten directions, etc." 6. Obstructing. Meaning obstructing and breaking the two attachments. Obstructing and dismissing the two truths. The sutra says: "In worlds of the ten directions there are not even two vehicles, etc." Among the four fixed records, the first determined mind is the common reason for proclaiming stopping and for explaining. The second causal conferring of prediction is merely the reason for stopping their request. Accepting conferring of prediction permits opening and explanation. Giving conferring of prediction correctly demonstrates and presents the record. Within the fourth of these four records, giving conferring of prediction, there are further six records. This should be understood.

Fifth, the doubt-severing section. The commentary says: "From here below the Tathāgata explains dharma to sever four types of doubts: 1. When to explain? 2. How to know conceit? 3. What capability to explain? 4. How not to constitute false speech?" The first doubt's meaning says: "At what time does the Buddha first explain the expedient two vehicles, then clarify the real One Vehicle?" To sever this doubt, the sutra says: "Buddhas appear in the five-turbidity evil world, etc." The second doubt's meaning says: "If the Tathāgata already does not explain for conceited people, how does he know they are conceited?" To sever this doubt, the sutra says: "If my disciples consider themselves arhats... are not pratyeka-

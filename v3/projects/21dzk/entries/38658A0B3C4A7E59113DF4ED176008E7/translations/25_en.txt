The Water Commentary states: "It breaks their attachment mind, not the dharma essence. Because Two Vehicle people each cling to their own vehicle's cultivated teachings, principles, practices, and fruitions as ultimate and are unwilling to cultivate the Great [Vehicle]. The World-Honored One breaks the attachment mind. Therefore it says: 'In the worlds of the ten directions, there is only the One Vehicle dharma—no two and no three.' By teaching that only the One Vehicle exists, the Two Vehicles' mind of attachment is immediately broken. It is like having three jewels—two are small and are smashed and not used, while one large true golden jewel is kept."

Question: Among those of fixed and unfixed nature, whom does it break?

Answer: The Water Commentary has two explanations. First: "It breaks all. If they are of fixed nature, it breaks them so they are not ignorant of dharma. If they are of unfixed nature, it breaks them so they turn their minds [to the Great Vehicle]." Second: "It only breaks people of unfixed nature."

Question: According to the latter explanation, why are those of fixed nature not broken?

Answer: The commentary states: "People of fixed nature do not realize the Great [Vehicle]. What need is there to break them?"

Question: Which of the two explanations is superior?

Answer: The commentary states: "The first explanation is superior."

Question: The treatise states: "As the sutra says: 'Among those who seek the three vehicles, if there are any who harbor nets of doubt, the Buddha will remove and sever them completely without remainder.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This quotes evidence to establish the reason for teaching one in order to break separate attachment minds. There are five texts of quoted evidence. This is the first text.

Question: How does this text serve as evidence?

Answer: "People who seek the three vehicles" refers to: first, śrāvakas who cling to their own fruition as ultimate; second, pratyekabuddhas who cling to their own fruition as ultimate; third, gradual awakening lesser bodhisattvas whose great practices are not yet accomplished and who also cling to the Two Vehicles as ultimate. These are called people who seek the three vehicles. The attachments of these three people are called "nets of doubt" (the sutra text calls them "doubt and regret"). To remove and sever these nets of doubt, the One Vehicle is then taught. This is called teaching one in order to break separate attachments. Therefore this text is quoted as evidence and can establish that meaning.

Question: This text is about breaking doubt, so why quote it as evidence for breaking attachment?

Answer: The Water Commentary states: "Attachment arises from where there is doubt. If doubt is not generated, attachment also does not exist. Therefore it quotes sutra text about generating doubt to prove breaking attachment. First doubting the object in front, then afterward generating attachment—this explains according to the root cause."

Question: The treatise states: "Śāriputra also said: 'However, we did not understand the expedient teachings according to circumstances. When we first heard the Buddha's dharma, we immediately believed and accepted it upon encountering it, and so forth, severing all doubts and regrets.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the second piece of evidence.

Question: How does this text prove the meaning of teaching one to break separate attachment minds?

Answer: In this text, "However, we... immediately believed and accepted upon encountering it, etc." describes the reason why in the past, not knowing the Buddha's expedient teachings, upon hearing Small Vehicle teachings, they immediately believed, accepted, contemplated, and realized them. The text "severing all doubts and regrets" precisely establishes this evidence. Therefore the complete text states: "From ancient times until now, day and night, I constantly blamed myself, but now hearing from the Buddha unprecedented dharma never heard before, I have severed all doubts and regrets." The Xuanzan commentary states: "Not yet hearing about cultivating the small, exclusively regretting and blaming oneself for not seeking the great. Also doubting that bodhi has no portion for oneself, not generating aspiration and pursuit. Or again, one's own body has already attained liberation and has no difference from Buddha. Hearing that what the Buddha now teaches—the dharma attained by Buddha—is extremely profound and difficult to understand, and the Two Vehicles do not comprehend it, they doubt the Buddha to be a demon. Now having heard the teaching of one real and three provisional, knowing that formerly cultivating the small was the cause for the great, therefore regret is severed. Knowing that they already have a portion in Buddha's bodhi, and that the liberation attained is the Buddha's expedient means, therefore doubt is also severed." Now these doubts and regrets are called attachments. Hearing this sutra taught removes and severs these attachments. This is called teaching one to break separate attachments. Therefore this text can establish that evidence.

As a side discussion, the Xuanzan commentary states: "Question: When doubt arises and discrimination enters into view,

it is immediately removed. Regret mostly accompanies worry and is abandoned when desire is abandoned. How does Śāriputra now remove both at once?" How should this be answered?

Answer: It then states: "Afflictive doubt is exhausted upon stream-entry. Regret as a companion of afflictions is already removed upon abandoning desire. Now dharma-attachment types and innate doubts are like arhats who doubt black salt. Doubt regarding phenomena, evil actions called regret, do not yet contradict principle. The essence of these evil actions is precisely wholesome shame, because they lightly reject violence and evil" (there is a second explanation for regret, but it is omitted for brevity).

Question: How does the treatise author call doubt "attachment"?

Answer: Regarding Śāriputra's doubt, because it is a type of dharma-attachment, it is called attachment. However, the Water Commentary states: "Originally, attachment comes through doubt. Therefore know that when doubt is exhausted, attachment is also absent." This explains according to afflictive doubt and should be contemplated.

Question: The treatise states: "Kāśyapa also said: 'Also, we have now attained the realization of nirvana, and regarding bodhisattva dharmas, we do not generate minds of delight.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the third piece of evidence.

Question: How does it serve as evidence?

Answer: This text contains Mahākāśyapa's words of understanding. The complete text states: "The World-Honored One enabled us to exit the three realms and attain the realization of nirvana. Also, we are now aged and decrepit, and regarding the unsurpassed bodhi through which the Buddha teaches and transforms bodhisattvas, we do not generate even one thought of delight." The Xuanzan commentary states: "First, having completed the path without suffering, the mind is peaceful. Second, being already aged with teeth worn and strength diminished, therefore regarding the great dharma, since it is not their aspiration, they have no mind of delight." Now, thinking in the past that they had attained nirvana and having no mind of delight regarding unsurpassed bodhi is called attachment. Hearing this sutra taught removes and severs this attachment. This is called teaching one to break separate attachments. Therefore it can establish evidence. Therefore the first [volume of] Xuanzan also explains this text, stating: "These are all past attachments to the Small Vehicle," which is the same as this.

Question: What kind of dharma is "bodhisattva dharmas" in the treatise text?

【Lower Section】

Answer: The sutra text at this point states "regarding the unsurpassed bodhi through which the Buddha teaches and transforms bodhisattvas." Therefore it points to unsurpassed bodhi and calls it bodhisattva dharmas. If we additionally quote the sutra's preceding text, bodhisattva dharmas would be the thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening (as in the Xuanzan).

Question: The treatise states: "The Compendium Treatise also says: 'Severing and removing the four obstacles—Two Vehicle mental application, etc.—these are precisely these attachments.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the fourth piece of evidence.

Question: How does it serve as evidence?

Answer: The four obstacles are: first, Two Vehicle mental application obstacle; second, various doubt obstacles (the Xuanzan commentary states: "Various doubts and freedom from doubt, etc. Freedom from doubt is the name of the antidote. It is added according to the force of expression"); third, regarding heard and contemplated dharmas, saying "I am capable while others are not capable" obstacle; fourth, regarding bones and chains... up to bodhi, the obstacle of clinging and discrimination. Among these four, the first Two Vehicle mental application obstacle and the third "regarding heard and contemplated dharmas, saying I am capable while others are not capable" obstacle can establish this evidence. Therefore the Xuanzan commentary states: "Two Vehicle practitioners cling to the two fruitions as ultimate. Therefore, to sever this, this sutra is taught. Gradual awakening bodhisattvas cling to the idea that Buddha's bodhi has no portion for themselves, wanting to generate retreat and failure and return to dwell in the Two Vehicles. This is to maintain and uphold them without allowing retreat. Also, sudden awakening various lesser bodhisattvas cling to the idea that only they, depending on the Mahayana for cultivation, can attain Buddhahood, while those already dwelling in the śrāvaka [vehicle] cannot become Buddhas. Now breaking this attachment, it reveals that the Two Vehicles are not ultimate—those dwelling in the Two Vehicles can also become Buddhas. Therefore this teaching is explained. Due to this, the Compendium Treatise's words about severing the four obstacles—first, Two Vehicle mental application, and third, saying I am capable while others are not capable—are precisely these two types." The meaning is: Two Vehicle mental application obstacle is the attachment generated by Two Vehicle practitioners and gradual awakening lesser bodhisattvas. The "I am capable while others are not capable" obstacle is the attachment generated by sudden awakening lesser bodhisattvas. To break these two [attachments]

to break attachment minds, this One Vehicle sutra is taught. This is called breaking separate attachments to teach one. Therefore it can establish the evidence.

Question: Why are the second and fourth obstacles not used as this evidence?

Answer: The second obstacle is doubt through erroneous and deviant wisdom regarding the various dharma gates of the Mahayana. Its essence is dharma attachment. The fourth obstacle is discriminating mind regarding realms produced by karma of form, etc., and realms produced by concentrations on bones and chains, etc. Its essence is also dharma attachment. These two obstacles have different meanings. Therefore they do not establish evidence for breaking separateness to teach one. Hence they are not used as evidence.

As a side discussion: Question: What are the antidote dharmas for these four obstacles?

Answer: The three types of mind-refining. Namely: first, bodhi being vast—using others to compare with oneself in training; second, the myriad practices being difficult to cultivate—reflecting on oneself to increase cultivation training; third, transformation-basis being difficult to realize—using the coarse to compare with the subtle in training. Therefore the Consciousness-Only Treatise states: "First, hearing that unsurpassed perfect bodhi is vast and profound, the mind becomes discouraged. Drawing upon others who have realized great bodhi to refine and train one's own mind with courage and non-retreat. Second, hearing that giving and other perfections are extremely difficult to cultivate, the mind becomes discouraged. Reflecting on one's own intentions and pleasures, being able to cultivate giving, etc., refining and training one's own mind with courage and non-retreat. Third, hearing that the perfect transformation-basis of all Buddhas is extremely difficult to realize, the mind becomes discouraged. Drawing upon others' coarse good to compare with one's own subtle causes, refining and training one's own mind with courage and non-retreat." Through these three types of mind-refining, one can sever these four obstacles.

Question: These three minds treat the previous three discouragements as antidote dharmas. Why then do they treat these four obstacles?

Answer: Bodhisattvas in the accumulation stage have the previous three discouragements. However, through these three types of mind-refining, when courageously non-retreating, they immediately sever these

four obstacles.

Question: If so, why are there three antidotes but four things treated?

Answer: These three mind-refinings are not the direct antidotes. Through these three mind-refinings, when firmly and intensely cultivating various excellent practices, observing signlessness, observing the three natures, observing dharma-emptiness, and observing the absence of perceiver and perceived, they respectively sever these four obstacles. The antidotes are called the four wisdoms, and what is treated is called the four obstacles.

Question: At what stage are these four obstacles severed?

Answer: The Compendium Commentary states: "At the ten faith stage, the first obstacle is severed, because one abandons the small mind and initially enters the Mahayana ten faith stage. At the ten understanding stage, the second obstacle is severed, because one abandons doubt and confusion regarding the Mahayana, thus attaining correct understanding and cultivating bodhisattva practices. At the ten dedications up to the forbearance stage, the third obstacle is severed, because one performs perverted discrimination contemplation to eliminate attachments. At the highest worldly dharma stage, the fourth obstacle is severed, because the discriminative contemplative wisdom and preparatory practices of the highest worldly dharma cease, accomplishing the supreme awakening of the first ground" (The Compendium Treatise is vast and profound, suddenly difficult to understand. See the first volume of the Compendium Commentary for details).

Question: The treatise states: "The base treatise also says at the end: 'The Expedient Means chapter has five parts. It demonstrates breaking two to clarify one. It does not teach breaking three, etc.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the fifth piece of evidence.

Question: How does this text serve as evidence?

Answer: Since it already states "demonstrates breaking two to clarify one," it clearly shows teaching one to break separate attachment minds. Therefore it can establish the evidence.

Question: Among these five parts, how does it demonstrate breaking two to clarify one?

Answer: The five parts are: First, the part praising dharma—praising the excellence of the dharma realized and taught (the sutra states "the wisdom of all Buddhas is extremely profound and immeasurable, etc."). Second, the part praising the dharma teacher—praising the excellence of the dharma teacher who realizes and teaches (the sutra states "since attaining Buddhahood, various causes and conditions, etc."). Third, the part establishing doubt—the great assembly having doubts about what the Buddha taught (the sutra states "at that time in the great assembly, there were various śrāvakas... up to

wanting to hear the complete path, etc."). Fourth, the part establishing prediction—clearly predicting and distinguishing the profound and subtle meaning (the sutra states "at that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: Stop, stop, no need to speak further... there are not even two vehicles, how much more three, etc."). Fifth, the part severing doubt—severing the doubts of the great assembly (the sutra states "all Buddhas emerge from the five turbid evil world, etc.").

Among these five parts, the first three parts do not yet clarify the reason for teaching breaking two to clarify one. They only praise the dharma and dharma teacher, and in expressing the assembly's doubts, show the characteristics of breaking two to clarify one. In the fourth and fifth parts, they clearly teach the meaning of breaking two to clarify one. Namely, in the establishing prediction part it states: "The Tathāgata, solely with the One Buddha Vehicle, teaches dharma for sentient beings. There are no other vehicles—neither two nor three." It also states: "In the worlds of the ten directions there are no Two Vehicles, how much more three, etc." In the severing doubt part it states: "All Buddhas, through the power of expedient means, distinctly teach three within the One Buddha Vehicle, etc."

Question: What is the meaning of "does not teach breaking three, etc." in the treatise text?

Answer: This simultaneously breaks the ancient masters and further establishes one's own position. Using the treatise text as evidence, it breaks the ancient masters' [claim that] one is taught to break three, and instead establishes one's own meaning.

Question: The treatise states: "Some say: Because it breaks the three attachments, it is not only breaking two. Like the Sarvāstivādins clinging to the Buddha's transformation body as the true Buddha. Now teaching it as transformation, therefore breaking the three attachments." What does this mean?

Answer: This describes the doctrine of the ancient masters—namely the doctrine of Tiantai and other masters.

Question: What is the meaning of this ancient masters' doctrine?

Answer: The ancient masters meant: "The Buddha formerly taught the Three Vehicles, now teaches the One Vehicle, breaking the former Three Vehicles. It is not breaking two within the three. Like the Sarvāstivādins establishing the Buddha's three bodies, clinging to the transformation body that attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree as the true reward Buddha. Now immediately breaking that, teaching it is a transformation body. Together breaking the three bodies. This is also like this" (The Water Commentary states: "The three bodies as conceived by the Abhidharma school: clinging to the five-part dharma body as the dharma body; the sixteen-foot body that attained perfect enlightenment through thirty-four mental moments under the Bodhi tree is called the grasped body, corresponding to the transformation body in the Mahayana; bodies of various types like monkeys, deer, horses, dragons, spirits, etc. are called transformation bodies. The ancients drew this parallel. In the Lotus Sutra there are also those who cling to the Three Vehicles and return to the One Vehicle").

Question: How is this ancient masters' doctrine refuted?

Answer: The treatise breaks this with two meanings.

Question: What are these two refutations?

Answer: The treatise states: "This is also incorrect (this is the general refutation). The Lotus Sutra solely takes the One Vehicle that one has personally attained and cultivated as its principle, harmonizing and breaking their vehicles to make them enter the one. It does not take the known one body as its principle to harmonize and break their bodies to make them enter the one body (this is the first refutation). Moreover, there is no clinging to that transformation body as ultimate, pursuing and seeking to reach it without further pursuing other bodies. Now breaking that attachment to make them seek the one body. Therefore it only breaks clinging to the Two Vehicles as ultimate, not breaking clinging to those two bodies as ultimate (this is the second refutation)."

Question: What is the meaning of the first refutation?

Answer: The meaning of the first refutation states: "The intention of the Lotus is solely to take the One Vehicle personally cultivated and attained by the Tathāgata as its principle, harmonizing and breaking the ultimate fruition clung to by the Two Vehicles to make them return to the One Vehicle. It does not take the known one real body as its principle to harmonize and break the transformation bodies known by the Two Vehicles to make them return to the one real body. Therefore what is compared becomes even more like fire and water." The Water Commentary states: "The commentary master's intention does not obstruct having this attachment, but because it does not correspond with the principles here, it is not permitted. The meaning is: if the Lotus Sutra took the one body as its principle, then those who cling to the Buddha's transformation body as ultimate would need to be broken. Our sutra takes the One Vehicle as its principle—why would it need to break this? Vehicles are what is cultivated, therefore they must be broken. Bodies are what is known—why must they be broken?"

Question: The ancient masters' intention was generally to draw parallels to establish the meaning of the Lotus, not saying that within the Lotus, taking the one body as principle to break that transformation body and make them enter the one body is comparable. Why then do the refuting words not [match] the ancient masters'

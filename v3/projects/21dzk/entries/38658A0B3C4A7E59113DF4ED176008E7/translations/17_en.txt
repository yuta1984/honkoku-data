practices, therefore it is divided into two.

Question: Bodhisattva practices are countless. Why are they fixed as these four practices?

Answer: The myriad practices of bodhisattvas are completely encompassed by these four practices. Therefore the Profound Praise states: "By these four practices, all practices are completely encompassed."

Question: The treatise states: "It also says: 'Riding this jewel vehicle, going directly to the place of enlightenment. This is practicing the Great Vehicle.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the third evidence.

Question: How does this text serve as proof?

Answer: This text clarifies the practices of Three Vehicle people riding the One Vehicle omniscience cart, cultivating the practices of the ten grounds, and reaching the Buddha fruit. Therefore it can prove practicing the Great Vehicle. (The text's meaning is as recorded above.)

Question: The treatise states: "The Compendium of the Great Vehicle says: 'Because it is both vehicle and great, it is called Great Vehicle.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the fourth evidence.

Question: How does it prove this?

Answer: There are seven meanings in explaining "great," all clarifying bodhisattva practices. (As recorded at the beginning.) "Vehicle" means the meaning of conveying and carrying. Since it already says "both vehicle and great," this uses the karmadhāraya interpretation to say "vehicle"—because it is great, it is called Great Vehicle. Therefore, using this text, one can prove practicing the Great Vehicle. (The Profound Praise says: "Both vehicle and great—namely the myriad practices." This is the same.)

Question: The treatise states: "The Discrimination of the Middle and Extremes explains the ten perfections, calling them 'supreme correct practices.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the fifth evidence.

Question: How does it prove this?

Answer: That treatise explains: depending on cultivating the distinctions of the ten perfections within the ten grounds, there are six correct practices—namely supreme intention, etc. All are correct practices of bodhisattvas. Therefore this text is cited to prove fundamental practices of the One Vehicle. (As recorded in the side discussion of the first section.)

Question: The treatise states: "Expedient practices—the Śrīmālā [Sūtra] also says: 'The abiding of true dharma, etc., are explained for the Great Vehicle.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This clarifies expedient practices and immediately cites evidence. There are two. This is the first evidence. (The text's meaning was recorded above.)

Question: The treatise states: "Depending on the Tripiṭaka teachings, advancing good and eliminating evil, following the uncontaminated practices—all practice the Great Vehicle."

【Lower Section】

What does this mean?

Answer: This explains the Śrīmālā Sūtra text cited above and clarifies the reason why expedient practices are called practicing the One Vehicle. The meaning is: the six dharmas of true dharma abiding, etc., point to the dharmas explained in the previous Lesser Vehicle Tripiṭaka teachings. "Explained for the Great Vehicle" reveals that what was previously explained—the lesser teachings—were explained as expedient means for later entering the Great Vehicle. When the Two Vehicle practitioners hear the Lesser Vehicle Tripiṭaka teachings and cultivate good, eliminate evil, practice uncontaminated practices, and attain uncontaminated fruits—all these are practices of Great Vehicle expedient means. Therefore these are called expedient practice Great Vehicle.

Question: This sūtra text was cited above to prove expedient teachings. Why is it now also cited to prove expedient practices?

Answer: By this one can say: this "depending on Tripiṭaka teachings, advancing good and eliminating evil, etc." also addresses implicit objections. The intent of the objection is like today's question, which is immediately answered. The meaning is: above, the teachings that can express were cited as evidence for expedient teachings. Now, the practices cultivated depending on teachings are raised as evidence for expedient practices. Therefore citing both has no problem.

Question: The treatise states: "The Lotus Treatise says: 'Expedient means: śrāvakas contemplate the aggregates, sense-fields, and elements, being disgusted with suffering and separating from suffering. Bodhisattvas cultivate the practices of six perfections and four attractions for dual benefit.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the second evidence.

Question: How does it serve as proof?

Answer: That śrāvakas contemplate the aggregates, sense-fields, and elements, being disgusted with and separating from suffering—this is expedient explanation. Therefore this text is cited to prove expedient means. The text about bodhisattvas cultivating the six perfections, etc., is brought in due to context. Also, it clarifies by contrast.

Question: What does this text mean?

Answer: This text discusses "dependent dharma," within which there are four kinds of dharmas: expedient means, causes and conditions, similes, and contemplative observation. To explain the first expedient means, there is this text. It immediately generates the text saying: "Expedient means: in the Lesser Vehicle, contemplating aggregates, sense-fields, and elements,

being disgusted with and separating from suffering, attaining liberation. In the Great Vehicle, using the various perfections and four attraction methods to gather the beneficial antidote dharmas for self and others." The meaning is: past buddhas, using countless expedient means, in the Lesser Vehicle explained practices of contemplating aggregates, sense-fields, and elements to separate from suffering and attain liberation; in the Great Vehicle explained practices of cultivating six perfections and four attractions for self-benefit and benefiting others. The present Buddha also depends on those previous Buddha dharmas to establish these expedient means. Therefore it is called "dependent dharma."

Question: What are those aggregates, sense-fields, and elements?

Answer: The Water Commentary says: "The five aggregates, twelve sense-fields, and eighteen elements. Depending on the three categories, one makes the four noble truths contemplation. Being disgusted with birth, old age, sickness, death, etc., is called 'disgust with suffering.' When later attaining the fruit, it is called 'separation from suffering.' The uninterrupted path both disgusts and separates. The liberation path only separates, not disgusts."

Question: What is the meaning of these three categories?

Answer: "Aggregate" (skandha) is the old translation. The new translation says "heap" (yun). Heaps have three meanings. The Middle and Extremes verse says: "Non-unity, summary, and the meaning of division are called heaps." The first is the meaning of non-unity. As the sūtra says: "All forms, whether past, future, or present, whether internal or external, whether coarse or subtle, whether inferior or superior, whether far or near." Form initially has these eleven, and even the fifth consciousness has these eleven. Therefore it is called "non-unity." The second is the summary meaning. As the sūtra says: "All such [phenomena] are summarized as one collection." Form has eleven in total: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and dharma-sphere form. These eleven are collectively established as one form aggregate. Therefore it is called "summary." Sensation has three sensations, etc., collectively forming one sensation aggregate. Perception has various perceptions, collectively forming one perception aggregate. Formations contain many dharmas, collectively forming one formations aggregate. Consciousness has eight kinds, collectively forming one consciousness aggregate. This is called "summary." The third is the division meaning.

【Lower Section】

As the sūtra says: "Explained as called form aggregate, etc., because the characteristics of form, etc., are separately established." The five characteristics of form, sensation, perception, formations, and consciousness are each separate. This is called the division meaning. Due to these three meanings, the collection meaning is called "heap."

Next, "element" (dhātu)—the verse says: "Grasper, grasped, and that-grasping—the seed meaning is called element." The grasper seed meaning (perhaps there is "者" in one text after "meaning") refers to the six internal elements of eye, etc. Because they can grasp form, etc., they are called "grasper." The grasped seed meaning refers to the six external elements of form, etc. Because they are grasped by eye, etc., they are called "grasped." The that-grasping seed meaning refers to the six consciousness elements of eye-consciousness, etc. "That" refers to sense-faculties and objects. Depending on faculties and conditioning on objects, consciousness can discriminate. Therefore it is called "that-grasping." These three are called "seeds." Seeds are the element meaning. Therefore manifestation is also called "seeds" as elements.

Next, "entrance" (āyatana) is the old translation. The new translation says "base" (chu). The verse says: "Capable receiver, understood objects—the meaning of functional gateway is called base." The meaning of gateway for capable receiving and utilizing refers to the six internal bases. The capable receivers are the six faculties. The utilizers are the six consciousnesses. Because the six faculties serve as gateways for the six consciousnesses' utilization. The meaning of gateway for understood objects and utilization refers to the six external bases. The understood are the six objects. The utilizers are the six consciousnesses. Because the six objects serve as the function for the six consciousnesses' utilization. Gateway means the path by which [something comes]. Because faculties and objects serve as the objects by which consciousness arises, they are called gateways. (See the detailed explanation in Three Categories doctrine.)

Question: Regarding the six perfections and four attractions cultivated by bodhisattvas being called "dual benefit practices," what does this mean?

Answer: The six perfections—giving, etc.—are self-benefit practices. The four attractions—giving, kind words, beneficial conduct, and cooperation—are other-benefit practices. Therefore they are called dual benefit practices. Also, following the power of intention, all advance both self-benefit and other-benefit practices. Therefore it is called "dual benefit."

Question: The treatise states: "Due to these two practices, all

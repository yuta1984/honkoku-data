afflictions as the truth of origination. With-remainder and without-remainder nirvana as the truth of cessation. Person-emptiness wisdom as the truth of the path.
The unconstructed four truths take: transformational birth-and-death as the truth of suffering, cognitive obstructions as the truth of origination, non-abiding nirvana as the truth of cessation, and the category of dharma-emptiness wisdom as the truth of the path."

Question: Why do śrāvakas know the constructed while Buddha knows the unconstructed?

Answer: Following each one's capacity, there are shallow and deep aspects in realizing principle, therefore it is so.

Question: If it is said that śrāvakas know the constructed, then why does the Profound Praise cite the Śrīmālā Sūtra saying "Such eight noble truths are not known by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas"?

Answer: That Buddha knows the eight noble truths, but the Two Vehicles only know the first four truths and have not yet known the latter four noble truths. Therefore it says "such eight truths are not known by the Two Vehicles." Also, regarding the first four noble truths, they only know the shallow principle and have not yet known the deep principle. Therefore it generally says "the eight truths are not known by the Two Vehicles." (The reason can be known from the text below.)

Question: The treatise states: "The Nirvana [Sūtra] also says: 'Śrāvakas have suffering and have truth, but do not have reality. Bodhisattvas possess all.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the second evidence.

Question: How does this text serve as proof?

Answer: "Having suffering" means knowing the matters of suffering—namely the three sufferings, etc. "Having truth" means knowing the principle of suffering—namely knowing that suffering is truly suffering. Because the Buddha taught that the truth of suffering is real and cannot be made pleasurable. "Not having reality" means not knowing that suffering is like the unconditioned principle. "Bodhisattvas possess all" means knowing the matters of suffering, knowing the principle of suffering, and knowing suffering as such. However, the text about bodhisattvas possessing all is brought in due to the context. Also, this phrase proves the reason why the above phrase is expedient. Therefore this text is cited as evidence for expediency.

Question: Śrāvakas use person-emptiness wisdom to realize person-emptiness true suchness, so why is it said they "do not have reality"?

【Lower Section】

Answer: The Water Commentary answers: "Because they lack dharma-emptiness suchness, it is said they have no reality. That bodhisattvas possess all means they cultivate the unconstructed four truths, know that suffering is illusory and has no real substance, and realize both person- and dharma-emptiness true suchness principle in pairs. This is called having suffering, having truth, and having reality." The meaning is: realizing partial true suchness is called "not having," while truly realizing complete suchness is called "having reality." (See the detailed explanation in Two Truths doctrine.)

Question: The treatise states: "The base treatise also says: 'Contemplative observation means śrāvakas contemplate person-selflessness, etc.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the third evidence.

Question: How does this text serve as proof?

Answer: Person-selflessness refers to person-emptiness true suchness principle. Because this is what the Two Vehicles realize, it is called expedient principle. Therefore it becomes evidence.

Question: What does this treatise text mean?

Answer: This text is the complete passage from the treatise cited in the fundamental principle section above. That text says: "Contemplative observation means: in the Lesser Vehicle, contemplating person-selflessness, etc.; in the Great Vehicle, contemplating dharma-selflessness, etc." The lower phrase proves the previous fundamental principle; the upper phrase proves this expedient principle. (As above, it is easy to understand.)

Question: The treatise states: "Due to these two principles, all are principle One Vehicle." What does this mean?

Answer: This is the conclusion. The Water Commentary says: "Due to these two principles refers to the two principles of fundamental and expedient. The essential nature of principle is originally one. Due to Two Vehicle people realizing the provisional but not obtaining the real, due to these two principles, all are One Vehicle."

Question: The treatise states: "Fundamental practices refer to the six perfections, etc.—the myriad practices of bodhisattvas." What does this mean?

Answer: This clarifies fundamental practices.

Question: How does it clarify this?

Answer: The six perfections of giving, etc., up to the four methods of attraction, etc.—the myriad practices of bodhisattvas before and on the grounds—all are fundamental practices. Therefore it says so.

Question: The treatise states: "The Bodhisattva Stages explains the four bodhisattva practices cultivated in the seven stages." What does this mean?

Answer: This is citing evidence

【Left Page】

There are five. The first cites the text from the Yogācāra Bodhisattva Stages.

Question: How does this text serve as proof?

Answer: Since it says it explains the four bodhisattva practices, it can serve as evidence for fundamental practices.

Question: What are those seven stages?

Answer: 1. Stage of Family Lineage (the position before the ten faiths where one has not yet aroused the mind, abiding in bodhisattva family lineage). 2. Stage of Resolute Practice (from the ten faiths up to the highest worldly dharma position). 3. Stage of Pure Superior Intent (first ground path of seeing). 4. Stage of Correct Practice (from first ground path of cultivation to seventh ground). 5. Stage of Determination (eighth ground). 6. Stage of Determined Practice (ninth ground). 7. Stage of Ultimate Attainment (tenth ground).

Question: Why are the ordinary person stage and pre-ground and on-ground stages collectively called seven stages?

Answer: Following the similarity of practice characteristics, they are categorized and collectively called seven stages. The meaning is: the second Stage of Resolute Practice has thirty minds, with differences between the accumulation and preparation positions. However, based on cultivating resolute practice, it is collectively called the Stage of Resolute Practice. The fourth Stage of Correct Practice, although there are differences among the seven grounds, because all practices are cultivated within the same practice, it is collectively called the Stage of Correct Practice. The rest are named according to their manifest practices, therefore they are the seven stages.

Question: What is the scope compared to the thirteen abodes?

Answer: There is no difference in scope. (See the detailed explanation in Consciousness-Only doctrine.)

Question: What are those four bodhisattva practices?

Answer: 1. Perfection practices (cultivating the six perfections). 2. Practices for accomplishing sentient beings (cultivating the four methods of attraction, etc.). 3. Practices of enlightenment factors (cultivating the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment). 4. Supernatural power practices (using the six supernatural powers to subdue heretics, etc.).

Question: Are these four practices performed by one person, or do four persons each perform one practice?

Answer: These are performed by one person.

Question: Bodhisattva practices are countless. Why are only these four practices mentioned?

Answer: Although there are myriad practices, these four encompass them all. Therefore these four are called bodhisattva practices.

Question: The treatise states: "The Peaceful Practices chapter—all are bodhisattva practices." What does this mean?

Answer: This is the second evidence.

Question: How does this

【Lower Section】

text serve as proof?

Answer: The Peaceful Practices chapter of the Lotus clarifies the four peaceful practices of bodhisattvas. Therefore this text is cited as evidence for fundamental practices.

Question: What are those four practices?

Answer: 1. Correct bodily practice. 2. Correct verbal practice. 3. Mental separation from various evils—self-benefit practice. 4. Mental cultivation of various goods—benefiting others practice.

Question: What do these four practices mean?

Answer: The first correct bodily practice clarifies separating from evil bodily actions and realizing good bodily actions. There are two places: 1. Places of practice. 2. Places to approach closely. Places of practice means: cultivating emptiness and existence practices to eliminate false thoughts, arousing true mind at the gate of emptiness, and practicing dual contemplation of emptiness and existence at the gate of existence. Only then is the Middle Way accomplished. This is the place of practice. Places to approach closely means: separating from external evil conditions that should not be approached closely, and conversely showing not separating from external good conditions that should be approached closely. Also, externally contemplating true dharmas that should be approached closely, and conversely showing externally contemplating false dharmas that should not be approached closely. This is called correct bodily practice.

The second correct verbal practice clarifies separating from evil verbal actions and cultivating good verbal actions. Separating from evil verbal actions means: not praising oneself and disparaging others, not praising or disparaging others, and not speaking of dharma faults. Cultivating good verbal actions means: if there are difficult questions, not answering with Lesser Vehicle [teachings], etc. This is called correct verbal practice.

Mental separation from various evils—self-benefit practice clarifies mentally separating from various jealousies, flattery, deception, etc., and not troubling others or making sport of dharma, etc. This is called mental separation from evil actions.

Mental cultivation of various goods—benefiting others practice clarifies mentally cultivating great compassion and great loving-kindness, teaching and transforming bodhisattvas and non-bodhisattva persons, etc. This is called mental cultivation of various good actions.

Question: Why does clarifying bodily and verbal practices each constitute one, while clarifying mental practices is divided into two?

Answer: The two practices of body and speech are only self-benefit practices, therefore each has one. Within mental practices there are both self-benefit and benefit of others

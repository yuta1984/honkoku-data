This is the doctrine of One Vehicle. As explained above, it is also called Mahāyāna Supreme Vehicle, but this is not what this sūtra clarifies. Therefore the reason is briefly not explained.

The above concludes the second section.

What is the meaning of the third section that clarifies the intent of teaching? Answer: To clarify the reason for teaching One Vehicle is the intent of this section.

Question: How do we know this? Answer: The section on establishing and abandoning the doctrines of various vehicles states: "Why establish One? Because there are those of determined nature who should become two-vehicle practitioners. Because there are those of seedless nature who should become five-vehicle practitioners." (This is the question.) "There are ten doctrines for this." (This is the answer.) Therefore we know that clarifying the reason for teaching One Vehicle is the intent of this section. Also, the Water Commentary states: "Speaking of clarifying the teaching intent means: The Buddha taught five vehicles. This is truly ultimate meaning. With inherent nature and no-nature, there is becoming Buddha and not becoming Buddha. Now when it speaks of 'no two, no three,' what intent is there? Therefore this section comes." Also, the Compendium Treatise states: "With what intent is One Vehicle taught?" All clarify the meaning of this section.

Question: The treatise states: "The Compendium of Mahāyāna states: 'To attract and gather one type, and to sustain the remainder, due to undetermined seed-nature the Buddhas teach One Vehicle. Because dharma, selflessness, liberation, etc. are equal. Though natures are not the same, gaining the two aspirations, in transformation ultimately teaches One Vehicle.'" What does this mean? Answer: This indicates that there are ten causes for teaching One Vehicle, quoting the verse text from the Compendium Treatise.

Question: The treatise states: "Among these ten causes, first is to attract and gather one type of undetermined seed-nature śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, enabling them to attain parinirvāṇa depending on Mahāyāna." What does this mean? Answer: Above it quoted the Compendium of Mahāyāna text, now it explains those ten causes. "Among these ten causes" refers back to the verse text quoted above. "First for..." etc. is

the correct explanation. This is the first cause. The Compendium Treatise states: "Knowing that undetermined seed-nature śrāvakas proceed toward that liberation, through skillful means attracting and gathering them, enabling them to attain parinirvāṇa depending on Mahāyāna, therefore One Vehicle is taught."

Question: The treatise states: "The Lotus assembly mostly teaches One Vehicle for this type." What does this mean? Answer: This uses the first cause from the Compendium Treatise to explain the reason this sūtra teaches One Vehicle. The meaning is: this sūtra teaches One Vehicle, like the first cause in the Compendium Treatise, to attract and gather one type of undetermined-nature people.

Question: Do these undetermined-nature people only turn their minds when attracted and gathered? If not attracted and gathered, do they enter remainderless nirvāṇa or not? Answer: Even if so, what fault would there be? Question: Both have only faults. If they do not encounter attraction and gathering, they definitely enter remainderless nirvāṇa, then gems and stones are burned together - how could this be called undetermined nature? If they do not enter remainderless nirvāṇa, they naturally turn their minds - why would attraction and gathering be needed? Answer: The Water Commentary states: "There are explanations by two masters. Mingxi says: 'These arhats have matured small-vehicle roots but unmatured Mahāyāna roots. When not encountering Buddha's attraction and gathering, they immediately enter remainderless nirvāṇa in the śrāvaka vehicle.' Second, Cien says: 'What seed-nature determines, they must turn their minds. There are none who attain parinirvāṇa in lesser vehicles. Due to carrying these seeds, their inherent nature is benevolent and worthy. Whether the World-Honored One attracts and gathers or not, they necessarily turn their minds.'"

Question: Regarding Cien's doctrine, if even without attraction and gathering they necessarily turn their minds, why is attraction and gathering needed? Answer: The Water Commentary states: "The World-Honored One's compassion fears they might become wildly stagnant and delayed in the two vehicles. The Tathāgata's intent in attraction and gathering is to enable early mind-turning. Like a chicken breaking an egg, how could one lose the timing and not transform? If there were no Buddha's transformation, lacking the power of conditions, it is like bodhisattvas who enter the eighth ground being determined not to regress, yet requiring the Buddha's seven encouragements. If not encouraged, they would be delayed. These śrāvakas are the same. Obtaining the Buddha's attraction and gathering, turning their minds toward the great, their cultivation becomes swift."

Question: The treatise states: "The Lotus Treatise calls it 'having regressed, again generating great bodhi-mind.' Due to Śāriputra and others all having previously sought the great but regressed to cultivate small fruit, it is called 'regression and renewed generation.'" What does this mean? Answer: This clarifies why the Compendium Treatise calls it undetermined seed-nature while the Lotus Treatise calls it people who have regressed and again generated. It reconciles names that differ but meanings that are the same. However, the meanings also have slight differences, as will be reconciled below.

Question: The treatise states: "Not all undetermined-nature people have minds of regression and renewed generation. Therefore this should be called undetermined seed-nature." What does this mean? Answer: This explains why the Compendium Treatise calls it undetermined-nature while the Lotus Treatise calls it regression and renewed generation - though their meanings are the same, there are also slight differences, clarifying that one should follow the Compendium Treatise's terminology.

Question: How are there slight differences? Answer: Undetermined-nature means originally having three-vehicle seed-natures in the body. Some initially generate great mind and cultivate bodhisattva practices, but encounter regressive conditions and regress, then later again due to the power of Buddha's attraction and gathering, also generate great bodhi-mind. These are called undetermined-nature and also called those who have regressed and again generated. Some have not generated great mind and only cultivate small-vehicle practices, but due to what seed-nature determines, encountering conditions like Buddha, consequently generate great mind. These are called undetermined seed-nature but not called those who have regressed and again generated. This is called having slight differences. Therefore the Xuanzan's upper text states: "Not all undetermined-nature are regression types. There are also those who in past days had not sought the great, but now merely proceed from small fruit to great undetermined-nature."

Question: Among the two types of undetermined nature, which type does this first cause attract and gather? Answer: Some say: "This first cause is specifically for those who have regressed and again generated."

Now I consider this incorrect. Because there is no separate cause, it is generally for both types.

Question: The treatise states: "Second, to sustain the remaining undetermined seed-nature ground-stage bodhisattvas before the sixth abiding. Still being in regressive positions, fearing they might be diligent in Mahāyāna yet deteriorate and regress to depend on two vehicles for parinirvāṇa." What does this mean? Answer: This explains the second cause. The Compendium Treatise states: "Wishing to sustain the remaining undetermined seed-nature bodhisattvas who fear deteriorating in diligence regarding Mahāyāna, therefore teaching One Vehicle to sustain and make them abide, lest those bodhisattvas depend on the śrāvaka vehicle for parinirvāṇa."

Question: Previously it spoke of "attraction and gathering," now it speaks of "sustaining" - what difference is there? Answer: The Water Commentary states: "Attraction and gathering makes them enter and come into Mahāyāna; sustaining does not let them go away to the two vehicles."

Question: Why is before the sixth abiding called the regressive position? Answer: Among the ten abidings, the seventh is called non-regressive position. They no longer regress and fall to the two-vehicle ground. Before the sixth right-mind abiding, there is the principle of regressing and falling to the two-vehicle ground, therefore it is called regressive position. The so-called case of Śāriputra who for sixty kalpas cultivated Mahāyāna practices, encountered the eye-begging brahmin, and due to abandoning his eye regressed and entered the two vehicles - all such cases regress from the sixth abiding. Pure-Cause Deva-son, Dharma-Wealth Prince, and others are also like this.

Side discussion. Question: Are there undetermined seed-nature people who do not achieve Buddhahood? Answer: There should be such cases. Question: Which ones? Answer: Undetermined seed-nature has four types: First, people who have śrāvaka-bodhisattva nature. Second, people who have pratyekabuddha-bodhisattva nature. Third, people who have śrāvaka-pratyekabuddha-bodhisattva nature. Fourth, people who have śrāvaka-pratyekabuddha nature. Among these four types, the first three types necessarily achieve Buddhahood. The fourth person does not achieve

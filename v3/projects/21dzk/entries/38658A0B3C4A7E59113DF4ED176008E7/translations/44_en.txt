Since consciousness already does not exist, there is no consciousness to maintain seeds, and that body-cognition is completely exhausted. With what would one cultivate? Who would attain bodhi? After entering remainderless nirvāṇa, if there were good roots, this would not only violate the teachings but also violate correct principle. If body-cognition already exists, how could it be called remainderless nirvāṇa? This is not the same as the Tathāgata's having uncontaminated dependence being called "nirvāṇa with remainder" and having contaminated dependence exhausted being called "remainderless dependence," etc." (The text is extremely extensive; this is only a brief excerpt). In the above refutation, we have briefly explained it according to the Yogācāra Commentary. With this Profound Eulogy text, one can study them together.

Question: The treatise states: "Ten, because of ultimate completion. Since beyond this there is no other superior vehicle, depending on ultimate principle, it is most excellent. Therefore it is explained as One." What does this mean? Answer: This explains the tenth cause. The Mahāyāna-saṃgraha states: "Because it depends on ultimate principle, the One Vehicle is taught. It is not that there are no distinctions in the uncontaminated. Since beyond this there is no other superior vehicle, only this One Vehicle is most excellent, therefore Buddha teaches the One Vehicle." The Water Commentary states: "Ultimate means final meaning. It particularly raises up suchness. This is most excellent among all conditioned phenomena. Buddha's intention is that since suchness exists within all sentient beings' bodies and is most excellent, therefore the One Vehicle is taught." Up to the Nirvāṇa Sūtra: "If there were one dharma surpassing nirvāṇa, I would also explain it as dreamlike and illusory. This One Vehicle is also like this. This vehicle is subtle and wonderful, pure and foremost, unsurpassed among all worlds."

Question: What kind of principle is this "ultimate principle"? Answer: Principle means true principle, and also correct principle.

Question: If principle means true principle, what difference does it have from the previous dharma-selflessness, etc.? Since they are equally true principles. Answer: Lufu states: "Previously it discussed all sentient beings' suchness being equally shared with Buddha; this raises up what is excellent within sentient beings' bodies, not comparing with what is inferior."

Question: Since the One Vehicle is taught through these ten causes above, does the target audience also include those of determined nature? Answer: Dharma-selflessness, liberation, etc., since they are explanations of the One Vehicle through the first aspiration and ultimate cause within the second aspiration among causes, they penetrate to people of determined nature and cause them to be recipients. The others are not like this.

Question: How do we know it also penetrates to determined nature? Answer: The Profound Eulogy states: "If we follow the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha, the One Vehicle is taught through ten meanings. The meaning encompasses being for the Three [Vehicles], and there is no error in principle. Those of determined seed-nature do not act foolishly regarding dharma, those of indeterminate seed-nature turn around seeking the Great [Vehicle]." Now, making selective assignments among the ten causes is judged by investigating the meaning. One can naturally understand it all.

Question: If so, were there people of determined nature at the Lotus assembly? Answer: The Doctrinal Decisions states: "At the time of the Lotus assembly, the four types of śrāvakas were all initially present at the assembly. After the three departures, the conceited left their seats. It does not say that true sages also left their seats. Therefore, hearing the sūtra causes them to become non-foolish regarding dharma. Therefore, when the commentary explains prophecy, it does not give prophecy but does not obstruct being seated. Or there might be no determined nature. The commentary states: 'Because there is fear of harm, because prophecy is not given, because faculties are immature, they are not seated.'" Ancient worthies state: "Regarding determined nature there are two types: first, those with mature faith-faculties; second, those with immature faith-faculties. Those who are mature are present at the assembly because they are non-foolish regarding dharma. Those who are immature are not at the assembly because they might lose their own vehicle, like being harmed with fear." Now I privately think: when the three cycles formally teach the One Vehicle, they are not present at the assembly seats because there might be fear of damaging their own path. When the circulation section teaches the One Vehicle incidentally, they can be present at the assembly because they gain benefit and do not act foolishly regarding dharma. Therefore the Profound Eulogy states: "If the One Vehicle is taken as the doctrine, it only covers those who possess bodhisattva-nature and does not cover those with only śrāvaka-nature. One rain moistens three grasses separately, and can cover śrāvakas. The Yogācāra, etc. states: 'The uninterrupted path can distance dust, the liberation path

can separate from defilement. Realizing this superior wisdom is called pure dharma-eye. This is precisely seeing truth, stream-entry fruit, etc.'" (This explains the text in the Wonderfully Adorned King chapter about "eighty-four thousand [beings] distancing dust and separating from defilement, etc."). Therefore one should know: even where the One Vehicle is not being taught, it also covers śrāvakas. Since this already exists in the sūtra assembly, this explanation is made." Also, the Various Vehicles chapter states: "Generally speaking of śrāvakas, though there are four types, at the initial time of the Lotus there are three śrāvakas, only excluding those seeking cessation. Those with conceit, after arising and departing, then receive prophecy."

Question: The people who attained pure dharma-eye in the Wonderfully Adorned King chapter - did cessation-seeking ordinary people hear that chapter and initially attain their own vehicle's first fruit, etc.? If there were none who originally attained determined nature sage-fruits present at this assembly seat obtaining non-foolish dharma benefits? Answer: In the main doctrine section there are no such types. Upon reaching the circulation section there can be such types.

Question: The treatise states: "In this present assembly, according to the commentary, prophecy is given to only two people: first, indeterminate nature; second, transformed ones. For indeterminate nature: the first, second, and a small portion of the eighth. For transformed ones: the ninth meaning and other small portions. Teaching the One Vehicle does not completely reject and deny determined nature and no-nature. Therefore this One Vehicle is taught with hidden intention." What does this mean? Answer: Above we finished explaining the ten causes by which the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha teaches the One Vehicle. Using those ten causes to allocate and explain this sūtra's One Vehicle meaning, this concludes and establishes this sūtra's intention. The Water Commentary states: "This commentary corresponds to three complete ones and one partial one among the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha's ten. The three complete ones are: first, second, and ninth - transformation. The one partial is a small portion of the eighth. That is, within the eighth, taking śrāvakas and excluding those bodhisattvas of the same name."

Question: The sixth, nature-differences, already possesses the three vehicle seed-natures and is precisely indeterminate. Why is it not included? Answer: The Mahāyāna-saṃgraha Commentary states: "Because it is based on giving prophecy, therefore it is not taken."

Question: If so, shouldn't the second also not be taken? Because this assembly does not teach bodhisattva prophecy. Answer: The Mahāyāna-saṃgraha Commentary states: "There are two types of indeterminate: first, those who have already practiced Great Vehicle practices but wish to retreat from them; second, those who possess Great Vehicle nature, etc., but have never practiced the Great [Vehicle]. The first is the second [cause], the latter is the sixth [cause]. The Lotus Sūtra's fundamental intention is for the second [type], therefore the sixth is excluded. Thus the sūtra states: 'Śrāvakas and bodhisattvas hearing my dharma teaching will become Buddha without doubt.' Bodhisattvas are precisely this second indeterminate type. Discussion: Even if the sixth were taken, there should be no error. If based on clearly giving separate prophecies, why not exclude the second among the ten? If depending on the meaning of general characteristics and further giving prophecy, the sixth should be included. Based on this principle: among the ten, each one correspondingly takes indeterminate nature. Transformed ones according to what is appropriate also follow this meaning. The commentary only taking the first, second, and eighth is because the others, regarding separate meanings, clarify the One Vehicle and are not all indeterminate. Therefore they are not taken. It is not necessarily limited to only the first, second, and eighth."

Question: The next text in the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha Commentary states: "Question: The Dharma Garden Vehicle Chapter only takes the first, which differs from this. Why the discrepancy? Answer: That one is based on the commentary's words being for two śrāvakas, not teaching bodhisattvas. Therefore it does not take [others]. This one depends on bodhisattva-nature being indeterminate. Therefore it takes it." What is the meaning of this question and answer? Answer: Now examining the Various Vehicles chapter: "In the Lotus Commentary, among the four types of śrāvakas, prophecy is given only to indeterminate and transformed ones. Indeterminate seed-nature is precisely the first and second among the ten, plus a small portion of the eighth. Transformed ones are precisely the ninth. The remaining six types, through separate meanings in small portions, teach the One Vehicle, but are not all indeterminate and transformed ones. Nor is it that no-nature becoming Buddha is called One." Yet now the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha Commentary has [a view of] only taking the first

The Water Commentary states: "There has never been abandoning the One Vehicle outside the four vehicles to take the definitive fruits among the remaining four vehicles."

Question: The treatise states: "Also it is not breaking five. Making them cling to the indeterminate vehicle is the same as clinging to three." What does this mean?

Answer: This is the second successive refutation. Among the ancient masters' doctrines, there may also be the doctrine of teaching one to break attachment to the five vehicles as ultimate. Therefore it also successively refutes this.

Question: Then what is the meaning of this refutation?

Answer: The intention of this sūtra in teaching the One Vehicle is also not to break attachment to the five vehicles taught in the Laṅkāvatāra and other sūtras as ultimate in order to teach the One Vehicle. Why is this? Among the five vehicles there are those of indeterminate vehicle nature—namely, those whose three-vehicle nature is indeterminate. Within these people's bodies are the spiritual capacities of the three vehicles. If they cling to the two vehicles as ultimate, breaking this is as before. If they cling to the Mahāyāna as ultimate, this is not what should be broken. Therefore it says "making them cling to the indeterminate vehicle is the same as clinging to three." Regarding human and heavenly vehicles, it is as explained in the previous refutation. Therefore one cannot say that one is taught to break attachment to the five as ultimate.

The Water Commentary states: "If clinging to the two vehicles among the five as ultimate, it is no different from breaking two to return to one. If clinging to Mahāyāna, it is no different from the fault of breaking three. If clinging to human and heavenly vehicles, it is also the same as the previous refutation's meaning. Also, if generating śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha minds and cultivating śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha practices, this breaks the previous two-vehicle attachments. If generating Mahāyāna mind, it does not transgress the great. Why would it need to be broken? Speaking according to reality, both break attachment to the two vehicles and do not break the great."

Question: What are those five vehicles?

Answer: Regarding the five vehicles there are two explanations. One says: śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and buddha vehicles make three; the fourth is human vehicle; the fifth is heavenly vehicle. Two says: the three vehicles are as before; the fourth is indeterminate

vehicle (also called various-seed vehicle); the fifth is human-heavenly vehicle. What the current treatise quotes is the latter explanation.

Question: The treatise states: "Therefore the Śrīmālā only says 'arhats and pratyekabuddhas have fear; saying they attain the four wisdoms and nirvāṇa is the Buddha's expedient.'" What does this mean?

Answer: Having finished refuting other masters above, now to establish one's own doctrine, testimonial passages are quoted. Therefore it says "therefore." There are five quoted testimonies; this is the first testimony.

Question: How does this passage establish one's own doctrine?

Answer: Since it only says "arhats and pratyekabuddhas have fear" etc. and does not include bodhisattvas, it is clearly known that two are broken but not three.

Question: The treatise states: "This sūtra also says 'Only this one reality exists; the other two are not true.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the second testimony.

Question: What does it testify to?

Answer: Since it says "the other two are not true" and does not say "the other three," it is clearly known that only two are broken and three are not broken.

Question: The treatise states: "Secretly dispatching two people." What does this mean?

Answer: The third testimony.

Question: How does it testify?

Answer: This passage is from the poor son parable in the Chapter on Faith and Understanding, where the father wishes to entice and guide his son. The complete text states: "At that time the elder, wishing to entice and guide his son, devised expedient means and secretly dispatched two people of haggard appearance without威德." The Profound Praise states: "There are actually no two essences. Even if there are two-vehicle teachings, therefore it says 'secretly dispatched.' The expedient teaching only transforms the two vehicles, therefore it says 'two people.' Limited wisdom is called 'haggard appearance'; spiritual powers not being great is called 'without威德.'" Since two-vehicle teaching is called "two people," if bodhisattvas were added it should say "three people." Therefore it is known that two are broken but not three.

Question: The treatise states: "At the resting place two are taught." What does this mean?

【Left Page】

Answer: This is the fourth testimony.

Question: How does this testify?

Answer: This is from the verse at the end of the Phantom City Parable chapter. The complete text states: "Through the Buddhas' expedient power, they distinguish and teach three vehicles. There is only one Buddha Vehicle; for the sake of a resting place, two are taught." This is the same as the prose passage saying "for the sake of stopping and resting, two nirvāṇas are taught." The Profound Praise states: "What the two spiritual capacities study and what the two wisdoms realize are called two nirvāṇas." Since what the two vehicles realize is called two nirvāṇas and compared to phantom cities, it is clearly known that two are broken but not three.

Question: The ancient masters reconcile this saying: "The two nirvāṇas with remainder and without remainder are called two nirvāṇas, not because they are what the two vehicles realize." How should this be refuted?

Answer: The Profound Praise states: "It does not speak of with remainder and without remainder as two." The meaning is: if the two vehicles enter nirvāṇa without remainder, with body reduced to ash and consciousness extinguished, body and consciousness completely exhausted, and mental formations never arising again, how can one speak of "turning mind toward the great, abandoning the phantom city to reach the treasure place"? Therefore the ancient masters' doctrine has the fault of contradicting the sacred teachings.

Question: The ancient masters object: "If so, why does the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra say 'Mahāmati Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha saying: "World-Honored One, how do you say śrāvakas attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi?" The Buddha told Mahāmati: "This is spoken for those in nirvāṇa without remainder"'? Also the Treatise on Great Wisdom states: 'Severing the karma and afflictions of the three realms, entering nirvāṇa without remainder, yet being born in pure lands and hearing the Lotus Sūtra.' From this we see there are no two vehicles that ultimately do not become Buddha. Though dwelling in nirvāṇa without remainder, they eventually turn their minds toward the great and become Buddha. The Yogācāra and others speak of only dwelling in nirvāṇa with remainder, explaining according to what is near and easy to know. Why say those who enter the without-remainder completely do not turn their minds?" How should this be reconciled?

Answer: As the Yogācāra explains, the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra passage expeditiously shows entering dependence without remainder, provisionally speaking of such people as those who enter the without-remainder. In reality these are śrāvakas who turn toward bodhi, dwelling in nirvāṇa with remainder, intoxicated by samādhi wine. These are people of indeterminate nature dwelling in quiescent concentration who later emerge from concentration and advance toward Mahāyāna, becoming transformation bodies. The Treatise on Great Wisdom passage refers to receiving transformation recompense, going back and forth to transformation lands, and hearing the Lotus Sūtra—taking going as birth, but this is not actual rebirth. Therefore there is no contradiction.

Question: The treatise states: "Sheep and deer are not real; it does not speak of three." What does this meaning?

Answer: This is the fifth testimony.

Question: How does this passage testify?

Answer: Regarding the two carts of sheep and deer explained in the Parable chapter, the treatise commentary states: "The first person demonstrates various good roots, samādhi, and merits in the world, expeditiously making them rejoice, then afterwards making them enter great nirvāṇa." That "expeditiously making them rejoice" explains the reason why the two carts of sheep and deer have names but no substance. Therefore it says "sheep and deer are not real." If three were broken, it should say "the ox cart is also not a real cart." But it only says "two carts" and does not say "three carts." It is clearly known that two are broken but not three. Therefore it successfully establishes testimony. However, the phrase "does not speak of three" runs through the above four other testimonial passages. Since this is now the concluding place, it appears under the fifth testimony. Students should examine this.

Question: The treatise states: "Counting from superior to inferior: buddha vehicle is first, solitary enlightenment second, śrāvaka third. There being no second solitary enlightenment and no third śrāvaka does not mean there is no ultimate essence of Mahāyāna among the three vehicles. Examining the Sanskrit original, it says 'there is no second and third.' The present translation is abbreviated, therefore it says 'there is no two and also no three.'" What does this mean?

Answer: Having finished quoting testimony to establish one's own doctrine above, this now strikes back at the ancient masters' confusion to make them believe and understand. The ancient masters do not understand that the three vehicles from superior to

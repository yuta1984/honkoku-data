It is not called "generation" because it generates dharmas. Since it is eternally abiding and unchanging, it has no seed-nature. However, it exists together with all dharmas as their support, and has the meaning of causing dharmas to arise from the seeds of dharmas. Just as the great earth enables the growth of plants and trees. Therefore it is said to have the meaning of generation. Ancient masters said "True Suchness becomes the seeds of all dharmas," but this is more absurd than the babbling of infants. (This creates difficulty with the Yogācāra text stating "seeds conditioned by True Suchness." This should be explained through reconciliation as in the Huiri Treatise, etc.)

Question: If so, does the Lotus have only the meaning of inclusion and lack the meaning of generation? Answer: It does have it. Therefore, the Xuanzan's commentary on the passage about the five perfections and conferring prediction in the Chapter on the Merits of Rejoicing states: "Although this sutra explains the generation One Vehicle, its essential nature is broad and complete." The Water Commentary states: "'Although' has the meaning of uncertainty. The intention is: this sutra is mostly inclusion, being conditioned wisdom. A small portion encompasses the generation of unconditioned principle. It is properly called the inclusion conditioned vehicle, and subsidiarily called the generation unconditioned vehicle. Moreover, this sutra encompasses both principle and wisdom, with its essential nature being broad in scope." The Comprehensive Commentary states: "The commentary often says 'this sutra only explains generation,' but the character 'only' is erroneous and should be 'although'." From these passages, it is clearly known that both this sutra and those sutras explain inclusion and generation, yet their meanings have primary and subsidiary aspects, with hiddenness and manifestness in various places. That is, this chapter and the Vehicle Chapter, in explaining this sutra's One Vehicle, manifest the primary and conceal the subsidiary, saying "this is only inclusion." In explaining the Śrīmālā One Vehicle, they explain both primary and subsidiary together, saying "that encompasses generation." In the Chapter on the Merits of Rejoicing below, it says "although this sutra explains generation" and "although those sutras encompass inclusion," all expressing the presence of subsidiary meanings, with each taking only the primary meaning. (This has been generally explained in the above section on concealing the inferior and following the superior essence.)

Question: The Vehicle Chapter says "this sutra has narrow essence and function," while the Chapter on Distinctions below says "this sutra has broad essential nature." Why do they contradict? Answer: The intention of the Vehicle Chapter is to properly clarify the meaning of inclusion. This focuses on wisdom

[Lower Section]

without incorporating true principle. Regarding this meaning, it says "narrow essence and function." The intention of the lower passage is to subsidiarily clarify the meaning of generation. This encompasses true principle. Regarding this meaning, it says "broad essential nature." Therefore they do not contradict.

Question: Someone says: "This sutra also encompasses generation. The sutra states 'expediently distinguishing and explaining three within the One Vehicle path'—this is generation. Also in the Medicinal Herbs Parable chapter, one rain universally nourishes, but the three herbs and two trees grow differently—this is also generation." How is this interpretation? Answer: The Water Commentary states: "These are all inclusion, not generation. Dividing the three vehicles within the One Vehicle path was originally directed toward the capacities of the previous forty years. When the Mahāyāna capacity later matures, all converge into the Mahāyāna with no separate essence. In the Medicinal Herbs Parable chapter, the heavenly rain represents the one assembly's teaching. The different growth of three herbs and two trees subsidiarily refutes the illness of sudden-enlightenment bodhisattvas—this too is inclusion, not generation."

Question: The chapter states "this encompasses only those with Buddha-nature, that encompasses also those without Buddha-nature." What does this mean? Answer: This is the third contrast of those with and without Buddha-nature to reveal differences. The Vehicle Chapter states: "Moreover, the Lotus One Vehicle only discusses those with Buddha-nature as its basis, therefore it is expedient. The Śrīmālā One Vehicle also discusses those without Buddha-nature as its basis, therefore it is true and real." The Shanzhu Record states: "In the Lotus Sutra, the four great śrāvakas and others who received predictions all possess Buddha-nature. In the three rounds of One Vehicle [teaching], there is no text of those of determined non-Buddha-nature or those without Buddha-nature receiving predictions. In the Śrīmālā Sutra, citing four analogies, one interpretation has the ocean represent icchantikas. Birth and death are inexhaustible. Therefore that sutra speaks of 'unlearned, non-Dharma sentient beings.'"

Question: Why does this sutra encompass only those with Buddha-nature while that sutra encompasses also those without Buddha-nature? Answer: This sutra encompasses only those of determined Mahāyāna nature, determined śrāvaka nature, and undetermined nature, but does not encompass those without Buddha-nature. Therefore it says "only those with Buddha-nature." That sutra explains the four

[Left Page]

vehicles, therefore it also encompasses those without Buddha-nature. Hence it says "encompasses those without Buddha-nature."

Question: Why doesn't this sutra encompass those without Buddha-nature? Answer: The purpose of this sutra is to clarify the principle of undetermined two-vehicle practitioners attaining Buddhahood. However, those of determined two-vehicle nature, in the circulation section, receive subsidiary benefit and come to believe and understand the existence of Mahāyāna, becoming non-foolish Dharma persons. Sentient beings without Buddha-nature have the most inferior nature and cannot understand supramundane Dharma. If one were to explain it for them, they would generate further delusion. They are not recipients of the One Vehicle. Therefore they are not encompassed.

Question: If so, the Śrīmālā is also thus. Why explain the One Vehicle for non-recipients? Answer: This sutra mostly bases itself on active Buddha-nature to explain the One Vehicle. Therefore it excludes those without Buddha-nature. That sutra mostly bases itself on principle Buddha-nature to explain the One Vehicle. Therefore it encompasses those without Buddha-nature.

Question: If so, why does the Medicinal Herbs Parable chapter have text encompassing those without Buddha-nature? Namely, the small herbs among the three herbs. Therefore the Xuanzan states: "Small herbs are those without seed-nature who can be born in human and heavenly [realms]. Like dry earth being universally moistened, they lack supramundane seeds." Answer: The intention of the cloud and rain analogy is not merely to clarify the teaching of this one Lotus assembly. To refute the arrogance of a certain type of bodhisattva who claim "there are no separate two vehicles, only the One Vehicle," it explains that although Buddha's teaching is one, the benefits gained by the three vehicles and five natures differ, making them know there are various vehicles. This generally clarifies the behavioral characteristics of the recipients of the teachings explained throughout one [Buddha's] lifetime, the same as the Śrīmālā, Laṅkāvatāra and others explaining four vehicles, five vehicles, etc. Therefore it explains the existence of recipients without Buddha-nature, but this does not mean there are recipients without Buddha-nature in this Lotus assembly seat. Therefore there is no contradiction. (The Nirvāṇa Sutra states: "Those who speak of attaining Buddhahood and those who speak of not attaining Buddhahood both do not understand my meaning"—this clarifies those with and without Buddha-nature, and is also the same as this chapter.)

Question: The chapter states "this encompasses only the undetermined, that encompasses also the determined." What does this mean? Answer: This is the fourth contrast of determined and undetermined natures to clarify differences. The Vehicle Chapter states: "Moreover, the Lotus

[Lower Section]

only discusses the undetermined nature. Therefore it is expedient. The Śrīmālā also discusses the determined seed-nature. Therefore it is true and real. Because it is suitable to hear within one assembly."

Question: This sutra also encompasses determined śrāvakas, so why say "this encompasses only the undetermined"? Answer: This is stated based on the primary recipients who received predictions. Encompassing determined people is subsidiary recipients, therefore it is concealed and not discussed.

Question: What does it mean to say "that sutra encompasses the determined"? Answer: Because the Śrīmālā explains four vehicles, and the Nirvāṇa explains that all possess Buddha-nature.

Question: The chapter states "this mostly explains teaching and principle, that mostly explains practice and fruit." What does this mean? Answer: This is the fifth contrast of teaching-principle and practice-fruit to clarify differences. (The Vehicle Chapter lacks this contrast.)

Question: Why is it that when contrasting the Lotus with the Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, the Lotus mostly explains practice and fruit while that sutra mostly explains teaching and principle, but now when contrasting the Lotus with the Śrīmālā, it says the Lotus mostly explains teaching and principle while the Śrīmālā mostly explains practice and fruit? Answer: The Water Commentary states: "If this Lotus Sutra is contrasted with the Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, then the Lotus Sutra mostly explains self-benefit practice and fruit, called 'lotus.' The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, being explained for determined sudden-enlightenment bodhisattvas, mostly takes teaching and principle to understand 'lotus.' Now when contrasting this sutra with the Śrīmālā: this Lotus Sutra reveals 'formerly expedient, now real.' Therefore it mostly explains teaching and principle. The Śrīmālā does not discuss expedient and real. Both are for determined bodhisattvas, mostly explaining practice and fruit. Moreover, the former Lotus manifestly unifies teaching and principle, secretly unifies practice and fruit. The Śrīmālā manifestly unifies practice and fruit, secretly unifies teaching and principle." This meaning was explained through manifest-hidden contrast in the previous section on distinctions of unification. It can be known as in that place.

Question: The chapter states "this explains the One Vehicle as real and the two vehicles as expedient. That explains the One Vehicle as expedient and the four vehicles as real. Therefore the Śrīmālā states:"

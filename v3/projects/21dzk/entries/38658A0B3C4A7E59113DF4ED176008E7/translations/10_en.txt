The dharma-body is precisely what shows Buddha's knowledge and vision. Therefore the treatise explains: "The three vehicles are equal because Buddha-nature dharma-body has no distinctions." Liberation is precisely awakening to knowledge and vision. When both obstructions perish and both deaths are exhausted, this is true liberation. The two vehicles only attain the exhaustion and extinction of one obstruction and one death, with nothing remaining, and do not know this. Therefore the treatise states: "The two vehicles do not know the true reality." Thus they are caused to attain awakening.

The above three matters are precisely realizing entry into great parinirvāṇa. This necessarily has a cause. The meaning of "entering" is further explained. Therefore "entering" is taught—manifesting the granting of the karma of the non-regression stage and immeasurable wisdom. Buddha's appearing in the world is because he wishes to cause sentient beings of the three vehicles to all cultivate the karma of the non-regression stage, abide peacefully in the secret treasury, and enter great nirvāṇa, not for anything else.

These above three explanations only take the wisdom that is taught and call it the One Vehicle. The teaching gate that does the teaching is what the sūtra refers to above as "that gate of wisdom is difficult to understand and difficult to enter."

Question: Opening, showing, awakening, and entering are all called "knowledge and vision." What are the distinctions in this knowledge and vision?

Answer: Regarding the first explanation: the knowledge and vision of "opening" combines wisdom-nature and wisdom-characteristics to be called knowledge and vision. The knowledge and vision of "showing" calls wisdom-nature knowledge and vision. The knowledge and vision of "awakening" calls knowledge-characteristics knowledge and vision. The knowledge and vision of "entering" is the wisdom-nature and wisdom-characteristics of the causal stage. Regarding the second explanation: all four are wisdom-nature. Regarding the third explanation: the knowledge and vision of "opening" is wisdom-characteristics. The knowledge and vision of "showing" is wisdom-nature. The knowledge and vision of "awakening" is the principle of analytical cessation. The knowledge and vision of "entering" encompasses both nature and characteristics. This can be known by examining the text.

Question: The treatise states: "The Śrīmālā Sūtra also says: 'Just as taking as condition, contaminated karmic causes that continue later existence give birth to the three existences, so too with ignorance-ground as condition, through pure karmic causes, the three types of mind-made bodies of arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who have already attained sovereignty arise.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is the second evidence.

Question: How does this text serve as evidence?

Answer: The treatise next states: "Therefore the vehicle ridden by mind-made bodies is called the One of the causal stage." The meaning is that the three types of mind-made bodies exist within the ten stages, and the vehicle they ride is precisely the causal stage principle-wisdom One Vehicle. Therefore this text is cited as evidence for taking causal principle-wisdom as the One Vehicle essence.

Question: What is the meaning of this sūtra passage?

Answer: The Commentary on the Compendium states: "'Like' is demonstrative. Taking is precisely craving. When craving increases it is called taking, as the treatises explain. Taking has the meaning of attachment. It assists karma in producing birth, which is called condition. In reality all afflictions can moisten rebirth, but because the power of what is craved increases, it is specifically mentioned. Contaminated karmic causes refers to good and evil karma. Because they are together with contamination, they receive the name 'contaminated.' Because they personally produce their own fruits, they are established with the designation 'cause.' The names of existence in the three realms—their essence is conditioned and contaminated dharmas, namely the eighth consciousness serves as their essence. (The above is the analogy.)

Ignorance-ground is precisely the cognitive obstruction. Taking the grasping of sentient beings' bodhi as truly existent as condition, it assists karma to pull along transformational birth and death, which is called condition. Pure karma refers to subsequently-attained wisdom's discriminating karma. Because it directly produces birth and death, it is called cause. Arhats and others are people who receive the transformational. (This is precisely the dharma.)"

Question: Since taking is said to be increased craving, why does the Water Commentary say "Taking has two meanings: first, all-realm afflictions are called taking; second, increased craving is called taking. Now the first meaning is taken"?

Answer: The two masters each take one meaning. However, the Commentary on the Compendium's meaning is good. Therefore the Consciousness-Only Treatise states: "Although all afflictions can instigate and moisten, because what is craved increases moistening, this is called increased craving."

Question: Why are afflictions called conditions and karma called causes?

Answer: Karma arises depending on afflictions, and fruits are produced depending on karma. Therefore afflictions become

auxiliary conditions for birth and death, hence called conditions. Karma becomes the direct cause of birth and death, hence called cause.

Question: If karma is called cause, what difference does it have from name-and-form seeds?

Answer: The treatise states: "The essence of contaminated karma, through direct attraction and production, is called cause. It does not personally distinguish essence. What distinguishes essence is name-and-form seeds." The meaning is that good and evil karmic seeds cause distinctions in good and evil retribution, while name-and-form neutral seeds personally distinguish the essence of good and evil retribution.

Question: Why is ignorance-ground called the cognitive obstruction?

Answer: In that sūtra five grounds are explained: first is the ground of views and single place (three-realm discriminating afflictions); second is the ground of desire-craving (desire-realm innate afflictions); third is the ground of form-craving (form-realm innate afflictions); fourth is the ground of existence-craving (formless-realm innate afflictions); fifth is ignorance-ground (all cognitive obstructions). Although there are views, doubts, etc. within the cognitive obstructions, because ignorance predominates, they are comprehensively called ignorance.

Question: Why use those who are born in the three realms as analogy to manifest the three types of mind-made bodies?

Answer: Because the meanings are similar. The coarsest fruits of the desire realm are used to analogize arhat mind-made bodies. Form-realm fruits are next finest, analogizing pratyekabuddha mind-made bodies. Formless-realm fruits are finest, analogizing bodhisattva mind-made bodies.

Question: The treatise states: "In the Compendium of the Great Vehicle, myriad practices and true-suchness are both called Great Vehicle." What does this mean?

Answer: This is the third evidence. This is concluding text.

Question: How does this text serve as evidence?

Answer: In that treatise there is no specific text stating that myriad practices and true-suchness are both called Great Vehicle. The treatise master is simply taking the meaning of that treatise. Therefore in that treatise it states: "Depending on the Great Vehicle, all Buddha-bhagavats have ten characteristics of excellent speech." Within those ten excellences, myriad practices and true-suchness are contained, manifesting that the Great Vehicle is truly Buddha's

speech. Therefore this treatise's meaning is cited as evidence to establish the doctrine of taking causal and fruition principle-wisdom as the One Vehicle essence.

Question: What are those ten excellences?

Answer: First is the excellence of the basis of cognition (ālaya-consciousness); second is the excellence of the characteristics of cognition (the three natures); third is the excellence of entering the characteristics of cognition (realizing consciousness-only nature); fourth is the excellence of the causes and fruits of that entry (the six pāramitās cultivated in pre-stage and stage levels); fifth is the excellence of the cultivation distinctions of those causes and fruits (the ten bodhisattva stages); sixth is the excellence of enhanced morality (moral learning in the ten stages); seventh is the excellence of enhanced mind (mental learning in the ten stages); eighth is the excellence of enhanced wisdom (wisdom learning in the ten stages); ninth is the excellence of the cessation of those fruits (non-abiding nirvāṇa); tenth is the excellence of the wisdom of those fruits (the three Buddha-bodies).

Question: Among these ten, how are myriad practices and true-suchness distinguished?

Answer: Regarding the ten excellences, the practices that are cultivated are called myriad practices, and the principle that is manifested is called true-suchness. If definitively determined according to manifestation, then the perfected nature among the three natures of the second cognition-characteristics, the consciousness-only nature of the third entering cognition-characteristics, the principle of non-abiding nirvāṇa of the ninth cessation of fruits, and the dharma-body principle among the three bodies of the tenth wisdom of fruits are called true-suchness. All the rest are called myriad practices.

Question: What is the meaning of the sixth "essence of attractive supremacy"?

Answer: Taking the teaching that explicates and the principle that is explicated as the One Vehicle essence. This is the essence meaning. Therefore the treatise states: "Taking the two of explication and purport to be called the One Vehicle." That explication is teaching. Purport is principle.

Question: Why is this called the "essence of attractive supremacy"?

Answer: In teaching, transforming, attracting, and gathering sentient beings, nothing surpasses the two of teaching and principle. Therefore it is called "attractive supremacy." Also, because Buddha-fruition teaching and principle are taken as essence, it is called supreme. To distinguish from causal stage names, it is called supreme. Moreover, teaching is subtle and difficult to know, principle is deep and difficult to fathom. It is not like the coarse and shallow teaching and principle of the two vehicles.

Answer: True-suchness has one essence. Based on the differences manifested by the inherent nature's separation from delusion and suffering, four names are established. Therefore all are made the One Vehicle essence.

Question: In the meaning of "according-to-superior essence," superior dharmas are taken as the One Vehicle essence. However, inherently pure nirvāṇa is equally shared by all sentient beings, and in the position of being bound [by afflictions], its essence is inferior and is not a supreme dharma. Why make it the One Vehicle essence? Also, the two nirvāṇas of with-remainder and without-remainder are shared by the two vehicles and are also not supreme dharmas. Are these made the One Vehicle essence?

Answer: When gold is in sand, is it inferior to that made into a ring? Therefore this objection does not hold.

Question: The treatise states: "It also says: 'Practicing the six pāramitās for Ganges sand kalpas is not equal to someone listening, receiving, reading, and reciting, or even holding the sūtra scrolls. How much more so when someone explains it for others. This is because conditioned practices are compared to the unconditioned vehicle.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This cites the second proof. This is also text from the Śrīmālā Sūtra. The correct text states: "If good sons and good daughters practice bodhisattva conduct and perform the six pāramitās for Ganges sand kalpas, if good sons and good daughters listen, receive, read, recite, or even hold the sūtra scrolls, their merit exceeds the former. How much more so when they extensively explain it for people."

The meaning is: the One Vehicle explained in the Śrīmālā takes unconditioned principle as its essence. Therefore, using the merit of cultivating conditioned practices to compare superior and inferior, it says the merit of cultivating the six perfections is inferior, while the merit of upholding this sūtra is superior. Therefore this sūtra is cited as proof for taking the unconditioned as the One Vehicle essence.

Question: The treatise states: "The Nirvāṇa Sūtra says: 'The One Vehicle is precisely Buddha-nature.'" What does this text mean?

Answer: This cites the third proof. The meaning is: Buddha-nature is true-suchness principle, namely principle Buddha-nature. Therefore the text "One Vehicle is precisely Buddha-nature" is cited as proof that true-suchness is made the One Vehicle essence.

Question: There are two types regarding Buddha-nature, namely principle Buddha-nature and practice Buddha-nature. How do we know that what that sūtra explains is principle Buddha-nature?

Answer: That sūtra explains the doctrine that all sentient beings completely possess Buddha-nature. This is precisely calling in-bondage true-suchness "Buddha-nature." Therefore the Buddhabhūmi Commentary reconciles this, saying: "Although other sūtras proclaim that all types of sentient beings possess Buddha-nature and will all become buddhas, this refers to true-suchness Dharma-body Buddha-nature." The Yogācāra Treatise states: "In the Nirvāṇa Sūtra, manifesting the Dharma-body cause is mostly called Buddha-nature." Therefore we know that what that sūtra explains is principle Buddha-nature.

Question: The treatise states: "This destroys the phantom city and reaches the treasure land." What does this mean?

Answer: This cites the fourth proof. The meaning is: this Lotus Sūtra says "destroy the phantom city and reach the treasure land." The phantom city is the provisional nirvāṇa of the two vehicles. The treasure land is the great parinirvāṇa of Buddha-fruition, namely showing Buddha-knowledge and Buddha-vision. Therefore this text is cited as proof for taking true-suchness as the One Vehicle essence.

Question: The two-vehicle nirvāṇa compared to the phantom city is true-suchness principle. Is it made the essence of the "encompassing phenomena returning to principle" One Vehicle?

Answer: "Same" means equivalent meaning. It shows that Dharma-body nirvāṇa is the same for the three vehicles. Because nirvāṇa's essence has no duality, taking that can also be made the essence of the "encompassing phenomena returning to principle" One Vehicle.

Question: If nirvāṇa has no duality, one should not say "destroy the phantom city and reach the treasure land."

Answer: Two-vehicle people arouse wisdom of personal emptiness, sever afflictive obstacles, and realize the principle of personal emptiness. This is called two-vehicle nirvāṇa, which is provisional analytical cessation, therefore compared to a phantom city. However, they have not yet aroused wisdom of dharma emptiness to sever knowledge obstacles.

They have not realized dharma-emptiness principle and true great parinirvāṇa. Turning their minds toward the great, they abandon the two-vehicle path and enter the bodhisattva path—this is called "destroying the phantom city and reaching the treasure land." However, the personal-emptiness principle they previously realized is one aspect of great parinirvāṇa, so it is said that its essence has no duality.

Question: If so, must one necessarily take the two-vehicle nirvāṇa principle as the "encompassing phenomena returning to principle" essence?

Answer: Within the "according-to-superior essence," there is this meaning of encompassing phenomena returning to principle. Therefore, one correctly takes only the great parinirvāṇa principle of Buddha-fruition as this essence. The meaning of "destroying the phantom city and reaching the treasure land" is like this.

Question: The treatise states: "Only using true-suchness Dharma-body equality is it called the One Vehicle." What does this mean?

Answer: This is the conclusion. The meaning is: using the three types of teachings cited as proof, the "encompassing phenomena returning to principle" essence only uses true-suchness Dharma-body principle as the One Vehicle essence.

Question: What is the meaning of the second "gathering remainder returning to wisdom essence"?

Answer: Using only fruit-wisdom as the One Vehicle essence—this is the meaning of this essence. Therefore the treatise states: "Also using true wisdom, it is called the One Vehicle."

Question: If so, does this essence only take wisdom and not take principle?

Answer: The Water Commentary states: "Using unconditioned correct wisdom as the One Vehicle essence does not mean emptily taking only wisdom and not taking principle. In reality it also includes principle. Although the meaning is knowledge and vision, knowledge and vision know characteristics and nature. Just for returning to wisdom, wisdom is made the essence. However, wisdom does not arise alone; it depends on principle for generation. This is simply encompassing principle returning to wisdom." Restating the meaning: "remainder" refers to principle.

Question: What kind of wisdom is that wisdom?

Answer: The four wisdoms of Buddha-fruition: first, great perfect mirror wisdom; second, equality-nature wisdom; third, wonderful observation wisdom; fourth, accomplishing-activities wisdom.

Question: Among the eight consciousnesses, which consciousness is transformed to attain which wisdom?

Answer: The Yogācāra treatise states: "Transforming the defiled eighth, seventh, sixth, and fifth [consciousnesses], they are attained in that order."

Question: The treatise states: "The above text itself says 'expedient means and knowledge-vision are all already complete.'" What does this mean?

Answer: This is citing proof. There are two texts cited as proof; this is the first.

Question: What is the meaning of this text?

Answer: The sūtra's correct text states: "The Tathāgata's pāramitās of expedient means and knowledge-vision are all already complete." The Profound Commentary states: "Knowledge-vision refers to the essence of the two wisdoms of conventional and ultimate. Fundamental wisdom is called 'knowledge'; subsequently-attained wisdom is called 'vision.' Expedient means refers to the wonderful function of this wisdom—skillful expedient means. Because one accomplishes inconceivable realms oneself, one possesses knowledge-vision. Giving to voice-hearers and others is called expedient means. Pāramitā means reaching the other shore. It clarifies that because the Buddha accomplishes the two superior wisdom essences, he can accomplish inconceivable realms, has already reached the other shore, and surpasses all others. By possessing the wonderful functions of the two wisdoms that are expedient means, he can later enable others to reach the other shore. Therefore, he can use this inconceivable realm knowledge-vision and also give it to voice-hearers and bodhisattvas."

Question: How does the treatise text interpret this sūtra passage?

Answer: The Profound Commentary cites: "Again, various knowledge-visions means accomplishing inconceivable realms oneself and giving to voice-hearers and bodhisattvas. As the sūtra says, 'Śāriputra, the Tathāgata uses knowledge-vision and expedient means to reach the other shore.' Reaching the other shore means surpassing all other bodhisattvas."

Question: What is the meaning of this text?

Answer: The treatise quotes the sūtra with four phrases: expedient means, knowledge-vision, mindful observation, and verbal expression. Interpreting this text, the treatise has three meanings. The first...

Question: If so, what distinction exists between this sixth cause and the initial first cause? Answer: The Water Commentary states: "According to one interpretation, 'leading and gathering' refers to two-vehicle sages. 'Different natures' speaks about ordinary beings who possess two-vehicle natures." Master Myōsen and other ancient masters frequently employed this interpretation.

I now consider this incorrect. The texts of Asvabhāva and Vasubandhu's two treatises are clear. Why speak of ordinary beings? This fails to grasp the verse's meaning and pointlessly results in false statements. Regarding the initial first cause: because undetermined-nature two-vehicle practitioners also have Buddha-nature within their bodies, to lead and gather such people to enter the Buddha Vehicle, One Vehicle is taught through the meaning of leading and gathering. This takes leading and gathering as the cause. This sixth cause depends on undetermined-nature two-vehicle practitioners also having Buddha-nature within their bodies - because such people will eventually abandon two-vehicle seed-nature and can become Buddha, therefore One Vehicle is taught to reveal that their natures are not the same. This takes nature-difference as the cause. Therefore the first cause and this sixth cause differ in meaning. They should not be harmonized. Between sages and ordinary beings - this contradicts the verse's meaning and is not the original intent.

Question: If so, why does the Ornament Treatise state: "Speaking of leading undetermined three-vehicle people into Mahāyāna, therefore One Vehicle is taught"? Viewing this, when this sixth cause speaks about ordinary beings, it can differ from the first cause, but when speaking about those who have attained fruition, it does not differ from the first cause. How should this be reconciled? Answer: That Ornament Treatise text explains derivative meanings by extension. The meaning is: because natures are not the same, One Vehicle is taught. They will necessarily enter Mahāyāna. Therefore there is no contradiction. The Water Commentary text explains the meaning of different natures, but since its meaning differs profoundly, I do not record it.

Question: The treatise states: "Seventh, because Buddha attains the same intention as his own essence toward sentient beings, saying 'I am precisely that, and that is precisely me. Since I have already become Buddha, they too will become Buddha.'" What does this mean? Answer: This explains the seventh cause. This is precisely the first intention among attaining two intentions. The Compendium Treatise states: "First, all Buddhas attain intentions identical to their own essence toward all sentient beings, saying 'That is precisely me, and I am precisely that.' Through this causation, since this has already become Buddha, that too will become Buddha. Therefore this is called attaining the first intention."

Question: How is it called same-essence intention? Answer: The Water Commentary has three explanations. First: "Tathāgata teaches that the dharmakāya-nature within all sentient beings' bodies and the dharma-nature within my body have no two differences, being equally shared. My body and sentient beings' bodies are equal without distinction. Therefore One Vehicle is taught." Second: "Tathāgata's same-essence great compassion - compassionate mind being equal, lovingly mindful of all sentient beings, no different from myself." Third: "I, conditioning the four-wisdom bodhi seeds from the causal stage, generate dharmakāya manifestation and enable Buddha-attainment. Today I wish to enable all sentient beings to hear the Wonderful Lotus Sūtra and generate saṃbhogakāya manifestation, no different from myself."

Question: Among these three explanations, which is correct? Answer: The commentary itself summarizes: "One can merely say that Buddha, through compassionate mind, equally observes sentient beings as identical to himself. Therefore it is called same-essence." The first explanation is correct.

Question: The commentary's question states: "What has obstruction is form; what lacks obstruction is emptiness. Existence and non-existence differ; form and emptiness are completely different. That which makes same is Buddha; that which is made same is ordinary beings. Since ordinary and sage differ, why call it same-essence?" How does one answer? Answer: The following text states: "One who cuts thighs is the child; one who devours flesh is the parent. Though mother and child differ, emotionally they are one essence. Compassionate mind is Buddha; compassionate objects are sentient beings. Though mind and object differ, contemplatively they are one essence."

Question: The first explanation explains the causal essence through dharmakāya equality - this is most appropriate. Also the third explanation explains same-essence through bodhisattva seeds - this too is appropriate. Why not adopt these?

Answer: Within the commentary, the first explanation is criticized: "Buddha realizes suchness and does not see distinctions of saṃsāra, nirvāṇa, etc. Don't the two vehicles also not see saṃsāra, nirvāṇa, etc.? Because they uniformly despise saṃsāra and enjoy nirvāṇa." For the third explanation, no reason for criticism is stated. My private opinion differs slightly. Vasubandhu's treatise explains these two intentions: "First, gathering-equal intention. Through this, all sentient beings are gathered... Second, dharma-nature equal intention, etc." That gathering intention is Tathāgata's great compassionate mind. Therefore the second explanation is most superior.

Question: Why does Buddha attain intentions identical to his own essence toward all sentient beings, therefore teaching One Vehicle? Answer: When understanding "that is precisely me and I am precisely that," there are no distinctions of that and this. When understanding "I precisely become Buddha and they too become Buddha," there are no distinctions among various vehicles. Only One Buddha Vehicle exists. Therefore One Vehicle is taught.

Question: If so, does this same-essence intention extend to determined-nature two-vehicle and natureless sentient beings? Answer: What fault would there be if so? Question: Both have faults. If you say it extends to determined-nature and natureless beings, then saying "Since I have already become Buddha, they too will become Buddha" - how could determined-nature and natureless people not become Buddha? If Buddha-attainment is permitted, there would be great fault contradicting the doctrine. If you say it doesn't extend to determined-nature and natureless beings, then same-essence intention has the fault of being too narrow.

Answer: It extends to determined-nature and natureless people, employing same-essence intention. Tathāgata's great compassion does not discriminate - loving this one's Buddha-becoming, hating that one's non-Buddha-becoming. It does not select between having-nature and no-nature, determined-nature and undetermined-nature, but has intentions wishing all to become Buddha. However, determined-nature and natureless people, from beginningless natural law, have weak compassion, inferior seed-natures, and lack Buddha-nature. Therefore, though Tathāgata's great compassion broadly extends to them, they cannot become Buddha. Like sun and moon light universally illuminating, but covered vessels do not receive that light. This fault of covered vessels is not the sun-light's blame. As the Compendium Treatise states: "Day and night constantly six times observing all worlds, with great compassion corresponding to beneficial joy, I pay homage." This clarifies the virtue of Tathāgata's great compassionate intentions extending throughout everything. Also: "Though pervading the sentient realm, having obstructions while lacking causes - these two determinations do not turn Buddhas' sovereignty." This clarifies the reason for types not receiving Buddha's benefits.

Question: This seventh cause clarifies Buddha attaining intentions identical to his own essence toward sentient beings. If so, do sentient beings also attain intentions that their own bodies are same-essence with Buddha? Answer: Ancient masters' opinion is like this. Therefore the Water Commentary states: "The Lotus says 'mind-aspect essence-trust.' Buddha knows they will become Buddha, and they too know themselves. Therefore it is called same-essence intention." I now consider this incorrect. This meaning belongs to the next eighth cause. This seventh cause only clarifies Buddha's intentions. It is not like sentient beings' intentions. The two types of intentions are each separate. How can they be mixed in explanation?

However, in explaining these seven causes, the old Compendium Treatise and Ornament Treatise differ slightly. Since the present treatise master uses only Asvabhāva Bodhisattva's explanation, he does not further cite those other texts. Vasubandhu Bodhisattva's explanation is the same as Asvabhāva's. Master Ji's Vehicle Chapter cites Four Truths texts to harmonize and explain this.

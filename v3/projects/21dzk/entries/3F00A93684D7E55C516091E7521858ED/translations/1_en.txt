This is the one stage where wisdom, compassion, and dharma-nature mysteriously unite in non-identity and non-separation. This one stage simply exists in "dwelling nowhere while giving rise to that mind." Therefore, it ultimately returns to one, so to speak. If this enlightenment is not yet fulfilled, it is the causal stage. If this enlightenment is already fulfilled, it is the Buddha-fruit. The three-aspect nirvāṇa is exclusively based on the merit of the fruit stage. The compassionate vow of the icchantika originates from the causal stage. There is no dispute about this meaning. However, examining the ultimate principle in detail, the two stages mutually contain each other. The partial realization of Dharma Body, Prajñā, and Liberation are all present in the causal stage. How could they relate only to the fruit stage? The vow to exhaust the realm of beings and reach the limit of future time - how could this be only the virtue of the cause? Question: The icchantika vow exists only in great compassion. Why now trouble to speak of the mysterious union of the three dharmas? Answer: Limitless great compassion arises from suchness-wisdom. If wisdom has not yet realized suchness, how could self and other be eliminated? If self and other are not eliminated, how does supreme compassion arise? Therefore, explaining this vow: "Knowing that all dharmas are originally nirvāṇa, one does not abandon all sentient beings." Also, the Yogācāra treatise explains the wisdom of equality: "Great compassion and others are always mutually corresponding." One should understand by analogy. Question: If so, why say "compassion is conditioned by provisional existence"? Answer: Though the object of compassion exists, compassion's arising depends on emptiness. Objectless loving-kindness is the foundation of loving-kindness; formless great compassion is supreme among great compassion. This meaning is easy to understand. If discussing the ultimate, it exists in the stage of combined contemplation. Clearly know: this vow is the function and virtue of non-abiding nirvāṇa. Knowing this, this vow is the universal vow of all bodhisattvas. Question: If so, in the sacred teachings, does "icchantika bodhisattva" refer to the name of all bodhisattvas? Answer: Though all bodhisattvas have this vow, compassion-predominant bodhisattvas have this characteristic even more enhanced. Therefore, it is specially expressed - such as Avalokiteśvara, Mañjuśrī, and others. Because of saying this, it does not mean that wisdom-predominant ones lack this vow. That Śākyamuni has this vow is precisely the evidence. Question:

If so, do those of shallow stages now generate this great vow or not? Answer: If the stage is shallow, this vow follows the shallow; if the stage is deep, this vow follows the deep. Though shallow, it is not absent. Why would one not be able to be called a bodhisattva? Question: Do we ordinary beings with our limited spiritual aspiration also have this vow? Answer: Even with feeble and inferior partial observance, why would this be absent? This is precisely when one strives and exerts effort according to one's capacity and eliminates the attachment to self and other. If not so, it would be extremely difficult to generate. Considering this, constantly making one's own mind have no place of attachment - is this the essential point of the Buddha path? What is the self-mind? Utterly void and formless, neither color nor fragrance, without smoke or cold. Seeking and searching for its location, one also cannot obtain it. It is simply cognitive awareness arising in dependence on objects. That cognitive awareness is brilliantly clear like a bright mirror, with nothing it does not illuminate and nowhere it does not reach. How could one call it without substance? However, searching for its substance: karmic impressions serve as seeds, prior thoughts as conditions, various sense objects as realms, and sense faculties as support - arising according to circumstances and time. Since this is already the combination of various conditions, how could it have self-nature? Never seeing anything that has its own essential nature, only through dependence on other forces can it obtain arising. One thus knows: this dharma is originally without nature. However, this principle of nothingness is the nature of dependent origination. If not natureless, then not dependently originated. However, this dependent origination is the characteristic of naturelessness. If not dependently originated, then not natureless. One should know: it is birth because of no-birth, and also no-birth because of birth. Emptiness because of existence, existence because of emptiness. Truth because of the provisional, provisional because of truth. The provisional refers to all phenomena accomplished when various conditions accord with this principle. Those phenomena are like illusions - neither existent nor non-existent. This principle is inevitable, completely without doubt. Now, taking what thing and forming fixed thoughts? Because existing yet empty, and empty

yet existing, both yet neither, neither yet both - whatever one fixes upon is all false attachment. What remains to be retained as what the mind thinks of? Since there is nothing thought of, there is nothing obtained. Because there is nothing obtained, the self-mind is clear and bright, illuminating its own nature. Speaking of "self-illumination" does not mean thinking of the self and illuminating it. If one thinks, then one does not illuminate; if one does not think, then one illuminates. The wisdom of no-attainment is precisely bodhi. Like suspending a bright mirror in empty space - beyond self-nature there is nothing to illuminate. All these are discussions relative to others. Within the self-dharma, how could there be this instruction? However, now provisionally explaining to know what is beyond explanation - this is precisely the original intent of explanatory teaching. Those attached to teachings take no-attainment as attainment. Those who reject teachings take having attainment as no-attainment. Without relying on explanation, who could realize and know? Without rejecting explanation, who could realize and know? Except for those with past karmic connections who have wordless sudden enlightenment - in the present world of our country, such capacity is rare. Those without the power of teachings probably make many errors. Therefore, practitioners, I humbly pray: do not abandon teachings, do not grasp teachings.

Though not yet knowing or seeing, considering the tendency of things, is the original intent of Buddha-dharma perhaps like this? This should be carefully decided in consultation with experienced practitioners.

It should be contemplated carefully. 《There is another foolish speculation. As in records elsewhere. The present meaning is not the same as scholars one-sidedly establishing essence》

○The Three Levels of Implicit Meaning
Under explicit statements etc. carry two implicit meanings. 《This is the first level》. Distinguishing this as not being that. 《This is the second level》. This intended purpose finally governs the explicit statement. 《This is the third level》. For instance, in the consciousness-only inference, in the establisher's mind, one accepts and places under the word "form" the two distinctions of "definitely separate" and "not definitely separate." Distinguishing the general words, making them two categories. Therefore it is called distinction. Because it is permitted in the mind, it is called implicit meaning. 《First level》. These two categories of implicit meaning are mutually opposed, distinguishing this as not being that. Therefore it is called distinction. One permits the intention of taking this and rejecting that. Therefore it is called implicit meaning. Distinction has distinguisher and distinguished. Implicit meaning has intended and non-intended. 《Second level》. Among these two distinctions, taking one as the intended purpose. The general words relate to this implicit meaning. Though the expressing words extend to both, the mind distinguishes this, and because it belongs to the intended purpose, it is called distinction. In the mind one permits that the general explicit statement is this and not that. Therefore it is called implicit meaning. 《Third level》. It is like two people in one room mutually disputing over being its master. 《Like the two-category distinction》 A bystander judges this, distinguishing that this room's master is this person and not that one. 《This is like intended and non-intended》 Finally this person takes possession of this room. 《This is the metaphor of mind belonging to words》

○The Partial Distinction of Non-intended
First: It is meaning-contradiction. 《Though without separate essence, when establishing the intended thesis, it comes in opposition. The contradictory separate meaning becomes the non-intended distinction》

【Lower section】
Second: It is the dharma accepted by the adversary.
Third: It is the meaning on the positive example. 《Because the example-meaning pervades the predicate, it becomes non-intended. Its essence is not taken》
Fourth: Making the positive example the partial distinction.
　When examining the two distinctions, tentatively taking the positive example as non-intended. When properly creating the contradiction, that meaning transforms to become meaning on the subject. Therefore the partial distinction's essence also becomes positive example below. This is also one pattern.
Fifth: Taking one dharma from the positive example as partial distinction.
　Among the positive example having many dharmas, taking and dividing one as partial distinction. The remainder stays as all positive examples. In inferences where positive examples have many objects, all are thus.
Sixth: Reversing the previous. 《The positive example has many categories. Leaving one as positive example, making all the rest partial distinctions》
Seventh: In the positive example, what resembles the subject's essence-category becomes partial distinction. The rest are positive examples.
Eighth: The true standard must be meaning on the subject. Otherwise it is the seed of distinction-contradiction.
Ninth: There must be separate essence, but not necessarily meaning on the subject.

The above nine levels intermix ancient and contemporary meanings. Scholars' proposals probably do not go beyond these meaning-categories. One should still examine various schools' records and record different theories.

　　Creating Non-Conditional Nature of Existence
First: It is identical substantial existence. 《This also has two meanings. First: substantial existence accepted by the establisher. 《Sanshō》 Second: taking as essence the identical substantial existence established on the adversary's side. 《Myōsen》》
Second: The sameness-difference nature of positive examples.
Third: It is meaning-contradiction. 《Shimizu takes this》
Fourth: The existence-nature of the subject. If viewed from the establisher, it becomes creating conditional nature of existence. If viewed from the adversary, it is non-conditional nature of existence. 《Jōrō of Yakushiji》
Fifth: Separate meaning on existence-nature apart from substance. 《Matsumuro's oral instruction》
Sixth: Mutually accepted existence-nature. 《Kojima's commentary record》
Seventh: The five categories of substance etc. 《Shun'on》
　Dō says "substance etc." has no words for five categories. Shun'on says "the five categories of substance etc." Perhaps he mistakenly grasped Kojima's meaning. Shun'on's private record records five transmissions. The first four have the two-volume transmission. The fifth is Dō's meaning. Dō's meaning should be called three categories. Sameness-difference nature is positive example. Beyond that, taking the three categories of substance etc. as non-intended distinction.

　　The subject-distinctions of the third and fourth contradictions, the essences of creating non-existence nature and conditional nature of existence, can be known by analogy with this. The subject-distinction of the consciousness-only inference, the distinction of form definitely separate from eye-consciousness, has many transmissions. As in the Questions and Answers of the former bishop and the Jinshi Record.

【Lower section】
　Question: If the essence of creating non-conditional nature of existence is substance etc., it should not be examined and placed under existence-nature of the subject. Because it mutually distinguishes with the non-substantial predicate and is not separate.

　I say: This difficulty is most incorrect. Because all implicit meanings are necessarily examined in the thesis-bases of dharma and subject. If not so, the predicate of the consciousness-only inference already establishes "not separate from eye-consciousness." How could it carry the partial distinction of "form definitely separate from eye-consciousness" under the subject? Also, when establishing "sound's inflection is not expressing," the sound-sphere subject should not have the distinction of produced inflection. Because produced inflection is expressing names etc. Therefore one knows: it is examined in the established thesis-base, not considering the aspect of non-separation nature.
　　　　《The Jōwa edition's red margin note says: This question and answer should be contemplated》

　Question: The superior-inferior implicit meaning of dharma-distinction sees and examines the subject's eye etc. Otherwise, by what does one distinguish superior and inferior?
　Answer: Those two distinctions are examined under the predicate "for others' use." It is not seeing and combining the subject's eye etc. and placing superior-inferior words. Because that school accepts the meaning of true-superior and provisional-inferior. 《This matter should still be contemplated》

　Is non-intended necessarily meaning on the subject?
Not necessarily so. The dharma-distinctions of the third and fourth contradictions make sameness-difference combination the partial distinction. The non-intended implicit meaning of the great method's subject-distinction is substance etc. 《As before》. These all have their essence external to the subject. Generally, non-intended has three categories in total. As in the Clear Source. 《Above is one proposal》 Further saying: all distinction-contradictions take meaning on the subject as the two distinctions. Otherwise it is not the true standard.

Question: How about the third and fourth contradictions?
Answer: According to Kojima's meaning, making sameness-difference combination having

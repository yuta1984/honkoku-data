【Upper section】
Myōyōshō Volume 1 (Note: Both the Kōan and Ōō versions transmitted by Daijōin lack the character "volume" and internal titles. This is true for every volume. This follows the Jōwa version transmitted by Ichijōin)

　Contradictory Causes (sōi-in)
　Particular-universal opposition (masses' quantified disputes differ; doctrinal basis and doctrinal essence)
　Before-after opposition with shared characteristics
　Verbal permission opposition (doctrinal basis and doctrinal essence; capable of violating doctrinal intent)

　○ Contradictory Causes
(Chinkai - Note: The Kōan and Ōō versions have "Chinkai" in red characters)

Someone has pointed out four faults in the transmission of contradictory causes. First is the fault of making the standpoint extremely broad (Note: "broad" is written as "coarse" in variant texts [Kōan and Ōō versions]). Second is the fault of having many omissions. Third is the fault of violating the current text of the commentary. Fourth is the fault of not considering one's own errors.

　　The fault of extremely broad standpoint (Note: "broad" is written as "coarse" in the two versions) (Because one does not know how to make contradictory causes known, one does not know that causes obtain the name of effects [Note: Kōan version margin note states "Therefore, that brief commentary says one does not know how to make contradictions known" - contradictory, therefore causes - perhaps this is incorrect?])

The opponent establishes a capable-of-violating doctrine. Because the capable-of-violating harms the original doctrine, it is called "contradictory." It is like how the impermanent doctrine contradicts the permanent doctrine. That the impermanent doctrine can harm the permanent doctrine originates from the power of the cause. The cause of "being produced" establishes the impermanent doctrine and makes it contradict the permanent doctrine. Investigating this function of proof and attributing it to the cause, the cause also contradicts the permanent doctrine. This cause-theorist is not unaware of the cause's power to create contradiction. Who would call this extremely broad (Note: "broad" is written as "coarse" in the two versions)?

【Lower section】
　　The fault of having many omissions (Because while acknowledging that causes harm doctrinal positions, one does not establish names; because while seeing the blocking of analogical difficulties, one does not employ them)

Question: If a cause contradicts a doctrine, the cause should be able to obtain the name "contradictory" by itself. Why does one rely solely on dependent naming to establish the name of the effect?

Answer: Although the cause itself has contradictory meaning, it is not like two doctrines being mutually opposed. Therefore, in explaining names, one takes only doctrinal contradiction. Hence it is only dependent naming and does not combine qualitative naming.

Question: The commentary blocks analogical difficulties saying, "Through causes, doctrines are established and made mutually contradictory. Causes are named contradictory. It is not that doctrines establish causes and make causes contradictory. [Such causes] are not named contradictory." (Text [Note: "text" is written as "and so forth" in the two versions]) Since the commentary master has already blocked analogical difficulties, why, while seeing the clear text, does one still not dare to use it? Answer: This can be understood below.

　　The fault of violating the commentary's current text (Because it contradicts the text about harming doctrinal positions; because it confuses the questions and answers about causes overturning doctrines)

This cause-theorist also acknowledges that "capable of contradicting" is precisely the meaning of cause. How does this contradict the commentary text? Because causes can establish capable-of-violating doctrines, they can harm the originally established doctrine. Therefore it says, "The cause of proof harms doctrinal positions and establishes different categories. This is called contradictory." Questions about causes overturning doctrines arise from this. "Through causes doctrines are established and made mutually contradictory" and so forth dispels analogical difficulties. The meaning is: because causes make two doctrines mutually contradictory, there is contradictory meaning. Doctrines do not make causes mutually contradictory. How can one say that doctrines contradict causes? This blocks analogical difficulties that "capable of contradicting" is precisely doctrinal meaning, based on "capable of contradicting" being precisely the meaning of cause.

Question: Then why does the above text say "Therefore doctrines also do not contradict causes, making difficulties by analogy," criticizing Master Gui's immediate-cause meaning and showing that his position has doctrinal-causal analogical difficulties? Answer: That master says causes directly contradict doctrines. Therefore...

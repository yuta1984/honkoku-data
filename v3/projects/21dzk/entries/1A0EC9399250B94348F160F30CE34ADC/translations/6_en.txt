It is a Vaiśeṣika master. If exhausting reason, it is a Buddhist disciple. (Above summary) Now examining this tradition: "All formations are impermanent" is what Buddhist teaching explains. Vaiśeṣika's principle of created-impermanence is the same as this. However, since that master establishes sound-nature, he eventually commits faults, though the Sound theorist is dull and temporarily still does not commit faults. Therefore it is tentatively correct and temporarily becomes a correct cause. Nevertheless, he eventually commits contradictory determination and is not a truly correct cause. Buddhist dharma permanently has no faults. Therefore this is taken as the ultimate standard. The Nine Sentences Commentary text raises tentative correct causes (meaning). Second: Vaiśeṣika means Buddhist disciple. (etc.) This tradition's meaning is that Buddhist dharma is the most excellent theory among the ninety-six paths, therefore named Vaiśeṣika. Third: because the establishments are the same, it is called Vaiśeṣika from the beginning. (The latter two traditions are in Chūsai's private record) Among these three meanings, the first tradition is best. The third meaning also has deep intention and should receive oral transmission. The second is quite hard to believe.

The Abbreviated Essential Questions' dispute over sentences two and five
Regarding Buddhist disciple tradition, there are two meanings. Kojima takes the second sentence, Dōsen the fifth sentence. Both traditions accord with the Compilation. First following Kojima: the Compilation's question sees sentences two and four, with Sound and Vaiśeṣika masters already being establisher and opponent, so if the second sentence commits contradictory determination, why do the nine sentences lack contradictory determination (meaning)?

The answer's meaning: the fourth sentence speaks according to separate establisher-opponent, namely opposing Buddhist disciples. It is not the same as usual practice. How do we know? Because the fifth sentence's "audible" cause opposes Buddhist disciples (meaning).

Question: That record states: "In long-established determinations, Vaiśeṣika and Sound theory face each other as establisher-opponent. But in the Nyāyamukha verses, if the 'created' cause is not so, what meaning is this?" Outside the Nyāyamukha's nine sentences, what place

is indicated by "long-established"? If indicating the contradictory determination place, that is one place. This is also one place. By what is it called "long-established" and why not called "separate"? Answer: When external heretical logic masters demonstrate the second sentence, they mostly take Vaiśeṣika syllogisms. From the kalpa's beginning, there are inherited traces. The Nine Sentences Commentary immediately follows that usual practice, tentatively taking that as the second sentence. By this it is called "long-established." When reaching Dignāga, he investigated the reality, taking Buddhist disciple syllogisms as the second sentence and Vaiśeṣika syllogisms as contradictory determination procedures. Not just saying "Nine Sentences verses" but "in Nyāyamukha verses" - the meaning lies therein. The Commentary on Mysteries states: "Why did Yulong断定 it as correct cause?" - if not indicating Nine Sentences verses, what else would be indicated? By this the Compilation's intention can be inferred. Question: The Nyāyamukha merely records Akṣapāda's verses and completely does not speak of changing establishers. How do we know it further takes Buddhist disciples? Those fourteen fault-types immediately follow Akṣapāda's explanations. We should know it follows ancient establishment-theories. Answer: The Nyāyamukha takes Vaiśeṣika syllogisms as contradictory determination, merely using present teaching's power to断定 them as correct causes. How could one syllogism serve as procedures for both correct and doubtful causes? Thus we know the Nyāyamukha's second sentence is Buddhist disciples. Using the fifth sentence's establisher-opponent as analogy to accomplish this. The Compilation master's questions and answers have deep purport alongside. But that fourteen fault-types mostly follow Akṣapāda - using distinguishing causes and examples etc. as not true faults - this follows Akṣapāda's meaning. Why necessarily attach to Vaiśeṣika syllogisms to show fault-types?

Above: past days' foolish record

Anciently stated: Sound theory's sound-permanence syllogism has two opponents: Vaiśeṣika and Buddhist disciples. Sound and Vaiśeṣika

masters both emerged at the kalpa's beginning, disputing sound's permanence-impermanence. As debate opponents, Vaiśeṣika is not Buddhist dharma. Buddhist disciples emerged in later generations, further allying with Vaiśeṣika school. Since establishments are already the same, they serve concurrently as opponents. The Nine Sentences Causes Commentary indicates contemporary opponents, calling them Vaiśeṣika masters. At various places as appropriate, it raises Buddhist disciples. Generally, Buddhist logic penetrates both internal and external paths. Before Buddhist dharma, Vaiśeṣika was long used as the twenty-eight correct causes. Even if taking Buddhist dharma establishments, how could one suddenly abandon ancient correct causes? The principle of created-impermanence is already the same internally and externally - one should not take this while disliking that. Question: Do the Abbreviated Essential Questions and answers penetrate to both opponents, explaining the absence of contradictory determination? Answer: Only regarding Buddhist disciples does it explain the absence of contradictory determination. The Commentary disputes Vaiśeṣika, the Compilation adds one type. Or the Compilation questions and answers the fifth sentence while the second sentence's establisher remains unexplained.

In ancient times at the Great Hall, this meaning was much used. Dharma Seal of Shūnan'in (Ekyō) established this meaning. (etc.)
Taking the Bunki Commentary as proof: "Like sound opposing Vaiśeṣika etc." - "etc." means Buddhist dharma. The two schools mutually have merits and faults. The Vaiśeṣika tradition's merit is taking contemporary opponents. Its fault is being tentative correct cause that eventually commits contradictory determination. The Buddhist disciple meaning's merit is being flawless correct cause. Its fault is appropriately serving as opponent. When Dignāga recorded Akṣapāda's verses and established-abolished the nine sentences, the twenty-eight sentences secretly combined both masters. Vaiśeṣika's ancient correct causes follow Akṣapāda's establishment; Buddhist dharma's true correct causes are what he further added. Should this meaning be grasped? (Note: "meaning" in one text reads "purport," without question particle)

This meaning does not differ from Vaiśeṣika tradition. But that takes Vaiśeṣika as primary opponent, concurrently taking Buddhist disciples.

【Lower section】
This meaning takes both masters equally without primary-secondary distinction. Therefore the two meanings somewhat differ.

Now further inferring: Dharma particular-characteristic opponents have two major explanations. The Nine Sentences Commentary taking Vaiśeṣika makes this the original meaning. The Abbreviated Essential Questions etc. taking Buddhist disciples makes this a separate explanation outside the Commentary. Question: Taking the Abbreviated Essential as separate explanation is hard to use. Answer: Generally in producing Abbreviated Essentials, their intention should be understood. First: assisting commentary explanations, opening their profound purports. Second: stating separate explanations outside commentaries, revealing meaning's multiple paths. Among these, now regarding the Commentary taking Vaiśeṣika, questioning why nine sentences lack contradictory determination. In the answer, "in Nyāyamukha verses it speaks according to separation" means revising commentary explanation to "speak according to separate establisher-opponent" (meaning). The Commentary's extensive mention of Buddhist disciples above and below does not properly raise opponents but merely clarifies correct causes of establishment. Encountering texts at various places, each should be reconciled○. In Zishui's explanations, there are no Vaiśeṣika texts. The Abbreviated Compilation clearly states Buddhist dharma, and Puyang also agrees.

Scholars definitely will not accept this meaning? But there are major positions, recording this.

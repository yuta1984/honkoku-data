nature to be suitable for the subject? Sameness-difference nature has one substance. Because the combination category is non-substantial, it is provisionally called "existence-nature." Because having its own essence is not absent from its essence. However, because it is not the nature of substantial etc.'s capacity to possess, it is said "cannot possess the four great elements" and "cannot possess substance, quality, and action."

If one follows this meaning, then the Shōshō transmission making bedding, outer buildings, houses etc. partial distinctions is still incorrect. Because the meaning of provisional self-use on houses etc. is not meaning on the subject's eyes etc. All things different in category from the subject are not non-intended.

　　Third year of Jōgen, fifth month, tenth day. At Kasagi Temple's Hannya-bō, I finished contemplating this meaning.
　　Perhaps I have somewhat grasped Master Kojima's intention.

Kojima's Decisive Record says: ○Question: The disciple does not say there is combination's non-substantiality in the possessing existence on substance, quality, action, but says there is combination category's non-substantiality in the non-absent existence on combination categories. Therefore should one still establish the reason "because of having non-substantiality"? Answer: This meaning is not so. If "existence-nature" here means adding the possessing nature on combination categories and calling it "existence-nature," it would be as criticized. However, the establisher and opponent's fundamental intention is just to dispute whether the possessing nature on the three of substance, quality, action has separate existence or separate non-existence. Therefore they just raise the possessing on the three of substance, quality, action and call it "existence-nature." They do not dispute whether the possessing nature on sameness-difference and combination has separate existence or separate non-existence. Therefore it is not adding that possessing nature on combination and calling it existence-nature. Therefore although the disciple says there is non-absent existence on combination categories having combination categories, the subject does not add and raise that possessing on combination. The words "combination is non-substantial" do not pervade the subject

Therefore the disciple still does not establish the reason "because of having non-substantiality." 《This meaning should be kept secret》

Following this explanation, the non-absent existence on combination is the nature of possessing because it has combination's own essence. Therefore it gains the name existence-nature. In the inference "existence-nature is non-substantial," the essential subject's essence only takes the possessing nature of the three categories and does not extend to the latter two categories. However, because the word existence-nature's meaning extends to that non-absence, it comes sideways to become non-intended. Question: Does the combination category turn the reason "having one substance"?
Answer: It does not turn. If one permits turning, why say "it is precisely the sixth category among the nine categories"?
《There should be separate deliberation》

The Dharma-Distinction of the Third Contradiction Inference
　　The partial distinction of cannot-possess-four-great-elements and non-great-seed
First: identical substantial existence 《Ancient masters like Kanri and Myōsen mostly use this meaning》
Second: form, sound etc. of positive examples 《Master Ryūkō》
Third: identical meaning-contradiction 《Bishop Ninkaku of Daianji etc.》
Fourth: the five categories of substance etc. 《Same》
Fifth: mutually accepted existence-nature
Sixth: the two categories of sameness-difference and combination 《Kojima》
Seventh: quality, action, sameness-difference, combination, and space, time, direction, self, mind 《Dharma-Affairs Assistant Archbishop of Commentary》

Among the many transmissions, tentatively taking Kojima's transmission: among the positive example having many dharmas, taking dharmas whose

meaning resembles the subject as non-intended partial distinctions. The three categories of substance etc. are dharma-essences. Great existence is the possessing nature of substance etc. Raising this as the subject. Sameness-difference nature and combination are the nature of enabling sameness-difference and enabling combination for substance etc. Therefore they are taken and divided as non-intended distinctions. 《As in the Clear Source》

Or the form, sound etc. of positive examples are only the two categories of quality and action. How do we know this? Because the "existence-nature is non-substantial" inference is established regarding general categories, and the present inference establishes "non-great-seed" in view of detailed dharma-categories within the three categories of substance etc. Therefore positive examples also take the detailed dharmas like form and sound within the two categories of quality and action. Sameness-difference and combination do not divide into separate dharma-numbers. Why take them? Question: If so, are the two categories of sameness-difference and combination not included in the two classes of same and different? How can one permit third double-negation things? Answer: Having things not included in the two classes within one dharma-list makes the third double-negation. The general categories of sameness-difference and combination are not detailed dharmas. Why make them double-negation for the present inference? Question: What faults do the other meanings have? Answer: Within the meaning of identical substantial existence there are also two explanations. First is dharma accepted by the opponent, second is identical substantial existence accepted by the establisher. The former meaning is hard to rely on. Dharma accepted by the opponent is hard to carry in the establisher's words 《This is one》. Also, the subject's self-characteristic contradiction inference should have the fault of subject-distinction, because identical substantial existence should be made partial distinction 《This is two》. In the "sound is impermanent" inference, taking the opponent's accepted non-consciousness reverse impermanence as non-intended should attach the fault of dharma-distinction contradiction 《This is three》. The latter meaning seems reasonable at first but ultimately does not stand. Question: What is that transmission's meaning? Answer: The teacher explains the three categories of substance etc. and states the fourth existence category. The disciple does not accept and establishes "identical substantial existence." The teacher temporarily permits this, goes beyond to explain sameness-difference nature,

【Lower section】
finally establishing "separate-from-substance existence-nature." The identical substantial existence permitted in between becomes the non-intended distinction.
《That is to say》 Question: This reasoning is reasonable, but why not use it? Answer: The teacher's temporarily allowing identical substantial existence in between is not acceptance. It just stops the dispute, finally wanting to establish sameness-difference nature to accomplish separate-from-substance existence-nature. How could it become what the establisher accepts? Also, subject self-characteristic contradiction should have subject-distinction faults, as in the previous transmission. Also there is no evidence.

The identical meaning-contradiction and positive example form, sound etc. transmissions are like the usual difficulties. The meaning of five categories of substance etc. and the commentary masters' transmissions do not escape the fault of making positive examples non-intended.

The meaning of mutually accepted existence is probably also not so. The commentary says "because it is the nature of capable non-absence on substance, quality, action, it establishes the qualified subject" 《text》. Since it is already capable-possessing dharma, why say "cannot possess the four great elements"? Also, the "existence-nature is non-substantial" inference does not intentionally separate from substantial existence. The explicitly stated non-absence accordingly perishes. Following that analogy, it is not the intended thesis of "cannot possess four great elements and is non-great-seed." Mutually accepted existence-nature should also accordingly perish. Who would substitute for the explicit statement?

　　The rights and wrongs of various meanings especially fear external examination and should be considered carefully.

The Dharma-Distinction of the Fourth Contradiction Inference
　　Cannot possess substance, quality, action; separate from substance etc. subject
First: combination category 《Kojima》　　Second: mutually accepted existence
Third: identical substantial existence　　　Fourth: identical meaning-contradiction

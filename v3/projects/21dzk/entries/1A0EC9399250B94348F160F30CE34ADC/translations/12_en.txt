Question: If so, does this established-dharma first exist in the qualified-subject, then descend to the predicand, and later return and remain in the qualified-subject? Answer: If discussing the sequence of meanings, even if permitting that, what fault would there be? However, the mental acceptance of the established always remains in the qualified-subject. Through expedient means it is deceptively established, disputed at the predicand location. Actually there is nothing that becomes same-example. Because desiring to make it equal to same-examples, there are such subtleties. If qualified-subjects had no mental acceptance and predicands had no front-back, this matter would generally be difficult to establish. Question: Because established-is-dharma, is existence-nature being called dharma due to relying on the predicand's dharma name? Answer: Yes. Because desiring to manifest by relying on predicand words, the dharma name is established.

Previously obtaining these two inferences, I discarded the former meaning and adopted the latter proposal. However, now re-examining carefully, the former proposal should generally be maintained. The meaning of established-being-dharma is perhaps still not the commentary's intent.

Different Meanings of Established-Dharma
First interpretation: Under qualified-subject existence-nature, there is an existence-nature separate-from-reality existence-nature mental-acceptance syllogism. That mental-acceptance syllogism makes total-thesis predicand the established-dharma. The non-reality predicand manifests the desired thesis. It is expedient establishment. The present syllogism has two-layer established-dharma. (Above is received teaching)

Second interpretation: Established-dharma has two layers, as before. However, outside verbal-expression qualified-subjects, there are no mental-acceptance syllogism qualified-subjects. Only verbal-expression existence-nature, with mental-acceptance non-reality existence-nature, mutually differing in inseparability-nature, is called mental-acceptance syllogism.

【Lower section】
Third interpretation: Verbal-expression existence-nature and mental-acceptance separate-from-reality existence-nature are called "total," separate-from-reality existence-nature not separated from existence-nature is called "thesis." Like contradictory words. (Permanent-impermanent opposition is called "opposition;" impermanent contradicting permanent is called "contradiction.") Qualified-subjects are exclusively well-established qualifieds. Dharma has two layers. Viewing them separately, they are well-established predicands. The aspect not separated from qualified-subjects - this is dharma.

Fourth interpretation: Under qualified-subject existence-nature, there is separate-from-reality existence-nature mental acceptance. There is no separate mental-acceptance syllogism. This mental acceptance, though obtaining the dharma name, is not called predicand. "Dharma means predicand" is discussed regarding dharma-specific-characteristics etc.

Fifth interpretation: Mental-acceptance separate-from-reality existence-nature is called established-dharma, also called predicand. Substance-meaning three names penetrate three-layer opposition. Because through verbal-mental opposition they obtain qualified-predicand names.

Sixth interpretation: Seeing additional-word establishment, it is called predicand. The rest is like the previous meaning.

Seventh interpretation: Though there is no mental-acceptance syllogism, it is provisionally called predicand. Not called predicand through verbal-mental opposition, nor called predicand by seeing additional-word should-be-established. Directly using mental-acceptance separate-from-reality existence-nature meaning, analogizing to other comparative-syllogism predicands, that name is established.

Eighth interpretation: There are no two-layer established-dharmas. Under qualified-subject existence-nature, mentally accepting separate-from-reality great-existence-nature, using non-reality words, desiring to transmittingly accomplish this. Because it is what predicand-dharma accomplishes, it obtains the dharma name.
This meaning's intent: At the predicand location there is completely no front-back. Only using non-reality words, accomplishing qualified-subject existence-nature's underlying separate-from-reality having-substance existence-nature. Like using fingertip to point at the moon in the sky.

Ninth interpretation: Under qualified-subject existence-nature, there is separate-from-reality great-existence-nature mental acceptance. In the back of non-reality words, there is separate-from-reality having-substance meaning. Like having-conditions-nature words carrying non-reality meaning in their back. Front-back both belong to verbal expression. The establisher's intent: at the predicand location desiring to accomplish qualified-subject mental-acceptance great-existence, but because it differs from examples, opponents examine and establish faults. That great-existence is not proper established-dharma. Because desiring to accomplish by relying on dharma, it obtains the dharma name.

In this meaning, because predicands divide into front-back it differs from the previous. Because predicand-back is not called mental acceptance, it differs from predicand mental-acceptance transmission. Separated wheel-light and sun-disc can serve as analogy.

Tenth interpretation: Existence-nature separate-from-reality having-substance is one thing. Within this, existence-nature exists in qualified-subjects, separate-from-reality having-substance exists in predicands.

In this meaning, taking out the hem of lower garments from within sleeves can serve as analogy. The hem emerging is like verbal expression; the interior hidden is like mental acceptance.

Eleventh interpretation: Qualifieds have mental acceptance, predicand words have backs. Qualified mental acceptance is separate-from-reality great-existence-nature. Predicand back is the meaning of existence-nature being separate from reality etc. and having substance. Though both are existence-nature, in qualified-subjects it is raised as substance, in predicands it is accomplished as meaning. Because of inseparability-nature, they mutually belong to each other. Syllogisms accomplishing qualified-subjects differ from sound-impermanence syllogisms etc. If not so, how could predicand locations accomplish existence-nature substance? If not accomplishing existence-nature, how could it be considered different-example? This is precisely using existence-nature as dharma. If accomplished and remaining in qualified-subjects

【Lower section】
This meaning's intent: The qualified's substance is existence-nature. Above this existence-nature, adding meaning to say "existence-nature of separate-from-reality having-substance." This is called mental acceptance. The predicand's meaning is separate-from-reality having-substance. Above this meaning, adding qualified-subject substance, saying "existence-nature's separate-from-reality having-substance."

Twelfth interpretation: Separate-from-reality having-substance is predicand's back. That substance is precisely qualified-subject.

Inquiry: Great-existence and sameness-difference both have substance. These are equal parts. Why does predicand's back point to existence-nature substance? Answer:

Thirteenth interpretation: Existence-nature is existence separate from reality etc. That existence is precisely substance. The deeper meaning: Reality etc. are not non-existent, because they become great-existence substance. What this school calls "having-substance" things is precisely great-existence-nature.

Inquiry: Sameness-difference-nature also has its own substance. How can saying "having-substance" make this great-existence? Answer: Reality etc. having substance temporarily penetrates great-existence sameness-difference. Then having one reality etc. is a category of existence. Investigating its ultimate, it becomes great-existence. Sameness-difference-nature's own substance is not non-existent, but is not the reality etc. having-substance meaning now being discussed. What is now called "existence" is both meaning and substance. Using separate-from-reality existence, if taken as meaning it is dharma, if taken as substance it is qualified-subject. Using sameness-difference-nature, regarding meaning it is same-example, regarding substance it is different-example. The commentary says: "Already using separate-from-reality existence-nature as same-example, also being equally existing as established-dharma in the thesis" clarifies the equal aspect. Existence-nature is the meaning of existence. Not having-substance. The Compendium says: "This is taking separate-from-reality etc. existing-meaning as dharma"

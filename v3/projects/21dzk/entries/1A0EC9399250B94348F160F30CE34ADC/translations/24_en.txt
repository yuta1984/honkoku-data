because each one can be established. The positive example of the three-violation inference says "form, sound, etc." and does not take the general category. The four-violation inference generally establishes the doctrine of the six categories having separate essences, revealing that beyond substance, etc., which are the possessor and possessed of the three categories, there are separate essences. Through the explicit statement of the predicate, one can know this meaning. Based on this, it should be said: the three inferences "non-substance, etc." establish the meaning of the possessor in relation to the possessed substance, etc., thus being limited only to the three categories. The phrase "etc." in "separated from substance, etc." in the four-violation inference has complications, and the specific and general aspects are extremely contrived. Combined violations arise from this. One should be able to distinguish this well.

○Establishing inferences and examining fallacies
First, within the inner illumination gate, doctrinal positions are disputed. Next, the adversary investigates the inference's meaning and decides where the dispute remains. After the proponent permits that interpretation, the characteristics of fallacies are properly demonstrated. Inference forms are various. In the great treatise there are two: first, disputing essence; second, disputing meaning. Disputing essence also has two: first, complete lack of mutual acceptance, such as when inner and outer paths dispute the divine self. Second, having two gates of acceptance and non-acceptance. Proponent and adversary both follow one teaching, and regarding what it teaches, they dispute whether essence exists or not, such as regarding contact arising from contact and conditioned characteristics. However, when disputing essence, mostly words of existence/non-existence are used as predicates, or there is contrived establishment using expedient words. If using words of existence/non-existence to establish self-inference and other-

inference, using unestablished essence to directly raise the subject, there is no contrived establishment. If establishing using expedient words, the subject has implicit meaning, like the inference "being-nature is non-substantial." 《The above two gates are complete non-mutual acceptance》 If accepting shared teaching to dispute essence, there are again two: first, using words of existence/non-existence - the contact inference and conditioned characteristics inference, etc. Second, establishing through expedient words - the consciousness-only inference, etc. 《Śubhagupta's inference: is it the existence/non-existence type, or expedient words? There should be two interpretations》 However, when disputing essence regarding shared teaching, even if there are words of existence/non-existence, there is still the gate of belonging to meaning. Regarding essence, they mutually believe. 《The Vaiśeṣika five-summit being-nature words are still not shared teaching. Although the "existence" in existence/non-existence appears shared, if ultimately accomplished, that essence is not mutually accepted. One should consider this》 If it is an inference establishing meaning, the thesis-basis is mostly mutually accepted, so is there no meaning of contrived establishment? However, those that appear to dispute meaning but actually extend to essence-disputing may have contrived establishment. 《The above is the general meaning》

○Contrived inferences necessarily have complications in the predicate
According to Kojima's understanding, the word "non-substantial" has the meaning of existing separate from substance. Also, even when using the original method, there is still the meaning of creating conditional nature of existence within "non-substantial" 《Various sayings》 《Regarding the subject's essential characteristic of conditioned characteristics, the Lamp's interpretation has complications. This is an example》 If not so, there would be no path for examining the subject's implicit meaning. How could one directly determine the two examples in relation to the subject? Although that true implicit meaning secretly carries the subject's words, one investigates and sees it through the predicate. Both subject and dharma - these terms are not exhausted. Using inner and outer doctrines to face the inference's verbal force, following whether meaning is exhausted or not, one should determine the presence or absence of contrived establishment. Among these, if using predicates of existence/non-existence, generally both dharma and subject lack contrived establishment, like the inference of contact having separate essence. However, the conditioned characteristics inference initially, regarding permanent characteristics, sees that the dispute lies in the predicate's words and applies dharma essential characteristic's inference-contradiction, etc. Even if the proponent, to avoid this fallacy

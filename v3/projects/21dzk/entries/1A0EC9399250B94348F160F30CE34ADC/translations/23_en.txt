Regarding the criticism "how can one create indefiniteness?" The Lamp Commentary states: "'Non-four-great-elements' is already the predicate, so how can the predicate be taken to create an indefinite fallacy?" If we reverse the predicate "non-four-great-elements," it immediately becomes the predicate "four-great-elements." Since the four great elements are already the predicate, how can the predicate immediately become the negative example? The meaning is: thesis and example must necessarily be different things. One should not use the four great elements to establish the thesis "this is four-great-elements." It does not mean that by raising the predicate "non-four-great-elements," one immediately sees the four great elements as negative examples without indefinite fallacy. By raising the thesis with predicate "non-four-great-elements," one conversely reveals the thesis "this is four-great-elements."

Regarding the manifest text of the Lamp Commentary, Kojima's challenging argument seems truly difficult to escape. If one skillfully explores its meaning, it is not without deep intention. Otherwise, how could Zenshu fail to understand the principles of establishment and refutation and mistakenly create this interpretation?

Now I inquire: The predicate of the consciousness-only logical inference establishes "not separate from eye-consciousness" and uses eye-consciousness as the positive example. This is completely identical to this case.

Someone responds to the foolish objection: "Separate" and "not separate" are meanings pertaining to essence. The meaning of color "not being separate from eye-consciousness" differs from the meaning of eye-consciousness "not being separate from eye-consciousness." This points to the essence of the four great elements, saying "like the four great elements, this is four-great-elements." Therefore it is not the same as that logical inference.

A repeated objection states: This is also the case. Great being would immediately be the four great elements, just as the four great elements are immediately the four great elements. How does this differ from "separate" and "not separate"?

Someone responds: "Not separate" means two things are each distinct. This does not separate from that. Now, regarding immediate

essence, that immediately becomes this dharma, being like this dharma. The obstacle of thesis and example being one thing is difficult to escape. Moreover, in the consciousness-only logical inference, when the thesis states "not separate from eye-consciousness," this refers to the self-witnessing part. The objective aspect of form does not separate from the cognizing self-essence. The positive example "eye-consciousness" refers to the seeing part. Just as the seeing part does not separate from the self-witnessing part. Although the three aspects are not separate, they still establish distinct aspects, thus differing from the immediate-essence thesis and example.

In previous years, at the pavilion in Ume-koji Muromachi in Luoyang, during the deliberation on the one-cause-violating-three inference, there were various doubts about whether the phrase "excluding the four great elements" in the reason was a qualifying expression. I roughly formed an understanding based on Kojima's work. Sanko greatly sided with the Lamp Commentary. Kojima's objection does not accord with Akishinodera's fundamental intention. The questions and answers during that period were numerous and extensively recorded on separate papers. Now I record the outline so that later students may understand it all.

Someone else says: Later, upon seeing the Shimizu marginal notes, above Kojima's interpretation it asks: "For things of the same essence as the predicate dharma to become positive examples and thereby create indefiniteness is extremely difficult." This question's meaning corresponds to Zenshu's interpretation. Although the interpretation is profound, does "things of the same essence" mean that the thesis "this is four-great-elements" and the negative example "four great elements" are of the same essence? If not, how would the predicate "non-four-great-elements" and the negative example "four great elements" not be things of the same essence?

This interpretation is truly reasonable. Difficult to decide, difficult to decide.

○ Concerning the Fourth Violation Inference's Dharma-Distinguishing Characteristics: The Three Categories and Five Categories Separated from Substance, etc.

These are the three categories that should not extend to different interpretations. The matter of the violated inference having indefiniteness in common is perhaps a difficult issue. Now, according to one interpretation: Examining fallacies is the adversary's prerogative. When examining dharma-distinguishing characteristics, no fallacy attaches to the explicit statement because the disputed intention lies in the implicit meaning. If one were to examine indefiniteness in common, one could not then attach the fallacy of dharma-distinguishing characteristics. Since the explicit statement is already refuted, there is no need to seek fallacies in the implicit meaning. This doctrinal position is recorded in various places.

Question: If so, why examine only dharma-distinguishing characteristics? Answer: The commentary master wishes to demonstrate the doctrine that one cause comprehensively violates three. Beyond contradictory causes, what other fallacies would be revealed?

○ Even when the Subject's Essential Characteristic lacks implicit meaning, it can still constitute a contradiction

There is one interpretation of this type: the three violations, four inferences, etc. Question: The latter three contradictions have implicit meaning. If there were no implicit meaning, how could they consequently establish the subject? If one says "direct establishment," this violates the texts of both treatises that determine positive and negative examples. Answer: When the subject directly raises an unestablished dharma-essence, and the predicate establishes it with expressions like "existent/non-existent" or "non-substantial, non-four-great-elements," although it establishes the dharma-thesis at one level, it beneficially establishes the subject. Therefore, the intention remains with the subject. The adversary investigates what is consequently established and examines the subject's essential characteristic. Since positive and negative examples are first determined in relation to the predicate, this does not contradict the two treatises. Question: Even in inferences where the qualified term raises a dharma-essence and the predicate establishes expressions of existence/non-existence, can one examine the subject's essential characteristic? Answer: Yes. Then

【Lower section】
"Regarding the established inherent nature in particular and general opposition, namely my inherent nature and dharma inherent nature, whether existent or non-existent" - this is an inference establishing the subject. Since there already exists such meaning of establishing the subject, why would the adversary, knowing this, not apply the subject's essential characteristic? Therefore, according to Kojima's understanding, in the inference "being-nature is non-substantial," the word "non-substantial" constitutes one level, and "existing separate from substance, etc." constitutes the second level. These are front and back aspects. Sameness-difference nature accomplishes these two levels. This represents the doctrine of equal existence. This is the sage's inference, establishing that being-nature exists separate from substance. The word "existent" is precisely the predicate of ordinary existence/non-existence. If so, even without implicit meaning, why not allow this? Therefore, Kojima states that the subject "being-nature" has no implicit meaning and directly raises great being-nature. He also explains "contradictory [inference], self [inference], other [inference], and common [inference]." The contradicted is a self-inference. The contradicting is an other-inference. Taking this as the true meaning: "Because the words are the same but the meanings different, there are no various fallacies" - this is it.

If so, for inferences without implicit meaning, why not apply this fallacy?

○ The matter that the intentions of the latter two contradictions, along with the three-violation and four-violation inferences, are not the same

The master teacher wishes to establish the great being category and provisionally sets up logical inferences. Sometimes directly disputing immediate/separate, sometimes generally establishing the six categories and separately accomplishing great being. Directly disputing immediate/separate also has two types. First: generally establishing three logical inferences against the three categories of substance, etc., like the inference "being-nature is non-substantial, etc." Second: accomplishing this regarding the separate dharma-gates within the three categories of substance, etc. Like the three-violation inference establishing "non-four-great-elements," tentatively raising the four elements of earth, etc. among the substance category. One could also say "not space-time, etc." In relation to the twenty-four quality categories and five action categories, all

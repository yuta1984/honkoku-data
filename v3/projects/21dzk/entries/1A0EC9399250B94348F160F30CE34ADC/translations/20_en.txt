　levels. This most certainly has its origins. This meaning should be trusted.
　○Similarities and differences between Kojima's commentary-record judgment and Dō
First says: Dō-record's intention similarly uses separate methods. Commentary-record jointly presents both original and separate transmissions. Taking separate methods as their own true meaning. Dō is also clear. However, regarding different texts, the treatise points to the previous qualified-subject self-characteristic method, saying "namely in the previous thesis." It briefly doesn't raise creative-causation-nature syllogisms. But opponents advance to examine the establisher's mental acceptance, making creative-causation-nature the predicand words. This attaches the present error. Commentary-judgment reveals that original intention, saying there should be creative-causation-nature syllogisms. Reiterating the meaning: the treatise briefly regarding non-reality syllogisms, distantly shows methods. Actually there should be creative-causation-nature syllogisms 《that's the meaning》.
Second says: Both places say "treatise is original method, commentary-judgment is separate method." Because Dō's final text is clear. Already saying "if depending on this, it's only the previous existence-nature non-reality syllogism." Using previous syllogisms as present methods. Question: In original method transmission, regarding violation-of-treatise error, the treatise's creative-causation-nature is expressed-thesis 《etc.》. How should this be reconciled? Answer 《character missing?》: The treatise has two tendencies. Using previous syllogisms as present methods—this is the correct intention. Creative-causation-nature is namely mentally accepted creative-great-existence-causation-nature. However, using commonly accepted words to speak of creative-causation-nature distantly reveals separate method predicand expressed-words. The commentary master grasped this intention, saying "this word 'existence' is the existence of existence-nonexistence." If the treatise lacked this secret intention, why would commentary-judgment suddenly use separate methods? The senior confronting original method schools who completely don't permit creative-causation-nature syllogisms, there must be syllogisms that change predicands. The treatise saying "creative-causation-nature" is namely expressed-thesis

it says. It's not that it doesn't preserve the meaning of previous syllogisms as present methods. Commentary-record marks separate method meaning, saying "there must be separate syllogisms" means there must be separate methods changing predicands, not taking only original methods 《that's the meaning》. Question: Record's later text says: The treatise saying "as namely this reason《up to》creative-causation-nature" is not creative-great-existence-causation-nature. This is commonly accepted creative-causation-nature. Commentary saying "this word existence is existence of existence-nonexistence" explains this treatise text. 《Above》 Creative-causation-nature words correctly speak creative-great-existence-causation-nature mental acceptance, distantly making known expressed creative-causation-nature—why dislike creative-great-existence-causation-nature? Clearly knowing Kojima's intention exclusively says expressed creative-causation-nature.
Answer: Not exceeding previous violation-of-treatise error. On days permitting separate methods exist, treatise creative-causation-nature is commonly accepted expression, not creative-great-existence-causation-nature. When using previous syllogisms, it's mentally accepted creative-great-existence-causation-nature. "Not creative-great-existence-causation-nature" differs from Heki-master saying "treatise creative-causation-nature is namely creative-great-existence-causation-nature"—expressed creative-causation-nature is not creative-great-existence-causation-nature. Record's distaste for Heki-master is clearly seen. The textual sequence should be examined and understood.
Third says: Commentary-record extensively accomplishes previous separate method meanings. Dō's initial text is also the same. Later text says: "However, treatise bases on establishers etc." means treatise bases on original methods, commentary-judgment shows separate methods 《that's the meaning》. This changes two-volume transmission, first establishing this meaning. Question: "However treatise bases on establishers" and below stating separate meanings is hard to believe. Having accomplished separate dharma meanings, it generally concludes treatise and commentary-judgment intentions. Why make it separate intention? Answer: Above accomplishing only separate method meanings finished. Should be kept secret only 《text》. This concludes separate

method transmission. "However treatise" and below changes single-direction separate method meaning—treatise bases on original methods 《that's the meaning》. The main point is the same as before in grasping treatise intention. Because it differs from before, the character "however" is placed. "This interpretation is superior" also concludes this meaning. Already knowing there are double concluding texts, they should be known as separate explanations. Using this concluding text should be the ultimate true meaning.
　Among the three meanings, taking the latter as good. The senior first secretly established separate method meaning, using many textual principles to accomplish it. Later well discerning treatise-commentary-judgment original intention. Treatise is original method, commentary-judgment is separate method.
　Inquiring: Judgment and Dō annotated this in Anwa first year 《etc.》. After that, passing eighteen years, reaching Tenen third year, produced two-volume records. 《Each conclusion states | record clear》 If judgment and Dō changed two-volume transmission, the periods greatly differ. Answer: Dō is the earlier writing. Because postscript text is evident. However, the two lines of text from "However treatise bases on establishers" below might have been added later. While re-editing books, repeatedly adding separate meanings is common practice. Namely Dō has examples. Two-volume record uses commonly accepted existence-nature as creative-non-existence-causation-nature substance, but Dō changes this taking reality etc. Following this, after commentary-record, re-editing Dō, many separate meanings might have been added.
　　This meaning is complete as in Myōhon. Regarding similarities and differences of both places, it remains unrecorded. How could today's three meanings not become secret decisions? These words are excessive. Should be feared and avoided.
Private record's later text says:

【Lower section】
　Depending on commentary to see treatise text, there are slight differences in discrimination. Namely commentary's upper section depends on separate methods to interpret it. At this time treatise's creative-causation-nature is commonly accepted creative-causation-nature. Creative-non-existence-causation-nature omits the "great" character. Also what conflicts with this—the conflicted—the treatise lacks. Record says: The treatise lacking creative-great-existence-causation-nature words is this intention. Commentary's lower section depends on original methods to interpret. Creative-causation-nature is creative-great-existence-causation-nature. Also this corresponds to what the lower phrase points to as conflicted substance. Therefore regarding treatise text, upper creative-causation-nature text and lower creative-non-existence-causation-nature text both omit the "great" character above and below 《that's the meaning》
　　Depending on this inference, commentary and private record are same as Dō—treatise as original method, also without special conflicts. Perhaps.
Myōtōshō says: ○What hindrance is there? Though great-existence is not reality etc., with those reality etc. dharma-gates, this is separate and also allows having no substance. Because unable to definitively establish great-existence is existence, previously established syllogisms considering fear of incompletion. Sāṃkhya intention says: Now should accomplish establishment making meaning exhaustive, principle ultimate, and manifest. Therefore depending on previous gates' word-manifest comparative syllogisms, because incomplete, this is undesired thesis. Within that, previously established mentally accepted distinction dharma-gates—great-existence is existence, not identity-difference—take as desired. Then depending on word-manifest comparative syllogisms, within single-type thesis, artificially establish mentally accepted third-type thesis. Within one syllogism, accomplishing such dual-type thesis together, therefore violating conflicts 《text》.
　Inquiring: Now saying "incomplete" and "ultimate"—if not establishing creative-causation-nature syllogisms,

The latter only establishes non-being-causative. They do not exist simultaneously. How does this differ from the usual case? Answer: Whether you say they exist simultaneously or not, both are without fault. The example of "necessarily for the use of others" is as previously presented.

○ Concerning Being-Causative Nature
Question: Do the verbal expressions and cognitive awareness that can express/cognize substance, quality, and action merely express/cognize the three, or do they make expressing/cognizing into "being"? Answer: Although sometimes they make it into "being," this is not necessarily so. In the sense of taking the three as objects, one simply knows substance, knows quality, etc. When the mind takes objects, how does this differ from what is explained in Buddhist teachings? Question: If so, why does the commentary say "Similarly arising verbal expressions express the three as being, similarly arising cognitive awareness cognizes the three as being. Both expression and cognition place the word 'being.' Clearly know that taking the meaning of 'being as' is what this logical inference establishes"? Answer: In ordinary expression and cognition, there are objects expressed and objects cognized. Now, since we are investigating the source of being, we particularly say "being as."

Question: As for being-causative nature, is there cognitive awareness of substance, quality, and action, or is there cognitive awareness of great being? Answer: The two interpretations ultimately return to one. First, we interpret this in terms of the expression and cognition of substance, etc. Therefore we say "express the three, cognize the three." The private record says "this is substance, this is quality, etc." However, substance, etc. are not non-existent; they are precisely great being. If we can investigate their source, they return to being cognitive awareness of great being.

Question: If so, there is cognitive awareness of sameness-difference nature, not cognitive awareness of great being. Why use it as a positive example? Answer: Although cognitive awareness that directly cognizes great being and cognitive awareness that directly cognizes sameness-difference nature are different, we do not take that. Now we discuss this from the perspective of the three categories. The cognitive awareness that cognizes the three categories turns to two objects. One turns to great being, one turns to sameness-difference. So-

【Lower section】
called "being as" turns to great being; "as substance, as quality, etc." turns to sameness-difference. Great being is universal being-nature. Sameness-difference is particular nature. If there were no great being, substance, etc. could not exist. Since substance, etc. already exist, there is cognitive awareness. That substance, etc. exist is precisely great being. The cause of having cognitive awareness is great being. If there were no sameness-difference, it could not be "this is substance, this is quality, this is action." In terms of becoming substance, quality, action, sameness-difference is the cause. Therefore, the cause of expressing/cognizing the three is sameness-difference. The cause of "being as" is great being.

Question: If so, how when using sameness-difference nature as an example to establish being-causative nature, does it serve as a positive example without committing the fallacy of unestablished thesis? Answer: When it provisionally allows "not without being," it resembles a positive example. Discussing it based on reality, "not without being" ultimately returns to great being. Therefore, when "being-causative nature exists" establishes great being, it is not a positive example. Regarding the predicate "being-causative," there are two alternative implicit meanings. The proponent differentiates it as "this is great-being-causative nature." That being is real great being, because what is not great being is not being.

Question: Is "being-causative nature" being-causative as nature, or the nature of being-causative? Answer: First, we name it "cognitive awareness of the three categories." Since it is a dependent compound, we call it "being-causative nature." Ultimately, this is cognitive awareness of great being. Being-causative is identical to nature.

Question: According to this interpretation, are substance, etc. non-existent dharmas? If so, this greatly contradicts their school. Substance is precisely permanent, real dharma. Quality and action also each have functions. If they are not non-existent dharmas, how can we exclusively take all existing things in the three categories and make them all return to great being and sameness-difference? Answer: The three categories are not non-existent dharmas. They are what great being and sameness-difference possess. However, what we are now discussing is establish-

ing the meaning of the great being category, using all existents as the gateway to great being. For example, like the two gateways of "discussing nature and function separately" and "subsuming characteristics under nature" among the four ways of explaining essence in Buddhist teachings.

Cognizing great being and substance, etc. together. When separately cognizing only substance, etc. apart from great being, is this absent? However, regarding great being, is there a time when it alone is cognized? This is when we consider establishing the dharma-gate of great being. This should be contemplated.

Alternatively, one might say: This is when substance, quality, and action have expression and cognition. What directly has expression and cognition are the three categories. Taking that cause, we call great being "the nature of being-causative." Sameness-difference nature also has this meaning. In terms of what is called "being," it does not reach great being.

Also, "being-causative" means there is great being's own cognitive awareness. Generally, when substance, etc. and great being are in combination, expression and cognition arise. Their expressive words and cognitive awareness commonly turn to substance, etc. and great being. They do not separately express and cognize each. In manifest discussion, it merely seems to express and cognize substance, etc. Speaking in terms of substance, it also expresses and cognizes great being. The aspect of having cognitive awareness of great being becomes the present thesis.

Within this interpretation there is another meaning. "Being-causative" means the meaning of cognizing and becoming being. It manifests mental activity and understanding. It is not the meaning of the object-essence having cognitive awareness.

○ The Three-Violation Inference
Inquiry: When the reason says "excluding the four great elements," is this a qualifying expression? Answer: Yes. Therefore, Ko-

【Lower section】
jima cites the Zhou Record: "If we do not say 'excluding the four great elements,' there will be an indefinite fallacy... To eliminate this error, the reason therefore says: excluding the four great elements." Question: The Bright Lamp Commentary cites the middle volume of the commentary: "Taking exclusion of the four great elements and things other than being-nature together as positive examples." "Non-four-great-element" is already the predicate. How can the predicate be used to create an indefinite fallacy? Therefore, the phrase "excluding the four great elements" in the reason reveals that entities other than the four great elements are not non-existent. Also, Master Taigen formulated the reason of this inference as "because entities other than the four great elements are acknowledged as not non-existent." Therefore we know it is not a qualifying expression.

Answer: If we do not place the phrase "excluding the four great elements," the four great elements would come to form an indefinite opponent. Because we wish to eliminate this error, we place this phrase. The Zhou Record should be taken as the definitive measure. However, regarding the interpretation in the Bright Lamp Commentary, Kojima objects: If "non-four-great-element" is made the predicate, then the four great elements immediately become the negative example. How then can one say "How can the predicate be taken to create an indefinite fallacy"? All logical inferences create indefiniteness in this way. Therefore, the meaning of this commentary is extremely difficult to obtain... This objection is quite reasonable. Consequently, we do not provisionally maintain it. When Master Taigen says "other than the four great elements," this is also qualification. Therefore Kojima says: "Saying 'other than the four great elements' and saying 'excluding the four great elements' have no difference in meaning. Both are expressions that qualify away indefiniteness."

Someone says: Now examining the venerable Zenshu's intention, "non-four-great-element" is the predicate. Color, sound, etc., in relation to this, serve as positive examples for the thesis. Taking the four great elements as negative examples. In relation to the thesis "this is four-great-elements," they are positive examples. If so, how would one create [an inference like] "the four great elements are four great elements"

Myōyōshō (Different Version [Qualified-subject Self-characteristic])

Question: In the syllogism "existence-nature is non-reality," how do we know it's a deceptive establishment? Raising existence-nature establishes non-reality. Non-reality already eliminates immediate-reality and reaches immediate-reality. When establishing non-reality, the thesis meaning is already complete. Should this be called a syllogism disputing dharma self-characteristics?
Answer: The teacher establishes six categories. The great-existence category is one of the six categories. Although the substance ■■■■■■ permits the meaning of what possesses, using that existence as immediately reality-etc. substance. Know this. Teacher and disciple dispute the existence or non-existence of great-existence substance. If manifesting and accomplishing this substance, it's necessary to say "my existence-nature" for the qualified-subject and "should have separate substance" for the predicand. However, the qualified-subject has no distinction, making one see commonly accepted existence-nature. Know this. Under the qualified-subject, separate-from-reality great-existence-nature mental acceptance is placed. Saying "non-reality" for the predicand causes ■■■■■■. This is the very hidden establisher's original intent, not manifested in words. Know this. This predicand ■■■■ establishes. That deceptive establishment means the so-called non-reality words have front and back; the back preserves separate-from-reality having-substance. The qualified-subject has mental acceptance, the predicand has deceptive establishment. Generally, opponents use syllogism components to respond to previous inner-clarity gate dispute boundaries, seeing ■■■■■■ dissatisfaction. They know the syllogism's deceptive establishment and non-deceptive establishment. In deceptive establishment, the latter three characteristics ■■■■■ have ■ acceptance.

Question: Why doesn't the sage establish separate-from-reality having-substance predicand? In the custom of establishing syllogisms, one truly wishes to exhaust meanings. Among these, parts that same-examples cannot reach are set aside without establishment. If parts that same-example power can reach, predicands must necessarily be clearly established. However, separate-from-reality having-substance meaning already possesses same-different nature. If predicands are established thus, they can surpass non-reality words. Seeing reasons through examples, reasons can completely possess three characteristics, reason-example power sufficient to accomplish separate having-substance thesis. Why set aside the superior to establish the inferior, abandoning the manifest for the hidden?
Answer: As in today's challenge, in the sage's original intent, whether this syllogism could be satisfying or not. Challenging as insufficient ■ manifesting separate-from-reality great-existence-nature name-substance therefore. Even if establishing having-substance predicand, if disputes aren't yet exhausted, it's better to establish deceptive-establishment syllogism.
Question: In accomplishing qualified-subject substance with existence/non-existence predicands, there are already correct syllogisms. In such types that establish qualified-subjects, if the sage establishes having-substance predicand, why isn't the thesis meaning satisfying?
Answer: Though correct syllogisms have self-other-shared, shared-inference is fundamental. In accomplishing substance within shared-inference syllogisms, correct syllogisms are difficult to have. The sage already maintains this principle, making the three components show shared-inference. If not deceptive establishment, that syllogism would necessarily commit faults. Therefore qualified-subjects carry mental acceptance, predicands place deceptive words.
Question: Asvabhāva's syllogism, predicand having-substance syllogism - these are correct syllogisms established by Mahāyāna.

Raising substance in qualified-subjects, establishing separate having-substance in predicands - how is this?
Answer: They are all both establisher-opponent families as Buddha's disciples. They equally depend on and study excellent teachings. Qualified-subjects directly raise commonly accepted teaching-explained dharma-substance. How could there be deceptive establishment? It's not the same as teacher-disciple both schools not yet knowing whether they permit great-existence substance. The repeated meaning is: raising commonly accepted teaching explanations, since permitting substance is already accomplished, even though predicands dispute separate substance, this too is a type of disputing meanings.
Question: In consciousness-only syllogisms, among opponents are included non-Buddhists. Shouldn't qualified-subject form-substance be non-commonly-established?
Answer: That raises eye-experienced form. This is internally-externally commonly accepted substance. Like original-quality form, there really is commonly accepted substance. It's not the same as teacher-disciple disputes. Moreover, that syllogism uses deceptive-establishment methodology, so it shouldn't be challenged.
　　　　The above is one side's questions and answers.
Question: In syllogisms that raise substance in qualified-subjects and establish existence/non-existence words in predicands, do we say "thus established in qualified-subjects" or retain "only accomplished through dharma, accomplishing that dharma"? If saying "only establishing dharma," ■ having-substance predicand already establishes qualified-subject substance. How do sound-impermanence etc. ■■■ accomplish dharma? If not accomplishing qualified-subjects, do that syllogism's same-examples ■ correspond to qualified-subjects or not? If not corresponding to qualified-subjects, existence-nature syllogisms ■ use separate having-substance meaning to accomplish qualified-subject existence-nature. That meaning should also be the same. Why do existence-nature syllogisms, looking toward qualified-subjects, examine and accomplish different examples, while existence/non-existence predicand syllogisms don't become faults?

Answer: Syllogisms raising substance in qualified-subjects and establishing existence/non-existence in predicands are mostly self-inference syllogisms. Qualified-subjects directly raise non-commonly-established dharma-substance, having no mental acceptance. Predicands say "separately having substance etc.," completely without deceptive establishment. Since disputes remain in predicands, same-examples cannot examine and accomplish different examples. Existence-nature syllogisms differ from these, completely not analogous. However, whether separate having-substance syllogisms are named "thus established in qualified-subjects" or not can have two approaches. Among these, naming is fundamental. Logic Gate Treatise originally clarifies correct syllogism characteristics. Therefore, in accomplishing correct syllogism substance, mostly using existence/non-existence predicands draws opponent-evidence wisdom. However, what reason-example power reaches only accomplishes dharma. Repeatedly saying in mind: first using dharma to accomplish dharma, that meaning established completely, finally dwelling in qualified-subject substance. "Thus established in qualified-subjects" - does this naturally accomplish separate provisional power? However, in syllogisms deceptively accomplishing qualified-subjects, initially still wanting to combine substance, since that meaning doesn't establish, they commit latter two contradictions.
　　　　The above is one side's questions and answers.
Question: Does the name "what is established" extend to qualified-subjects? If it doesn't extend, why say "established dharma"? Know this: "what is established" broadly extends to dharma and qualified-subjects; "dharma" narrowly limits to predicands. Total thesis names also follow this. The reason is: if limiting to dharma to establish thesis names, this would be particular thesis, not total meaning. If also the name "what is established" extends to qualified-subjects, in syllogisms disputing dharma self-characteristics, how could total thesis qualified-subjects obtain the name "what is established"?
Answer: The name "what is established" broadly extends to dharma and qualified-subjects. That meaning is like the one-sided challenge. However, sound-impermanence

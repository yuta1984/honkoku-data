When it comes to characteristics, when saying "existence-nature's non-reality etc.," it immediately reveals the meaning of creative-causation-nature. Therefore it says "already accomplishing existence-nature etc." The private record of the main temple and fellow students' records etc., saying that non-reality words contain creative-causation-nature meaning, are the same as this intention.
Third: Through the thesis of existence-nature non-reality's single-level non-separation nature, one knows the creative-great-existence-causation-nature mental acceptance under existence-nature. 《This meaning is extensively recorded by Myōhon》
　Now saying: It's not that non-reality words definitively explore and exhaust qualified-subject mental acceptance, nor is it that there's no meaning of assisting and accomplishing that. Sāṃkhya's original intention in establishing existence-nature non-reality syllogisms accomplishes the separate meanings of separate-from-reality existence-nature substance and creative-causation-nature. Predicand words can accord with that mentally accepted thesis. Because those words are inclusive and have nothing to obstruct. If not establishing in detail makes it difficult to reveal creative-great-existence-causation-nature mental acceptance, then non-reality only barely reveals separate-from-reality meaning, and regarding self-characteristic syllogisms doesn't reach great-existence substance. Why blame the approach of distinctions particularly? It should be known that predicand words take according with pleasure-making as their merit. Going beyond this to seek establishment meaning is probably the addition of separate method schools. Taking consciousness-only syllogisms as proof of this meaning—how could "not-separate-from-eye-consciousness" predicand words reach color-substance? Only because qualified-subjects don't have this mental acceptance, predicands accord and accomplish it 《that's the meaning》. Question: How do we know that existence-nature places must have creative-causation-nature mental acceptance? Answer: If not so, pleasure-making wouldn't be ultimate. Question: Even if under this syllogism it's not ultimate, what error is there? Answer: The teacher-master doesn't separately establish creative-causation-nature syllogisms. If pleasure-making under this syllogism isn't ultimate, then the establisher

　stops without exhausting thesis-meanings. Question: By separately establishing creative-causation-nature syllogisms, that meaning could be exhausted. How do we know it's not established? Answer: Among treatise-masters there's no such proof. The commentary says: The sage having already presented three comparative syllogisms... Sāṃkhya thesis-meanings are all carried out thereby. Outside the three syllogisms of non-reality etc., we don't see creative-causation-nature syllogisms being established. Question: Commentary-judgments permit creative-causation-nature methods. Various places can be examined. Answer: That's to reveal establisher mental acceptance, using meaning to infer and show those methods. By this we know in return: teacher-masters definitively mentally accept creative-causation-nature. How could non-reality syllogisms not carry that mental acceptance? Also, through added-word syllogisms, we know in return the mental acceptance of non-added-word syllogisms.
　　Establishing again: Sāṃkhya only establishes the three comparative syllogisms of non-reality etc., not separately establishing creative-causation-nature syllogisms. But since their thesis-meanings want to accomplish the separate meaning of creative-causation-nature, the meaning of mentally accepting creative-great-existence-causation-nature is also inevitable. Using these two matters, bringing them together to examine: In existence-nature non-reality syllogisms, at qualified-subject existence-nature places, there's creative-causation-nature mental acceptance, using non-reality predicands to assist and accomplish it. That assisting-accomplishing meaning is the aspect of according without violating. Necessarily using predicand words to explore and obtain mental acceptance is the additional meaning of separate method schools. If pleasure-making doesn't exceed the accomplished portion of dharma-thesis, what self-characteristic syllogisms' non-reality thesis accomplishes is barely separate-from-reality etc. meaning, not reaching great-existence substance. Is this making separate-from-reality meaning the point of dispute? Since they already make the establisher's desired portion of what's established exist in this syllogism, reaching great-existence substance, this is also reasonable. If revealing mental acceptance in non-reality dharma-thesis is insufficient, self-

　○Does Creative-Causation-Nature Mental Acceptance Carry Existence-Nature Words?
Transmission says: Creative-causation-nature mental acceptance is the "having" meaning of existence-nature.
Someone says: Creative-causation-nature is examined and placed under existence-nature's "nature" words. "Nature" means dharma-substance. Dharmas having real substance necessarily have capability-to-cognize, so at those nature-places there's the meaning of having capability-to-cognize. Having-cognition-nature is this nature. Question: In Sāṃkhya's intention, outside great-existence identity-difference, there are completely no dharmas obtaining nature-names. Why under nature use reality etc. as partial distinctions? Answer: Even if reality etc., since they already have those substances, how would they not be carried under nature-words? For example, when Buddhist dharma makes phenomena-principle into characteristic-nature, nature is exclusively perfect-accomplished. However, pointing to other-dependent substance-nature, it's also named nature. Because phenomena are also nature.
Question: In sound-impermanence syllogisms, examining creative-sound-having-cognition-nature, non-creative-sound-having-cognition-nature mental acceptance, what words does it carry?
Answer:
Someone says: It's meaning under existence-nature. Question: Existence-nature points to existence-nature substance. Creative-causation-nature means nature having capability-to-cognize 《that's the meaning》. Their meanings are vastly different. What relation makes them carry? 
Answer: At times of qualified-subject distinctions, existence-nature words having capability-to-cognize nature appears 《once》. Under that having-cognition-nature, two etc. are examined. Question: This meaning violates the commentary. The commentary says: That owl-sage

【Lower section】
doesn't trust that apart from reality-quality-action there's separate existence, because of the five peaks. 《text》 According to this text, even at times of qualified-subject distinctions, qualified-subject existence-nature is separate-from-reality existence-nature. Answer:
Someone says: What's the origin of the "creative" character in creative-causation-nature? Someone says: Because the treatise says "creative-causation-nature," it doesn't lose those words. This meaning is so. What intention does the treatise also have in placing "creative" words? The previous doubt isn't yet removed. Now inferring: Because having-cognition-nature mental acceptance doesn't carry existence-nature expressed-words, this word is placed. The meaning is: qualified-subject existence-nature is existence-nature substance. Above that substance there's meaning of having capability-to-cognize. Therefore pointing to existence-nature substance, this substance becomes something having capability-to-cognize 《that's the meaning》. Because it doesn't directly carry words, "creative" words are placed. Other mental acceptances don't have "creative" words. Creative-sound-having-cognition-nature etc. follow today's creative-existence creative-non-existence mental acceptance, being what's examined provisionally. Based on this, it should be called separate meaning of creative-causation-nature under existence-nature, not carrying expressed-words. This is named general mental acceptance. The two distinctions of creative-great creative-non-great, while being under existence-nature, carry creative-causation-nature words. General mental acceptance becomes words looking toward creative-great creative-non-existence distinctions. Violating-three violating-four should follow this.
Question: The commentary says: Existence-nature expressed-words are qualified-subject self-characteristics, creative-causation-nature creative-non-existence-causation-nature are mental acceptance distinctions above this self-characteristic 《text》. Creative-existence creative-non-existence distinctions carry existence-nature expressed-words 《that's the meaning》.
Answer: Not so. Under expressed-words there are two distinctions 《that's the meaning》. It doesn't say they properly carry expressed-words. Under non-reality words, these two etc. don't exist. Opposite to this, under existence-nature expressed-words they exist 《that's the meaning》.
　Though double-level mental acceptance inheritance is old, the embellishment of the "creative" character is unprecedented. Mental acceptance reaching two

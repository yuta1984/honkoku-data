all sentient beings." The commentary states: "Skillful wisdom means not abandoning sentient beings while arousing dharma-selflessness. Aspiration wisdom refers to embracing the affairs of sentient beings through the power of skillful means and eliminating afflictions, etc. That is, taking rebirth through the power of aspiration. This is not the skillful means and aspiration among the ten perfections."

The *Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra* fascicle 7 (*Teaching* chapter) states: "Treatise: All sentient beings without remainder. Commentary: This verse discusses non-contention samādhi. Whatever actions are performed do not arouse afflictive contentions among sentient beings. Treatise: May possibly have defilements. Commentary: The Buddha can accommodate sentient beings' delusions. Even when sentient beings have defilements, the Tathāgata constantly arouses compassionate mind. Treatise: Effortless, effortless, without difference. Commentary: This half-verse clarifies aspiration wisdom. Wanting to know all matters of the three times constitutes aspiration; the Tathāgata's ability to realize and know them all constitutes wisdom. Because cultivation is mature, it is effortless; because habitual tendencies are exhausted, there is no attachment. Through these two meanings, one can realize and know everything. Regarding objects of the three times, because one can know them accurately, there are no obstructions."

*Abhidharmasamuccaya* fascicle 4 states: "Non-contention activity means that whatever words are spoken, all who hear them believe and submit. Aspiration wisdom activity means being able to realize distinct matters of the three times, etc., becoming worthy of respect by all the world, through reaching what all multitudes take refuge in."

*Yogācārabhūmi* fascicle 69 states: "Moreover, wanting him to receive receivable fruits in the present dharma, one skillfully abides in non-contention concentration. Through this cause and condition, using the cultivation of ultimate fourth meditation as support, one generates non-contention characteristic samādhi, protects others' minds, and regarding all deportments one initiates, never causes others to generate afflictive contentions. Therefore this is called non-contention... What is aspiration wisdom? Liberated-both-ways sharp-faculty arhat monks cultivate ultimate fourth meditation as 

support. If in the Śrāvaka vehicle, following the sphere of activity of Śrāvaka wisdom; if in the Pratyekabuddha vehicle, following the sphere of activity of Pratyekabuddha wisdom, they generate such aspirations: 'May I come to know such and such knowable spheres.' From this they enter and maturely cultivate ultimate fourth meditation. Having already entered concentration, they understand everything according to their prior aspirations. All Tathāgatas pervade all knowable spheres without obstruction."

It further states: "Furthermore, just as cultivating ultimate fourth meditation as support generates non-contention and aspiration wisdom, know that all exclusive Buddha-dharma subtle wisdoms possessed by the Tathāgata are likewise. Other supernatural powers, etc., all take the meditations as support and can all be generated."

**Fourth: Clarifying Types of Non-Buddhists**

**Ninety-five Types of Non-Buddhists** (appended to the Six Masters Non-Buddhists)
The six masters each lead fifteen disciples. The total is ninety people. (But excluding the six original masters)

**Five Types of Non-Buddhists:**

1. **Sāṃkhya Non-Buddhists**
2. **Vaiśeṣika Non-Buddhists** (Among the three types of self mentioned in the *Vijñānavāda Treatise*, this is the view of a self that is permanent, pervasive, and equal in measure to space. Both groups hold this view)
3. **Nirgrantha Non-Buddhists** (These are the proponents of the second type of self. The treatise says: "Its substance is permanent yet its measure is indefinite. It expands and contracts according to bodily size." They use cowhide as a metaphor for the self. These are the shameless type. Called Nirgrantha, now called Jñātiputra, translated as "Liberated-from-Bonds Sons." Cultivating ascetic practices for superior causes is called "liberation from bonds." Being naked with little sense of shame. Also called "Bondless." The original master is called "Liberated-from-Bonds," and these are his disciples, hence called "sons")
4. **Beast-Master Non-Buddhists** (There are non-Buddhists called Pūraṇa-kāśyapa, translated as "Beast Master." Just as one sound "go" specifically refers to cattle but generally names beasts, simply saying "cattle master" shows poor understanding of terminology, not that they are masters together with cattle. Like Fuxi, etc. The *Yanmi* explains Fuxi, etc.)

5. **Universally-Emerging Non-Buddhists** (There are also non-Buddhists called Pakudha-kaccāyana, translated as "Universally Emerging." They can emerge from and leave all mundane worlds. These are types of renunciant non-Buddhists. This generally describes the doctrines held by these three groups and five masters. The self, etc., posited by the other ninety types do not differ from these three)

The commentary states: "Although non-Buddhists have many different types of views and attachments, their teachings do not exceed three types."

**The locus of a self that is permanent, pervasive, and equal in measure to space should be observed from beginning to end.**

**Ninety-six Types of Non-Buddhists**
The ninety people should be understood as before. The six types means adding the six original masters.

**Six Master Non-Buddhists**
When Prince Siddhartha renounced the world seeking the Way, there being no Buddha or disciples, he wanted to take those six non-Buddhist masters as teachers to learn and transmit non-Buddhist methods. Hence they are called the Six Masters.

1. **Pūraṇa Kāśyapa** (Pūraṇa is the name, Kāśyapa the surname. Formerly called Pūraṇa Kāśyapa. This is an annihilationist non-Buddhist, also called a nihilistic view non-Buddhist)
2. **Maskarī Gośālīputra** (Maskarī is his own name, Gośālī his mother's name. Maskarī is the son of Gośālī. This is an eternalist non-Buddhist)
3. **Sañjayin Vairaṭīputra** (Sañjayin is his own name, Vairaṭī his mother's name. That child is called "son," like Śāriputra. This is an ascetic non-Buddhist. He taught that the birth and death experienced by sentient beings all result from attachment to pleasure; by properly cultivating ascetic practices, one attains liberation)
4. **Ajita Keśakambala** (Ajita is the name. He let his hair hang down and wore rough cloth, hence called "Hair-Blanket." This is a naturalist non-Buddhist. He taught that all dharmas arise naturally)
5. **Kakuda Kātyāyana** (Kakuda Kātyāyana is the surname. Kakuda refers to form—having a hump on top of the head, like knowing a bull's forehead, hence taking this as the name. This person serves Maheśvara. He taught that Maheśvara Deva can rule over all dharmas)
6. **Nirgrantha Jñātiputra** (This is the Nirgrantha. Also called "shameless." Because his original master cultivated ascetic practices, he is called "Liberated-from-Bonds." Being born from him, he is called "Kinsman-son." This is a "past-action-created-causes" non-Buddhist. All dharmas are causes already created in past lives. Not creating causes now, if one expels past karma, one immediately attains liberation)

There is an explanation of these six masters: they are the masters whom the Buddha, having abandoned his kingdom and renounced the world, sought out for instruction, who taught the Buddha and made him practice asceticism. Hence they are particularly mentioned. However, Udraka Rāmaputra taught the Buddha to attain the concentration of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and Ārāḍa Kālāma taught the Buddha to attain the concentration of nothingness. These likewise taught the Buddha to cultivate ascetic practices. (See the end of *Vimalakīrti Commentary* fascicle 3)

**Fire-Serving Non-Buddhists**

Master Jingxing's *Combined Golden Light Sūtra Commentary* states: "The practice is precisely Brahmanism. Brahmins are called 'outsiders.' At the beginning of the kalpa, disgusted with the world, they dwelt in quiet places, going outside human society, hence the name of the path. (The above concerns Brahmins) The surname is Kauṇḍinya. Kauṇḍinya's name was called 'Fire Vessel.' Originally dwelling among non-Buddhists, serving fire, with fire dwelling in the heart." This explains the location of the Brahmin Kauṇḍinya. (The above concerns fire-serving non-Buddhists. Fire-serving non-Buddhists are one type of ascetic non-Buddhist)

*General Analysis Chapter* states: "Although there are ninety-five types of non-Buddhists, the main ideas do not exceed sixteen variant theories." *Ullambana Sūtra Commentary* states: "Each of these six masters has sixteen disciples, making ninety total. Combined with the six masters makes ninety-six." (I say privately: According to Master Huizhao's explanation, the masters together total 102 people. How should this be reconciled?)

Commentary 1 states: "Treatise: However, all non-Buddhists do not exceed four types. Explanation: In refuting non-Buddhists, having already separately refuted thirteen non-Buddhist doctrinal teachings above, the second section below generally categorizes them into four types... Treatise: First, those who cling to existence, this is Sāṃkhya. Treatise: Second, those who cling to existence, Vaiśeṣika, etc. Treatise: Third, those who cling to existence, this is the Nirgrantha, now translated as 'Liberated-from-Bonds,' also called 'shameless,' meaning without shame. They are liberated from the bonds of the three realms. Because of their nakedness, the Buddha-dharma condemns them as 'shameless,' meaning without shame or embarrassment."

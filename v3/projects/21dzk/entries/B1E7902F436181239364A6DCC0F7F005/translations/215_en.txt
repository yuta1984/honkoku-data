The treatise states: "First, those who cling to existence, such as wrong livelihood, etc." This refers to the Ājīvika non-Buddhists. It should correspond to "right livelihood," but because the Buddha-dharma condemns them, they are called "wrong livelihood" or "evil livelihood."

The *Brahmajāla Sūtra Commentary* states in its meaning: "Regarding the six master non-Buddhists, the *Vimalakīrti Sūtra* says:"

1. **Pūraṇa Kāśyapa** (Commentary by Sengzhao states: "Surname Kāśyapa, personal name Pūraṇa. This person arose wrong views, claiming all dharmas have an annihilationist nature, considering the ways of ruler-minister and father-son loyalty and filial piety to be empty and non-existent")

2. **Maskarī Gośālīputra** (Kumārajīva states: "Maskarī is the personal name, Gośālī is his mother's surname. This person's wrong view claims that sentient beings' sins and defilements have neither cause nor condition")

3. **Sañjayin Vairaṭīputra** (Kumārajīva states: "Sañjayin is the personal name, Vairaṭī is the mother's name. Essentially, after long experiencing birth and death through countless kalpas, one finally exhausts the limit of suffering")

4. **Ajita Keśakambala** (Kumārajīva states: "Ajita Keśakambala is the personal name, Keśakambala refers to coarse clothing. This person arose views not calculating causes, wearing coarse clothes, pulling out hair, smoking the nose, etc., taking various ascetic practices as the path. Also claiming that this body suffers, but the next body will have constant pleasure")

5. **Kakuda Kātyāyana** (Kumārajīva states: "A non-Buddhist's name. This person responds to things by arising views. If someone asks 'Does it exist?' he answers 'It exists.' If asked 'Does it not exist?' he answers 'It does not exist.' Also claiming all dharmas both have characteristics and lack characteristics")

6. **Nirgrantha Jñātiputra, etc.** (Kumārajīva states: "Nirgrantha is the personal name, Jñāti is the mother's name. This person arose the view that merit, demerit, suffering, and pleasure all result from past lives and must necessarily be repaid. Even practicing the path now cannot interrupt this")

These six masters all arose wrong views, practiced naked asceticism, and claimed to be omniscient. They are generally similar with minor differences.

Generally there are three types of six masters, totaling eighteen groups. The first claim omniscience, the second attain the five supernatural powers, the third recite the four Vedic scriptures. The six masters described above constitute the first group. The six masters all appeared in India when the Buddha had not yet appeared in the world. The four Vedas are non-Buddhist texts. The eighteen great scriptures refer to the canonical texts studied by these three types of six masters. Three × six = eighteen.

**Fifth: The Sixteen Variant Theories** (*Prakaraṇa* fascicles 9-10, *Yogācārabhūmi* fascicle 6 explain these)

*Yogācārabhūmi* fascicle 6 states: "Clinging to effect existing in cause, manifesting existence of past and future, self-permanent past-action causes, sovereignty and other harmful dharmas, limited-unlimited deceptive theories calculating no-cause annihilation-emptiness, most supreme pure auspiciousness - through sixteen variant theories."

1. **Effect-Existing-in-Cause School** (Held by certain non-Buddhists who cling to fruit-nature constantly existing within the causes of all dharmas. Like grain being the cause of rice - when seeking rice, one plants only grain. Rice definitely arises from grain, not from wheat. Therefore we know grain-causes already contain rice beforehand. Otherwise everything should arise from everything)

2. **Manifestation-from-Conditions School** (Sāṃkhya and Sound theorists. Sāṃkhya masters calculate that all dharma-substances are inherently existent in their essential nature, manifested from assembled conditions, not produced by conditions. If not manifested by conditions, being originally existent yet again arising from causes would not accord with principle. Sound theorists hold that sound-substance is permanent, characteristics originally existent, without birth or destruction, yet manifested through repeated utterance)

3. **Past-Future Real-Existence School** (Vaiśeṣika non-Buddhists and time-calculating non-Buddhists also make this calculation. Past and future worlds exist, really existent like the present world, not provisional. Though this extends to Hinayāna, here we take only the non-Buddhist position)

4. **Calculating-Self Real-Existence School** (Beast-masters and all other non-Buddhists make this theory, calculating there is a self, there are sattvas, there are living beings, etc. Through arising the five consciousnesses, they know there is a self. That is, the sattva-consciousness when seeing form, etc.)

5. **All-Dharmas-Permanent School** (Īśvara non-Buddhists calculate that self and world are all permanently abiding. They calculate complete permanence, partial permanence, etc. Atomic permanence, etc., are also included in this)

**Left Page**

6. **All-Causes-Past-Actions School** (Nirgrantha kinsmen, also called shameless non-Buddhists. Currently experienced suffering all results from past actions as causes. If one makes present effort, one expels old karma. Through not being harmed by non-action-creation, thus afterward there are no more outflows)

7. **Sovereignty-and-Other-Causes School** (Those calculating unequal causes, following what they serve, take that as the name. Like Maheśvara, etc. Some cling to all dharmas being transformations of Maheśvara Deva, some being transformations of great beings, some being transformations of Mahābrahmā, some taking time, direction, space, self, etc., as causes)

8. **Harm-as-Correct-Dharma School** (Brahmins of the pure-intention kalpa-arising, wanting to eat meat, falsely arose this calculation. If for sacrificial rituals and spells, first harming various living beings, those who sacrifice, those harmed, and assistants all attain rebirth in heaven. *General Analysis Chapter* Zhou commentary states: "Chapter contention-competition initial arising, etc., means the end of formation kalpas and beginning of abiding kalpas is called contention-competition. Their intention considers this great earth as a merit field, wanting to block donations, because depending on this field for sacrifices, therefore those who harm and are harmed plus assistants can generate heavenly rebirth, etc.")

9. **Pervasive-Limitless-etc. School** (Non-Buddhists who attained mundane meditative absorptions regarding limitless-unlimited, dwelling in limited-unlimited characteristics, calculating that world is limited, unlimited, both, neither, etc.)

10. **Undying-Deception School** (Undying-deception non-Buddhists. See the section on four undying deceptions among the sixty-two views)

11. **All-Dharmas-Causeless School** (Causeless non-Buddhists calculating that self and world arise causelessly)

12. **Matter-Annihilation School** (Annihilationist non-Buddhists calculating seven annihilations. See the above section on seven annihilation theories)

13. **Cause-Effect-Both-Empty School** (Wrong-view non-Buddhists calculating there is no loving care, etc. Seeing those who practice good conversely born in evil destinies, seeing those who practice evil born in good destinies, they claim this is emptiness. Or generally slandering and rejecting all as empty)

14. **Falsely-Calculating-Most-Supreme School** (Brahmins of contention kalpas explaining that Brahmins are the most supreme caste, born from Brahmā's mouth, while others are inferior, not sons of Brahmā. *General Analysis Chapter* Zhou commentary: "Contention kalpa arising, etc., means the end of formation kalpas and beginning of abiding kalpas is called contention-competition")

15. **Falsely-Calculating-Purity School** (Present-dharma-nirvāṇa non-Buddhists and water-etc.-purity non-Buddhists who firmly cling to and enjoy the subtle five desires of various heavens, calling this attaining present-dharma-nirvāṇa. Up to extensive explanation. Maintaining cow-dog precepts is also like this. See the matter of cow-dog precepts. Drawing inferences from faith, etc.)

16. **Falsely-Calculating-Auspiciousness School** (Calendar-calculation non-Buddhists claiming that if there are solar-lunar eclipses, stellar irregularities, etc., following the sun and moon all desires will be fulfilled, one should diligently make offerings to sun, moon, stars, etc. Up to extensive explanation, as that treatise explains)

*Prakaraṇa Treatise*'s sixteen variant theories all place the character "treatise" - namely Effect-in-Cause Treatise up to Falsely-Calculating-Auspiciousness Treatise. The above sixteen treatises should be seen in the Analysis Chapter.

**Sixth: Clarifying that Non-Buddhists Have Six Categories** (Their doctrinal substances are also different)

1. **Sāṃkhya** (appeared at kalpa-formation beginning)
2. **Vaiśeṣika** (appeared at kalpa-formation end)  
3. **Treatise on Clarity** (fully called Sound-Clarity Treatise masters. When kalpas initially arose, Brahmā first composed ten thousand verses)
4. **Sound Treatise**
5. **Sound-Generation Treatise**
6. **Conforming-to-World Treatise**

The explanation states: Sāṃkhya establishes two types of doctrinal substance. First, the root doctrinal substance takes the three guṇas of prakṛti as its substance - this is permanent. Second, branch doctrinal dharmas take sound among the five matters as substance - this is impermanent, transformational. Transformation is not destruction; when destroyed, it returns to the root. Vaiśeṣika masters take sound among various qualities as doctrinal substance - impermanent and unobstructed. This is destructive impermanence, not transformational. Treatise-on-Clarity practitioners are Brahmins, etc., who cling to the four Veda treatises, holding sound as solely permanent, taking this as doctrinal substance, not taking sound-nature because it is not capable of designation. That designating sound designates the meanings designated in the Treatise on Clarity.

**Second: Clarifying the Three Types of Establishment** (This is explained in *Prakaraṇāryavāca*, fascicle 5)

1. **Defiled Establishment** (afflictions and secondary afflictions)
2. **Pure Establishment** (wholesome dharmas such as faith)  
3. **Positional Establishment** (dharmas not associated with mind)

**Third: Various Names for Wisdom**

The *Lotus Sūtra* (*Parable* chapter) states: "All-knowledge, natural wisdom, teacherless wisdom." The *Entrustment* chapter states: "Buddha's wisdom, Tathāgata wisdom, natural wisdom."

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra* states: "All-knowledge, all-aspect knowledge, path-aspect knowledge, all-characteristic knowledge." The commentary explains: "The wisdom that observes emptiness is called all-knowledge. This is fundamental wisdom (*mūlajñāna*). Among the wisdoms that observe existence, there are two types: one observes the uncontaminated path, and two observes all other characteristics. 'Characteristics' means distinctive features and differential characteristics. This is subsequently-attained wisdom (*pṛṣṭhalabdhajñāna*). This wisdom's observation of the uncontaminated path is called path-aspect knowledge, and its observation of other dharmas is called all-characteristic knowledge. Since they are divided into two, all-knowledge is fundamental wisdom, and all-aspect knowledge is subsequently-attained wisdom" (This is the meaning of the *Adhyāśayasaṃcodana Commentary*).

The *Lotus Sūtra Profound Praise* fascicle 5 (on the *Parable* chapter) states: "All-knowledge is the wisdom that observes emptiness, which the three vehicles possess in common. Buddha-wisdom is wisdom concerning phenomena, which only the Buddha uniquely accomplishes. Natural wisdom arises through self-awakening. Therefore know that the initial all-knowledge consists of fundamental wisdom and subsequently-attained wisdom. Teacherless wisdom is accomplished without depending on other conditions, therefore it is called teacherless wisdom. Alternatively, the wisdom-nature is called natural wisdom, and the wisdom-characteristics are called teacherless wisdom."

The same work, fascicle 10 (on the *Entrustment* chapter) states: "Buddha's wisdom is aspect-knowledge. Tathāgata wisdom is all-knowledge. These two are obtained spontaneously without a teacher, hence called natural wisdom. Alternatively, the former two wisdoms are conditioned wisdom, while the latter one is unconditioned wisdom, called natural wisdom."

The same work, fascicle 4, states: "Regarding the sūtra passage 'these sentient beings... to all aspects,' 'reaching all aspects' refers to the Buddha's correct wisdom, which through aspectual distinctions can know all dharmas. This is precisely the ox-cart."

The *Golden Light Sūtra* fascicle 3 (*Eliminating Obstacles* chapter) states: "All-knowledge, pure wisdom, inconceivable wisdom, immovable wisdom, *samyaksaṃbodhi* correct universal wisdom." The commentary on the same, fascicle 3, states: "The first four wisdoms name the wisdom-nature as wisdom, while from *samyaksaṃbodhi* onward they name the wisdom-characteristics as wisdom. All-knowledge is what fundamental wisdom realizes. Repeating 'wisdom' refers to what the wisdom-nature realizes. The meaning clarifies that wisdom-nature is fundamental. This wisdom is called pure wisdom because it is free from the two obstructions. It is called inconceivable because it cannot be known by others. It is called immovable because it is free from arising and ceasing. This corresponds to *anuttara*. *Samyak*, etc., are as commonly explained. Furthermore, they may be correlated with the four wisdom categories in terms of general and particular. All-knowledge and wisdom generally accord with what the *Mahāalaṃkāra Treatise* fascicle 3 explains. Pure wisdom is observational, obtained through transforming the five consciousnesses. It can teach the Dharma to great assemblies, eliminate doubts, rain great Dharma rain, and purify others, hence called pure wisdom. Inconceivable refers to accomplishment wisdom, obtained through transforming the sixth consciousness. In all worlds it creates various transformative activities, immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable. Immovable wisdom is great perfect mirror wisdom, obtained through transforming the eighth consciousness. That mirror wisdom has immovability as its characteristic and constantly serves as the basis for the other three wisdoms. Immovable means continuous uniformity, meaning only equanimous sensation. *Samyak*, etc., refers to equality wisdom obtained through transforming the seventh consciousness. If one cultivates this wisdom to utmost purity, one immediately attains supreme enlightenment. Because there is no ultimate end, due to the inexhaustibility of sentient beings there is no ultimate end. The latter 'correct universal wisdom' is expressed in both Chinese and Sanskrit."

*Samyak*, etc., is Sanskrit; correct universal wisdom is Chinese.

*Profound Praise* fascicle 3 states: "What the treatise calls wisdom refers to all-aspects and all-knowledge wisdom. The wisdom of the all-knowledge person is called all-knowledge wisdom. Its substance encompasses both essence and characteristics, hence called all-aspects. This is the nirvāṇa and bodhi of the Buddha's fruition stage. Alternatively, all-knowledge is non-discriminating wisdom; repeating 'wisdom' means subsequently-attained wisdom. 'Meaning' refers to objects. Since it is the object of all-knowledge wisdom, it is called all-knowledge wisdom meaning. What is called that object? It is called all-aspects. All-aspects refers to emptiness or existence, conditioned or unconditioned, contaminated or uncontaminated, teaching or principle—these are called all-aspects. 'Aspects' means categories. The categories of dharma-substances are numerous and not singular. Encompassing everything completely is called all-aspects. These all-aspects are the objects of all-knowledge."

Further below it states: "Wisdom has five aspects that encompass all dharmas completely, hence called all-aspects: 1. All wisdom-essence, meaning suchness. 2. Wisdom-characteristics, having the two wisdoms of uncontaminated observation—fundamental wisdom and subsequently-attained wisdom—as substance. 3. Wisdom-accompaniments, meaning the countless merits and conditioned virtuous qualities. 4. Wisdom-causes, meaning teachings and myriad practices. 5. Wisdom-objects, meaning emptiness or existence, conditioned or unconditioned, the objects of conventional and ultimate truth." The commentary texts from various places should be carefully examined and analyzed together. Each doctrinal approach has its particular perspective, therefore they do not contradict each other.

The *Supreme Victory Commentary* fascicle 1 states: "Attaining *sarvajñajñāna* is called all-aspect knowledge. 'Aspects' means categories. Emptiness or existence, principle or phenomena are called all-aspects. Comprehending all of these is called all-aspect knowledge. This is a dependent-head compound (*tatpuruṣa*). 'All-aspects' is an objective case."

*Mahāprajñāpāramitā* fascicle 7 (first bundle) states: "All-knowledge, path-aspect knowledge, all-characteristic knowledge, all-characteristic subtle wisdom." The same work, thirtieth bundle, fascicle 7, states: "Perfect awakening is the characteristic of all-knowledge. Good penetration is the characteristic of path-aspect knowledge. Manifest distinct awakening is the characteristic of all-knowledge." The *Pronunciation Guide* fascicle 1 states: "All-knowledge (shared with the three vehicles), path-aspect knowledge (wisdom shared with bodhisattvas), all-characteristic subtle wisdom (exclusive Buddha-wisdom)."

*Abhidharmasamuccaya* fascicle 4 states: "Non-contention wisdom, aspiration wisdom." Non-contention wisdom (also called non-contention samādhi—non-contention associated with wisdom): "Depending on tranquil meditation, among the complete equipment for protecting others from afflictions they should generate, it refers to concentration or wisdom and their associated mental factors. Why is this so? Because it can protect others from various afflictive truths, it is called non-contention." Aspiration wisdom: "Depending on tranquil meditation, among the complete equipment for understanding what should be known through aspiration, it refers to concentration or wisdom. Why is this so? In order to understand the knowable matters of past, present, and future, one first develops correct aspiration regarding those matters: 'I will understand truly.' Then one enters superior meditation, and after emerging from it, the aspiration is fulfilled—one is able to understand what should be known" (Depending on the four meditations, superior to the fourth ground).

The *Adhyāśayasaṃcodana Commentary* states: "Because dharma-nature and dharma-characteristics are not shared in substance, like the sharpness of a blade having no separate substance. Therefore through this we know that each moment is fundamentally also the all-knowledge wisdom of all Buddhas. There are multiple explanations for this. True wisdom and conventional wisdom each obtain one designation. The second explanation says all-knowledge refers to the Buddha. Moreover, saying 'wisdom' refers to the wisdom accomplished by the Buddha. This foundation is *prajñā*, precisely the Buddha's wisdom. Taking anger as suchness, one also attains the Buddha's wisdom. The nature of afflictions is precisely the factors of awakening, with no further loss."

The *Humane King Sūtra*, *Bodhisattva Teaching* chapter states: "If bodhisattvas, through skillful wisdom and aspiration wisdom, transform...

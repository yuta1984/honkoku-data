**Section 26: Clarifying the Four Lords**

*Records of the Western Regions* fascicle 1 states: The land of Jambudvīpa has four lords. The southern Elephant Lord has hot and humid conditions suitable for elephants. The western Treasure Lord borders the sea and is full of treasures. The northern Horse Lord has cold and vigorous conditions suitable for horses. The eastern Human Lord is harmonious and abundant with many people.

**Section 27: Clarifying the Five Musical Sounds** (also called Five Voice Music)

1. Shang (Zhang - metal element. When things are accomplished, they can be measured).
2. Jiao (Touch - wood element. Things touch the ground and emerge, bearing pointed horns).
3. Gong (Center - earth element. Dwelling in the center, extending to the four directions, beginning song and bestowing life, becoming the framework for the four sounds).
4. Zhi (Blessing - fire element. Things are refreshing and greatly mysterious).
5. Yu (Universe - water element. Things are covered and stored, covered by the universe).

These are also matched to five types of people (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).

The above are the five musical sounds (see *Xuanzan* fascicle 4, *Shōshaku* fascicle 3).

*Saishō* Master Gyōkō's commentary fascicle 5 (Sarasvatī chapter) states: The five sounds refer to drums, stone chimes, flutes, zheng, qin, and se instruments. Gong, shang, jiao, zhi, and yu all derive from these. *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sound Training* fascicle 3 states: The five branches refer to strings, wind instruments, drums, song, and dance - these are called the five-branch music.

Tang Dynasty Great Monastic Administrator Hōshin's *Saishō Sound Meanings* middle fascicle states (Great Sarasvatī chapter): The five musical sounds: 1. Metal music refers to bells and chimes. 2. Stone music refers to stone chimes. 3. Silk music refers to qin and se. 4. Bamboo music refers to sheng and flutes.

5. Gourd music refers to the konghou harp. *Suvarṇaprabhāsa-sūtra* fascicle 7 states: The sounds of the five musical tones never cease.

**The Eight Musical Sounds are:**

Metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, clay, leather, and wood.

*Sukhāvatīvyūha-sūtra* upper fascicle states: Producing five sounds, subtle gong and shang naturally harmonize. *Xuanzan* fascicle 4 states: Music is the general term for five sounds and eight sounds. The same *Xuanzan* fascicle 4 states: In the Yellow Emperor's era, Linglun created music (see *Shōshaku* fascicle 3 for details).

**Section 28: Clarifying the Four Seasons** (the four seasons, also called four sequences)

*Suvarṇaprabhāsa-sūtra* fascicle 9 states: Three months constitute spring time. Three months are called summer. Three months are called autumn division. Three months are called winter time. This is based on dividing the year into groups of three and explaining them separately. The same sūtra's commentary states: "Explaining separately" means three months and three months form one season, concluding the previous four seasons.

Time and seasons have the same substance but different names. *Saishō Sound Meanings* ends here.

**The Six Seasons are:**

Flower time (first two months), hot season (third and fourth months), rain (fifth and sixth months), autumn time (seventh and eighth months), cold time (ninth and tenth months), water time (last two months).

*Suvarṇaprabhāsa-sūtra* fascicle 9 states: Two by two make one season, forming six seasons in a year. The first two are flower time. The third and fourth are called hot season. The fifth and sixth are called rain season. The seventh and eighth are called autumn time. The ninth and tenth are cold

time. The last two are called ice and snow.

The same sūtra's commentary states: "Two by two make one season" means two months and two months form one season, indicating the following six seasons (one season is sixty days each, six times six is thirty-six days).

**The Three Seasons are:**

Hot, cold, and rain. A verse states: "Cold, hot, rain seasons." The verse commentary has "cold, hot, rain." The eleven-fascicle verse commentary has "hot, cold, rain." The twelve-fascicle original verse and commentary have "cold, hot, rain." According to Western countries' custom, they divide twelve months into three seasons: hot, cold, and rain, each having four months. Masters Tai and Kō similarly match the three seasons to months and days and times in the sequence hot-rain-cold. However, the sequences described in the three sources differ. Specifically, the eleven-fascicle verse commentary generally indicates "hot, cold, rain" but specifically explains "hot, rain, cold." The twelve-fascicle verse commentary has "cold, hot, rain."

**Four Seasons and Eight Divisions:**

The four seasons are the four quarters (as usual). The eight divisions follow popular tradition. The eight divisions mean dividing each of the four seasons into two. Using forty-five days as one division: four times eight equals thirty-two (320 days). Five times eight equals forty (40 days). Combining the eight divisions makes 360 days in one year. *Suvarṇaprabhāsa-sūtra Sound Meanings* states:

The sūtra says two by two make one season. One season is sixty days. One year has twelve months, forming six seasons in a year. Time and seasons have the same substance but different names. In popular usage, they say one year has four seasons and eight divisions. The four seasons are spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The eight divisions: one division is forty-five days, eight divisions combined have 360 days, making one year. *Wenyi Collection Commentary* states: The four seasons and eight divisions are spiritual. Composed by Du Hong of Nanyang, Governor of Xinzhou.

**Section 29: Clarifying the Eight Times of Falling**

Explaining "randomly falling eight" in *Asaṅga's Compendium Treatise* has four meanings: 1. Eight times of day and night. 2. Eight assemblies and eight times as explained in *Avataṃsaka*. 3. The time when eight declensions indicate all dharmas. 4. The time of randomly falling desires.

Master Giin's interpretation uses the meaning of desire-time as correct. *Enshū's* interpretation preserves two meanings: eight declensions eight times and falling desire-time. Master Shū's record takes three meanings: *Avataṃsaka's* eight assembly times, eight declension sound times, and day-night eight times, but raises objections to the desire-time meaning and doesn't accept it. *Shōshaku's* interpretation takes day-night time and eight declension eight times. *Muryōgikyō Commentary* fascicle 1 has three meanings: 1. Day-night eight times, 2. Eight declension times, 3. *Avataṃsaka's* eight assembly eight times. (See *Enshū*, *Shōshaku*, *Shūki*, *Giin* for details).

The author doesn't know, but a private chapter record briefly states: *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* says "randomly falling eight times" is direct and indirect teaching. What are those eight times? Answer: Excluding the four times of yin, mao, shen, and you, the remaining eight times. Question: Why exclude those four times? Answer: Because summer and winter are indefinite, they are excluded. However, I haven't seen the original text. Great Virtue Myōsen says: They use popular convention - chen, si, wu, wei, xu, hai, zi, chou - four daytime hours and four nighttime hours.

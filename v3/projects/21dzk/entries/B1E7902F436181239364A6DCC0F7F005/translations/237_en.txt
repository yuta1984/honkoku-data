3. Cannot conceive themselves but can cause others to conceive. All are difficult to classify. *Vinaya in Four Parts, Six Fascicles Excerpt* fascicle 2 states: Five types of eunuchs.

**Section 19: Clarifying the Five Categories [of Precept Violations]**

1. Pārājika (translated as "defeated by others" or "fallen to an inferior state" - the four pārājika offenses are as clarified in the first volume of Miscellaneous Dharma Gates). 2. Saṅghāvaśeṣa (translated as "remainder of the community"). 3. Pāyattika (translated as "downfall," also called "burning fire"). 4. Prātideśanīya (translated as "confession toward another"). 5. Śaikṣa-dharma (translated as "should be learned" - see *Shōshaku* fascicle 2, the section on sixty sentient beings above).

**Section 21: Clarifying King Kṛki's Ten Dreams**

When the Bodhisattva is in the intermediate existence, he is like one in the prime of life, with perfect form possessing all the marks and characteristics. While dwelling in the intermediate existence about to enter the womb, he illuminates hundreds of koṭis of the four great continents. If so, why did the Bodhisattva's mother dream of a white elephant calf entering her right side? Answer: This is an auspicious sign, not related to the intermediate existence. The Bodhisattva long ago abandoned rebirth destinies, like the ten things King Kṛki saw in his dreams (King Kṛki is translated as "King of Actions").

The verse states: "The great elephant, well, parched grain, sandalwood, wondrous garden, small elephant, two monkeys, wide sturdy cloth, and fighting." Such dreams merely indicate omens of future events, not what was actually seen.

Explanation: King Kṛki was the father of Kāśyapa Buddha. Having these ten dreams, he reported to the World-Honored One. The Buddha said: "These indicate omens of the disciples of Śākyamuni Tathāgata's remaining teachings in the future."

The king dreamed of a great elephant trapped in a room with no doors, only a small window. The elephant managed to get its body out through ingenuity, but its tail was still obstructed by the window and could not emerge. This represents how Śākyamuni's future Dharma disciples can abandon parents, wives, and children to become monks, yet still harbor thoughts of fame and profit within, like the tail obstructed by the window.

The king dreamed of a thirsty person seeking water. There was a well with eight excellent qualities, but the well followed the thirsty person saying it didn't want to be drunk from. This represents how Śākyamuni's future Dharma disciples - monastics and laypeople - refuse to study the Dharma, and even when there are those who know the Dharma, they teach for fame and profit, yet people still do not awaken.

Also dreamed of someone trading a peck of pearls for a peck of parched grain. This represents how Śākyamuni's future Dharma disciples will teach Buddha's true Dharma to others for the sake of profit.

Also dreamed of someone trading sandalwood for common wood. This represents how future Dharma disciples will trade inner true Dharma for external books and classics.

Also dreamed of a beautiful garden with flourishing flowers and fruits being completely destroyed by mad bandits. This represents how future Dharma disciples will extensively destroy the Tathāgata's true Dharma garden.

Also dreamed of many small elephants driving out one great elephant from the herd. This represents how future Dharma disciples in various factions will extensively break the precepts of the monastic community and expel virtuous people.

Also dreamed of a monkey smearing its body with filth and approaching a crowd, with everyone avoiding it. This represents how future Dharma disciples will use various evil deeds to slander good people, causing all who see to avoid them from afar.

Also dreamed of a monkey with no virtue being supported by the crowd, anointed on the head with seawater, and established as king. This represents how future Dharma disciples in evil factions will elevate precept-breaking monks to be community leaders.

Also dreamed of a sturdy, wide cloth with eight people each grasping a portion, pulling from four sides in争ute, yet the cloth did not tear. This represents how future Dharma disciples will divide Buddha's true Dharma into eighteen schools, and though there may be slight differences, if they maintain the true Dharma,

by practicing according to it, all can attain liberation. Also dreamed of many people gathering together to attack each other, dying and being completely exhausted. This represents how within the eighteen schools of future Dharma disciples, each will have followers, with different sectarian positions leading to mutual conflicts.

These are called the ten dreams, merely indicating omens, as seen. The Bodhisattva's mother dreaming of a white elephant is an auspicious foretoken, not an actual white elephant.

**Section 22: Clarifying the Ten Types of Merit for Those Who Uphold the Mahāyāna**

1. Accomplishing all bodhicitta seeds. 2. Attaining complete joy and bliss at the time of death. 3. Attaining birth as desired in all places. 4. Attaining inherent mindfulness and ten wisdoms in all places of birth. 5. Always encountering buddhas wherever born. 6. Constantly being near buddhas and hearing Mahāyāna teachings. 7. Accomplishing superior faith faculties. 8. Accomplishing superior wisdom faculties. 9. Attaining separation from the two obstacles of afflictions and knowledge. 10. Quickly accomplishing unsurpassed bodhi. Through this, one avoids the eight difficulties. See *Saishō-sho* fascicle 3, Three Bodies chapter.

*Alaṃkāra-śāstra* fascicle 6, Propagating Dharma, states: If a person properly and diligently upholds even one sentence of any Mahāyāna scripture, whether in text or meaning, they will attain these ten types of merit. It should be understood that in the present world one attains the first two types of merit, and in future worlds one attains the remaining eight types of merit, gradually increasing in excellence.

**Section 23: Clarifying the Eight Fields of Merit**

1. Creating beautiful wells in wilderness. 2. Waterways and bridges. 3. Leveling dangerous roads. 4. Caring for parents with filial piety. 5. Making offerings to śramaṇas. 6. Making offerings to the sick. 7. Rescuing from disasters and difficulties. 8. Unrestricted food offerings.

*Brahmajāla-sūtra* Taehyeon Ancient Traces, lower fascicle, states: Regarding the eight fields of merit, some say (as above). Dharma Treasury Master states: "I have not seen this in sacred teachings. My interpretation: 1. Buddha, 2. Noble persons, 3. Preceptor, 4. Teacher, 5. Monastic community, 6. Father, 7. Mother, 8. Sick persons. How do we know this? Because the text below states 'the eight fields of merit: all buddhas, noble persons, each teacher and monk, father, mother, sick person.'"

*Brahmajāla-sūtra* lower fascicle states: "Among the eight fields of merit: all buddhas, noble persons, each teacher and monk, father, mother, sick person." The same sūtra's commentary, lower fascicle, states: "The eight merits are: 1. Buddha, 2. Noble persons, 3. Preceptor, 4. Ācārya, 5. Monks, 6. Father, 7. Mother, 8. Sick persons."

**Section 24: Clarifying the Three Fields of Merit**

1. Field of Reverence (respectfully honoring the Three Jewels and elderly superiors). 2. Field of Kindness (knowing and repaying kindness). 3. Field of Compassion (generating loving-kindness and compassion for the poor, sick, and those with disabilities).

See *Upajanma-sūtra Commentary*.

**Section 25: Clarifying the Four Kindnesses of the World**

1. Parental kindness. 2. Sentient beings' kindness. 3. Ruler's kindness. 4. Three Jewels' kindness.

*Kṣitigarbha-sūtra* fascicle 2, Repaying Kindness chapter, states: "There are four types of worldly kindness: 1. Parental kindness... Thus these four kindnesses are equally borne by all sentient beings."

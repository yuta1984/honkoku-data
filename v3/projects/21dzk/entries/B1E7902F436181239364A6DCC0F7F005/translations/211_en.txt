1. **Dharma-nature Establishing School** (*Zaxin lun* [Saṃyuktābhidharmahṛdaya] and others. This school establishes that the five aggregates of form, etc., all possess substantial nature. This represents the position of the Sarvāstivāda, etc.).

2. **Nature-Breaking School** (*Chengshi lun* [Tattvasiddhi]. This breaks the substantial existence of dharmas, holding that only characteristics exist).

3. **Characteristic-Breaking School** (*Prajñāpāramitā* sūtras, etc. This breaks the characteristics and forms of dharmas, also establishing emptiness. This includes the *Madhyamaka* and *Śataśāstra*, etc.).

4. **Reality-Revealing School** (*Nirvāṇa Sūtra*, *Lotus Sūtra*, *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, etc. This reveals the meaning of true reality and the Middle Way, abandoning the provisional city to return to true meaning).

One should consult the *Two Truths Chapter*, *General Brief*, *Xuanzan* fascicle 1, *Tongzan Commentary* upper fascicle, and *Vimalakīrti Commentary* fascicle 1.

The *Yaoji* fascicle 5 explains that "ancient masters' general classification" refers to describing different ways of classifying teachings in ancient times. The ancient master was Dharma Master Yuan of the Zhou period, who remonstrated against Emperor Wu of Zhou's destruction of Buddhism. He was nine feet tall and wore a wide skirt. He classified the Buddha's lifetime teachings into four schools.

The text continues with detailed explanations of each school, including their philosophical positions on the nature of dharmas, the relationship between substance and characteristics, and their approaches to ultimate reality.

**Eight Schools:**

1. **Both Self and Dharmas Exist School** (Vātsīputrīya, etc.)
2. **Dharmas Exist, No Self School** (Sarvāstivāda, etc.)  
3. **No Past-Future Dharmas School** (Mahāsāṃghika, etc.)
4. **Present Encompasses Provisional and Real School** (Prajñaptivāda, etc.)
5. **Conventional is False, True is Real School** (Lokottaravāda, etc.)
6. **All Dharmas are Merely Names School** (Ekavyavahārika, etc.)
7. **Ultimate Meaning is All Empty School** (Prajñāpāramitā, Nāgārjuna, Bhāviveka, etc.)
8. **Logically Perfect Complete Reality School** (Avataṃsaka, Lotus, Saṃdhinirmocana sūtras and Asaṅga, Dharmapāla, etc.)

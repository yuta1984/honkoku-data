1. Kauṇḍinya. 2. Daśabala-Kāśyapa. The above two were maternal relatives of the uncle's family who favored pleasant practices.
3. Aśvajit (called "Horse-Victor." His appearance was gentle and elegant, and he could skillfully tame horses, hence he was named following this metaphor).
4. Bhadrika. 5. Mahānāman-Kulika. The above three were paternal family brothers who favored ascetic practices.

The first, Kauṇḍinya (also called Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya, Liaobenjì, Jie-wuzhi, and also Ruòjiāo-chénrú. See *Shōshō Commentary* and *Hokke Genshin* fascicle 4).

*Vajracchedikā Commentary* states: "When the Buddha first attained enlightenment in the first period, he liberated the five kulin."

*Tsūsan* fascicle 1 states: "Fifty years after the Buddha first attained enlightenment, he liberated the five kurin." *Suvarṇaprabhāsa-sūtra* fascicle 1 states: "Their names were Venerable Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya, Venerable Aśvasena, Venerable Vāṣpa, Venerable Mahānāman, and Venerable Bhadrika." The same commentary fascicle 1 states: "Regarding the sūtra passage 'Their names were... up to Bhadrika,' the commentary says: This lists the names afterward. There are two parts: first listing the arhatship attainers, then separately listing the stream-entrants. Among those listed as arhatship attainers, there are eleven people. The order of names listed in various sūtras is not fixed. This mostly follows the order of ordination, as explained in the *Baoen-jing*. These are the first five monks. The causes and conditions of their earlier liberation and the explanation of Chénrú's name are as in the *Original Lotus Commentary*. 'Venerable' means possessing both merit-life and wisdom-life. However, old translators mostly said 'wisdom-life.' Now to show the dual accomplishment, we say 'venerable.' Aśvasena means 'horse' (aśva) and 'victory' (sena), also called Aśvabhadra. This is the formerly mentioned Horse-Victor monk. Vāṣpa means 'breath.' Mahānāman means 'Great Name' - he was the second son of King Amṛtodana. The king had two sons: one named Aniruddha, the second named Mahānāman. Bhadrika means 'Good and Worthy' (the *Dual Contemplation Sūtra* calls him 'Benevolent and Worthy' with the same meaning). He was the second son of King Śuklodana.

The king had two sons: one named Nandika, the second named Bhadrika." *Genshin* fascicle 4 states: "The five people are: 1. Chénrú, 2. Daśabala-Kāśyapa, 3. È[?] (some say this is the Horse-Victor monk), 4. Bhadrika, 5. Mahānāman-Kulika. One should examine the *Vibhāṣā*."

The causes and conditions for first liberating the five people are of four types (see *Genshin* fascicle 4). The same *Shōshaku* fascicle 3 states: "Regarding the commentary's 'traditionally transmitted five people,' examining now, *Buddha's Original Acts Sūtra* fascicle 34 says: 1. Chénrú, 2. Bhadrika (meaning 'Minor Worthy'), 3. Vāṣpa (meaning 'Arising Breath'), 4. Mahānāman (meaning 'Great Name'), 5. Aśvayuji (meaning 'Horse-Tamer') (see *Genshin* fascicle 4 and *Shōshō Sūtra* upper fascicle)."

*Genshin* fascicle 1 states: "*Amitāyus-sūtra's* 'Liaobenjì' refers to Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya. In Sanskrit, Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya. This is a Brahman family name. 'Na' is the masculine ending. Ājñāta means 'understanding' - because he first awakened to understanding... After the prince escaped over the city walls, the father-king commanded inner and outer relatives, totaling five people, to guard the prince. The five people then engaged in practicing ascetic and pleasant practices as the Way. The prince tested and examined, following various non-Buddhist teachings to practice ascetic and pleasant practices, but surpassing those practices, all were not true methods. He abandoned eating milk-rice, accepted auspicious grass, and after attaining enlightenment under the bodhi tree, went to Deer Park to liberate these five people and first turned the Dharma Wheel. When the Buddha asked 'Do you understand?', among the five people Chénná first replied 'I now understand.' The pure-dwelling gods also said 'already understood.' Thus this became his name, called 'First Understanding.' Kauṇḍinya is the surname. For the many, understanding was used to mark the name. Na is the masculine ending, using masculine to distinguish from feminine. Therefore later the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* says 'Jie-Kauṇḍinya' (see *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sound Training* fascicle 4)." *Lotus Sound Training* states:

"Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya (Sanskrit Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya. Ājñāta means understanding - because he first understood the Dharma. Kauṇḍinya is a Brahman surname. Na is the masculine ending. One must follow the father's surname. New translation sūtras say 'Jie-Kauṇḍinya')." *Anantanirdeśa-sūtra* Dharma Teaching chapter states: "Good son, I arose from the tree king... for Ājñāta-kulin and the other five people, I turned the Four Noble Truths Dharma Wheel." Gyōkō's *Eight-fascicle Suvarṇaprabhāsa Commentary* fascicle 2 states: "Fourth, the surname Kauṇḍinya means 'fire vessel.' Originally dwelling in non-Buddhist teachings, serving fire as practice, because fire was in the heart."

(This refers to the Brahman Kauṇḍinya, not the monk Chénrú.)

**Section 31: Clarifying the Hundred Merit Adornments**

Each of the ten wholesome karmic paths has five types of mind, thus forming fifty intentions (initial aspiration). When perfectly fulfilled, they become fifty minds - this is satisfaction. Therefore, they are called hundred merits. *Yogācārabhūmi* fascicle 53 explains hundred practices regarding the ten wholesome karmic paths (should be examined). *Shōshaku* fascicle 4 states: "Regarding the commentary's 'hundred merits felt from ten wholesome causes,' examining the *Nirvāṇa-sūtra* fascicle 24: 'The bodhisattva's precept of not killing has five types of mind: lower, middle, upper, upper-middle, and supreme, and likewise up to right view. These fifty minds are called initial aspiration. With complete determination becoming fifty minds, this is called satisfaction. Such hundred minds are called hundred merit-virtues. Perfecting hundred merits accomplishes one characteristic.'" *Genshin* fascicle 10 states: "Also, hundred merits refers to fruits felt from ten wholesome causes." *Abhidharmakośa Verse Commentary* fascicle 18 states: "Each adorned by hundred merits: the karma of the thirty-two characteristics is each adorned by hundred merits. A hundred wholesome intentions each become hundred merits. Like when cultivating the characteristic of flat and full soles: first arise fifty intentions to cultivate and purify the bodily vessel, then arise one intention to properly

draw it forth, then arise fifty intentions to make it perfect. Like a farmer first preparing the furrows, then sowing seeds, then covering and irrigating with fertilizer and water. Cultivating the feet being thus, other characteristics are likewise. Fifty intentions means the ten wholesome paths each have five intentions. The first not-killing karma having five intentions: 1. Intention to abstain from killing, 2. Encouraging intention, 3. Praising intention, 4. Rejoicing intention, 5. Dedicating merit intention. Up to right view should be understood likewise. These are called fifty intentions. Question: Why is it called 'one merit measure'? Answer: Some say: excluding near-Buddha bodhisattvas, all other sentient beings' wealth and happiness karma is called one merit measure. Some say: karma that brings about a great thousand-world system is one merit measure. Some say: the measure has no limits - only Buddha can know."

**Section 32: Clarifying the Hundred Grains** (grain means continuation)

Types of millet and sorghum, types of rice glutinous and non-glutinous, types of various beans. These three grain types each have twenty varieties, totaling sixty. Vegetables and fruits in two categories assist grains with twenty each, altogether making hundred grains.

*Genshin* fascicle 7 states: "Hundred grains - grain means continuation. Yang Quan's *Physics Treatise* says: 'Liang is the general name for millet and sorghum. Rice is the general name for glutinous and non-glutinous rice. Ji is the general name for various beans. The three grains each have twenty, totaling sixty. Vegetables and fruits assist grains with twenty each, altogether making hundred grains.' Therefore the *Poetry* says: 'Sow those hundred grains.' *I Ching*: 'Hundred grains are beautiful on earth.' The three things - hundred grains, sugarcane, and peaches - metaphorically represent the middle and great plants. The three vehicles have seed-natures. The great two plants and three karmas have seed-natures (the ten characters from 'great two' onward may be superfluous)."

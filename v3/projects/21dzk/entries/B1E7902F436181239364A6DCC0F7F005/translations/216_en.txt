That character is permanent because the object of designation is fixed. All other teachings are impermanent. (This is clarified below the Four Veda treatises, and should also be seen in Separate Extract, First fascicle. Written below. This clarifies the causes and conditions of the Clarity Treatise. The *Pivotal Essentials*, upper fascicle, should especially be seen.)

**Sound-Manifestation theorists** hold that sound-substance originally exists and manifests through dependence on conditions. The essential nature is permanently abiding. This calculation has two types. First, following each individual thing, each has one permanently designating nature. Like non-analytical cessation, through sounds emitted by investigation and analysis, manifesting sound is impermanent. Now they use multiple sounds as the substance. Second, all dharmas together commonly have one permanently designating sound. Like suchness, manifested through sounds emitted by investigation and analysis. These sounds are impermanent. Now they take only one permanent sound as the substance. Those sound-echoes, etc., are merely manifesting conditions, not designating substance. Within these two types, each has two kinds. First, calculating the complete part - all sounds, internal and external, are permanently abiding. Second, calculating one part - internal sounds are permanent, external sounds impermanent, because they are not designating. Like sound-echoes. Therefore Sound-Manifestation theory is generally bundled into four calculations.

**Sound-Generation theorists** claim sounds originally do not exist but arise through waiting for conditions. Once arisen, they permanently abide. Because they are generated by sound-echoes, etc. This calculation has two types. First, calculating multiple substances, like non-analytical cessation. Second, calculating one substance, like suchness. Sound-echoes are generating conditions with impermanent substance. Now they take permanent sounds as substance because they are designating. Echoes are not designating. These each have two types. First, calculating the complete part; second, calculating one part. This should be understood according to the previous pattern. Bundled into four calculations. Therefore Sound-Manifestation and Sound-Generation each have four types.

**Conforming-to-World theorists** hold that everything is the four great elements, so they take the permanent four great elements as substance. Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya, and Clarity treatises each have one type; Sound-Manifestation and Sound-Generation each have four categories. Conforming-to-World non-Buddhists, when totaled together, have twelve types of non-Buddhists. (This should be seen in the *Private Records on Consciousness-Only Meanings*.)

**Lower Section**

The *Dharma Garden Sound Training* states: "Lokāyata (previously called 'evil respondents') - initially correctly in Sanskrit called 'lokāyatika.' Called 'Conforming-to-World non-Buddhists,' they are non-Buddhists who cling to calculating conformity with worldly teachings. Again, correctly in Sanskrit called 'vāma-lokāyatika,' called 'Left-Conforming-to-World non-Buddhists.' They cling to calculating non-conformity with worldly teachings, contradicting the previous explanation, hence called 'Left-Conforming-to-World non-Buddhists.'" Regarding Sound-Clarity treatises, see *Pivotal Essentials* upper fascicle and Separate Extract, first fascicle.

**Four Categories of Non-Buddhists** (cited in the *Consciousness-Only Treatise*)

1. **Sāṃkhya and other non-Buddhists** (The treatise states: "First, clinging that existent dharmas and existence-nature, etc., are definitely one in substance")
2. **Vaiśeṣika, etc.** (The treatise states: "Second, clinging that existent dharmas and existence-nature, etc., are definitely different in substance")  
3. **Shameless ones, etc.** (The treatise states: "Third, clinging that existent dharmas and existence-nature, etc., are both one and different")
4. **Wrong livelihood, etc.** (The treatise states: "Fourth, clinging that existent dharmas and existence-nature, etc., are neither one nor different")

*Treatise*, first fascicle, states: "Although the categories of various non-Buddhists are many, their clinging to existent dharmas does not exceed four types." The *Hetuvidyā Commentary*, middle fascicle, states: "At the beginning of formation kalpas, non-Buddhists appeared, named 'Kapila.' This means 'yellow-red colored sage.' ... Up to extensive explanation. He explained twenty-five principles. Briefly as three, moderately as four, extensively as twenty-five principles... Up to extensive explanation. 'Transformation' means the middle twenty-three principles. Not newly generated in substance, but transformations of fundamental essential nature. 'Self-knower' means the spiritual self. Capable of experiencing objects with marvelous function." The *Consciousness-Only Commentary* has the same textual meaning, so it is abbreviated. They do not establish the impermanence of arising and ceasing.

**Seventh: Clarifying Sāṃkhya's Etymological Origin and Established Doctrinal System** (See *Hetuvidyā Commentary* middle fascicle and *Consciousness-Only Treatise Commentary*, first final fascicle)

Sāṃkhya practitioners - in Sanskrit called "sāṃkhya." This translates as "number." That is, the number of wisdom. They establish the name based on numbering and measuring all dharmas as fundamental. From number arises theory, hence called "Sāṃkhya." Treatises capable of generating number are also called "Sāṃkhya."

Those who compose Sāṃkhya and study Sāṃkhya are called "Sāṃkhya practitioners." This master's composition, the *Golden Seventy Treatise*, tells of a non-Buddhist who entered the Golden-Ear Country, covered his belly with iron plates, wore a fire basin on his head, beat the royal debate drum, and sought debate with monks. Through disputing whether the world initially existed or later became non-existent, he slandered that monks were inferior to non-Buddhists. He then composed seventy verses propounding the Sāṃkhya school. The king's intention sided with him and bestowed gold. The non-Buddhist, wanting to manifest his reputation, named his composition the *Golden Seventy Treatise*. That treatise's prose commentary was composed by Bodhisattva Vasubandhu. The original circumstances of this *Golden Seventy Treatise* are as in Commentary fascicle four. Sāṃkhya and others calculate that thought is the self-mind with real substance, namely calculating the perceiving as self-dharma. Like Vaiśeṣika masters, etc., having separate self-substance that is not real existent thought-dharma, they calculate self-dharma regarding objects. (This should be seen in *述記*, first fascicle.)

**Clarifying the Original Master of Sāṃkhya Non-Buddhists**: There was a non-Buddhist named "Kapila." The ancient "Kapilas" is a corruption. This means "yellow-red." Because his beard, hair, and facial color were all yellow-red. Now noble Brahmins in the West are all yellow-red colored. The contemporary world called him "Yellow-Red Colored Sage." Among his later disciples, the foremost, like the masters of eighteen schools, was named "Varsā" (meaning "rain" because he was born in the rainy season, hence taking this as his name). His rain-faction disciples are called "Rain-Assembly Non-Buddhists."

*Hetuvidyā Commentary Questions and Answers*, first fascicle: Regarding "saying that at kalpa-beginning Akṣapāda first established authentic and似[apparent]," Question: "Why was that ancient sage named 'Akṣapāda' (Foot-Eye)?" Answer: "Yi states there are four explanations. First, having eyes under the feet, hence called 'Foot-Eye.' Second, parents arbitrarily established the name. Third, wisdom's ability to see, taking this as metaphorical name. Fourth, having eyes throughout the body is called 'Foot-Eye.'" Question: "Among these four explanations, which is correct?" Answer: "Taking metaphor as name is correct."

**Lower Section**

Question: "Why is this called correct?" Answer: "Moreover, Thousand-Eyed Indra does not actually have a thousand eyes, but is called 'Thousand-Eyed' because he can see a thousand kalpas. This is also similar. 'Foot-Eye' means wisdom-eyes pervade the body, can be present in both feet, hence named 'Foot.' This is the third type - taking metaphor as name. This accords with the *Supreme Commentary* text." (The fourth text should be cited and seen.) Question: "Why does Yi's commentary consider metaphor correct?" Answer: "This also does not contradict the intention. Having eyes under feet should be spoken of like Thousand-Eyed Indra."

**The Rain-Assembly's Established Twenty-Five Principles**

The verse states: "Essential nature, great, ego-pride, five subtle elements, five gross elements, five knowledge [organs], five action [organs], mind-evenness, self-knower." Generally abbreviated as three, next moderate as four, finally extensive as twenty-five principles. That treatise (*Golden Seventy*) states: "Abbreviated as three means: transformation, essential nature, self-knower. Transformation means the middle twenty-three principles. What is created by essential nature is called transformation. Essential nature is primordial nature. Now called 'essential nature,' anciently called 'primordial nature.' Now also called 'predominant nature.' Before generating the great, etc., abiding in self-portion is called 'essential nature.' If generating the great, etc., it is called 'predominant nature' because function becomes increasingly predominant. Self-knower is the spiritual self. Moderate as four means: First, fundamental but not transformational - namely essential nature itself. Because it can generate the great, etc., it is called fundamental. Because it does not arise from others, it is not transformational. Second, transformational but not fundamental. One explanation: sixteen principles - namely eleven [sense organs] and [five great elements], totally sixteen principles. Another explanation: only eleven [sense] organs. Only arising from others is called transformational; unable to generate others, therefore not fundamental. Third, both fundamental and transformational...

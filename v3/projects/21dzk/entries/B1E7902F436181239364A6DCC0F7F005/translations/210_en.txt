The Tathāgata is indeed a lion among humans. Therefore, the seat where he sits is also called a lion [seat]. There are no sufferings that cannot be eliminated, and virtues are necessarily complete therein.

**Section 24: Clarifying the Ten Characteristics of the Great Ocean**

The *Sixty-fascicle Avataṃsaka*, fascicle 28, states: "Sons of the Buddha, just as the great ocean is called 'great ocean' because of its ten characteristics and cannot be destroyed, what are these ten? 1) Gradually deepening; 2) Not accepting corpses; 3) Other waters losing their original names; 4) Having one taste; 5) Containing many treasures; 6) Being extremely deep and difficult to enter; 7) Being vast and immeasurable; 8) Containing many large-bodied beings; 9) Tides never losing their timing; 10) Being able to receive all great rains without overflowing. The bodhisattva stages are likewise indestructible due to ten causes."

8. Vast offerings (using material reverence and dedicating to bodhi for long periods, with the three karmas united in collecting wealth, seeking and obtaining from others, making vows to magically create hundreds of thousands of bodies, respectfully prostrating, each body producing hundreds of thousands of hands to hold and scatter incense and flowers, producing hundreds of thousands of voices to praise the Buddha in song, and producing hundreds of thousands of wonderful adornments as offerings, as well as universally rejoicing in all offerings throughout the ten directions—though the effort is small, boundless vast offerings are generated);

9. Unstained offerings (not making offerings with contemptuous, deceitful, negligent, or impure objects);

10. Right practice offerings (even momentarily cultivating the four immeasurables, or briefly having faith and patience in the inexpressible dharma-nature, dwelling in the signless mind, protecting the pure precepts of bodhisattvas, and cultivating the four means of attraction—one should remember this as supreme, surpassing previous offerings by hundreds of thousands of millions, beyond comparison).

The *Yogācārabhūmi*, fascicle 44, explains ten types of offerings to the Tathāgata, including relic offerings, stupa offerings, present offerings, non-present offerings, self-made offerings, teaching offerings, treasure offerings, vast offerings, unstained offerings, and right practice offerings.

[Ending] at Yuhua Temple. If there are doubts regarding sūtras and treatises, one should quickly ask questions. Do not have later regrets." None of the disciples who heard this could help but cry in alarm. They all said: "The Master's venerable body is healthy and well, and calculating his years, he has not yet reached old age and senility - why does he suddenly speak such words?" He replied: "I know this matter myself. It is not something the disciples can fully understand." At this time the Dharma Master had no illness, and all the disciples were suspicious and wondered.

*Yogācāra-bhūmi* fascicle 2 phonetic commentary (by Xuanying) states: Regarding "mao shu" (senility), ancient texts had two forms - "hao" and "mao," now written as "hao." The fanqie pronunciation is mo-bao. The *Record of Rites* states "eighty years is called mao." Zheng Xuan said: "Mao means confused. It also means disordered. When old and mature, one becomes confused, disordered, and suspicious."

Dharma Master Fajin's *Phonetic Commentary to the Suvarṇaprabhāsa-sūtra* (fascicle 10) states: Regarding "old and senile," the lower character has fanqie mao-bao. "Mao" comes from hair turning white. The *Record of Rites* also calls it "yi." Eighty or ninety is called "fa" (white hair), one hundred years is called "qi yi" (life expectancy). Zheng Xuan said regarding "mao": "It means confused and disordered."

It also says: When old, reaching seventy is called "mao," meaning the head hair becomes white. Eighty is called "die" (fanqie da-luo, meaning old) - like iron, because the skin changes to be like iron. Ninety is called "teaching and guiding." Like one hundred years, it is called "qi" - returning, based on nourishing. When the body is old, one no longer knows the good or bad taste of food. Filial children期 (expect to) fully practice the way of nourishment. It also says: The *Record of Rites* states "fifty years is called decline."

**Chapter 15: Clarifying the Eight Declensions**

There are two types: general and specific. Within the specific, there are three types of eight declensions: 1) masculine eight declensions, 2) feminine eight declensions, 3) neuter eight declensions. Seven declensions are also called "seven inverted sentences" and also called "discourse sentences."

*Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra* fascicle 500 explains this. The *Commentary* cites it. *Prajñā Phonetic Commentary*

**Chapter 16: Clarifying the Seven Past Buddhas** (Appended: matters of the seven Buddhas' bodhi trees)

Three Buddhas of the past Ornament Kalpa: Vipaśyin Buddha, Śikhin Buddha, Viśvabhū Buddha. Four Buddhas of the present Bhadra Kalpa: Krakucchanda Buddha, Kanakamuni Buddha, Kāśyapa Buddha, Śākyamuni Buddha.

*Sheśhaku* fascicle 4 states: Regarding "the seven Buddhas and others" - Question: Buddhas actually number like the Ganges' sands, so why speak of only seven? Answer: According to tradition, the Buddha's teaching and transformation originally benefits confused beings. Just as worldly people establish the seven ancestral temples, now following this, seven Buddhas are established, wanting to gradually transform them and return them to truth. The commentary's "the Bhadra Kalpa has four" - why is this so? Answer: The so-called seven includes counting both self and others. Therefore, later when reaching Maitreya, Vipaśyin is removed and the Compassionate One is added.

*Renwang-jing Commentary* middle fascicle (by Ximming, in the Two Truths chapter) says "seven past Buddhas" refers to: 1) One more Buddha before Vipasyin Buddha, 2) Vipasyin Buddha, 3) Shi Buddha, 4) Śikhin Buddha, 5) Viśva, 6) Krakucchanda, 7) Kāśyapa. Upon examination there is another explanation: Vipasyin is first, Śākyamuni is seventh. Following the majority in discussion, hence "seven past Buddhas" is said. According to reality, the one Buddha Śākyamuni is present.

**Matters of the Seven Buddhas' Bodhi Trees**

*Bhūmi-gatha-sūtra* fascicle 6, Chapter on Transcending the World, states: Vipasyin Buddha attained enlightenment under the nigrodha tree.

This was an araṇya place. Śikhin Tathāgata attained enlightenment under the śirīṣa tree - this was an araṇya place. Viśvabhū Tathāgata attained enlightenment under the aśvattha tree - this was an araṇya place. Krakucchanda Buddha achieved correct awakening under the aśoka tree - this was an araṇya place. Kanakamuni Tathāgata achieved complete perfect awakening under the udumbara tree - this was an araṇya place. Kāśyapa Tathāgata achieved complete perfect awakening under the banyan tree - this was an araṇya place. Śākyamuni Tathāgata [attained enlightenment] under the pipala tree - you should know this place. Araṇya places have such immeasurable and boundless meritorious benefits.

**Chapter 17: The Ten Great Masters** (*Huiri Treatise* states: "The ten great masters are all Tathāgatas who will become Buddha in the Bhadra Kalpa, not just Dharmapāla alone")

1. Dharmapāla (son of the emperor of Kāñci city in Draviḍa country. Died at age 32 at the Mahābodhi Temple. A voice from space announced: "This is one Buddha of the Bhadra Kalpa." In Sanskrit called "Dharmapāla" - dharma means law, pāla means protection. This great master was from South India)

2. Guṇamati (Sanskrit: Guṇamati. Teacher of Sthiramati. His sacred virtue was spiritually extraordinary, not easy to detail)

3. Sthiramati (Sanskrit: Sthiramati. He compiled the *Abhidharma-samuccaya*, rescued the *Abhidharmakośa*, refuted the Sautrāntika masters. Contemporary predecessor with Master Dharmapāla. Person from Rārā country in South India. His spiritual brilliance was supremely high, difficult to discuss)

4. Bandhushrī (Sanskrit: Bandhushrī. Contemporary with Bodhisattva Vasubandhu. First briefly explained the root verses, wonderfully grasping the author's intention. Later explained based on this)

5. Nanda (Sanskrit: Nanda. Founder-teacher of Śūramgama. Advocate of the doctrine of newly-perfumed seeds only. Also advocate of cause and effect at different times. Does not establish the five faculties like time, etc. The five uncertain seeds are the five faculties. Composed *Yogācāra Commentary*. *Commentary Record* fascicle 2 end states: "Below, the second newly-perfumed [doctrine] is the teaching of Venerable Nanda, founder-teacher of Śūramgama")

6. Śuddhacanara (Sanskrit: Śuddhacanara. Contemporary with Sthiramati. Composed *Commentary on the Seventy [Verses] on Ultimate Meaning* and *Abhidharma-samuccaya Commentary*)

**Lower Section**

7. Citrabhānu (Sanskrit: Citrabhānu. Also contemporary with Vasubandhu. Though hiding in worldly life, his Way was high in both conventional and ultimate truth)

8. Viśeṣamitra (Sanskrit: Viśeṣamitra)

9. Viśeṣaputra (Sanskrit: Viśeṣaputra) 

10. Jñānacandra (Sanskrit: Jñānacandra. These latter three masters were all disciples of Dharmapāla. Some explained *Yogācāra*, others wrote separate commentaries and annotations. Their way-names were far-reaching, their words and intent all profound. Their spiritual virtue was already high, difficult to exhaust in words)

Among those who composed *Vijñānavāda commentaries*, though there were ten great masters, among them Dharmapāla's reputation and virtue stood out uniquely. Therefore when titling the treatise, he was placed at the head. This master's teachings have the most to research. Among various doctrines, they mostly serve as guidance. The erroneous lose their direction, correct principles gain strength. Surpassing the masses of masters and standing out among the sages - perhaps this describes only one person.

Bodhisattva Vasubandhu appeared in the world 900 years after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa and composed the *Vijñānavāda Root Verses*. The two masters Bandhushrī and Citrabhānu appeared contemporary with Vasubandhu and composed explanatory treatises. 1,100 years later, the remaining eight great masters finally composed these commentaries. *Lamp* fascicle 4 states: Originally there were ten commentaries circulating separately in the West. Since Xuanzang was the translator, he was able to deeply penetrate them - others need not doubt.

Master Candrapāla is also called Candragarbha. The *Commentary Record* (fascicle 2 end) states: Now Master Dharmapāla recounts the recent doctrines of Candrapāla and others. This [Candrapāla] was a master of original existence only. Next was the newly-perfumed master Nanda. Later came the correct doctrine of both new and ancient types by Dharmapāla.

**Chapter 18: Clarifying the Five Types of Half-Men** (In old sūtras and treatises written as "paṇḍa" or "paṇḍaka," both indicating severity. This is called "eunuch" - there are five types)

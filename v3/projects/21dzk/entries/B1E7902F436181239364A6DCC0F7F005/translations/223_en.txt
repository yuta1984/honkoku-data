This indicates the ruler of the third dhyāna. The *Great Perfection of Wisdom* fascicle 570 mentions the patient-world ruler Brahmā King with topknot. Śikhin refers to the hair on top of the head. This is precisely the Brahmā King with topknot, which is an alternative name for the patient-world ruler Great Brahmā King. Light-brightness refers to the assembled dhyāna kings.

**Nineteenth: Clarifying the Eighty-Four Thousand Dharma Gates** (Appending the Hīnayāna establishment)

The *Commentary*, fascicle five final, says: "Discriminating the distinctions of sentient beings' mental activities. This is the mental transformation of the eighty-four thousand dharma gates... The *Buddha-Ground Sūtra* says there are three bodily transformations... and four mental transformations. First is discriminative mental transformation, second is creative mental transformation, third is initiative mental transformation, fourth is receptive mental transformation. Discriminating the distinctions of sentient beings' mental activities refers to the initial mental transformation. The *Bhadrakalpika Sūtra*, fascicle two, explains: From initially cultivating the dharma-pāramitā to finally distributing the Buddha-body pāramitā, there are 350. Each possesses the six perfections. Thus there are 2,100 in total. Corresponding to the mental activities of sentient beings with greed, hatred, delusion, and equalized [afflictions], there are 8,400. Removing the faults arising from the six meaningless [activities] of the four great elements, multiplied by ten results in 84,000." The same work's *演祕*, fascicle four, says: "The commentary's 'from initially cultivating to 350' means: From initially cultivating the perfection dharmas, within each perfection, all possess the six perfections. The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment, six pāramitās, four means of gathering, ten fearlessnesses, ten powers, eighteen distinctive qualities—all are dharmas within the 350." The commentary's "six meaningless" refers to these five sense objects, etc., which sentient beings indulge in but have no beneficial meaning. Alternatively called the six coverings, they cover all the wholesome dharmas possessed by sentient beings." Regarding the six meaningless and six coverings, see Master Gichū's *Commentary on the Hundred Dharmas Treatise*.

**Lower Section**

The *Benevolent King Sūtra Commentary*, volume one (by Ximingshi), says: "The sūtra's 'possessing 84,000 perfections of wisdom.' The explanation states: If according to the *Bhadrakalpika Sūtra*, from beginning with the radiance perfection to ending with distributing relics perfection, there are collectively 350 merit gates. Each cultivates the six perfections. This makes 2,100. Taking these 2,100 and applying them to ten dharmas, four elements, and six coverings—within the ten, each explains 2,100, making 21,000. Then taking these 21,000 and applying them to four [types of] sentient beings: first, those with much greed; second, those with much hatred; third, those with much delusion; fourth, those with equal [portions of] the three poisons. These four each have 21,000. Four groups of 21,000 makes 84,000." The *Repaying Kindness Sūtra*, fascicle six, says: "Regarding the 80,000 dharmas, it also says: Just as roots, stems, branches, and leaves are called one tree, the Buddha's teaching the dharma from beginning to end for sentient beings is called one collection. Thus eighty thousand. It also says: The Buddha's dharma teaching in one sitting is called one collection. Thus eighty thousand. It also says: Sixteen characters make half a verse, thirty-two characters make one verse. Thus eighty thousand. It also says: Long and short verses of forty-two characters make one verse. Thus eighty thousand. It also says: The fortnightly recitation of precepts is one collection. Thus eighty thousand. It also says: The Buddha's own teaching of 66,000 verses is one collection. Thus eighty thousand. It also says: The Buddha taught that there are eighty thousand afflictions. Dharma joy is also eighty thousand, called the 80,000 dharma collections."

**The Hīnayāna Eighty Thousand Dharma Collections**: The *Abhidharmakośa Verse Commentary*, fascicle one, says: "True practice as antidote—this is the third [method] of determining the quantity of dharma aggregates based on practice. This is the explanation of the orthodox school in the *Vibhāṣā*. Hence it says 'true.' Practice

refers to the 80,000 distinct practices of greed, hatred, delusion, etc. Antidotes are the impurity contemplations and other antidote gates. Because the objects of treatment—greed and so forth—number 80,000, the teachings that serve as antidotes also number 80,000. Speaking of 80,000 refers to the ten kinds of latent defilements: greed, hatred, etc. Each of these ten latent defilements uses nine latent defilements as expedients, totaling one hundred. This has a prior hundred and a posterior hundred, combining to make three hundred. Setting aside the original hundred and taking the prior hundred, each uses nine latent defilements as expedients, again making one thousand. Including the original hundred makes 2,100. The arisen have 2,100, the unarisen have 2,100, totaling 4,200. Regarding the thirty-five people of much greed, much hatred, much delusion, self-attachment, and conceptual thinking, each has 4,200, combining to make 21,000. Further applying this to the four people of three poisons and equalized [portions], each having 21,000, finally totaling 84,000. The 80,000 dharma aggregates as described are all encompassed within these two aggregates [of the five aggregates]. If taking sound as essence, it belongs to the form aggregate; if taking names as essence, it belongs to the formation aggregate." The ten latent defilements are: first greed, second hatred, third delusion, fourth pride, fifth doubt, sixth laxity, seventh laziness, eighth lack of faith, ninth dullness, tenth restlessness.

**Twentieth: Clarifying the Five Collections Established by Hīnayāna** (Established by the Vatsiputriya school)

The *Commentary*, fascicle one final, says: "They establish five dharma collections: the three times, the unconditioned, and the ineffable. According to their theory, this self is neither permanent nor impermanent, and cannot be described as either conditioned or unconditioned." The *Lamp*, fascicle two, says: "Question: The *Great Perfection of Wisdom* also explains five collections.

**Lower Section**

Namely, taking the three times as three, the conditioned as one called the conditioned collection, the unconditioned as one, also called the ineffable meaning. How does this differ? Answer: There are differences in meaning; they can be known by examining the texts." The *Great Perfection of Wisdom*, fascicle 54, says: "Moreover, abiding in these six pāramitās, buddhas and the two vehicles can cross the shores of five types of knowables. What are the five? First is the past, second is the future, third is the present, fourth is the unconditioned, fifth is the ineffable. This constitutes the bodhisattva-mahāsattva's perfection of the six pāramitās." This contradicts the *Lamp* and should be investigated. The five dharmas in collection thirty-two, fascicle six, are the same as this. Also, the meaning is entirely identical. The five dharmas explained in collection thirty-nine, fascicle ten, are all the same.

**Comprehensive Dharma Gate Section Twelve**

**Regarding the Five Divisions Explained in the Yogācāra** (For details, see the *Yogācāra Commentary*. Regarding the title of the *Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra*, see Jinchū's detailed explanation)

The first is the Stage of Foundations (*Mūlabhūmi*). The initial division broadly and briefly differentiates the meanings of the seventeen stages. Within this, the first half of fascicle one is the stage corresponding to the five consciousness bodies. The latter half plus fascicles two and three, totaling two and a half fascicles, constitute the mental stage. Fascicles four through ten, totaling seven fascicles, are the three stages beginning with conceptual thought (the first collection clarifies five stages). The second collection, fascicles eleven through the first half of thirteen, totaling two and a half fascicles, is the samāhita stage. One sheet in the middle of fascicle three is the non-samāhita stage. One sheet in the middle of the same fascicle covers both the conscious and unconscious stages. The latter part of the same fascicle, fascicles fourteen and fifteen, totaling two and a half fascicles, constitute the stage born from hearing. Fascicles sixteen through nineteen, totaling four fascicles, are the stage born from reflection. The

Section 1: Clarifying the Various Names of Tathatā (Suchness)

Dharmadhātu (realm of dharmas), dharmatā (dharma-nature), avitathatā (non-falsity), aviparināmatā (non-transformation), samatā (equality), anutpattikatā (non-arising nature), dharmaniṣṭhā (dharma-establishment), dharmasthititā (dharma-abiding), bhūtakoṭi (reality-limit), ākāśadhātu (space-element), acintyaḥ dhātuḥ (inconceivable realm).
　　　　The above eleven names are explained in the 296th fascicle of the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra.
　　　　Adding tathatā (suchness), there are twelve.

The interpretation: Dharmadhātu - the Madhyāntavibhāga states: "It is called dharmadhātu by the meaning of being the cause of noble dharmas, because all noble dharmas arise depending on this. Here 'dhātu' means cause." The Commentary, Volume 9, states: "It is called dharmadhātu because it is the supporting characteristic of the wonderful dharmas of the three vehicles. Dhātu means essence, that upon which wonderful dharmas depend."

Dharmatā - Commentary Volume 9 states: "Tā means essence. It is called dharmatā because it is the essence of all dharmas." The Commentary on the Adhyardhaśatikā, middle volume, states: "Dharmadhātu is the supporting characteristic of the wonderful dharmas of the three vehicles. Dharmatā is the true original essence of all dharmas."

Avitathatā (non-falsity) - Commentary Volume 9 states: "Being tranquil and free from error is called non-falsity." The Commentary on the Adhyardhaśatikā says the same.

Aviparināmatā (non-transformation) - Commentary on the Adhyardhaśatikā, middle volume, states: "Because it does not change at any time." The Abhidharma treatise states: "Because the true nature of selflessness does not change at any time, it is said to be without transformation."

Samatā (equality) - Commentary on the Adhyardhaśatikā states: "Because it pervades all dharmas, it is called equality."

Anutpattikatā (non-arising nature) - Commentary on the Adhyardhaśatikā states: "Because it is free from arising and cessation, it is called non-arising nature."

【Lower Section】
Dharmaniṣṭhā (dharma-establishment) - Zhu states: "Among all dharmas, because its nature definitely exists, it is called dharma-establishment."

Dharmasthititā (dharma-abiding) - Xuanzan Volume 4 states: "Because tathatā abides within all dharmas and its nature constantly exists, it is called dharma-abiding."

Bhūtakoṭi (reality-limit) - The Madhyāntavibhāga states: "By the meaning of non-error, it is called reality-limit, because it is not that upon which various errors depend." Commentary 9 states: "Without error and ultimate, the object without error is called reality-limit. It is also called 'true limit' because reality and truth have the same meaning."

Ākāśadhātu (space-element) - The Abhidharma treatise states: "Space means limitless nature, because it accommodates all activities."

Acintyaḥ dhātuḥ (inconceivable realm) - Zhu states: "Because verbal expressions cease and the path of investigation stops, it is called inconceivable."

Tathatā (suchness) - Having no alteration is called suchness. Treatise 9 states: "True means real, showing it is not false. Like means as-constant, indicating no change." Regarding suchness and the unconditioned, there are three names: dharma-position, selflessness, and ultimate meaning. These are not found in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra.

The Abhidharma treatise, second volume, explains seven names: tathatā, selflessness, emptiness, signlessness, reality-limit, ultimate meaning, and dharmadhātu. The Abhidharma explanation states: "The essence is constantly selfless, without alteration, called tathatā. The nature is free from the two selves, hence called selfless. By depending on this, defilements become empty and quiescent, so it is called emptiness. From form up to bodhi, the various characteristics are extinguished, called signlessness. Without error and ultimate, the object without error is called reality-limit. That which noble wisdom practices is called ultimate meaning. Because it is the object-characteristic of the wonderful dharmas of the three vehicles, it is called dharmadhātu. Dhātu means essence, that upon which wonderful dharmas depend." The above can also be seen in the original treatise on the eight unconditioned.

The Vijñaptimātra treatise has four names. The root verses have two names: "The ultimate meaning of these dharmas is also suchness."

These are the two names: ultimate meaning and suchness. The commentary treatise has two names: dharmadhātu and reality-limit. The treatise states: "Called dharmadhātu, reality-limit, etc." The word "etc." includes the three names from the seven names explained in the Abhidharma: selflessness, emptiness, and signlessness. Adding perfect accomplished nature makes five names. The Vijñaptimātra treatise is based on the Abhidharma. The Buddhabhūmi treatise, seventh volume, has six, calling it "real existence," which differs from the Abhidharma. The Yogācāra and Prakaraṇa treatises have names but are not like the Abhidharma.

The Lotus Sutra has two names: dharma-abiding and dharma-position. Dharma-abiding is as explained above. Dharma-position means that dharmas have purity and defilement, and leaving defilement to attain purity reveals this stage, hence called dharma-position. This can be seen in Xuanzan Volume 4.

Commentary Volume 2 states: "The Madhyāntavibhāga explains twelve names, like the Mahāprajñāpāramitā: from suchness to inconceivable realm." Abhidharma Volume 2 and Buddhabhūmi treatise Volume 7 are the same as the Mahāprajñāpāramitā and Madhyāntavibhāga. Though these names are explained, there are few.

The Vijñaptimātra chapter lists fourteen names. The eleven names here are those explained in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā and Madhyāntavibhāga. The above are fourteen names. However, the Vijñaptimātra Private Notes Volume 4 states that the Madhyāntavibhāga has these two names: selflessness and ultimate meaning.

The Madhyāntavibhāga, Characteristic-Discrimination chapter, asks: "What are the alternative designations for the emptiness of the knowable?" The verse states: "Briefly explaining alternative designations for emptiness: the alternatives are suchness, reality-limit, signlessness, ultimate nature, and dharmadhātu, it should be known." The treatise states: "Briefly, emptiness has these alternative designations. How should the meaning of these alternatives be known?" As follows, the treatise states: "The knowable emptiness explained here, by the meaning of non-change, is called suchness. True nature is constantly thus, without alteration or change. By the meaning of non-error, it is called reality-limit, because it is not that upon which various errors depend. By the meaning of characteristic-extinction, it is called signlessness, because all characteristics are permanently cut off here.

【Lower Section】
By the meaning of being the realm of noble wisdom, it is called ultimate nature, because it is the meaning practiced by supreme wisdom. By the meaning of being the cause of noble dharmas, it is called dharmadhātu, because all noble dharmas arise depending on this. Here 'dhātu' means cause. The meanings of selflessness, etc., should be known according to principle."

Question: Regarding explaining the various names of suchness, how many names does the Madhyāntavibhāga explain? The commentary states: "The Madhyāntavibhāga explains twelve names, like the Mahāprajñāpāramitā: from suchness to inconceivable realm." Regarding this, looking at the actual text of the original treatise, it only explains five names. Why does it say twelve? Also, it is questionable: if it says "dharmadhātu, etc." and the word "etc." does not include other names, it should not be limited to twelve types. Why does it say so?

The Commentary on the Adhyardhaśatikā, Volume 2, states: "These eight names here are one essence of suchness. True means real, showing it is not false. Like means as-constant, indicating no change. This is the meaning of being tranquil without falsity. Blocking falsity and revealing constancy is called suchness. Dharmadhātu is the supporting characteristic of the wonderful dharmas of the three vehicles. Dharmatā is the true original essence of all dharmas. Avitathatā is the non-false nature that is free from false perversions. Aviparināmatā means not changing at any time. Samatā means pervading all dharmas. Anutpattikatā: 'birth' means birth-convenience, like raw food, etc. These are false conditioned dharmas. It is free from this birth-convenience's firm nature. Also, 'birth' means arising-ceasing, the essence is called 'free from arising-ceasing essence,' called non-arising nature. Reality-limit is the object without error, meaning without perversion, this place being ultimate, hence called limit. Beyond selflessness, there is nothing more to seek. This text is abbreviated, only raising eight names. In the first assembly there are two names, in the Abhidharma, etc., there are six names. The essence is just one, like the distinctions among names."

The sixth [Nirvana Sutra] states: "The Śrāvaka vehicle is called provisional meaning, while the unsurpassed vehicle is called definitive meaning." The meaning of this sutra is: if a sutra explains that the Buddha is the dharmakāya, permanent and unchanging, this is called definitive meaning. What contradicts this is called provisional meaning. Here, provisionally depending on what Mahāyāna clarifies is called definitive meaning, but this does not mean there is no provisional meaning among the various Mahāyāna [teachings]. The Śrāvaka vehicle sutras have no definitive meaning whatsoever. Such証明 texts should be cited as follows. Simply according to the *Nirvana Sutra*, explaining the true permanent Buddha is called definitive meaning, while explaining the impermanent Buddha is called non-definitive meaning.

The explicit and implicit approach means: within Mahāyāna, explicit verbal teachings are called definitive meaning, while implicit verbal teachings are called provisional meaning sutras. In the past, during the second period, the World-Honored One, for those who aspire to cultivate Mahāyāna, based on all dharmas being without self-nature, unborn and unceasing, turned the wheel of true Dharma with implicit characteristics. Although even more extraordinary, there is still more above, and it is not yet definitive meaning. That is, explaining that all natures are empty - the teaching of three non-natures - because it is explained comprehensively through implicit intent, is called provisional meaning. Hence the *Consciousness-Only Treatise* Volume 9 states: "Therefore the Buddha explained with implicit intent that all dharmas are without self-nature, not that nature is completely non-existent. Speaking implicit intent words shows it is not definitive meaning." Therefore, when Mahāyāna sutras explain dharma characteristics that are not explicitly expressed in words and what is expressed is not ultimate, they are all called provisional meaning. When words are explicit and what is expressed is ultimate principle, this is called definitive meaning sutra.

The brief words and extensive language approach means: according to what *Yogācāra Decisive Analysis* 64 explains, provisional meaning sutras are sūtras, verses, prophecies and other teachings that the World-Honored One explained briefly, where the sutra is not yet complete and should be further explained. Definitive meaning teaching is the opposite of this. One should know these characteristics. This meaning is: even if it is a clear Mahāyāna teaching, if initially it only briefly explains without exhausting the principle, with what is clarified not being comprehensive, it is called provisional. When the expressed principle is not ulti-

mate, it is called provisional. Through this it is revealed that even Śrāvaka vehicle teachings have definitive meaning. Excluding sūtras, etc., other self-explanations, etc., because their language is specific and extensive, are called definitive meaning sutras. Among the clear Mahāyāna teachings' sūtras, etc., when the words explaining dharma are brief and the language is not yet extensive, there is also provisional meaning. This calls [teachings] definitive or provisional based on whether the words explaining meaning are extensive or brief, not based on whether the expressed principle is ultimate or not ultimate.

Among these, the first calls [teachings] definitive or provisional to make sentient beings abandon falsity and return to correctness. All Buddha sutras are called definitive meaning, while heretical explanations are called provisional. The second calls [teachings] definitive or provisional to make [beings] abandon the small and return to the great. All Mahāyāna are called definitive meaning, while various Hīnayāna teachings are called provisional. The third calls [teachings] definitive or provisional to make [beings] abandon the implicit and return to the explicit. All explicit verbal teachings of Mahāyāna are called definitive, but even though they are Mahāyāna teachings, implicit ones are called provisional. The fourth calls [teachings] definitive or provisional to make [beings] know the extensive and brief aspects of dharma. Various verse sutras where words are brief and incomplete are all called provisional, while non-verse words that are extensive and complete are called definitive.

These four approaches to definitive and provisional meaning explain the definitive and provisional language of all teachings. Therefore, although Mahāyāna sutras are all called definitive, within them one should still accept and reject [accordingly], and encouraging disciples to rely on definitive meaning should be extensively contemplated according to what is appropriate. For details, see the Brief Analysis Chapter. In Master Liuzhou's intention, one approach is added, namely establishing four levels based on dharma, as in the *Dharma Garden*. Also adding [the approach] based on person: for those who understand clearly without attachment, it is called definitive meaning; if for those who are attached, it is called provisional meaning. (See *Meaning Lamp* Volume 1.)

**Thirteenth Section: The Tathāgata's Teachings Are Free from Four Faults**

**Upper Section**
1. No improper place. 2. No improper time. 3. No improper vessel. 4. No improper dharma.

Explaining: All four types add the word "no" to show the meaning of separation. Because what the Buddha explained accords with principle, no objections can be raised, as it is free from the four faults. Up to: "place" means location, the place where benefit should be provided. When the teacher and student are here and can benefit, [the Buddha] necessarily provides benefit within this [context]. "Time" means time period, the time for benefit. In this life, this place, this time, when benefit should be provided at the appropriate time, it is never lost. "Vessel" means capacity level, the capacity to be guided. Speaking dharma according to capacity, there are no errors. "Dharma" means teaching dharma - doctrine, principle, practice, fruition, precepts, concentration, wisdom, etc. The dharma that should benefit, this dharma can benefit, necessarily according to capacity, without confusion.

Through this principle it can be inferred that Buddha's words are all for sentient beings, whether distant or near, generating uncontaminated wisdom. Therefore all three-basket dharma teachings, whether indirect or direct, are all called dharma wheels, all according to meaning, all for benefit, without empty words. Question: Heavenly rain, etc., as previously explained, all provide benefit. Coarse words and subtle language all return to ultimate meaning. (See *Consciousness-Only Commentary* Volume 4 and General Brief Analysis Chapter.)

*Sectarian Schools Commentary* states: Also, Buddha's words have no four types of faults. First, no improper place. Second, no improper time. Third, no improper vessel. Fourth, no improper dharma. Place means location, the place of benefit. Time means time period, the time of benefit. Vessel means appropriateness, the capacity to be guided. Dharma means teaching dharma - precepts, concentration, wisdom, etc., the dharma that should benefit. [The Buddha] never speaks incorrectly. Above it states: Also, all Buddha's words are without fault, according with principle, objections cannot be raised, called "according to meaning."

**Fourteenth Section: The Bodhisattvas' Four Reliances and Precepts** (*Yogācāra Treatise* explains this in fascicle 45. See that.)

**Lower Section**
1. Rely on meaning, not on words. (Only seeking meaning, not relying on incorrect words. Because this can generate respect and love.) 2. Rely on dharma, not on person. (If relying on the speaker is not according to principle, therefore only dwelling the mind on principle can lead to realization.) 3. Rely on definitive meaning sutras, not on provisional meaning sutras. (If one relies on provisional meaning sutras, harboring doubts and uncertainties, one cannot be clear. Therefore one should only respectfully accept definitive meaning sutras.) 4. Rely on wisdom, not on consciousness. (If one relies on consciousness, one cannot attain decisive realization. Only by relying on wisdom can one realize decisive superior understanding. See *Heart Sutra Profound Praise* Volume 1.)

*Gratitude Sutra* Volume 7 states: "Knowing gratitude and repaying kindness has four dharmas. First, following dharma and not following persons. Second, following meaning and not following letters. Third, following wisdom and not following consciousness. Fourth, following definitive meaning sutras and not following provisional meaning sutras. Practicing these eight dharmas is called repaying kindness." The previous four dharmas are: first, being close to good friends; second, listening to dharma wholeheartedly; third, contemplating its meaning; fourth, practicing according to the teaching. These combined are called the eight dharmas.

*Brahmajāla Sutra Commentary Phonetic Meanings* states: "Following text to grasp meaning generates five faults," etc. *Ten Stages Treatise* Volume 2 states: "You should not grasp meaning like sound. Following sound to grasp meaning has five types of faults: not having correct faith, retreating from vigor, deceiving others, slandering Buddha, and properly belittling dharma."

Question: If one relies on wisdom and not on consciousness, why is it called "consciousness-only" and taught that everything is consciousness-only? Answer: There are four meanings. First, cause-effect correlative explanation: To make [beings] abandon consciousness and rely on wisdom, the words "consciousness-only" are explained. Second, agent-object correlative explanation: If in contemplation, wisdom is strong and consciousness is weak, if what becomes object does not depart from mind, now because it becomes the contemplated object, it is called "consciousness-only." Third, primary agent correlative explanation: Also not departing from dependent-head construction, it is called "consciousness-only." Decision follows the agent, therefore one can rely on wisdom. Fourth, attraction-aversion correlative explanation: Also taking attraction as designation, sutras are only called prajñā. Taking aversion as appellation,

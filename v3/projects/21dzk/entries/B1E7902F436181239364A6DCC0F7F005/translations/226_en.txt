(The pronunciation guide is the same as in fascicle one.)

1. Frightening Māra (because when first leaving home, the demon palace trembles). 2. Mendicant (having already left home, begging for food to sustain oneself). 3. Pure keeper of precepts (gradually entering the saṅgha, one should uphold the precepts). 4. Pure livelihood (having already received the precepts, the three actions that arise are generated by non-greed, not depending on greed for wrong livelihood. Because one abandons the four types of wrong livelihood, it is called pure livelihood. The four types of wrong livelihood are as explained in the above pure dharma. The fifth is destroying evil.)

See *Lotus Sūtra Profound Praise*, fascicle 1, and *Vajracchedikā Praise Commentary*, upper fascicle. The above three commentaries are the same. *Benevolent Kings Sūtra Commentary*, upper fascicle (by Ximming), says: "Bhikṣu means 'mendicant.' Vajra Immortal says: Bhikṣu is a Sanskrit word. In interpretation here, it is sometimes called mendicant, sometimes destroyer of evil, sometimes frightener of Māra. Also, the original record says: In the causal stage it is called frightener of Māra, mendicant, destroyer of evil. Upon reaching the fruit, frightener of Māra is transformed into killer of thieves, mendicant is changed to worthy of offerings, destroyer of evil is explained as non-arising." Also, *Yogācāra*, fascicle 29, says there are five types of bhikṣus: 1. Begging bhikṣu (explanation: constantly practices begging for food). 2. Self-proclaiming bhikṣu (having committed grave offenses and lost the precepts, yet proclaims "I am a bhikṣu"). 3. Name-and-form bhikṣu (only having shaved head and dyed robes but not yet having precepts, only having name and form). 4. Affliction-destroying bhikṣu (a sage who has attained fruit). 5. White-four-karma bhikṣu (an ordinary person who has received precepts. Same as Gyōshin's assembly commentary). *Contemplation of Infinite Life Sūtra Commentary* says: "The bhikṣu assembly is Indian language. There is no fixed translation here. Sometimes called mendicant, frightener of Māra, etc. The original sound is called saṅgha, meaning harmonious assembly." *Yogācāra*, fascicle 29, says: "There are six types of pudgala. What are the six? 1. Śramaṇa. 2. Brāhmaṇa. 3. Pure conduct practitioner. 4. Bhikṣu. 5. Diligent one. 6. Renunciant. The fourth, bhikṣu, again has five types: 1. Food-begging bhikṣu. 2. Self-proclaiming bhikṣu. 3. Name-and-form

bhikṣu. 4. Affliction-destroying bhikṣu. 5. White-four-karma full-precept-receiving bhikṣu." Also, *Yogācāra*, fascicle 2, explains six types of livelihood: 1. Farming. 2. Trading. 3. Cattle herding. 4. Serving kings. 5. Learning writing, calculation, counting, and sealing. 6. Learning other craft occupations.

**The Five Types of Wrong Livelihood** (See *Mahāprajñāpāramitā*, fascicle 515.)

Bhikṣu has five meanings: 1. Frightening Māra—because of restraining the mind and leaving home. 2. Mendicant—because through begging one saves oneself and others. 3. Pure livelihood—because one abandons the five wrong livelihoods and rectifies the three actions. The five wrong livelihoods are: 1. Displaying unusual things for profit, like meditation practitioners counting prayer beads. 2. Praising one's own superiority for profit. 3. Reading fortunes with people for profit. 4. Speaking loudly to show威for profit. 5. To gain profit, speaking of previous gains to encourage people." This is from *Vajracchedikā Commentary*, upper fascicle. Right livelihood among the eight-fold noble path abandons these five wrong livelihoods.

Pure livelihood among the five meanings of bhikṣu abandons the four types of wrong livelihood explained above. However, the meaning of pure livelihood for bhikṣus in *Vajracchedikā Detailed Praise* abandons these five wrong livelihoods.

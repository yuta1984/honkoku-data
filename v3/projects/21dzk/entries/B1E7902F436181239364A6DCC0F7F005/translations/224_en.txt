The complete twenty fascicles constitute the Stage Born from Cultivation (the above second collection clarifies seven stages). From the first fascicle of the third collection to the first half of the fourth fascicle of the fourth collection, totaling thirteen and a half fascicles, constitutes the Śrāvaka Stage. This has four subsections: first, the Initial Yoga Practice Lineage Stage (first half of fascicle 21), the Initial Yoga Practice Entry Stage (through the end of fascicle 21), the Initial Yoga Practice Liberation Stage (fascicles 22-25, totaling four fascicles), the Second Yoga Practice (fascicles 26-29, totaling four fascicles), the Third Yoga Practice (fascicle 30 through fascicles 1-2 of the fourth collection, totaling three fascicles), the Fourth Yoga Practice (fascicles 33-34, totaling two fascicles). However, the final two sheets of fascicle 34 constitute the Pratyekabuddha Stage. From fascicle 35 of the fifth fascicle of the fourth collection through fascicle 10 of the fifth collection, totaling sixty, constitutes the Bodhisattva Stage (the above five collections explain the Stage of Foundations). The Bodhisattva Stage has many subsections. Each chapter is abbreviated to avoid prolixity. Fascicle 10 of the fifth collection and the final sheet-plus of fascicle 50 constitute the Stage with Remainder (this completes the Stage of Foundations). The final portion of the same fascicle is the Stage without Remainder (this completes the Stage of Foundations).

The second (Collections of Decisive Analysis, combining the sixth, seventh, and eighth into three collections. Within this, the initial fascicles 51-57, totaling seven fascicles, clarify the Five Consciousness Body Corresponding Stage and Mental Stage. Fascicles 58-61, totaling four fascicles, clarify the three stages beginning with conceptual thought. The next fascicles 62-63, totaling two fascicles, clarify the Samāhita Stage. The next fascicle 64 clarifies the Stage Born from Hearing. The next fascicles 65-66, totaling two fascicles, clarify the Stage Born from Reflection. The first half of fascicle 67 clarifies the Stage Born from Cultivation. From the latter half of the same fascicle through the first fascicle of the eighth collection (fascicle 71), totaling four and a half fascicles, clarifies the Śrāvaka Stage. From the second fascicle of the eighth collection through the tenth fascicle of the same collection (fascicle 80), totaling nine fascicles, clarifies the Bodhisattva Stage. The above second division briefly encompasses the decisive analysis of the profound essential meanings within the seventeen stages). The third is the Collection of Explanations (two fascicles of the ninth collection), which briefly encompasses explanations of the procedures of various sūtras. The fourth is the Collection of Different Approaches (fascicles 3-4), which briefly encompasses clarifications of the distinctions in names and procedures of various dharmas found in the sūtras. The fifth is the Collection of Matters (from fascicle 5 of the ninth collection through the tenth collection, totaling sixteen fascicles), which briefly encompasses clarifications of the most essential matters and meanings of the Three Piṭakas.

The verse says: "Five consciousness corresponding mind, three stages with conceptual thought and investigation, samādhi both with and without, conscious and unconscious stages, hearing-reflection-cultivation established, thus possessing the three vehicles, with remainder and without remainder—these are called the seventeen stages" (see the original treatise fascicle 1 and the Yogācāra Commentary).

**Both Bodhi and Nirvāṇa Transcend the Four Propositions and Eight Negations**

The four propositions are: neither existence nor non-existence, neither one nor different, neither numerical nor non-numerical, neither bright nor dark. Alternatively, the four propositions are: first existence, second non-existence, third both existence and non-existence, fourth neither existence nor non-existence. There are many such propositions. The eight negations are: first non-one, second non-different, third both one and different, fourth neither one nor different, fifth non-existence, sixth non-non-numerical, seventh non-bright (not defiled), eighth non-dark (not pure). Alternatively, it transcends the hundred negations. The *Supreme Victory Commentary*, fascicle 4 (based on the Chapter of Ākāśagarbha's Vow), says: "This bodhisattva practice transcends the four propositions and eliminates the eight negations." The same sūtra's Chapter Distinguishing the Three Bodies says: "Regarding this Dharma Body, characteristics and locations are non-existent—neither existent nor non-existent, neither one nor different, neither numerical nor non-numerical, neither bright nor dark, etc." The same commentary's fascicle 3 says:

"From the sūtra's 'neither existent nor non-existent' to 'neither bright nor dark.' In praise it says: This reveals non-existence. 'Neither existent nor non-existent' means transcending the four propositions of existence and non-existence: first existence, second non-existence, third both existence and non-existence, fourth neither existence nor non-existence. Only raising the fourth reveals transcending the first three. 'Neither one nor different' again transcends the four of oneness and difference: first one, second different, third both one and different, fourth neither one nor different. Again raising the fourth reveals transcending the first three. 'Neither numerical nor non-numerical' means transcending discriminative conceptual teachings is called non-numerical; being the realm of non-discrimination is called non-non-numerical. Also, because it transcends measurement it is non-numerical; because it belongs to dharmas it is non-non-numerical. Speaking of 'neither bright nor dark' refers to the 'neither defiled nor pure' of various sūtras. When initially transcending defilement, it is not now becoming pure, hence called non-bright; even when in defilement it is not defiled, hence called non-dark. Through this supreme excellence, the path of mind and speech is cut off." Also, the *Sutra of Innumerable Meanings* contains over forty types that do not praise the merits of the Dharma Body. The *Lotus Commentary*, fascicle 1, says: "Regarding 'thus,' the commentary on Innumerable Meanings states: When sages teach the dharma, it is solely to reveal thusness. Because it is thus, it says 'thus it is.' Master Bao says: By transcending the five slanders it is called 'thus it is.' The first phrase 'thus it is'—this sūtra transcends the slander of grasping existence as augmentation. The second phrase 'thus it is'—this transcends the slander of grasping non-existence as diminishment. The third phrase 'thus it is'—this sūtra transcends the slander of contradiction in grasping both existence and non-existence. The fourth phrase 'thus it is'—this sūtra transcends the slander of delusion in grasping neither existence nor non-existence. The fifth phrase 'thus it is'—this sūtra transcends the slander of conceptual elaboration in grasping neither non-existence nor non-non-existence." By this one can analogously understand. The Three Treatise school establishes the Eight Negations: neither arising nor ceasing, neither permanent nor impermanent, neither one nor different, neither coming nor going. Arising-ceasing, permanent-impermanent, one-different,

coming-going establish the Dharma Characteristics school. Also, the Dharma Characteristics school establishes the Ten Negations: neither existent nor non-existent, neither one nor different, neither arising nor ceasing, neither increasing nor decreasing, neither pure nor impure. Briefly stated: existence-non-existence, oneness-difference, arising-ceasing, increasing-decreasing, pure-impure (according to previous masters' understanding). See the Western Ming commentary on the *Benevolent King Sūtra*, volume 1, and Tiantai's *Textual Commentary*, fascicle 9.

"Not abiding in non-non-form through not abiding in non-non-abiding of feelings, perceptions, formations, and consciousness." In explanation: However, in interpreting this passage, various explanations differ. One explanation from the original record says: "'Not abiding in form' is the first phrase blocking form. Form is the form aggregate, namely the meaning of material obstruction. 'Non-form' is the second phrase blocking the four aggregates, namely the discriminating mind, etc. 'Non-non-form' is the third phrase repeatedly blocking form and mind. If stated completely, it should say 'not abiding in non-form and non-non-form,' but for brevity, both are called non-non-form. This meaning explains that the cognizing wisdom observing that true suchness transcends non-form and transcends both form and non-form." One explanation states: "'Not abiding' means the inner realization wisdom does not grasp or attach, hence called not abiding. As in the *Mahāyānasaṃgraha*, form has three types. First is discriminated form; namely, the three naturelessnesses eliminate the three natures, hence saying 'not abiding in form through not abiding in non-non-form.' Each dharma-nature true suchness transcends the four propositions and eliminates the hundred negations. Speaking of 'not abiding in form, etc.,' if stated completely should say 'not abiding in form, not abiding in non-form, not abiding in both form and non-form, not abiding in neither form nor non-form,' but for brevity, the third phrase and the non-form phrases within the phrase are removed, etc." (The commentary by Gyōshin has the same meaning). Question: What is the nature of the unforgetting dharma's constant abiding in equanimity? Answer: The *Commentary on the Chapter of Essential Meaning*, fascicle 2, says: "It refers to the constant abiding mindfulness of all Tathāgatas. If matters

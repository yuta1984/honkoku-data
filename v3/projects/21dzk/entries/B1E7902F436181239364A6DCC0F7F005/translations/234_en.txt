*Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra* fascicle 1 also explains two types of six kinds. The first six are somewhat different. Therefore that sūtra says: "Manifesting supernatural powers, causing this world to have six types of earthquakes - namely moving, extremely moving, equally extremely moving... (up to) erupting, extremely erupting, equally extremely erupting." These six types each have three aspects. This should be contemplated according to the above. If following *Daśabhūmi-śāstra* fascicle 12, moving, surging, awakening, arising, shaking, and roaring each have three aspects. That treatise's commentary says: "The six types of movement are: 1) moving, 2) surging, 3) ascending, 4) arising, 5) descending, 6) roaring." This is explained extensively there. Regarding the causes of movement, as explained in *Dīrghāgama*, movement has eight causes: 1) when great waters move, 2) when venerable spirits test their power, 3) when the Tathāgata enters the womb, 4) when emerging from the womb, 5) when attaining enlightenment, 6) when turning the Dharma wheel, 7) when ceasing teaching, 8) when entering nirvāṇa. *Ekottarāgama* explains eight causes... Regarding "movement realm," according to *Lotus Sūtra* this has two meanings: 1) called "small movement" - therefore that sūtra says "this world has six types of earthquakes," 2) great movement - Mañjuśrī's verse says "all Buddha lands immediately greatly shake." According to *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* fascicle 16, earth movement causes have small and great ones. Some move one Jambudvīpa, some move the four continents, some move minor chilicosms or major trichiliocosms. Small movements are due to minor causes - when virtuous people are born or die, one country's earth moves. This is small movement. Great movements are due to major causes - like when Buddha is first born, attains Buddhahood, or is about to pass into extinction, the three thousand great thousand worlds all shake. This time is great movement. The complete explanation is as given there. Regarding "movement intention," there are two explanations: 1) According to *Daśabhūmi-śāstra*, moving the earth treats four types of afflictions: beings who believe in heavenly birth believe in present heavenly rewards.

When celestial palaces shake, they immediately generate renunciation and give rise to Dharma-seeking minds. 2) Evil-doing beings don't recognize impermanence and let their minds run wild - now through earth movement they abandon evil and follow good. 3) Prideful beings, perhaps through spell power, can cause small movements and generate arrogant minds. 4) Through great movements they then know their inferiority. 2) According to *Śreṣṭhacintā Brahmā-sūtra Commentary*, there are seven. (Like the six types of transformational movement in *Xuanzan*, see *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Phonetic Commentary* fascicle 1 for details)

**Chapter 14: Clarifying that Ordinary Sentient Beings Have Eight Stages**

Combined in-womb and out-of-womb, there are eight stages - namely one initial stage in the womb and seven subsequent stages outside the womb.

1) Dwelling in womb stage, 2) Birth stage, 3) Infant stage, 4) Child stage, 5) Youth stage, 6) Middle age stage, 7) Old age stage, 8) Senility stage.

Explanation: The dwelling in womb stage refers to the eight positions in the womb. The birth stage refers to from approaching the birth canal and the time of actual birth until senility. The infant stage refers to from after birth until unable to walk and play. The child stage refers to being able to do various things. The youth stage refers to being able to enjoy sensual objects up to age thirty. The middle age stage is from after thirty until fifty. The old age stage is from after fifty until seventy. The senility stage refers to from after seventy until death. (The above is the meaning of *Yogācāra-bhūmi* fascicle 2) *Vijñānavāda* fascicle 8 says: "All stages of decline are collectively called old age." (Mahāyāna meaning doesn't specify age limits)

The eight in-womb stages: *Xuanzan* fascicle 4 quotes *Yogācāra-bhūmi* fascicle 2 saying there are eight positions in the womb treasury, namely:

Grasping the parents' genetic material, during the time of intoxicated confusion, one becomes constrained. Within the first seven days it's called kalala (mixed filth) - the father's and mother's impurities mixing together is called "mixed," being deeply detestable is called "filth." If already formed, due to the fetal arrow being thin inside. Within the second seven days it's called arbuda (bubble) - like a green bean, having the form of a pustule, inside and outside like curds, not yet reaching flesh. Within the third seven days it's called peśī (coagulated mass) - like heated blood gradually congealing. Therefore the Western regions call heated blood "peśī." If already becoming flesh but still extremely soft. Within the fourth seven days it's called ghana (thick mass) - gradually becoming thick. If already firm and thick, somewhat able to withstand touching. The fifth seven days is called praśākhā (limb position) - like a firm mass with five protrusions connected, one body and four limbs, with internal wind moving outward, generating the distinctive characteristics of root forms. The previous flesh mass grows and limb characteristics appear. Within the sixth seven days it's called the hair, body hair, and nail position - because hair and body hair emerge. Within the seventh seven days it's called the complete faculties position - because the five sense organs appear completely, clearly, and prominently. The *Great Treatise* says: "From this point onward, that supporting place appears clearly and distinctly, called the form position." Reaching this point, from beginning to end takes about three months with various developments. If there's no increase or decrease, it takes a total of 38×7 days to be complete in the womb. After another four days, the head turns downward and both feet turn upward. The fetal membrane then tears and presses toward the birth canal. Various sufferings press urgently at this time. This is called the time of the correct birth position, causing the mother immeasurable pain and suffering, and the fetal body likewise.

*Sheshaku* fascicle 3 says: The commentary's "due to the arrow being thin inside" - *Abhidharmakośa* says "this fetal arrow gradually increases." Commentary: If the child dwells in the womb, it harms the mother, like being struck by an arrow. An arrow can damage the body. Taking the name from the metaphor, it's called "fetal arrow." Due to the above initial doubt, it's called "thin inside." This discusses physical characteristics.

In Hīnayāna understanding, the five in-womb positions (like the usual first five positions among Mahāyāna's eight positions are the same). The five out-of-womb positions (see *Abhidharmakośa Commentary* fascicle 9): 1) infancy, 2) childhood, 3) youth, 4) prime years, 5) old age. (Mahāyāna also uses these)

*Yiyun* fascicle 2 says: The commentary's "ten time divisions of one lifetime" refers to: 1) kalala, 2) arbuda, 3) peśī, 4) ghana, 5) praśākhā - these are the five times in the womb; 6) infant, 7) child, 8) youth, 9) prime condition, 10) decline and old age - these are the five times out of the womb.

*Yanmi* fascicle 2 says: The commentary's "ten time period positions" - in-womb and out-of-womb each have five times, all as in the *Dharma Numbers*. *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Phonetic Commentary* says: "Fifty is called 'ai', sixty is called 'qi', eighty is called 'mao'."

*Yogācāra-bhūmi* fascicle 2 says: "Furthermore, what are the eight different positions of the womb treasury? Namely the kalala position, arbuda position, peśī position, ghana position, praśākhā position, hair-body hair-nail position, faculty position, form position, etc." (The complete text can be consulted)

*Lotus Xuanzan* fascicle 5 "qi jing" etc. The sūtra says "sixty is called qi."

*Xuanzang's Biography* says: When the first day of the first month of Linde first year arrived, the assembly and monks of Yuhua Temple requested translation of the *Mahāratnakūṭa-sūtra*. The Dharma Master declined saying: "I know this sūtra has no conditions in Chinese lands. Even if translated, it won't be completed." They continued to request and he couldn't refuse. The Dharma Master said: "If translated, it certainly won't reach five lines." He then translated four lines and stopped. He told his disciples and translation monks: "Conditioned phenomena necessarily return to cessation. With the nature of bubbles and illusions, how can there be long duration? Now in Linde first year, my age is sixty-three. I will certainly

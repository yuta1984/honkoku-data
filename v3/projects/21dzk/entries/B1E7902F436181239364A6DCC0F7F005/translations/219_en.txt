[They do not escape evil] destinies. Making offerings to pagodas and shrines does not yield great results. Other doctrines are largely the same as those of the Mahāsāṃghika school.

Fifth: The Sarvāstivāda (All-Exists) school teaches: "All-existence" has two aspects: first, dharma-existence; second, temporal existence. Mind, mental factors, matter, non-associated [formations], and the three unconditioned [dharmas] constitute all dharma-existence. Past, present, and future constitute all temporal existence. Thus all existent dharmas as taught are encompassed by two categories: first, name; second, form.

Sixth: The Haimavata (Snow Mountain) school teaches: All bodhisattvas are still of different nature. Bodhisattvas do not give rise to craving and attachment when entering the womb. Non-Buddhists cannot attain the five supernatural powers. There is no dwelling in heaven practicing pure conduct.

Seventh: The combined five schools of Vātsīputrīya, Dharmottarīya, Bhadrayānīya, Saṃmatīya, and Ṣaṇṇagarika teach: The self is neither identical with nor separate from the aggregates. The five consciousnesses have no defilement, nor are they separate from defilement. The twelve moments of entering the path of seeing are called "proceeding toward"; the thirteenth moment is called "abiding in the fruit."

Eighth: The Mahīśāsaka (Earth-Transformation) school teaches: Past and future do not exist; present and unconditioned exist. The Four Noble Truths are observed simultaneously. There is definitely no intermediate existence. There are also齊首補特伽羅 (individuals with equal heads). There is mundane right view but no mundane faculty of faith. There is no supramundane consideration and no uncontaminated investigation. Good is not causally conditioned. Stream-enterers can regress. There are nine unconditioned [dharmas].

Ninth: The Dharmaguptaka (Dharma-Protector) school teaches: The Buddha is included in the Sangha. Although the liberation of the Buddha and the two vehicles is one, their noble paths differ. Non-Buddhists cannot attain the five supernatural powers. [This is] the same as the Haimavata school. All arhat bodies are uncontaminated. Other doctrines are the same as Mahāsāṃghika calculations.

Tenth: The Kāśyapīya (Light-Drinker) school teaches: If suffering-dharmas have already been cut off and fully understood, then there is no karmic result. If not yet cut off and not fully understood, then there is karmic result. What has already matured has none; what is unmatured has [karmic result]. They teach that learner dharmas have maturation results. Other doctrines are largely the same as the Dharmaguptaka school.

Eleventh: The Sautrāntika (Sūtra-ist) school teaches: There is a pudgala in the ultimate sense. Even in the stage of ordinary beings there are noble dharmas. There are "root-edge aggregates." Edge aggregates are subtle consciousness, etc. Their positions are largely the same as the Sarvāstivāda school.

Within our own Mahāyāna there are two masters: First is the "edge master" - Bhāviveka and others who assist and support Nāgārjuna. The meaning of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras teaches that all dharmas are empty. Second is the "middle master" - namely Vasubandhu and others who assist and follow Maitreya. The Saṃdhinirmocana and other sūtras, based on the three natures, teach that all dharmas have both empty and non-empty [aspects]. The imagined is empty; the dependent and perfected are non-empty. The first nature exists conceptually but not in reality; the latter two natures exist in reality but not conceptually.

**Eleventh: The Discriminationists**

Question: "What school among the twenty schools are the Discriminationists?" Answer: "The end of the *Commentary* states that it refutes the Discriminationists. All wrong discriminations are called Vibhajyavādins. These are the four schools: Mahāsāṃghika, Ekavyavahārika, Lokottaravāda, and Kaukkuṭika. Because they dispute that the uncontaminated has no causes and conditions, [the text] also narrates their refutation together. Originally, within the Mahāyāna, those who [advocate] only new perfuming, the mind-mixture masters, etc., are called Discriminationists and also make this teaching."

The *Lamp* fascicle three states: "The 'Discriminationists' are either Mahāyāna variant masters who have seeds, or various Hīnayāna schools all called 'discriminationists' - not a fixed single school. Therefore in the *Compendium Treatise*, the Discriminationist tradition commentary refers to the Mahīśāsaka school. In the *Vibhāṣā*, the Discriminationist tradition refers to the Saṃmatīya school. In the text below of this treatise, the Discriminationists are said to be the Prajñaptivāda school. Therefore this text briefly has three interpretations: first, the four schools of Mahāsāṃghika, etc.; second, from beginning to end it refutes Mahāyāna masters; third, from beginning to end it refutes Hīnayāna masters. The Mahāsāṃghika school, etc., take the originally pure mind as capable of being a cause and

generating seeds. They do not permit the existence of seeds. Or again, those masters permit the existence of seeds. In refuting non-associated [formations], they speak of 'grasping latent defilements' - these are the Mahāsāṃghika, etc." The *Pivot Essentials* has three explanations.

The *Same-Different Extract* states: "'Discriminationists' - in the West called Vibhajyavādins. Translating this as 'Discriminationists' means naming them 'Accommodating Theorists.' Saṃmatavādins translates as 'School Masters.' Theorists are people who establish doctrines. However, when the Tripiṭaka Master calls them 'Discriminationists,' in the West there is no separate school affiliation. Simply within the sacred teachings, they separately generate principles, either assisting and rescuing other schools, or establishing principles to refute calculations. They are called 'Accommodating Theorists.' All such types are called 'Discriminationists.' This is not the name of a separate school."

Question: "Do the Discriminationists establish the existence of seeds or not?" Explanation: "Since 'discrimination' is not the name of a single school, in principle they also establish seeds without fault. Like the Mahāsāṃghika school, etc., they establish the existence of seeds. Or possibly, Mahāyāna variant masters hypothetically make this calculation, therefore there are seeds."

The *Pivot Essentials* (Treatise, second location) upper fascicle states: "In refuting the Discriminationists there are three parts: first narrating the position, next separate refutation, finally self-explanation. In the separate refutation there are two parts: first, the difficulty that emptiness-principle is not a cause; second, the difficulty that arising mind is not disputation. In the difficulty that arising mind is not disputation there are eight parts. The Mahāsāṃghika, etc., having no seeds, yet when refuting Discriminationists they speak of accomplishing seeds - this separately refutes Mahāyāna variant masters. Also, the Sautrāntika separately has seeds. The Sarvāstivāda's cause-meaning and seed-meaning - because the future has uncontaminated causes. The Mahāsāṃghika are similar to this also. The meaning that in ordinary person bodies there are causes of uncontaminated [dharmas] that can be born in the future is called 'seeds.' This is not the same as the Sautrāntika, etc."

**Twelfth: The Six Treatise Scholars**

First: *Saṃgītiparyāya-pāda-śāstra* (translated by Xuanzang, composed by Śāriputra)
Second: *Dharmaskandha-pāda-śāstra* (translated by Xuanzang, composed by Mahāmaudgalyāyana)  
Third: *Prajñapti-pāda-śāstra* (composed by Mahākātyāyana; the above three treatises were composed during the Buddha's lifetime)
Fourth: *Vijñānakāya-pāda-śāstra* (translated by Xuanzang, composed by Devaśarman)
Fifth: *Prakaraṇa-pāda-śāstra* (translated by Xuanzang, composed by Vasumitra)
Sixth: *Dhātukāya-pāda-śāstra* (same translator and composer)

The *Abhidharmakośa Verse Commentary* fascicle one states: "The 'various treatises' refers to the Six Treatises, etc. First, Śāriputra composed the *Saṃgītiparyāya-pāda-śāstra*; second, Mahāmaudgalyāyana composed the *Dharmaskandha-pāda-śāstra*; third, Kātyāyana composed the *Prajñapti-pāda-śāstra* (the above three treatises were [composed] during the Buddha's lifetime). One hundred years after the Buddha's nirvana, Devaśarman composed the *Vijñānakāya-pāda-śāstra*. By the beginning of the third century, Venerable Vasumitra composed the *Prakaraṇa-pāda-śāstra*. The earlier Six Treatises had somewhat fewer doctrinal categories. The *Jñānaprasthāna* treatise has the most extensive dharma-gates. Later masters called the six 'feet' and the *Jñānaprasthāna* the 'body.' Later masters mostly followed the *Jñānaprasthāna*. The *Mahāvibhāṣā* was composed based on it."

*Abhidhamma Treatise in Eight Chapters* (30 fascicles, translated by Zhu Fonian)
*Jñānaprasthāna Treatise* (20 fascicles, translated by Xuanzang; the above two treatises are the same original in different translations)

bedding, etc. If already carded and processed, it becomes soft, light, and suitable for use. Such practitioners, whose minds are attached to food, clothing, and bedding, through dhūta merits can purify and cultivate [themselves], making them pure and upright, gentle and wonderful, patient and compliant, following and depending [on the Dharma], able to cultivate the holy life.

As for specific antidotes: In food there are two types of food-craving that obstruct cultivation of goodness. To cut off fine food craving: regular begging for food and sequential begging for food. To cut off excessive food craving: only one-seat eating and stopping first, eating later. In clothing there are three types of craving that obstruct cultivation of goodness. To cut off excessive clothing craving: holding only three robes. To cut off soft-touch craving: holding only woolen robes. To cut off superior and wonderful craving: holding rag robes. In bedding there are four types of craving that obstruct cultivation of goodness. To cut off noisy and miscellaneous craving: dwelling in araṇya. To cut off craving for dwellings and sensual indulgence: constantly residing under trees, in remote places, and in charnel grounds. To cut off craving for comfortable lying and sleeping: constantly sitting upright with determination. To cut off bedding craving: places like constant sitting. Or opening up dwelling and sensual indulgence as two cravings making five is also acceptable.

*Lotus Sound Commentary* says: "Dhūta means washing and sifting, called 'great cleansing.' Or called 'abandoning the extraordinary.' Or called 'carding and beating,' removing dust and filth. The meaning of 'sifting and measuring' is not the original principle."

*Prajñāpāramitā Sound Commentary* on araṇya: Cien says, "In Tang it's called 'quiet place,' meaning 'place without impurity.'" Regarding dhūta, Cien says: "Anciently called toutuo, in Tang called 'washing and sifting.' Also called 'removing the extraordinary.' Or called 'carding and beating.'" *Essentials of Vinaya Conduct* translates the foreign sound as "sifting and measuring." *Sound Treatise* says: "Tuta is translated as 'removing dust.' Saying 'sifting and measuring' is metaphorical translation." *Xingting* says: "This is precisely the meaning of shaking out and removing afflictions."

**Chapter 2: Clarifying the Eighteen Items Held by Monks**

1. Tooth stick. 2. Cleansing beans. 3. Three robes. 4. Water bottle. 5. Bowl. 6. Sitting mat. 7. Staff with rings. 8. Incense burner. 9. Water strainer. 10. Hand towel. 11. Knife. 12. Fire starter. 13. Tweezers. 14. Rope bed. 15. Sūtras. 16. Vinaya. 17. Buddha image. 18. Bodhisattva image.

*Brahmajāla Sūtra*, lower fascicle, says: "When bodhisattvas practice asceticism and when traveling, going back and forth hundreds or thousands of li, these eighteen items constantly accompany their bodies. As for ascetics: from the 15th day of the first month to the 15th day of the third month, from the 15th day of the eighth month to the 15th day of the tenth month—during these two periods, these eighteen items constantly accompany their bodies like a bird's two wings."

According to Master Yiji's interpretation, excluding the two items of tooth stick and cleansing beans, the three robes are expanded into three types. During summer retreat, these should especially be used. This can be seen in *Renwang Jing Ximing Commentary* where it explains the three robes and accessories. They are included in that commentary's section on accessories. In Monk Superintendent Xinxin's commentary as well. All are as extracted from those texts.

**Chapter 3: Clarifying the Five Pungent Plants**

1. Garlic. 2. Grass onions. 3. Scallions. 4. Shallots. 5. Asafoetida.

Master Daxian's *Brahmajāla Sūtra Commentary* says: "The sūtra states 'If disciples of Buddha must not eat the five pungent plants,' etc. Commentary says: Although the five pungent plants are grasses, they are foul-smelling and difficult to approach. What worthy and good people avoid, hence the prohibition."

Master Fazang says: "Among these five, garlic is domestic garlic. Some say grass onions are foreign onions, and shallots are domestic onions."

The above three are commonly eaten by people. Regarding grass onions, *Erya* says: "Mountain onions with thin stems and large leaves. Should be written with the character ge. 'Grass' is incorrect. They exist in northern regions but not in Jiangnan." Regarding asafoetida, some say "onion shoots," but I haven't seen documentation. Some say in Jiangnan the leaves resemble wild garlic and the roots and stems resemble scallions, not found in northern regions. Another explanation: the medicine asafoetida, in Sanskrit called "xiqu." According to tradition, such five pungent plants, except for serious illness and beneficial purposes, should not be eaten otherwise. As the *Mañjuśrī-paripṛcchā Sūtra* says: "One must not eat garlic. If there are circumstances, one may eat it. If combined with medicine to treat illness, one may use it."

A certain vinaya text says: "Eating garlic [requires] perhaps seven days of monastic [restriction]." It says the local custom is to abstain from the five pungent plants, maintaining fragrant purity to cultivate the Way. Now greedily eating garlic for taste causes foul odors to spread outward, inviting criticism and damaging the Way. The transgression is not light. Therefore, the sage established three conditions constituting violation: 1. It is garlic, removing the pungent quality. The reason eating garlic is serious: first, it has fine taste that nuns happily consume greedily; second, it's the extreme among pungent things, hence serious. 2. No serious illness circumstances. 3. Swallowing constitutes pācittiya offense. In *Pañcavarga*, only raw garlic [constitutes] pācittiya.

The textual research by Ācārya Myōken of each school at Tendai Ryōgon-in should be consulted. Written on separate paper.

**Chapter 4: Clarifying One Announcement and Three Proclamations Formal Act (附: Differences in receiving ordination according to four vinayas and five treatises)**

One announcement means first making a single announcement. Three proclamations means afterward having three proclamations for the three grades of spiritual capacity: lower, middle, and upper. Lower grade practitioners very easily accomplish precept conduct, hence accomplished through single announcement. Middle grade practitioners accomplish precept matters through single announcement plus the first of the three proclamations. Upper grade practitioners find it extremely difficult to accomplish, hence requiring three-proclamation formal acts. Using one announcement and three proclamations, it's called "white-four formal act."

*Six-Fascicle Commentary*, fascicle 1, "General Discussion of Formal Acts," chapter 5 says: "Next, clarifying assembly procedures has three types. Single announcement matters are either minor, routine practices, or strict regulations. One statement informing the assembly accomplishes the formal matter. Second is announcement-two. Due to matters being involved, Buddha requires general knowledge. One announcement states the matter for notification, one formal act weighs whether the place is suitable, then accomplishes the previous task. Encompassing both announcement and formal act, hence called 'announcement-two.' Third is announcement-four. Receiving ordination, repenting serious [offenses], disciplinary sanctions, admonishments—matters encompass major and minor, emotions may contain discord. An announcement is not [just] one announcement for notification; measuring whether three procedures are suitable—how can this accomplish [the goal]? Using three formal acts encompassing the previous single announcement, hence called 'announcement-four.'

If examining conditions and characteristics, altogether there are 134 formal acts. Briefly speaking thus. Further expanding, there are still 39 single announcements, 57 announcement-twos, 38 announcement-fours. If including the previous two, then 184 procedures. I've heard of 101 formal acts. Why doesn't today's list match? Answer: This is general categorization, not definite numbers. One might also reference *Sarvāstivāda-vinaya*. That definitely has 101."

The single announcement formal act words say: "Assembly of monks, listen to the formal act being performed. Venerable assembly, listen. This person so-and-so seeks to receive full ordination from so-and-so. This person so-and-so now requests from the monk assembly to receive full ordination with so-and-so as preceptor. So-and-so declares himself pure, without various impediments, age twenty fulfilled, with three robes and bowl complete. If the time is appropriate for the assembly, may the assembly consent to receiving so-and-so's full ordination with so-and-so as preceptor. The announcement is thus." Having made the announcement, ask "Is the assembly accomplished or not?" Thus asking "accomplished or not?" The following three proclamations all ask the same regarding so-and-so.

The commentary also says: "One should also speak to the ordinand: 'Having made the announcement, the assembly all rejoices. Now performing the formal act, activating that precept-dharma. Don't let the mind become disciplinary or critical. Use the mind to respectfully receive.'"

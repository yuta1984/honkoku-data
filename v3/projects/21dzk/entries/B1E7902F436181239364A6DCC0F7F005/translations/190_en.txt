The meaning of this fifth level has two aspects. First, proceeding from coarse to subtle: In the sequence of the five levels, this level concerns the superior mind-kings, contrasting principle and phenomena, eliminating phenomena and realizing principle, which is called "consciousness-only." This is the meaning of this level. Second, regarding the principle and phenomena of the five dharmas: eliminating the first four phenomena and realizing the fifth principle. That realized principle is called "consciousness-only." This relies on and is established based on the meaning of other character-nature correlations. Both are without error. Private notes state: Question: Are the five levels of consciousness-only doctrinal consciousness-only or theoretical consciousness-only? Answer: Both doctrine and theory have five levels. However, what is clarified here is theoretical consciousness-only. Hence Huizhao states: "Since what is expressed already has five levels, the doctrine that expresses also has five levels." Are these five levels established by the chapter master? Answer: The *Lamp* states: "Sometimes using Vasubandhu's five principles to establish the Buddha's five teachings, sometimes using the five teachings to establish those five principles, sometimes using the five teachings to establish the five teachings, sometimes using the five principles to establish the five principles, etc." Thus, comparing Śīlabhadra with Dharmapāla, Sarvabuddhavišaya with Śīlabhadra, Hongdao with Sarvabuddhavišaya, there could be a total of 424 interpretations. This can be known through calculation. The five levels of consciousness-only are the consciousness-only that is contemplated. The chapter states: "The contemplated consciousness-only takes everything as its essence, and because it comprehensively contemplates existence and non-existence as consciousness-only, it briefly has five levels." (See *Heart Sutra Profound Praise* Volume 1.) *Profound Praise* Volume 1 states: "Now examining in detail, although the consciousness-only explained in the sacred teachings has countless varieties, it does not exceed five levels. First is eliminating the false and preserving the real consciousness," etc.

**Ninth Section: Five Types of Consciousness-Only** (These are the consciousness-only of five types and six approaches. The six approaches are explained below.)
1. Object consciousness-only. The *Abhidharma Sutra* states: "Hungry ghosts, animals, humans, gods, etc." Such texts that only explain the contemplated objects of consciousness-only are all object consciousness-only.

**Lower Section**
2. Doctrinal consciousness-only. The *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* states: "Due to attachment by one's own mind," etc. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* explains: "The three realms are mind-only." The *Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra* explains: "What all consciousnesses apprehend are only manifestations of consciousness," etc.

3. Theoretical consciousness-only. The *Thirty Verses*: "These consciousness transformations are the discriminated and discrimination. Through this, both are non-existent. Therefore everything is consciousness-only." Establishing the principle of consciousness-only in this way are all theoretical consciousness-only.

4. Practice consciousness-only. The verse "When bodhisattvas are in meditative absorption," etc. The four investigations, four true realities, etc., are all practice consciousness-only. That verse is from the *Yogavibhāga* composed by Maitreya Bodhisattva. The *Abhidharmasaṃuccaya* quotes it. That is, the root verses of the *Abhidharmasaṃuccaya* composed by Asaṅga Bodhisattva quote it. This is called "instructing bodhisattvas." (The *Yogavibhāga* has not yet been translated. See *Private Notes on Consciousness-Only* Volume 3, and also see *Consciousness-Only Treatise Commentary* Volume 9.)

5. Fruition consciousness-only. The *Buddha Stage Sutra* states: "In the great perfect mirror wisdom, all phenomenal object-consciousnesses appear within it," etc. Also the *Sutra on the Adornment of Tathāgata Merit* states: The attainment of fruition in the *Consciousness-Only Treatise* are all fruition consciousness-only.

The chapter states: "The five types of consciousness-only explained here comprehensively encompass all consciousness-only without exception."

Private notes state: Comprehensively gathering the scattered explanations of consciousness-only in sutras and treatises, bundling them into seven categories. Sentient beings, not knowing the realms of true and false, generate the causes of afflictions and karma and experience various sufferings. Now properly reversing this, these five types are established. To make beings know objects, object consciousness-only is explained; to make them abandon delusions, doctrine and theory are established. Heretics and Hinayana, not understanding Mahayana doctrine and theory, establish false doctrines and theories, generating various afflictions. Through this Mahayana consciousness-only doctrine and theory, they return to correctness, abandon falsity, and do not generate various delusions. To counter karmic actions, practice consciousness-only is established; to reach the fruition of suffering, fruition consciousness-only is established. Hence the chapter states: "However, comprehensively and thoroughly examining all consciousness-only explained in various teachings

does not exceed five types."

**Tenth Section: Six Approaches to Object Consciousness-Only**
1. Explaining consciousness-only based on what is grasped. The *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* text "due to one's own mind's attachment." This is because it depends only on the false manifestation of the grasping mind.

2. Clarifying consciousness-only based on the contaminated. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* text "the three realms are one mind only," etc. This explains consciousness-only with regard to the mundane world.

3. Explaining consciousness-only based on what is grasped and following the conditioned. The *Thirty Verses* states "through provisional explanations of self and dharmas," etc. Based on the essence of consciousness, the seeing and characteristic aspects arise, and the two attachments are generated. The mundane world and sacred teachings explain self and dharmas.

4. Explaining consciousness-only based on sentient beings. The *Vimalakīrti Sutra* states "because mind is pure, sentient beings are pure," etc.

5. Explaining consciousness-only based on all existent and non-existent phenomena. The *Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra* states "what all consciousnesses apprehend are only manifestations of consciousness," etc.

6. Explaining consciousness-only following the separate transformations of sentient beings in the four destinies. The *Abhidharma Sutra* states "hungry ghosts, animals, humans, gods," etc. This explains consciousness-only by pointing to one matter.

The chapter states: "Among such countless doctrinal approaches, these six approaches are raised to categorically encompass all teachings. What exhausts the principle and meaning is only the fifth teaching, because it comprehensively explains everything as consciousness-only." (The fifth teaching is the *Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra*. See private notes.)

**Lower Section**
**Eleventh Section: Also Explaining Three Types of Consciousness-Only**
1. Object consciousness-only. 2. Practice consciousness-only. 3. Fruition consciousness-only.

The chapter states: "Sometimes bundled into three: namely object, practice, and fruition. As extensively differentiated in the *Heart Sutra Profound Praise*."

This can be seen in reference to three types among the previous five types of consciousness-only. *Consciousness-Only Commentary* Volume 9 states: "In these stages, although one also cultivates and realizes other practices and other dharmas, because consciousness-only is fundamental and one cultivates other practices accordingly, one simply speaks of 'consciousness-only.'" *Profound Praise* Volume 1 states: "This consciousness-only cultivation comprehensively encompasses all practices, because all practices depend on consciousness-only cultivation."

**Twelfth Section: Four Levels of Definitive and Provisional**
1. Dharma-seal and non-seal approach. 2. Expressing permanent and impermanent approach.
3. Explicit and implicit approach. 4. Brief words and extensive language approach.

Explaining: The dharma-seal and non-seal approach means there are three dharma-seals. (First, all conditioned phenomena are impermanent; second, all phenomena are selfless; third, nirvana is quiescent. Sometimes adding "all contaminated phenomena are suffering," explaining four udānas. The three dharma-seals and four udānas are in the first fascicle of *Miscellaneous Dharma Approaches*.) If all Buddha teachings, both Mahayana and Hinayana, are sealed by these three types of principle-seals, they are called definitive meaning. All heretical teachings violate the three dharma-seals and are therefore provisional meaning. Through this, none of the three baskets, Two Vehicles, or twelve divisions of teaching are not definitive meaning, because they can abandon afflictions, karma, and suffering. All heretical teachings are not definitive meaning sutras because they cannot abandon delusions, karma, and suffering. The expressing permanent and impermanent approach means: if one says the Tathāgata is impermanent and subject to change, this is called provisional meaning, which is Hinayana teaching. If one says the Tathāgata is permanent and unchanging, this is called definitive meaning. (This is Mahayana.) The *Nirvana Sutra*

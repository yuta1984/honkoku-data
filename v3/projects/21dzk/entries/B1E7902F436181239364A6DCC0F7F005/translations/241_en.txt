The fifth states: Regarding sūtras, there are four in the four āgamas. 1. Saṃyuktāgama: This is where Buddha Bhagavat, observing those to be taught, proclaimed the Tathāgata's and disciples' teachings corresponding to aggregates, sense-spheres, and elements; corresponding dependent origination; or the four foundations of mindfulness, four right efforts, four bases of supernatural power, five faculties, five powers, seven factors of awakening, eightfold noble path, and inhalation-exhalation. Later compilers, to make the sacred teaching endure long, arranged them in sequence according to their appropriateness. Such correspondences briefly have three types: 1. The speaker - namely the Tathāgata and various disciples; 2. What is spoken - namely the dharmas to be understood such as aggregates and sense-spheres; 3. Those for whom it is spoken - namely monks and assemblies of gods, demons, etc. Roughly indicating all such matters and collecting them together is called Saṃyuktāgama. 2. Madhyamāgama: This takes the previous corresponding teachings and explains them with other teachings in a middle way. This is called Madhyamāgama. 3. Dīrghāgama: This takes those corresponding teachings and explains them extensively with other teachings. Therefore it's called Dīrghāgama. 4. Ekottarikāgama: This takes those corresponding teachings and explains them with the principle of gradually increasing numbers - one, two, three, etc. Therefore it's called Ekottarikāgama. These four types have been transmitted by teachers and disciples down to the present. Due to this principle, they are therefore called the four āgamas." *Baoen-jing* fascicle 6 states: "For gods and worldly people, teaching according to the time, collected as Ekottarika - this is what those who encourage and transform practice. For sharp-faculties beings, explaining various profound meanings is called Madhyamāgama - this is what scholars practice. Explaining various meditation methods is Saṃyuktāgama - this is what meditators practice. Refuting various heterodox schools is Dīrghāgama." *Yogācārabhūmi* fascicle 2 Phonetic Meanings (compiled by Xuanying) states: Āgama (also ā-gama, meaning 'teaching' or 'transmission' - successively transmitted and mutually taught. The old term āhan is a corruption and abbreviation).

**Section 39: Clarifying the Six Relatives**

*Brahmajāla-sūtra Commentary* (Taiken) states: father, mother, elder brother, younger brother, paternal uncle, maternal aunt.
*Renwang-jing Commentary* states: father, mother, elder brother, younger brother, husband, wife.

The above two explanations each have their reasons. The *Brahmajāla-sūtra's* meaning is the teaching of not violating the six relatives, so it excludes husband and wife. The *Renwang-jing's* meaning is the teaching of disharmony among six relatives, so it includes husband and wife. Therefore their perspectives differ but don't contradict each other.

**Section 40: Clarifying the Four Deportments**

Walking, standing, sitting, lying down. (Standing means to stand upright, namely dwelling. This is Master Jingxing's interpretation, which can be seen in the Eight-Fascicle Sūtra Commentary.)

Completed one proofreading as in the manuscript. This is to make the Dharma endure long, develop wisdom and understanding, and repay divine grace.

Conditioned dharmas of the three periods, etc. Second, unconditioned [dharmas] are not included in the three periods. Both have substantial existence. They gain their names from what they establish. The Haimavata (Snow-Rolling) school - because the Sthavira school was weak and not practiced, like snow drifting in wind without foundation, they take their name from this analogy. Also called the Haimavata (Snow Mountain), gaining their name from their dwelling place. Can also be called Sthavira (Elders). From what they inherited from afar, they established the school name of "Elders." The Vātsīputrīya (Calf-Son) school - in ancient times there was a sage who dwelled in a mountain hermitage and, driven by desire, was defiled by a mother cow and had offspring. All subsequent sage lineages of this type are called the Calf-Son school. They take their name from this distant origin. The Dharmottarīya (Dharma-Superior) school - there are dharmas that can be transcendent, or there are also dharmas that emerge above all people. Both are called the Dharma-Superior school. Named after the person. The Bhadrayānīya (Worthy Lineage) school - "Bhadra" (worthy) is the name of the school founder. "Yāna" means lineage or descendants. This is the lineage of a worthy arhat. Therefore they take their name from this inheritance. The Saṃmatīya (Correct Measure) school - weighing and determining is called "measure." The measure has no error or falsehood. Because of this it is "correct." This school's established profound dharma meanings have determinations without error. Therefore they are called "Correct Measure." They take their school name from the dharmas they establish. The Ṣaṇṇagarika (Dense Forest Mountain) school - the forest trees near the mountain are luxuriantly dense. They take their name from their location. The Mahīśāsaka (Earth-Transformation) school - the school founder's person was originally a king who controlled territorial domains. Because he transformed the people on earth, he is called "Earth-Transformer." He renounced his kingdom and became a monk, propagating and proclaiming the Buddha's dharma. Following his origin, he takes this as his designation. Called the Earth-Transformation school. The Dharmaguptaka (Dharma-Protector) school, also called the Dharma-Secret school - this is the school founder's name. "Gupta" (protector) and "secret" have largely the same meaning. This master contained and embraced the true dharma like a treasury. They establish their name following the person. Dharma-secret has the same meaning. The Kāśyapīya (Light-Drinker) school - in Sanskrit called "Kāśyapa," translated as "Light-Drinker." Of Brahmin nature. In ancient times there was a sage whose body had golden light. Because it eclipsed other lights, he was called "Light-Drinker." This school founder is his descendant, hence the name.

Moreover, this school founder's body has golden light and can drink light. They establish their name from this. The Sautrāntika (Sūtra-ists) school - this master's view is that the two periods of past and future have no substance, only the present truly exists. Venerable Vasumitra's doctrine is the same. Also called "Analogy-ists." Also called "Space-Void Theorists" because they consider space to have no substance or reality. Generally, they are people who do not establish space-characteristics. The *Lamp of Definitive Meaning* fascicle three states: "However, the *Abhidharmavibhāṣā* fascicle 38 says: 'Like the analogists, all conditioned characteristics are non-associated.'" These are the Sautrāntika masters. This master relies only on sūtras, taking only sūtras as the correct measure. They do not rely on vinaya or abhidhamma. The Sautrāntika masters established their school name based on what they advocate. (The above covers the origins of the twenty schools. See the *General Analysis Treatise*, *Lamp* fascicle one, *Comprehensive Commentary* fascicle one, and *School Wheel Treatise* for the same content. See the *Mañjuśrī-prajñāpāramitā*.)

Question: "How should the twenty schools be correlated with the eight doctrinal systems of 'both self and dharmas exist,' etc.?" Answer: "The first system encompasses six schools: Vātsīputrīya, Dharmottarīya, Bhadrayānīya, Saṃmatīya, Ṣaṇṇagarika, and Sautrāntika. The second system encompasses four schools: Sarvāstivāda, Bahuśrutīya, Haimavata, and Kāśyapīya. The third system encompasses seven schools: Mahāsāṃghika, Kaukkuṭika, Caitika, Aparaśaila, Uttaraśaila, Mahīśāsaka, and Dharmaguptaka. The fourth system encompasses [missing text] along with the fifth and sixth - three doctrinal systems. As their names indicate, each encompasses its own school: the Prajñaptivāda, Lokottaravāda, and Ekavyavahārika schools each originally had differences within their own schools, so they are included accordingly. The seventh and eighth systems represent Mahāyāna thinking. This is easy to understand."

Question: "The five schools of Vātsīputrīya etc. lack the aggregates of faculties, while the Sautrāntika school has them. Moreover, their theories of self are completely different. Why are they all grouped together in the first system?" Answer: "We base this on partial similarities, not claiming complete agreement. Also, while their specific concepts of self differ, they generally agree on the existence of self. Regarding this as one system, there is no error."

The twenty schools are offshoots and later teachings of Sāṃkhya non-Buddhism. Vaiśeṣika non-Buddhism is also likewise. The *Brahmajāla-sūtra Commentary* states: "Commentary on eighteen schools. Dharmatrāta says: First, Mahāsāṃghika... twentieth, Sautrāntika. Explanation: Among the twenty schools, Mahāsāṃghika and Sthavira are fundamental. The rest are derivative. When we say 'eighteen schools,' we exclude the original two and take the remaining eighteen. Fundamental and derivative together make twenty schools. The outline follows the *School Wheel Treatise* and Master Ji's commentary explanations." The *Brahmajāla-sūtra Commentary* states: "In Sanskrit 'Mahāsaṃgha,' translated as 'Great Assembly.' This is the name of the assembly leader outside the city." Master Ji's *Different Schools Wheel Commentary* of the Mahāyāna states: "This school's founder was originally a king. Because he transformed people on earth, it is called the Earth-Transformation school. In Sanskrit 'Mahīśāsaka,' translated as 'Earth-Transformation Above.' (Emerging from the Sthavira school.)" "Kāśyapa," translated as "Light-Drinker school." Also called "Good Years." This master was young in years, virtuous in nature and character. Therefore the name was established. Hence "Good Years" - praising his having virtuous conduct at a young age. Emerging from the Sthavira school. The *Western Regions Record* fascicle nine states: "After two or three months of completely collecting the Tripiṭaka, because Mahākāśyapa was the senior elder in the saṃgha, it was therefore called the Sthavira school." Also states: "Various learned and beyond-learning disciples, hundreds and thousands, who did not participate in Mahākāśyapa's compilation assembly, came here and discussed among themselves saying: 'When the Tathāgata was alive, we learned from the same teacher. The Dharma King has entered nirvana and distinguishes us differently. Wanting to repay the Buddha's kindness, we should compile the Dharma treasury,' etc. This was an assembly of ordinary people and saints, where the foolish and wise all gathered. They again compiled the Sūtra, Vinaya, Abhidhamma, Miscellaneous Collection, and Prohibitive Incantation treasuries, separately making five treasuries. This compilation was a joint assembly of ordinary people and saints. Therefore it was called the Mahāsāṃghika school." The *General Analysis Zhou Record* states: "Dharma-

Superior means this master calculated and said: 'All the various dharmas practiced by our school have none that surpass them.' This is called 'Dharma-Superior.' 'Worthy Lineage' means descendants. In ancient times there was a sage, greatly worthy and excellent. This is a worthy person's lineage, hence called 'Worthy Lineage.' 'Correct Measure' has the meaning of standard determination. The dharmas practiced here can correctly make standard determinations. This is 'Correct Measure.' Dense Forest Mountain refers to the mountain where this school founder resided, where the tree forests were luxuriant and dense. Called the Forest Mountain school. The remaining school names can be seen accordingly." The *Supreme [Sūtra] Sound and Meaning* and *Great Prajñāpāramitā Sound Training* have the same meaning. I privately state: The *General Analysis Treatise Private Record* has a master's doctrine using the character 'cao,' but nevertheless taking the character 'zhou' (lineage) as correct is the reason for using the 'zhou' character.

**Tenth: Clarifying the Twenty Schools Generally Bundled into Eleven Categories**

First: The four schools of Mahāsāṃghika, Ekavyavahārika, Lokottaravāda, and Kaukkuṭika teach: All Tathāgatas have no contaminated dharmas. Buddha's body and lifespan are entirely without limit. The five consciousness bodies have defilement. The formless realm completely possesses the six consciousness bodies. The five types of material faculties have flesh masses as their substance. One momentary mind comprehends all dharmas. Path and afflictions can both manifest simultaneously.

Second: The Bahuśrutīya school teaches: The Buddha's five sounds are supramundane teaching. The rest are worldly. The five sound teachings are: 1) impermanence, 2) suffering, 3) emptiness, 4) no-self, 5) nirvana tranquility. Other doctrines are largely the same as the Sarvāstivāda school.

Third: The Prajñaptivāda school teaches: Suffering is not the aggregates. The twelve sense-bases are not truly real. Through merit one attains the noble path. The path cannot be cultivated. Other doctrines are largely the same as Mahāsāṃghika calculations.

Fourth: The three schools of Caitika, Aparaśaila, and Uttaraśaila teach: Bodhisattvas do not escape evil...

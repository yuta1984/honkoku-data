[The queen is] soft and pliable. In cold times she provides warmth, in hot times she provides coolness. When the king sees the queen, he is freed from all fatigue, hunger, thirst, worry and affliction, and receives the supreme, first, limitless bliss. She also has five virtues: First, she remembers and never goes against the king's wishes. Second, she can give birth to a thousand sons completely. Third, she is naturally noble and honorable by nature. Fourth, she can make their dwelling place completely furnished with all necessities of life. Fifth, when the king enjoys sensual pleasures with his consorts, she does not give rise to jealousy, hatred, resentment, or evil thoughts.

The wish-fulfilling gem has eight kinds of virtues: First, in the darkness of night it emits great radiance, like the light of the autumn full moon, able to illuminate one hundred yojanas. Even in summer days, when sentient beings suffer from heat, it emits light that touches their bodies and provides coolness. Second, when the king travels through wilderness without water and sentient beings are hungry and thirsty, the jewel emits meritorious water with eight flavors to satisfy hunger and thirst. Third, whatever the king requires all comes forth from the wish-fulfilling treasure. Fourth, it has eight angular faces, and from each face various lights emerge. Fifth, wherever it is located, it can cause all sentient beings within one hundred yojanas to be free from illness and suffering, constantly maintaining a concentrated mind. Their good deeds are never performed in vain. Sixth, in its dwelling realm there are no evil dragons that can emit poisonous vapors, lightning, wind, or rain to harm sentient beings. Seventh, all mountain streams, valleys, ditches, ravines, and dried springs are revived, and withered trees, forests, grasses, flowers, and fruits are made to flourish. Ponds, waters, and flower groves become completely perfect. Eighth, where it resides, people have no epidemics or poisons, no untimely deaths. Even among animals, tigers, wolves and such that devour each other do not give rise to harmful thoughts.

The wheel treasure has five kinds of virtues: First, the wheel treasure's substance is pure Jambu gold, equipped with a thousand wheels, five yojanas wide, manifesting in the world like a second sun. Second, it flies through empty space with nothing able to obstruct it, and can travel eight thousand yojanas in one day. Third, it follows the king's mental intentions.

When [the king] wishes to travel the four continents, following where the king's mind dwells, it immediately flies through empty space and goes ahead. Relying on the wheel's power, the four armies, elephants, horses, vehicles and such all fly up and depart together. Fourth, when there are those who do not submit to the wheel-turning king, if the king mentally concentrates, that wheel treasure follows where his mind focuses, immediately flies away, and causes complete submission. Fifth, the wheel treasure's power has no opposition. All lesser kings who see it submit.

The elephant treasure's virtue: That great elephant treasure is like a fine horse - tamed, gentle, and following autonomous use. It subdues other countries, with seven limbs well-established. That elephant is stable in three places for use: namely empty space, in water, and on land pools. That elephant can move swiftly, circumambulating Jambudvīpa three times in one day. When the wheel-turning king rides the elephant, the elephant accords with the king's mind, following wherever the king's mind dwells, immediately following and departing. Its gait is level and straight like a goose king - neither hurried nor slow, neither crooked nor askew. Moving among ordinary people without causing alarm. In times of battle, it can manifest extremely fierce and harmful appearances, becoming unapproachable.

The horse treasure's virtue: Its color is white like the kumuda flower, with celestial wheel marks pervading its bodily characteristics. Neither small nor large, neither tall nor short. Its body is properly proportioned with a gentle nature, well-tamed like Indra's Balāhaka horse, going and staying according to will. It travels around Jambudvīpa three times in one day without signs of fatigue.

The minister's virtue: He governs on behalf of the king exactly like the king's mind. He worries about the country while forgetting himself, not engaging in private affairs. He protects and cares for the people, accomplishing immediately whatever he contemplates. Without hindrance or attachment, he cultivates the correct path and stays away from non-dharmic [actions].

The treasurer's virtue: That royal treasurer has great merit. All mountains, deep ravines, secluded valleys, wilderness, rivers, marshes, hills, mounds, pits, and uneven high and low places can be completely filled using diamond

treasures, Indra treasures, and all precious gems. Yet the treasures are never exhausted. Needless to say, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal are countless. That treasurer is always joyful in mind without any deceptive characteristics.

Question: Among the seven treasures, how many are sentient and how many non-sentient?
Answer: The jewel and wheel are the two non-sentient treasures. The remaining five are sentient beings.

This can be seen in *Abhidharmakośa-bhāṣya* fascicle 4, end. *Abhidharmakośa* fascicle 12 is the same as this.

Also asked: What is the meaning of the transformative virtue of the seven treasures?
Answer: *Sārvajanikāya Sūtra* fascicle 3 says: The wheel-turning sage king is endowed with seven treasures: first, queen treasure (up to) seventh, treasurer treasure. Their transformative virtue is: with that wheel treasure and seven treasures complete, he travels throughout the great earth with no opposition, no resentment or judgment, no afflictions, no swords or staffs. Relying on correct conduct, equal without partiality, he comforts and subdues, ruling the four continents, gaining sovereignty. Therefore his issued commands have no opposition. With the ten good paths he transforms the four continents, causing all to accept and maintain them. They leave the ten evil karmas, practice the ten good paths, and with complete accomplishment are called dharma kings.

Question: By what causes are the seven treasures that are experienced brought about?
Answer: They are obtained by departing from angry minds and unwholesome karmic paths. If so, why does the *Renwang Sutra* speak of "superior ten good deeds iron wheel king, etc."?
Answer: That sutra speaks completely. This is based on superior excellence, so there is no fault.

*Renwang Sutra*, upper fascicle, says: Ten good bodhisattvas arouse great minds, permanently separating from the suffering wheel-ocean of the three realms. Medium and lower grade good [beings become] grain-of-sand kings. Superior ten good [beings become] iron wheel kings. Practice-seed [stage becomes] copper wheel [ruling] two continents. Silver wheel three heavens [is the] nature-lineage. Path-seed firm virtue wheel kings [have] seven treasures with golden light [ruling] four continents.

*Mahāprajñāpāramitā*

**Lower Section**

Fascicle 46, section 10 says: Subhūti, you should know: like that wheel-turning king, if there are no seven treasures, he is not called a wheel-turning king. It is essential to have seven treasures to be called a wheel-turning king. The five pāramitās of giving and so forth are also like this. If separated from prajñāpāramitā, they cannot be called pāramitās. Not separated from prajñāpāramitā, they can then be called pāramitās.

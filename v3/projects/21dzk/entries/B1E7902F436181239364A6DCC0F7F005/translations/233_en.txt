This sūtra does not follow the sequence of those sixteen assemblies. Explanation: This sūtra should logically follow that sequence and should also comprehensively explain the other divisions. However, those who translate sūtras simply explain four divisions according to what they have heard. The "four locations" are: 1) Rājagṛha's Vulture Peak Mountain, 2) Śrāvastī's Jetavana Grove and Anāthapiṇḍada's Garden, 3) In the jeweled palace of Paranirmita-vaśavartin Heaven, 4) Beside the White Heron Pond in Rājagṛha's Bamboo Grove. They explain the perfection of wisdom (prajñāpāramitā). The "sixteen assemblies" are detailed in separate records. Now judging the sixteen assemblies, there are three sections. The first five assemblies, from extensive to abbreviated, all explain the six perfections. Although the texts have extensive and abbreviated portions, the meaning has no broad or narrow differences. Therefore Bodhisattva Nāgārjuna relied on the second assembly to compose the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra*. Next there are five assemblies that are difficult to determine. Later there are six assemblies that explain the six perfections in sequence. However, the sixteen assemblies do not include this one division because the Tathāgata's teachings vary according to the capacities of beings.

**Chapter 12: The Eight Aspects of the Transformation Body Tathāgata's Path to Enlightenment** (*Xuanzan* fascicle 3 and *Sheshaku* explain this in detail - they can be consulted)

1. Descending from heaven (entering the womb aspect), 2. Infancy (birth aspect, also called emerging from womb), 3. Childhood (desire aspect), 4. Ascetic practices, 5. Attaining enlightenment, 6. Defeating Māra, 7. Turning the Dharma wheel, 8. Entering nirvāṇa.

As explained in *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra* fascicle 568.

Also stated: 1. Manifesting descent from the divine palace, 2. Receiving birth, 3. Receiving desires, 4. Leaving the city to become a monk, 5. Practicing various austerities, 6. Realizing great bodhi, 7. Turning the great Dharma wheel, 8. Entering nirvāṇa.

**Lower Section**

This is the meaning of *Mahāyāna-saṃgraha*.

*Trikāya Chapter* says: The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra* lacks the renunciation aspect mentioned in *Mahāyāna-saṃgraha* but adds the aspect of defeating Māra. *Mahāyāna-saṃgraha* includes the aspect of defeating Māra within the enlightenment aspect. Enlightenment separates from the three māras; defeating Māra subdues one. Also, immediately after attaining enlightenment, Māra is defeated. First showing renunciation, then practicing austerities - the treatise establishes these separately. Also, that treatise's renunciation shows the aspect of renouncing the mundane; austerities show the aspect of practicing wrong practices. The sūtra combines them because renunciation leads to practicing austerities. The sūtra practices the path to realize fruition and defeats Māra to eliminate enemies, so they are established separately. Each is based on one meaning and they don't contradict each other.

*Awakening of Faith* says: By seeing the Dharma body, according to one's vow-power, one can manifest eight types to benefit beings: departing from Tuṣita Heaven, entering the womb, dwelling in the womb, emerging from the womb, renunciation, attaining enlightenment, turning the great Dharma wheel, entering nirvāṇa. However, this bodhisattva is not yet called the Dharma body.

Vasubandhu's *Mahāyāna-saṃgraha* fascicle 9 says: The treatise states, commentary says... The wisdom of accomplishing activities means the ability to manifest from descending from Tuṣita Heaven palace up to nirvāṇa, various Buddha activities, all attaining mastery.

**Chapter 13: Six Types of Trembling**

There are also three types: 1. Six-time trembling, 2. Six-direction trembling (*Xuanzan* fascicle 10, separate extract fascicle 6 can be consulted), 3. Six-aspect trembling.

1. Eastern surging, western subsiding, 2. Western surging, eastern subsiding, 3. Southern surging, northern subsiding, 4. Northern surging, southern subsiding, 5. Central surging, peripheral subsiding, 6. Peripheral surging, central subsiding.

Also: 1. Moving, extremely moving, equally extremely moving, 2. Surging, extremely surging, equally extremely surging, 3. Shaking,

**Left Page**

Extremely shaking, equally extremely shaking, 4. Striking, extremely striking, equally extremely striking, 5. Roaring, extremely roaring, equally extremely roaring, 6. Erupting, extremely erupting, equally extremely erupting (eighteen aspects of movement).

*Xuanzan* fascicle 2 says: Shaking means moving, arising. The six movements have three types. According to *Dīrghāgama*: 1. Six-time movement: entering the womb, renunciation, enlightenment, turning the Dharma wheel, entering nirvāṇa. 2. Six-direction movement, as explained in *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra* fascicle 8: eastern surging western subsiding... (up to) peripheral surging central subsiding. 3. Six-aspect movement, as explained in *Mahāprajñāpāramitā*: moving, surging, shaking, striking, roaring, erupting. Swaying unsteadily is moving; scaled ridges and depressions are surging, or the appearance and disappearance in six directions is called surging. Having hidden sounds is shaking. The old fourth says ascending from low to high is rising; now it says having something broken is striking. Making booming sounds is roaring. The old sixth says causing awakening is awakening; now it says emitting sounds that startle is erupting. Each has three types, called the eighteen aspects of movement. The *Prajñā-sūtra* says: moving, equally moving, equally extremely moving... up to erupting, equally erupting, equally extremely erupting. Slight movement is called moving; universal movement everywhere is called equal movement; universal great tilting movement is called equally extreme movement. The rest should be understood accordingly. This raises the general category, simply called six movements. This is only one trembling among the eighteen transformations. The *Śreṣṭhacintā Brahmā-sūtra* explains seven causes: 1. Frightening various māras, 2. Preventing the assembly from arising scattered minds, 3. Making negligent ones self-awaken, 4. Making them contemplate dharma characteristics, 5. Making them observe the teaching location, 6. Making accomplished ones attain liberation, 7. Making them follow and accord with correct meaning.

*Mahāprajñāpāramitā Phonetic Commentary* fascicle 1 says: Six types of transformation movement... Personal analysis: Among the six transformation movements, there are eighteen types: 1. Moving, 2.

**Lower Section**

Extremely moving, 3. Equally extremely moving. The next five types also each have three, therefore making 3×6=18. Moving one thousand worlds is called moving; moving two thousand worlds is called extremely moving; moving three thousand worlds is called equally extremely moving. The latter five follow this pattern. From light to heavy, the sequence is thus.

*Renwang-jing Commentary* upper fascicle says (Ximing): Clarifying the six types of earthquake briefly has four meanings: 1. Clarifying movement characteristics, 2. Revealing movement causes, 3. Distinguishing movement realms, 4. Explaining movement intentions. Regarding movement, according to the old *Avataṃsaka* fascicle 2, it clarifies the movement characteristics of arising movement, etc.: moving, universally moving, equally universally moving, arising awakening, shaking, roaring, surging - all have complete three characteristics. Only movement should be understood... If following *Avataṃsaka* fascicle 36 Tathāgata Nature Arising chapter, there are specifically two types of six characteristics: 1. Moving, arising, etc. six, 2. Eastern surging western subsiding... (up to) central surging peripheral subsiding. Explanation: These latter six type characteristics are as explained in *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* fascicle 10. Why are there six movements? Answer: Arising movement has upper, middle, lower. Lower has two types: either eastern surging western subsiding, or southern surging northern subsiding, or peripheral surging central subsiding. Middle has four: either east-west-south-north, or east-north-peripheral-central, or south-north-peripheral-central. Upper has six types of movement. If following the new *Avataṃsaka*, it differs from the previous. It says: At that time, through the Buddha's awesome power, universally pervading all Flower Treasury World Ocean, six types of earthquake: shaking, universally shaking, universally pervading shaking; moving, universally moving, universally pervading moving; surging, universally surging, universally pervading surging; operating, universally operating, universally pervading operating; roaring, universally roaring, universally pervading roaring; striking, universally striking, universally pervading striking. Explanation: Initial movement is shaking; great movement, jumping up and down is surging; making hidden sounds is operating; gradually making loud sounds is roaring; mutually drumming and striking with increasingly loud sounds is striking.

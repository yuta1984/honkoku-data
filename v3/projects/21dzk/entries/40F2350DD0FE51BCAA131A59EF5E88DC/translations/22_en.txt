limits." (Either general explanation or separate explanation) Beyond this, each ground has distinct virtues, their appearance and disappearance are not fixed. Observers should grasp the meaning. "Good-awakening bodhisattva" - the new edition says "joyful bodhisattva." "Dual illumination of two truths equal path" - the new edition says "initially illuminating two truths equal principle." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Depending on the ultimate truth to explain dual contemplation has two meanings: first, entering contemplation to see the true; second, emerging to see the conventional. Combining entry and exit, hence called dual contemplation." Master Cien says: "Simultaneously conditioning both, hence named dual contemplation." However, this dual contemplation has briefly four types: first, provisional contemplation - namely in the four good roots position within the ten dedications, conditioning names and meanings etc. in one instant. Having both provisional existence and substantial non-existence - provisional existence is conventional, substantial non-existence is true. Within this, initial practice allows for sequence. If in the mature position, then dual contemplation is attained. Second, realization position dual contemplation, like this sutra. Third, effortful dual contemplation, namely the hard-to-conquer ground. Fourth, spontaneous dual contemplation from the eighth ground up. Now within this is realization position dual contemplation. If following the mountain school, from the distinct teaching's first ground up is three contemplations in one mind. Now saying "dual illumination of two truths" is like the Śamatha-vipaśyanā clarifying the third contemplation: "Using two contemplations as expedient means to enter the middle way ultimate meaning truth. Dual illumination of two truths, mind-moments extinguished, naturally flowing into the ocean of omniscience." "Entering principle prajñā called dwelling etc." - Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Explaining grounds' distinct name-meanings. Namely also called dwelling because wisdom dwells in principle. Also called ground because it generates various virtues." "Complete virtue practices" (new edition says "complete various virtues") - Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "First ground's one thought completes eighty-four thousand pāramitās." "Separation-attainment enlightened being" - new edition says "stainless bodhisattva without conditions without characteristics." "Third truth" - new edition says "without characteristics without conditions true reality characteristics." "Without-without, without-arising, without-dual illumination" - new edition says "without-essence, without-arising, without-dual illumination." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Explaining this sutra text, various explanations differ."

[Page 44, Lower]
One record says: "Upper line clarifies realm purity, lower line clarifies wisdom purity. Speaking of 'without conditions' - other-dependent provisional conditions are empty. Without characteristics - discriminated provisional characteristics are empty. Third truth - true reality nature empty. Explaining: eliminating the three natures, preserving the three no-natures." Speaking of "without-without" - this negates discrimination, because nature has no essence. Speaking of "without-arising" - other-dependent nature empty. Speaking of "without-dual illumination" - perfect nature empty. However this word applies to both above. Master Cien says: "Upper line realm purity, lower line wisdom purity. Following previous explanation. Speaking of 'without conditions' - arising has no inherent nature. Essence is other-dependent. Because there's no arising from conditions like Īśvara etc. Speaking of 'without characteristics' - characteristics having no inherent nature, namely grasped characteristics. Because having no substance as its essence. Speaking of 'third truth' - supreme meaning having no inherent nature. True-thusness as essence. Because without grasped true-emptiness characteristics." Explaining purifying wisdom should be known following the previous. I say: "Using two lines to distinguish realm and wisdom." Master Dōeki agrees. This meaning is good. Moreover, three natures and three no-natures are golden mouth teachings. Examining new and old editions, this explanation follows the text. Though not our school's explanation, why not also use it? Moreover, those three no-natures are identical to our three contemplations. Initially eliminating the imagined - how is this not identical emptiness? Next obstructing false attachments while preserving sentient beings. Later eliminating the imagined without obstructing the perfected. These two are respectively provisional and middle. This establishes three truths corresponding to three no-natures. Also saying: "This text only clarifies the third truth. Without conditions - having no saṃsāra false conditions is obstructing the provisional. Without characteristics - having no nirvāṇa true characteristics is obstructing emptiness. Obstructing emptiness and provisional reveals the middle. This is called the third truth." Regarding "without-without etc." - the first fascicle says: "Without-without doesn't grasp empty characteristics. Without-arising doesn't grasp existing characteristics." Now assisting in clarifying:

[Page 45, Upper]
"This obstructs partial emptiness and partial provisional. Using non-duality to illuminate the middle." Question: "New edition says 'without essence,' old edition says 'without-without' - how are they same or different?" Answer: (possibly missing characters). "Bright wisdom empty illumination" - new edition says "radiant bodhisattva." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Marking the name." "Patient mind without duality etc." - new edition says "skillfully penetrating samādhi, hidden and manifest sovereignty, complete with three clarities." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Patient mind is the contemplating wisdom. Without duality means departing from existence-nonexistence dual characteristics. Using non-duality as the third truth. Exiting existence means exiting three realm existence. Entering nonexistence means entering transformational birth. Transformational birth (possibly missing 'transformation' character) means changing birth-death." I say: "Exiting existence entering nonexistence etc. doesn't follow the sutra text." Master Dōeki says: "Patient mind is contemplation essence. Using non-dual patience to illuminate equal three. Exiting existence entering nonexistence - this is not the two vehicles' entering true exiting conventional entry-exit. This is the great being's immediate tranquility yet functioning hence exiting, immediate functioning yet tranquil hence entering. Now clarifying tranquil yet able to function, hence called transformational birth." Master Jizang says: "Conditioning existence transforming beings without attachment - this is exiting existence. In existence knowing emptiness is called entering nonexistence. Spiritual powers' transformations hence called transformational birth." "Good-awakening separation bright three-path persons" - new edition says "joyful, stainless, and radiant." "Able to extinguish three realms' form-afflictions etc." - new edition says "able to extinguish form-bondage various afflictions." Master Jizang says: "This place is transformational form-afflictions." I say: "Difficult to determine." "Again contemplating three realms etc." - new edition says "completely contemplating all body-speech-mind dharma-nature pure illumination all complete." Master Jizang says: "Body-speech-form are transformational form" (I say: "Transformational form is difficult to determine"). Contemplating form as identical to dharma-nature hence no remaining illumination. Master Dōeki says: "Being deluded about dharma-nature, attached to three realm bodies generates form-afflictions. Now again contemplating body as identical to dharma-nature, hence form-delusions naturally extinguish. Therefore Vimalakīrti says: 'Though practicing in

[Page 45, Lower]
three realms without destroying dharma-nature.' Because dharma-nature is pervasive, illumination also has no remaining illumination. Having no remaining (possibly missing 'illumination' character), naturally no delusions remain unexhausted." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Again contemplating dharma-nature ultimate true-thusness on three realm body-speech-form having no remaining illumination, hence able to sever." The first fascicle says: "Without-conditions (possibly 'conditions' character) samādhi able to illuminate dharma-nature." I say: "Should be contemplated."

Sutra: "Blazing wisdom marvelous light great vigor... up to again contemplating mind-emptiness immeasurable rewards"

Master Dōeki says: "Text has two parts: first six verses separate hymns, latter two verses general hymns. Within the separate, three grades each have two verses." "Blazing wisdom marvelous light" - new edition says "blazing wisdom bodhisattva." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Marking grounds' distinct names." "Great vigor" - below the ten perfections corresponding to ten grounds as usual can be known. "True wisdom conditioned tranquility expedient means" - new edition says "true wisdom extinction expedient wisdom." Master Dōeki says: "Four characters true wisdom, three characters provisional wisdom." "Attaining no-arising illuminating emptiness-existence completion" - new edition says "attaining no-arising principle illuminating emptiness-existence." Master Jizang says: "True characteristics contemplate emptiness. Expedient means illuminates existence. Hence saying attaining no-arising illuminating emptiness-existence completion." I say: "Someone reads this text as illuminating emptiness's existence." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Again explaining two wisdoms. Attaining no-arising explains the above true wisdom. Illuminating emptiness-existence-emptiness completion explains subsequent wisdom universally illuminating true and conventional." "Supreme wisdom three truths self-attained clarity" - new edition says "hard-to-conquer bodhisattva attaining fundamental etc." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "True-conventional two wisdoms are hard to unite yet able to unite, hence called hard-to-conquer. Now this sutra's meaning comprehends true-conventional and ultimate meaning. Being able to comprehend is called supreme wisdom." "Empty-empty truth etc." - new edition says "empty-empty truth contemplation without dual characteristics transforming six paths none not identical." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "The fundamental record says: regarding ultimate truth emptiness there are two meanings: first person-emptiness, second dharma-emptiness, hence called empty-empty."

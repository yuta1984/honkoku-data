One jō (ten feet) becomes long when compared to nine shaku (feet), and is called short when compared to one and a half jō. Therefore, long and short are indefinite. The same applies to high and low. Regarding "like the five colors, etc.": Master Ye says this refers to mutually dependent dharmas. Master Ce agrees. Master Zang says: "Five colors" means five characteristics, also called "blue, yellow, red, white, and mixed colors." Master Ben says: There are two ways to clarify mutual dependence provisional. First, clarifying observational dependence provisional; second, clarifying formal dependence provisional. First, let's clarify the first observational dependence provisional.

Scripture: "All dharmas are mutually dependent—namely form-sphere, eye-sphere, eye-consciousness-sphere, up to mind-sphere, mind-consciousness-sphere, like lightning." (New scripture text) Explanation: "All dharmas are mutually dependent" is the general indication. "Dependence" means relying upon. That is, aggregates, sense-spheres, and sense-realms—all conditioned dharmas do not arise without conditions. They mutually depend and rely. "Namely form-sphere, eye-sphere, eye-consciousness-sphere" clarifies the characteristics of dependence. That is, the three categories of eye [organ], object, and consciousness are not the same. When any are mutually lacking, consciousness definitely does not arise. When objects properly appear before us, organs properly generate consciousness, and consciousness properly comprehends objects, they must mutually rely and depend to achieve illuminating understanding. "Up to" and what follows uses later examples to illustrate the middle cases. All possess the three harmonies, clarifying dependence and reliance. "Like lightning" concludes that it doesn't last long—because it's provisional, not real; because it immediately ceases and becomes nothing.

From here, second, clarifying formal dependence provisional. Scripture: "Indefinite mutual dependence, existence-nonexistence, oneness-difference, like a second moon." (New scripture text) Explanation: "Indefinite mutual dependence" is the initial indication. The formal dependence of all dharmas—good-ugly, high-low, long-short, etc.—regarding form and mind formal dependence, all are indefinite. "Existence-nonexistence, oneness-difference": "Existence" doesn't exist by itself—it exists because it depends on non-existence. "Non-existence" doesn't not-exist by itself—it doesn't exist because it depends on existence. Oneness and difference are the same. They mutually formally depend and have no fixed substance. Also, borrowing existence to form non-existence, obtaining non-existence to dismiss existence; depending on non-existence to observe existence, establishing existence to remove non-existence. They alternately go back and forth, both lacking substance. Oneness and difference are the same. Therefore, the Ghanavyūha

verse says: "Worldly false discrimination sees rabbits, etc. as having horns. Not understanding that horns are non-existent, because of words they say rabbit horns are non-existent. Analyzing down to the atomic level, seeking horns finds nothing existing. Necessarily arising regarding existent dharmas and arising regarding non-existence views." Question: Are these existences and non-existences before and after of one dharma, or do two dharmas simultaneously mutually formally depend? Answer: Existence and non-existence are simultaneous. Dependence is only one dharma. Like taking one jō and comparing it to one and a half jō, etc.—that one jō has short characteristics. Compared to five shaku, etc., it has no short characteristics but has long characteristics. Therefore, that one jō's short and long dual characteristics both lack substance. Therefore, one dharma's before and after should be understood by this example. "Like a second moon" concludes the lack of real substance. (The above are various masters' explanations—readers should accept or reject them)

I privately rely on the new version to examine the old scripture: Mutually dependent provisional dharmas have roughly two categories. First, mutual dependence of sense-organs, objects, etc.—what Master Ben calls "observational dependence provisional." Second, mutual dependence of existence-nonexistence, etc.—what Master Ben calls "formal dependence provisional." From "mutual dependence" to "indefinite mutual dependence" indicates the two provisional names. From "like five" to "equal dharmas" points to those two dharmas. "Five colors, etc." refers to sense-organs, objects, and consciousness. "Five" has three fives—meaning sense-organs, objects, and consciousness each having five. "Colors" first raises one object to equal the remaining fourteen. The meaning is: sense-organs are not independent organs—they mutually depend on objects and consciousness. Objects and consciousness are the same. They mutually depend on each other. This also generally reveals one aspect—everything is like this. Otherwise, one should say "colors and other five dharmas." However, saying "five colors" is this scripture's example, like the text below saying "five hundred billion Subhūti, Śāriputra, etc." "Existence-nonexistence, all equal, etc." refers to dharmas of existence-nonexistence, oneness-difference, long-short, etc. That this is called "indefinite mutual dependence"—scholars should consider.

Scripture: "All dharmas are conditionally formed provisional, forming sentient beings" (The new version says: "All dharmas are conditionally formed—aggregate, sense-sphere, and sense-realm dharmas like bubbles on water")
Master Ce says: Sixth, explaining conditionally formed provisional.

【Page 61 Upper】
Scripture: "Simultaneous cause-effect, sequential cause-effect, three-period good-evil" (The new version says: "All dharmas are cause-formed, all sentient beings' simultaneous cause-effect, sequential cause-effect, three-period good-evil like clouds in space")

Master Ce says: Seventh, cause-formed provisional. Master Ye establishes six provisionals and doesn't separately establish this seventh cause-formed. (I privately say: Seven provisionals accord with the new version text. Master Ben relies on the new to establish seven provisionals)

Scripture: "All illusions and transformations are illusory truth sentient beings"

Master Ce says: The above has already finished explaining that the transformed are like illusions. This is the second conclusion establishing that the transformed are like illusions. (I privately say: Taking this text as the general conclusion carefully obtains the scripture's meaning. Scholars should consider)

Scripture: "Great King, if bodhisattvas..." up to "are like this" (The new version says: "Good sons, bodhisattva mahāsattvas dwell in non-discrimination, without characteristics of that-this, without characteristics of self-other, always practicing beneficial transformation without characteristics of beneficial transformation. Therefore one should know: like foolish people's defiled consciousness, being attached to falsity and bound by characteristics. Bodhisattvas illuminate and see, knowing like illusory magicians having no substantial characteristics, merely like space-flowers. This is called bodhisattva mahāsattvas dwelling in benefiting self and others, truly observing")

Master Ce says: Concluding that the capable transformers are like illusions. Master Ye says: Concluding the establishment of illusory provisional sentient beings. (I privately say: If following the new version, one should say that both capable transformers and transformed objects are completely like illusions)

Scripture: "At that time, various existences..." up to "virtuous practices" (The character "various" appears in Master Zang's citation but not in Masters Ce and Ye's citations. However, this character has no clear meaning—readers may decide for themselves. The new version says: "When this dharma was explained, countless human and celestial beings in the assembly obtained forbearance tolerance and emptiness non-arising tolerance. Countless bodhisattvas from the first ground, second ground up to the tenth ground obtained one-life-remaining status")

The assembly (The two characters "time assembly" examined against "great assembly"—possibly a copying error of three characters) obtained benefits. "Forbearance tolerance" refers to the three worthies. (The commentary says "three worthies" with no different interpretation) Regarding "obtaining emptiness non-arising tolerance": Master Ye says obtaining emptiness is from the first ground up. Master Zang says emptiness tolerance is from the fourth ground up. Regarding non-arising tolerance: Masters Zang and Ye both say "seventh ground and up." Master Ce says emptiness non-arising tolerance generally exists in the ten grounds. Regarding "up to first ground, tenth ground, etc.": Master Ye says: How could only real wisdom certify emptiness, non-arising, etc.? Moreover, also expedient

【Page 61 Lower】
wisdom ground by ground certifies ineffable distinct merits. Master Zang says: The first ground is called "first ground"; dharma-cloud is called "tenth ground." Being vast like empty space is called "ineffable (one version writes 'inconceivable') virtue." Master Ce says: The later "up to, etc." refers to the ground-attainment approach—meaning through the power of hearing teachings, one can attain from first ground up to tenth ground.

I privately say: If judging emptiness [possibly missing the character "non-" below "emptiness"] arising as above-ground merits, it still doesn't accord with the text "up to first ground, tenth ground, etc." Now I say: In explaining the ten firm minds above, there are emptiness tolerance and non-arising tolerance. Therefore, borrowing this text's meaning: There are those who first obtain forbearance tolerance; there are those who obtain that later mind's emptiness non-arising tolerance; up to those who enter first ground and tenth ground.

Ninnō护国 Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra Chapter Four: Two Truths

I privately say: The Tendai school establishes seven-fold two truths, as detailed in the Lotus Sūtra Profound Meaning. However, the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra has three teaching meanings. One should explain this chapter's two truths using those latter six levels. Master Ye says: Tendai says "Two vehicles take real existence as conventional, real existence's cessation as ultimate. Mahāyāna takes illusory existence as conventional, illusory existence being immediately empty as ultimate." This is the second of the seven levels. What various masters explain cannot be extensively quoted.

Scripture: "At that time, King Prasenajit..." up to "end of chapter"

Master Ce's meaning: Broadly divided into five parts. First, question-answer distinguishing separate two truths and non-dual. Second, "addressed the Buddha" and below—question and answer. Third, "addressed the Buddha" and below—question-answer distinguishing separate dharma-gates and non-dual. Fourth, "Great King, seven Buddhas" and below—praising the scripture's merits. Fifth, "Great King, this scripture" and below—praising the name and encouraging maintenance. Master Ye says: The text has two parts—first, question-answer distinguishing...

showing what can protect. Regarding "this is for, etc.," the text is not easy to read. However, the Great Sutra says: "If bodhisattvas uphold the twelve-section sutras, whether reading or reciting, they constantly enable sentient beings to attain liberation, peace, and happiness, never doing it for themselves." If we follow that sutra, the current "this is for" text might be "for this" - one should inquire further with Confucian scholars. Regarding "Vajra Roar, etc.," the new translation says: The eastern Vajrapāṇi Bodhisattva Mahāsattva holds a vajra pestle and emits blue light, going with four koṭi bodhisattvas to protect that country. The southern Vajraratna Bodhisattva Mahāsattva holds a vajra maṇi and emits white light, going with four koṭi bodhisattvas to protect that country. The western Vajratīkṣṇa Bodhisattva Mahāsattva holds a vajra sword and emits golden light, going with four koṭi bodhisattvas to protect that country. The northern Vajrayakṣa Bodhisattva Mahāsattva holds a vajra bell and emits lapis lazuli-colored light, going with four koṭi yakṣas to protect that country. The central Vajrapāramitā Bodhisattva Mahāsattva holds a vajra wheel and emits five-colored light, going with four koṭi bodhisattvas to protect that country. Master Ben, according to the Vajraśekhara Sutra, explains: The five bodhisattvas, depending on two kinds of wheels, manifest different bodies. First is the dharma wheel manifesting the true reality body, which is the body attained through the rewards of cultivated vows. Second is the teaching-command wheel showing the wrathful body, manifesting威猛 through arising great compassion. Eastern Vajrapāṇi is Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, manifesting as the Majestic Subduing Three Worlds Vajra. Southern Vajraratna is Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva, manifesting the Wrathful Nectar Army Kuṇḍalī Vajra. Western Vajratīkṣṇa is Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva, manifesting the Wrathful Six-Legged Vajra. Northern Vajrayakṣa is the Destroyer of All Demonic Enemies Bodhisattva, manifesting the Wrathful Pure Body Vajra. Central Vajrapāramitā is the Dharma Wheel Turning Bodhisattva, manifesting the Wrathful Immovable Vajra. Regarding "should establish image forms, etc.," Master Ce says: As explained in the Five Spirit Kings' Causes and Conditions Sutra, in the Thunder Lightning Roar Bodhisattva's causes and conditions, it teaches people to perform sutra reading and copying practices. The ritual method requires making one round mud hut with eight walls installed, with eaves outside the walls adorned according to one's capacity to make it exquisite. Small doors should be opened in the eight corners to allow people to enter and exit. Inside the room, place eight-sided beds, leaving small empty spaces for people to walk. The eight walls inside and outside should be decorated with fragrant mud plaster. On each wall, place a body seat. In front of

【Page 90 Lower】
the two eyes, open two holes to enable seeing the sutra. Directly in front of the two hands, also open two holes to accommodate the two hands for grasping the sutra. When wanting to read sutras, place the sutra outside the wall on a sutra stand. Inside and outside the walls, burn good incense, bathe the body and hands with fragrant water and bean flour, and rinse the mouth. One must carefully observe the wind. If it's an east wind, place the sutra scrolls outside the eastern wall, and read the sutra inside the wall facing east. Let the wind blow the breath, following the wind westward, not perfuming the sutra scrolls. Because the mouth has fragrant breath, this hut is built. The ritual method for copying and reading sutras is as before.

Scripture: "Great King, I now" up to "Prajñāpāramitā"
Master Ye says: Fifth, listing names and encouraging upholding. Master Zang says: This sutra only clarifies fifteen countries, so why say sixteen? Answer: The Great Cloud Sutra has sixteen great countries. Master Ce says: Some sutra versions list fifteen countries, omitting Śārdha country. I say: Examining the sutra lists seventeen countries. Sometimes excluding Mithilā there are sixteen countries. The new version has sixteen.

Scripture: "At that time the great assembly" up to "not be born in that country"
The new translation says: The great assembly of asuras and others heard the Buddha's explanation of various disaster events, their body hair all stood up, and they loudly proclaimed: "May we not be born in that country in the future." I say: Sixth, the great assembly's lamentation. Master Ye says: Third, the assembly's benefit at that time. Text in five parts: First, asura basin. Master Ce agrees. Master Zang says: Benefits are six. First, generally clarifying the great assembly hearing the teaching and arising vows. The first scroll says: There are four benefits. First,

【Page 91 Upper】
great assembly lamentation. I say: Both new and old versions mention the great assembly. Why separately judge it as asura benefit? Therefore Masters Ce and Ye are not yet clear. Also, how does lamentation pertain to the number of benefits? Therefore Master Zang and others are also not acceptable. I think it should be called "external protection and upholding." The text has six parts. Five are as above. Sixth is the great assembly hearing the teaching, lamenting, and making vows. Or it can be called benefits. The text has two parts: first clarifying the great assembly's lamentation, then properly clarifying attaining the path and fruits. Master Zang and others are similar. Question: Masters Ce and Ye say obtaining aversion has no benefit - why now say it's not so? Answer: If one forcefully establishes doctrine, it's difficult to forcefully block it. However, generally speaking...

Scripture: "At that time the sixteen great countries" up to "end of chapter"
The new translation says: At that time the sixteen kings immediately abandoned their royal positions to cultivate the path of renunciation, perfected the eight masteries and ten totalities, and attained patient acceptance, faith acceptance, and acceptance of non-arising dharmas. At that time all human and celestial beings, the great assembly, asuras and others scattered mandārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, vārṣika flowers, and sumanā flowers to make offerings to the Buddha, and according to their nature attained the three liberations, emptiness of persons, emptiness of dharmas, and factors of enlightenment. Countless bodhisattva mahāsattvas scattered kuṇḍa flowers and padma flowers to make offerings to the Buddha, countless samādhis all manifested before them, and they attained dwelling in conforming patience and acceptance of non-arising dharmas. Countless bodhisattva mahāsattvas attained Ganges sand countless samādhi gates, with true and conventional equality and unobstructed understanding, constantly arising great compassion, widely benefiting sentient beings in worlds numerous as dust particles of a million billion asaṃkhyeya buddha lands, manifesting bodies and attaining buddhahood. I say: The second major section on the assembly's benefits has four parts: first, sixteen country kings; second, eighteen Brahmās and asura wheels; third, all other beings; fourth, two classes of bodhisattvas. Regarding observing the four elements and four colors' mastery emergence characteristics,

【Page 91 Lower】
all masters call them the eight masteries. Master Ce says: Earth, water, fire, wind are the four productive elements; blue, yellow, red, white are the four produced colors, called the eight masteries. Because the object-conditions overcome afflictions, they're called masteries. Because they emerge from and leave desire, they're called mastery emergence. Characteristics refer to truth characteristics, or to forms, or to aspects. These are the aspects of the eight masteries' practices and understanding. According to the Mahāprajñāpāramitā, this is somewhat different. It says: first, having internal form-characteristics, observing few external colors; second, having internal form-characteristics, observing many external colors; third, having no internal form-characteristics, observing few external colors; fourth, having no internal form-characteristics, observing many external colors. Blue, yellow, red, white again make four kinds. According to the Necklace Sutra, the eight names are again different. The four elements are the same as this sutra. The four colors are the same as the Prajñāpāramitā Sutra. There are four colors and four others, not explaining blue and others. Master Ye says: The four masteries of having internal colors and others comprehensively observe the four elements. Master Zang's meaning is the same. Regarding "four elements, four colors, not using consciousness-space," all masters call them the ten totalities. Master Ce says: Earth, water, fire, wind, blue, yellow, red, white, space-sphere, consciousness-sphere are called the ten totalities. Also called the ten all-entries. Entry is the sphere. The object-conditions are broad and extensive without gaps, therefore called totality spheres. The aspects are the aspects of the ten all-entries' practices and understanding. Saying "not using" follows the language. Master Ye says: "Not using" refers to the mind that is weary of form. Master Zang says: Four elements and four colors make eight. "Not using" is the sphere of nothingness. Consciousness is the consciousness sphere. Space is the space sphere. These three combined make eleven spheres. I say: Now examining the Great Sutra volume twenty-eight, it lists the ten totalities, excluding fire from the four elements, adding the sphere of nothingness to the four formless realms. Regarding "thirty patience initial ground characteristics, etc.," Master Ce says: The thirty minds before the grounds are called thirty patience. This is the preparatory characteristic of the first ground. The first ground uses the ultimate truth as its essence. The ultimate truth of the first ground and the later nine...

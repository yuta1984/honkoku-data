[The text] does not elaborate. Regarding "non-departing mind," Master Zang says: Because of uninterrupted cultivation. "Through two asaṃkhyeya reaching the dhāra stage." Master Ye says: From "through two" below explains entering the later stage. Pāradhāra means "protection." It means that principle-contemplation gradually deepens and can skillfully protect. Master Zang says: This is called nature seed-nature. The Tripiṭaka Master says: By meaning-translation it is called "protection transcendence." The various practices that are studied can be firmly protected without loss. Master Ce says: If following the Original Record, it is translated as "protection." It means that in the path seed-nature stage, those practices are firm and do not lose their inherent nature. It is called the "protection stage."

Scripture: "Furthermore, path seed-nature" up to "non-retrogression correct stage"
The new translation says: Furthermore, path seed-nature bodhisattvas dwell in firm patience. In the upper volume, the old translation says "firm patience," the new translation says "dedication patience." Now in this section, both new and old say "firm patience." Master Ce says: The third path seed-nature text has three parts. First, indicating the distinct names. Next, from "namely the five appropriations" below, explaining contemplation distinctions. Finally, from "furthermore with" below, the time periods for entering stages. This is the seed-nature of the supramundane noble path, therefore called path seed-nature. Regarding "five appropriations, three realms, two truths, etc.," all masters point to the ten firm minds from the previous Teaching and Transformation chapter. Master Ce says: The five appropriations refer to the contaminated five aggregates appropriated by greed, etc., called the five appropriation aggregates. By contemplating them, one attains the five-division dharma body. Contemplating the three realms, one attains the three emptiness patiences. Contemplating the two truths, one attains the two patiences of impermanence and non-arising. Regarding "yet constantly entering, etc.," Master Ce says: This raises the superior to distinguish from the inferior. It means that although in this stage one practices the ten patiences, among the complete portion one distinguishes from the previous nine patiences and practices the tenth true principle patience contemplation. That is, explaining the non-arising patience contemplation is called first principle truth contemplation. Masters Zang and Ce agree with this. "Karmic habituation reaching conforming path birth therefore."

Master Ce says: By the power of old karma one receives birth in the three realms. Because it becomes the foundation for the noble path, it is called "conforming path birth." "Furthermore through three asaṃkhyeya reaching the non-retrogression correct stage." Master Ye says: From "furthermore through" below explains entering the later stage. "Equal" means simultaneously illuminating the two truths. Masters Zang and Ce mean: realizing principle without retrogression. Master Ye says: non-retrogression of practice.

Scripture: "Furthermore, good awakening" up to "constantly bestowing upon people"
The new translation says: Furthermore, joyful ground bodhisattva mahāsattvas transcend the foolish beings' ground, are born into the Tathāgata's family, dwell in equal patience, and with initial signless wisdom illuminate the supreme truth. Master Ce says: The fourth good awakening text has five parts. First, indicating the distinct names of stages. Second, from "dwelling in equality" below, explaining cultivation distinctions. Third, from "through four" below, the time periods for entering the treasury. Fourth, from "without three realms" below, clarifying birth distinctions. Fifth, from "constantly cultivating" below, the extent of ascending stages. Master Ye says: Simultaneously illuminating without partiality is called good awakening. From "dwelling in equal patience" to "non-departing mind" - Master Ce says: The text explaining cultivation distinctions has two parts. First revealing the distinct characteristics of the two wisdoms. Later, from "thus, good sons" below, again revealing the similarities and differences of the two wisdoms. In the former there are two parts. First establishing two chapters. Later, from "entering signless giving" below, separately explaining the two chapters. This is the first part. "Equal patience" means clarifying true wisdom - separating from existence and non-existence is called "equality." "Four attractions" means establishing skillful means wisdom. "Extinguishing the three realms reaching signlessness therefore." Master Ce says: This explains true wisdom. Cultivating the three-wheel giving, having no greedy nature, therefore extinguishing the greed of the three realms. Master Ye says: Entering the signless giving pāramitā contemplation. Regarding "in the first principle, etc.," Master Ce says: This explains true wisdom, realizing the three unconditioned. First is dharma-nature unconditioned. Next is cessation through selection unconditioned. Finally is cessation not through selection unconditioned. The first

【Page 81 Upper】
has two names. First is dharma-nature. Second is space. Cessation through selection has three names. First is cessation through selection. Second is cessation through counting conditions. Third is cessation through wisdom conditions. Cessation not through selection [can be understood similarly]. Master Ye says: Dharma-nature unconditioned replaces the Hīnayāna's space. If following Master Zang's intention, from "in the first principle" to "signless unconditioned" - this is cessation through counting conditions unconditioned. That is, this also establishes two unconditioned. Regarding "no self-other characteristics, signless, no signlessness," Master Ce says: "No self-other characteristics" means eliminating self-characteristics, immediately revealing person-emptiness. "Signless" means revealing phenomena-emptiness. Because principle is not signless, it says "no signlessness." Because it is not with characteristics, it says "signless." Master Zang says: Because of self there is other; self being absent, other is also absent. One "no" eliminates self, one "no" eliminates other. Two "nos" eliminate both, therefore called "no signlessness." Master Ye says: This generally explains the above three unconditioned. It means because there is no self and other, there are no existing characteristics. Because there is no "no," signlessness is also absent. "Immeasurable skillful means all present" - Master Ce says: This indicates skillful means wisdom. Master Ye says: "Present" means direct, "skillful" uses expedient. From "contemplating true characteristics skillfully" to "purifying Buddha lands." Master Ce says: This explains six types of skillful means. Regarding "not sinking, etc." - ordinary beings sink in saṃsāra, the Two Vehicles exit saṃsāra. Dwelling practices can be changed, the ten dedications still have inversions. The first ground separates from four. One explanation says: Sinking means torpor. Exiting means restlessness. Changing means doubt, etc. Inversions are self-view, etc. Examining Master Ye's intention: Contemplating emptiness without leaving the conventional, therefore not sinking. Contemplating conventional without leaving emptiness, therefore not exiting. Not abandoning existence to become empty, therefore not changing. Not abandoning emptiness to adapt to conditions, therefore not inverted. Regarding "not dwelling in results, etc.," Master Ce says: Not being the same as the Two Vehicles seeking to dwell in small results is called "not dwelling in results." Not being the same as ordinary

【Page 81 Lower】
beings having no seeking to dwell in results is called "not non-dwelling." Seeking to advance toward bodhi is called "heading toward sarvajñā." Regarding "practicing the Buddha path through non-paths," Master Ce says: The Vimalakīrti [Sutra] says: Manifesting as a courtesan to attract those attached to beauty. First using the hook of desire to draw them into the Buddha path. Regarding "One Vehicle skillful means," Master Zang says: Only practicing the One Great Vehicle non-dual dharma gate to transform sentient beings. Regarding "transformation skillful means," Master Ce says: Transformation is an alternative name for change. Regarding "being born in pure Buddha lands," Master Zang says: Also being born in impure lands, but not explained due to brevity. Regarding "initial awakening wisdom," Master Ce says: Because it is initial wisdom, it says "initial." Regarding "awakening wisdom not realizing, not sinking, not sinking, not reaching," Master Ye says: Because it does not cease and extinguish, it does not realize. Because it does not abandon existence, it does not sink. Because it does not attach to characteristics, it does not exit. Because it does not abandon or grasp that, it does not invert. Master Ce's one interpretation says: Perhaps "not reaching" is an error. It should say "not inverted." Regarding "without three realms, etc.," Master Ye says: Before the grounds it is karmic birth. From the first ground onward it is vow birth. Because one completes the results of afflictions and karma, one no longer creates new [karma], but only through great compassion and transformation is born in pure lands. The first volume says: This clarifies that sages do not create new karma but only through vow power support old karma to receive pure land birth. Master Ce says: Western masters themselves have two explanations. One says: Ground-level bodhisattvas all receive transformation [body]. Therefore receiving the ten kingships are all transformation bodies. One says: There is a master named "Subduing Light" who, depending on the Saṃdhinirmocana [Sutra], makes such explanations. From the eighth ground and above, the royal bodies manifested are only transformations. From the seventh ground and before, they still generate afflictions to nourish three-realm karma and receive divided-segment bodies. Regarding "through vow power, etc.," Master Ce says: Through vow power they are born in pure lands. One interpretation explains from the majority perspective. If afflictions nourish karma to be born in the three realms, like Subdu-

quality, third is action, fourth is great existence, fifth is similarity and difference, sixth is combination. They explain great existence and call it the Great Existence Sutra." Master Dōeki agrees with this. "One who has severed and exhausted the afflictions and retributions of the three realms is called Buddha" (the new translation says: "One who has merely severed and exhausted the ignorance of the three realms is immediately called Buddha"). "Self-nature purity is called awakening sarvajña-nature" (the new translation says: "Self-nature purity, awakening-nature is precisely all Buddhas' omniscience"). Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "If following the basic record, severing the three realms means removing the six consciousnesses, called karmic purity. Severing afflictions means removing the ādāna, which is the seventh consciousness, explaining affliction purity. Exhausting retribution means removing the ālaya, which is the eighth consciousness, explaining fruit purity. Such three purities are called Buddha's self-nature purity, sarvajña-nature. This meaning explains that all sentient beings with these three purities are immediately called Buddhas. From this one should know that even obtaining Buddha-fruit does not transcend the three realms." I say: "Not transcending the three realms, etc. - supporting the basic record's meaning: All sentient beings from beginningless time naturally dwell originally in the three realms, complete with defiled and pure natures. If afflictions are exhausted, they are called Buddhas; if afflictions are not yet severed, they are called sentient beings. Therefore living beings and Buddhas fundamentally do not transcend the three realms. If someone calculates that sentient beings perhaps originally exist outside the realms, this is heterodox teaching, not Buddha's teaching." I say this interpretation excellently grasps the sutra's meaning. The reason is that previously mentioning the Great Existence Sutra, etc. destroys the heterodox. Later mentioning severing the three realms, etc. reveals the orthodox. The meaning of revealing orthodoxy is that originally dwelling in the three realms means not transcending. Now examining the Awakening of Faith treatise, it says: "If one explains that outside the three realms there are additionally sentient beings who begin arising, this is precisely heterodox sutra teaching." Master Wŏnhyo's commentary says: "As explained in the Benevolent Kings Sutra." The sutra text is unclear and scholars are confused by the text. How fortunate that I now open the wisdom eye! This treatise passage is a bright jewel in the topknot. "This is sentient beings' fundamental karma" (the new translation says: "Through this they obtain becoming the foundation of sentient beings, and are also the fundamental practice of all Buddhas and bodhisattvas"). Master Dōeki says:

[Page 38, Lower]
"Fundamental karma means Buddha-nature principle." I say: "Master Dōeki attributes this passage to what came above; Masters Jizang and Wŏnch'ŭk attribute this to the concluding passage below. Now examining the sutra's meaning, self-nature pure original awakening principle-nature serves as the foundation of all living beings and Buddhas. Therefore following Master Dōeki's quotation."

Sutra: "This is the complete fourteen patience [stages] within the five patience [levels] that all Buddhas and bodhisattvas fundamentally practiced"
New translation: "This becomes what bodhisattvas fundamentally practiced - the fourteen patience [stages] within the five patience methods."

Sutra: "They addressed Buddha saying: How do bodhisattvas, through fundamental karma purity, transform sentient beings... up to ruling as kings of the three realms, transforming all sentient beings?"

Master Dōeki says: "Below this is the second answer to the second question 'How do they practice transforming sentient beings for others' benefit?' The text has two parts: first question, then answer. 'They addressed Buddha saying: How... transform sentient beings?'" (The new translation says: "Buddha said: Great King, you previously asked: How do bodhisattvas transform sentient beings? Bodhisattva mahāsattvas transform thus.") Master Dōeki says: "This is the initial question. Speaking of 'fundamental karma purity' means original awakening true-nature embodies myriad virtues completely and possesses unconditioned compassion. Sentient beings originally possess [this] but are poisoned by delusion and lose that compassionate function. When delusion is purified, compassion remains and marvelous function arises. Therefore it speaks of transforming sentient beings through fundamental karma. Like a person having illness and losing their skillful functions - when disease ends and the body is complete, power and function are constant." Master Jizang says: "Bodhisattvas, through compassion and wisdom in the two places of birth-death and nirvana, having no defilement is called fundamental karma purity." Speaking of "Buddha said: From initial first ground... up to ruling and transforming all sentient beings" - Master Dōeki says: "First is brief answer; second, from 'fundamental karma' below is extensive answer. From initial first ground up to later 'all self-practiced places, all knowing and seeing.'" Master Jizang says: "Unconditioned illumination - cause and effect both hidden, therefore called 'all knowing and seeing.'" Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Self-practiced places means the realms of self-practice within the ten grounds. Second is Buddha-practiced places, meaning the realm of practice of the marvelous awakening ground. The previous ten grounds only practice self-practiced places. The later diamond single-thought universally practices both places. Therefore the sutra below says 'same as Buddha's practice-places, like Buddha's realm.'" From fundamental karma... up to ruling and transforming all sentient beings in a hundred Buddha-lands - Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "The basic record says there are three [types of] lands: first is Dharma-teaching land - with billions of suns and moons, transforms the small vehicle; second is spiritual power land - with billions upon billions of suns and moons, transforms the middle vehicle; third is wisdom land - with immeasurable worlds, transforms bodhisattvas. Now speaking of 'hundred Buddha-lands' means Dharma-teaching land." "Acting as Jambudvīpa's four heavenly kings" (the new translation says: "Acting as Jambudvīpa's wheel-turning sage king, cultivating the hundred dharma wisdom-gates, through dāna-pāramitā dwelling in equanimous mind, transforming all sentient beings of the four continents") - Master Bian says: "Like the Ten Grounds Sutra, the first ground acts as Jambudvīpa king. The Necklace Sutra explains that from first ground up are crystal wheel-kings. The Flower Garland Sutra says the first ground acts as Jambudvīpa king. Here saying 'wheel-king' and mentioning 'Jambudvīpa' clarifies the sutra's dwelling place. Also saying: How does this sutra's first ground bodhisattva differ from the path-seed-nature wheel? The answer is as the verse below says: 'Provisionally transforming sentient beings, traveling through a hundred lands' - this hundred [compared to] that one. Holy and ordinary, superior and inferior have many differences." Master Jizang says: "Acting as the four types of wheel-kings among humans and the four heavenly kings. According to the Ten Grounds Sutra, the first ground acts as iron wheel-king. The Necklace Sutra says cultivating the ten faiths for one kalpa, two kalpas, cultivating the ten faith-goodness has three grades: superior grade is iron wheel-king transforming one continent; middle grade is scattered-grain kings; inferior grade is kings among humans. Ten abodes are copper wheel-kings, ten practices are silver wheel-kings, ten dedications are diamond kings, first ground are hundred-land necklace seven-treasure-characteristic wheel four heavenly kings. If so, the ten abodes already surpass the first ground. How can one use a single sutra to insist on a definitive interpretation?" Many masters say: "First ground acts as

[Page 39, Upper] 
the four heavenly kings. Now saying 'Jambudvīpa' means acting as Southern Growth Heavenly King." (I say: New and old sutras are unclear. The masters' views are also thus. One should invest the labor.) The hundred dharma-gates - Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Within the ten faiths, each one completely practices the ten faiths. Therefore called hundred dharma-gates" (I say: the Necklace Sutra's explanation). The thousand dharma-gates - Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Means the ten faith-minds each increasingly cultivating one hundred minds. Therefore called thousand dharma-gates." Trāyastriṃśa heaven - Master Dōeki says: "This is called thirty-three." Yāma heaven - Master Dōeki says: "The Great Treatise says Suyāma, this is called wonderful-good." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "This is called time-division." Some say: "Yama, this is called time-division." "Ten myriad Buddha-lands, etc." (the new translation says "myriad") - the first fascicle says: "First ground hundred, second ground thousand, third ground by example should use myriad as the number. Obtaining faith-patience completeness, adding nine times." Tuṣita heaven - Master Dōeki says: "The Great Treatise says this is called wonderful-satisfaction." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "This is called joy-satisfaction." Some say: "Also called contentment." The eight truths are: conditioned four truths, unconditioned four truths. Also saying: "Impermanence, suffering, emptiness, no-self, permanence, bliss, self, purity." Master Dōeki says: "Arising-ceasing four truths, no-arising four truths." I say: "These interpretations seem like conceptual inference. Also, both masters present equivalent eight truths, yet they are not clear. Therefore I don't quote them. Master Wŏnch'ŭk's clear interpretation, therefore I decisively present it." Master Wŏnch'ŭk presents different explanations and concludes saying: "Now following the Ten Grounds, using the latter eight types of truths among fourteen truths to interpret this passage. The previous six truths are precisely the two truths in this sutra. Speaking of eight truths: The Ten Grounds Sutra says: 'Awakening to dharmas' self-characteristics and common characteristics, therefore excellently knowing characteristic-truths. Awakening to dharmas' distinctions, therefore excellently knowing distinction-truths. Awakening to discriminating aggregates, realms, and sense-bases, therefore excellently knowing explanation-accomplishment truths. Awakening to body-mind suffering and affliction, therefore excellently knowing matter-truths. Awakening to all paths' arising and continuation, therefore excellently knowing arising-truths. Ultimately extinguishing all afflictive forces, therefore excellently knowing exhaustion and no-arising wisdom-truths. Generating non-dual practice, therefore excellently knowing causing entry into the path

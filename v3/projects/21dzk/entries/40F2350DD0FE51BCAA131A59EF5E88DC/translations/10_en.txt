are led astray. Regarding "if using names to name," etc., recognizing that dharmas are merely names becomes understanding. This is also without fault. Below "non-abiding" (these four characters are suspected to be superfluous or copying errors). Now, following the new version: from "due to conventional truth" to "views also called seeing" represents the meaning of conventional truth and three provisional designations. Regarding "the nature of beings is real," as the Prajñāpāramitā Treatise says: real due to the mundane siddhānta, up to real due to the ultimate siddhānta. That the sixty-two views are conventional truth is as stated in the text below: "Whether existing or non-existing, merely generating sentient beings' recollection is called conventional truth." Having no substance and following emotions as provisional, this would be included in name-provisional designation. The meaning of the present text is: from above starting with "various object-realms" down to "what outsiders calculate" - if provisionally discussing provisional characteristics, they are not non-existent; if definitively clinging to real nature, they are not existent. Regarding "if using names to name," etc.: if one clings to name-characteristics, one does not see true nature. "Non-non-seeing" means "not non-attachment views." Also: the sixty-two views briefly indicate wrong views; from "Great King, if..." onward extensively clarifies this. Seven sages are as before; regarding eight saints, Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: the four directions and four fruits. I say: the sūtra text from "all beings" onward has correct views and wrong views intermixed, making discrimination difficult. Scholars should think carefully.

Sūtra: Addressing the Buddha: Prajñā... explained within.

The second is contemplative prajñā. First questioning, then answering.

Sūtra: Addressing the Buddha: Prajñāpāramitā has dharmas, non-non-dharmas, Mahāyāna - how does it illuminate?

The new version says: "The true nature of all dharmas is pure and equal, neither existing nor non-existing - how does wisdom illuminate?" I say: from "Addressing the Buddha" to "how does it illuminate" is the question. Master Dōeki says: "having dharmas, non-non-dharmas" means there are no dharmas that are not empty. True characteristic is without characteristic - what is there to illuminate? Is this called Mahāyāna contemplation? I add: now following the new version.

[Page 20, Lower]
In the new version, "having dharmas" refers to all dharmas, and "non-non-dharmas" refers to neither existing nor non-existing. Masters Jizang, Wŏnch'ŭk and others have the same understanding. The question's meaning is: depending on prajñā principle, the true nature of all dharmas is neither existing nor non-existing, completely unattainable. Wanting to know the wisdom of Mahāyāna contemplation - how does it illuminate? The first fascicle's meaning is similar.

Sūtra: Great King, Mahāyāna sees non-non-dharmas. If dharmas are non-non-dharmas, this is called non-non-dharma emptiness. Dharma-nature emptiness, form-sensation-perception-mental formations-consciousness emptiness, twelve bases emptiness, eighteen realms emptiness, six great dharmas emptiness, four truths emptiness, twelve conditions emptiness - these dharmas are immediately arising, immediately abiding, immediately ceasing, immediately existing, immediately empty. Explained within.

Master Dōeki says: The Buddha's answer has five parts. First, briefly answering the two illuminated objects; from "dharma-nature emptiness" onward extensively clarifying object-emptiness. I say: following the new version, extensively explaining the meaning of non-non-dharma emptiness. Master Wŏnch'ŭk agrees. Third, from "prajñā" onward jointly discriminating objects and wisdom; fourth, from "good son, if bodhisattvas" onward distinguishing wrong and correct; fifth, from "this is" onward concluding different names. I say: should it be called discriminating different names from "immediately capable of carrying" onward? Masters Wŏnch'ŭk and the first fascicle's meaning are similar.

Sūtra: Great King, Mahāyāna sees non-non-dharmas. If dharmas are non-non-dharmas, this is called non-non-dharma emptiness.

The new version says: "Wisdom illuminates true nature as neither existing nor non-existing." Master Dōeki says: briefly answering what is illuminated. Regarding "if dharmas," etc., the first fascicle says: "Now clarifying that what is seen is only emptiness. What does emptiness illuminate? Using non-illumination to illuminate." Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: referring to conditioned dharmas. "If non-non-dharmas" means among all dharmas it is called "non-non-dharma emptiness." Master Dōeki says: dharmas are originally without dharmas, hence called "non-non." If dharmas are non-non, provisionally called "empty dharmas." How could one hear emptiness and generate clinging? Master Jizang says: "non-non-dharmas" means neither existing nor non-existing. If dharmas exist, they can be known as existing; if dharmas are non-existent, they can be illuminated as non-existent. Because dharmas are neither existing nor non-existing, illumination is like

[Page 21, Upper]
empty space. I say: the meaning of the sūtra's character "if" is not yet clear. Now I consider "if" to be like "if this," as seen in Analects commentaries. The meaning is: Mahāyāna sees non-non-dharmas. If dharmas are such non-non-dharmas, this is called non-non-dharma emptiness.

Sūtra: Dharma-nature emptiness... all dharmas are likewise.

The new version says: "Wisdom illuminates true nature as neither existing nor non-existing. Why is this? Because dharma-nature is empty. This is precisely form-sensation-perception-mental formations-consciousness, twelve bases, eighteen realms, seven greats, six realms, twelve conditions, two truths, four truths - all are empty. These various dharmas are immediately arising, immediately ceasing, immediately existing, immediately empty, moment by moment, likewise. Why? In one thought there are ninety moments. One moment experiences nine hundred arisings and ceasings. All conditioned dharmas are completely empty." Master Dōeki says: extensively clarifying object-emptiness. The text has three parts: first, "dharma-nature emptiness" indicates nature-emptiness; second, from "form-sensation" onward lists empty dharmas; third, from "these dharmas" onward explains the reason for emptiness. Understanding this delusory discriminative nature is immediately naturelessness, called nature-emptiness. The first fascicle says: "The first sentence generally clarifies that dharma-nature is all empty; afterward exemplifying the six categories." I say: using "dharma-nature emptiness" as the general heading sentence well accords with the new version and also accords with the text below "these dharmas immediately arising," etc. One cannot say dharma-nature is arising-ceasing dharmas. Therefore scholars should think carefully. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: non-non-dharma emptiness, going through dharma distinctions, forms seven emptinesses. First, dharma-nature emptiness - all true natures are originally naturally empty, not due to wisdom power, called dharma-nature emptiness. Second, five aggregates; third, twelve bases; fourth, eighteen realms; fifth, six greats referring to four elements, space, and consciousness; sixth, four truths; seventh, twelve conditions. I say: following this interpretation, the text "these dharmas immediately arising" can be harmonized. "These dharmas immediately arising" up to "form, all dharmas also

[Page 21, Lower]
likewise" - Master Dōeki says: explaining the reason for emptiness. The text has three parts: first, indicating that the previous aggregates-realms-bases are conditioned dharmas; second, "why?" etc. is questioning explanation; third, "up to form" etc. analogously refutes all dharmas. Form etc. arise and cease according to conditions, immediately non-existent. If conditioned dharmas have no nature, how could there be unconditioned? If aggregates and realms are thus, truths and conditions are naturally eliminated. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: from "these dharmas" onward explains emptiness in terms of consciousness; from "up to" onward analogously explains the four aggregates and all dharmas. Master Jizang says: "these dharmas immediately arising" recapitulates the above form and other dharmas. From "moments likewise" onward discriminates emptiness in terms of mind. From "why?" onward explains the reason why the above form-mind are empty. "Ninety moments make one thought" up to "all dharmas are likewise" - above extensively discriminated form and briefly discriminated mind. Now also in terms of inner extensively clarifying mind and briefly explaining form-emptiness. The sage's skillful means alternately presents extensive and brief explanations. "Up to all dharmas likewise" concludes the above mind-dharmas. I say: regarding this passage of sūtra text, various masters' explanations are unclear. Now investigating: this uses conditioned impermanence to reveal the meaning of emptiness. "These dharmas immediately arising" etc. clarifies one-period impermanence. "Moments" etc. clarifies momentary impermanence. "Up to form, all dharmas" etc. uses the above-listed dharmas as examples to reveal various other dharmas. However, the word "form" is unclear. Master Jizang does not recapitulate this character - perhaps a different version? What various masters recapitulate often has this character. I sincerely attempt one interpretation. If following the Mahāprajñāpāramitā meaning, it should fully state: "Because dharma-nature is empty, form-sensation-perception-mental formations-consciousness are empty, up to because form is empty, sensation-perception-mental formations-consciousness are empty, etc." Going through all dharmas should be explained thus. Now briefly clarifying it, so speaking thus? Question: As listed above, form comes after dharma-nature. Now briefly

This is the inherent nature when one has not yet attained Buddhahood. When one has already attained Buddhahood, it is called sarvajñā. This is because it is the essence of wisdom. From "the prajñā of the three vehicles" to "enlightened nature" repeatedly explains the previous meaning of "what is not yet attained serves as nature." Generally, the inherent nature of prajñā in the three vehicles originally exists. Through this enlightened nature, each attains the fruit of enlightenment. If one discusses the wisdom mother broadly, the two vehicles also have their share. From "if bodhisattvas" to "pāramitā" clarifies this method of cultivation. "Non-grasping" destroys the grasping subject. "No letters" destroys the grasped object. This is cultivating the wisdom mother by transcending subject-object grasping regarding letters. "Apart from letters, not non-letters" means that although one transcends subject-object grasping, one does not depart from letters. The nature of letters is transcendent—this is liberation, not the same as the heterodox views of outsiders or the partial emptiness of the two vehicles.

Scripture: "Great King, if bodhisattvas..." up to "like this"
The new version says: "Great King, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas protect Buddha-fruit, protect the practice of the ten stages, and transform sentient beings like this."

Scripture: "Addressed the Buddha saying 'immeasurable categories'" up to "non-dual dharma gate"
This questions and answers the meaning of dharma gates being one, two, etc. Regarding "immeasurable categories, etc." (The new version says: "True nature is one. The categories of sentient beings, their spiritual roots and practices are immeasurable. Are dharma gates one or immeasurable?") Master Ce says: "Sharp and dull faculties." Master Ye says: "The spiritual natures of the three vehicles." Regarding practices, Master Ce says "greed, pride, etc." Master Ye says "six perfections and myriad practices." Regarding "dharma gates being one, etc.," Master Ce says: "Are the various dharma contemplation gates explained for them one or immeasurable?" Master Ye says: "Dharma gates are one in accordance with principle, immeasurable in response to faculties. Principle cannot be different; faculties cannot be uniform. How does one operate the non-different principle to reach the non-uniform faculties?" Regarding "all dharma contemplation gates, etc." (The new version says: "Dharma gates are neither one nor immeasurable. Why? Due to sentient beings' form dharmas, mind dharmas, five grasping aggregate characteristics, self-person wisdom views, various spiritual roots and practices, boundless categories. Dharma gates following roots also have immeasurability. These dharma natures are neither characteristics nor non-characteristics, yet not immeasurable") Regarding "also not having characteristics, etc.," Master Zang says: "Some say four sentences should be made: neither having characteristics, neither non-characteristics, neither non-having characteristics, neither non-non-characteristics. For the sake of brevity, only the first and last are mentioned. According to present understanding, there are three sentences above. First, 'not having characteristics'—if so, there should be non-characteristics. Therefore it says 'not non-characteristics.' If so, it should be 'not non-non-characteristics.' Therefore it says 'not non-non-characteristics.' Now mentioning first and last to indicate the middle accordingly. Therefore only two sentences."

"One-two is ultimate truth" (The new version says: "Understanding one-two as neither one nor two is precisely ultimate truth meaning") Master Ce says: "Contemplating one-two is conventional truth. Not seeing one-two is ultimate truth. Now clarifying that conventional is precisely ultimate, therefore saying 'one-two is ultimate truth.'" Master Ye says: "The true nature of one-two is precisely ultimate meaning." "Existence or non-existence is worldly truth" (The new version says: "Grasping attachment to one-two as existing or non-existing is precisely conventional truth. Master Ben says: 'Clinging to the conventional as definitely existing and ultimate meaning as truly non-existent—these are all deluded emotions of conventional truth'")

Regarding "emptiness truth, form truth, mind truth, etc." (This text is not in the new version) Master Ye says: "Some say emptiness truth is ultimate truth. Form truth and mind truth are conventional truth. Also below there are three truths: first conventional truth, second ultimate truth, third ultimate meaning truth. In the verse text above, having the third truth illuminating both truths simultaneously is this. If following this meaning, then emptiness truth is ultimate, form truth is conventional, mind—namely mind-suchness—serves as ultimate meaning truth." (I privately say: The latter explanation is superior. Now using this explanation to help clarify the scriptural meaning: Above, regarding the two truths, it clarifies the meaning of one-two. Now in this passage, it comprehensively discusses the three truths. All dharmas are one because of emptiness, immeasurable because of the provisional, neither one nor immeasurable because of the middle, not rejecting immeasurability nor obstructing oneness)

Regarding "self, person, knowledge views, five aggregates emptiness, all dharmas emptiness, etc." I privately say: The meaning of this passage's context is unclear in the scripture, and various explanations are also thus. Now I think as quoted above (The new version says: "Sentient beings' form dharmas, mind dharmas, five grasping aggregate characteristics, self-person knowledge views, various spiritual roots and practices, boundless categories, etc."). That text corresponds to this text in the old scripture. Therefore what is called "self, person, etc." reveals the categorical differences of various sentient beings. The meaning is: Like this, sentient beings are empty yet not the same, therefore dharma gates are neither one nor two. Observers should think carefully.

Scripture: "Great King, the seven Buddhas..." up to "attained Buddhahood not long ago"
Praising the scripture and encouraging its maintenance. Regarding the seven Buddhas, Master Zang says: "Including Śākyamuni makes seven Buddhas, clarifying that what he teaches is the same as the six Buddhas." Master Ce has two explanations: "First says: Adding one more Buddha before Vipaśyin, the seventh being Kāśyapa. Another explanation: The seventh is Śākyamuni. Following the majority it speaks of 'past.' According to reality, one Buddha is precisely the present."

Regarding "You great assembly, receive, maintain, recite, liberation" (The new version says: "You great assembly, receive and maintain, recite, practice as taught. This is receiving and maintaining the Buddhas' dharma") "This scripture's merit, five practices" up to "inexhaustible" (The new version says: "Great King, this prajñāpāramitā's merit is limitless. If there were Ganges sand number of ineffable Buddhas, each Buddha teaching immeasurable ineffable sentient beings, each sentient being attaining Buddhahood, these Buddhas again teaching immeasurable ineffable sentient beings who all attain Buddhahood, the prajñāpāramitā spoken by these Buddhas having immeasurable ineffable nayuta billions of verses that cannot be fully explained. Among all verses taking one verse and dividing it into a thousand parts, again among ten parts explaining one part—the merit of sentence meanings is still endless. How much more the merit of such immeasurable sentence meanings. Etc.")

Regarding "how much more in this" up to "not long ago" (The new version says: "If someone can generate one moment of pure faith in this scripture, this person immediately transcends hundreds of kalpas, thousands of kalpas, hundreds of thousands of millions of kalpas of birth-death suffering. How much more copying, receiving, maintaining, reciting. Etc.") Master Zang says: "One moment of faith transcending the ten stages means: One moment of no-attainment prajñā faith surpasses the merit of cultivating the ten stages with attainment for hundreds of thousands of kalpas." (I privately say: The meaning of the text "how much more" at the beginning and "transcending ten stages" etc. is unclear. Students should think well. The new version is clear)

Scripture: "At that time the great assembly..." up to "ten stage nature" (The new version says: "Ten billion people attained three emptiness patience, one hundred million people attained great emptiness patience, immeasurable bodhisattvas attained dwelling in the ten stages")
The assembly's benefits received. Master Zang says: "Three emptiness patience means emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness. Speaking of 'great emptiness patience' means the fundamental wisdom within the ten stages. Realizing suchness is called 'great emptiness patience.' Also called 'no-attainment emptiness.' Speaking of 'ten stage nature' means being above the first stage." Masters Ce and Ye's explanations of three emptinesses differ and won't be extensively quoted. Great emptiness is similarly called "ten stages." (I privately say: Why again discuss the ten stages' merit?)

Scripture: "Great King, this scripture..." up to "end of chapter" (The new version doesn't have this text at the end of this chapter. It's at the end of the entrustment chapter in the lower fascicle. There it says: "The Buddha told the great king: This scripture is called the Benevolent King Prajñāpāramitā for Protecting the Nation. It can also be called Sweet Dew Dharma Medicine. If there is practice and service, it can cure all illnesses. Great King, the merit of prajñāpāramitā is like empty space, immeasurable. If there are those who receive, maintain, and recite it, the merit obtained can protect benevolent kings and all sentient beings like walls and ramparts. Therefore you should receive and maintain it.")
Praising the name. Master Ce says: "There are four alternative names: first protecting the nation, second dharma medicine, third protecting dwellings, fourth protecting the body."

Benevolent King Prajñāpāramitā Scripture for Protecting the Nation, Protecting the Nation Chapter Five

Master Ye says: "This chapter second clarifies external protective practices." Some explain this chapter's name as having four distinctions: first clarifying the intention to protect, second clarifying the mind that protects, third clarifying protecting the dharma, fourth clarifying what can protect. First, the intention to protect: "The Vimalakīrti Sūtra says: 'When sentient beings are ill, bodhisattvas are ill. When sentient beings' illness is cured, bodhisattvas are also cured,' up to seeing sentient beings' suffering and rescuing them. How could the mind not be like rescuing a burning head? Avalokiteśvara dwelling in the sahā world, Kṣitigarbha constantly residing in the uninterrupted hell—how could one not think deeply about this?" Second, clarifying the protecting mind: "If one wishes to protect things, first protect one's own mind and should dwell in compassion." Third, clarifying protecting the dharma: "Prajñāpāramitā is the mother of all Buddhas. All sages and saints depend on prajñā power. It can exhaust the ocean of afflictions and spread clouds of great compassion. Avalokiteśvara's merit of responding to mindfulness, Kṣitigarbha's power of protecting nations, Śākyamuni dividing his body throughout the dharma realm, Vimalakīrti incorporating the ocean in a hair tip—all due to internally realizing prajñā, therefore spiritual power is thus." Fourth, clarifying what can protect: "This chapter has one hundred divisions of spirits and ghosts, the receiving and maintaining chapter has five great bodhisattvas and five thousand retinues. The Contemplating Buddha Samādhi Ocean Sūtra says those who recite prajñā have all Buddhas personally come to protect them."

Master Ce says: "According to the original record, there are two kinds of nations: first worldly two-vehicle ordinary beings, second transcendent from ten faiths to ten stages. There are two kinds of bandits: first external robbers, thieves, birds and beasts etc., second internal so-called afflictions. There are two kinds of protection: first external namely one hundred divisions and spirits, second internal so-called wisdom. Whether internal or

Distinguishing. Later encouraging maintenance. In the preceding text there are three parts. First, clarifying two truths, two and non-dual. Second, clarifying teaching dharma and not teaching. Third, clarifying dharma gates, two and non-dual. Master Zang's meaning says: There are three question-answers distinguishing two truths and non-dual. First, properly distinguishing two truths and non-dual. Second, clarifying teaching dharma and non-dual. Third, distinguishing dharma gates and non-dual. The third question-answer text has three parts. First, properly questioning and answering dharma gates and non-dual. "Great King, seven Buddhas explained" below is the second praising the teaching, encouraging cultivation and clarifying the scripture's merits. Third, "Great King, this scripture" below. Third, determining the scripture's name and encouraging reception and maintenance. I privately say: First divide into six parts. First, question-answer distinguishing the meaning of three prajñās. Second, "Great King, if bodhisattvas" below, generally concluding the protection of fruits and causes clarified from the Contemplating Emptiness chapter onward. Third, "addressed the Buddha saying 'immeasurable'" below, questioning and answering the meaning of dharma gates being one, two, etc. Fourth, "Great King, seven Buddhas" below, praising the scripture and encouraging maintenance. Fifth, "at that time the great assembly" below, the assembly at that time obtaining benefits. Sixth, "Great King, this scripture" below, praising the name and encouraging maintenance. The new [version] (possibly missing the character "scripture" below "new") places the sixth text at the end of the Entrusting chapter. Therefore Liangben divides the new version's text of this chapter saying: First, question-answer distinguishing. Second, clarifying that Buddhas speak in unison. Third, hearing dharma and obtaining benefits.

Scripture: "At that time, Prasenajit..." up to "true nature prajñāpāramitā"

I privately say: First, question-answer distinguishing the meaning of three prajñās, which becomes three parts. First, prose and verse clarifying substantial-characteristic prajñā. Next, "Great King, bodhisattvas" below clarifies contemplative prajñā. "Again addressed the Buddha saying 'how'" below clarifies textual prajñā. When various masters previously explained the Contemplating Emptiness chapter, they used the three prajñās to analyze the scripture text completely. This meaning is extremely good, so now I follow that precedent.

Scripture: "At that time, Prasenajit..." up to "end of verse"

I privately say: Clarifying substantial-characteristic prajñā. First question, then answer.

Scripture: "At that time, Prasenajit..." up to "what is this matter?"

Question

Scripture: "The Buddha told the Great King..." up to "end of verse" (The new version says: "The Buddha said: Great King, you already asked about this meaning in the dharma of Dragon Light King Buddha in the past. I now have no teaching, you now have no listening, no teaching. No listening—this is called one meaning, two meanings. You now listen carefully—I shall explain for you. At that time the World-Honored One spoke a verse saying: [etc.]")

Master Ce says: The answer has two parts. First, brief answer. Later, "seven Buddhas" below is extensive explanation. Master Ye says: First, brief answer. Second, "seven Buddhas" below cites evidence to answer. Third, "Great King, bodhisattvas" below explains the answer. Master Zang's meaning is similar. (I cite the scripture text, so I don't follow the various masters' commentaries. Readers should think well)

Scripture: "The Buddha told the Great King..." up to "practice according to dharma"

Regarding "no listening, no teaching": Masters Zang and Ye say: No listening, no teaching is one meaning, while having listening and teaching is two meanings. Master Ben says: As stated in the Original Record: Having teaching and having listening is not-one. No teaching and no listening is not-two. Not-one and not-two is the ultimate truth. Ancient explanations of this text have two interpretations. First: Not-one is the two truths—one is ultimate, two is conventional. Not-two is ultimate truth. Because it is neither ultimate nor conventional, it is called ultimate truth. Second: Not-one is the meaning of two truths being different. Not-two is the meaning of two truths being non-different. There is no third truth outside the two truths. Now I further explain: Seeing that teaching and listening exist is conventional, therefore not-one. Having no characteristics of teaching and listening is ultimate, therefore not-two. Through characteristics and no-characteristics, one clarifies oneness and twoness. (I privately say: This meaning is extremely profound. One should explain this text using Tiantai's meanings of two truths, three truths, one truth, no truths, etc. Scholars should think skillfully)

Scripture: "Seven Buddhas' verses..." up to "end of verse"

Master Ce says: The second extensive explanation has two parts. First, citing the seven Buddhas' verses. Later, prose explaining the present Buddha's teaching. There are eight and a half verses. First, there are three verses properly explaining the two truths. Next, there are three verses explaining the meaning of oneness and difference, properly explaining the king's difficulty. The latter two and a half verses distinguish conventional truth and conclude the above meaning. Master Ye says: The first three lines clarify two truths based on dharmas. The next three lines clarify two truths based on understanding. The third three and a half lines clarify two truths based on metaphors. (I privately say: These eight and a half verses have concise text but hidden meaning. Among them, the first three lines' sagely intention is increasingly difficult to fathom)

Scripture: "Characteristicless ultimate meaning..." up to "end of verse"

Master Ce says: First following the Original Record: The first verse clarifies that the essence of both truths is originally existent. The upper half is ultimate truth, the lower half is conventional truth. The next couplet uses three provisionals to distinguish the existence and non-existence of two truths. The latter verse removes the characteristics of existence and non-existence to distinguish the two truths. Master Zang says: The first verse establishes the chapter headings of conditions-emptiness-existence two truths. The next verse explains. The third verse concludes. Regarding "conditions originally self-existent" (the new version says "conditions are like illusory existence"): Master Ye says: The twelve-link dependent origination dharmas are always thus in the world. Regarding "ultimate meaning empty suchness": Master Ce says: Different name, repeated explanation. Also called "ultimate meaning emptiness." Emptiness is called "true suchness." Regarding "all existences originally existent dharmas, etc." (the new version says "all existences are illusory existent dharmas, etc."): Master Ye says: All existences of the three periods are similar and constantly seen, therefore called "originally existent." This original existence is not true—because three provisionals are assembled. Regarding "existence-nonexistence, no truth, truly non-existent": Examining various masters' meanings, most seem to take "already non-existent" as "non-non-existent." Regarding "illusion sees illusion, sentient beings are called illusory truth" (the new version says "illusion sees illusion, foolish people are called illusory truth"): Master Ye says: Deluded people see but don't know it's illusion. Regarding "illusory master sees, etc.": Master Ye says: Awakened people understand illusion and know it's not true.

Scripture: "Great King, bodhisattvas..." up to "dharmas are thus"

The new version says: "Bodhisattva mahāsattvas dwell in ultimate truth and transform all sentient beings. Buddhas and sentient beings are one without two. Why? Sentient beings and bodhi—these two are both empty. Through sentient beings' emptiness, one directly (the scripture writes 'places' instead of 'directly') obtains bodhi emptiness. Through bodhi emptiness, one places sentient beings' emptiness. Through all dharmas' emptiness, because of emptiness, it is empty. Why? Prajñā is characteristicless, and both truths are empty. That is, from ignorance to omniscience, there are no self-characteristics, no other-characteristics. In ultimate truth, seeing has nothing seen. If there is cultivation, one also doesn't grasp or attach. If there is no cultivation, one also doesn't grasp or attach, etc."

I privately say: This clarifies contemplative prajñā, therefore the text says "constantly illuminating two truths" and also says "five eyes accomplished, etc." Master Ye says: Third, explanatory answer. Master Ce says: Second, explaining the present Buddha's teaching of oneness and twoness meaning. The text separately has two parts. First, clarifying two meanings. Later, "Buddhas and..." below explains that one meaning. Regarding "in ultimate meaning constantly illuminating two truths, transforming sentient beings": Because of prajñā, constantly illuminating ultimate truth without attachment to birth-death, different from ordinary people. Because of great compassion, constantly illuminating conventional truth without attachment to nirvana, different from the two vehicles.

I privately say: This passage's meaning and purpose are extremely difficult to understand. What various masters explain is also not clear. Fearing prolixity, I don't quote them. Scholars should examine further. Now examining new and old versions, I humbly state my foolish view: The main point here is distinguishing the oneness and difference of two truths. That is, knowing that now speaking of "sentient beings and Buddhas as one and two" is precisely the oneness and difference of two truths. The above text explaining Buddha-fruit says: "Ultimate truth is constantly peaceful." Also says: "Sentient beings is a name of conventional truth." Taking Buddhas and sentient beings as ultimate and conventional truths—the scripture text is clear. The present text's meaning says: Although bodhisattvas dwell in non-dual principle, they illuminate Buddha-ultimate and sentient beings-conventional, teaching and transforming sentient beings to enter the Buddha-path.

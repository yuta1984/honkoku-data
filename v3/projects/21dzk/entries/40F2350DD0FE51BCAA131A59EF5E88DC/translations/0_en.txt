Preface to the Gokoku-shō (Notes on National Protection)
The Ninnō Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra is the foundation of all virtues. The techniques for warding off disasters and inviting blessings, and the practices of seeking enlightenment above and transforming beings below are all contained within this sutra. However, since ancient and simple expressions are intermixed, the meaning becomes increasingly profound and lofty. Although there are interpretations by various masters, we have not obtained the excellent explanations of our own school. Every time I attend lectures, I cannot help but sigh with regret.
Therefore, now I have examined new translations to supplement the old, collected different interpretations to extract the essentials, and compiled them into three volumes. I have named this "Gokoku-shō." This merely fulfills my own aspiration and does not dare hope for the world's trust. Third month of Kan'nin 2 (1018), Humble monk Kakuchō

My opinion: In interpreting this sutra, there are briefly four approaches. First, explaining the great meaning of the sutra; second, clarifying the five-fold mysterious principles; third, entering the text with structural analysis and interpretation; fourth, organizing through questions and answers.

First, in explaining the great meaning of the sutra, there are general and specific meanings. Generally speaking, the Prajñāpāramitā section teaches three doctrines, namely differences in doctrinal principles, wisdom and elimination, practices and stages, and causes and effects. Regarding principles: the Shared Teaching clarifies the principle of the two truths of illusory existence and immediate emptiness; the Distinct Teaching clarifies the principle of the three truths of illusory existence, immediate emptiness, neither existence nor emptiness; the Perfect Teaching clarifies the principle of the mutual identity of three truths where all phenomena tend toward existence, emptiness, and neither existence nor emptiness. One should keep this meaning in mind when reading the sutra text. Specifically speaking, there are also two meanings: internally protecting the Buddha fruit and ten stages, and externally protecting the nation and sentient beings.

Second, distinguishing the five-fold mysterious principles:
Buddha Expounds the Ninnō National Protection Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, Introductory Chapter, First
Master Jizang's commentary states: Tiantai Zhizhe extensively clarified five meanings among all sutras. Now regarding this section, following the example, we distinguish five approaches. First is explaining the name; second is revealing the sutra's essence; third is clarifying the sutra's principle; fourth is distinguishing the sutra's function; fifth is discussing the doctrinal characteristics. Regarding the first, explaining the name: because of self-awakening and awakening others, it is called Buddha; because sacred words are proclaimed and expressed, it is called "expounds." Bestowing favor and spreading virtue is called benevolence (nin); sovereign transformation and freedom is called king (ō).

Because one attains freedom within... The "wonderful enlightenment flower" refers to the flower of Buddha-fruit.
The sutra (National Protection chapter) states:
Four
Question: Regarding the flower of contemplating the middle path through conditions and the flower of thirty-seven practices, how is "contemplating the middle path through conditions" interpreted? Answer: The flower of the middle vehicle of pratyekabuddhas.
Question: This sutra teaches the dharma of five patience levels and ten stages. Regarding the expression "contemplating the middle path through conditions," shouldn't it be "directly contemplating the middle path"? Answer: Above, attaining the contemplation of the three vehicles is the same as the realm of no-birth. The commentary lists Buddha-flowers, middle path flowers, etc., and the thirty-seven practices are the path of śrāvakas. Therefore, there is no error.

Five
Question: The sutra text mentions wonderful enlightenment flowers scattered above the Buddha. What does this reveal? Answer: This means the great master bodhisattvas scattered wonderful enlightenment flowers. Regarding this, wonderful enlightenment flowers are flowers of the fruit stage. Why can bodhisattvas of the causal stage scatter these flowers?

Entrusting Chapter
One
Question: In the passages about eighty years, eight hundred years, etc., who maintains the teaching? Answer: The twenty-five masters. Question: Tiantai's twenty-third master appears in the world at nine hundred years. How is this? Answer: There are probably different theories about the twenty-five masters.

The sutra states:
The lower commentary states: "Eighty years" refers to after the Buddha's nirvana. In the hundred years after the Buddha's nirvana, five masters maintained the dharma, each for twenty years. The three people Kāśyapa, Ānanda, and Madhyāntika observed the Buddha's transformation and practiced the dharma as if the Buddha were still in the world, so it did not perish. The three people lasted sixty years, then the fourth Śāṇavāsin

[Page 28, Lower]
and the fifth Upagupta. These two masters each maintained the dharma for twenty years. Śāṇavāsin corresponds to eighty years. Because this person did not observe the Buddha's transformation, the dharma of deportment perished.
"Eight hundred years" refers to the extinction of the True and Semblance Dharma. Within five hundred years, the twenty-five masters were all sages who transmitted the teaching, so the realization-dharma did not perish. Within six to seven hundred years, Aśvaghoṣa and Nāgārjuna transmitted and propagated the dharma. Because these people were strong, the dharma did not perish. During eight hundred years, other people propagated the dharma, but because people were weak, they caused the dharma to perish. "Eight thousand years" refers to the extinction of the Semblance and Final Dharma. Because sentient beings in the Final Dharma period prefer to practice heterodox teachings and hate and destroy the True Dharma, the True Dharma is not practiced, therefore the Semblance and Final Dharma perish. According to the Nirvana Sutra, in the Semblance and Final age, there are 120,000 great bodhisattvas who well maintain my dharma, so my dharma does not perish. The previous statement about extinction referred to ordinary beings.

Two
Question: What does the passage "their lifespan decreases daily until reaching one hundred years" explain? Answer: As the text states. Question: Śākyamuni appeared in the world during the hundred-year period, so why does it say "their lifespan decreases daily until reaching one hundred years"?
Answer: "Abandoning one-third of the lifespan" refers to the meaning of 120 years of life, so it says thus. Or it doesn't mean human lifespan of one hundred years, but rather being separated from the next kalpa by one hundred years.
Challenging the previous interpretation: Śākyamuni had increasing physical strength and should have had a 120-year lifespan. Saying one hundred years means abandoning one-third according to the master's intention. Answer: That should also be called one theory.

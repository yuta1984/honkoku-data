"Subduing Light." Master Zang says: Using the non-contaminated [wisdom] of the previous thirty minds as cause and ignorance as condition, one experiences the transformational birth of the first ground outside the three realms. Kumāralaka - Master Zang says: In this region it is called "child ground." Because one is born into the Buddha's family. It is also called "ground of separation from desire" and also called "ground of conquering evil māras." The first ground separates from the five fears and surpasses the māras of the Two Vehicles. Master Ce says: If following the Original Record, it is translated as "conquering evil māras." The first ground separates from the five fears and surpasses the māras of the Two Vehicles. Master Ye says: This is entering the later stage. This is called "conquering evil māras." Regarding "constantly cultivating giving contemplation," regarding "four great treasure stores, etc.," among the various explanations made by the masters, both Masters Zang and Ye make one interpretation saying: If following the *Bodhisattvabhūmi*, benefiting beings through the four attractions is called the four great treasure stores. This accords with the new text.

Scripture: "Furthermore, virtuous wisdom" up to "all sentient beings"
The new translation says: Furthermore, the bodhisattva mahāsattva of the Stainless Ground has the four immeasurable minds in supreme tranquility, severing the habituations of anger, etc. Cultivating all practices, namely staying far from killing and not taking what is not given. Master Ce says: The fifth virtuous wisdom text has three parts. First indicating the distinct names of stages. Next explaining contemplation distinctions. Finally the time periods for entering stages. The three types of precept virtue arise together with wisdom, therefore called virtuous wisdom. Master Ye says: Virtue means upholding precepts. Virtuous wisdom means true pure śīla. Regarding "anger, etc. in the three realms of existence," Master Ce says: According to Sarvāstivāda, anger exists only in the desire realm. According to the Sautrāntika school, anger extends through the three realms. The *Yogācāra* teachings agree with Sarvāstivāda. Now following this sutra, we agree with the Sautrāntika explanation. Perhaps this sutra follows the conventional reasoning approach. Or the words are general while the meaning is specific. Anger, etc., based on reality do not

【Page 82 Lower】
extend to the upper realms. I personally say: According to the Tendai school's intention, still reaching to near-perfect awakening, how could the upper realms be separated? Jātadhara - Master Zang says: This is translated as "crossing dark ignorance." There is no more dark ignorance. It is also called "fearless ground." The Tripiṭaka Master translates it as "fulfillment." Master Ye says: This is entering the later stage. This is called "fulfillment."

Scripture: "Furthermore, luminous wisdom" up to "all dharmas"
The new translation says: Furthermore, the bodhisattva mahāsattva of the Radiant Ground dwells in non-discrimination, extinguishes the darkness of ignorance, and in signless patience attains the three illuminations. Master Ce says: The sixth text has three parts. First indicating the distinct names of stages. Next explaining contemplation distinctions. Finally the time periods for entering stages. Because one practices the three illumination contemplations, it is called luminous wisdom. Regarding Garādhara, Master Ce says: This means "crossing the edge." This stage separates from the various views of the remote and lowly, therefore. The authentic texts have not yet been examined. Master Zang says: This is entering the later stage. This is called "extensive recitation," reciting all dharma treasuries. It is also called "crossing edge ignorance."

Scripture: "Furthermore, Arcimāt" up to "constantly not departing from mind"
The new translation says: Furthermore, the bodhisattva mahāsattva of the Merit-Wisdom Ground cultivates conforming patience without any appropriation. Master Ce says: The seventh text has three parts. First indicating the distinct names of stages. Next revealing the distinct practices of grounds. Finally the time periods of practice. Arcimāt - Master Ce says: This means "mother of wisdom." It means that in this stage, the two emptinesses of persons and phenomena can generate the noble path, therefore called "mother of wisdom." Master Zang says: This is called "mother of wisdom." Having advanced to sever conceptual thought, it is called "awakened penetration." Objective realms can generate wisdom, using the objective realm as the mother of wisdom. Another interpretation: the *Daśabhūmika Sūtra* calls it "flame ground." This is metaphorical explanation. Master Ye says: Previously it was called "flame wisdom." Sacred awakened penetration both indicate wisdom. The *Daśabhūmivibhāṣā* says: Merit being

【Page 83 Upper】
conspicuous is called "flame." Someone says: Arcimāt is Sanskrit, meaning "mother of wisdom." Not mutually penetrating. Regarding "going against the stream of five views," Master Zang says: Fourth ground bodhisattvas can extinguish the habituations of the five view afflictions. Therefore the sutra says: With self-view as primary, all are completely distanced. The *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* says: The fourth ground severs innate self-view ignorance. Master Ce says: Based on reality, if the five views are distinguished, they are severed at the first ground stage. Now severing habituations is called "severing the five views." If not so, doubt is only what is severed by seeing. How can this be called "what is severed by the fifth ground"? Master Ye says: Both the Two Vehicles and pre-ground bodhisattvas have already severed these. Why does it say "against" here? The answer is: When Two Vehicle practitioners and those before the grounds contemplate person-emptiness, they can only separate from self-view and contemplate no-self. The mind of arising and ceasing still remains. Now upon ascending to the grounds, contemplating self and no-self, their nature is non-dual. The *Vimalakīrti* [Sutra] says: Regarding self and no-self being non-dual - this is the meaning of no-self. All views are likewise. Regarding stream-enterer, Master Zang's intention says: The first, second, and third grounds cultivating giving, precepts, and concentration are contaminated karma. From the fourth ground and above, cultivating the uncontaminated path and going against the stream of saṃsāra is called stream-enterer. Master Ce says: In this ground, generating the contemplation of path factors, going against the stream of five views, and accumulating immeasurable merit is called stream-enterer. Master Ye says: Conforming to true characteristic dharma-patience is called "following the stream." The Tiantai *Lotus Profound Meaning* volume four, in clarifying the distinct names and universal principles of ground stages, says: Question - From the first to seventh grounds corresponding to the four fruits, from what sutras and treatises does this come? Answer - Sutras and treatises do make correspondences, but the levels are not the same. Different masters make different correspondences. Some use the seeing ground only corresponding to the first ground, as used here. Some advance from the first and take three grounds, all corresponding to the first ground. The *Benevolent Kings* [Sutra] clarifies the fourth ground all corresponding to the first ground. It is difficult to make definitive judgments. However, the seeing ground of the Shared Teaching is fundamentally the path of no-interval. Without emerging from contemplation to realize

【Page 83 Lower】
stream-entry, how could the first ground sever seeing up to the third ground or the fourth ground?

Scripture: "Furthermore, excellent penetration" up to "non-departing mind"
Master Ce says: The eighth first indicates the distinct names of stages. Next reveals the distinct practices of grounds. Finally the time periods of cultivation. Because one can understand and penetrate the two and three truths, it is called "excellent penetration." It is also called "excellent wisdom." Regarding "contemplating nayuta truths, inner path treatises, outer path treatises, medical prescriptions, crafts, and spells, therefore I am a person of all-knowledge," Master Ce says: The all-knowledge fearlessness means having nothing unknown regarding the two objective realms. First, contemplating nayuta truths means the two and three truths and the eight truths, etc. Second, contemplating inner path treatises - these are the logical treatises among the five sciences. Outer path treatises are logical treatises and grammar. Medical prescriptions are medical treatises. Crafts and spells are all craft science treatises. Although these four science treatises extend through both inner and outer, now following one aspect, we provisionally speak of the outer ones. Regarding "I am a person of all-knowledge" - this is self-proclaiming one's virtuous title. Master Ye says: Path treatises are logic. Spells are grammar. The rest is the same as before. Master Zang says: Outer path treatises are the four Vedas. Regarding "extinguishing the three realms... the mark of self is exhausted," Master Ce says: This discusses the second exhaustion fearlessness. Knowing that each ground has what emerges, therefore called "emergence path." Master Ce says: This explains the fearlessness of emerging from suffering. Having what does not emerge, therefore called "obstruction path." Master Ce says: The fourth affliction that can obstruct the path fearlessness. Regarding "doubt in the three realms," Master Ce says: This is about habituations. Regarding once-returner, both Masters Zang and Ce say: Severing six categories of desire, one return among humans and gods. Master Zang also says: Some texts say the fourth ground severs desire realm conceptual [afflictions], the fifth ground severs form [realm] conceptual [afflictions], the sixth ground

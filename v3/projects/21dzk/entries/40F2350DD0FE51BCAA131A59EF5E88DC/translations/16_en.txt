The mind of dedication (ekō-shin) means directing even the slightest good toward bodhi. If one possesses these ten, one immediately enters the ten dwellings. Therefore they are explained together. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Initial arousal phase-faith" refers to people of the ten faiths who have not yet entered the ten dwellings. That is, initially arousing the mind but not yet seeing principle is called phase-faith. Master Nāgaśrī says: Before habitual seed-nature there are three kinds of mind-arousal: conceptual arousal, light arousal, and faith arousal. Conceptual arousal relies on three kinds of power: first is the power of good friends, meaning good spiritual guides; second is the power of practice, meaning receiving the gates of discipline; third is the power of dharma, meaning both universal and particular powers. Universal refers to the Tathāgata-garbha; particular refers to the five roots of faith etc. Depending on these three powers, toward Buddhas and bodhisattvas one conceptually arouses bodhicitta, seeking to bring peace to oneself and others. Just as śrāvakas observe things that are not blue and conceptually arouse blue perception to cure delusion, here too this is called conceptual arousal. After this, continuing to cultivate subsequent perception, the meaning is still difficult to understand, like light down having nowhere to rest - this is called light arousal. After this, the mind-path becomes increasingly clear and the jewel of faith manifests - this is called faith arousal. Because one enters the ten faith positions, it is called initial arousal phase-faith. "Sentient beings numerous as Ganges sands" indicates that many arouse the mind but few enter the positions. Therefore the sutra says: "Like fish roe and mango tree flowers, very few bear fruit." Cultivating patience of submission means cultivating the ten faiths as expedient means for patience of submission. Therefore the Necklace Sutra explains the "one worthy name-gate." That is, initially arousing the mind but not yet ascending above the pre-dwelling stage, there are ten accordance name-only bodhisattvas who constantly cultivate the ten minds - namely faith, vigor, mindfulness, concentration up to the mind of vows. It also says: "Practitioners in the conceptual mind stage before the ten dwellings have retrogressive good roots. From one kalpa to ten kalpas, cultivating the ten faiths, they are able to enter the ten dwellings." It also says: "Traditionally transmitted, there are two kinds of ten dwellings: distinct-characteristic ten dwellings are like the arousing mind dwelling etc. in the Necklace Sutra.

[Page 32, Lower]
Second are common-characteristic ten dwellings, taking faith-mind etc. as the ten dwellings. All positions practice the ten faith-minds. In this sutra it explains according to common characteristics." I say: If we follow this explanation, would practice and dedication also be thus? Also, regarding the ten cessations and ten firm minds explained below, do they each correspond to the ten positions, or are they possessed horizontally across all positions?

Sutra: Next in sequence arises dry-wisdom inherent seed-nature with ten kinds of minds, namely: the four foundations of mindfulness are body, feelings, mind, dharmas - impurity, suffering, impermanence, non-self. The three foundations of mindfulness are the three good roots - loving-kindness, giving, wisdom. The three foundations of mindfulness are the three times - past cause patience, present cause-and-effect patience, future effect patience. This bodhisattva can also transform all sentient beings, already able to transcend the knowledge and views of self and person, thoughts of sentient beings and such, and the inverted thoughts of non-Buddhists that cannot destroy them.

I say: The character "dry" in some texts is written as "withered." Master Jizang agrees with this. Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Withered" is a textual error. Master Dōeki says: Some write the character "withered" - this means withered-seeking, which is not the usage here. The new translation says: "Furthermore, inherent seed-nature bodhisattvas cultivate ten kinds of pāramitās, arousing ten counteractions, namely observing body, feelings, mind, dharmas." The first fascicle says: "The previous ten understandings are still weak, therefore called phase-faith, not yet given the name wisdom. This seeming understanding is somewhat cut off, therefore given the designation wisdom. Showing that its principle-moisture is still slight, therefore given the name dry-wisdom." Master Jizang says: "In Hīnayāna dharma, outside of habitual seed there is separately dry-wisdom, not yet obtaining principle-understanding moistening the mind. Therefore now, in contrast to first-ground true understanding, the seed-nature is called dry-wisdom ground." The four foundations of mindfulness - Master Dōeki says: "These are the four foundations of mindfulness contemplation. Because early translations were not correct, they were called foundations of mindfulness." Master Huirui says: "Dharma Master Kumārajīva, in determining sutra names and numbers, said: change 'foundations of mindfulness' to 'foundations of mindfulness,' 'right cutting-off' to 'right effort,'

[Page 33, Upper]
awakened mind true practice to the eightfold path." Speaking of "foundations of mindfulness" - they can stop the four inversions. Speaking of "four foundations of mindfulness" - correctly mindful cultivation of practice. Loving-kindness, giving, wisdom are non-hatred, non-greed, non-delusion. This has two meanings: directly having no three poisons is called cessation-good; adding cultivation of loving-kindness, giving, wisdom practices is good. The various masters' intentions are the same. Past cause patience etc. - Master Jizang says: "Past ignorance and formations are called cause patience; three causes and five effects in the present are called cause-and-effect patience; future birth and old age-death are called effect patience." Master Dōeki agrees.

Sutra: Furthermore there are ten path seed-nature grounds, namely: observing form, consciousness, perception, feeling, formations, obtaining precept patience, knowledge-and-vision patience, concentration patience, wisdom patience, liberation explanation patience, observing three-realm cause-and-effect emptiness patience, wishlessness patience, signlessness patience, observing two truths' falsity and reality - all dharmas' impermanence called impermanence patience, all dharmas empty obtaining no-arising patience. This bodhisattva with ten firm minds becomes a wheel-turning king, also able to transform and give birth to good roots of all sentient beings in the four continents.

Master Wŏnch'ŭk cites the sutra saying: "Furthermore, good son cultivates superior patience of submission, advancing to enter the equal path, called path seed-nature ground." The new translation says: "Furthermore, path seed-nature bodhisattvas cultivate ten dedications, arousing ten patience minds, namely observing the five aggregates - form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness - obtaining precept patience, concentration patience, wisdom patience, liberation patience, liberation knowledge-and-vision patience." Master Jizang says: "This sutra calls it path seed-nature; the Flower Garland calls it ten dedications. The first is called 'dedication of rescuing and protecting all sentient beings while being free from the characteristics of sentient beings,' up to the tenth called 'dedication of the infinite dharma-realm.'" Master Wŏnch'ŭk says: "Because this serves as causal nature for the sacred path, it is called path seed-nature. Observing the form aggregate, one immediately obtains precept patience. Manifest and non-manifest precepts are all form aggregate. According to this sutra text, manifest and non-manifest precepts are all form. Observing the consciousness aggregate, one obtains knowledge-and-vision patience, because discriminating consciousness and knowledge-vision wisdom are concordant in meaning.

[Page 34, Lower]
Observing the perception aggregate, one obtains concentration patience, also because those conceptual perceptions can enter concentration, like the four formless states obtained through perception. Observing the feeling aggregate, one obtains wisdom patience, because depending on feelings the four dhyānas are established, and through dhyāna one can generate wisdom. Therefore observing feelings one obtains wisdom patience." Liberation patience is the liberation body. Liberation has two kinds: first is conditioned liberation, which is superior understanding; second is unconditioned liberation. Through cutting off afflictions included in the formations aggregate, one particularly obtains superior understanding included in the formations aggregate, called liberation patience. Being sovereign in regard to objects is called liberation. It also says: "Observing the conventional obtains impermanence patience; observing the ultimate obtains no-arising patience." Master Dōeki says: "Awakening to form being empty is precept patience; understanding the six false consciousnesses' nature as non-discriminating is knowledge-and-vision patience; understanding that the nature of feelings like suffering, pleasure, worry, joy has no different flavors is called concentration patience; understanding perceptions and images as non-grasping is called wisdom patience; observing formations as non-dwelling... bondage is liberation patience." Having conceptual mind confusion as counteraction is called concentration, feelings... is called wisdom. Though this seems to accord with the text in one respect, when exhausting principle it ultimately loses the primary correspondence. Generally called patience because it accords with principle, therefore called patience. Master Liangbian's intention says: "Observing faults of body and speech, preventing and guarding the seven supports obtains precept patience; observing the feeling aggregate falsely generating appropriation, through concentration's focused attention obtains concentration patience; observing the perception aggregate grasping images of enemies etc. obtains wisdom patience; observing the formations aggregate creating various karmas binding birth-and-death obtains liberation patience; observing the consciousness aggregate's false conceptual discrimination arising various knowledge-and-views and grasping the six sense-objects obtains liberation knowledge-and-vision patience. This is established according to the sequence of verbal explanation. According to true meaning, non-discriminating wisdom observing the five aggregates as empty, in each moment-to-moment all possess the five patiences." Regarding two truths' falsity and reality etc., Master Dōeki says: "Conventional is false, ultimate is real. Because conventional arises from conditions, it is non-

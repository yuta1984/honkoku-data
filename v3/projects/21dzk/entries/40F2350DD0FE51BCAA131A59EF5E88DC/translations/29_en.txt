"Dwelling depending on dharma-nature. Since dharma-nature is not affliction, it is immediately non-dwelling." (I privately say: Using these passages, one should investigate the distinctions between the initial single thought, consciousness original grade, ignorance, non-dwelling root, etc. The essential point of mind-observation lies only in this.)

Regarding "initial single thought," etc. Master Ce says: "Question: Do all sentient beings have a root source of birth-and-death or not? If one says there is, how does the sūtra explain 'the root source of sentient beings cannot be known'? If one says there is not, how can what this sūtra explains be understood?" (Examine the Neither-Increase-Nor-Decrease Sūtra, etc.) The explanation: Various schools are not the same. There are four logical positions. First, having beginning but no end: Established within the Mahīśāsaka school. Sometimes manifesting sentient beings, existing according to conditions, as explained in Paramārtha's Treatise on Distinct Schools. Although that school has no established text, doctrinally it explains there are no nirvāṇa-nature and indestructible Buddha-fruit, thus completing the first position. Second, no beginning but having end: Like the Sarvāstivāda school, Sautrāntika school, and the fixed-nature two vehicles within Mahāyāna. Third, having beginning and having end: Like the Mahīśāsaka school doctrine. (Examining this, in the Mahīśāsaka scholastic treatise it's called the Authentic Ground School) Two-vehicle sages enter the remainder-less stage. Fourth, no beginning and no end: Those without nirvāṇa-nature, indeterminate seed-nature, and bodhisattva seed-nature, as in the Yogācāra, etc. "Diamond termination" - Master Zang says: For Hīnayāna, it's the termination of birth-and-death by installments; for Mahāyāna, it's the termination of inconceivable transformation. "Root of sentient beings" (Masters Zang, Ye, etc. attribute this to the end of the previous sentence. This seems to follow the text. Master Ce attributes it to the following sentence. This is still unclear.)

Regarding "form names," etc. Master Ye says: "The text clarifying the provisional has three parts: first, regarding the aggregates; second, regarding sense-spheres and sense-entrances; third, regarding provisional and real. The general meaning of these three clarifies that one dharma and many dharmas constitute the provisional assembly, therefore not real." Master Ce says: "Form and mind constitute aggregates." (And so on) Regarding "body name accumulation": Master Ce says: "Explaining the meaning of body-name. All five-aggregate dharmas are called body. This is precisely the meaning of aggregates." (I privately say this follows the new version) Master Ye says: "Because of accumulating the five aggregates, it's called body. Body is provisional." Master Zang's meaning is the same. This text is unclear. Scholars should consider it. Regarding "Great King, this single form brush": Master Ce says: "Form and mind constitute the twelve sense-spheres." "Firm maintenance," etc. refers to the four creative elements.

【Page 58 Lower】
Great elements. "Producing five form-spheres," etc. means producing the five sense-organs. "Thus one mind," etc. is the general conclusion. The reason the explanation doesn't mention mind is for brevity. (The above is Master Ce's meaning; Masters Zang, Ye, etc. generally agree)

Regarding "ordinary beings' six consciousnesses are coarse," etc. Master Zang says: "Ordinary beings' six consciousnesses grasp dharmas in general characteristics, therefore it says they obtain blue and yellow of conventional names. Sages distinguish the four subtle elements, etc., therefore they obtain reality." He also says: "Sages condition the dharma-realm's six consciousnesses and obtain true-reality dharmas." Master Ye says: "Ordinary beings [possibly missing the character 'see'] coarse square and round provisional dharmas. Sages see the four sense-dust dharmas of form, smell, taste, and touch. This is reality within conventional truth. Compared to the provisional dharmas of square and round, it's called real. It's not the meaning of ultimate truth." (I privately add one translation: "What ordinary beings experience as birth-and-death-by-installments forms, etc. are called provisional; what sages experience as dharma-nature forms, etc. are called real") Master Ce has various explanations but cannot elaborate them all.

Scripture: "Sentient beings..." up to "called illusory truth" (The new translation says: "Good sons, the reception of sentient beings is established depending on the conventional. Whether existent or non-existent, it only produces sentient beings' false conceptualization and recollection. Creating karma and receiving results are all called conventional truth. All sentient beings in the three realms and six destinies—brahmins, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, śūdras, self-person-views, form-dharmas and mind-dharmas—are like what is seen in dreams.")

Master Ce says: "Second, clarifying reception-provisional. Distinguished by four approaches: first, two-truths distinction approach; second, existence-nonexistence approach; third, six-destinies approach; fourth, four-castes approach." Master Ye agrees. Regarding "names of conventional truth": Master Ce says: "First is the two-truths approach. The five aggregates that can constitute are called dharma-provisional; the constituted person is called reception-provisional. Such reception-provisional is the name of conventional truth." Master Ye says: "Sentient beings are receivers of worldly false sentiments. Buddha names them according to conventional truth, not ultimate truth." Regarding "whether existent or non-existent" up to "existent because of illusion" (According to Master Ce's citation. If following Master Ye's meaning, "conventional truth false deception" belongs to the following six-paths approach.)

Master Ce says: "Second is the existence-nonexistence approach. Because there are provisional ones, they are named as existent. Because they're not real in nature, they're also explained as non-existent." Master Ye says: "Dharmas of existence and non-existence are all sentient beings' false sentiments. Recollection and attachment [possibly 'attachment' should be 'person'] are not truly existent." (I privately say: "False attachment having no reality is called non-existent; depending on conditions and provisionally existing is called existent") Up to "six paths illusory...

...transformation sentient beings seeing illusory transformation." Master Ce says: "Third is the six-destinies approach." "Illusory transformation seeing illusory transformation" up to "illusory truth." Master Ce says: "Fourth is the four-castes approach. This has two explanations. First: 'Illusory transformation seeing illusory transformation' generally indicates that both the capable-transforming and object-transformed are all illusory transformation. 'Brahmins, etc.' dually reveals that both capable-transforming and object-transformed all possess the four castes. Divine-self and sentient beings possessing complete form and mind are all called illusory truth. Second: Speaking of 'illusory transformation' indicates the person capable of transformation. 'Seeing illusory transformation,' etc. are all the transformed objects." Master Ye says: "Brahmin means 'external intention' (external intention—Blue Dragon says this means 'peaceful aspiration') pure-conduct caste. Kṣatriya means 'field-master'—the royal caste. Vaiśya are farmers. Śūdra are merchants and traders. Divine-self, etc. are non-Buddhist calculations. Form and mind, etc. are Hīnayāna calculations." Master Ben says: "Saying 'vaiśya' follows ancient translation; newly called 'vaiśya' means merchant. Saying 'śūdra' also follows ancient translation; newly called 'caṇḍāla' means farmer."

Scripture: "Illusory truth dharma" up to "mind-dharma form-dharma" (The new translation says: "Good sons, all names are provisionally established. Before Buddha's appearance, conventional truth illusory dharmas had no names, no meanings, also no substance or characteristics, no names of three realms, good-evil retributions, or six-path designations. When buddhas appear, for the sake of sentient beings they explain countless names of three realms, six destinies, defiled and pure. All such are like calling sounds and echoes.")

Master Ce says: "Third explains name-provisional." Master Ye agrees. Regarding "no name-characters, no meaning-names": Master Ce says: "When Buddha had not yet appeared, there were no capable-explaining name-characters and also no explained meanings." Regarding "names equal to empty dharma," etc.: Master Ye says: "This points to established dharmas." Master Ce says: "As explained, constituting sentient beings' bodies has those seven names. Empty dharma is empty-sphere form. The four great elements make four. Mind-dharma and form-dharma. Such name-characters are not of one type."

Scripture: "Continuity dharma" up to "continuity truth" (The new translation says: "All dharmas continue, moment by moment not abiding, instant by instant, neither one nor different, quickly arising and quickly perishing, neither断 nor constant. All conditioned dharmas are like mirages.")

【Page 59 Lower】
Master Ce says: "Fourth clarifies continuity-provisional. As the fundamental record says: First is eternalist view—before and after being one with no meaning of cessation. 'Different' is annihilationist view—before and after each being different with no meaning of continuity. One also [the commentary has the character 'not' below 'also'] doesn't continue—having no meaning of continuity. Different also doesn't continue—being distinctly separate bodies with no meaning of continuity." Master Zang says: "Continuity-provisional differs from the Satyasiddhi masters." (And so on) Same as Master Ye's previous meaning. Also the same in not speaking of annihilation and eternalism.

Scripture: "Mutually dependent provisional dharma" up to "all equal dharma" (The new translation says: "All dharmas are mutually dependent—namely form-sphere, eye-sphere, eye-consciousness-sphere, up to dharma-sphere, mind-sphere, mind-consciousness-sphere. Like knowing lightning. Indefinite mutual dependence, existence-nonexistence, oneness-difference, like a second moon.")

Master Ce says: "Fifth explains mutual-dependence-provisional. The text separately has two parts. First indicating two types: First, mutually avoiding mutual dependence, or called 'definite mutual dependence'—like all dharmas mutually depending in turn. Second, mutually seizing mutual dependence, also called 'indefinite mutual dependence'—like a one-foot object being sometimes long, sometimes short, because what is referenced differs." Volume One says: "Ancient explanation of mutual dependence: All names mutually depend, also called indefinite mutual dependence. Mutual dependence has two types. Initially called 'all name-character mutual dependence'—this is mutually avoiding mutual dependence. Like various trees and stones naturally having name-types [possibly missing the character 'type' after 'type'] that are not the same. These names are definite. Indefinite refers to mutually seizing mutual dependence, like long-short, large-small, etc." Master Zang says: "Mutual dependence provisional has two types, also called 'distinct dependence' and also called 'universal dependence.' Like long-short, old-young, good-bad are called distinct dependence. Like long depending on not-long—all myriad things are indefinite. Outside of not-long, according to obtaining [the commentary changes 'obtaining' to 'depending on'] one thing, therefore called indefinite. Also called universal dependence." Master Ye says: "All names mutually depending refers to long-short, high-low, etc. Also called indefinite mutual dependence. Like...

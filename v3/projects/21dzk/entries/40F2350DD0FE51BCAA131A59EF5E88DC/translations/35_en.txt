difficulty of being after Buddha. Fifth, border region difficulty. Sixth, deaf, blind, and mute difficulty. Seventh, worldly wisdom and eloquence difficulty. Eighth, long-life heaven. Master Ye says: Exclude border regions and add the northern continent. Master Ce quotes the Ekottara Āgama saying: The three evil destinies make three. Fourth, long-life heaven. Fifth, being born in border regions, slandering sages and creating various evil karmas. Sixth, being born in the central region but lacking complete six sense faculties and unable to distinguish good and evil. Seventh, being born in the central region with complete six sense faculties but having wrong views in consciousness. Eighth, Buddha does not appear and does not teach the dharma.

Scripture: "Great King, in former days" up to "karmic retribution in the present life"
Master Ce says: Citing ancient examples for the present has two parts. First citing Indra. Second citing Pūrṇamaṇḍala. Master Ye says: First citing the great king, later citing the human king. Master Ben says: Citing the past has three parts. First clarifying the heavenly king. Second clarifying the human king. Third exemplifying and pointing to various kings. According to my investigation, citing the past has two parts. First clarifying the heavenly king. Second clarifying the human king. The human king also has two parts. First clarifying Pūrṇamaṇḍala. Later clarifying the five thousand kings.

Scripture: "Great King, in former days" up to "explained in the Sin-Eliminating Sutra"
I say: First citing Indra. Examining the Bhadrakalpika Sutra, fascicle 13, it says: In the past there was a great king named Gusali. He ruled this world. A blister grew on his head, and when split open, they obtained one child. They established the name Mandhatr (in Jin dynasty called "Crown-born"). King Crown-born enjoyed the five desires in Jambudvīpa for 84,000 years. He traveled Pūrvavideha for 800 million years. Going to Aparagodānīya for 1.4 billion years. Northern Uttarakuru for 4.8 billion years. After several billion years in the four heavenly realms, he ascended to Trāyastriṃśa Heaven. Indra shared his throne

and ruled in heaven receiving the pleasures of five desires. Through thirty-six Indras, the final Indra was Kāśyapa Bodhisattva. Crown-born thought to himself: "Now I sit together with Indra - what is this for? Wouldn't it be pleasant to harm him and rule alone?" Having generated this evil mind, he immediately fell. Examining the Nirvana Sutra, fascicle 11, it says: In the past there was a king named Supratiṣṭhita. A flesh blister grew on his head, gradually increasing without considering it a problem. After ten months were full, the blister split and one child was born. He was named Crown-born. Immediately there was a golden wheel-treasure in the east. At that time the sage-king ascended to Trāyastriṃśa Heaven. Śakra Devānām Indra saw him, took his hand, ascended to the Sudharmā Hall and shared his seat. The sage-king immediately generated the thought: "Should I not rather depose that king's position and immediately dwell therein as heavenly king?" At that time Indra was upholding, reciting, and chanting Mahāyāna scriptures, explaining and analyzing them for others. This Crown-born King generated evil thoughts toward this Indra and immediately fell. That Indra was Kāśyapa Buddha, and the wheel-turning sage-king was my own body. The Tiantai Lotus Sutra Commentary clarifies Mahākāśyapa's causes and conditions, saying: Formerly there was a sage-king called Mandhatr. His talents were exceptionally outstanding. The heavenly emperor admired his virtue and sent a thousand-horse chariot to build a palace and welcome the king. The emperor came out to wait and sat together with the king. After enjoying themselves together, he sent the king back to his palace. Formerly Kāśyapa commanded me to sit together with the seat of birth and death. Now that I have become Buddha, I repay his past merit with the seat of correct dharma. The commentary says: King Mandhatr is Crown-born King. Regarding inviting one hundred dharma teachers, fascicle one says: Heaven has no monastic dharma. There are traditionally two explanations. First, through Indra's spiritual power, dharma teachers from the human realm are made to dwell in heaven. Second, the various devas are able to protect, thus they are dharma teachers. It is not necessarily about monasticism. What is now clarified is that these are all skillful means of the noble path

How can one grasp through characteristics? Regarding the Sin-Eliminating Sutra, Master Ce says: This is precisely the Nirvana Sutra (Master Zang agrees). Or it may not yet be translated (Someone says: Making Nirvana the Sin-Eliminating Sutra is because King Ajātaśatru eliminated sins). I say: If pointing to Nirvana as the Sin-Eliminating Sutra, how does this sutra relate temporally to Nirvana?

Scripture: "Great King, formerly there was" up to "explained in the Ten Kings' Grounds"
Master Ce says: The second citation of Pūrṇamaṇḍala has two parts. First clarifying difficult matters. Later from "that Pūrṇamaṇḍala" explaining the ability to protect from difficulties. According to my investigation, the text has two parts. First properly clarifying Pūrṇamaṇḍala's matter. Later pointing to the Ten Kings' Grounds.

Scripture: "Great King, formerly there was" up to "called King Pūrṇamaṇḍala"
Regarding Tiānluó Kingdom, the Tiantai Lotus Sutra Commentary says: The kingdom name is Magadha. This means "non-harm" - having no laws of punishment and execution. Also called Magadhi. This means Tiānluó. Tiānluó means naming the kingdom after the king. This king is precisely the name of Kalmāṣapāda's father king. One name being "Spotted Foot" - Master Ce quotes sutras and treatises presenting variant names saying: King Kalmāṣapāda. In Chinese "spotted foot." Also called "striped foot." Also called "deer king." Because the foot stripes resemble a deer, named "deer foot." Also named "Two-wings King." Also named "Agrouped-beings." According to my investigation, the Bhadrakalpika Sutra, fascicle 11, says: In the past there was a great kingdom named Vārāṇasī. The king's name was Brahmadatta. Leading four types of troops, he traveled hunting and playing. Chasing animals, he alone reached deep forest. Extremely tired, he rested a little. There was a female lion with lustful mind who approached nearby, raised her tail and stood with back turned. The king, out of fear, completed the sexual act. The lion became pregnant, and when the months were complete, gave birth to one child. The form was entirely human-like, but only the feet were spotted. The lion immediately carried it in her mouth and placed it before the king. The king

【Page 71 Lower】
recognized this as his own child and immediately took and raised it. Because the feet were spotted, he was named Kalmāṣapāda (in Jin called "Spotted Foot"). After the father king died, Spotted Foot succeeded in ruling. There was one sage whom the king constantly made offerings to. He did not eat fine food but only ate coarse offerings. One day the sage did not come. A heavenly spirit knew this, transformed into his form, and entered the royal palace. He ordered the preparation of fish and meat delicacies. The next day the old sage flew over. Various meat delicacies were prepared. The sage became angry and said: "Make the king constantly eat human flesh for the next twelve years." Afterward the kitchen supervisor forgot and did not prepare meat. When the time came there was no plan. Seeing a dead small child, he immediately removed the head and feet, carried it to the kitchen, made food and gave it to the king. The king said: "This meat is extremely delicious." Dead children are hard to obtain. He secretly captured and killed them. The ministers prepared troops and immediately surrounded their king. They were about to capture and kill him. The king spoke to the ministers: "From now on I will never do this again. Please just forgive and release me." The ministers would not release him. The king immediately made this vow: "Through the good deeds my body has cultivated from the beginning, may I transform into a flying rakshasa." Following his words it was accomplished. He immediately flew into empty space, capturing people for food. Various rakshasa bands attached themselves as followers. The multitude caused much harm and it spread widely. The rakshasas said: "Please make one banquet for us." Spotted Foot immediately granted this, saying: "Capture various kings to make five hundred complete." He had already obtained 499 kings. One king remained. The kings thought: "We are in dire straits - where shall we turn? If Sudāsoma could be captured, he has great skillful means and could save us all." Having made this plan, they spoke to the rakshasa king. The rakshasa king flew over, took and carried him to the mountains. Sudāsoma was sorrowful and wept. Spotted Foot said: "Your reputation and virtue are supremely excellent, a first-rate man. Why do you wail and cry like a small child?" Sudāsoma addressed the rakshasa king: "I do not cherish body and life. But since birth I have never spoken false-

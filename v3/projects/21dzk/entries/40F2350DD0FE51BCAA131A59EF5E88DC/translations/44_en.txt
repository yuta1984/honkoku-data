Reversing the previous seven difficulties to make seven blessings. Also: first, ten thousand people love and honor the king; second, the four seas submit in reverence; third, enemies retreat and scatter; fourth, the king loves his own body; fifth, the four directions sing praises; sixth, the people prosper and are joyful; seventh, in the future they enter the good path. Regarding "sun and moon losing their course, etc.," Master Ce says: seasonal changes often cause famine, numerical changes often cause wars to arise, and color changes often cause diseases. Master Zang says: All of these are signs of famine, warfare, and epidemics. Regarding "the twenty-eight constellations, etc.," Master Zang says: Each of the four directions has seven, making four times seven equals twenty-eight. Because they move without following the constant way, it's called "losing their course." Venus is the Great White Star. If it moves according to principle, there will be abundance; if it loses its course, there will be famine. Comet stars are called Yama King Stars in foreign countries. Wherever they appear, there will certainly be disasters. Wheel stars have brilliance like wheels. If the sun, moon, and five planets break through the center of the wheel star, then the country will be scattered. If the sun, moon, and five planets move to the right of the wheel star, then the country will be peaceful. Moving to the left is also not good. Regarding ghost stars, in mid-September the sun sets in the northeast. If the movement is fast, it exceeds the seasonal timing. If it approaches above, then ghosts and spirits will come to destroy the country and sicken people. Mars is the Confusion Star. This governs bandits. If it is high, then bandits arise; if low, then bandits are subdued. If in the zi position, then it's low; if in wu, it's high. Regarding Mercury, if it moves from the rooster position, there's no water; from the rabbit position, there's much water; from the ox position, neither much nor little. Regarding Wind Star, if high, there's much wind and no rain; if low, much rain and little wind. Regarding Sword Star, if high, there are many weapons, and beings suffer famine and disease; if low, few weapons. The Southern and Northern Dippers are not constellations but luminaries. The five town great stars are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Regarding the country's ruler, three ministers, and hundred officials, if good stars enter these star positions, then there will be

great peace and joy. If evil stars enter, then there will be great suffering. Following various stars moving together without relying on the constant way, therefore it says "each manifests changes." Regarding ghost fire, ghosts become angry at beings and evil fire arises at night. It also causes people to have fever. Regarding dragon fire, dragons become angry and rain poisonous fire, causing people to have swelling. This is the fire of karmic supernatural powers. Heaven fire and thunderbolt fire take their names from heaven. Regarding spirit fire, there are two kinds of spirits: first, immortals' angry fire arising from anger; second, immortals recite spells causing ghosts and spirits to burn people's homes. Human fire gets its name in relation to humans. Tree fire can be understood. Bandit fire - when bandits throw fire, it's immediately called bandit fire. Regarding "red water, etc.," raining red water causes much warfare; raining black water causes disease; raining blue water causes much famine. Raining stones, earth, and mountains is due to immortals' and rākṣasas' anger. Rivers flowing backward and seas overflowing indicate bandits. Regarding "black wind, etc.," it blows black, red, blue sand at the seaside. Heaven-earth wind means heaven is yang and earth is yin. Fire wind is hot wind. Master Ben says: Dragon fire means thunderbolts starting fires; ghost fire can cause epidemics. Human fire means worldly five-power holders encountering present adverse conditions and intentionally starting fires. Tree fire means extreme yang meeting the season causing trees to start fires. Great fires arising in four directions means unwholesome karma ripening and fires starting everywhere.

Scripture: "Great King, this prajñā" up to "like serving Indra"

Master Ye says: The third part praises the name and encourages offerings. Text in two parts: first praising eight names, second showing three offerings.

Scripture: "Great King, this prajñā" up to "Dragon Treasure Spirit King"
The new translation says: Prajñāpāramitā can give birth to all buddha dharmas, all bodhisattva liberation dharmas, all kings' supreme dharmas, all sentient beings' liberation dharmas. Like a maṇi jewel whose essence possesses all virtues, it can subdue poisonous dragons and various evil ghosts and spirits, can follow what people's minds seek and satisfy them, can respond to wheel-turning kings and be called wish-fulfilling jewels, can cause great dragon kings like Nanda and Upananda to send down sweet rain moistening vegetation. If placed on a high banner in dark night, its light illuminates heaven and earth, bright like sunrise. This prajñāpāramitā is also thus. Master Ye says: "Mind spirit source" - that which penetrates the mysterious is called spirit. Prajñā is fundamental awakening, not false and not untrue, therefore called "source." Its protective care is weighty like parents. It can remove the seven difficulties like divine talismans. It controls evil ghosts like a wheel-turning king's ghost-repelling jewel. It can gather a hundred blessings like a dragon king's wish-fulfilling jewel. Protecting the country and pacifying the state is called the "country-protecting jewel." Illuminating cause and effect is called the "heaven-earth mirror." Majestic virtue and sovereignty is called "Dragon Treasure Spirit King." Master Zang says: All buddhas, through prajñā, awaken to non-attainment. Being the buddha-mother, it's called "buddha source." Sentient beings' mind-consciousness is fundamentally without attainment. Through deluded imagination as cause and condition, there are six-path distinctions. If one knows non-existence and returns to prajñā, therefore it's called "sentient beings' mind-consciousness spirit source." Mind, consciousness, and spirit are one essence with different names. Another explanation: mind-consciousness spirit source means taking tathāgatagarbha as the source of life and death. Divine talisman means being able to subdue heavenly demons and non-Buddhists and protect worldly and transcendent good roots. Heaven-earth mirror means illuminating the world's non-existence. Dragon Treasure Spirit King means being able to produce

all good spirits. Master Ce says: Because it can protect body and life, it's compared to divine talismans. The Original Record says: Before and after the path, purity without difference is called "Dragon Treasure Spirit King." Cannot extensively quote.

Scripture: "Buddha told the Great King" up to "like serving Indra"
Master Du says: Showing three offerings. First showing banners and flowers for adorning offerings, second showing offerings while traveling, third showing offerings while dwelling. Master Ce says: Text in two parts. First showing offering methods, then separately showing traveling and dwelling offerings. Master Zang says: First are separate matter offerings; from "daily" below, next comprehensively offering with flowers and incense. Regarding "nine-colored banners, etc.," Masters Ce and Zang say there are six items: first banners, second flowers, third lamps, fourth jade boxes, fifth jade covers, sixth seven treasures. According to Master Ye: Using banners and flowers to adorn them, lamp light to illuminate them, jade boxes to contain them, jade covers to cover them, seven-treasure stands to place them. Master Ce says: Regarding nine colors, according to the Original Record: white, black, yellow, red, blue - these are the five dust colors, plus the four great element colors making nine. The four great element colors are: earth makes ash color, water makes crystal color (crystal), fire makes light color (fire jewels), wind makes smoke color. Regarding "when the king travels, etc.," according to tradition, in western places where there is buddha-dharma, kings of all countries use prajñā as the country-stabilizing treasure. When the king goes out, using the sutra as a guide, the country's borders immediately become free of disasters. Regarding "commanding a thousand li," Master Ye says: Prajñā's majestic spiritual light is limitless. Responding to what is sought, it briefly says "thousand."

Scripture: "Great King, I now" up to "and make offerings to it"
Master Ye says: Fourth, showing what can protect and encouraging offerings. Text in two parts: first clarifying the arising of difficulties, second, from "Great King, if in the future" below, showing

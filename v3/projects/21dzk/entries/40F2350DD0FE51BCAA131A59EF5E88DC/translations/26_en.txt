Regarding "all suffering-experience-actions are empty," Master Soku says: "Suffering from suffering, suffering from decay, and suffering from formations are all called 'suffering-experience.' These three experiences are all conditioned formations." Master Eki says: "This self and self-possessions are suffering due to being entirely defiled, experience due to false attachment, action due to conditioned transmigration. The deluded consider them existent, but wisdom illuminates and knows emptiness. If self and person are already empty, how can sentient beings have bondage-liberation or cause-effect? Everything else is the same. Regarding 'five aggregates without combination, etc.,' dharma-emptiness can be understood. Regarding 'tranquilly empty therefore,' Master Zō connects it to the following sentence, not following the new version. The various masters connect it above."

Sūtra: "Dharma-realm emptiness... to... no mind-attainment"

Master Soku says: "The second clarifies the inconceivable through mutual opposition of realm and wisdom. First clarifying realm-emptiness, then from 'prajñā without knowledge' down explaining wisdom-emptiness." Master Eki's meaning is the same. Regarding dharma-realm emptiness, Master Soku says: "Clarifying total emptiness" (I say: "The character 'dharma' should be contemplated"). Regarding emptiness, no-characteristics, non-turning (the new version says "emptiness, no-characteristics, non-action." Master Soku says: "Non-turning is the realm of the wishless samādhi. Since the defilement of suffering and accumulation is unattainable, there is no defilement or purity"), regarding non-inversion (the new version says "not following inversion"), regarding not following phantom transformation (the new text is the same), regarding no Three Jewels, etc. I say: "The Great Sūtra explains eleven emptinesses, first saying there are no Tathāgata, Dharma, or Saṅgha, then saying Tathāgata, Dharma, Saṅgha, and Buddha-nature—these four dharmas are permanent, blissful, self, and pure, therefore not called empty. The commentary says: 'Previously saying "without" means negating conceptual constructions outside principle. Later saying "not without" refers to the true dharma within principle.'" Today's sūtra should be understood similarly; scholars should think well. Regarding no-knowledge, no-seeing, non-acting, non-conditioning, non-same (the new version says "non-abandoning"), non-receiving, etc., Master Soku says: "The second wisdom-emptiness has three parts: first dharma, next analogy, then from 'dharma-characteristics' down, combining. This (the commentary writes 'comparison') measuring is called knowledge. Investigating and seeking is called seeing. Traversing realms is called acting. Planning and considering is called conditioning. Attracting results is called cause. Receiving and accepting is called receiving." Master Eki says: "Illuminating the true mind of no-characteristics, having no discrimination, therefore no knowledge. Not grasping characteristics, therefore no seeing. Not arising or acting, therefore no action. Not depending on other realms to

arise, therefore no conditioning. Having no before-and-after thoughts, therefore no cause. Not grasping or clinging, therefore no receiving. This clarifies the essence of prajñā" (I say: "Not detailed"). Regarding "not attaining all illumination-characteristics, etc." (the new version says: "Correctly dwelling in observation yet without illumination-characteristics; those who practice this way are like empty space"), Master Soku says: "From here down clarifies function. Previously saying 'no knowledge' is not like wood, stone, or the great void. Rather, this is the mind-essence in tranquil extinction without the knowledge of grasping characteristics. Therefore, though without illumination-characteristics, wisdom becomes mysterious and deluded attachments are lost—this is called practicing the way. Being action of no-action, it is like empty space." Regarding "How can there be mind-attainment, etc." (the new version says: "Both minds with attainment and minds without attainment are unattainable"), Master Eki says: "Generally concluding prajñā. Not emerging, therefore unattainable through having mind. Not extinguished, therefore unattainable through no mind."

Sūtra: "Therefore prajñā... to... acting while acting"

The new version says: "Therefore prajñā neither is the five aggregates nor apart from the five aggregates, neither is sentient beings nor apart from sentient beings, neither is sense-realms nor apart from sense-realms, neither is practice-understanding nor apart from practice-understanding. Such characteristics are inconceivable." Master Soku says: "The second concludes the above four meanings."

Sūtra: "Therefore prajñā... to... others also inconceivable"

The new version says: "Therefore all bodhisattva-mahāsattvas' cultivated practices have not yet reached completion, yet they act within them. All buddhas know them to be like phantom transformations, attain non-dwelling characteristics, yet transform within them. Therefore the fourteen tolerances are inconceivable." Master Soku says: "The third doubly concludes the inconceivability of the two treasuries. The text has two parts: first, depending on wisdom to generally conclude; then from 'all bodhisattvas' down (some versions say 'all buddhas and bodhisattvas'), the second separately concludes regarding persons."

Sūtra: "Good sons, this merit... to... King Moonlight's divisions and meanings of merit"

【Page 53 Upper】
The new version says: "Good sons, what you now explain—this merit treasury—has great benefit. Even if there were immeasurable Ganges-sand numbers of tenth-ground bodhisattvas explaining these merits, it would be like one drop in the ocean compared to hundreds of thousands of billions of parts. The buddhas of past, present, and future truly know this; all sages praise it completely. Therefore I say: briefly describing the spoken small portion of merit." Masters Soku and Eki's meaning says: "From 'Good sons' to 'one drop' explains the immeasurable; from 'I now briefly describe' to 'King Moonlight's divisions and meanings' explains 'only Buddha can know.' If following the new version, it's difficult to divide the two texts. Also, the above heading lacks 'immeasurable.' Those who see should think carefully." Regarding "like one drop in the ocean," Master Soku says: "The king's explanation is like the ocean; consecration bodhisattvas are like one drop." Master Zō has two explanations: one follows Master Soku's explanation; another explanation: Moonlight's explanation is like one drop; tenth-ground bodhisattvas' explanation is like the ocean. Master Eki says: "Prajñā is the treasury of all buddhas' merits. How could consecration and Moonlight exhaust it? Therefore what they explain is like one drop in the ocean" (I examine the meaning of old and new sūtras; Master Eki's explanation is good).

Sūtra: "Good sons, these fourteen... to... present body attains reward"

The new version says: "Good sons, these fourteen tolerances are what all bodhisattvas of past and present in the ten directions have practiced, what all buddhas have manifested; future buddhas and bodhisattva-mahāsattvas are also likewise." Master Eki says: "Third, encouraging cultivation." Master Soku says: "The third challenges (the commentary writes 'praises') function to encourage cultivation. There are two benefits: first, transcending various sufferings and difficulties; second, attaining reward in the present body and gaining fruits of sagehood, etc." Regarding faith-tolerance and superior-tolerance (the new version says: "dwelling-tolerance, practice-tolerance, dedication-tolerance, joy-tolerance, stainless-tolerance, radiant-tolerance, blazing-wisdom-tolerance, invincible-tolerance, manifest-tolerance, far-reaching-tolerance, immovable-tolerance, excellent-wisdom-tolerance, dharma-cloud-tolerance, perfect-enlightenment-tolerance").

Sūtra: "At that time, in the assembly... to... pāramitā"

【Page 53 Lower】
The new version says: "At that time, ten billion bodhisattva-mahāsattvas with the same name Ākāśagarbha, together with immeasurable countless great assemblies who had come, rejoiced and leaped. Receiving the Buddha's spiritual power, they universally saw buddhas of the ten directions, numerous as Ganges sands, each in their enlightenment sites explaining the fourteen tolerances, no different from what our World-Honored One explained. Each rejoiced and practiced prajñāpāramitā according to the teaching." Master Eki says: "The third is the assembly's celebration and offerings." Master Soku says: "The third is the great assembly's offerings." Master Zō says: "The great assembly heard the dharma, gained benefit, and scattered flowers in offering." Regarding the ten (the character "ten" is likely superfluous) eighteen brahmās: three each in the three dhyānas, nine in the fourth dhyāna: Merit-born, Merit-loving, Vast-result, Formless, and the five Pure Abodes. I say: "This passage of sūtra text is unclear. The various masters are not detailed. Scholars should contemplate."

Sūtra: "Buddha told the great king... to... such as this" (I cite the sūtra text)

Master Eki says: "From here down, the second separately answers the third question. The text has three parts: first citing the question, second correctly answering, third gaining benefit." Masters Zō and Soku are the same (I say: "Gaining benefit should be contemplated, as before").

Sūtra: "Buddha told the great king, you previously said 'How can sentient beings' characteristics be transformed?'" (The new version says: "You previously asked 'Later, with what characteristics should one dwell in observation?'")

Citing the question.

Sūtra: "If with phantom transformation... to... such as this"

Master Eki says: "The correct answer text has three parts: first brief answer, second from 'sentient beings' consciousness' down extensive answer, third from 'Great king, if bodhisattvas' down concluding answer." Master Soku says: "The text has two parts: first brief answer, then extensive explanation."

Sūtra: "If with phantom transformation... to... transforming sentient beings"

The new version says: "One should observe thus: with phantom transformation body seeing phantom transformation, correctly dwelling in equality without there being self and other."

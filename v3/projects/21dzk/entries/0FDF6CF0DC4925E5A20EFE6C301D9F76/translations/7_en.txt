they do not arise in the same form. They are things that arise differently from before. Therefore, the swiftness of perishing is the same for all conditioned dharmas. The slowness of arising is indefinite according to the thing. There are things that permanently do not arise and cease. There are things that arise slowly. There are things that arise immediately. Sometimes they arise immediately, sometimes they arise slowly. There are also things that are indefinite according to time. In any case, there are things that arise and perish moment by moment in the same way. Ordinary beings, deluded and confused, think they are permanent. In reality, all are impermanent. Both form and mind are thus. Among minds, manas and ālaya consciousness arise without interruption. Mental consciousness, when left alone, does not cease, though there are rare times when it does not arise. The five consciousnesses rarely arise after perishing. Sometimes this is not the case. Each time conditioned dharmas perish like this, leaving behind their vital essence is what we call perfuming seeds. Therefore, all myriad things arise from the respective vital essences within the eighth ālaya consciousness in our own bodies, becoming mind, becoming houses, becoming clothing and food, becoming treasures, becoming heaven and earth, lands, mountains and rivers, and plants and trees.

The seeds of ālaya consciousness are also held within ālaya consciousness. However, ālaya consciousness is the dharma that receives and maintains seeds; it does not perfume seeds. It is mental consciousness and manas consciousness that perfume the seeds of ālaya. The details of this are lengthy, so I abbreviate them. Now, the seeds I am discussing are newly perfumed seeds. Because they are newly perfumed for the first time, they are called newly perfumed seeds. Besides these, there are originally existent seeds. Originally existent seeds are not newly perfumed. Within the eighth ālaya, their vital essence exists as beginningless dharmatā. There are two types: first, contaminated dharmatā seeds; second, uncontaminated dharmatā seeds. In both, there are detailed distinctions of myriad forms and minds. Now these originally existent, newly perfumed, contaminated seeds are all conditioned dharmas, so they arise and perish momentarily. When they perish, each draws forth subsequent seeds. That is to say, form seeds, when they perish, draw only form seeds. Mind seeds, when they perish, draw mind seeds. Among forms there are many forms. Among minds there are many minds. All thus draw their own kind. Therefore, the seeds of various dharmas

never cease. For example, though a swift river's flow passes quickly, it continues flowing without interruption. Therefore, seeds produce manifest activity, manifest activity produces seeds. Seeds also produce seeds. These three conditions are such that the causal substance transforms and becomes the result. Those conditions are most intimate. The causal conditions among the four conditions mentioned earlier are these three causal conditions. There are newly perfumed and originally existent seeds. There are pratyekabuddha seeds. There are śrāvaka seeds. There are bodhisattva seeds. These are called the spiritual lineages of the three vehicles. The possession of these three vehicle lineages differs variously according to the person. Some beings have only Buddha seeds. This lineage becomes neither śrāvaka nor pratyekabuddha but directly becomes Buddha. This is called sudden teaching Mahāyāna. Some beings have only pratyekabuddha seeds. They directly become pratyekabuddhas and enter nirvāṇa without remainder. Some beings have only śrāvaka lineage. These become śrāvakas and enter nirvāṇa without remainder. These two types are called fixed-nature two-vehicle practitioners. Some beings have all three vehicle seeds. These first become śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas and later achieve Buddhahood. These are called gradual-awakening bodhisattvas. Some beings have none of the three vehicle seeds. Such people remain ordinary beings indefinitely. These are called beings without spiritual nature. Nirvāṇa without remainder means that both body and mind completely perish and disappear, never arising anywhere again,

ending permanently like this. This means all conditioned dharmas are completely exhausted and only the true principle of unconditioned, permanent dharma-nature remains. Taking this as something wonderful, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas wish to achieve this state. Since they take cessation as bliss, this is indeed a wonderful fruit. That hearing of the permanent loss of both body and mind seems distressing is because ordinary beings' minds are crude, entangled by afflictions of loving the body and being greedy for the world, thus fearing the bliss of nirvāṇa's tranquil cessation and unconditioned permanence. If my body disappears and the world is permanently severed, that would not be suffering. If that were so, then because the permanent absence of the virtue of benefiting beings would be sorrowful, one should neither become a śrāvaka nor pratyekabuddha. Thinking to become a Buddha would be an excellent aspiration. This is precisely the great bodhi mind. If one knows that reaching the Pure Land bodhi would bring bodily comfort and worldly existence, then showing the desire to reach it is not at all wishing for the Pure Land. This is merely wishing for saṃsāra of birth and death. What would one do by being born? What is born necessarily dies. What would one do by enjoying? Conditioned pleasures necessarily have a time of exhaustion. Because Pure Land bliss differs from worldly pleasures. Because the fruit of bodhi is not a place reached through birth. Therefore, one should think to become a Buddha, not a two-vehicle practitioner, solely for the sake of saving beings.

the mind that commits various sins. Shamelessness (anapatrāpya) is the mind that feels no shame before the world and commits various sins. Those called shameless people are those in whom this shamelessness and moral dread have increased. Faithlessness (āśraddhya) is the impure and turbid mind that, even when seeing and hearing precious and wonderful things, has no acceptance or aspiration. Such people are mostly indolent. Indolence (kausīdya) is the mind that becomes slack and lazy regarding various wholesome activities. Such people are also mostly faithless. Heedlessness (pramāda) is the mind that has no mind to prevent sin and cultivate wholesomeness, and willfully creates sins. Torpor (styāna) is the sunken and drowning mind. Restlessness (auddhatya) is the agitated and disturbed mind. Forgetfulness (muṣitasmṛtitā) is the mind that forgets things. Such people are mostly scattered. Wrong knowledge (asaṃprajanya) is the mind that knows things that should be known incorrectly. Mental distraction (vikṣepa) is the mind that scatters and disturbs the mind. For this reason it is also called the mental factor of distraction. These are the twenty secondary afflictions.

Among these, ignorance and torpor are similar and difficult to distinguish. Ignorance is dark and deluded, but not sunken and drowning. Torpor is not merely dark and deluded, but heavily sunken. Restlessness and distraction are also difficult to distinguish. Restlessness is, for example, when the mind becomes agitated toward one thing. Distraction is when the mind moves here and there in many ways and becomes disturbed. Now these afflictions necessarily have a defiled nature, which is in contrast to wholesome and afflicted-neutral. Unwholesome means evil. Afflicted-neutral means not evil but turbid. These two natures are both impure natures, so they are called dharmas of defiled nature.

Next, the mental factor of sleep (middha) makes the mind dark and narrow, and makes the body not free. When people sleep, it is when this mental factor has arisen. Regret (kaukṛtya) is the mind that regrets all things. For this reason, it is also called the mental factor of remorse. Initial and sustained application (vitarka-vicāra) is the mind that deliberates on all things when trying to speak. Regarding this, when making shallow deliberation it is called initial application, and when making deep deliberation it is called sustained application. These are the four indeterminate factors.

The characteristics of the fifty-one mental factors are roughly like this. Now these fifty-one mental factors are all retinues of mind, so they follow the mind-kings of the eight consciousnesses. Eye consciousness has thirty-four mental factors: namely the five universal, five object-determining, eleven wholesome, among afflictions—greed, hatred, and delusion, and among secondary afflictions—shamelessness, moral shamelessness, faithlessness, indolence, heedlessness, torpor, restlessness, forgetfulness, wrong knowledge, and mental distraction. Ear consciousness through body consciousness are all likewise. Manas consciousness has all fifty-one. Manas consciousness has eighteen mental factors: the five universal, wisdom among the object-determining, greed, pride, ignorance, and self-view among the afflictions, and faithlessness, indolence, heedlessness, torpor, restlessness, forgetfulness, wrong knowledge, and mental distraction among the secondary afflictions. Ālaya consciousness has only the five universal.

Among these, when afflictions and secondary afflictions arise, the corresponding mind-king, the universal factors, any object-determining factors if present, and any indeterminate factors if present are all completely defiled in nature. When wholesome mental factors arise, all these dharmas are wholesome in nature. Afflictions and secondary afflictions do not arise. When afflictions and secondary afflictions arise, wholesome mental factors do not arise. When neutral, all these dharmas are neutral. Regarding the eight consciousnesses, eye consciousness through these six sometimes are wholesome, sometimes defiled, sometimes neutral. Their nature is indeterminate, being either way depending on the time. Manas consciousness is always defiled in nature. Ālaya consciousness is always neutral in nature. Their respective corresponding mental factors are also likewise.

One complete set with mind-king and mental factors is called "one cluster." One cluster means one village. Therefore the eight consciousnesses are the minds of eight villages. It is like eight masters each having their retinues in eight villages. Therefore the mind-king and mental factors within one village are necessarily of the same nature—if wholesome, all are wholesome; if defiled, all are defiled; if neutral, all are neutral. Among these, the five consciousnesses and the eighth consciousness are minds that know things just as they are. Manas consciousness is always a biased mind. Manas consciousness sometimes knows things as they are and sometimes is biased. The state of the mind-kings of the eight consciousnesses and the fifty-one mental factors is generally like this.

Next, saying there are eleven form dharmas—their names are also in the Hundred Dharmas Treatise. Among them, eye-faculty, ear-faculty, nose-faculty, tongue-faculty, and body-faculty are called the five faculties. These are the supporting faculties for eye consciousness through body consciousness mentioned earlier. Supporting faculty means that when mind knows objects, it uses this as power to be able to know. For example, using a luminous jewel to illuminate objects so as to be able to see them. The five faculties are like jewels, and the mind's knowing objects is like being able to see. The objects of knowledge are like the objects of sight. Eye consciousness, ear consciousness, etc., and eye-faculty, ear-faculty, etc., are separate dharmas. Consciousness refers to mind dharmas. Faculty refers to form dharmas. These faculties are what are called a person's actual eyes, actual ears, actual nose, actual tongue, actual body. The eyes, ears, etc. that are currently visibly apparent are called "supporting faculties." They are of the same type as form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. They are not the true eyes, ears, etc. The actual eyes, ears, etc. exist at the base of the visibly apparent eyes, ears, etc. as pure and subtle jewel-like things. These are called "proper faculties." The present five faculties are these.

Next, form, sound, smell, taste, and touch are also called the five dusts and also called the five objects. They are what those five consciousnesses know through the five faculties. Namely, eye consciousness knows form through dependence on the eye-faculty. Form refers to the colors blue, yellow, red, and white. Ear consciousness knows sound through dependence on the ear-faculty. And so forth—body consciousness knows touch through the body. One should understand by arranging them in sequence like this. Next, "form included in the dharma-source" refers to form dharmas within the sixth consciousness's knowing the affairs of the boundless dharma realm.

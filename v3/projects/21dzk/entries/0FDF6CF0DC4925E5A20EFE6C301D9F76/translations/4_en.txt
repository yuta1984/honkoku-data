[there are form dharmas]. Usually we call blue, yellow, red, and white "form" (rūpa), but in the dharma teachings, sound, smell, taste, and touch are all called "form." Among these, blue, yellow, red, and white have the meaning of form clearly manifest, so they are called "manifest form." Sound, smell, taste, and touch have the meaning of form still concealed, so separate names are established for each. Now among these mind-kings, mental factors, and form dharmas, there are real dharmas and provisional dharmas. Since they are conditioned dharmas like illusions, they are temporary functions and characteristics, but even within the temporary, there are multiple levels of functions and characteristics. Therefore, dharmas that have their own seeds are considered real dharmas. Those that are distinguished and separated from these real dharmas but have no separate essence are provisional dharmas. Provisional dharmas and non-existent dharmas are different. Things that are completely non-existent are called non-existent dharmas. Things that are neither truly existent nor completely non-existent, but are provisionally tainted, are called provisional dharmas. The imagined nature (parikalpita) mentioned earlier is indeed non-existent dharma. The provisional dharmas mentioned now are dharmas revealed within the other-dependent nature, so they are not non-existent dharmas.

Next, the twenty-four non-associated factors are also the twenty-four listed in the Hundred Dharmas Treatise. These are all provisional dharmas. The reason these twenty-four are called "non-associated" is that there is a dharma teaching called the five aggregates: form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. Among these five, the fourth aggregate of mental formations includes various mental factors as well as dharmas such as acquisition, life faculty, and common characteristics of sentient beings. Among these, mental factors are said to be "associated" with the mind-king, which means they intimately correspond and align with it. These twenty-four factors like "acquisition" do not associate with the mind-king, hence they are called "non-associated." Therefore, specifically they are called "dharmas of mental formations not associated with mind." These twenty-four are neither mind nor form, but are conceptual divisions that exist in relation to form dharmas and mind dharmas. They have no separate essence. Therefore, all twenty-four are provisional dharmas.

Briefly, "acquisition" (prāpti) refers to when a person is said to have acquired something—neither the acquired gold, silver, etc. is the true acquisition, nor is the person who acquires it true acquisition, nor is the person who gives it acquisition. When both the acquirer and the acquired object already exist, is there really such a thing as "acquisition" between them? Therefore, this is a provisional dharma. Life faculty (jīvitendriya) is life. There is no separate essence called "life." It is merely the function that maintains body and mind during one lifetime. The remaining factors like common characteristics of sentient beings and ordinary being nature are all similar matters.

Starting with human bodies and human minds, horses, cattle, ants, locusts, food, clothing, houses, fields, gardens, mountains, rivers, stones, tiles, gold, silver, sun, moon, stars, clouds, mist, rain, and earth—not limited to these, when we examine the essence of all various things, there is not a single thing separate from the eight consciousness mind-kings, fifty-one mental factors, and eleven form dharmas. The twenty-four non-associated factors are established upon these. Things have various names. Things have various numbers. These too are non-associated factors. The four directions, four corners, four seasons, and twelve hours are all these non-associated factors. There is no separate essence whatsoever. One should carefully consider this. The nature of the ninety-four dharmas of other-dependent nature is roughly like this.

Next, saying there are six in the perfect realized nature refers to the six unconditioned dharmas. The six names are also as in the Hundred Dharmas Treatise. These six have an essence that is eternal and are not created by others. "Being created" means the meaning of being made. "Others" refers to conditions. Among various conditions there are four: causal conditions, immediately preceding conditions, object conditions, and predominant conditions. Causal conditions refer to seeds conditioning the manifest, and manifest immediately conditioning seeds, and manifest conditioning seeds. This condition is the most intimate among conditions. The essence of the cause immediately becomes the result. The details of this will be explained later regarding seeds. Immediately preceding conditions refer to when a mind arises and then ceases, it gives rise to the next mind. The later mind is born taking the previous mind as condition. Object conditions refer to the objects that mind knows. Mind is born taking the objects it knows as conditions. Predominant conditions refer to the conditions of all other various things. Body takes mind as condition, self takes others as condition, others take self as condition, sentient beings take insentient things as condition. Among insentient things, houses, mountains, seas, plants, etc. take the great earth as condition. The great earth takes the three wheels as condition. Within houses, rafters, beams, walls, pillars—various things mutually serve as conditions for each other. Among mountains, seas, plants, etc., wind, rain, water, stones, roots, stems, branches, leaves, flowers, fruits—various things mutually serve as conditions for each other, and even human limbs and the five parts of the body—myriad things mutually serving as conditions is immeasurable and boundless. Such conditions are all predominant conditions.

Such dharmas are all impermanent. The subtle principle of eternally abiding suchness is not created by such four conditions. Therefore it is called "unconditioned." However, suchness is of one taste and equality. In reality there are not six separate essences, but based on positions and conceptual characteristics, the six unconditioned are distinguished. The absence of various obstructions resembles space, hence it is called "unconditioned space." Through the power of analytical wisdom, various defilements are extinguished and ultimately realized, hence it is called "analytical cessation unconditioned." Analytical wisdom refers to wisdom. Defilements refer to afflictions. Realization means to clearly know. Also, even without relying on the analysis of wisdom, the essence of suchness is originally pure. Or when conditions are lacking, the principle of non-arising naturally manifests. These are called "non-analytical cessation unconditioned." When conditions are lacking and there is natural non-arising means that when something should arise but its conditions are lacking, it naturally does not arise. Also, the unconditioned that manifests when painful sensations and pleasant sensations cease is called "immovable unconditioned." Painful sensation means receiving suffering in the body. Pleasant sensation means the mind that receives pleasure in the body. These two are what was mentioned before

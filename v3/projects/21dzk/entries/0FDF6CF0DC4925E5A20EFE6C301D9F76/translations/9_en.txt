However, they are not within what ālaya consciousness knows. Regarding this, in the uncontaminated there are what are called three grades of the uncontaminated. The three grades are: lower grade, middle grade, and upper grade. The lower grade is the path of seeing. The path of seeing is when uncontaminated wisdom first arises and cuts off coarse obstructions. The middle grade is the path of cultivation. The path of cultivation is when uncontaminated wisdom repeatedly arises further and cuts off subtle obstructions. The upper grade is Buddhahood. This is the stage where all obstructions are completely severed and awakening reaches its culmination. These three are called the three grades of the uncontaminated. The way these various uncontaminated seeds mentioned above are distributed among these three grades is as follows: In the lower grade seeds are the seeds of the Wisdom of Wonderful Observation and the Wisdom of Equality—all are contained within this. There are no other seeds. The middle grade seeds are also likewise. In the lower and middle grades, the two wisdoms of wonderful observation and equality each have twenty-one dharmas. In the Wisdom of Wonderful Observation, besides the twenty-one, there are the mental factor of investigation (vitarka) and the mental factor of analysis (vicāra). Therefore, in total there are twenty-three. In the upper grade seeds, there are seeds of the four wisdoms. Mental factors in each case are all twenty-one. This is because in Buddhahood there are no investigation and analysis. There are also seeds of the five sense faculties and five sense objects. The Tathāgata's thirty-two major marks and eighty minor marks, countless great luminosity, boundless pure lands, etc., are all completely contained within this. This is because the uncontaminated form, sound, smell, taste, and touch are inseparable. Therefore, the appearance of dark blue crown and golden body, the adornment of vermillion lips and blue lotus, the structure of flower platforms and jeweled pavilions, the eight meritorious waters and seven-tiered

adornments—all exist within my own mind. How much more so the pure and immeasurably subtle merits that are inherently complete! My body is precisely Buddha. This place is precisely the Pure Land. Contemplation is also without contradiction. However, I cannot use my own mind. The delusion of ignorance is as dark as darkness, and the grasping of satkāya-dṛṣṭi is as hard as stone. Even though it is called contemplation, it is not clear and does not last long. It is like walking with a dim lamp in fierce winds of deep darkness. It is extinguished in an instant, dim and clumsy. How much more so for those who close their eyes to Buddhist teaching and are born in border regions. How much more so for sentient beings in hell, as hungry ghosts, and as animals. Therefore, the seeds of supreme great awakening sink and are buried in vain, unable to produce manifest activity. It is like sandalwood seeds being in the soil, buried in various foul and defiled things, not yet having sprouted forth. However, for those whose roots have matured and whose time has come, who are bodhisattvas wishing to become Buddha for the sake of sentient beings, the mind to benefit sentient beings arises strongly, and sleeping or waking there is no time of slackness. Since it remains unmoved through life after life, whether one opens and examines the teachings oneself or listens to others' explanations, those three grades of uncontaminated seeds gradually become moistened and sprout. It is like sandalwood seeds when the time for sprouting approaches favorably and they receive the moisture of rain and dew. In this way, as that mind becomes deep and firm, through learning the teachings

and cultivating practices, the stages of wisdom progressively advance, the virtue of compassion gradually accumulates, and after one great immeasurable kalpa, the awakening within ordinary beings' capacity reaches its limit here. Among the uncontaminated seeds that are all moistened, the lower grade uncontaminated is about to arise. However, it has not yet arisen. From first arousing firm bodhicitta up to reaching this stage, one is called a pre-ground bodhisattva. This is because one has not yet reached the ten grounds. During this one great immeasurable kalpa, the successive deepening of awakening is called the thirty minds. Namely, the ten stages of dwelling, ten stages of practice, and ten stages of dedication of merit. At the end of the tenth dedication of merit among these, the stage of preparatory practices is established. It is also called the four wholesome roots: the wholesome root of warmth, the wholesome root of peak, the wholesome root of forbearance, and the supreme mundane dharma. These four stages are called: the concentration of increasing clarity, the concentration of attaining clarity, the concentration of accordance with marks, and the uninterrupted concentration. All thirty minds other than these are called the stage of provisions. It is called provisions because one accumulates provisions for the Buddha path. The end becomes specifically the expedient means for the path of seeing, therefore it is called preparatory practice. Now in this pre-ground stage, one subdues many obstructions. What are called obstructions are afflictive obstructions and cognitive obstructions. The nature of afflictions was explained earlier. Secondary afflictions are also included in this. What are called cognitive obstructions are minds that are deluded about the essence at the foundation of each of those afflictive dharmas. Though they are said to be obstructions more difficult to sever than afflictions, they do not have a separate essence outside of afflictions.

[Left page, lower section]
They are simply the deeply subtle aspects at the foundation of afflictions that are called cognitive obstructions. For example, when one sees a stump at night and thinks it is a person, there are two layers: the mind that does not know it is a stump and the mind that thinks it is a person. However, outside the mind that thinks it is a person, there is no not-knowing that it is a stump. There are simply two layers: delusion about function and delusion about essence. The two obstructions of afflictive and cognitive are also like this. Afflictive obstructions are like thinking it is a person. Cognitive obstructions are like not knowing it is a stump. Greed also has these two layers. Hatred also has these two layers. Even in the twenty secondary afflictions, each one is likewise. Among these afflictions, there are coarse types and subtle types. The coarse are called discriminated afflictions. The cognitive obstructions at their foundation are called discriminated cognitive obstructions. The subtle are called innate afflictions. The cognitive obstructions at their foundation are called innate cognitive obstructions. Now the innate two obstructions are severed in the path of cultivation. What is called severing means that when uncontaminated awakening opens, the seeds of afflictive and cognitive obstructions permanently perish and are lost. What is called subduing means that one has not yet reached the point of losing those seeds. Though the seeds still exist, by the power of wisdom, manifest activities do not arise. Now when it is said that pre-ground bodhisattvas subdue many obstructions, it means: the discriminated two obstructions are gradually subdued beginning in the stage of provisions and completely subdued in the stage of preparatory practices. The innate two obstructions begin to be gradually subdued in the stage of preparatory practices, but are not yet completely subdued in the pre-ground stage. On the ground

In the pure land called Mahēśvara Palace, sitting upon the seat of the Great Jeweled Lotus King that extends across ten asaṃkhyeya hundred thousand trichiliocosms, one enters the concentration called Diamond-like Samādhi and severs the Buddha-fruit obstructions mentioned earlier. This time is called the bodhisattva of Equal Enlightenment. The ceremony of consecration and empowerment exists at this stage. When the Buddha-fruit obstructions are thus quickly severed, one swiftly enters the ultimate path. At this time, all contaminated and inferior uncontaminated dharmas perish and are lost. This is when the four wisdoms all manifest from the aforementioned superior-grade naturally uncontaminated seeds that have existed since beginningless time, and myriad virtues become perfectly complete. This is called Buddha. In general, even in the causal stages, whether mind or form, uncontaminated dharmas are all good in nature. This is unlike contaminated dharmas where the three natures intermix. Having achieved Buddhahood, that body pervades the dharma realm. Each of the various major and minor marks is limitless. This is because it corresponds to the limitless good roots cultivated during the long kalpas of the three asaṃkhyeyas. The principle of cause and effect is inevitable—when causes are limitless, effects are also limitless. From this point onward, there is no new perfuming of seeds. Only the superior-grade naturally uncontaminated seeds from beginningless time, and both the original and newly perfumed seeds of lower and middle-grade uncontaminated dharmas, all transform to become superior-grade and exist in the immaculate consciousness. What is called immaculate consciousness is the mind-king corresponding to the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom. That is, from ordinary beings to the seventh ground,

this is called the ālaya consciousness. Up to Equal Enlightenment, this is called the ālaya consciousness of maturation, and when one becomes Buddha, it is called immaculate consciousness. Immaculate consciousness is called amalā consciousness in Sanskrit. This is the eighth consciousness among the eight consciousnesses. In general, the eighth consciousness has various names. Ādāna consciousness is also a name for this consciousness. Therefore, even after becoming Buddha, the eight consciousnesses exist. There are twenty-one mental factors for each. As mentioned earlier. Now, each of these mind-kings and mental factors has four aspects. Within their characteristics, there are five sense faculties and five objects in the mind. Among the five objects are the Tathāgata's major and minor marks, adornments, great radiance, etc. Among these dharmas, those that exist as real dharmas each have seeds. Those seeds are all contained and held within the Tathāgata's immaculate consciousness, and when they arise, they arise from each of those individual seeds. Since they arise, they also necessarily cease. Seeds arise and cease moment by moment, and manifest activities also arise and cease moment by moment. This is because they are created by various conditions. Since they are the products of various conditions, even the Buddha's body is called conditioned. Though called conditioned, it is free from two kinds of birth and death. The two kinds of birth and death are: birth and death by segments, and birth and death by transformation. Birth and death by segments is the birth and death we cycle through. The body is short, and its life necessarily has limits—though one wishes it to be long, this is a reward that cannot be fulfilled. Birth and death by transformation is what bodhisattvas experience.

If they wish to live long, they can live as long as they wish, and their life has no fixed limit. However, when they become Buddha and abandon that body, the Buddha has permanently left the two kinds of birth and death. Birth is not the birth of birth and death. The birth of birth and death necessarily means being born in the three realms through the power of karma. The birth of the Buddha's body means calling the arising of conditioned uncontaminated dharmas "birth." This is because it is not the meaning of being born in the three realms. Cessation is also not the death of birth and death. The death of birth and death means the ending of life when karmic power is exhausted. The cessation of the Buddha's body is the momentary cessation of conditioned uncontaminated dharmas. This is because the Buddha's life never has a time of exhaustion. It is simply the momentary arising and ceasing of the subtle dharma essence. Therefore, it is called the Buddha body that has departed from birth and death. If one says there is birth but no cessation, there is no such principle. This is called the conditioned reward Buddha. This conditioned reward Buddha of major and minor marks and adornments that pervades the dharma realm is now called the self-enjoyment body. Since this is already a Buddha who has appeared for the sake of sentient beings, the work of benefiting sentient beings never ceases even for a moment. Therefore, ordinary beings, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, pre-ground bodhisattvas, ten-ground bodhisattvas, and those of Equal Enlightenment are all liberated. However, even bodhisattvas of Equal Enlightenment cannot see the true form that pervades the dharma realm. How much less can bodhisattvas and śrāvakas who do not reach that level! How much less our kind! Therefore, in order to be seen by people, various forms are manifested. Among them, what appears for our sake is

the sixteen-foot Buddha. This takes one caturmahārājika as its buddha-field. Bodhisattvas of the provisions stage, śrāvakas, and pratyekabuddhas all see this same Buddha. This is called the lesser transformation body. The form that appears for bodhisattvas of the preparatory stage—though we cannot see exactly how tall it is—since it is said to take the trichiliocosm as its buddha-field, it must appear extraordinarily large. This is also called the greater transformation body. For first-ground bodhisattvas, using as a seat a lotus of one hundred petals where each petal extends across a trichiliocosm, a Buddha appears in a form befitting that seat. For the second ground, a thousand-petal lotus serves as the seat. For the third ground, a ten-thousand-petal lotus serves as the seat. Up to the tenth ground, an ineffably ineffable lotus serves as the seat. Since the form befits each seat, the successive excellence must indeed be so. The ten levels of Buddha bodies are called other-enjoyment bodies. Those buddha-fields are all pure lands. Their vastness gradually increases like the flower seats. Therefore, from the first ground to the tenth ground, there are ten levels of pure lands. The Pure Land of Bliss is seen as the buddha-field when Amitābha appears for first-ground bodhisattvas. The nature of such dharmas is suchness. The uncontaminated wisdom thus provided within the self-enjoyment body is well merged with suchness. This

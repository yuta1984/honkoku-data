[continues the explanation]. The mental factor of volition (cetanā) is the mind that creates and accomplishes mind as wholesome, unwholesome, or neutral. These are called the five universal factors.

Next, the mental factor of desire (chanda) is the mind that wishes for wholesome, unwholesome, or neutral things. The mental factor of determination (adhimokṣa) is the mind that firmly resolves upon anything. The mental factor of mindfulness (smṛti) is the mind that clearly records past events in the mind and does not forget them. The mental factor of samādhi is the mind that fixes the mind on whatever it wishes to know and prevents it from scattering. This is also called the mental factor of concentration. Next, the mental factor of wisdom (prajñā) is the mind that skillfully examines and discerns the merits and faults of all things one wishes to know, and eliminates doubt. This is wisdom itself. These are called the five object-determining factors.

These ten are sometimes wholesome, sometimes unwholesome, sometimes neutral. Though their nature is indeterminate, they necessarily exist in all minds. The object-determining factors necessarily exist in sentient beings of the three realms. Therefore they are not called indeterminate mental factors.

Next, the mental factor of faith (śraddhā) is what is commonly called arising faith in the world. It is the mind that deeply accepts and wishes for precious and wonderful things with clear purity. The mental factor of diligence (vīrya) is the mind that is courageous and pure in cultivating wholesomeness. The mental factor of shame (hrī) is the mind that feels shame toward oneself and toward dharma, and does not commit various sins. The mental factor of moral dread (apatrāpya) is not committing various sins out of shame before the world. The mental factor of non-greed (alobha) is the mind free from coveting various things.

The mental factor of non-hatred (adoṣa) is the mind that does not become angry even when others oppose one. The mental factor of non-delusion (amoha) is the mind that is clear about the principles of all things and has no foolishness. The mental factor of tranquility (praśrabdhi) is the joyful mind that feels both body and mind at ease. This mental factor does not arise in ordinary times but arises when one enters concentration. The mental factor of non-heedlessness (apramāda) is the mind that prevents sin and cultivates wholesomeness. Those who constantly commit sins willfully are called heedless people. This is the opposite—the mind that particularly fears and avoids sin and wishes to create merit. The mental factor of equanimity (upekṣā) is the mind that makes the mind equal and upright. The mental factor of non-harming (ahiṃsā) is the mind that pities people. Loving-kindness and compassion refer to non-hatred and non-harming. Non-hatred is loving-kindness; non-harming is compassion. These are the eleven wholesome factors. Whenever anyone's wholesome mind arises, these ten necessarily all arise. For those who have attained concentration, tranquility also arises, so all eleven arise.

Next, greed (lobha) is the mind that covets all things. Hatred (dveṣa) is the mind that necessarily becomes angry when others oppose one. Pride (māna) is the mind that relies on oneself and despises others. Ignorance (avidyā) is also called delusion—the mind that is dark regarding the principles of all things. Doubt (vicikitsā) is the mind that cannot determine the principles of anything and doubts. Wrong view (mithyādṛṣṭi) is the mind that strongly determines on wrong things and does not know true principles. In the treatises it is called evil view. These are the six afflictions.

The way to expand these to ten is that within wrong views, there are five views that are distinguished. First is personality view (satkāyadṛṣṭi), which is self-grasping. It is the mind that strictly separates "my body" and "others' bodies," "my things" and "others' things." Second is extreme view (antagrāhadṛṣṭi), also abbreviated as "extreme view." It is the mind that thinks one's body will exist forever, or thinks that after death the self will be permanently lost. Third is wrong view—the mind that thinks there is no such thing as sin, no such thing as merit, no retribution of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals, and no retribution of human realm, heaven, pure land, or enlightenment. This is the mind that slanders the Three Jewels. Fourth is view-attachment (dṛṣṭiparāmarśa), abbreviated as "view-attachment." It is the mind that thinks these wrong-grasping minds are wonderful minds, or thinks people who speak wrong things are admirable. Fifth is attachment to rules and vows (śīlavrataparāmarśa), abbreviated as "precept-attachment." This is thinking the precepts established by non-Buddhists are excellent prohibitive precepts, or revering those who teach such precepts, keeping those precepts and vainly tormenting the body. What are called non-Buddhist austerities in the world are this. When thus expanded, they become the ten afflictions.

Next, fury (krodha) is the mind that becomes so angry as to want to take up a stick and beat people. Resentment (upanāha) is the mind that bears grudges against people. People who suffer from resentment cannot endure and forbear, and their minds are constantly troubled. Vexation (pradāsa) is the mind that becomes angry and resentful toward people, becoming twisted and contrary, with the mind constantly uneasy, treacherous, base, and violent—dark and poisonous. Concealment (mrakṣa) is the mind that fears losing fame and profit and hides the sins one commits. Those who hide sins necessarily later regret and grieve. Deceit (māyā) is the false mind that, in order to gain fame and profit, devises different schemes in the mind and craftily displays having virtue. Those called deceitful and deluding in the world are people in whom this mind has increased. Flattery (śāṭhya) is the mind that, in order to delude and confuse people, follows circumstances and responds to situations, craftily devising expedients to capture people's minds, or hiding one's own faults. Those called flattering and crooked in the world are people in whom this mind has increased. Arrogance (mada) is the mind that thinks of oneself as wonderful and becomes proud and haughty. Harmfulness (vihiṃsā) is the merciless mind without a mind that pities people. Those called to have no compassionate nature in the world are people in whom this mind has increased. Jealousy (īrṣyā) is the uneasy mind that, because one seeks fame and profit for oneself, deeply thinks it enviable when seeing and hearing of others' prosperity. Stinginess (mātsarya) is the mind that is attached to wealth and treasures, has no mind to give to others, and only thinks of accumulating more and more. Those called stingy and greedy are people in whom this mind has increased. Shamelessness (āhrīkya) is not being ashamed even of oneself, making light of wholesome roots, and

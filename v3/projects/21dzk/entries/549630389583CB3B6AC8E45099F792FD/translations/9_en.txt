Let us set this aside for now. Looking at the texts that clarify bodhisattva practice, supreme enlightenment (anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi) is extremely difficult to attain. Without many vows and practices, there is no way to accomplish it. It is said that bodhisattvas must necessarily pass through three incalculable kalpas, cultivating the provisions of great merit and wisdom, the six pāramitās, and many hundreds of thousands of ascetic practices to attain supreme perfect enlightenment. The characteristics of difficult and arduous practice are beyond reach. Generally, this treatise collection investigates the nature and characteristics of all phenomena and makes judgments on the doctrinal gates of Buddhism. If one does not cultivate the path of the three vehicles as taught, one cannot quickly escape birth and death, but if one studies well, one should know the causes and effects of worldly and transcendent matters and develop wisdom. If one develops wisdom, it should become the seed of the understanding cause. However, learning is also not easy, and the benefits are also long and distant. This clarifies the gate of existence within Hīnayāna. Among the thirty fascicles, the first two clarify the elements (dhātu). Elements refer to the eighteen elements, etc. The next five clarify the faculties. Faculties refer to the six faculties, etc. The next five clarify the world. World refers to the world of sentient beings and the vessel world. The next six clarify karma. Karma refers to the karmic causes of good and evil.

The next three clarify the latent afflictions (anuśaya). Latent afflictions refer to the defilements. The next four clarify the worthy and noble. The worthy and noble refer to the path-positions of the seven worthy and seven noble ones. The next two clarify wisdom. Wisdom refers to the ten wisdoms, etc. The next two clarify concentration. Concentration refers to samādhi such as samāpatti and samādhi. The last fascicle clarifies the profound principle of destroying the self. This destroys the attachment to self of non-Buddhist schools.

First, the Satyasiddhi school, like Abhidharma, clarifies the path-positions of the three vehicles. However, regarding śrāvakas, Abhidharma judges the positions of seven worthy and seven noble ones. The Satyasiddhi Treatise establishes twenty-seven positions of worthy and noble ones. The twenty-seven worthy and noble ones consist of eighteen learners and nine non-learners. This treatise clarifies the gate of emptiness within Hīnayāna. This school appears to have already ceased being studied at present. How much less are there people of cultivation and realization—there are none at all. The above is a brief outline of the main ideas of the eight schools.

First, the Buddha-mind school refers to Bodhidharma's words: "A special transmission outside the teachings, not establishing letters, directly pointing to the human mind, seeing nature and becoming Buddha."

This is its sectarian principle. Though doctrinal schools speak of the inconceivable, what is shown through words and phrases is not inconceivable. Though they contemplate reality, if they do not separate from good and evil discrimination, they do not accord with enlightened understanding. The Buddha-patriarchs do not explain this through words but clarify the source depths of what is transmitted from mind to mind. Therefore, one cannot borrow letters to explain its meaning. It is simply a path to be attained through practice in the mind-ground. Not seeing a single thing is called the path of seeing; not practicing a single thing is called the path of practice. Simply guarding one's original face and manifesting one's fundamental role. This is what is meant by "do not think about all good and evil." This is precisely the mind that does not take conditions as objects and is non-abiding and empty-quiescent. Understanding the meaning of this mind's non-nature and non-abiding is called intellectual awakening. Through practice based on this understanding, forgetting the discriminations of that mind, the principle of empty quiescence manifesting is called realization-awakening. That one thought-moment of true realization-awakening is called seeing nature and becoming Buddha. Merely understanding principles intellectually and thinking one has reached the end, not seeking realization beyond this,

is called pride of superiority, which the patriarchs have deeply warned against. This position of understanding is, among the three wisdoms of hearing, thinking, and cultivating established in doctrinal schools, the position of hearing and thinking. Knowing meaning through text is called hearing-wisdom; contemplating based on meaning is called thinking-wisdom; forgetting conditions and quieting illumination is called cultivation-wisdom. This cultivation-wisdom is taken as the position that accords with realization. In the Zen school, this position of hearing and thinking, though having shallow and deep levels, is called one intellectual awakening, and the position of cultivation-wisdom is called realization-awakening. When patriarchs attain this realization-awakening and encounter seeing, hearing, feeling, and knowing, they separate from attachments in their minds, forget discriminations, and what manifests in the mind of the true character of dharma is opened and shown according to the recipient's capacity—this is called a koan. People whose conditions correspond may hear and immediately have understanding. If the mind does not have understanding and one learns the essential subtle words of ancient masters and explains them, both explanation and listening are not the original intent of the Zen gate. Therefore, there is no need to explain through words. Those with aspiration should know through practice. Responding to words while forgetting words, responding to characteristics while

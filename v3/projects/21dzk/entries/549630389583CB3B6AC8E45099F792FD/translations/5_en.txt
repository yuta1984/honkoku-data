"do not contradict" refers to the characteristics of this stage. When assigned to the fifty-two stages, this is the stage of the ten faiths. This is the inner ordinary person. Having not yet reached the stage of realization, but developing the wisdom of similarity, it is called "approximate identity." Partial-true identity means the stage of eliminating ignorance and realizing the middle way. This consists of the forty-one stages: ten abodes, ten practices, ten dedications, ten grounds, and near-perfect enlightenment. At each stage, one eliminates one grade of ignorance and manifests one portion of the principle of the middle way. This is the stage of realization. Having not yet reached the ultimate supreme stage, but partially realizing the true principle of dharma-nature, the name "partial-true" is established. Ultimate identity means the stage of wondrous enlightenment. One eliminates the fundamental ignorance and realizes the ultimate middle way. There is no stage above this to reach, no virtue above this to realize. Therefore it is called "ultimate identity." When discussing the path of cultivation and entry in terms of doctrinal categories, there are these sequential stages of the six identities. However, when speaking of instantaneous realization in one thought-moment with the spirit of the contemplative path, one does not necessarily progress through these stages one by one. The three thousand dharmas mentioned above, whether in sentient beings or in buddha-fruition,

【Page 10, Lower Section】
have the same essence. It is only through the difference between delusion and enlightenment that the dharmas of defilement and purity differ, but if one traces their nature, they are equal without difference. In the sixth volume of the Shijian it says: "When the three thousand exist in principle, they are uniformly called ignorance. When the three thousand achieve fruition, they are all called constant bliss. Since the three thousand do not change, ignorance is precisely illumination." This is that meaning. Therefore, because ignorance is precisely illumination, one realizes that afflictions are precisely enlightenment, and because afflictions are precisely enlightenment, knowing that sentient beings are precisely buddhas is called "original buddhahood." Understanding the meaning of original buddhahood is also called "becoming buddha in this very body." If one truly accords with this principle, attaining realization should be as easy as turning over one's palm. However, because sentient beings have been covered by worldly troubles for a long time since beginningless time, it is difficult to practice the contemplation of true reality and difficult to manifest the inherent buddha-nature. For this reason, even in this school, beautifully achieving buddhahood in this very body is rare. Attaining the stage of purification of the six sense faculties in one lifetime is considered a swift benefit. The Shu-

【Page 11, Upper Section】
ji, seventh volume, says "For the extremely slow [in purifying] the six sense faculties, they do not emerge within three lifetimes." Therefore, it appears that those of superior capacity reach this stage in the present life, while those of dull capacity should reach this stage in two or three lifetimes. The stage of purification of the six sense faculties is the fourth stage among the six identities—the stage of approximate identity. The Great Master Nanyue reached this stage, while the Great Master Tiantai had not yet reached this stage and remained at the stage of the five grades of contemplative practice. For ordinary beings of thin spiritual capacity, easily advancing to higher stages is difficult. One should understand this. Therefore, rather than striving to concentrate on the difficult contemplation of the three truths and seeking the hard-to-attain realization in the present body, it would be better to practice the easy-to-perform nembutsu and aspire to be born in the easy-to-reach Pure Land—this would be the determined mindset for liberation and the direct path to swift liberation. A questioner asks: "Even if one cannot achieve the contemplation of the perfect interpenetration of the three truths and attain the enlightenment of buddhahood in this very body, simply receiving, maintaining, and reciting the Lotus Sutra to achieve buddhahood—why should this not be possible for any being of even the lowest capacity? The sutra text says, for instance:

【Page 11, Lower Section】
'After my extinction, one should receive and maintain this sutra. Such a person, regarding the buddha-way, will definitely have no doubts,' and also says 'If there are those who hear the Dharma, not one will fail to become buddha.' Therefore, if one practices according to this sutra, wouldn't obtaining swift benefits not be difficult?" The answer is: "Indeed, receiving, maintaining, and reciting the Lotus Sutra brings immense merit. Its benefits cannot be empty. However, according to Tiantai's understanding, the fundamental approach is to make contemplative understanding of principle the foundation, and then add the cultivation of practices on top of that. When the sutra explains 'practice according to the teaching,' it manifests the meaning of the completeness of understanding and practice. Merely reciting the written words may become a distant cause, but it is difficult to determine as a direct cause of buddhahood. Therefore, Vasubandhu Bodhisattva's Commentary on the Lotus says: 'Those who generate the bodhi-mind and practice the bodhisattva path—the good roots they create can realize enlightenment. This is not something that ordinary people and determined śrāvakas who have not originally generated the bodhi-mind can obtain.' Generating the bodhi-mind and practicing the bodhisattva path refers to understanding and practice. Ordinary people who do not arouse the bodhi-mind of the perfect interpenetration of the three truths, even if they cultivate good roots to some extent, find it difficult to attain enlightenment, as can be seen

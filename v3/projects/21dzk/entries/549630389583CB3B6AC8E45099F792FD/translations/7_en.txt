they are not elsewhere. They simply dwell manifestly in the minds of all sentient beings. However, sentient beings are obstructed by delusions and hindrances and do not know this principle. When one cultivates the contemplative practices of the three mysteries, through the power of that contemplative practice, one manifests the inherent Buddha-nature—this is what the teaching explains. One recites mantras with the mouth, forms mudrās with the hands, and creates visualizations with the mind, thus the three karmas correspond. In the Lotus Samādhi Sutra, there is a profound and clear passage: "Taking refuge in the original enlightened mind, the Dharma body eternally abides, the wondrous dharma mind-lotus platform, originally complete with the merits of the three bodies, the thirty-seven honored ones dwell in the mind-citadel." The meaning is that the original enlightened mind-Dharma body constantly sits on the wondrous dharma mind-lotus platform, and the thirty-seven honored ones dwell in our mind-citadel. The mind-Dharma body refers to the mind-nature of sentient beings. This is also the wondrous dharma. This is also the mind-citadel. The eight-part flesh mass within the chest is likened to the eight-petaled lotus platform. This is called the mind-lotus platform. Above this mind-lotus platform is the mind-Dharma body. This mind-Dharma body is complete with the merits of the three bodies, and the thirty-seven honored ones also dwell there. The thirty-seven honored ones are: Mahāvairocana Tathāgata, the four Buddhas and four pāramitās, the sixteen great bodhisattvas, and the eight offering and four embracing bodhisattvas. Listing their names one by one, Mahāvairocana Tathāgata

resides in the center. When assigned to the five wisdoms, it is the wisdom of the essential nature of the dharma realm. Akṣobhya Buddha resides in the east and represents the great mirror wisdom. Ratnasambhava Buddha resides in the south and represents the wisdom of equality. Amitābha Buddha resides in the west and represents the wisdom of wondrous observation. Amoghasiddhi Buddha resides in the north and represents the wisdom of accomplishing activities. These are called the five wisdom Tathāgatas. The four pāramitās are: the vajra pāramitā of the east, the jewel pāramitā of the south, the dharma pāramitā of the west, and the karma pāramitā of the north. The sixteen great bodhisattvas are: four bodhisattvas in the east—Satta, King, Love, and Joy; four bodhisattvas in the south—Jewel, Light, Banner, and Laughter; four bodhisattvas in the west—Dharma, Benefit, Cause, and Speech; four bodhisattvas in the north—Karma, Protection, Tusk, and Fist. The eight offering bodhisattvas are: Joy, Garland, Song, Dance, Incense, Flowers, Lamp, and Ointment. The four embracing bodhisattvas are: Hook, Lasso, Chain, and Bell. These thirty-seven honored ones have been sitting in the space within our chests since beginningless time. Among them, Mahāvairocana Tathāgata is the foundation. The commentary on the Mahāvairocana Sutra manifests this matter, saying: "The true characteristics of all sentient beings' physical bodies have been, since the original limit, constantly this Vairocana, the equal wisdom body. This is not [a matter of] forcibly emptying all dharmas when obtaining bodhi and then first achieving the dharma realm."

Knowing that one Buddha resides within our bodies, still that function is inconceivable. How much more so if we know that the thirty-seven honored ones reside within our bodies—the benefits of realizing great bodhi and transforming delusion into enlightenment should be beyond doubt. However, merely hearing such words, without the cultivation of practice, there can be no such benefit. Generally, this teaching takes immediate bodily buddhahood as its principle, and there are passages that directly discuss the realization of immediate bodily buddhahood. There are also explanations that clarify the benefits of entering the [bodhisattva] stages in this very body. As explained in Amoghavajra's Commentary on the Vajraśekhara Sutra, it appears that one should reach the ultimate fruit in one lifetime. Namely, "What this sutra explains: direct entry, direct cultivation, direct dharma, direct realization—immediately in this life, one obtains the Tathāgata stage through skillful wisdom." The passages like those in the Sokushin-gi clarify entering the first stage in this present life, namely: "If there are sentient beings who encounter this teaching and practice diligently four times day and night, they will realize the Stage of Joy in this present world and achieve perfect enlightenment in the following sixteen lifetimes." Speaking of practicing diligently four times day and night means that with merely casual cultivation, this cannot be accomplished. If the practice is not according to the dharma, one cannot easily obtain those benefits.

Regarding immediate bodily buddhahood, there are three types: first, inherent principle; second, empowerment; third, manifest attainment. Inherent principle immediate bodily buddhahood means, as explained above, that within the very bodies of all sentient beings, the maṇḍalas of both the Diamond and Womb Realms are naturally complete. Empowerment immediate bodily buddhahood means that through the empowerment of the three mysteries, the various honored ones within the body manifest. Manifest attainment immediate bodily buddhahood means that when the practice of the three mysteries is accomplished, one is immediately complete with all practices in the body, truly knows oneself as one really is, and accords with genuine realization. Among these, the buddhahood of inherent principle should exist for every person. The latter two types of buddhahood depend on enduring the functions of the three mysteries and the cultivation of practices and karma, so they are difficult to achieve for those of shallow practice and inferior wisdom. Therefore, the Bodhicitta Treatise judges: "If there are persons of superior faculties and superior wisdom who do not delight in non-Buddhist or two-vehicle dharmas, who have great capacity and are courageous, sharp, and without confusion, they should cultivate the Buddha vehicle." The Commentary on the Mahāvairocana Sutra explains: "If one has already accomplished sharp faculties and wisdom, one should immediately expound the esoteric and reveal it." Śubhakarasiṃha said: "Without the capacity for sudden enlightenment, one cannot enter therein." Amoghavajra stated: "For persons of great spiritual capacity whose dharma connections have matured, the time for explaining the three secret dharmas has arrived." Those of inferior faculties and no wisdom

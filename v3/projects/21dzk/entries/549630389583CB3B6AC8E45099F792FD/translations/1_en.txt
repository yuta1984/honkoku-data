When they say "false," "mixed," "branches," "inferior," and "characteristics," these all refer to the various dharmas outside of mind-dharmas. When they say "real," "pure," "root," "superior," and "essence," these all refer to the single dharma of mind. Therefore, what is called the five levels altogether constitutes the single principle of consciousness-only and mind-only. Thus, by contemplating the principle of consciousness-only and conforming to the stage of true contemplation, because "mind, Buddha, and sentient beings—these three are without distinction," one discusses transforming delusion, opening enlightenment, and achieving Buddhahood and attaining the Way. In the stages of that practice, there are five positions. The five positions are: first, the stage of accumulation (sambhāra); second, the stage of preparation (prayoga); third, the stage of insight (darśana); fourth, the stage of cultivation (bhāvanā); fifth, the stage of completion (niṣṭhā). These five positions are precisely the fifty-one stages of the bodhisattva. The fifty-one stages means not establishing the stage of near-perfect enlightenment within the fifty-two stages. The stage of accumulation is the stage of the Greater Vehicle's conducive-to-liberation division. Within the fifty-one stages are the forty stages of ten faiths, ten abodes, ten practices, and ten dedications of merit. The stage of preparation is the stage of the Greater Vehicle's conducive-to-penetrating-discernment division. This is the final mind of the ten dedications of merit. Up to this point is "before the grounds." The stage of insight is from this point onward, which is "on the grounds." This is precisely the stage of the path of seeing. Among the ten grounds,

this is the first ground. The stage of cultivation is the stage of the path of cultivation. This is the stage from the second ground to reaching the tenth ground. The stage of completion is Buddhahood. This is perfect enlightenment. This school takes the *Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra* and *Vijñapti-mātra-śāstra* as fundamental treatises, and relies on the commentaries of the three masters Cien, Zizhou, and Puyang to exhaust intellectual understanding, cultivate contemplative practices, and seek liberation. However, if one does not enter within those five stages, one is at the stage of the path. Before that, all are ordinary beings. Even if one studies a portion of the doctrinal teachings and develops contemplative understanding of consciousness-only, it is not easy to conform even to the stage of accumulation. How much more difficult it is to ascend to the stages of preparation, insight, and so forth. Therefore, the great patriarch of that school, Bodhisattva Vasubandhu, as well as Master Cien, took the Western [Pure Land] as their aim and each recommended recitation of the Buddha's name. Namely, Vasubandhu composed the *Pure Land Treatise* and became the founding patriarch of one school. Cien wrote the *Essential Decisions on the Western [Pure Land]* and aspired for rebirth in Amitābha's land of peace and nourishment. This is because the fundamental mind of their school involves difficult practices, and cultivation over many eons is hard to accomplish, so they chose the easily-traveled practice and made it the essential point for benefiting self and others. How much more so for

the ignorant monks and laypeople of the latter age—understanding and practice are difficult to cultivate, and advancing in the stages of the path is difficult, so if they single-mindedly take refuge in Amitābha's original vows and aspire for rebirth through nembutsu, this should be a reliable path of liberation.

1. The essence of the Three Treatise School is to establish the Two Repository Teaching and make judgments about the Buddha's lifetime teachings. The Two Repositories are: first, the Śrāvaka Repository; second, the Bodhisattva Repository. The Śrāvaka Repository refers to the Lesser Vehicle. The Bodhisattva Repository refers to the Greater Vehicle. In the Lesser Vehicle, they clarify the path of eliminating delusions and cultivation for the two vehicles; in the Greater Vehicle, they show the characteristics of bodhisattvas' achievement of Buddhahood and attainment of fruition. In this school's gate of attaining the Way, they take the correct contemplation of the Eight Negations as the true essential for entering principle. The Eight Negations means departing from the views of arising-ceasing, going-coming, sameness-difference, and annihilation-permanence. These are precisely: no-arising, no-ceasing, no-going, no-coming, no-sameness, no-difference, no-annihilation, no-permanence. If one can well contemplate and penetrate this profound principle and truly conform to the correct contemplation of the Eight Negations, then there would be nothing in birth-and-death that could invite the karmic results of transmigration, nothing in going-coming that could lead to birth-places of good and evil, nothing in sameness-difference that could separate birth-and-death, and nothing in annihilation-permanence that could cause delusion about emptiness and existence. Generally, the mind of this school uses the one to break the three. When the three cease, the one is also lost—teaching the One Vehicle is for the purpose of breaking attachment to the Three Vehicles. If attachment to the Three Vehicles is lost, there should be no One Vehicle either. Also, teaching emptiness is for the purpose of breaking existence. If existence is lost, emptiness should not be maintained either. Therefore,

in Jiaxiang's commentary, sometimes saying "if one barely raises a single thought, one immediately falls into annihilation and permanence," and sometimes interpreting "if one wishes to apply even a little mind, one immediately goes against and harms the Buddha," they seek to contemplate and penetrate the place where good and evil emotional measures are forgotten and not a single thought arises. Regarding discussion of the stages and positions of practice, though this school also discusses the previous five stages, establishing the cultivation of each stage is a doctrinal establishment. Taking the transcendence of the five stages in a single thought as the ultimate achievement. The Three Treatises are: first, the *Madhyamaka-śāstra*, four volumes, composed by Bodhisattva Nāgārjuna. Second, the *Śata-śāstra*, two volumes, composed by Bodhisattva Āryadeva. Third, the *Dvādaśa-dvāra-śāstra*, one volume, also composed by Nāgārjuna. These three treatises are treatises that comprehensively explain the Buddha's lifetime teachings. The mind of the present Three Treatise School, regarding the various teachings of the Buddha's lifetime, does not discuss shallow-deep or superior-inferior, but various

**Upper Section:**
[The generating cause] originally desires to produce the wisdom of newly generated understanding of the thesis. The understanding cause originally desires to manifest the fruit of clear understanding of the thesis. If this is so, then the six causes and two fruits are evident. Some people consider the wisdom-understanding cause to be the understanding fruit, but what is their intention? Answer: Such delusions and errors are extremely numerous in the world and cannot be taken as authoritative sources.

**Displaying the Nine Sentence Gate:** The nine sentences refer to three types of three, making nine sentences total. The first three sentences are: 1) present in similar cases and present in dissimilar cases, 2) present in similar cases and absent in dissimilar cases, 3) present in similar cases and both present and absent in dissimilar cases. The middle three sentences are: 1) absent in similar cases and present in dissimilar cases, 2) absent in similar cases and absent in dissimilar cases, 3) absent in similar cases and both present and absent in dissimilar cases. The latter three sentences are: 1) both present and absent in similar cases and present in dissimilar cases, 2) both present and absent in similar cases and absent in dissimilar cases, 3) both present and absent in similar cases and both present and absent in dissimilar cases.

The verse on the nine theses states: "Permanent, impermanent, energetic effort, eternally abiding firm nature, non-energetic, transient, non-pervasive - through the measurable and eight others." The first line refers to the first three thesis-sentences, the second line to the middle three thesis-sentences, the third line to the latter three thesis-sentences.

**Lower Section:**
The examples demonstrate various logical arguments between different philosophical schools (Sound theorists vs. Vijñānavāda theorists vs. Buddhist disciples) regarding the permanence or impermanence of sound, using different logical reasons and examples. The text analyzes which of these constitute valid reasoning (proper causes), contradictory reasoning, or indefinite reasoning.

**Left Page Upper Section:**
The text continues analyzing the logical validity of different arguments, particularly focusing on how the "understanding cause" functions in different contexts and whether certain logical formulations constitute valid inference or contain logical fallacies.

**Lower Section:**
The discussion focuses on three different explanations for why certain logical formulations are considered valid despite apparent problems with their supporting examples. The text concludes that the second explanation is correct, emphasizing that "definite presence in similar cases" does not require "universal presence."

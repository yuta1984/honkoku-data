**Upper Section**
Q: "In Buddhist doctrine, neither Hīnayāna nor Mahāyāna has this doctrine at all. The four great elements are the creators and the four subtle elements are the created, yet what is now established completely contradicts this doctrine. How can this be believed? That treatise's meaning says: the four subtle elements are the creators, the four great elements are the created; the four great elements are the creators, the five sense organs are the created. If so, the four subtle elements are consistently creators, the five sense organs are consistently created, and the four great elements partake of both. How can such contradictions be reconciled?"

A: "I do not see a reconciliation. One can only reconcile it oneself. That form, smell, taste, and touch are creators is known through the four subtle elements existing within earth, water, fire, and wind. The four great elements are created by the four subtle elements. One can only reconcile based on this analogy. Scholars of that school say: The four subtle elements are real existents and serve as creators. The four great elements are provisionally established, hence they are created."

Q: "Why are the four subtle elements real existents in essence while the four great elements are provisionally existent?"

A: "Earth's solidity, water's wetness, fire's heat, and wind's movement arise only through the assistance of the four subtle elements. Since the four great elements arise dependent on the four subtle elements, the four great elements are provisional and created."

Q: "If so, do earth's solidity and so forth exist upon the four subtle elements or are they complete upon the four great elements?"

A: "Through the power of the four subtle elements, solidity and so forth finally arise and are provisionally named the four great elements. Being provisionally established, they are created."

Q: "If so, the four great elements are precisely created by the four subtle elements. Do the four subtle elements necessarily combine to create the four great elements, or do they individually and separately create the four great elements?"

A: "The three great elements are all created by the four subtle elements. One great element is created by two subtle elements."

Q: "What are the three great elements?"

A: "Earth, water, and fire—these three. These are created by four (subtle elements). That one great element is the wind element. It is created only by smell and touch."

Q: "In the Mahāyāna Abhidharma

**Lower Section**
school, seven preparatory practices are established before the path of seeing. Does this treatise's doctrine also have such?"

A: "This Satyasiddhi-śāstra only establishes five preparatory practices and does not speak of seven."

Q: "What are excluded in establishing those five preparatory practices?"

A: "The foundations of mindfulness count as one, combined with the four wholesome roots to make five."

Q: "The foundations of mindfulness number four: body, feelings, mind, and dharmas. Why combine them into one? What impediment would there be in combining those four wholesome roots into one and expanding the foundations of mindfulness into four?"

A: "In the contemplation of foundations of mindfulness, one person observes only one and enters the four wholesome roots. One need not necessarily possess the four mindfulnesses. In the contemplation of wholesome roots, one person must observe four. If one does not fully contemplate, one cannot enter seeing. Therefore those four foundations of mindfulness are combined into one preparatory practice, and these four wholesome roots are expanded into four preparatory practices."

Q: "Among the four truths, what extinction does the truth of cessation extinguish to be called the truth of cessation?"

A: "Because it extinguishes the three minds, it is called the truth of cessation."

Q: "What are the three minds?"

A: "First, the conventional mind; second, the real dharma mind; third, the emptiness mind. These are called the three minds."

Q: "What are the conventional mind and so forth?"

A: "Being deluded about conventional dharmas is called the conventional mind. Being deluded about the real dharma mind is called the real dharma mind. The mind that realizes the principle of emptiness is called the emptiness mind."

Q: "How are these three called cessation?"

A: "The first two minds are deluded minds that must be extinguished. The emptiness mind, being conditioned dharma, is suffering dharma, so it must be extinguished."

Q: "The first two minds are deluded minds, hence called cessation. If so, do they correspond to the two attachments of person and dharma?"

A: "The conventional mind is attachment to persons. The real dharma mind is attachment to dharmas."

Q: "What attachment is the emptiness mind?"

A: "The essence of the emptiness mind is conditioned phenomena,

called the emptiness mind. Not being delusion, it is not the dharma of the two attachments."

Q: "In that school, they speak of 'attaining the path by seeing existence, attaining the path by seeing emptiness.' What does this mean?"

A: "Seeing that the four noble truths exist, one attains the path. Seeing that the four noble truths are empty, one attains the path."

Q: "In this school's doctrine, what path attainment do they establish?"

A: "Attaining the path by seeing emptiness. This is the school's doctrine. Attaining the path by seeing existence is not this school's tenet."

Q: "If so, attaining the path by seeing existence belongs to which school's doctrine?"

A: "This is Sarvāstivāda doctrine."

Q: "If so, does this school not speak of the four truths as existent?"

A: "Regarding conventional truth, one may speak thus. Only those who correctly enter seeing and attain the path see emptiness and enter the path."

Q: "To which of the twenty schools does this treatise belong?"

A: "Though there are many teachers' explanations, it belongs to the Sautrāntika school. This is the correct doctrine."

Q: "If so, the Sautrāntika school establishes seeds. Are they present in this treatise?"

A: "This treatise can be said to establish seeds."

Q: "In which passage of the treatise text are they found?"

A: "In the treatise's second fascicle, the Chapter on the Four Truths states: 'Those who enter cessation concentration, though lacking manifest consciousness, can possess consciousness.' The first fascicle states: 'In the continuation of birth and death, constantly following sentient beings, hence called latent defilements.' Based on these passages, the existence of seeds is established."

Q: "If seeds are established based on these passages, why do some teachers explain that this treatise belongs to the Bahuśrutīya school, and that Bahuśrutīya school does not establish seeds?"

A: "Belonging to the Bahuśrutīya school is incorrect doctrine."

Q: "In the treatise's title, why is the treatise called the Satyasiddhi-śāstra?"

A: "Siddhi in Sanskrit is jñānaka, which in Chinese means 'establishment.' Satya in Sanskrit is rūpavat

mus, which in Chinese means 'truth.' Śāstra in Sanskrit is upadeśa, which in Chinese means 'treatise.' 'Establishment' means revealing and establishing doctrine. Revealing means manifesting. Establishing means abiding. What was hidden in the past is now revealed. Revealing and causing to abide—hence it is called 'establishment.' 'Truth' means genuine doctrine, receiving its name in contrast to the conventional. 'Establishment' clarifies utility, speaking in terms of benefiting people. 'Truth' discusses genuine reality, establishing the name based on the essence itself. Thus 'truth' refers to the four truths. To accomplish this dharma, this treatise was composed. It is called the Satyasiddhi-śāstra to reveal the treatise's name. 'Establishment' is the name of what establishes, with revealing and establishing as its meaning. 'Truth' is the principle that is established, with genuine reality as its meaning. It refers to the principle of the four noble truths. Because its essence is not false, it is called 'truth.' This treatise can reveal and establish, hence it is called 'establishment.'

Within this there are four types: First, establishing teaching through teaching means using treatise teaching to establish sūtra teaching. Second, establishing principle through teaching means using the treatise's expressing teaching to establish the sūtra's expressed principle. Third, establishing teaching through principle means using the treatise's expressed principle to establish sūtra teaching. Fourth, establishing principle through principle means using treatise principle to establish sūtra principle.

Establishing teaching through teaching and establishing principle through teaching are "establishment-truth namely treatise"—karmadhāraya compound naming. Establishing teaching through principle and establishing principle through principle are "establishment of truth treatise"—tatpuruṣa compound naming.

**Abhidharmakośa School**

Abhidharmakośa-śāstra-ṭīkā. This is the Sanskrit. In China it is translated as "Treasury of Abhidharma Treatise." This treatise is one work in thirty fascicles with nine chapters combined. It has 600 verses. Both the root verses and commentary were composed by Vasubandhu.

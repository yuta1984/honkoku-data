...because of non-self. The fourth gate of truth is because mind and language are severed. Both seem to have no distinct characteristics. "No perceiver and perceived" means: consciousness is the perceiver, objects are the perceived. Within consciousness, function is the perceiver, substance is the perceived.

Based on this passage, the four truths serve as "true." If the first conventional [truth] holds that mind immediately separates, then in opposition to the four truths, all lack the meaning of separation. The first truth-gate is like illusory phenomena. The second truth-gate is because of causality. The third truth-gate is collectively because of non-self. The fourth truth-gate is because mind and language are severed. Against the attachment to characteristic-separation, non-separation is taught.

The **Abhidharmakośa**, Volume 22, verses on the two truths state: "When that awareness is broken, it ceases to exist; when wisdom analyzes, the remainder is likewise. Like bottles and water are conventional; what differs from this is called ultimate." The verse's meaning reveals: if a dharma loses its name when broken, it is called conventional truth. If a dharma is difficult to break and doesn't lose its name, it is ultimate truth.

The text explains that conventional phenomena like jars, armies, and forests lose their names when broken down, while their constituent elements (the four primary elements) are difficult to break and retain their names, making them ultimate.

The text discusses how different Buddhist schools establish the two truths differently, requiring the four truths to make proper distinctions against various interpretations.

**Question:** How can the fourth truth-gate, where mind and language are severed and verbal expression is exhausted, speak of separation or non-separation?

**Answer:** Although mind and language are severed, in consciousness-only nature, since it is already the nature of form and mind, and their natures are identical, how can one insist on separation?

The text then explains the famous **"extremely established form" (極成色)** terminology from Yogācāra logic, identifying **four categories**:
1. **Self-established but other-unestablished form**: Buddha-forms in other realms (accepted by Mahāyāna but not Hinayāna)
2. **Other-established but self-unestablished form**: Defiled forms of final-birth bodhisattvas (accepted by Hinayāna but not Mahāyāna)  
3. **Both self and other established form**: Forms commonly recognized by all, like eye-objects
4. **Neither self nor other established form**: Forms with self-nature posited by non-Buddhist schools

The text continues explaining the **five relationships** between **eye-consciousness and the eye-faculty**:
1. **Dependence** (依): consciousness depends on the faculty
2. **Generation** (発): consciousness is generated by the faculty  
3. **Belonging** (属): consciousness belongs to the faculty
4. **Assistance** (助): consciousness assists the faculty
5. **Similarity** (如): consciousness is similar to the faculty

**Lower Section:**
The discussion moves to logical terminology, explaining why **"self-acceptance"** (自許) is used instead of **"mutual acceptance"** (共許) in Buddhist logical formulations. 

The text warns that without proper qualification, one risks the **fallacy of contradiction with the subject's own characteristics** (有法自相違). For example, if one simply states "extremely established form does not separate from eye-consciousness," both Mahāyāna (affirming this) and Hinayāna (denying this) schools could construct contradictory arguments, leading to logical inconsistency.

The page concludes by beginning to show how such contradictory syllogisms could be formulated by opponents.

Initially being far removed, it is named "No Heat." The form and appearance of that heaven are upright and wonderful, surpassing the heavens below, so it is named "Good Appearance." Their forms become superior and all beings enjoy observing them, so it is named "Good Vision." The forms of that heaven are most excellent and wonderful, with none others matching them, so it is named "Ultimate Form." Or, having already reached the ultimate edge of the body that is the basis of all sufferings, it is named "Ultimate Form."

Question: How can we know the vessel capacity, body size, and lifespan of those realms?
Answer: First, I explain vessel capacity. The vessel capacity of all first dhyānas equals a small chiliocosm. The vessel capacity of the second dhyāna equals a medium chiliocosm. The vessel capacity of the third dhyāna equals a great chiliocosm. The vessel capacity of the fourth dhyāna is immeasurable and boundless, impossible to measure.

Next, I explain body size. The body size of Brahmakāyika Heaven in the first dhyāna is half a yojana. The body of Brahmapurohita Heaven is one yojana. The body of Mahābrahmā Heaven is one and a half yojanas. In the second dhyāna, the body of Parīttābha Heaven is two yojanas. The body of Apramāṇābha Heaven is four yojanas. The body of Ābhāsvara Heaven is eight yojanas. In the third dhyāna, the body of Parīttaśubha Heaven is sixteen yojanas. The body of Apramāṇaśubha Heaven is thirty-two yojanas. The body of Śubhakṛtsna Heaven is sixty-four yojanas. In the fourth dhyāna, the body of Anabhraka Heaven is 125 yojanas. The body of Puṇyaprasava Heaven is 250 yojanas. The body of Bṛhatphala Heaven is 500 yojanas. The body of Avṛha Heaven is 1,000 yojanas. The body of Atapa Heaven is 2,000 yojanas. The body of Sudṛśa Heaven is 4,000 yojanas. The body of Sudarśana Heaven is 8,000 yojanas. The body of Akaniṣṭha Heaven is 16,000 yojanas.

Later, I explain lifespans. The lifespan of Brahmakāyika Heaven in the first dhyāna is one kalpa of twenty intermediate kalpas. The lifespan of Brahmapurohita Heaven is one kalpa of forty intermediate kalpas. The lifespan of Mahābrahmā Heaven is one kalpa of sixty intermediate kalpas. In the second dhyāna, the lifespan of Parīttābha Heaven is one kalpa of eighty intermediate kalpas. The lifespan of Apramāṇābha Heaven is four kalpas of eighty intermediate kalpas. The lifespan of Ābhāsvara Heaven is eight kalpas of eighty intermediate kalpas. In the third dhyāna, the lifespan of Parīttaśubha Heaven is sixteen kalpas of eighty intermediate kalpas. The lifespan of Apramāṇaśubha Heaven is thirty-two kalpas of eighty intermediate kalpas. The lifespan of Śubhakṛtsna Heaven is sixty-four kalpas of eighty intermediate kalpas. In the fourth dhyāna, the lifespan of Anabhraka Heaven is 125 kalpas of eighty intermediate kalpas. The lifespan of Puṇyaprasava Heaven is 256 kalpas of eighty intermediate kalpas. The lifespan of Bṛhatphala Heaven is 512 kalpas of eighty intermediate kalpas. The lifespan of Avṛha Heaven is 1,024 kalpas of eighty intermediate kalpas. The lifespan of Atapa Heaven is 2,048 kalpas of eighty intermediate kalpas. The lifespan of Sudṛśa Heaven is 4,096 kalpas of eighty intermediate kalpas. The lifespan of Sudarśana Heaven is 8,192 kalpas of eighty intermediate kalpas. The lifespan of Akaniṣṭha Heaven is 16,384 kalpas of eighty intermediate kalpas.

Question: What kinds of enjoyments do the heavenly beings of those realms have?
Answer: There are three enjoyments: food and drink enjoyment, pleasure and pain enjoyment, and sexual desire enjoyment. In this realm now, there are no food/drink and sexual desire enjoyments. Among pleasure and pain enjoyments, the first two dhyānas correspond to joy-feeling, the third dhyāna corresponds to pleasure-feeling, and the fourth dhyāna and above have only equanimity-feeling. Thus, the first two dhyānas have only joy-enjoyment, the third dhyāna has only pleasure-enjoyment, and the fourth dhyāna and above have only equanimity-enjoyment, with no other enjoyments. Worry is removed through detachment from desire, and suffering is abandoned in the second dhyāna, so they only experience joy, pleasure, and equanimity.

Later, clarifying the formless realm: Within it there are three aspects: 1) explaining names, 2) lifespans, and 3) distinguishing characteristics. Regarding explaining names, first comes the general name, then specific names. Regarding the general name: among the lower two realms, the desire realm has desires and the form realm has forms. This realm completely lacks both, so it is named "formless." Because it lacks material form from karma, it has only form from concentration. The meaning of "realm" is as elsewhere.

Regarding specific names, first I list them, then explain. Listing the names: 1) Sphere of Infinite Space, 2) Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, 3) Sphere of Nothingness, 4) Sphere of Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception.

Explaining the names: When cultivating that concentration, one must first be disgusted with form and contemplate infinite space. Thus one creates the understanding of infinite space, named "Sphere of Infinite Space." Next, being disgusted with external space, one contemplates infinite consciousness. Thus one creates the understanding of infinite consciousness, named "Sphere of Infinite Consciousness." Next, being disgusted with internal consciousness, one contemplates nothingness. Thus one creates the understanding of nothingness, named "Sphere of Nothingness." Next, it is not the coarse perceptions of the lower seven concentrations, so it is named "non-perception." It is not the same as no-mind, so it is named "non-non-perception." Therefore it is named "Sphere of Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception." "Sphere" means it is a place where sentient beings grow and develop.

Question: Those first three spheres get their names from perception, but how does this last sphere get its name?
Answer: Those first three spheres get their names from preparatory practices. This last sphere's essence is neither the former nor no-mind. It gets its name from its own nature.

**Chapter Revealing the Distinctions of the Five Realms in General**

Sentient beings have destinations according to their karma, so they are called "realms" (gati). Because there are five such destinations, they are called "five." Established among the four and six with five names, they are collectively called the "five realms." Or they are called the "five paths" because the paths of destination are not mixed.

Question: What are the five realms?
Answer: 1) Heavenly beings, 2) Humans, 3) Animals, 4) Hungry ghosts, 5) Hell beings. Or there are six realms, adding asuras. Because the paths of destination differ, they are named the "six paths."

Question: What is called the "heavenly realm"?
Answer: Having the meaning of luminosity and also sovereignty, they are named "heavenly." Though the heavenly beings of desire and form realms lack sun and moon, their body-light shines without borrowing other light. Heavenly beings of the desire realm have sovereignty over the five sublime desires. Heavenly beings of the form realm are free from the defilements of the desire realm and gain sovereignty over the bliss of meditative concentration. Heavenly beings of the formless realm are far removed from material form and gain sovereignty over that tranquil form.

Question: Why are they called "humans"?
Answer: The meaning of "contemplation" is precisely "human." Among humans, contemplation mostly increases. Also, "human" means "benevolence." Those among humans who lack benevolence are called "non-human."

Question: What are called "animals"?
Answer: "Domestic" means to provide resources, pleasantly providing for the body. "Life" means nourishment, further enjoying food and drink to nourish life.

Question: What are called "hungry ghosts"?
Answer: "Hungry" means starvation, being mostly oppressed by hunger and thirst. "Ghost" means spirit, having small wonders.

Question: What are the characteristics of hell?
Answer: "Ground" means earth, "prison" means confinement. Being confined and imprisoned within the ground, it is named "hell." Heavenly beings get their name from luminosity and sovereignty. Humans get their name from contemplation and benevolence. Animals get their name from nourishing and being nourished. Hungry ghosts get their name from thirst. Hell beings get their name from dwelling place and obstruction.

Question: What constitutes the essence of sentient beings in these five realms and six paths?

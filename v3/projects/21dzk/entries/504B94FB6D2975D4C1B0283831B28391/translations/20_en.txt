**Chapter 3 of the Mahāyāna Yogācāra Research Divine Text**

Q: "Why are there no causes and conditions for expounding sutras [in the form realm]?"
A: "The Xiāngyáng Treatise states: 'Extreme suffering does not equal that of the evil destinies; extreme bliss does not equal that of the upper realms [form and formless realms]. Therefore, Buddha appears in the human and heavenly realms of the desire realm.' According to this treatise, the heavenly places of the form realm are places of extreme bliss where there is no mind that abhors suffering. Therefore, this sutra is not expounded in those heavenly places."

Q: "After the Tathāgata attained enlightenment, why did he not expound this sutra during the first seven days, but expounded it in the second seven days after the first seven days had passed?"
A: "The Ten Stages Treatise states: 'Due to contemplative practice and causal practice,' the Buddha did not teach during the first seven days."

Q: "What is the meaning of the treatise's statement about 'contemplative practice and causal practice'?"
A: "The Tathāgata's appearance in the world is fundamentally for the purpose of teaching the Dharma. Rationally, one must contemplate and deliberate whether it is appropriate to teach. Therefore, contemplation is necessary. This contemplative practice and causal practice means that what gives rise to Buddhahood is called causes and conditions. There are two causes and conditions: first, Buddha-nature causes and conditions; second, Ten Stages causes and conditions. By having Buddha seed-nature and having Ten Stages practice, Buddha seed-nature serves as the primary cause and Ten Stages practice as auxiliary conditions to generate Buddhahood. After contemplating sentient beings' Buddha seed-nature causes and Ten Stages strong conditions and deliberating, then teaching is given. Therefore, during the first seven days, the Buddha did not teach."

Q: "The Buddha's intention in appearing in the world is originally to benefit sentient beings. Why does he further contemplate their causes and conditions? What kind of contemplation is this?"
A: "First, [he contemplates] what Dharma to demonstrate so that various sentient beings will generate faith. Such contemplation and deliberation occurs because the intention of appearing in the world is for sentient beings' attainment of Buddhahood. Thus [he considers] whether sentient beings have Buddha-nature causes, Ten Stages causes, or Three Worthy Stages conditions. Since the Buddha knew and saw that some sentient beings have Buddha-nature causes, he expounded this sutra. Knowing and seeing that some sentient beings have indeterminate nature, he further expounded the sequential teachings of the Three Periods."

Q: "Originally, to save sentient beings, [the Buddha] achieved Buddhahood. Having just achieved Buddhahood and immediately attaining complete universal enlightenment, why did he not teach for several days?"
A: "First, to show that the attained Way is vast, deep, and profound, and to personally enjoy this bliss. Second, to cause sentient beings to generate deep faith and joy. Third, to accord with worldly conventions. Fourth, to have future [beings] learn such matters."

Q: "We already know the places of sutra exposition are seven places. The assembly gatherings are in nine assemblies. Why are there only seven places but nine assemblies?"
A: "Because there were three repeated assemblies at Puguangming Hall, making nine assemblies in total."

Q: "What is the reason for the repeated assemblies at Puguangming Hall?"
A: "It is the place where faith is initially aroused, with three levels of foundation."

Q: "The Ten Stages Treatise explains the Six Aspects to eliminate fixed attachments. What does this mean?"
A: "To show that phenomena have no fixed nature, these Six Aspects are explained."

Q: "I would like to hear about these Six Aspects. What are the Six Aspects?"
A: "First, universal aspect; second, particular aspect; third, same aspect; fourth, different aspect; fifth, formation aspect; sixth, destruction aspect."

Q: "How are the universal aspect and others [understood]?"
A: "A person serves as the universal aspect, while the four great elements and five aggregates serve as particular aspects. When speaking of a person, including the five aggregates constitutes the universal aspect. The included five aggregates, being not-one, constitute the particular aspect. Since the particular depends on the universal to form the universal, although not-one, they do not contradict each other. Being able to form the universal, this is the same aspect. However, each being different constitutes the different aspect. Becoming one conditioned origination body is the formation aspect. Each abiding in its own dharma without transferring is the destruction aspect. Phenomena have no fixed nature. It is truly thus - do not cling to having fixed nature."

Q: "Seeds have six characteristics. The Mahāyāna-saṃgraha Treatise explains this, and in the second volume of that treatise, among five verses, the second verse states: 'Momentary destruction, simultaneous existence, constant continuation, should be known as determined, depending on various conditions, only able to produce its own fruit.' The first characteristic of momentary destruction was renamed by Master Fazang as 'emptiness, having power, not waiting for conditions.' What is the meaning of this renaming?"
A: "The meaning of renaming is to reveal profound meaning, not merely changing names."

Q: "What is this profound meaning?"
A: "Seeds are called empty because they are empty of inherent nature. Dependent origination phenomena first do not exist, then exist, and after existing, return to non-existence. Struck and activated by conditions, they now appear to exist. We do not know where they come from. After existing, they return to non-existence - we do not know where they go. Therefore, they are provisionally called inherently empty, etc. The phrase 'having power' shows that they have superior strength in producing subsequent phenomena. 'Not waiting for conditions' means destruction does not wait for conditions, hence the name reveals the meaning."

Q: "It says they are called 'having power' because they have the power to produce what follows. Do they produce what follows at the time of destruction or at the time of arising?"
A: "They produce at the time of destruction. When destroyed and entering the past, since the past has no substance, how can it produce what follows? Also, the destruction of the previous phenomenon and the arising of the subsequent phenomenon occur simultaneously. How can that seed simultaneously produce itself? The Saṃgraha Treatise's meaning is that being conditioned, it necessarily perishes momentarily; it does not say that it produces what follows at the time of destruction. The meaning of similar types producing what follows is because they constantly continue."

Q: "Since it already speaks of momentary destruction, this is a phenomenon with characteristics. Why change its name to emptiness? If emptiness could be destroyed, then space could also be destroyed. Since it is already empty, why would it be destroyed? This reasoning is not stable. It should follow the treatise text: first, momentary destruction; second, simultaneous with fruit; third, constant continuation; fourth, determined nature; fifth, depending on various conditions; sixth, producing its own fruit. That is to say, seed phenomena must possess all six characteristics; what does not necessarily possess all six is not called a seed."

Q: "What is the meaning of nine times and ten times?"
A: "Each of the three times possessing the meaning of three times is called nine times; collectively taking the three as one is called ten times."

Q: "Why are there also three within the three times?"
A: "For example, regarding past time: the past of the past, the present of the past, the future of the past. The others are similar. A verse in the 59th volume of the sutra states: 'All past kalpas are repositioned in future and present; future and present kalpas are repositioned in past time.' Based on this text, nine and ten times are established."

Q: "Such revolution - which of the eighteen transformations does it belong to?"
A: "Time has no separate substance; time is provisionally established based on cause-effect interdependence. Only the mind is transformed; objects have no meaning of transformation. Only the mental conceptions of sentient beings to be transformed are changed, while time itself does not revolve. This is transformation."

Q: "What is the meaning of the Simultaneous Complete Correspondence Gate?"
A: "Taking the water wheel and above of the Wonderful Joy World, cutting it off and placing it in the palm, showing the ten directions at the same time - this is the manifestation transformation among the eighteen transformations. The ten simultaneous aspects of teaching, meaning, principle, phenomena, cause, effect, teacher, disciple, etc., are merely words without reality, just empty speech. Others are similar - all are the power of the eighteen transformations produced by supernatural powers."

Q: "Present reward benefits are for receiving positions; future reward benefits are for being born in the place of Māheśvara Asura wisdom. What is the meaning of this text from the 39th volume explaining the Tenth Dharma Cloud Stage?"
A: "The body of the Tenth Dharma Cloud Stage bodhisattva is the final body with outflows in the three realms, the final retribution body. Being born in the Palace of Maheśvara is called future reward. Birth there is great benefit. Since the positions of all Buddhas are conferred in this very body, it is called present reward benefit."

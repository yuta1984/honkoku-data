There are one hundred billion eight intermediate continents, one hundred billion hells, one hundred billion realms of hungry ghosts, one hundred billion asura realms, one hundred billion six desire heavens, one hundred billion four dhyānas, and one hundred billion four places of the formless realm. This is called the distinction of the three-thousand great thousand world system. The meaning is: taking the area illuminated by one sun and moon as one world, and accumulating such worlds to make one thousand, this is called the small thousand world. Taking the small thousand world as one world and accumulating one thousand worlds, this is called the medium thousand world. Taking the medium thousand world as one world and accumulating one thousand worlds, this is called the great thousand world.

Question: Why is the three-thousand great thousand world system considered as one world system? Why is it not called a two-thousand or four-thousand great thousand world system? Answer: There is an iron-encircling mountain that surrounds the small thousand world, whose height reaches the first dhyāna of the form realm. There is an iron-encircling mountain that surrounds the medium thousand world, whose height reaches the summit of the second dhyāna. There is an iron-encircling mountain that surrounds the great thousand world, whose height reaches the summit of the third dhyāna. These iron-encircling mountains exist only as three encirclements, not four. Therefore, the world system consists of the three-thousand great thousand worlds.

Question: Each of the four continents is also surrounded by iron-encircling mountains, so why not four thousand? Answer: The small iron-encircling mountains of those four continents are not counted among the three thousand. They do not even reach the summit of the desire realm, being only about three hundred yojanas. Therefore, they are not included in the count.

Question: Having already understood that within such a three-thousand great thousand world system there are one hundred billion Mount Sumerus, one hundred billion suns and moons, and one hundred billion four-continent systems, each four-continent system has four continents. Among these four continents, South Jambudvīpa has 2,500 rivers flowing into the great ocean, West Aparagodānīya has 5,000 rivers flowing into the great ocean, East Pūrvavideha has 7,500 rivers flowing into the great ocean, and North Uttarakuru has 10,000 rivers flowing into the great ocean. In these four continents, these 25,000 rivers flow continuously without interruption. This water is extremely abundant, and sometimes over one hundred dragon kings rain into the great streams, doubling the previous river water.

Question: Why doesn't the water of the great ocean increase and overflow? Answer: The great ocean contains four blazing luminous great jewels placed at its bottom. Their nature is extremely fierce and hot, constantly able to drink and absorb immeasurable great waters. Therefore, the great ocean neither increases nor decreases. What are the four? First is called Treasury, second is called Separation from Moisture, third is called Great Flame Light, and fourth is called Complete Exhaustion. If these four jewels were not in the great ocean, everything from the four continents up to the summit of existence would all be swept away and submerged.

Question: Why is the taste of the great ocean water salty? Answer: There are two causes for the water's salty taste. Question: What are the two causes? Answer: First, the merit of sentient beings born there is superior; second, a portion of terrestrial sentient beings lack superior merit. Therefore, the ocean water tastes salty.

Question: How should the meaning of the first cause be understood? Answer: Because the water is salty, it is not traversed by humans, and the immeasurable subtle sentient beings born there are not killed or harmed. Question: How should the meaning of the second cause be understood? Answer: Also, various precious treasures of different kinds can be obtained in the great ocean. Because the water is salty, it is difficult for a portion of terrestrial sentient beings to obtain them.

Gateway of World Formation Characteristics

In demonstrating world formation characteristics, there are three within this: first, world formation characteristics destroyed by fire disasters; second, world formation characteristics destroyed by water disasters; third, world formation characteristics destroyed by wind disasters.

First, what are the world formation characteristics destroyed by fire disasters? Long ago, when the empty eon ended, at that time the vessel world of the first dhyāna of the form realm was first formed in empty space, appearing suddenly as if through spontaneous birth. The vessel worlds of the three heavens suddenly manifested, with palaces already formed. At that time, various divine princes whose karma in the second dhyāna and above was exhausted gradually came to be born there. With brilliant radiance and immeasurable divine virtue, the first to be born became the Great Brahmā King. Next, the palaces of the four heavens dwelling in space of the desire realm naturally formed in empty space, also appearing suddenly as if through spontaneous birth. Those with exhausted karma from upper heavens and other worlds who had karmic connections all came to be born there accordingly. These five heavens above were formed from above downward. All these matters were accomplished by the karmic power of sentient beings.

After this formation, due to the increased karmic power of various sentient beings, a great wind wheel arose from below, equal in measure to the three-thousand great thousand world system. This wind wheel has two kinds of characteristics: first, upward circular spreading; second, lateral spreading. The thickness of the wind wheel is 1.6 billion yojanas. It is extremely solid and firm - even if a person with the great strength of Nārāyaṇa struck this wind wheel with a diamond pestle, the pestle would break but the wind wheel would not move.

Then, due to the karmic power of sentient beings, a great cloud suddenly arose in empty space, called the Golden Treasury Cloud, which poured forth great golden rain from the cloud. Above the wind wheel was another great wind that struck this golden water and made it solid. This is called the golden-natured earth wheel. Its thickness is 320 million yojanas, and its breadth is 1.234 billion 450 yojanas.

After the golden-natured earth wheel became solidly formed, another great cloud arose in empty space, called the Ocean Treasury Cloud, which rained great rain from the cloud. This rain formed in various ways into great water masses. Additionally, another wind stirred the water and made it firm. The purest, most excellent, and most refined among these formed Mount Sumeru (the wonderful high mountain). This mountain is composed of four jewels: the eastern face is of silver nature, the western face of gold nature, the southern face of lapis lazuli, and the northern face of crystal. It is perfectly square, measuring 168,000 yojanas. 84,000 yojanas float in the water below, and 84,000 yojanas stand prominently above ground. In the above-ground prominence, the upper 42,000 yojanas stand directly upright. At the summit are four peaks, each 500 yojanas, and on each of the four peaks dwell eight divine princes - these are the four times eight, or thirty-two devas. In the center is Indra's palace, making a total of thirty-three lords.

From the lower 42,000 yojanas, there are four tiers, and within them the various grades form seven golden mountains that encircle Mount Sumeru. The first golden mountain is called持雙山 (持双山), half of Mount Sumeru at over 40,000 yojanas. The second golden mountain is called 障礙山 (Obstacle Mountain). The third golden mountain is called 馬耳山 (Horse Ear Mountain). The fourth golden mountain is called 善見山 (Good Sight Mountain). The fifth golden mountain is called 檐木山 (Eaves Wood Mountain). The sixth golden mountain is called 持軸山 (Axis-Holding Mountain). The seventh golden mountain is called 尼民達羅山 (Nimindhara Mountain), half of the previous mountain, namely 2,500 yojanas.

In the lower grades, outside the seven golden mountains surrounding Mount Sumeru on all four sides, the four great continents and eight intermediate continents are formed. Five hundred small islands exist along with them. Outside the four eight continents is an iron-encircling mountain, 312 yojanas high, surrounding those four continents. Next, the asura palace is formed. This palace is located directly beneath Mount Sumeru, dwelling dependent on water, 80,000 yojanas wide and 500 yojanas thick. Next, the great snow mountains and the Anavatapta great lake are formed.

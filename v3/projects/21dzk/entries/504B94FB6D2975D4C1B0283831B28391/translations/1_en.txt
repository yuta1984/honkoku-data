The three realms and nine stages are the dwelling places of conscious beings. The five destinies and four births are the retribution of ignorance. From originally suffering conditions until now, there has been no peaceful essence. The six thieves constantly follow seeking opportunities, and the three poisons constantly arise leading to delusion. The wise know this and hope for liberation; the virtuous are clear about this and do not delight in entering it. Since this is already a lamentable state, who would not contemplate it? Moreover, since these are beings to be saved, why would one not investigate and study? I briefly show a small beginning, hoping to defer to broader understanding.

　　　The Gate Generally Revealing the Distinctions of the Three Realms
First, listing names; second, explaining meanings; third, distinguishing characteristics. Listing names: first, the desire realm; second, the form realm; third, the formless realm. Explaining meanings: the realm where desire depends, the realm to which desire belongs, is called the desire realm. The realm where form depends, the realm to which form belongs, is called the form realm. Where formlessness depends, what formlessness belongs to, is called the formless realm.

Question: What kind of desire is this desire? Answer: This desire has two kinds: first, the desire for solid food; second, the desire of sexual lust. Now this realm is where these two desires touch and trouble, hence it is called the desire realm. Question: In the form realm, why is it called "form"? Answer: The two desires of food and sex have already been left behind and suppressed. Only the desire for form remains, hence it is called the form realm. Question: In the formless realm, why is it called "formless"? Answer: Because the desire for form has already been abandoned, it is called formless. Question: When speaking of "formless," is it formless because it lacks karmic resultant form, or is it also formless because it lacks meditative resultant form? Answer: There is meditative resultant form. Because there is no karmic resultant form, it is called the formless realm. Question: If so, since meditative resultant form also exists there, shouldn't it be called the form realm? Answer: Since there is already no karmic form, it is called formless. Question: Since meditative form exists, shouldn't it be called the form realm? Answer: The three realms are divided into three based on karma. Therefore, they receive their realm names based on karmic results. If we discuss their essence, all three realms take the ālaya-vijñāna as their fundamental nature. The four kinds of essential analysis can be known as usual. Distinguishing characteristics means: first distinguishing the characteristics of the desire realm, next distinguishing the characteristics of the form realm, then distinguishing the formless realm. Distinguishing the characteristics of the desire realm: the desire realm has thirty-six places in total. That is, there are six places in heaven, twelve places on earth, and eighteen places underground. Combined, there are thirty-six places. The six heavenly places are: first, the Heaven of the Four Great Kings; second, the Heaven of the Thirty-three; third, the Yāma Heaven; fourth, the Tuṣita Heaven;

fifth, the Heaven of Transformation of Pleasures; sixth, the Heaven of Others' Transformations. The twelve earthly places are the four great continents and eight intermediate continents. The four great continents are: first, Eastern Videha; second, Southern Jambudvīpa; third, Western Godānīya; fourth, Northern Kuru. The eight intermediate continents are: Eastern Videha has two intermediate continents, Southern Jambudvīpa has two intermediate continents, Western Godānīya has two intermediate continents, Northern Kuru has two intermediate continents. Combined, there are eight intermediate continents. The names of the intermediate continents are as follows. These four great continents all have humans and animals, so they constitute separate places. From this separation, there are five hundred small continents. Some small continents have people, some have no people at all, some have only spirits and demons, some have only animals. Therefore, they are not counted as separate places. Speaking of eighteen places underground: below this earth there are eight hot hells, also eight cold hells, also dwelling places of hungry ghosts, also dwelling places of asuras. Combined, there are eighteen places. These thirty-six places are collectively called the desire realm. Question: How are these four great continents arranged? Answer: There is Mount Sumeru. Ancient people called it Mount Meru. This mountain is exactly 168,000 yojanas in length and width. 84,000 yojanas extend underground into the sea, and 84,000 yojanas rise above ground from the sea, towering high and majestic. Surrounding this mountain are seven golden mountains. The first golden mountain is called Double-Holding Mountain, the second golden mountain is called Obstacle Mountain, the third golden mountain is called Horse-Ear Mountain, the fourth golden mountain is called Good-Sight Mountain, the fifth golden mountain is called Eave-Wood Mountain, the sixth golden mountain is called Axis-Holding Mountain, the seventh golden mountain is called Nimindhara Mountain. The first golden mountain is half the height of Mount Sumeru. The remaining six golden mountains successively decrease by half. Outside Mount Sumeru and the seven golden mountains are the four great continents and eight intermediate continents. Eastern Videha is shaped like a half-moon. Southern Jambudvīpa is shaped like a cart-box. Western Godānīya is perfectly round like a full moon. Northern Kuru is square-shaped. The facial features of people in these four great continents and eight intermediate continents resemble the shape of their respective continents. Question: What are the dimensions of these four great continents? Answer: The eastern and western continents are the same size, 7,500 yojanas each. The southern continent measures 6,500 yojanas. The northern continent measures 8,000 yojanas. Question: Why are the four continents not equal in size? Answer: The south commits many evil acts, so that land is narrow. The east and west commit fewer evil acts, so their land dimensions are equal. The north commits the least evil, so the land dimension is broad. Question: What are the names of the eight intermediate continents, each following the four continents? Answer: The two eastern intermediate continents are called Deha and Videha. These mean "victory" and "victorious body." The two southern intermediate continents are called Cāmara and Avaracāmara. These mean "yak-tail" and "superior yak-tail." The two western intermediate continents are called Śaṭha. This means "deceit." Also called Uttaramantriṇa. This means "superior discussion." The two northern intermediate continents are called Kurupa and Kaurava. These mean "superior border" and "superior border." The reasons for these names each have separate origins, as in the Yogācāra commentary. Question: Among these four continents, eight intermediate continents, and five hundred small continents, which continent and which place do we now inhabit? Answer: In the southern continent there are two intermediate continents. Among the two intermediate continents, the Cāmara continent corresponds to the country of Japan. Question: How is this determined? Answer: Since

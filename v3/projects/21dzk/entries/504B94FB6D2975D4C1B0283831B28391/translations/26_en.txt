**Chapter 3 of the Mahāyāna Yogācāra Research Divine Text**

**Upper Section**
Is it that granting the two and granting the ox are both equally unreal, and what is given later is real?

Q: "Are there sūtra passages that speak of four vehicles?"
A: "In the Lotus Sūtra, there is no such text at all. Though there is no explicit text, the meaning includes four."

Q: "Since there is already no text in the sūtra, saying that the meaning exists is merely false speech."
A: "The Yogācāra-śāstra explains that there is the doctrine of four vehicles. Adding the elephant to the three—this is explicit text."

Q: "That treatise's intention is different. It uses the four vehicles to metaphorically represent the four virtues of nirvāṇa, not to represent omniscience."

Q: "If there is no explicit text but the doctrinal meaning includes the four vehicles doctrine, what is that doctrinal meaning?"

Establishing the four vehicles doctrine: In Tang China there are four wise virtuous masters: first, Master Yun of Guangzhai Temple; second, Master Zhiyi of Tiantai Mountain; third, Master Fazang; fourth, Master Huiyuan. In the divine realm of Japan there is one wise virtuous one, named Prince Shōtoku. Together there are five masters. They establish these four vehicles. What they establish each has its reasoning. It's just that there is no explicit text—they only expound the doctrinal meaning. Other masters do not accept this doctrine.

Altogether there are five arguments. By this, separate from the three there is one vehicle. The teaching of three vehicles at the gate is provisional teaching of three vehicles; granting the white ox in the open ground is the real teaching of one vehicle. Since there are already provisional and real within the Mahāyāna, there are four vehicles. If not so, the children should each obtain vehicles upon exiting the house and need not seek further. Why do the three children all exit together and seek vehicles? Goat and deer are provisional—exiting the house they are not obtained. Therefore they exit and seek the ox vehicle, which is real. Why do they equally demand this after exiting? (Taking this as the first argument)

If what is granted at the four crossroads is the ox among the three, then those two children would naturally have no mind to obtain the great vehicle beforehand. If they meet unexpectedly, they would immediately observe with joy and say this was not their original

expectation. That great child should properly have no aspiration—why would he joyfully say it was not his original expectation? (Taking this as the second argument)

The sūtra text already says: "First using three vehicles to entice and advance the children, then afterward only giving the great vehicle." The Tathāgata is also thus—first explaining three vehicles to guide sentient beings, then afterward only using the great vehicle to liberate them. (Taking this as the third argument)

The sūtra text already says: "Within the one Buddha vehicle, separately explaining three." Since three are separately explained, together with the original Buddha vehicle, this clearly shows there are four. What separate one could be absent? (Taking this as the fourth argument)

The sūtra text also says: "When that Buddha appeared, though it was not an evil age, due to his original vow power, he taught the three vehicle Dharma." The meaning shown is that only due to evil ages or original vows are three vehicles taught—otherwise all Buddhas only teach that one. Clearly it is known that the great among the three is not the great of real teaching. (Taking this as the fifth argument)

With such five arguments they prove there are four vehicles. Among them, the first four are somewhat similar in what they say, but the fifth argument is not similar. How extremely laughable!

Meeting the first argument, they say: What is expected within the house is that outside the three realms there are three vehicle fruits. When reaching those fruits, all have omniscience. Therefore the children of the three vehicles each seek their own fruits, with the intention of expecting omniscience. However, the children of the two vehicles exit the three-realm house and obtain their own fruits. Having already reached fruition but lacking omniscience, they advance to seek it. The bodhisattva child, not yet having obtained the expected ultimate Buddha fruition, while in lower wisdom raises a mind of advancing seeking. If one obtains fruit but lacks wisdom, how light is the advancing mind! If fruit-wisdom is not yet obtained, how slow is the seeking mind! Therefore they all demand it. Shallowly taking the sūtra's meaning, mistakenly claiming to have grasped the principle—how is this not a mistake!

Meeting the second argument, they say: Practice has extensive and brief aspects. First showing the brief, by this exiting the house, now also granting the extensive, so it is not the original expectation. Also, when joy reaches the depths, calling it "not the original expectation" makes it the second

great. How extremely foolish!

Meeting the third argument, they say: First using three vehicle causes to make them cultivate three vehicle practices, now giving one vehicle fruit to make them cultivate one vehicle practice. Why make this the second great? How extreme!

Meeting the fourth argument, they say: In one ultimate fruit, explaining there are three causes. Also when saying "within one Buddha vehicle," there is only one and no three. When saying "separately explaining three," there is only three and no one. By what is it four? The fifth argument is not worth mentioning. By what do they harmonize?

Now, one who sees a wild pheasant and takes it for a phoenix not only does not know the phoenix, but also does not know the pheasant. One who sees autumn poplar leaves and takes them for gold arrows not only does not know gold arrows but also remains confused about poplar leaves. By what can this be remedied?

**Satyasiddhi School**

This treatise is one work in sixteen fascicles, or twenty-four fascicles, with 202 chapters. Though the number of fascicles differs, it is the same treatise. It was composed by Harivarman (this means "Lion Armor"). This treatise master appeared in the world from a Brahmin family in India more than 800 years after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa. With profound spiritual capacity and outstanding natural talent, harboring the way-leaves of a lofty age and wielding exceptional abilities, he became a monk in the Sautrāntika school. That Sautrāntika school emerged from the Sarvāstivāda school 400 years after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa, establishing their own doctrines based on the sūtras, hence called Sautrāntika. This treatise has two translations, both translated by Kumārajīva.

Q: "This treatise's fascicle count is indefinite—sometimes sixteen fascicles, sometimes twenty-four fascicles. Since it's Kumārajīva's translation, already being translated by one master, why is the fascicle count

**Lower Section**
indefinite?"

A: "The initial translation had no time for revision, so it circulated with an indefinite fascicle count. The later translation was finally complete when it circulated, hence the fascicle count is indefinite."

Q: "By what are the two versions distinguished as earlier and later translations?"

A: "Calling body, feeling, mind, and dharmas 'foundations of mindfulness' is the earlier version. Calling body, feeling, mind, and dharmas 'foundations of recollection' is the later version. Though there are differences of left and right, the essence is not different."

Q: "What is the spiritual level of this treatise master?"

A: "Among the four reliances, he is an initial reliance bodhisattva, with his stage before the [bodhisattva] grounds."

Q: "This person initially became a monk from non-Buddhist teachings. Why call him a bodhisattva?"

A: "The Tradition of the Dharma Treasury lists twenty-six dharma-transmission people, with the twenty-fifth person named Lion. That is precisely this treatise master."

Q: "There are many people in the world with the same name. This treatise master's name is precisely Lion Armor, but that dharma-transmission person is simply named Lion. Why are they the same person?"

A: "Not yet having obtained the wisdom eye, how can one maintain stubborn attachment? One can only tentatively identify that person."

Q: "This treatise text says 'the four subtle elements are the creators, the four great elements are the created.' Why does this contradict the Buddha-dharma in meaning?"

A: "This treatise master originally became a monk from within Sāṅkhya teachings, studying the doctrines originally learned. Not violating correct principle, he transmitted these doctrines."

Q: "What was the meaning of the doctrines originally established by those Sāṅkhya masters?"

A: "Those non-Buddhists said: The five types such as form are called 'five inferentials'—these are the creators. They create earth, water, fire, and wind. These earth, water, etc. create the eye and other sense organs. Though both creator and created are impermanent, they are not arising and ceasing but transformational impermanence. All have obstruction. Now this treatise master made the doctrines he originally studied into treatise text."

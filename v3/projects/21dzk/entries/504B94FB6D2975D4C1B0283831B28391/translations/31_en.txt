[Continuing from previous discussion] However, when citing lightning and jar, the energetic effort is absent in lightning. Why is this not a case of partial inability to establish? Through reasoning, the third explanation is obtained. 

**Question:** Among the indefinite [reasons], what is meant by "uncommon indefinite"? **Answer:** The "measurable" reason is absent in both lightning and jar, and absent in space. If so, how can sound be permanent? The reason is not pervasive in either similar or dissimilar cases. The meaning remains uncertain, hence it is indefinite.

**Question:** In which of the nine sentences is decisive contradiction included? **Answer:** It is included in the second and eighth correct reasons.

**Displaying the Establishment and Refutation Gate:** Establishment has two meanings: 1) one reason, two examples; 2) one reason, one example, two [aspects]. "One reason, two examples" concerns the three characteristics of reason. "One reason, one example, two [aspects]" concerns the reason and two examples.

**Question:** What are the three characteristics of reason? **Answer:** 1) Universal presence in the subject (the reason pervades the subject); 2) Definite presence in similar cases (the reason exists in similar examples); 3) Universal absence in dissimilar cases (the reason is absent in dissimilar cases).

When the reason lacks the first characteristic, there are four "non-establishment" fallacies. When the reason lacks the second characteristic, there are five "indefinite" fallacies (excluding decisive contradiction). When the reason lacks the third characteristic, there are four types of "contradictory" fallacies. Combined, there are fourteen fallacies of reasoning. Apart from these fourteen, it is called "true establishment."

**Lower Section:**
**Refutation** can be understood as before. When reasoning is free from the fourteen [fallacies], it is called "refutation." The examples also have ten fallacies: five for similar examples and five for dissimilar examples.

**Question:** The thesis is what is to be established. Does it have no fallacies? **Answer:** The thesis also has fallacies. When it is not a desirable thesis, there are many faults. It has five contradictions and four non-establishments, totaling nine faults.

The text then discusses the difference between ancient Buddhist logicians (who considered the thesis as part of "establishment") and Dignāga's system (where only the reason and examples constitute "establishment").

The discussion continues with technical details about logical fallacies and their classifications. The text then transitions to describe the famous Yogācāra syllogism established by Xuanzang during the Nālandā debate:

**"True conventional colors are not separate from eye-consciousness (thesis). Because they are admitted to be included in the first three [sense-fields] but not included in the present eye [sense-field] (reason). Just like eye-consciousness itself (example)."**

The text explains this was presented to refute the Small Vehicle schools' belief in the separation of mind and external objects, promoting instead the Yogācāra teaching that "only consciousness exists." The term "true" (zhen) is added as a qualifier to avoid the fallacy of contradicting common worldly understanding.

First, greedily desiring wealth without satisfaction; second, constantly seeking much but not according to one's wishes. The two results of anger are: first, constantly having others seek one's faults; second, constantly being troubled and harmed by others. The two results of wrong views are: first, constantly being born in families with wrong views; second, the mind being constantly deceitful and crooked. Thus each of the ten evils possesses five kinds of retributions—namely, the suffering results of the three evil paths and the two kinds of habitual tendency retributions in the human realm.

Question: Having already understood the two results of ripening and concordant effects, what should be known about dominant results? Answer: Due to practicing killing and so forth, the external resultant effects have little luster, fruits are not full, fruits often decay and spoil, fruits often change and deteriorate, fruits often fall and scatter, fruits lack sweet flavor, fruits are insufficient, fruits are inconvenient, and there is emptiness without fruit. These are called dominant results. The principle of cause and effect of these ten evils is both broad and deep. Fearing weariness with verbose text, a brief portion is revealed.

Question: How does one abandon such ten evils? Answer: First one should make vows. The words of the vow are as follows:

For the sake of all sentient beings in the dharma realm, I aspire to the supreme bodhi
Bodhi has no affliction and no burning troubles—it is what the wise delight in
Though I have not yet achieved liberation, I first liberate others, therefore I forever abandon the ten evil karmas

Question: Having abandoned these ten evils, how does one cultivate the ten virtues? Answer: The vow verses say:

From this body until Buddha body, throughout endless future I will not kill
May all sentient beings obtain long life, free from illness, peaceful and happy, all according to their hearts

From this body until Buddha body, throughout endless future I will not steal
May all sentient beings obtain prosperity, with all treasures freely, all according to their hearts

From this body until Buddha body, throughout endless future I will not commit sexual misconduct
May all sentient beings obtain upright minds, with true and virtuous companions, all according to their hearts

From this body until Buddha body, throughout endless future I will not speak falsely
May all sentient beings be praised, their words trusted and accepted, all according to their hearts

From this body until Buddha body, throughout endless future I will not speak divisively
May all sentient beings obtain firm bodies, with indestructible good friends, all according to their hearts

From this body until Buddha body, throughout endless future I will not speak harshly
May all sentient beings obtain pure karma, with beautiful and wonderful words, all according to their hearts

From this body until Buddha body, throughout endless future I will not speak frivolously
May all sentient beings obtain wisdom, with dignity respected by humans and gods, all according to their hearts

From this body until Buddha body, throughout endless future I will abandon greed
May all sentient beings obtain freedom, with rare and wonderful things, all according to their hearts

From this body until Buddha body, throughout endless future I will abandon anger
May all sentient beings obtain joyful hearts, dignified and respected, all according to their hearts

From this body until Buddha body, throughout endless future I will abandon wrong views
May all sentient beings obtain deep faith, with merit and wisdom ever increasing, all according to their hearts

I now sincerely abandon the ten evils, throughout endless future without violation
With these good roots I give to sentient beings, may all sentient beings accomplish the ten virtues
Together dedicating toward the place of bodhi, quickly achieving supreme great bodhi

Briefly Revealing the Gate of the Three-Thousand-Fold Great Thousand

There exists the three-thousand-fold great thousand world system. First is the small thousand world, second is the medium thousand world, third is the great thousand world. Speaking of the small thousand world: one world is what one sun and moon illuminate. Taking this one world as one unit and making it a thousand units, there are a thousand suns and moons, a thousand Mount Sumerus, a thousand sets of four great continents, a thousand sets of eight intermediate continents, a thousand sets of eight hot hells, a thousand sets of eight cold hells, a thousand hungry ghost realms, a thousand asura realms, a thousand six-desire heavens, a thousand four dhyānas of the form realm, and four places of the formless realm. All these together constitute the small thousand world.

Speaking of the medium thousand world: taking the small thousand world as one unit and making it a thousand units, all this together is called the medium thousand world. Speaking of the great thousand world: taking the medium thousand world as one unit and making it a thousand units, all this together constitutes the great thousand world. Such a three-thousand-fold great thousand world system contains in total ten billion suns and moons, ten billion Mount Sumerus, ten billion four heavens below, and ten billion four great continents.

The Matter of the Middle Way

On the Consciousness-Only Teaching Being the Dharma Gate of Great Compassion

The contemplative practice of bodhisattvas recognizes existence as existence and non-existence as non-existence. This "existence" refers to what is realized by sagely wisdom—the realm beyond language. This is the two natures of dependent origination (paratantra) and perfect realization (pariniṣpanna). This "non-existence" refers to the explicable self-nature grasped by foolish beings. This is the imagined nature (parikalpita). Knowing that all delusory objects are non-existent, one does not grasp even a fraction. Knowing that all sacred objects exist, one does not abandon even a fraction. Not grasping even a fraction, one does not create superimposition. Not abandoning even a fraction, one does not create denial. Free from the two attachments, it is neither one-sidedly existent nor one-sidedly empty, neither existent nor non-existent. Therefore, words are exhausted and thought ceases.

The empty non-existence grasped by ordinary beings' deluded attachments and the true existence of the dependent and perfect natures realized by sages merge into one reality without separation. Since the existence of the dependent and perfect natures carries the non-existence of the imagined nature, how could it be one-sided existence? Therefore, one cannot say that all phenomena definitely exist. Since the non-existence of the imagined nature encompasses the existence of the dependent and perfect natures, how could it be one-sided emptiness? Therefore, one cannot say that all phenomena are empty and non-existent.

It is like black and white water mixing together—though the two sides are distinct, their essence is one substance. It is neither only black nor only white. White is black, black is white. It cannot be called black, cannot be called white. Such designations are expressible inexpressibility, because they still explain the cause of the inexpressible. Therefore, this is called the middle way of the gate of explanation. Transcending this stage and completely abandoning designations, being neither existent nor non-existent—this is called the middle way of abandoning explanation and transcending language.

Now, in what position are we, and what kind of mind do we generate? We must know our own capacity and distinguish the true and false in our objects of cognition. Being already bound by all fetters as foolish beings, what we generate is tainted delusory emotion. We should know that everything appearing in our minds cannot be grasped. Neither existence nor emptiness is correct. "Neither" means non-existence, and non-existence is emptiness. Contemplating this emptiness is precisely consciousness-only contemplation, because it transcends all external objects, whether existent or non-existent, mental or material. External objects are nothing other than appearances to our current emotions, and those emotions are nothing other than our own minds.

Here we understand that when people cultivate prajñā (wisdom), emptying both the characteristics of existence and the characteristics of emptiness, this too can be called consciousness-only contemplation. When people contemplate consciousness-only, eliminating the grasped and the grasper, this too can be called the gate of prajñā. If prajñā is not consciousness-only, it cannot be true prajñā and will remain stuck in emptiness. If consciousness-only is not prajñā, it cannot be true consciousness-only and will remain stuck in existence. This merely points to the one principle of the inconceivable, naming it prajñā and naming it consciousness-only. In true nature, there are no two sides at all. Yet those who do not speak find it hard to transcend speech, and those who do not think—how can they reach non-thinking?

Therefore, in discussing this true nature, Qingbian explains it as emptiness while Dharmapāla explains it as existence. Both sages' teachings have inner realization and benefit. If one explains it as existence, sentient beings increasingly generate attachment to superimposition and create delusion and karma. If one explains it as existence, dharma-nature remains in existence and it is difficult to manifest transcendence of language. If one explains emptiness, emptying existence and emptying emptiness, one transcends all delusory attachments and enters the dharma-nature beyond language. Therefore, this true nature is the ultimate of non-existence. Entering this gate, everything without exception is prajñā. This is Qingbian's intention.

If one explains it as emptiness, one falls into the attachment of nihilistic denial, and saṃsāra has no limit. If one explains it as emptiness, dharma-nature remains in emptiness and it is difficult to manifest the middle way. If one explains existence, establishing both existence and emptiness, one transcends the delusion of two extremes and enters the true nature beyond language. Therefore, this dharma-nature is the ultimate of non-emptiness. Entering this gate, everything without exception is consciousness-only. This is Dharmapāla's intention.

Qingbian recommends the gate of great wisdom, while Dharmapāla also teaches the gate of great compassion. The former contemplates emptiness to elicit non-discriminating wisdom; the latter permits existence to generate fierce compassionate vows. That is the gate of entering principle, using emptiness as the gate to enter the one reality. This is the gate of dharma characteristics, using existence as the foundation to establish the hundred dharmas. Such designations represent the real distinction between two gates. Both one and two are real. However, we have already entered the school of Dharmapāla, studying the subtle principle of consciousness-only middle way, taking this as real and as fundamental. In the natural karmic connections and bonds of many lifetimes, how could there be no reason? If I have Buddha-nature, I must achieve liberation through this gate. If I reach the bodhisattva stage, I must become a compassion-enhanced bodhisattva.

Therefore, the great patriarch of our school, Maitreya the Compassionate One, from his initial arousal of the aspiration for enlightenment, even his vow not to eat meat truly nourishes the inner realization of consciousness-only samādhi. The great deity Kasuga who protects our school, with the epithet of compassionate myriad practices, deeply generates divine consideration for protecting the Dharma Characteristics school. If so, those who enter this school should make compassion their foundation. The beginning of this compassion need not necessarily be deep and broad. One handful of charity, one moment of pity—why harbor timidity? Practicing in this way, one can eventually reach the limitless. A thousand-mile journey begins with a single step; high mountains arise from tiny particles of dust. Who could immediately reach depth and breadth from their very first practice? Therefore, it is better to encounter circumstances according to one's capacity, not discussing shallow or deep, not disliking much or little, and generate the intention of compassion.

Generally, the cultivation of bodhisattvas takes compassion as primary. The bodhi-mind is simply compassion. Therefore, the Avataṃsaka Sūtra says: "Just as diamond arises from the nature of gold and not from other jewels, the jewel of bodhi-mind is also like this—it arises from the nature of great compassion protecting sentient beings, not from other good acts." Also, the Great Master's commentary says: "Bodhi is established through compassion, therefore one can endure all sufferings in saṃsāra." Such passages cannot be fully enumerated. That the youth Sudhana received the dharma gate of great compassion at Maitreya's place appears in the Avataṃsaka Sūtra. This is consciousness-only. This should be investigated. Know that the dharma gate of great compassion is consciousness-only.

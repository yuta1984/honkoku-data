Among the two characteristics, what is partially lacking is called one characteristic and is termed "indeterminate." What lacks both characteristics is called "four contradictions." This is not an exhaustive theoretical explanation. It is not a case where the before and after contradict and harm each other. According to the actual principle, there exists "both parties' non-establishment" combined with other faults as well.

The Myōtōshō states: Daiken says that although there is no complete fault, we now discuss partial "both parties' non-establishment." There is partial indeterminate contradiction. For example, when establishing "all sounds are permanent, because they are produced by effort and exertion, like sound-nature, etc." It is commonly accepted that this reason does not exist in external sounds. If it exists in internal sounds, there are two faults. If the positive example is permitted, it becomes indeterminate due to the jar. If there is no positive example, it is contradictory. According to this interpretation, the commentator agrees as well. Now, regarding the complete aspect, we make this explanation. These meanings are quite difficult to contemplate.

The original text states:
Kyūju first year, twelfth month, second day. Completed the annotation at Hōshaku-bō. Gōken.
Kempō third year, late May. Using the original manuscript, personally copied it. Employed fellow dharma practitioner Ryōshun-in to make copies. This commentary was drafted when the Tsubosaka Provisional Head Priest received oral transmission from the late Bodai-in Honorary Head Priest during the Jion-e formal debate. There was an instruction that the essence of the transmission could be understood through this, and it was personally bestowed from Hōshaku-in. It is precious and should not be shown to outsiders.

Question: What is the "particular-universal correspondence"?
Answer: There are two traditions. One is the same as the inner sciences. The second differs from the inner sciences, taking the subject (dharmin) as particular/self-substance and the predicate (dharma) as universal/differentia. The latter is superior because it accords with the commentary's text "namely our self-nature" and also accords with cutting through the fourfold correspondence.

Question: Regarding the latter tradition, how do particular-universal and before-after differ?
Answer: Particular-universal takes the subject as self-nature and the predicate as differentia. Before-after takes the subject as "that which is differentiated" and the predicate as "that which differentiates." Therefore, the two correspondences are distinct.

Self-question: In the commentary's section on particular-universal correspondence, why is there no text about "indeterminate naming"?
Answer: Although the text about indeterminate naming is in the before-after correspondence section, this text also encompasses the particular-universal correspondence. Therefore, the commentary's later text says, "reasoning through logic, although this is the same as before."

Question: Must particular-universal correspondence and before-after correspondence exist in one complete inference?
Answer: They must necessarily exist.

Question: In the before-after correspondence, when quoting the Buddhabhūmi-śāstra saying "that treatise on logic's particular characteristics and universal characteristics, etc.," does this prove the correspondence in question?
Answer: It proves it.

Question: What treatise is the "logic treatise"? Answer: The Nyāyapraveśa.
Question: What text is it? Answer: The text "furthermore, taking it as self," etc.
Question: Does one apply the subject to direct perception and the predicate to inference? Answer: No. Within the inference gate, one takes the subject as self-nature and the predicate as differentia.

Self-question: Can taking "that which differentiates" and "that which is differentiated" as the before-after correspondence be seen in the Nyāyapraveśa?
Answer: Yes. The text "relying on various characteristics to observe meaning" is this.

Question: Who is the opponent of dharma-particular-characteristics? Answer: The Vaiśeṣika school.
Question: How about the Zuanyo's text "not permitting the correspondence to permit existence"?
Answer: It is like the interpretation in Ō's private record by Sanshō Shin'e.

Question: How about the Enshū's text "domain dragon, what then"? Answer: This text provisionally explains the meaning that shared inference's disagreement with others is not a fault. "And about to use this reason" etc. separately explains the sixth indeterminate. It does not discuss the nine-case analysis.

Question: Does the "produced by effort and exertion" reason have the fault of partial inability to establish?
Answer: There are two traditions. One says it exists but is not a fault. The second says it doesn't exist. The latter tradition is considered superior.
Question: How does it not exist? Answer: Because lightning is abandoned during the combined method, this fault does not exist.

Question: Can the reason in the Śataśāstra "awareness is also not thought, because this is impermanent" be differentiated?

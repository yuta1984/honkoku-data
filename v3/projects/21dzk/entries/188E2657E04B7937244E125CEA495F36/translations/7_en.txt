Moreover, seeing the judgment text, among the four oppositions produced by the logical gate, the first substance-attribute opposition is precisely the inner teaching's substance-attribute opposition《etc.》Reaching the next section below, the logic's substance-attribute opposition is precisely the limited-universal opposition《etc.》Thus we know: is this present limited-universal opposition the inner teaching's substance-attribute opposition? If so, why determine them as separate?

Answer: First, these present three levels all discuss this within the inference-establishment gate. Therefore it says "this thesis expounds dharma." The judgment's four types are also like this. These all judge within inference-establishment. Why would one say that logic's inherent nature-differentia are not established within inference but are generally fixed? The previous masters' judgments are probably not so in principle. Already the judgment text explains "this present limited-universal substance," saying that otherwise there would be no analogy, no completion of inference, immediately named as fallacious《etc.》Here we know: is the first level also the inference-establishment gate? Moreover, the text already says "what is established and what establishes." Why would it not be inference-establishment? However, regarding "limited-universal and before-after are each separate": this principle is already evident. In one complete inference, when establishing "self is thought," self does not penetrate to non-self but is limited-attached to self's own substance, named inherent nature. Thought penetrates to non-self analogies, not limited to self's own substance but penetrating-through other dharmas, named differentia. This is the limited-universal opposition. Before-after refers to: the previous statement "self" is what is differentiated, having no dharma to differentiate; the later statement "thought" is what differentiates, differentiating the previous statement "self." Differentia is another name for differentiation. Therefore the previous statement is named inherent nature, the later statement named differentia. Therefore these two doctrinal gates have especially distinct principles and should not seek otherwise. Next, in the commentary text, reaching the before-after opposition and producing the doctrine of unfixed naming is to distinguish the Buddha-Ground Treatise's explained svarūpa-sāmānya, not saying there is no such doctrine in the first opposition. However, regarding the judgment text, like the Yellow Private Commentary, does it interpret taking substance as inherent nature and meaning as differentia as one side being identical? However, if like this doctrine, the judgment's first substance-meaning would have the fault of narrow limitation, not encompassing the side of taking substance as differentia and meaning as inherent nature. Or perhaps in a small portion? However, now examining and saying: the judgment's logic first opposition is precisely the limited-universal opposition, with no further broad-narrow distinction. Naming it "substance-meaning" is because even though it is impermanence-meaning, it attaches to own-substance's impermanence. Otherwise, there would be dharmas not encompassed by the judgment's four oppositions. However, the previous first judges this in name, not that the meaning is immediately identical. In inner teaching's meaning, obtaining the name substance-meaning is because it is limited-attached to one's own substance. Therefore there is no contradiction. The above doctrine of logic and inner teaching being separate has transmission from previous masters, quite having received inheritance.《Former master Keisuke already lectured》Like what is commonly studied, it is truly difficult to avoid doubt and confusion. Extremely profound. Should be kept secret, should be kept secret. However, youthful handwriting has many errors. Seeing this in old age, would it be difficult to transmit to future generations?

The Monastic Director says: My humble opinion also agrees with this meaning. The limited-universal opposition generally fixes the established total aggregate of various dharmas in logic. It does not yet reach the three-part methodology. However, the way it differs from inner teaching's inherent nature-differentia is the same as the master's teaching. Question: Why say it does not yet reach the three-part methodology? Answer: The commentary explaining the before-after opposition says: "Second, before-after: within the total aggregate, what is called previous statement is named inherent nature, what is called later statement is named differentia"《etc.》That total aggregate is the limited-universal opposition. Namely, logic's total aggregate of various dharmas. It has not yet become the time of inference-establishment. Question: The judgment says: "Third, logic's two aspects are divided according to universal-limited; using what later-taught necessarily penetrates others,

【Lower Section】
otherwise there is no analogy, no completion of inference, immediately named fallacious"《etc.》This is text explaining the limited-universal opposition. Already saying "not completing inference," how can one say "not reaching the time of inference-establishment"? Answer: This text jointly explains the limited-universal and before-after two oppositions. It does not explain only the limited-universal.

○ Before-After Opposition《In our own doctrine, the Buddha-Ground Treatise text serves as proof》
Question: How does the Buddha-Ground Treatise text become proof text for the before-after opposition? Answer: Because the previous opposition does not yet reach inference-establishment, this text does not serve as proof. Because this opposition speaks of the time of three-part methodology, it serves as proof. Because this text explains the inference-establishment gate. Also, because this opposition also has limited-universal meaning, the text about limited-attached inherent nature is not its proof.

Question: What treatise and what text is the logic treatise? Answer: The Small Treatise's text "inference means relying on aggregate characteristics to observe meaning." Question: Does one correspond svarūpa to direct perception and sāmānya to inference? Answer: Both svarūpa and sāmānya correspond to inference.

Question: "Penetrating through others' surface" like thread penetrating flowers - what does this point to when not being sāmānya? Answer: This points to the reason. It does not point to the thesis-predicate.

Question: This is text explaining the thesis's before-after. How can one say it points to the reason? Answer: The treatise says: "Speaking of inference means relying on aggregate characteristics to observe meaning; characteristics have three types as already explained above"《etc.》That logic treatise is precisely this text. This text explains the reason's sāmānya. Citing this, one should not explain the thesis's sāmānya. Also, the commentary's next section below says: "Therefore, relying on this, sound etc.'s limited substance is named inherent nature,

【Lower Section】
impermanence penetrating others does not become differentia"《text》Therefore we know: citing the Buddha-Ground Treatise text uses the reason's sāmānya as analogy to accomplish the matter of the thesis-predicate's sāmānya. Therefore "relying on this" - "relying" means "according to."

○ Explicit Statement-Intended Meaning Opposition《The Monastic Director says there are no specific matters》
Inquiring: In this present explicit statement-intended meaning opposition's intention, should differentia be permitted to penetrate explicit statement svarūpa? If one permits this, is there the fault of explicit-intended confusion? If not, why does the judgment say "not obstructing svarūpa, also having intended meaning penetrating explicit statement"?

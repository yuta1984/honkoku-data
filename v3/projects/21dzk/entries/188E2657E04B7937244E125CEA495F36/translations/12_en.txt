Discussing this doctrine. Also, why would great existence separately have capable-cognition apart from substance etc.? If again naming the nature that causes to have cognition as "capable-cognizing nature," this also cannot be so. Because it contradicts the decisive text. Namely, the text says: "If one says great existence is the object-nature of mind that cognizes great existence《etc.》now we dispute that great existence and capable-cognizing mind create object-nature"《etc.》. Thus we know that creating capable-cognizing nature means great existence separately has capable-cognition itself. Adding to this, the Myōtō-shō says: "One must further separately establish great existence sentence-meaning as object of mind"《etc.》. Also, wouldn't the challenge by analogy with sound's capable-cognizing nature etc. in the later text be contradictory? Because that has its own cognition. Moreover, how should the interpretation of "creating cognizing nature" be explained?

Above copied and written from the Monastic Director's excerpts.

Question: What is your own doctrine? Undetermined. But should one rely on the decisive text?

○ The commentary says: "Great existence, similarity-difference have capable-cognizing nature, same indicating words are each separate, therefore that is not taken."

This is Eichō Monastic Director's topic.

○ Creating non-capable-cognizing nature substance

Substance etc., the five sentences. 《The Compilation says: "Question: Do substance etc. five sentences obtain the name 'non-non existence'? Answer: Although saying 'non-non,' they are not named 'existence'"《etc.》. Is this text evidence? Not certain.》

Precisely doctrinal contradiction.

Among these two transmissions, scholars should accept or reject according to their judgment.

○ One cause violates three

Inquiring: The explained existence-nature is great existence-nature. Since it is Vaiśeṣika's self-inference, why examine the implied meaning of "creating non-existence-nature capable-cognizing nature" below?

Answer: 《Monastic Director》The explained existence-nature challenges its substance. The verbal expression "existence-nature separate from substance" does not say "great existence-nature." To show the method of compound inferences, examining faults generally.

Question: What is compound inference? Answer: Violating two, violating three, violating four - these are compound inferences. Violating one is simple inference.

○ "All remaining dharmas enter the same example, no indeterminate fault"《etc.》.

Kojima's interpretation. 《Based on the Lamp Commentary》"All remaining dharmas" means child-grandchild atoms.

The same private record asks: In logic's method, when establishing a thesis, things that should become similar instances naturally become similar instances. Things that should become dissimilar instances naturally become dissimilar instances. Taking dissimilar instance things as similar instances cannot establish similar instances. Taking similar instance things as dissimilar instances cannot establish dissimilar instances. The two classes of similar and dissimilar naturally have no confusion. Then if child-grandchild etc. should become dissimilar instances, knowing they are said to "all enter the same example," how could they conversely become similar instances? If originally they should become similar instances, what labor is there in saying "all enter the same example"? How is this not useless? Answer: Exactly so. Reaching contradictory things like water and fire, without waiting for words to determine, they naturally become similar or dissimilar instances. However, since they have the four elements as substance, there is temporarily the meaning that they could become dissimilar instances. Therefore, if one does not say "all

enter the same example," opponents could take the aspect of having four elements as substance, establish them as dissimilar instances, and create indeterminate faults. To prevent this confusion, one says "all enter the same example." 《In the consciousness-only inference, there are applicable cases. Should be examined.》

The Monastic Director says: Taking the similar example of the two vehicles' fruit inference, this can temporarily serve as an example. That original inference says:

"The two vehicles' fruit should have determined nature, because of being what the vehicle addresses, like the great vehicle practitioners"《etc.》. This inference includes indeterminate nature in the similar example. Therefore there is no indeterminate fault.

Inquiring: Is there an example of child-grandchild atoms not entering the four great elements?

○ One cause violates four

Question: First, including similarity-difference and conjunction, the two sentences, both entered into the thesis-subject, how is this? Generally observing the five peaks' spiritual capacity and response, although teaching the six-sentence dharma gate, for substance etc. three sentences, they understand upon one hearing. Reaching the great existence sentence, they frequently generate mental confusion. Like saying "substance-quality-action nature's non-non is precisely the capable-haver." Therefore, disputes arise between teacher and student, arguing about capable-having in immediate difficulty. Eventually establishing three inferences, when determining the two classes of similar and dissimilar, making substance etc. three sentences similar instances, taking similarity-difference nature as similar instances completed. Therefore now again, when establishing having separate self-nature apart from substance etc., with quality-action two sentences, they should particularly enter the thesis-subject. Why include similarity-difference and conjunction, saying there is "lack of thesis similar instances"? Then the cause "because of permitting non-non" eventually commits shared indeterminate fault. In similarity-difference two instances, both are pervasively present. Then one should not examine dharma-svabhāva faults.

Answer: The general purport of the challenge all appears in the commentary text. No need for strenuous effort. Restating the challenge's meaning: Generally

【Lower Section】

examining the seven virtues' spiritual capacity, when broadly teaching the six-sentence teaching gate, apart from substance etc. five sentences, separately establishing great existence-nature. Therefore similarity-difference and conjunction, the two sentences, are all dissimilar instances of great existence. However, when the teacher transmits the existence-sentence but students frequently do not believe, explaining similarity-difference and conjunction, artificially making them capable-establishing similar examples, raising dissimilar instances as similar instances. This is already the expedient of artificial establishment. Due to this, in this present inference, when students examine faults, they take similar examples as dissimilar instances, both entering the thesis-subject. Already lacking the latter two characteristics, committing contradiction faults. Therefore the commentary says: "However, those five peaks《etc.》same and pervasive non-existence"《etc.》. Then when similarity-difference and conjunction two sentences all enter the thesis-subject, the cause "because of permitting non-non" has same without, different with, no longer turning to the two instances. Therefore there is no indeterminate fault. The commentary says: "Because similarity-difference enter within the thesis-subject, there is no indeterminate" - precisely this meaning.

Question: The reasoning is increasingly difficult to understand. The commentary's above text, clarifying teacher-student disputes, says: The teacher holds that apart from substance-quality-action three sentences there is separately the capable-having great existence-nature. The student holds that substance etc. nature's non-non is precisely the capable-having《etc.》. Here we know that originally, apart from substance etc. three sentences, they dispute the immediate-separate of capable-having. Why discuss the existence or non-existence of essential nature regarding similarity-difference and conjunction? Moreover, if disputing no separate self-nature apart from the five sentences, establishing three inferences, students should harbor doubts. Further adding similarity-difference and conjunction, five inferences should be established. Adding to this, regarding the present inference, when examining dharma-viśeṣa contradiction faults, under the dharma-thesis "having separate self-nature apart from substance etc.," there are the implied distinctions of "capable-having substance-quality-action separate from substance etc. existence-nature" and "not capable-having substance-quality-action separate from substance etc. existence-nature."

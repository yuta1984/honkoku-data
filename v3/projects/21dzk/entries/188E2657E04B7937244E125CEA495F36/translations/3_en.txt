The inference is victorious. This is because the power of present teaching is superior. Regarding the superiority of present teaching power, among the three explanations in the commentary, the third explanation is considered correct. This is because the sound theorist's inference contradicts the teaching of Akṣapāda, which is trusted by the world.

Question: Although contradictory determinants commit thesis-faults, do they still have this fault? Answer: The Yuiki states: "Although they commit thesis-faults, if the three characteristics are not lacking, why call them contradictory determinants? However, judging by reason, only when both thesis and reason completely avoid faults does this become this fault."

Question: What kind of thesis-fault is the sound theorist's "sound is eternal" inference?
Answer: It is contradiction with one's own teaching. Because it contradicts Akṣapāda's teaching.

Regarding the explanation in the Enpi, the reconciliation was stated previously. "Moreover, taking this reason in sound-Vaiśeṣika confrontation makes it indefinite" refers to outside the nine propositions. Question: The beginning and end of the text appears to be the second proposition. How should this be reconciled? Answer: If so, does the second proposition have true and false? This is not Cien's intention. Therefore, Xuanying's commentary first volume states: "It does not say that all eight are correct reasons." The Meitō-shō states: "Since there is no authentic text, it should not be relied upon."

○ Dharma-differentia intended meaning (self-doctrine of superior-inferior)
Provisional usage being inferior is not desired. Why? If the establisher takes true usage being superior as what is desired, then provisional usage being inferior should be what is not desired. However, the establisher only takes divine-self usage as

【Lower Section】
what is desired. Therefore, provisional usage, even if inferior, becomes what is not desired. Question: When creating the contradicting inference of provisional usage being superior, is the intended meaning of provisional usage being inferior also negated? Answer: Although inferior is negated, provisional usage is not negated. Therefore, the explicit statement of other-usage does not perish. This is because the intended meaning of divine-self usage includes both superior and inferior, and the intended meaning of provisional-other usage includes both superior and inferior. Therefore, the Duan states: "Although true-other does not establish other, since provisional-other is mutually accepted, it establishes that true-other does not use eyes, etc. Since provisional-other usage exists without contradicting explicit statement, it contradicts differentia."

Question: If so, how can we speak of superior-inferior intended meaning? Answer: Superior-inferior differentia means examining and revealing what Sāṅkhya accepts regarding eyes, etc. However, when creating contradicting inferences to prevent accordance, when saying "provisional-self other-usage is superior," within the original provisional-other usage intended meaning, the meaning of superiority is not lost. Therefore explicit statement does not perish. In other-usage explicit statement, both divine-self usage superior-inferior and provisional-self usage superior-inferior are complete. In eyes, etc. other-usage, divine-self usage superior and provisional-self usage inferior are accepted. The intended meaning differentia under dharma-thesis does not necessarily exist on the subject. This is like the analogy of four-divisions establishment. Intended meaning differentia and differentia-contradiction are each separate. Question: How are they separate? Answer: Differentia-contradiction necessarily involves true-other usage (superior-inferior) and provisional-other usage (superior-inferior) under for-other-usage. Intended meaning differentia involves true-usage superior and provisional-usage inferior under eyes, etc. necessarily for-other-usage. See the Jūshū-shō for details. Question: What about proof texts for superior-inferior? Answer: It is the text of "now Dignāga," etc.

Question: This text is intended meaning one-sided differentia. Answer: If so, when Buddhist disciples establish provisional-self

usage superior, they should accompany it with divine-self usage inferior. To say so would be laughable. Moreover, among various inferences, having two things each within two intended meanings has no precedent.

Also, Eichō's Seigi takes the text from Vijñaptimātratā-siddhi 70 "if one explains accumulated others, it commits the fault of accordance" as proof text for superior-inferior intended meaning. This is because on eyes, etc., one should not use provisional usage superiority doctrine. Question: What faults does the superior-superior tradition have?

Answer: It is slight progress.
The original plan of Sāṅkhya establishing the inference "eyes, etc. are necessarily for others' use" desires to reveal the doctrine that divine-self uses eyes, etc. If self as subject receives and uses eyes, etc.

The Zuanyo states: "Mutual non-establishment does not necessarily mean the subject definitely exists." The commentary states: "The two types of non-establishment - mutual and particular - have only dependent existence." This is post-Dignāga doctrine. If following ancient masters and heretics, the dependent subject of mutual non-establishment is universally absent. "Not necessarily subject definitely existing" accords with ancient masters.

○ Subject-svarūpa (self-doctrine: existence apart from substance exists in the subject position)
The commentary states: "What is established means thesis; dharma means predicate." What does this mean? Answer: What is established is the general thesis. Dharma is the predicate of the general thesis. Question: Regarding subject-svarūpa, why does svarūpa refer to general thesis? Answer: Regarding explicit statement inference, it is "existence is non-substantial." Regarding intended meaning inference, "existence apart from substantial existence" is the general thesis. Question: Why call it predicate?

【Lower Section】
Answer: Regarding explicit statement, it is "non-substantiality of existence." Regarding intended meaning, it is "existence apart from substantial existence." Question: The commentary states "the previous treatise explains it as established dharma." What is that established dharma? Answer: It is the predicate of non-separation nature. What is established is existence apart from substantial existence. Dharma here is existence apart from substance. Therefore Heihei states: "This non-separation thesis does not separate from the predicate, hence called established differentia."

Question: Does the inference "existence is existence apart from substance" have proof texts? Answer: It exists in Kojima's fellow-student private record. Also, Mingshendao in the lower commentary states: "Taking identity-difference nature as intended meaning existence apart from substance as positive analogy."

Question: The Duan states: "Saying 'non-substantial,' etc. means taking the doctrine of existence apart from substance, etc. as dharma; looking at this immediately contradicts what is established." How should this be reconciled? Answer: (The Master says: This text is difficult to understand.)

The next day, the Master came and said: "'Saying non-substantial,' etc. means taking the doctrine of existence apart from substance as dharma; looking at this immediately becomes what is established" means: explicitly stating "non-substantial" while intending to establish "existence apart from substantial existence." Looking at this, it becomes the desired established position. "Thus establishing subject through expedient means" means: using "non-substantial" statement as expedient means to establish that existence is existence apart from substantial existence.

Question: Where does that existence apart from substantial existence exist? Answer: In the inference "existence is non-substantial" without additional statement, it exists in the subject position. Therefore the following text states: "In relation to the unspeakable, it is called subject-svarūpa." This is because under the subject "existence," there is the inference "existence apart from substantial existence" with additional statement.

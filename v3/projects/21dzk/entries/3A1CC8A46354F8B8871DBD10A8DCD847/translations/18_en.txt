functions," how can it now be said that "sentient beings etc. have no function"? Explanation: Master Xing says, "Imagined construction nature serves as object-condition for other-dependent nature, causing them to combine and arise." Another explanation: achievement is called "generation" - through the realm of self and dharmas, other-dependent mental factors combine to accomplish delusion. Therefore, now saying "self etc. have no function" has slightly different meaning. Imagined constructions are not the same as jars etc. that have enjoyable functions. Therefore saying "no function" does not concern operational functions, so there is no contradiction. This principle should be contemplated.

Regarding the text "Second conventional... different from first conventional": This presents the substance of the second conventional rational truth. "Established aggregates, sense-bases, realms, etc." means provisionally establishing the five aggregates, twelve sense-bases, eighteen realms, twelve dependent origination, twenty-two faculties, etc. Because they are established according to principle, they are called "rational." Nirvāṇa also says etc. refers to text from chapter thirteen. The Nirvāṇa Sūtra passages quoted below are all from the same volume. "Namely conditioned and unconditioned dharma-substances etc." means among the three categories, the five aggregates are only conditioned, not encompassing unconditioned. In the sense-base and realm categories, one portion of dharma-base and dharma-realm are unconditioned, while the rest are all conditioned. Taking these conditioned and unconditioned dharmas as the substance of second conventional rational. "Having separate substance and function different from first conventional" clarifies the meaning of shallow-deep and superior-inferior. When compared to first conventional, it is deeper and superior, having substance therefore included in the second.

Regarding the text "Third conventional... called conventional": This presents the substance of third realization conventional truth. Manifestation chapter six says: "Realization conventional means establishing stream-enterer fruits etc. and establishing the Four Noble Truths which are the reason for the four śramaṇa fruits." Therefore called "realization conventional." "Basis" refers to Four Noble Truths principles. Some say: "Maturation body is the basis for conditioned non-different two fruits, the body of dependence. Because it abides through four foods, it is called their basis. Because these are provisionally established, it is called establishment" - this is incorrect. It contradicts Yogācāra treatise saying "Four Noble Truths principles are called realization conventional." "Having eight suffering characteristics called worldly truth": birth suffering, aging suffering, illness suffering, death suffering, separation from loved ones suffering, meeting with hated ones suffering, not obtaining what is sought suffering, five flourishing aggregates suffering. For questions and answers about the inclusion of three sufferings and eight sufferings, add explanations from treatise commentaries and other separate excerpts.

Regarding the text "Fourth conventional... having characteristics established": Yogācāra sixty-four says: "Furthermore, establishment briefly has four kinds: as previously explained - three kinds of conventional and establishing ultimate." Manifestation is also the same. Explanation: Therefore, ultimate truth nature cannot be established because it is inner realization. Only buddhas and bodhisattvas, through what they have realized, guide sentient beings to attain that true-suchness wisdom. Therefore, depending on conventional truth, they provisionally establish constructions, hence called "establishment." As previously explained, Nirvāṇa thirteen says: "If burning, if cutting, if death, if decay - this is called worldly truth. No burning, no cutting, no death, no decay - this is called ultimate meaning truth." Explanation: What can be burned, cut, etc. is called "worldly truth." Precisely regarding this, two selflessness meanings are called "fourth conventional." What has no burning, cutting, etc. is called "fourth ultimate." Two-emptiness true-suchness, though without burning and cutting, is manifested through designations. The name "no burning" exists only in fourth abandoning-designation discussing-essence. Therefore, the following text explaining fourth ultimate substance quotes evidence saying "no burning, cutting, etc. called ultimate meaning" - not manifesting truth through selflessness. From this we clearly know that names like "no burning" exist only in the fourth. This principle is mysterious and profound; scholars should contemplate it. The latter three conventional truths having characteristics

establishment: Fourth conventional truth, though characteristicless, is manifested through designations, therefore called "having characteristics."

Regarding the text "First ultimate... ultimate meaning truth": In first worldly ultimate truth, the reason aggregates etc. are called "ultimate" is that they have separate substance and function, superior to first conventional, therefore called "ultimate." "Having names and reality etc." means having names without reality is conventional, like jars, clothes, etc. Having names with reality is ultimate, like form, scent, etc. Aggregates, sense-bases, etc. are also ultimate. In second rational ultimate substance, Four Noble Truths are next deeper, superior to second rational conventional, therefore called "ultimate." Regarding "suffering, accumulation, cessation, path etc.," Nirvāṇa thirteen says: "These Four Noble Truths are explained by buddhas and world-honored ones in sequence. Through this causation, immeasurable sentient beings attain crossing over birth and death." Explanation: Sequential explanation has many kinds of sequence. First, arising sequence, like nine sequential concentrations etc. Second, explanation sequence, like four right efforts etc. Third, seeing sequence, like explaining Four Noble Truths. If cause-effect sequence, then first accumulation, then suffering; first path, then cessation. Now depending on seeing sequence, therefore first suffering, then accumulation; first cessation, then path. Becoming disgusted with effects and severing causes; delighting in effects and cultivating causes. Causes are hidden and difficult to recognize; effects are manifest and easy to know. Easy first, difficult later. When buddhas and world-honored ones create this sequence in explanation, immeasurable sentient beings attain crossing over birth and death.

Regarding the text "Third ultimate... called ultimate": In third realization ultimate, two-emptiness true-suchness is next deeper, superior to the previous third realization conventional, therefore called "realization ultimate." Consciousness-Only Treatise volume nine says: "Third realization ultimate means two-emptiness true-suchness." Now taking the meaning to quote, therefore saying "manifesting two-emptiness true-suchness through designation gates." Nirvāṇa thirteen says: "No birth, no aging, no illness,

no death, no separation from loved ones, no meeting with hated ones, no not obtaining what is sought, no five flourishing aggregates - this is called ultimate meaning truth." Now quoting briefly, therefore saying "absence of eight sufferings called ultimate meaning." "Generally observing dharmas as two selflessnesses etc." is the chapter master's explanatory text.

Regarding the text "Fourth ultimate... thereby manifesting truth": In fourth ultimate ultimate, one true dharma realm is most profound, superior to fourth ultimate conventional, therefore called "ultimate ultimate." Yogācāra sixty-four says: "What is non-established reality? It refers to true-suchness of dharmas." Nirvāṇa thirteen says: "Reality is precisely the Tathāgata. Tathāgata is precisely reality. Reality is precisely empty space. Empty space is precisely reality. Reality is precisely Buddha-nature. Buddha-nature is precisely reality." Explanation: One real true-suchness when bound is called "Buddha-nature"; when in fruition is called "Tathāgata." Dharma-nature empty suchness is called "empty space" because it is manifested through two emptinesses. However, in that sūtra, seven meanings generally explain the meaning of reality truth: first, reality; second, non-inversion; third, non-falsity; fourth, called Great Vehicle; fifth, spoken by Buddha; sixth, one path purity; seventh, having permanence, bliss, self, and purity. Through these seven meanings it is called "reality truth," as extensively explained in the sūtra. Now indicating the first meaning. Also saying "no burning, cutting, etc. called ultimate meaning" etc. - through this text we know that designation gate selflessness exists only in fourth conventional ultimate. The name "no burning, cutting" exists only in fourth one true dharma realm.

Regarding the text "Previous three ultimates... namely previous three ultimates": Previous three ultimates having characteristics establishment etc. - explaining differences according to four levels of ultimate. "First one conventional mind-external realms non-existent etc." - according to four conventional

"From 'Question: these two truths' to 'definitely same or definitely different'": This text is the chapter master's question. "The *Renwang Sutra* says, etc." refers to the text from the Two Truths chapter in the first fascicle of that sutra. "Wisdom should not be two" means knowing conventional is called "conventional wisdom," knowing ultimate is called "ultimate wisdom." If there were only one truth, wisdom should not be two. "Wisdom should not be one" means ultimate wisdom understands one and discusses the non-dual. If there are two truth wisdoms, it should not be one. "The *Nirvāṇa Sutra* says, etc." refers to the text from fascicle thirteen. "Explaining two truths in accordance with sentient beings" clarifies that the intention of explaining two truths is for sentient beings. Realization wisdom understands one, but provisionally establishes names and characteristics, and in accordance with sentient beings, explains that there are two truths. These two texts are both as explained before.

"From 'the first conventional' to 'namely excluding previous characteristics'": In the fourth phrase, saying "excluding previous characteristics" - Commentary fascicle one says: "That fourth phrase should be known as reversing the above, namely reversing the above third 'both' phrase. The meaning should be understood. What dharmas are taken as the fourth phrase? There are two explanations. One says: In the third phrase there are namely two meanings - so-called affirmation and negation. If affirming ultimate and conventional forms the third phrase, if negating ultimate and conventional is the fourth phrase. Namely because it's ultimate it's not conventional, because it's conventional it's not ultimate. Now saying 'excluding previous characteristics' means excluding the affirmative meaning of the third phrase. Therefore its negative meaning becomes the fourth phrase. How can this be known? In Ximing Commentary fascicle one's explanation, namely regarding the three phrases of imputing self etc. to aggregates, it asks: Logically there should be four phrases - why are there only three phrases without 'both identical and separate'? Explaining: 'Neither identical nor separate' is namely 'both identical and separate,' so it's not explained separately. What is this meaning? If affirming identity and separation forms the third phrase, if negating identity and separation is the fourth phrase. Namely because of identity it's not

separate, because of separation it's not identical. Therefore *Prakaraṇāryavāca*, *Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā*, etc. all make this explanation. The third and fourth phrases, though different by meaning, have no distinction in essence. However, this third phrase and fourth phrase sometimes have the same essence, sometimes different essence - understand according to this." The second explanation says: Taking the non-existence of original nature as the fourth phrase. How can this be known? *Nirvāṇa Sutra* fascicle 40 says: "Furthermore Gautama, worldly dharmas have two: first existence, second non-existence. Existence is space, non-existence is rabbit horns. These two dharmas - one is existent so doesn't depend on causes and conditions, two is non-existent so also doesn't depend on causes and conditions." Since it says "rabbit horns don't depend on causes and conditions," it's clearly known they're neither conventional nor ultimate. However, *Nirvāṇa Sutra* fascicle thirteen explaining the non-existence of rabbit horns etc. as "worldly truth" discusses shadow-non-existence, so there's no contradiction. Question: If so, why does the sutra say "worldly dharmas have two, namely space and rabbit horns etc."? Since it says "worldly dharmas," aren't they included in conventional? Explaining: The sutra discusses names, now we discuss essence, so there's no problem.

"From 'the fourth ultimate' to 'also called ultimate'": Below generally clarifies the meaning of establishing ultimate and conventional in opposition. Explaining this mutual dependence, *Pivotal Essentials* first fascicle says: "Briefly three categories: first, general and particular mutual dependence; second, particular and other mutual dependence; third, general and other mutual dependence." Extensively as explained there. In this chapter now, it marks the first pair, the rest are briefly not explained. Now saying "the fourth ultimate cannot be ultimate by itself, depending on the four conventionals therefore called ultimate, etc." is the first phrase among making four phrases through first general-particular mutual dependence. Therefore that text says: "First general-particular opposition should make four phrases. First, using conventional general opposed to ultimate particular has one phrase. The ultimate beyond the four conventionals has only the later one. This namely makes phrases by opposing established and non-established. 'The first conventional cannot be conventional by itself, depending on the four ultimates to be called conventional, etc.' is the second phrase among making four phrases through second general-particular opposition. Therefore that text says: 'Second, using conventional particular opposed to ultimate general, among having four phrases, the ultimate surpassing conventional is all four.'"

"From 'the first ultimate' to 'calling one ultimate conventional'": "The first ultimate depending on one conventional to be called superior" means using aggregate-dharmas etc. opposed to □-dharmas etc. to call them superior. Up to "the fourth ultimate depending on four conventionals to be called superior" means one true dharma-realm opposed to the four levels of conventional to call it superior. "The first conventional depending on four ultimates to be called conventional, etc." can be understood according to this. Extensively as in *Pivotal Essentials*.

"From 'therefore if there is conventional' to 'because of establishment'": This clarifies that ultimate and conventional don't separate from each other. Ultimate is not ultimate by itself - because it depends on conventional it's ultimate. Namely the former three ultimates are also explained as conventional. Conventional is not conventional by itself - because it depends on ultimate it's conventional. Namely the later three conventionals are also called ultimate. This meaning of mutually depending without separating is the meaning of ultimate and conventional. The non-elimination school, like Bhāviveka etc., doubly eliminates all conditioned and unconditioned. The second true-false coexistence school, like Dharmapāla etc., maintains the meanings of two truths, three natures, etc. Now refuting the former school, therefore it says "not eliminating other-dependent to realize perfect accomplishment, etc."

"From 'what is explained thus' to 'detailed and easy'": This clarifies that the intention of collecting two truths meanings is for later students. The text has two parts. First, from "what is explained thus" to "unable to elaborate extensively" clarifies that the merit of dharma transmission by various worthies of previous generations nearly benefits the present time. Later, from "Ji following the sequence of translation"

【Lower Section】
to "detailed and easy" describes that Master Ji's light of transmission illuminates later students from afar. "Briefly compiling what was heard" means former Master Yuan etc. used seven levels of sutras to explain the two truths of four schools. Now Mahāyāna-ji uses seven levels of sutras to match the two truths of four levels. Though the meanings transmitted by former worthies are acceptable, there are still deficiencies. Ji used what he heard to compile what was lacking in ancient times, therefore saying "briefly compiling what was heard." "Compile" is pronounced zi-huan, meaning to continue. "Later further consulting and examining" means receiving the Tripiṭaka's explanations and thoroughly examining the profound school, therefore saying "later further consulting and examining." "Consult" is pronounced zi-ci. *Zuo Commentary* says "inquiring about good is called consulting." Du Yu said: "Asking about the good path." *Erya* says "consulting means planning." "Compile" is pronounced bi-mian, meaning to arrange, to weave, also to connect in sequence.

"From 'can be called lofty in meaning' to 'only Heshi's jade disc'": This clarifies that the explained profound meaning is beyond comparison. Ultimate and conventional two truths have been clarified by past and present, but making them into four levels has never been heard of. This new profound meaning is truly worthy of praise, therefore saying "can be called meaning loftier than a thousand years, etc." "Thousand years" is another name for a thousand years. Supreme principle is profound and mysterious, increasingly verified by this. How could praise and chanting suffice to express joyful feelings? Therefore saying "praise, chant, intone, and recite, etc." "Echoing Boya's zither, etc." describes the excellence and inferiority of transmission benefits. Examining *Lü's Spring and Autumn*, it says: "Boya played the zither, Zhong Ziqi listened. When Boya's intention was on Mount Tai, Zhong Ziqi said: 'Excellent! Lofty like Mount Tai.' In a moment when his intention was on flowing water, Ziqi said: 'Excellent! Vast like flowing water.' When Ziqi died, Boya broke his zither and severed the strings, never playing again for the rest of his life."

belongs to the third. "The third inclusion" means that the principles of the Four Noble Truths that appear transformed in consciousness do not separate from phenomena. They belong to dependent origination. "Three clarifying conventionals" means: when the contaminated dependent nature is severed, the imagined nature becomes non-existent. Taking the two emptinesses as gates to reveal suchness is called perfect accomplished reality. Among the four conventionals, it is the fourth conventional. Or this conventional also includes the third among the four. Because it is uncontaminated. They correspond to the three natures in sequence. The Xianzang Treatise also has this passage.

"From 'its meaning-ultimate meaning' to 'because the treatises themselves explain'": The first meaning-ultimate meaning is a dependent-head compound. It belongs to the fourth ultimate meaning. The second attained ultimate meaning is namely nirvāṇa. This is an appositional compound. It belongs to the third ultimate meaning inclusion. Because it is revealed through realization, and because it is discussed in terms of attainment. Since suchness is originally accomplished, it is not called attainment. Nirvāṇa appears later, therefore the name "attainment" is established. The third active ultimate meaning belongs to the second ultimate meaning inclusion. Because the principle is somewhat superior. If following phenomena, it is also the first ultimate meaning. Taking superior dharma as meaning is a possessive compound. The old Madhyāntavibhāga calls it "correct practice reality." If the Four Noble Truths of suffering, accumulation, cessation, and path are explained as attained ultimate meaning, etc., the four truths of suffering, etc., are established through realizing and attaining principles, therefore called attained ultimate meaning. "Because the treatises themselves explain" refers to Yogācāra fascicle 64 and Xianzang fascicle 6, which in explaining the four levels of conventional truth, state that the Four Truths belong to the third conventional. Vijñāpti-mātra fascicle 9, in explaining the four levels of ultimate truth, states that the Four Truths belong to the second ultimate truth. These treatises all have authentic passages, therefore it says "because the treatises themselves explain."

"From Yogācāra fascicle 4 to belongs to the fourth ultimate truth": "Truth establishment, etc." means that bodhisattvas generally have four types of establishment: dharma, truth, principle, and vehicle. Now clarifying the second truth, therefore it says "truth establishment." The remaining dharma, principle, and vehicle are as extensively explained in the treatises.

Xianzang fascicle 8 also has this passage. "Or establishing one truth" refers to the meaning of non-falsity. Having only one truth with no second, it is called one truth. Master Jing said: Without questioning ultimate and conventional, they equally have the meanings of non-falsity, reality, and non-inversion, therefore collectively called one truth. Master Yu said: Truth means reality. Whether suffering, accumulation, cessation, or path, all are the examined reality meaning of cause and effect, therefore collectively establishing one truth. This explanation is difficult to understand. If explaining it as one truth based on the examined reality meaning of cause and effect, how can this passage say "belongs to the fourth ultimate truth"? The fourth ultimate truth is not the gate of cause and effect. What is now called "one truth" is namely the one truth explained in the Śrīmālā Sūtra. That sūtra says: "False dharmas are neither truth nor permanent nor refuge. Therefore the three of suffering, accumulation, and path are not ultimate meaning truth. What is not false is truth, is permanent, is refuge. Therefore cessation truth is ultimate meaning." Now being the same as that, it says "non-false truth belongs to the fourth ultimate truth."

"From 'or establishing two truths' to 'belongs to the two truths'": Saying "establishing two truths, etc." means that although the real meaning is the same, conventional truth is reality within the conventional, ultimate meaning truth is reality within the ultimate meaning. Therefore two truths are established. "Benevolent King Prajñā, etc." is text added by the chapter master, not Yogācāra text. "Following names in sequence, belonging to the two truths" means worldly truth belongs to conventional truth inclusion, ultimate meaning truth belongs to ultimate meaning truth inclusion.

"From 'or establishing three truths' to 'belongs to the latter two'": "First characteristic truth, etc." - characteristic means essence.

Namely the essential characteristics of all dharmas that are designated are called characteristic truth. The teaching dharmas that designate are called verbal truth. Therefore Xianzang calls it "designating truth." The functions of all dharmas are called functional truth. Like the eye seeing form and the ear hearing sound. These functions are called functional truth. The former characteristic and verbal truths each have functions. Characteristic serves as what is designated, verbal serves as what designates. These two are essence. Separating them makes two. The third functional truth is the function of dharma. Combining them, dharma is one, therefore it says "because there are differences in the separation and combination of essence and function."

"From 'or establishing four truths' to 'because causes and effects differ'": The causes of saṃsāra's fruits are called suffering and accumulation. The causes of nirvāṇa's fruits are called cessation and path. The meaning of these Four Truths is as previously quoted from Nirvāṇa fascicle 13, saying "as previously explained." The contaminated refers to saṃsāra. The pure refers to nirvāṇa. Each of these has causes and effects, therefore it says "each has different causes and effects." Question: Why are they named suffering, accumulation, cessation, path with fruit first then cause? If cause first then fruit, wouldn't it be explained as accumulation, suffering, path, cessation? Explanation: Nirvāṇa Sūtra fascicle 13 says: "All Buddha bhagavats explain them in sequence. Through this cause and condition, countless beings attain crossing over saṃsāra." Explanation: There are three sequences: first is the sequence of arising, like the nine successive concentrations; second is the sequence of explanation, like the four right efforts; third is the sequence of seeing, like explaining the Four Truths. If following the sequence of cause and effect, it would be first accumulation then suffering, first path then cessation. Now following the sequence of seeing, therefore first suffering then accumulation, first cessation then path. The reason for this is rejecting the fruit to sever the cause, aspiring to the fruit to cultivate the cause. Therefore like first knowing the illness, then knowing the illness's cause, then seeking the illness's cure, then seeking good medicine. When all Buddha bhagavats make this sequence and explain the Four Truths, countless beings attain crossing over saṃ-

sāra. Also regarding explaining this sequence, various explanations are not the same. Extensively as in Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā fascicle 78 and Master Zongfa's chapter in Satyasiddhi Treatise.

"From 'or establishing five truths' to 'the last one is suchness'": "First cause truth, etc." - regarding these five truths, there are two explanations. Accumulation and path are called cause truth; suffering and cessation are called effect truth. Wisdom and corresponding mental factors are called knowing truth - namely the wisdom of the Four Truths, etc. Conditioned and unconditioned object realms are called known truth - namely the objects of the Four Truths, etc. "Capable possessor, etc." - cause is called capable possessor, effect is called possessed. Knowing truth is called mind - though king and mental factors differ, mind is primary. Object truth is called object because it knows object realms. Regarding the mutual inclusion of the four levels, the meaning can be understood. The fifth ultimate meaning has two gates: if regarding the established gate, it belongs to the fourth conventional truth and third ultimate truth; if the non-established gate, it belongs to the fourth ultimate truth. "Or the first four types, etc." is the second explanation. The two truths of accumulation and suffering are called cause-effect truth; the two truths of path and cessation are called wisdom-object truth. The fifth ultimate truth refers to the above four natures, therefore fascicle 64 says: "Non-established refers to the suchness real nature of all dharmas." Between these two explanations, the first is broad and the latter narrow, therefore there are differences.

"From 'or establishing six truths' to 'belongs to the second ultimate truth'": Among the six truths, the first two explain true and false phenomena. Also good dharmas are called truth; unwholesome dharmas etc. are called false truth. "Ultimate meaning and conventional are two different categories, etc." - truth refers to ultimate meaning, false truth refers to conventional. Xianzang says: "First true truth, second false truth. Suffering and accumulation are called contaminated, cessation and path are called pure. Each of these has

Regarding the text "The second clarifies characteristics... also called sudden (satsui)." This clarifies the sudden arising of eye-consciousness and the simultaneously arising mental consciousness. First a general heading is established, then textual evidence is cited. This is the general heading. However, in the Compilation, attached to this section, the general essence is discussed.

If it is the intrinsic essence, it takes the one consciousness-aggregate, mental base, seven minds, and eight consciousnesses as its essence. If it is the corresponding essence, it takes the four aggregates, mental base, seven minds, eight consciousnesses, dharma-base, partial dharma-realm, and fifty-one mental factors as its essence.

Question: Is the sixth mental consciousness that arises together with the sudden arising of the five consciousnesses necessarily sudden?
Answer: Master Hong says it is indefinite. When hearing sounds while in meditation, that is purely wholesome in nature and therefore not sudden.
I think this is incorrect. Mental consciousness arising together with the sudden arising of the five consciousnesses is necessarily sudden. The treatise speaks about the majority of cases - the first three are neutral, but when in meditative states, they also extend to wholesome and others. Therefore sudden arising is also permitted to extend to wholesome nature.

Question: When hearing sounds in meditation, how many minds arise?
Answer: Only the first two minds. The reason for this is that there must be expectation before emergence. Expectation is precisely seeking, which is sudden. This can be understood as explained in the fifth volume of the Yogācāra Commentary.

Regarding the text "Therefore in the Yogācāra treatise... because it is included in seeking, etc." This cites textual evidence below as the first proof. In explaining this text, the Gashō has two explanations. The first explanation discusses only the sudden arising of independently arising mental consciousness. The second explanation does not distinguish between independent and simultaneous, but generally says "this explains the sudden mind of mental consciousness, etc." The details follow their explanations.

According to the Compilation, there are two explanations in the West, all explaining this treatise text in terms of independent mental consciousness. One cannot cite this to prove the sudden arising of co-object mental consciousness. This is crude. Now I rescue this by saying: "Mental consciousness naturally flowing... called sudden-falling mind" proves the sudden mind of simultaneous mental

consciousness. From "only objectifying the past" onward proves the seeking and other minds of mental consciousness following the five consciousnesses. Now examining the chapter master's citations before and after, this principle must be so. Without investigating the deep meaning, how can one rashly criticize? Details are reconciled below.

Regarding the text "Also in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra... because it suddenly falls into objects." This is the second proof. From "Therefore mental consciousness arising with eye-consciousness" onward is the chapter master's explanation. Although the five consciousnesses of eye, etc. are non-discriminating, they arise depending on discriminating mental consciousness. Taking the sixth consciousness as the discriminating root, they are then able to function. Therefore it says "one discriminating mental consciousness turns simultaneously." Therefore the mental consciousness arising with eye-consciousness is called sudden mind, etc. - this is the conclusion. Generally speaking of sudden arising, there are three types: sudden arising of the five consciousnesses, sudden arising of mental consciousness arising simultaneously, and sudden arising of independent mental consciousness. Now the first two are mentioned to show the characteristics of mind.

Regarding the text "This already initially objectifies... defiled-pure mind arises." "Confirming and understanding objects" refers to the time of determining mind, turning together with conviction, definitively confirming and understanding previously sought objects, hence "confirming and understanding objects." "Grasping characteristics of correct causes, etc." - the Yogācārabhūmi third volume says: "The causal characteristics of wrong, right, and contradictory actions are distinguished by intention. Wrong, right, and other actions are bodily and verbal karma. The causes of these actions are wholesome and unwholesome objects. By understanding these object-characteristics, intention creates various karma and gives rise to wholesome, unwholesome and other events." Therefore it says "grasping characteristics of correct causes, etc." "Dwelling in hatred toward enemies, etc." means: regarding objects of hatred, giving rise to anger and other defilements; regarding lovable objects, giving rise to attachment and other defilements. Or conversely, giving rise to non-hatred and other pure states; regarding what should be hated or loved, being able to forbear and abandon, therefore giving rise to equanimity in between and dwelling in impartial mind.

Regarding the text "Through this defiled-pure... equal consciousness is also the same." Through taking this defiled-pure mental consciousness as precedent, eye and other consciousnesses are drawn to be either defiled or pure, flowing equally to the previous, which constitutes uniform-flow mind. This has three categories: uniform flow of the five consciousnesses, uniform flow of co-object mental consciousness, and uniform flow of independently arising mental consciousness. Although the text has no separate explanation, reasoning necessarily requires this to be so. The middle three minds are mostly only mental consciousness. Their categories are two: mental consciousness following the five consciousnesses, and independently arising mental consciousness. Preparing by principle, the two minds of seeking and determining also have the five consciousnesses.

Regarding the text "Third, the eight consciousnesses... are not continuously flowing consciousnesses." This is the third section, broadly divided into two. First, following gross characteristics and explaining in accordance with the text. Second, from "However, the seventh consciousness" onward, following subtle characteristics and explaining exhaustively according to principle. This first follows gross characteristics and explains in accordance with the text. The reason why the six consciousnesses have these five minds but the seventh and eighth do not is that regarding consciousnesses that transform among the three natures and interrupted minds, the five minds are explained based on preceding and following dharmas. If the eighth consciousness continuously flows at all times, being uniformly neutral with no meaning of transformation, these five are not established. The seventh manas, although having the meaning of pure-defiled transformation, continuously flows with before and after being similar, so the five minds are not explained. Therefore in the Yogācāra, only the six consciousnesses are mentioned, not the seventh and eighth.

Regarding the text "However, the seventh consciousness... because it is not associated with desire." From here onward, following subtle characteristics and explaining exhaustively according to principle. In the seventh consciousness, in the causal stage there are only the latter three. Because objectifying is constantly fixed, there is no sudden arising. Because desire and others do not correspond, there is no seeking. However, the latter three minds can be said to be complete in meaning within one instant.

Not in sequence. The eighth is not like this - in the eighth consciousness, in the causal stage there are four, only excluding seeking. In the three realms, at the initial position of receiving birth, there is transformation of realm and ground. Because the objects of form and formless realms differ in breadth and narrowness, there is sudden mind. The fruition stage is also the same. The three objects of narrow, vast, and immeasurable are as explained in Yogācārabhūmi volume fifty-one.

Regarding the text "Through the seventh consciousness... there is sudden arising." "Although the seventh consciousness has initial birth in realm and ground, etc." - the seventh follows the eighth, and although at the initial birth stage there is transformation of realm and ground, because the objectified consciousness has similar characteristics, there is no sudden falling. If at the initial moment of first transformation there are three, excluding seeking and uniform flow. From the second moment onward, it immediately has the four minds. This is because even the first moment has uniform flow in terms of category. The second moment's meaning combined explains having four minds. Or "at the second time again giving rise to pure consciousness, etc." - if after ceasing in between, at the initial moment of arising again, it immediately has four. This is because it is the previous uniform flow. This also in one moment immediately has four minds.

Regarding the text "Here, first depending... again, what mind is this?" "Depending on the treatise's explanation of the six consciousnesses" - this is the heading that should be explained next. "The various minds that the seventh and eighth reasonably possess" refers to what was previously explained. That is, in the previous explanation following subtle characteristics and exhausting principle, first explaining the differences in various minds possessed by the seventh and eighth was completed. Below this clarifies how many minds the six consciousnesses possess. There are three masters' explanations. This is precisely the first master's explanation. This master's intention is: if following gross characteristics, explaining as the text states, then the first five consciousnesses have the initial and final two, and the sixth mental consciousness has all five minds. If following subtle characteristics and explaining exhaustively according to principle, the five consciousnesses also have the two minds of seeking and determining.

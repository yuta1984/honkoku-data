These are called the ten scatterings. For extensive explanation of names and meanings, [see] as explained in *Abhidharmasamuccaya* volume fourteen. Also, *Madhyāntavibhāga* in the chapter on distinguishing obstacles explains eight categories of obstacles: First, complete division, etc. five; second, love, etc. nine; third, non-application, etc. forty types of obstacles; fourth, arising, etc. ten types of obstacles; fifth, seven obstacles arising regarding the four foundations of mindfulness, etc. seven dharmas; sixth, ten obstacles arising regarding the ten perfections; seventh, ten obstacles arising within the ten dharma-realms; eighth, eleven types of obstacles that are the general meaning of the aforementioned various obstacles. These various obstacles are called "various obstacles" because their troublesome nature is not uniform. Extensively as explained there.

"Ninth, dependence... non-bodhisattvas later pervade the three realms and eight grounds, etc.": Later [it] pervades the three realms and eight-ground bodies. Speaking of "eight grounds" means the eight lower grounds excluding the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Above the summit of existence, there are no more ground-places. Due to this, there is no rejoicing in the upper and being weary of the lower, hence those dependent bodies have no meaning of subduing delusions. Question: Why does elimination pervade nine grounds while subduing [is limited to] only eight grounds? Explanation: Although there are wholesome paths in the summit-of-existence ground, because the power of weariness is inferior, [one] cannot achieve subduing, but only by arising lower contaminant-free [wisdom] can [one] eliminate the delusions of that ground. *Vijñāptimātratā Chapter* says: "Eliminating delusions [involves] nine, wandering observation [involves] ten." Based on this principle, the elimination path [involves] nine grounds, subduing only eight grounds.

"Bodhisattvas eliminating delusions... ordinary [beings] are not so": Bodhisattvas' subduing delusions pervades three-realm bodies. Pre-ground bodhisattvas are born in the formless realm, like Vipaśyanā Bodhisattva, etc. Elimination [applies] only to desire and form [realms]. Above ground [bodhisattvas] are not born in the formless realm. "Sage bodhisattvas" means ground-entering bodhisattvas. "Ordinary bodhisattvas" means pre-ground sudden-enlightenment bodhisattvas. In this present text, [it] only explains the meaning of elimination, not discussing the meaning of subduing. In principle,

[it] can also be explained. [It is] so because the text is abbreviated.

"Generally explained, separately... hence pervades that ground": Eliminating discriminative two obstacles, etc. - the word "obstacle" has general meaning but separate intent. Among the three vehicles, the two vehicles only eliminate afflictions and do not eliminate cognitive [obstacles]. Bodhisattvas completely eliminate both obstacles. Now [it] only speaks generally, hence says "two obstacles." Three continents means among the four continents, only excluding the northern continent. Because [beings there] have long lifespans, are entirely immersed in pleasure, and have the most inferior minds of weariness, [they] cannot eliminate delusions, hence that continent is excluded. "Extreme sorrow, not evil destinies," etc. is precisely text from *Abhidharmasamuccaya* volume sixteen. Evil destinies, though having superior weariness, lack superior dependence. Upper realms, though having superior dependence, lack strong weariness. Only the six heavens and three [human realms] of the desire realm, having both capacities, can enter direct realization. Speaking of "sorrow and joy" - *Yogācārabhūmi* sixty-nine says: "Consciousness corresponding to painful feelings is called sorrow; consciousness corresponding to pleasant feelings is called joy." For extensive explanation of distinctions, [see] as explained in that volume. The remaining text can be understood.

"If eliminating innate... because of arising in wisdom-places": If two-vehicle sages eliminate innate delusions, [this] pervades three-realm nine-ground bodies. Speaking of "nine grounds" means one ground of the desire realm and four each in the upper two [realms], taking these as nine. [This] does not mean combining the six of form and three of formless realm to make nine grounds. Bodhisattvas have two meanings, etc. - the two meanings are gradual and sudden meanings. [These are] not different explanations. The reason this is so is that there are two [types of] bodhisattvas: circuitous gradual enlightenment pervades desire and form realms. Turned-mind two-vehicle [practitioners], [having] life-bodies retained by transformational birth-death, pervade both realms. This corresponds to the second master's doctrine in *Vijñāptimātratā*. This is precisely the correct doctrine.

Question: If the retained bodies of indefinite persons pervade both realms, why does *Yogācārabhūmi* volume eighty

say "life-bodies retained by transformational birth-death are precisely in this continent"? Explanation: Although *Yogācārabhūmi* says retaining bodies in this continent, [it] does not say "only in the desire realm" to exclude [the possibility of] other realms being without [them], hence [this is] not authentic proof. Also, [it] only says "this continent," not saying "other continents" - are other continents without [them]? Hence [this] does not contradict principle. True-going sudden enlightenment only depends on the fourth meditation of the form realm. *Daśabhūmika Sūtra* volume twelve says: "That reward-benefit arises in Maheśvara wisdom-places." Hence those various ordinary beings do not receive transformational birth-death with desire-realm bodies. [They] cannot die and then be reborn in the Great Self-Mastery Palace. Upon reaching the eighth ground, the body must be born in the fourth dhyāna, and having attained a superior body, then receives the especially superior transformational body. Hence formerly [it was] called "Maheśvara," now [it] should be called "Maheśvareśvara." This means "Great Self-Mastery." Namely, above the Pure Abodes there is a real pure land, which is precisely the enjoyment body. Initially arising realization there, this is the tenth-ground bodhisattva's palace. This is only other-enjoyment land. Tenth-ground bodhisattvas' reward bodies go there. However, because maturation [karma belongs to] the same ground, treatises explain [it] as birth. According to reality, receiving transformation is in the places of the lower three heavens. [One] has not yet been able to be born in the pure land. Going there now is called birth. As explained in *Vijñāptimātratā Commentary* volume seven.

Question: *Daśabhūmika* [says] present-reward benefit receives Buddha-position, hence future-reward benefit arises in Maheśvara wisdom-places, etc. What are the meanings of present-reward and future-reward? Explanation: Practice being completed in this life and immediately realizing Buddha-fruit is called present-reward. Taking previous various practices only as remote causes, therefore Buddha-position is not called future-reward. Bodhisattvas' later bodies, being karmic results from pre-ground [practice], are called future-reward. Sages do not create karma that attracts the future.

Hence later-body bodhisattvas are called "wisdom." Because wisdom is most superior, [they] use wisdom to mark the name. This bodhisattva dwelling in that heaven is called "arising in wisdom-places." "Place" means dwelling-place. As explained in *Yanmi* volume six.

"Indefinite goers... because [there is] no formless realm": Regarding indefinite-nature turned-practice retained bodies, *Vijñāptimātratā* volume seven has two masters' explanations. One says: "All two-vehicle [practitioners] turning toward bodhisattvahood, after the desire realm generate contaminant-free [wisdom], [have] vow-power retained bodies only in the desire realm. Because upper realms lack such turned-mind sages, only the desire realm has initial arousal-of-mind conditions. Within upper realms [there are] no initial arousal-of-mind conditions. However, when accomplishing Buddhahood, riding on spiritual powers, going to the Self-Mastery Palace, then achieving Buddhahood - not further receiving birth." One says: "Form realms also have turned-practice śrāvakas, only excluding those of the first two fruits and pratyekabuddhas. Because their arousal of mind is absent in upper realms." Commentary seven says: "Among these two explanations, though lacking evaluating authorities, adoption or rejection [is left] to intention." This present text saying "pervading both realms" takes this explanation as correct. How do [they] contradict? Explanation: Because treatises lack judgment, [it is] left to intention. However, examining doctrinal principles, the second master is superior, hence now [taken as] correct. Within eliminating cognitive [obstacles], saying "two realms, five grounds" means combining desire realm one ground and form realm four grounds to make five grounds. These five-ground bodies eliminate cognitive [obstacles].

"Second, dependent grounds... because [they] do not arise": Within the text there are two [parts]. First clarifying subduing distinctions, later "if truly eliminating" below clarifying elimination distinctions. This is precisely the first. Form realm six grounds, etc. - within affliction-obstacles, subduing pervades ten grounds, namely form realm six grounds and formless four grounds. Form realm six grounds [are]:

factors are only conventional. "The five minds in concentration are all only direct perception" means that because they are free from scattered discrimination and operate through realization-practice, they are only direct perception. Question: Regarding defiled-pure mind, the treatises explain discrimination. Why do they all say it is non-discriminative? Answer: The treatises speak about scattered mind according to a particular meaning. If following the general meaning, what prevents there also being cases encompassed by direct perception?

Regarding the text "If in scattered state... understanding non-worldly objects." "Penetrating inference and non-valid cognition" etc. - this text is general. If speaking separately, among the five, the first three - if matured mind and the three neutrals serve as the three minds, they are all inference because there is no inverted grasping. If consciousness accompanying matured dharma-grasping serves as the three minds, this is encompassed by non-valid cognition because there is inversion. The two kinds of two minds all condition the three times, arising through discrimination, so they are not called direct perception. Within defiled-pure mind, the defiled side is only non-valid, the pure side is only inference. If neutral, they penetrate inference and non-valid cognition. Master Hong says that the first three minds of independent scattered consciousness, whatever neutral they follow, all condition the past. Now this is not the case. The textual meaning of "conditioning worldly and non-worldly" is rather hidden. Students should reflect.

Regarding the text "Yogācāra explains... because mostly conditioning." This reconciles contradictions. Question: If the five minds of independent arising penetrate and condition objects of three times and non-worldly realms, why does Yogācāra volume three say "When mental consciousness naturally scatters and conditions unfamiliar objects, desire etc. do not arise. At that time mental consciousness is called sudden-arising, conditioning only past objects"? The explanation says: In interpreting this Yogācāra text, there are three Western interpretations. First: Independent sudden-arising, if in scattered state, conditions only the past, because the treatise explains "conditioning only past objects." Second:

【Lower Section】
Independent sudden-arising penetrates and conditions objects of three times and non-worldly realms. "Conditioning only the past" and below belongs to the following sentence. Third: Independent sudden-arising conditions only the past - the meaning is the same as the first master, but interpreting the treatise text differs slightly from the first. As detailed in Master Guo's Mahāyānasaṃgraha Commentary. The Compilation says: The chapter master's interpretation is also difficult to understand. Since it speaks about post-five consciousness, how can it be called sudden-arising? Also post-five consciousness is separately explained in the next text. If both texts speak about post-five consciousness, how can the former be called sudden-arising and the latter called seeking-determining? The former explains conditioning only past, the latter explains conditioning only present, etc. Now rescuing this, I say: The seeking minds etc. of post-five mental consciousness, regarding previously conditioned objects, although not arising sudden-arising, when new objects arrive, there may also be sudden-arising. This sudden-arising mind also conditions the past. Because post-five mental consciousness involves discrimination. It does not mean conditioning previous past objects and further arising sudden-arising. Therefore there is no contradiction. Question: If so, why does Yogācāra say "Mental consciousness arising immediately after five consciousnesses, either seeking or determining, conditions only present" etc.? Answer: Speaking in terms of moments, it actually conditions the past. Now speaking about present continuity, it explains conditioning present. Like calling one lifetime "present."

Regarding the text "Mental consciousness accompanying the five... because of clear apprehension." This represents the position that the three valid cognitions do not occur simultaneously. Contradictory functions regarding one object-situation cannot arise together, so they do not occur simultaneously. "Because it creates evidential understanding" - the Nyāyamukha says "In the mental ground there is also freedom from various discriminations, with only realization-practice operating." This clarifies that mental consciousness conditioning the same objects is also direct perception.

"The five accompanying condition the eighteen elements" etc. contradicts Vijñaptimātratā saying "The five sense organs are obtained through inference." Excluding Buddha, concentrated mind, and eighth consciousness objects, all the rest are obtained through inference. "Following the five present dusts" etc. refers to what the five consciousnesses condition - the five present dusts.

Regarding the text "According to one interpretation it is indefinite... and non-worldly objects." This is the second interpretation, the position that three valid cognitions occur simultaneously. "Natures are not the same" etc. means among the five minds, in sudden-arising stage there may be different natures, like hearing sounds in concentration, etc. Or there may be same nature, like other scattered sudden-arising etc. In the seeking etc. two stages, they have the same neutral nature. The fourth and fifth stages both penetrate the three natures. Now showing this generally, it says "natures are not even the same."

Question: If defiled-pure mind becomes good-evil through self-discrimination, seeking-determining are also discrimination - they should become good-evil. Answer: Though having discrimination, they are not yet decided regarding objects, so cannot perform beneficial-harmful actions. Therefore seeking mind is not called good-evil. It is not that upon initial determination one can immediately benefit-harm. Therefore determining mind is not called good-evil. After determination, through self-discrimination, one can create benefit-harm, then it is called defiled-pure.

"Firm grasping and inference" etc. refers to inference and non-valid cognition. Casually conditioning a jar is also non-valid cognition - not necessarily firm grasping. Now speaking about the majority, contrasting with inference meaning, it is merely called firm grasping.

Regarding the text "If conditioning one object... conditioning past objects." Saying "one-five" means among the five consciousnesses, appropriately taking one moment as a general name, hence "one-five." Like calling one person the "six-group monks" because they are the same type. "Not accompanying the five" etc. refers to post-five mental consciousness, conditioning momentary past, penetrating inference and

non-valid cognition. This means mental consciousness arising in seeking etc. stages.

Regarding the text "Yogācāra says... because that object arises." This reconciles contradictions. Question: If sudden post-five and seeking etc. mental consciousness condition the past, why does Yogācāra say "The seeking and determining of mental consciousness arising immediately after five consciousnesses should only be explained as conditioning present objects" etc.?

Therefore now reconciling: This calls it present regarding completed events. Also these two minds of seeking and determining arise conditioning those past objects of five consciousness moments. However, the Compilation questions this reconciliation saying: If so, the three minds' meaning encompasses two approaches. If speaking about moments, it is called conditioning past. If speaking about completed events, it is called conditioning present. Since the meaning is indefinite, how can it say "only"? Now rescuing this: When the treatise says "conditioning only present," "only" has three meanings. Now taking the selective-sustaining meaning to explain "only conditioning." What does this meaning mean? If speaking about moments, it is called "conditioning only past," thus distinguishing continuity-time. If speaking about completed events, it is called "conditioning only present," thus distinguishing other presents. Since there is distinction according to circumstances, there is no obstruction.

Regarding the text "Defiled-pure are also thus... therefore the treatise speaks partially." "Defiled-pure are also thus" means like those post-five seeking-determining, post-five mental consciousness defiled-pure are also thus. If speaking about moments, it is called conditioning past. If speaking about completed events, it is called conditioning present. Therefore it says "defiled-pure are also thus." If so, why does the treatise explain three minds without explaining defiled-pure? The first three have the same nature, so the treatise speaks partially.

Regarding the text "Twelfth question... because not perfect." Showing the answer's meaning - the stages where mind arises are extremely

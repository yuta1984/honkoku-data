The sutra says "because it is non-established, it is therefore unconditioned." Now discussing the latter meaning, there is no problem.

"From 'or explaining nine truths' to 'second ultimate truth'": Impermanence truth is called "expedient truth" in the *Prakaraṇāryavāca-śāstra*. The initial impermanence practice can serve as expedient for suffering, emptiness, etc., therefore also called expedient truth. Among these nine truths, impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and no-self are namely suffering truth. This divides into four based on the four objects of suffering. Existence-craving and non-existence-craving are namely accumulation truth. This divides into two based on the two types of craving for future existence: eternalist and nihilist views. Namely, arising eternalist view regarding future existence is called existence-craving; arising nihilist view is called non-existence-craving. The expedient for severing them is namely path truth. Severing the former two cravings and views is uncontaminated preliminary practice, therefore called "expedient truth for severing them." With-remainder and without-remainder are namely cessation truth. These latter three types, based on one path and one cessation, are divided into three. The fourfold mutual inclusion can be understood as written.

"From 'or explaining ten truths' to 'one is unconditioned cessation'": Among these ten truths, the first five are suffering truth, namely contaminated fruits. The sixth karma truth and seventh affliction are accumulation truth, namely retribution causes. The eighth and ninth are path truth, namely supramundane path. The tenth is cessation truth, namely unconditioned cessation.

Among these ten truths, the first five are suffering truth, namely unconditioned cessation.

"From 'among the five suffering truths' to 'second ultimate inclusion'": "The first one includes four sufferings, etc." means within the first pressing suffering truth, it includes four sufferings: birth suffering, aging suffering, death suffering, and meeting with the hateful suffering. The four sufferings of birth, etc. all arise from oppression and generate suffering, therefore called pressing suffering truth. The second truth of lacking wealth and position is called "truth of insufficient enjoyment" in the *Prakaraṇāryavāca-śāstra*, namely the suffering of not obtaining what one seeks. The third

truth of unequal elements is called "truth of conflicting loving nature" in the *Prakaraṇāryavāca-śāstra*. This is namely illness suffering, arising from the conflict of the four elements. "Unequal" means conflicting. Master Xing said: The first pressing suffering only includes three sufferings: birth, aging, and death. The third unequal elements suffering is meeting with the hateful suffering. Due to meeting with the hateful, the body becomes uneasy, therefore called unequal elements suffering. The fourth beloved transformation and destruction suffering is called merely "craving-hatred suffering truth" in the *Prakaraṇāryavāca-śāstra*, namely separation from the beloved suffering. The fifth gross suffering briefly includes all five grasping aggregate sufferings. Among the five suffering truths, all eight sufferings are included. Saying "briefly including all five grasping aggregate sufferings" is also called "brief explanation of all five grasping aggregate sufferings." All sufferings are included in contaminated grasping aggregates, therefore called "brief explanation of all five grasping aggregate sufferings." *Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā* fascicle 78 says: Question: The five grasping aggregate sufferings are vast in measure. Why are they called brief? Answer: Although sufferings are vast, because they are briefly explained, they are called brief. The five grasping aggregates have extremely many afflictions and cannot be extensively explained. Wanting to make disciples generally generate aversion and departure, they are briefly explained. Like a person having many faults that cannot be extensively explained - when someone asks about those faults, one can only generally answer "this is an extremely evil person." Though the words are brief, the faults are very extensive. This is also thus, therefore called "brief explanation of all five grasping aggregate sufferings."

"From 'herein briefly' to 'each first of the ten truths'": The verse saying "non-false, world, characteristics, suffering, etc." - this verse only versifies the Yogācāra ten truths, not versifying the other intermediate texts. "Non-false" refers to the non-false truth in the increasing-by-one section. "World" refers to the first conventional truth in the increasing-by-two section. The next

"characteristics" refers to the first characteristic truth in the increasing-by-three section. The next "suffering" refers to the first suffering truth in the increasing-by-four section. The next "cause" refers to the first cause truth in the increasing-by-five section. The next "truth" refers to the first truth-truth in the increasing-by-six section. The next "craving" refers to the first attachment truth in the increasing-by-seven section. The next "conditioning" refers to the first conditioning-suffering nature truth in the increasing-by-eight section. The next "impermanence" refers to the first impermanence truth in the increasing-by-nine section. The last "pressing" refers to the first pressing suffering truth in the increasing-by-ten section. "Each first of the increasing ten truths" means beginning from increasing-by-one and ending with increasing-by-ten, collectively taking the first names. The rest are all briefly included. This explains the meaning of the above three phrases. According to tradition, Question: Why is the name of the tenth recurrence truth not mentioned? Answer: If separately explained, it would be the former four truths, so not separately mentioned. This explanation is difficult to understand. "Pressing" refers to the first pressing suffering truth in the increasing-by-ten section. The text already presents the verse - how could there be further doubt? The detailed explanations of these ten truths are as explained in the Yogācāra, *Prakaraṇāryavāca-śāstra*, commentaries and sub-commentaries, etc.

"From 'question-answer distinctions' to 'because of the latter three truths'": Below there are altogether six question-answers. The first one and latter two are the chapter master's question-answers. The middle question-answers are namely from Yogācāra treatise fascicle 64. This is the first question-answer: Among the four levels, which are established and which are non-established? In the answer, *Prakaraṇāryavāca-śāstra* fascicle 6 says the four types of conventional truths are all established. Yogācāra fascicle 64 says the fourth ultimate is non-established. From these two texts, it reveals that the former three ultimates are also of established nature because they are conventional, being the latter three truths.

"From 'question-answer: if established' to 'also attain liberation'": The following three question-answers are all from Yogācāra treatise fascicle 64. Regarding "characteristic bondage, gross bondage, etc.": The great Tang Tripiṭaka said there are two Western explanations. First: All contaminated aspects are the essence of characteristic bondage. Due to the power of contaminated aspects, discriminating consciousness, etc. cannot understand that all contaminated dharmas are like illusions - non-existent yet appearing existent. Due to ignorance, one grasps that form, mind and other dharmas truly exist. According to this explanation, characteristics are bondage, therefore called characteristic bondage - a determinative compound. Second: Manas consciousness is the essence of characteristic bondage. Due to the power of the four afflictions corresponding to manas consciousness, among the afflictions of the six consciousnesses, regarding various aspects, one cannot understand them as like illusory phenomena, etc. Therefore manas is called characteristic bondage. According to this explanation, "characteristics" means aspects, "bondage" means manas. Because it is bondage of characteristics, it is a possessive compound. Regarding "gross bondage," there are also two types. First: the non-capability nature in contaminated dharmas is called gross bondage. With contaminated dharmas, neither one nor different. Second: the seeds of the two obstructions are generally called gross. Through this power, all contaminated five aggregates and other dharmas have nothing to be capable of. This is called gross bondage.

"From 'question: if non-established' to 'therefore establish the established'": This is also treatise text. "Having something to reject, etc." below is the chapter master's text. "Having something to reject, etc." means generally discussing cultivation, there are briefly four types: first, severing obstructions; second, cultivation; third, seeking results; fourth, knowing objects. These four types all extend through the five stages. "Severing obstructions" means like suppressing and severing the two obstructions in the five stages. Accumulation of provisions and preparation only suppress, not sever. In the latter three stages, they extend to both suppression and severance. The next "cultivation": within the five stages of accumulation of provisions, etc., all complete the two practices of self-benefit and benefiting others, and the twenty perfections of merit and wisdom.

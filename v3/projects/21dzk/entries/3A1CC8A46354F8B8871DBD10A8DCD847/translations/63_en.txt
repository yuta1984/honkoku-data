When [wisdom] has already arisen, [one] has not yet attained Buddha-fruit. According to the latter master, at the uninterrupted path stage, maturation consciousness still exists and mirror-wisdom has not yet arisen. Only at the liberation path does mirror-wisdom first arise. Dharmapāla's correct teaching considers following the latter master as superior.

"The tenth question and answer... what is explained is not the same": Within this section there are eight sets of questions and answers. Among these, the second question comes from the *Vibhāṣā*. The fourth question is the intention of the chapter master. The fifth question comes from the *Abhidharma*, etc. The remaining six questions and answers all come from the *Yogācārabhūmi*. Among the answers to the six questions and answers, the first and third come from *Yogācārabhūmi* volume fifty-eight. The remaining four questions and answers come from volume fifty-nine, hence that text says: "Furthermore, how can [one] eliminate afflictions? To what extent should [one] say afflictions have been eliminated? From which afflictions can [one] explain eliminating all afflictions? Sudden or gradual? How does [one] eliminate various afflictions in sequence? How many types are there of eliminating various afflictions? After eliminating afflictions, what characteristics are there? What benefits are there in eliminating various afflictions?" Together there are eight questions. Now within this text, [it] briefly raises four questions. [We] should make correspondences when reaching the text. Now saying "in the three times, regarding what is elimination explained" is precisely the *Yogācārabhūmi* fifty-eight question. Because within fifty-nine, this text is completely absent. Fifty-eight says: "Question: Does [one] eliminate the past? Does [one] eliminate the future? Does [one] eliminate the present?" Extensively as explained there. "What the Sarvāstivādins and others explain is not the same" - according to the Sarvāstivādins, at the time of the uninterrupted path, the possession of afflictions still exists. If there were no present possession, there would be nothing to eliminate. By this, [they] eliminate present possession during the uninterrupted [path]. According to the Sautrāntika school, at the time of the uninterrupted path, affliction-seeds that should be eliminated should arise but do not arise - this is called elimination.

[This is] greatly similar to Mahāyāna. Now the intention of this question is: within Mahāyāna doctrine, the two times [past and future] are without substance, and the present is not together with the path - how can [this] be called elimination? Hence [it] says "in the three times, regarding what is elimination explained."

"Now depending on Mahāyāna... what more is there to eliminate": Within fifty-nine, this text is completely absent. Only fifty-eight has this text. Hence that text says: "Question: Does [one] eliminate the past? Does [one] eliminate the future? Does [one] eliminate the present? Answer: [One] does not eliminate past, future, and present. However, [one] eliminates the three times" up to the extensive explanation - all the same as what is quoted here. Now in this text, "not eliminating past, future, present... therefore the three times can all be called eliminated" - all is treatise text. "Not eliminating past, future, present" etc. means: the past has already perished, the future has not yet arisen, the present does not abide. All are not eliminable. Hence [it] says "not eliminating past, future, present." This concerns dharmas of dependent arising from causes and conditions, like magical transformations that quickly arise and perish, hence cannot be eliminated. [One] should also explain that within ultimate truth, all dharmas are suchness, hence there is nothing to eliminate. However, concerning the continuous succession of one body before and after, only through the power of the noble path, causing that basic consciousness of the three times to attain separation from latent defilements, hence [it] also explains eliminating the three times. The *Ten Grounds* says: "Neither initial, nor middle-later, because [it] grasps before-middle-after." "The past does not have latent defilements because mind naturally perishes" etc. means: the past has already perished and does not await causes and conditions, naturally perishing. The future because generative conditions are not yet complete. Present dharmas do not abide for even one moment. Thus ultimately all are not eliminable, hence [it] says "what more is there to eliminate."

"Also there are latent defilements... also not [objects] to be eliminated": This clarifies that defiled and pure minds cannot unite, and also are not [objects] to be eliminated. Generally, union has two [types]. First is spatial union, like an axe chopping wood. Second is substantial union. Various dharmas are like causes, like understanding-delusion two minds. First is not spatial. Second is produced by causes and conditions. Like illusions, like transformations, hence there is no substantial union. Through such principles, [one] cannot speak of elimination. Hence [it] says "the present also is not [an object] to be eliminated."

"However, from others' words... principles should be known": Above, concerning the blocking approach, [it] did not eliminate the three times. Below, concerning the revealing approach, [it] allows eliminating the three times. "Others' words and sounds" means teachings of good friends. Right mental application means mental application in accordance with principle. Right view means non-discriminating contaminant-free wisdom. That is, within the continuous path, when antidotal paths arise, minds to be treated perish. Presently without latent defilements, regarding past and future, [it] explains eliminating the three times. When this antidotal mind is just arising, when that mind to be treated is just perishing, equally and equally, like when both ends of a scale are low and high equally. Arising being the same as the time of perishing is one equality. Perishing being the same as the time of arising is again one equality. Therefore [it] repeatedly says "equally and equally." Like worldly light arising and darkness perishing, understanding arising and delusion perishing - the principle is also thus. Hence [it] says "principles of antidotal arising and perishing should be known."

"Corresponding to right view... all can be called elimination": This meaning explains: concerning the continuous succession of one body before and after, through the power of cultivating the noble path, causing basic consciousness etc., the three times all attain separation from latent defilements, hence [this is] called eliminating the three times. However, depending on this text, there are two explanations in the west. First,

Nanda, Śūramgama and other treatise masters say: within one instant, [they] permit having two times, namely arising and abiding. If depending on their explanation, seeds to be treated are at the time of arising characteristics, later uninterrupted paths are still in the future. Seeds of obstacles to be treated have already reached abiding characteristics, their uninterrupted paths are just at arising characteristics. Through this, antidotal paths are just in the present and can eliminate affliction-seeds possessed in the present. When those uninterrupted paths are at abiding characteristics, affliction-seeds have already perished and are at the position of perishing characteristics. This is precisely the past. Second, Dharmapāla and others say: [they] do not permit one instant to allow having before and after. Through this, when paths are at arising characteristic positions, seeds of afflictions to be treated are already at perishing characteristics. Because arising and perishing are equal, [it] says "like scales being equally low and high." "Good and neutral minds included in the world" etc. Question: All wisdom etc. possessed by bodies that eliminate latent defilements are contaminant-free. How can [it] now speak of "neutral mind"? Explanation: Mind when entering contemplation is only contaminant-free. If after exiting contemplation, [there are] either good minds or neutral [minds]. Now because [this] concerns exiting contemplation, [there is] no contradiction.

"Question: afflictions to be eliminated... those who advance succeed, those who retreat": This arises as a question depending on afflictions. Hence that treatise's sixtieth [volume] says: "Using this path, if [one] eliminates desire realm bonds, if [one] retreats from this path, does [one] again obtain bondage by those bonds or not?" up to extensive explanation. The meaning of retreating and not retreating is like that extensive explanation. "Abiding in non-movement" etc., "non-retreating" etc. establishes six natures. [This is the] distinction between greater and lesser families. If depending on *Abhidharma*, [it] only establishes six types, namely "retreat-dharma" up to "non-movement." Speaking of "retreat-dharma" means among dull faculties, the extremely inferior ones - encountering conditions they immediately retreat, [this is] called retreat-dharma. That is, dull faculty nature - whether wandering scattered, whether thinking, or whether not thinking, all necessarily retreat and lose present dharma blissful abiding. This is precisely worldly meditative bliss, not retreating from noble dharmas. Those of "thought-dharma" fear necessarily retreating and losing present dharma blissful abiding, constantly

Explanation says: Now these Two Truths are explained according to meaning-gates, therefore commonly called truths. To distinguish true and conventional, therefore conventional truth cannot be called true. If discussing dharmas within the true reality gate, then both principle and phenomena are called true. Therefore in the Bodhisattva Stages, the two natures of phenomena and reality are equally called "true reality." Now according to meaning-gates, both are called truths. "Phenomena as real phenomena" etc. means among the four levels of ultimate, the first one is called phenomena. The dharmas of the three categories are substantial phenomena. The latter three are called principles - following the order of Four Noble Truths, two emptinesses, and one true principle. Although there is no doctrinal explanation, the two types can also be called Noble Truths. Nirvāṇa Chapter 13 says: "Good son, knowing the Noble Truths has two kinds of wisdom: one middle, one superior..." up to extensive explanation. Also in the Śrīmālā Sūtra, it explains "Immeasurable Noble Truths Chapter." The text is already clear. How can it now say "although there is no doctrinal explanation"? Explanation: In various sacred teachings, they generally speak of "Noble Truths" but do not explain "Two Noble Truths, etc." Since they say "two," it is not false.

Regarding the text "Next explaining separate names... called conventional": "All ordinary beings consider as existent" etc. means dharma-substances are not necessarily existent, but all worldly beings commonly speak of and grasp them as existent - namely real self-dharmas, jars, bowls, etc. Next, conventional principle etc. means principles explained by worldly sentient beings possessing investigation and analysis, where both substance and function exist - namely aggregates, sense-bases, realms, conditioned and unconditioned dharmas.

Regarding the text "Realization conventional... all intrinsic-activity explanations": Realization conventional etc. means worldly scholars practice provisionally, removing evil and working for good, realizing sacred fruits. For this purpose, they provisionally establish differentiations of defiled and pure causes and effects like suffering etc., causing them to enter. Therefore called "realization." This refers to Four Noble Truths principles etc. Next, ultimate

conventional etc. means after worldly scholars have practiced, they take this excellence as what is realized. What is realized surpasses multitudinous dharmas excellently, known by sages, called "ultimate." This refers to two-emptiness suchness.

Regarding the text "Worldly ultimate... called ultimate": First worldly ultimate etc. means various learning practitioners through worldly discourse consider this as existent - namely aggregates, sense-bases, realms, etc. These aggregates etc. have coarse and manifest phenomenal characteristics that can still be destroyed, called "worldly." This is also known by subsequent-attainment sacred wisdom, surpassing the first conventional, called "ultimate." Next, principle ultimate etc. means various scholars jointly establish principles. Four Noble Truths principles etc. mean knowing suffering, severing accumulation, realizing cessation, cultivating the path - the cause-effect differentiations of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are called "principles." Among these Four Truths, their nature and principle are realms of correct wisdom; their characteristics and phenomena are realms of subsequent wisdom. Now generally manifesting both, therefore saying undefiled wisdom realm surpasses the previous two conventionals.

Regarding the text "Realization ultimate... again called ultimate": First realization ultimate etc. means various learning practitioners through this skillful means can realize sacred fruits, therefore called "first realization ultimate." This refers to two-emptiness suchness. Next, ultimate ultimate means various learning practitioners, having practiced, take this profound excellence as what is realized. What is realized has subtle substance difficult to express, therefore called "ultimate." It is inner realization of sacred wisdom, surpassing the previous four conventionals, again obtaining the name "ultimate." This refers to abandoning explanation discussing essence, one true dharma realm, non-established suchness.

Regarding the text "Herein worldly... dependent-warrior without fault": "Or ultimate's truth dependent-warrior without fault" means if speaking completely, or worldly's ultimate up to ultimate's ultimate, saying dependent-warrior would be

without fault. Now according to this text, among the previous four conventionals, one could also say worldly's conventional up to ultimate's conventional - dependent-warrior would be without fault. The text is merely abbreviated. Now these Two Truths both encompass persons and dharmas. What middle wisdom knows is called "conventional truth"; what superior wisdom knows is called "ultimate truth." Also, inferior principles are called "conventional truth"; superior principles are called "ultimate truth." According to the shallow and deep of person-dharma principles, the coarse and subtle of wisdom realms, differentiations are distinguished. Therefore the Two Truths each have four levels. These Two Truths completely encompass all dharmas. Question: The Original Practice Jeweled Net Sūtra explains having three truths: first, existence truth; second, non-existence truth; third, ultimate meaning truth. If so, there should be twelve levels, as three each have four. Explanation: This has two meanings. First, there are various sentient beings who, hearing the Buddha explain "two," take meaning according to words, thinking there are Two Truths. Taking meaning according to words, there is nothing at all. To eliminate that illness, therefore additionally explaining first truth as third truth. Their conceptualized two are precisely imagined constructions, therefore included in conventional truth. Second, due to nature-characteristic meaning, the previously explained Two Truths, though meaning-gates differ, their essence is neither one nor different. Therefore explaining non-duality as ultimate meaning. Question: If Two Truths completely encompass dharmas, why does the Benevolent Kings Sūtra say "transcending conventional truth and ultimate meaning truth as the eleventh ground, calling omniscience awakening"? Also Original Practice says: "Does Buddha independently exist non-duality outside the Two Truths?" Explanation: Transcending outside the Two Truths known by tenth-ground bodhisattvas, independently existing non-duality is called the eleventh ground. However, according to Buddha's wisdom, it naturally distinguishes Two Truths, therefore there is no contradiction.

Regarding the text "Next presenting truth substance... wheels etc. have no substance": This presents the first worldly conventional substance.

"Manifestation Treatise explains" etc. refers to Manifestation volume six text. "Or without real substance" etc. below is the chapter master's explanatory text. Manifestation six says: "Worldly conventional means establishing fields, houses, jars, bowls, armies, forests, numbers, etc., and establishing self, sentient beings, etc." Explanation: Such dharmas are commonly accepted by the world, therefore called "worldly conventional." Jars, armies, forests, etc., though without real substance, have provisional function, therefore saying "or without real substance." Self, sentient beings, etc. not only lack function but also lack real substance, therefore saying "or substance is really non-existent." Only sentient beings, names, etc. - having names without reality is conventional, like jars, clothes, etc. Having names with reality is true, like form, scent, etc. Question: If armies, forests, etc. are also called conventional truth, why does Yogācāra fifty-two say "matters of food, vehicles, armies, forests, etc. have nothing at all, not included in conditioned, not included in unconditioned"? Explanation: Fifty-two saying "not included in conditioned or unconditioned" clarifies inclusion according to substance. Army, forest, etc. dharmas have no separate conditioned or unconditioned substance, therefore saying "nothing existing." The Two Truths gate explains according to meaning-gates, therefore included in conventional. Five kinds of worldly dharmas: first, name-world; second, sentence-world; third, binding-world; fourth, dharma-world; fifth, attachment-world, as extensively explained below. Sentient beings etc. having no function means not only lacking substance but also lacking provisional function. This concerns real self. If provisional self, then included in other-dependent, not lacking provisional function. Fire wheels etc. having no substance means having slight illuminating function but no real substance, therefore saying "no substance." Question: Manifestation six says: "Imagined constructions can perform five activities: first, can generate other-dependent nature; second, precisely within this, generate various discourses; third, can generate sentient being grasping; fourth, can generate dharma grasping; fifth, can absorb and receive habitual tendencies and coarse heaviness of both graspings."

[They are] gradually eliminated at [each] ground. Third is indefinite gradual or sudden, namely innate afflictions within the six consciousnesses. Now saying "their latent afflictions, etc., briefly have four types, etc." immediately reveals the meaning of the third indefinite gradual or sudden. This is the first type. Namely, those among the two vehicles who gradually depart and ordinary beings, etc., make elimination of eighty-one grades. However, identity-view and extreme views, etc., are each eliminated at the ninth [grade] of each ground; the rest are each eliminated in nine grades. [Treatise] ten immediately says: "One type of two vehicle [practitioners] gradually eliminate the three realms' nine grounds, each one by one, in nine separate grades" - this is it. Those identity-views, etc., are included only in the ninth grade, and only the two vehicles can eliminate them. Worldly ordinary beings' defiled wisdom, etc., cannot subdue them.

"Second, following their... then sequential elimination": This second type refers to afflictions of the lower eight grounds - following how much one subdued them in ordinary stages, afterward upon entering the seeing path, [they] are suddenly eliminated simultaneously with what is eliminated by seeing. What remains unsubdued is gradually eliminated within the cultivation path. Saying "not subdued, not eliminated" means what remains unsubdued does not get eliminated upon entering seeing, but only upon reaching the cultivation path is gradually eliminated. What is called "what remains unsubdued"? If discussing the extreme maximum, it is afflictions of the Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception ground. If discussing the extreme minimum type, it is indefinite - among the various grade afflictions up to the three emptiness [absorptions], one should distinguish accordingly. Dividing grade numbers, after entering seeing they are then sequentially eliminated - this is cultivation path elimination.

"Third, nine grounds... because of sudden transcendence": This third type means combining nine grounds into nine grades, eliminating separately according to grade. Like those who suddenly depart from the stream-enterer fruit, generally bundling the nine grounds into one [set of] nine grades, gradually eliminating and transcending to take the non-learner [stage]. [Treatise] ten immediately says: "One type of two vehicle [practitioners] combine the three realms' nine

grounds into one aggregate of nine grades and eliminate separately" - this is it. Also, the *Abhidharmasamuccaya* says: "Stream-enterers have two [types]: first gradual, second sudden. Those who suddenly depart means after entering truth direct realization, depending on stopping and not-yet-attained concentration, generating supramundane paths, suddenly eliminating all afflictions of the three realms. [Though called] separate grade elimination, [they] only establish two fruits: namely stream-enterer fruit and arhat fruit." Explaining: After attaining the first fruit, generally bundling the eighty-one grades of cultivation-eliminated afflictions of nine grounds, using nine uninterrupted paths and liberation paths, [they] can exhaust all outflows. Like breaking and cutting bamboo, the path that eliminates the superior grade of desire is precisely this path capable of eliminating the superior grade possessions of the Peak of Existence - a noble path. Even down to the lowest-lowest should be understood likewise. Having eliminated the six [grades] of desire, eliminating the six [grades] of the eight grounds of upper realms is not called "once-returner." Having eliminated the nine grades of desire and also exhausting the nine grades of the eight grounds of upper realms is not called "non-returner," because [one goes] suddenly from stream-enterer to arhat.

"Fourth, three realms... because of not eliminating afflictions": This fourth type refers to bodhisattvas who eliminate the eighty-one grades of innate afflictions of the three realms' nine grounds at the vajra-mind, keeping them without elimination during the ten grounds' causal [stage], because they do not obstruct the grounds. [They] only obstruct Buddha fruition, and later upon reaching the vajra [stage], suddenly eliminate [them] all at once. [Treatise] ten immediately says: "Bodhisattvas necessarily arise the vajra-like concentration and within one instant suddenly eliminate the three realms" - this is it. The *Compilation* says: Among these four types, the second type has meaning but no text; the remaining three types have both text and meaning complete. Now I say this is not so. *Disclosure of the Sacred Teaching* three says: "One-returner candidate means there is one who, using worldly paths, doubly departs from desire realm greed and already proceeds to enter correct nature determination."

By this [we] clearly know the second type also has authentic text. Question: Regarding six-consciousness innate [afflictions] that, following what was previously subdued, when entering the seeing path are eliminated simultaneously with what is eliminated by seeing - while previous subduing is reasonable, identity-view and extreme views, etc., were not previously subdued at earlier times. How could [one] eliminate them and transcend-realize non-returner? The *Compilation* says: This has five explanations. First says: The seeing path does not eliminate them. Even after transcending the fruit, [they] are also not immediately eliminated, [but] upon reaching vajra-mind are eliminated simultaneously with seventh [consciousness] grasping. Second says: After transcending and attaining the fruit, [one] separately arises paths to eliminate [them]. Since [they] already do not obstruct the fruit, how could [they] be called afflictions of that ground? Like seventh [consciousness] grasping - what contradiction would this have? Third says: When transcending and attaining the fruit, after resembling seeing path, without further emerging from contemplation, [one] separately arises victorious advancement preparatory paths, etc., eliminates what was not yet subdued, and attains the third fruit. That various places only speak of sixteen minds establishing fruits refers to explaining the first fruit, not transcendence. Fourth says: When transcending and attaining the fruit, from resembling seeing path [one] immediately enters cultivation path, through uninterrupted and liberation [paths] eliminates what was not yet subdued, and then attains that fruit, because there is no capacity to separately arise preparatory paths. Fifth says: When transcending and attaining the fruit, [these are] eliminated simultaneously with what is eliminated by seeing. Though previous conventional paths did not subdue self-grasping, because intention and joy are superior, when entering the seeing path, subdued and unsubdued are eliminated simultaneously all at once. Therefore [one] transcends and attains the third fruit. Though there are five explanations, the fifth is superior.

"However, within six consciousnesses... because types are the same": Above explained eliminating latent afflictions; below explains eliminating habitual tendencies. In eliminating afflictive habits during ten grounds cultivation path, there are two explanations. First says: Afflictive habitual

tendencies perfume cognitive [obstacles], so when eliminating cognitive [obstacles], they also follow and are eliminated, because [they] equally obstruct grounds. First says: It's not that afflictions necessarily perfume cognitive [obstacles], but the afflictive habits possessed by the ten grounds are extremely subtle, so [they are] equal with cognitive [obstacles] and equally obstruct dharma-emptiness, therefore the ten grounds eliminate them. Saying "because types are the same" means first-grade afflictive habitual tendencies and first-grade cognitive obstacles are the same grade, up to ninth-grade afflictive habitual tendencies and ninth-grade cognitive obstacles being the same grade. Their power is equal and they equally obstruct the ten grounds, hence called "same types."

"Within seventh consciousness... habitual tendencies likewise": Above explained six consciousness obstacles; below clarifies seventh [consciousness] obstacles. If [following] the master who explains nine grades, each of the nine grounds has nine grades - finely divided there are eighty-one grades. If [following] the master who explains one grade, the nine grounds are only the same as Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception ninth grade afflictions. These two masters both say regarding power and what [they] obstruct, all are the same as Peak of Existence lowest-lowest grade afflictions, therefore vajra-mind suddenly eliminates [them] all at once. Since obstacle essence is thus, and habitual tendencies are also thus, all are eliminated in one grade.

"Those cognitive obstacles... same as afflictions": Above explained eliminating afflictions; below explains eliminating cognitive [obstacles]. Within [this] there are two [parts]: first clarifying six consciousnesses, later from "that seventh consciousness" onward clarifying the seventh consciousness. Within the former there are two [parts]: first clarifying discriminative [obstacles], later from "that sixth consciousness" onward explaining innate [obstacles]. This is the beginning. "One mind, three minds," etc. - as already explained before. "Two grade elimination" means in these second and third two-time minds, [they] eliminate dharma-grasping, hence called "two grade elimination." Question: Among the three minds, how many are uninterrupted paths and how many are liberation paths? Explaining: There are two explanations. First, ancient people say: the first two are uninterrupted, the last one [is liberation].

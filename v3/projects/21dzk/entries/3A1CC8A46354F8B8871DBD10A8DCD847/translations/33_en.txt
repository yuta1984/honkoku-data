cause and effect." Master Jing said: "True truth refers to cessation and path. False truth refers to suffering and accumulation. The latter four重複 the previously clarified four of suffering, accumulation, cessation, and path for mutual inclusion, having two explanations." This can be understood as written.

"From 'or establishing seven truths' to 'because categories differ'": The chapter master's explanation says: "Attachment and harm refer to the two truths of accumulation and suffering. Liberation refers to cessation truth, or it extends to path truth. Dharma-nature truth is suchness. Superior understanding truth is namely superior understanding. This is its suffering fruit. What the sages know is called noble truth; what ordinary beings know is called non-noble truth." Master Jing said: "Attachment is accumulation, harm is suffering, liberation is cessation. Dharma-nature truth is namely non-established truth. Superior understanding truth is namely path truth. Noble truth is namely cessation and path. Non-noble truth is suffering and accumulation truth." Master Xing said: "All contaminated dharmas that generate loving mind are called attachment truth. Also, the essence of attachment contaminates favorable objects, therefore called attachment. The five desire objects generate greed, hatred and other faults, therefore called harm truth. Also, the essence of afflictions being harm is called harm truth. What can sever the former two is called liberation truth. Suchness dharma-nature is called dharma-nature truth. Because one generates superior faith and understanding toward suchness dharma-nature, it is called superior understanding truth. What the Tathāgata establishes is called noble truth; what outsiders establish is called non-noble truth. Observing their establishments, one does not attain sagehood." Regarding the sequence of accumulation, suffering, path, cessation in the first four: examining the meanings in the Yogācāra commentary, there seems to be some discrepancy. Therefore Master Ji's commentary says: "Liberation means cessation, or it extends to path truth. Dharma-nature means suchness." In this chapter's intention, liberation is path truth and dharma-nature is cessation truth. The text seems somewhat different, but the meaning is not contradictory. Mental understanding and contemplation refers to the fifth superior understanding truth. In the two emptiness gates,

making empty aspects and contemplating with superior understanding. What sages know is the sixth noble truth. What ordinary beings know is the seventh non-noble truth.

"From 'the first four truths' to 'can belong to initial conventional inclusion'": This discusses inclusion among the four levels, which is easy to understand. "Non-two noble truths" refers to the two truths known by ordinary beings, not the two truths known by sages, therefore called non-two noble truths.

"From 'elsewhere or establish' to 'belongs to second ultimate inclusion'": Attachment, harm, and liberation: within the five aggregates, observing the Four Noble Truths principles three times, therefore combined as three. First is attachment, namely observing accumulation truth. Second is harm, namely observing suffering truth. Third is liberation, namely observing cessation truth. Only path truth is excluded because it is the observing capability. "Should know, etc.": suffering, accumulation, cessation, path should be matched in sequence. Single and multiple observations of the four truths: single means partial meaning, multiple means cumulative meaning. The three of attachment, etc. are called multiple observation. In aggregate and other dharmas, cumulatively observing truths. The three of "should know," etc. are called single observation. In cause and effect, etc., partially observing truths. "Excluding path in the second observation": the three of attachment, etc. are called the second observation. If following textual sequence, it should be called the first. Now, contrasting single and multiple, it is called the second observation. This meaning is as extensively explained in Abhidharma-samuccaya fascicle 15, quoting the Attachment Sūtra. Tradition says single observation should be cultivated because it is the observing capability. Multiple observation is the former six truths because it is what is observed. This meaning is still difficult to understand. Those who realize should investigate.

"From 'or establishing eight truths' to 'because noble causes differ'": Among the eight, the first three correspond in sequence to the three sufferings. Although neutral feelings are numerous,

only the neutral feeling corresponding to ālaya consciousness is taken as the intrinsic characteristic of suffering of conditioning. Other neutral feelings, following association, also take pleasant feelings and the corresponding dharmas of faculties and objects as the essence of suffering of destruction. Take painful feelings and the corresponding dharmas of faculties and objects as the essence of suffering of suffering. This is because they follow differences. Saṃsāra is called flowing truth; nirvāṇa is called return-cessation truth. Another explanation: all Buddha tathāgatas manifesting transformation from the real is called flowing truth; ceasing transformation and returning to the real is called return-cessation truth. The three contaminations of birth, etc. are called contaminated truth. The unconditioned attained by severing them is called pure truth. The uncontaminated noble path that can sever them is called correct preliminary practice truth. This completes listing the categories and revealing the reasons for establishment.

"From 'the first four and the...' to 'belongs to ultimate truth inclusion'": This discusses mutual inclusion regarding the four levels. "The first four and the sixth belong to second-third conventional truths, first-second ultimate truths inclusion, etc.": The second conventional truth is namely the three categories of dharmas. The third conventional truth is namely the Four Truths principles. The first-second ultimate truths are also thus. The first three suffering truths are only suffering fruits, namely belonging to suffering truth. The fourth flowing and sixth contamination both extend to cause and effect, namely belonging to suffering-accumulation inclusion because they are contaminated cause and effect. The reason for second conventional and first ultimate inclusion is that the three contaminated categories are all of the nature of three sufferings, and also saṃsāra dharmas. Saṃsāra dharmas also extend to the three contaminations of birth, etc. Therefore the first four and sixth truth belong to second conventional truth and first ultimate inclusion. The fifth return-cessation and seventh purity belong in sequence to the inclusion of cessation-path two truths because they are pure cause and effect. This discusses essential nature. If explained through

association, the seventh purity also extends to the two emptinesses and one suchness, therefore it says "or belongs to fourth conventional, third-fourth ultimate truths inclusion." The eighth correct preliminary practice truth is namely the uncontaminated path. This is also essential nature. The third conventional truth belongs to second ultimate inclusion because it is path truth. If explained through association, it also extends to the two emptinesses and one suchness, therefore it says "fourth conventional truth, third ultimate inclusion."

"From 'in the Śrīmālā Sūtra' to 'because it is non-established'": "Conditioned and unconditioned each have four types": Hinayana truth observation, looking toward the future, still has Mahayana truth observation to be cultivated, therefore called conditioned. Mahayana truth observation, looking toward the future, has no other observation to be cultivated, therefore called unconditioned. Also called "measurable and immeasurable four truths." In Hinayana dharma, although observing the four truths, knowing general characteristics coarsely is called measurable. In Mahayana dharma, knowing individually and subtly is called immeasurable. Like knowing countless sufferings within one suffering. The three of accumulation, cessation, and path are also thus. "Corresponding to inferior and superior capacities, etc.": Accomplishing ultimately in an inferior way and attaining ultimate fruit is called inferior capacity, namely the two vehicles. Accomplishing ultimately in a vast way and attaining ultimate fruit is called superior capacity, namely bodhisattvas. These two capacities are as explained in Abhidharma treatise fascicle 16. "Depending on designation to reveal meaning is non-established because": Question: Non-established means abandoning designation for meaning. Unconditioned is also thus. Why does it now say "depending on designation to reveal meaning is non-established"? Explanation: Master Zhizhou said: "The name non-established extends to two meanings. First, only abandoning designation, different from unconditioned, namely the Yogācāra treatise's non-established truth is only one. Second, saying 'non' is namely the meaning of 'without.' Established is conditioned. Names have different meanings, but essence has no distinction."

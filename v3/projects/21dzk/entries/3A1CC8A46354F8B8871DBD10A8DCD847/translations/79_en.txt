Among the two texts proving nourishing causes, this is the second text. "Having other derived matter dependent on great elements" - in *Yogācārabhūmi* volume 54's explanation of five types of "arising of material things," this precisely reveals the meaning of the first "dependent arising." Namely, because other produced derived matter arises at the location of the supporting great elements. Thus explaining: through the four great elements producing derived matter, this is at the same location, the meaning of encompassing and maintaining them. This is called dependent arising. "Encompassed in one location" clarifies the meaning of mutual dependence. Not mutually abandoning, able to serve as support. This is precisely the great elements' second supporting function among their activities toward derived matter. Hence saying "encompassed in one location."

From "This meaning precisely reveals" to "due to superior conditions": This is the chapter compiler's explanatory text, precisely returning to explain *Prakaraṇāryavāca*'s meaning. The dependent and supporting being together in one location, hence saying "mutually dependent existence." Like separated wheel-light, etc., and the concentration-path-precept matter of the formless realm - though lacking the four great [elements], their power depends on those for existence. All are dependent causes. Therefore one can explain "mutually dependent existence." If not so, the matter of the three times would lack suspended production meaning. Some explanations say: Since the treatise text already states "encompassed in one location, named great-produced," we know this text only concerns co-substantial production, explaining the meaning of producer. I consider this incorrect. Both immediate and separated-from-great production all have dependent causes. Why prevent also explaining mutual dependence meaning regarding separated-substantial various matters? Therefore Master Ji's *Yogācārabhūmi* commentary volume 2 says: Various sunlight, etc., though separated from great elements, their power depends on those for existence. All have dependent causes. Through this we clearly know: explaining mutual dependence meaning encompasses both immediate and separated [production]. This is not determining substantial existence. Seeds producing manifest [phenomena] determine substance before producing. The dharma principle of proximate causation must be thus. Great elements

producing matter all take manifest dharmas as superior conditions. Due to mutual dependent existence, this is not determining substantial existence.

From "Analyzing dependent causation" to "twenty-six causes": Speaking of "ten causes" - *Yogācārabhūmi* volume 38 says: What are the ten causes? First, designating cause; second, depending cause; third, pulling cause; fourth, supporting cause; fifth, arising cause; sixth, developing cause; seventh, determining cause; eighth, collaborative cause; ninth, conflicting cause; tenth, non-conflicting cause. Namely, all dharmas are named as prior, hence conceptualizing; conceptualizing as prior, hence speaking. This is named those dharmas' designating cause. Depending on this, this serving as cause, in those various matters, either seeking or grasping. This is named their depending cause. Like depending on hands, hands serving as cause, having grasping activities. Depending on feet, feet serving as cause, having going-coming activities, etc. (etc.). All seeds, in relation to later self-results, are named pulling causes. Excluding seeds, the remaining various conditions are named supporting causes. Precisely those seeds, in relation to initial self-results, are named arising causes. Precisely the initial seeds' produced results, in relation to later seeds' pulled results, are named developing causes. Various different types' separate causations are named determining causes. Whether depending causes, pulling causes, supporting causes, arising causes, developing causes, or determining causes - such various causes, collectively encompassed as one, are named collaborative causes. Regarding produced dharmas, causes capable of obstruction are named conflicting causes. When these obstructing causes are either lacking or separated, [they are] named non-conflicting causes. Extensively explaining their meanings follows various commentaries' explanations. Speaking of "six causes" - *Prakaraṇāryavāca* volume 18 only lists cause names without explaining their meanings. First, similar-type cause; second,

universal cause; third, co-existent cause; fourth, corresponding cause; fifth, retribution cause; sixth, enabling cause. Explaining the six cause names - this should be resolved below.

From "Ten-cause production" to "regarding first, etc.": In analyzing ten-cause production, there are precisely two sections. First, great [elements] in relation to produced [matter], clarifying having causal characteristics. Later, produced [matter] in relation to great [elements], clarifying having causal characteristics. In the first section analyzing great [elements] in relation to produced [matter] having complete causes, there are three explanations. Following their sequence: seven, eight, nine causes. This is the first explanation, collectively having seven causes (examining treatise 8 [first left] commentary 8 original [eighth right] correspondence). First, pulling cause - precisely depending on the third habitual-energy-dependent-location to establish this cause. Namely internal-external seeds in unmatured stages - that is, contaminated/uncontaminated internal-external seeds in un-moistened times, both capable of pulling distant self-results. If pure causes: not yet moistened by good friends, etc. If defiled causes: not yet moistened by grasping-reception, etc. If neutral causes: not yet moistened by water, soil, etc. These are all habitual-energy-dependent-locations. Hence depending on these locations, establishing pulling causes. Second, arising cause - precisely depending on the fourth moistened-seed-dependent-location to establish this cause. Namely internal-external seeds in already-matured stages - the previous seeds in already-moistened times, only capable of producing-arising proximate self-results. This cause only differs from the previous in already-moistened/not-moistened, having no separate substance. "Among neutral causes, un-moistened, etc." - *Yogācārabhūmi* volume 38 says: Having ten types of causes encompassing all causes, either for defilement, or for purity, or for worldly various agriculture, etc.'s neutral dharmas' operation (above is treatise text). Explaining: The ten causes have three [types]. First, pure ten causes; second, defiled ten causes; third, neutral ten causes. Pure and defiled ten causes follow the extensive explanation below. Neutral ten causes

【Lower Section】
- neutral sounds serve as designating cause nature. Taking external grains, wheat, etc. as neutral dharmas has only possessive interpretation, also karmadhāraya interpretation. Depending on having going-coming, etc., named neutral dharmas' depending cause. Grain seeds, etc., before moistening are named pulling causes. After moistening are named arising causes. Water, soil, human effort, etc.'s mutual assistance is named supporting cause. Depending on seeds producing stems, etc., afterward is named developing cause. If wheat definitely produces wheat, not producing beans, etc., is named determining-difference cause. From depending through determining-difference cause, attracting one-matter results is named collaborative cause. Frost, snow, etc. regarding grain is named conflicting cause. Regarding arising, abiding, etc., not mutually obstructing is named non-conflicting cause. Now saying "great [elements] in relation to derived matter have seven causes" speaks about the third neutral ten causes among the three causes. Hence saying "among neutral causes." Speaking of "un-moistened, already-moistened" precisely displays the pulling and arising two causes as follows. "External grains, wheat, etc. in relation to sprouts, etc." precisely clarifies manifest in relation to manifest having two causes.

From "Third, supporting cause" to "being supported": Speaking of "supporting cause" - precisely depending on six locations to establish this cause. First, immediately-past-dependent-location - that is, mind and mental factors' immediately-preceding condition. Second, object-realm-dependent-location - substance encompasses all dharmas, results are only mind and mental factors. Third, root-dependent-location - substance is the six roots, encompassing eight consciousnesses and five roots as substance, results are only mind and mental factors. Fourth, function-dependent-location - regarding performed activities, the function of instruments, excluding seeds, the remaining active manifest conditions. Fifth, personal-effort-dependent-location - regarding performed activities, the function of agents, excluding seeds, the remaining active manifest conditions. Sixth, true-view-dependent-location - various uncontaminated views, together with all unconditioned and conditioned dharmas serving as causes. Collectively depending on these six,

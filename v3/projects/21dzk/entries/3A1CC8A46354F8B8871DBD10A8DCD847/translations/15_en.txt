Commentary by Zenshu
Two Truths Chapter

Regarding the text "The Two Truths are profound and subtle... mutual inclusion questions and answers": "The Two Truths are profound and subtle" - the Extensive Hundred Treatise, volume ten, says: "However, what the Buddha explained has nothing that is not extremely profound. The Two Truths dharma gate is fundamentally difficult to fathom." Now preserving that meaning, we say "profound and subtle." Saying "not briefly exhaustive speech" - "brief" means to select. That is, the meaning of selective abbreviation. "Exhaustive" means ultimate. That is, the meaning of without remainder. Selecting the fish trap ceases outside existence and non-existence; exhausting principle is cut off at the ford of shallow and deep. Therefore it says "not briefly exhaustive speech." In the Summary, changing to say "not brief speech exhaustive meaning" is also the same. There is an explanation that "brief" means general summary, "exhaustive meaning" means extensive and broad meaning. The Two Truths are mysterious and subtle; extensive and brief transcend speech. Brief speech cannot fathom the ultimate source; extensive speech cannot measure the fundamental depth. Therefore it says "not briefly exhaustive speech." Another explanation says: not briefly stating to vainly exhaust speech. Therefore it says "not briefly exhaustive speech." Thus the Commentary volume one says: "Speaking of the Two Truths, the principle is difficult to conceive. Now in this, we briefly show the essential points." This present text is also the same. That is, preserving the brief.

Regarding the text "The initial gate has two... the superior wisdom herein": In the Śrīmālā Sūtra establishing only One Truth, etc. - this is precisely the text from that sūtra's One Truth chapter. Master Gyō says: Among the Four Truths, three are conventional, only one is true. Truth is truth. Being only one, it is called "One Truth." The present chapter master's intention is to gather practices and return to truth, generally summarizing

One Truth. Only the Tathāgatagarbha is the One Reality. The rest have arising and cessation, or are objects of grasping. They are not the One Reality. The Yogācāra Treatise says "The non-false truth is only the fourth truth." This is precisely that meaning. In the Benevolent King Sūtra generally explaining Two Truths, etc. - that upper volume has a Two Truths chapter. Now pointing to that chapter, therefore saying "generally explaining Two Truths." The sūtra's meaning explains the mutual opposition of phenomena and principle, establishing only Two Truths. The One True Dharmadhātu is called Ultimate, the rest are called Conventional. Since the knowable dharmas already differ in superior and inferior, the knowing persons also have superior and inferior. Therefore saying "persons and dharmas each have superior and inferior." In the Nirvāṇa Sūtra each of the Two Truths has true and conventional Two Truths, etc. - precisely the Nirvāṇa Sūtra volume thirteen says: "Knowing the Ultimate Truth has two wisdoms: first is middle, second is superior. The wisdom of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas is called middle; the wisdom of buddhas and bodhisattvas is called superior." Explaining: When comparing persons, ordinary beings are inferior, the Two Vehicles are middle, the Tathāgata is superior. Due to this, persons and dharmas each divide into two levels. The reason for this is that ordinary wisdom cognizes but cannot realize, called "inferior wisdom." Now contrasting with ordinary-level wisdom, middle and superior are explained. Realizing reality is only two, therefore saying "each and every one has middle and superior wisdom." Details are as explained below.

Regarding the text "Manifestation, Middle and Edge... should be extensively distinguished below": Manifestation volume two and volume six, Middle and Edge volume two all have this text. Each of the Two Truths has three. The three conventional truths are: first, provisional conventional - initial nature has no substance, only having nominal designation, called "provisional conventional." Second, conditioned conventional - the second conditioned has superior meaning of transmigration and flow, called "conditioned conventional." Third, manifest conventional - the third conventional is manifested by the second conventional, therefore also called "conventional," yet its substance is actually not. The three ultimates are: first,

meaning ultimate. Undefiled contemplative mind is called "superior wisdom." Since this is its object realm, it is called "ultimate meaning." Meaning is precisely object. Second, attained ultimate - that is, nirvāṇa. Now saying "meaning" means precisely beneficial meaning. Because it can accord and benefit. This nirvāṇa's substance is superior fruit, establishing the superior name, ultimately attaining the attained, called "attained ultimate." Third, conditioned ultimate - wisdom is conditioned, therefore called conditioned. Taking superior dharma as meaning, called "ultimate meaning." As explained in Consciousness-Only Treatise volume eight, etc. Yogācāra and Consciousness-Only each having four - Question: Discernment sixty-four explains conventional four but does not explain true four. Consciousness-Only volume nine explains ultimate four but does not explain conventional four. How can it now say "Yogācāra and Consciousness-Only each have four"? Explaining: There are two explanations. First: The two treatises mutually correspond to distinguish the Two Truths, having four levels. Therefore saying "both each have four." Second: Yogācāra uses conventional to reflect true, Consciousness-Only uses true to reflect conventional. Mutually preserving reflection and abbreviation, therefore saying "both each have four." There are those who become confused about this meaning and erroneously speculate, saying Yogācāra and Manifestation only explain conventional four, true having only one. In the Consciousness-Only Treatise, explaining true four is merely personal private speech, not the treatise's correct meaning - this is wrong. Not only does it deviate from the meaning, it also deeply misunderstands the text. As Master Yuan says, this is truly the speech of dharma poison. Deception has already perished, street and lane sounds are not worth collecting. Since the text is concise and meaning distant, what the various treatises refer to - if one again follows and becomes familiar with such speech, I vow life after life not to encounter it, and upon attaining the patient mind, return to save this inferior body. Now examining such persons' words, there are no such examples. However, the reason Yogācāra etc. explain true as only one is that among the four levels of true, the first three do not separate from the latter three conventional, therefore not

explained. As will be reconciled below. Fearing prolixity, I temporarily stop.

Regarding the text "In this general name... the Two Truths of explanation and meaning": Formerly called First Meaning Truth, etc. - the old translated sūtras and treatises all say "Conventional Truth and First Meaning Truth." Like Kumārajīva Tripiṭaka, Master Yuan, etc., all made this explanation. "Existence and non-existence differ in substance," etc. - when the Two Truths are mutually compared, existence and non-existence differ in substance, up to explanation and meaning being separately distinct. What is this meaning? "Existence and non-existence differ in substance" means using the first conventional to contrast with the fourth true. "Phenomena and principle differ in meaning" means the second conventional contrasts with the third true. "Shallow and deep being different" means the third conventional contrasts with the second true. "Explanation and meaning separately distinct" means the fourth conventional contrasts with the first true. As explained by oneself below. Also called "name and phenomena Two Truths," etc. - should be understood according to the previous. Ximming's explanation says: The Two Truths mutually correspond, having four levels. Provisional and real Two Truths means taking armies, forests, etc. as conventional truth, taking aggregates, sense-bases, elements, etc. as ultimate truth. Second, phenomena and principle Two Truths means calling aggregates, etc. conventional, suffering, etc. ultimate. Third, Four Truths and ultimate Two Truths means taking the Four Truths of suffering, etc. as conventional truth, established suchness as ultimate truth. Fourth, established and non-established Two Truths means taking established suchness as conventional truth, non-established suchness as ultimate truth. The meaning is also the same.

Regarding the text "Conventional Truth four... non-established truth": Also called "having name but no reality truth," etc. - the Commentary calls it "nominal designation," now calling it "having name." The meaning also has no contradiction. Jars, bowls, etc. only have nominal designations but no real substance. Explained from what expresses, therefore called truth. Or the substance is actually non-existent, also called truth. Also called "following phenomena differential truth" - aggregates, realms, etc. follow their respective phenomena, establishing aggregate

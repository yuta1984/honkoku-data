essence. Hence in these various texts, treatise texts and commentary texts are mixed together to form the text. Most depend on the text of [Yogācāra] fifty-four to explain categorical differences. However, in *Yogācāra* third, long-cultivation is first and retribution listed later. In fifty-four, equal-flow is first and long-cultivation listed later. Now in this chapter, retribution is first and equal-flow listed later. This method is to embellish the text and generate scholars' understanding, so it should not be considered strange.

First, retribution categories etc. *Yogācāra* fifty-four says: "The subsequent form aggregate continues and transforms through how many kinds of flows? Namely, through three kinds: first, equal-flow flow; second, retribution-arising flow; third, long-cultivation flow." [Above is treatise text] Now in this chapter, retribution is initially listed. If following Hīnayāna, there are three explanations for categorical differences. First says: There are four categories total, namely retribution-arising, long-cultivation, equal-flow, and transformation. Second says: There are only three categories, namely retribution-arising, long-cultivation, and equal-flow. The transformation [category] is included in long-cultivation. Third says: There are only two categories, namely retribution-arising and long-cultivation. Transformation great elements enter into long-cultivation; equal-flow is included in retribution and long-cultivation. Evaluation says: Among the previous three explanations, the first is good. There are four great elements not included in the two. As explained in *Vibhāṣā* one hundred twenty-seven. The *Vibhāṣā* evaluators' meaning is identical to Mahāyāna.

"Retribution categories" means provisional and real retribution are commonly called retribution categories. Real retribution is the ālaya consciousness. From the initial moment onward, until life's end, all essentially are retribution. [They] can also be called retribution-arising, because they arise from previous momentary retribution. Master Jing says: The initial moment root-object retribution-arising matters arising from karma are immediately the same category as the previous body's root-object retribution-arising, hence named flow. "One karma-arising initially arises" etc. means the time of initial single moment arising is called retribution flow.

From the second moment onward is continuing retribution flow. *Bhūmi* third says: "Retribution-arising has two: first, retribution essence arising, corresponding to initial meaning; second, arising from retribution called retribution-arising, corresponding to continuing meaning here." By this text [we] prove the eighth ālaya is also called retribution and also called retribution-arising. However, the *Abhidharma* treatise explains retribution through provisional-real opposition. Therefore the eighth is only real retribution; other consciousnesses etc. are called retribution-arising. Hence no contradiction.

"Initial is general retribution" etc. means initial karma-arising is the result of directing karma, immediately becoming general recompense. Later continuation is the result of fulfilling karma, immediately becoming particular recompense. This distinguishes [them] in terms of recompense. Or "initial is initial moment" etc. means in the aspect of prior karma-arising there are differences of earlier-later, hence dividing two kinds of retribution. This clarifies earlier-later in terms of initial time. Extensively as in *Yogācāra Commentary*.

From "second, long-cultivation categories" to "called cultivated": "Long-cultivation categories" means through those food etc. long-cultivation conditions, causing those form-mind essence-characteristics to become flourishing. Commonly called long-cultivation. Later depending on former arising is called long-cultivation flow. "First, place extensive-pervasive" etc. - Master Kī's *Yogācāra Commentary* says: "Place extensive-pervasive means essence increasing extensively and pervasively filling locations. Characteristic flourishing means locations remain as before while appearances increasingly transform." Master Fan's *Abhidharma Commentary* says: "Place extensive-pervasive means nourishing thinness to make fat etc. Characteristic flourishing means making lustrous." [Above is commentary text] Initial place extensive-pervasive long-cultivation exists only in form dharmas. Later characteristic flourishing long-cultivation extends to form-mind. The reason for this: form has spatial location hence has initial long-cultivation; mind lacks spatial location hence lacks initial long-cultivation. Saying "food, sleep etc." - in sixty-four

there are five nourishing conditions. To these four add "avoiding unequal conditions." Also sixty-four says: "Long-cultivation has two: first, sustaining long-cultivation; second, non-damaging long-cultivation. Initial food-drink is sustaining long-cultivation. Sleep etc. three are non-damaging long-cultivation." [Above is treatise text] Root-object form dharmas, as dharmas, through food etc. four conditions obtain long-cultivation. Hence saying "cultivated by food-drink etc."

Saying "also through food hence their support etc." means other mind-mental factors' long-cultivation flow essences also through food-drink have essence-characteristics flourish. Hence saying "also through food." Others can be known by analogy. Master Kī's *Yogācāra Commentary* says: "Also through food means immediately the previous food. Their support means immediately sleep and brahmacarya. Cultivating superior attention means that immediately is concentration." [Above is commentary text] "Long-time pure maturation" - not separately raised and matched. Master Jing says: "Also through food means immediately food-drink. Their support means immediately depending on sleep. Cultivating superior attention depends on brahmacarya. Long-time pure maturation means through long-time maturely cultivating absorptions, also able to long-cultivate mind and mental factors."

From "third, equal-flow categories" to "all later two": Saying "all later two hence equal-flow flow" - the upper "flow" is flow-category. Earlier-later similar flow-categories are called equal-flow. The next lower "flow" is the meaning of flow-transformation. Master Jing says: "Speaking of reality, equal-flow flow essence is only the existing wholesome-unwholesome form-sounds outside retribution long-cultivation form, and deportment-craft-transformation existing form dharmas, and vessel-world five objects. These are equal-flow essence."

"First, retribution equal-flow" etc. - if following Hīnayāna, retribution long-cultivation are not explained as flow, because lacking essence. Outside departing from these two, then explained as flow. Now in Mahāyāna, repeatedly explaining the meaning of maturation.

Because retribution long-cultivation same-category mutual arising also has flow meaning. "Immediately previous two categories all equal-flow" means the previous retribution categories and long-cultivation categories - former accomplishes, later arises, same-category mutual arising. As explained in sequence, called retribution equal-flow. Departing from previous two categories, outside there are no separate retribution equal-flow long-cultivation equal-flow.

Saying "transformation equal-flow" also called change equal-flow. Means transforming old characteristics, like blue changing to yellow, clear changing to turbid etc. "Original-nature equal-flow" also called self-nature equal-flow. Means dwelling in old positions, continuing arising-ceasing. This is immediately the commentator's explanation. Master Jing says: "Transformation equal-flow flow - yellow color entering blue immediately transforms becoming green. Green is yellow's flow, called transformation equal-flow. Original-nature equal-flow flow - retribution long-cultivation distinctions called flow essence." Master Fan says: "Transformation equal-flow means immediately the previous retribution, long-cultivation, and self-nature three kinds equal-flow. All having long-short large-small fat-thin etc. changes called transformation equal-flow. Saying original-nature equal-flow means immediately the remaining dharmas' self-nature outside retribution long-cultivation. All called self-nature equal-flow. Saying 'retribution long-cultivation two kinds not included all later two' means excluding previous retribution long-cultivation forms, outside existing wholesome-unwholesome form-sounds deportment-craft-transformation existing form dharmas, and vessel-world five objects. These various forms altering old characteristics called transformation equal-flow. Still dwelling in old positions, continuing arising-ceasing called original-nature equal-flow. Hence saying 'previous two not included all later two'."

From "five roots only have" to "essence distinct explanations": Below this includes dharmas to gather flow abundance.

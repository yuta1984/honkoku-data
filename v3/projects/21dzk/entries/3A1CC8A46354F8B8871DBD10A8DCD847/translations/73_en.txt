[elements] produce [derived forms]?" Answer: One should explain thus: "producing" means causal meaning. Though the five causes of similar [type], etc. are all absent, there are separately other five types of causal meanings - namely the five types of causes: origination, dependence, etc. If following Mahāyāna, both causal production and conditional production can be obtained, hence [it] pervades conditional meaning. Master Fan says: Speaking of "derived," "producing" means the meaning of making. Cause is capable of making; effect is the meaning of being made - this is also acceptable. Speaking of "derived is form" corresponds to the above-cited text "other derived forms arise." "Forms derived by great elements" corresponds to the above-cited text "depending on great elements." Through this, [we] precisely prove the meaning of the two explanations: descriptive and possessive.

From "distinctive names" to "is wind meaning": *Yogācārabhūmi* 54 says: "Form aggregates have six characteristics: first, individual characteristics; second, common characteristics; third, mutually dependent characteristics; fourth, experiential characteristics; fifth, operational characteristics; sixth, subtle characteristics. Individual characteristics means earth, etc. have firmness, etc. as characteristics; eyes, etc. have individually distinct pure forms as characteristics." The other five are as explained there. Now saying "firm-solid meaning is earth meaning, etc." reveals precisely the first individual characteristic among the six characteristics. *Prakaraṇāryavāca* is also the same. However, examining *Yogācārabhūmi*, *Prakaraṇāryavāca*, *Vibhāṣā*, *Abhidharmakośa*, *Abhidharmasamuccaya*, etc., the texts each differ slightly, but the meanings are all the same. However, this text saying "firm-solid meaning is earth meaning, etc." mostly takes the *Abhidharmasamuccaya* text. Hence that text says: "Earth realm is firm-solid nature... up to wind realm is light-moving nature." Here saying "flowing but not wet" means copper, iron, etc. when extremely burned by fire immediately melt into water. "Being wet but not flowing" exists like water in vessels, etc. This text explains both [positive and negative] cases, hence saying "manifesting flowing." Saying "light-equal-moving nature" - in the *Abhidharmasamuccaya* text, [it] only says "light-moving nature" without the word "equal." However, *Abhidharmakośa* cites *Prakaraṇapāda* to prove that wind

realm [has] movement as nature: "How is [it] named wind realm? Namely light-equal-moving nature." Now taking that text, hence placing the word "equal." Master Guang says: Speaking of "light-equal" means though this is derived touch, wind realm's essential nature is similar to lightness, hence saying "light-equal." Though wind's essence is movement, saying "light" is because wind's moving nature is subtle and difficult to know, hence [we] manifest moving nature through light characteristics - the meaning of manifesting cause through function. Hence *Nyāyānusāra* says: "Light as wind" raises effect to manifest cause, because [it] is wind's effect. Question: If fire and wind increase causing lightness, why only speak of wind as light's cause? Explanation: Wind universally serves as light's cause, but fire does not pervade. Like willow catkins, etc. being carried up in lightness - fire is not increased. Hence separately raising lightness particularly manifests wind realm.

From "that earth is great" to "explained in chapter": This uses the six explanations to clarify obtaining names. "Derived forms' distinctive names [explained] in chapter" - which chapter does this indicate? Explanation: *Abhidharmasamuccaya* 1 says: "Derived forms are the five sense organs of eyes, etc., a portion of form, sound, smell, taste, tangibles, and forms included in the mind-object realm." In that treatise, [it] separately explains derived [forms] with three textual divisions: first the five sense organs, next the five objects, finally mind-realm forms. Now in this chapter, [we] only clarify the two chapters of five sense organs and mind-realm, briefly not explaining the five objects chapter. The reason for this is that Master Ji's *Abhidharmasamuccaya* commentary volume 2 opens many sections explaining five object meanings - [it] has already been extensively explained there, hence [this] is abbreviated. Now [we] indicate the five sense organs chapter, etc. below, hence saying "explained in chapter." Some say now this present chapter is named "Productive Great Elements Chapter," titled "Great Elements and Derived Forms Chapter" - [this] partially indicates the productive. Next [we] should further explain derived

forms, etc. chapters. Now [we] indicate those, hence saying "derived forms' distinctive names [explained] in chapter." The latter explanation is difficult to understand, hence [we] preserve the first explanation.

From "five causes of origination, etc." to "definitely cannot arise": From "derived [forms]" to "hence forms do not arise" is *Abhidharmasamuccaya* text. From "all derived forms" below is the chapter compiler's text. "Causes of origination, dependence, establishment, maintenance, nourishment, etc." - Master Fan says: Among these five causes, "origination" concerns the unarisen arising; "dependence" concerns transforming based on those productive [elements]; "establishment" concerns accomplishing those effects following great [elements'] transformations; "maintenance" concerns maintaining effects to make [them] abide; "nourishment" concerns nourishing effects to make [them] grow. If regarding the six explanations, these five causes - if causes of origination - are possessive compounds; if origination being causes - are descriptive compounds. Possessive origination belongs to effects; descriptive origination belongs to causes. The other four are similarly so. "Origination cause is arising cause" - Question: Origination and arising are different names for the same thing. Based on what [do we] make correspondences? Explanation: Master Fan gives two explanations. First, taking arising meaning briefly explains the name "origination," hence saying "origination cause is arising cause." Second, using *Yogācārabhūmi*'s origination cause to correspond with the arising cause possessed by the original treasury. The lower four are also thus. *Yogācārabhūmi* 3 also explains causes - text differs but meaning is the same, as extensively explained there. "All derived forms, though arising from their own seeds, etc." - this is the chapter compiler explaining *Abhidharmasamuccaya*'s arising meaning.

From "*Yogācārabhūmi* 3" to "explaining this same [principle]": Examining *Yogācārabhūmi*'s original text, the text appears slightly different, but this chapter compiler takes the meaning and adorns the text, hence [there is] nothing strange. "Seeds of inner and outer great elements and derived forms" refers to seeds of the three realms, three natures, newly perfumed and originally existing, etc. "Inner continuous mind" refers to the eighth consciousness. [We] distinguish [it] from the seven transforming consciousnesses, hence named "continuous." Another explanation: the dependent body is named "continuous" - namely the eighth

【Lower Section】
mind abiding within the body, hence named "continuous mind." "Necessarily great element seeds first produce great elements, derived form seeds then produce derived forms" - *Vijñāptimātratā* commentary 1 says: "Aspects have separate seeds - why [are they] called consciousness transformations? Because [they] do not separate from consciousness. Because aspects arise only when consciousness transforms. Like great [elements] producing forms" - [this] indicates this text. The reason is: self-essence and aspectual portions each arise from separate seeds - how do aspectual portions become transformed by consciousness? Explanation: If consciousness essence's seeds have not yet produced consciousness manifestation, aspectual portion seeds ultimately do not produce aspects. Necessarily consciousness seeds first produce consciousness manifestation, then aspectual portion seeds produce aspectual portions. Because consciousness self-essence serves as forerunner, hence [we] speak of it as capable of transformation. Through this the commentary says "like great [elements] producing forms." Question: If so, mind is productive, aspects are produced. If [we] permit this, how [can we] permit mind to be great elements? Explanation: Mental dharmas do not possess the four meanings of great elements, hence [are] not great elements. If regarding productive meaning, mind is also named "productive." Hence *Avataṃsaka* says: "All dharmas of the three realms are produced by mind alone." *Daśabhūmi* also says: "All three realms are made by mind alone." "Making" and "producing" have the same meaning. Saying "because [it serves as] forerunner, [we] speak of it as capable of production" - this means being supported by that productive [function] and obtaining arising, hence provisionally speaking of production. Through this [we] should know: the five causes of origination, etc. are only remote, not proximate - regarding manifest [phenomena] in mutual relation, [they serve as] predominant conditions. "*[Yogācārabhūmi]* 66 explains this same [principle]" - *Yogācārabhūmi* 66 says: "Question: Like the four great elements obtaining arising through their own seeds, derived forms are also thus. Why [do we] say all derived forms are produced by great elements? Answer: If various form sense organs and body have great element seeds following [them], then [there] are derived form seeds following [them]. If the great elements' possessed

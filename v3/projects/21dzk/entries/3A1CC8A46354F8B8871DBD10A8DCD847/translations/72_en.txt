The meaning of "production" explains "element." The other three meanings all explain the meaning of "great." As explained in that commentary. According to the chapter compiler's intention, these four meanings all explain the meaning of "great," hence saying "great has four meanings." Regarding "first, serving as support, etc.": Question: Where are the four great [elements] located in relation to derived forms to be called "supporting nature"? Explanation: *Vibhāṣā* 127 says: "Some say [they are] below serving as causes, because supporting dharmas should be thus." Question: If so, one can speak of "capable of producing" for proximate forms, but how do [they] produce distant ones? Answer: [We] do not say that all great elements of one tree are entirely below producing all derived forms. [We] simply say that each part of a tree has great elements below and derived forms above. Some make this explanation: dwelling intermixed, great elements are below, derived forms are in the middle. Question: If so, when cutting, one should see cavities, just like cutting lotus root. Answer: Though there are cavities, [they] cannot be seen, because the great elements are not visible. The visible cavities are derived forms. Second, "because essence-nature is vast, etc.": Each derived [form] has four great [elements] - this is the vast meaning. *Vibhāṣā* says: "Bodily characteristics and measurements pervade all regions and accomplish great enterprises - this is the great meaning." Third, "because formal characteristics are great, etc.": Like great earth and great mountains where earth is abundant, great rivers and great seas where water is abundant, blazing furnaces and fierce flames where fire is abundant, dark winds and whirling winds where wind is abundant - this is the meaning of great characteristics. Fourth, "because [they] generate great functions, etc.": Like fire, water, and wind disasters that, in their sequence, can destroy the second and third concentrations - this is the meaning of great function in destroying worlds. Earth can support and maintain worlds - this is the meaning of great function in forming worlds. Hence saying "because the function of forming and destroying worlds is great." *Vibhāṣā* says: "Serving as support for great

accumulated derived forms, causing destruction and formation - this is great enterprise."

From "element means causal meaning" to "because types are different": "Element means causal meaning, etc." refers to *Yogācārabhūmi* volume 3 saying "serving as element for production" - this explains causal element meaning. That is, [serving] with derived [forms] as causal elements for production, etc. "Element" pervades both manifest activity and latent dispositions. Now regarding manifest activity, [we] explain causal element meaning. This is precisely dependent origination among the five types of origination. Also [these are] the mutually dependent characteristics and operational characteristics among the five characteristics, as explained in *Yogācārabhūmi* 54 and *Prakaraṇāryavāca* 5. Also *Vibhāṣā* 127 says: "Question: What is element meaning? Answer: Capable of decreasing and increasing, capable of harming and benefiting, essence having arising and cessation - this is element meaning." [This] distinguishes from permanent dharmas to explain element meaning. Extensively as explained there. "Because types are different" means because the four types of earth, water, fire, wind are different. According to transmission, as explained above, among the four meanings of great, the first two concern essential four great [elements], the latter two concern phenomenal four great [elements]. The first three pervade the four great [elements]; the latter excludes earth and pervades the other three. Also in that record, describing Hīnayāna doctrine: "World formation [involves] only water and wind; world destruction excludes earth and pervades three, because earth is what is contained." The rest follows that record. Saying the latter two concern phenomenal four great [elements] - [I] have not examined this principle thoroughly. In Mahāyāna Master Ji's *Abhidharma* commentary and this chapter, [they] do not distinguish essential and phenomenal, but generally explain great meaning. Based on what can [we] know the latter two concern phenomena? Moreover, world formation and destruction are the power of essential greatness - how could [one] rely on phenomenal greatness to generate these great functions? Therefore know [this view is] incorrect.

From "though space is great" to "namely contextual explanation": "Though space is great, etc." - this distinguishes other

dharmas to explain the name "great elements." *Mahāvibhāṣā* 227 says: "Some say [this is] to stop what heretics say. Namely, heretics say there are five great elements - the previous four plus space. Now [we] only explain four, clarifying that space is not a great element." Question: Why doesn't space establish great elements? Vasumitra explains: Because space lacks great element characteristics. Namely, having increase and decrease are great element characteristics; having no increase or decrease are space characteristics. Having harm and benefit are great element characteristics; having no harm or benefit are space characteristics. Therefore space does not establish great elements. Ghoṣa explains: Space and great elements have different characteristics. Namely, the great elements in sentient beings' bodies are mostly produced by previous karmic retribution. Space's essence has no retributive production meaning. Through this, space does not establish great elements. The Great Virtue said: Though space is great, its essence is not an element because [it] cannot produce. Other conditioned dharmas, though capable of being elements, are not great because [their] characteristics do not pervade. Through this, space does not establish great elements. Now in this chapter, [we] agree with the Great Virtue's meaning. "Other dharmas are neither great nor elements" refers to derived forms, etc. Question: If so, the space-one visible form has characteristics pervading aggregates - how is [it] not great? Explanation: Though space-one visible form is characteristically great, [it] lacks the other three meanings, hence is not a great element.

From "derived form names" to "derived is form": *Prakaraṇāryavāca* 5 extensively explains the four types of establishment of form aggregates. Now this citation of "depending on great elements, etc." explains the second origination establishment. This is the text of the first dependent origination among the five types of origination. Hence that text says: "Origination establishment has five types of origination: first, dependent origination; second, seed origination; third, power-drawing origination; fourth, accordance-benefit origination; fifth, opposition-

harm origination. Dependent origination means depending on great elements - at the location of great elements, other existing derived forms arise. Through this cause, [we] say the four great elements produce derived forms." The other four originations follow the treatise's extensive explanation. The reason for citing text is to reveal two explanations. "Depending on great elements" demonstrates possessive compound. "Other derived forms arising" clarifies descriptive compound. This first cites text as proof, then clarifies the two compounds. If not so, what probative principle would the cited text have? "Derived is form" is the chapter compiler's text, clarifying descriptive meaning. In the cited text, the possessive meaning has easily understood textual appearance - namely "depending on great elements." The descriptive meaning has somewhat hidden text. Now [we] explain following the difficulty, hence saying "derived is form." This text is profound - scholars should contemplate.

From "*[Yogācārabhūmi]* 54 says" to "taking possessive as designation": "Named as producing" below is text added by the chapter compiler, not treatise text. *Yogācārabhūmi* 54 and *Prakaraṇāryavāca* 5 both explain the five originations. Now saying "this is the meaning of gathering and maintaining in the same location" is the final text explaining dependent origination. This correctly explains producing meaning, because gathering-maintaining meaning is producing meaning. [This] explains holding-cause meaning among the five causes. *Prakaraṇāryavāca* says: "Gathering in one location is producing meaning" - the intention is also the same. *Vibhāṣā* 127 says: "Question: What is the meaning of 'producing'? Is [it] causal meaning or conditional meaning? Either way has faults; [we] see problems with both. If causal meaning, these four great elements have none of the five causes regarding derived forms - how can [we] say [they] can produce various forms? If conditional meaning, all derived forms, each excluding its own essence, have no dharmas among all remaining dharmas that are not predominant conditions - how can [we] only say great

Since there is nothing that has never been attained, on what basis can one obtain the doctrine of advancement paths?
Answer: Taking the same example as the stages of the two vehicles and bodhisattvas, it is explained as advancement. Like the Buddha's cessation absorption, although there are no coarse mental factors in the Buddha stage, one can still speak of having cessation absorption.

"Based on this explanation, up to 'none explain the capable'": If [considering] the holy paths of the two vehicles, both contaminated and uncontaminated have four paths, but ordinary beings have only contaminated paths. Among these four paths of contaminated and uncontaminated, only uninterrupted and liberation [paths] serve as eliminating paths, because they eliminate afflictions and latent tendencies. Preparatory and advancement [paths] do not directly eliminate. However, preparatory paths have distant and near [aspects]. The near ones can also gradually suppress and eliminate. Advancement already has two approaches - general and specific; specific is not elimination, but general also extends to capability, as already explained above. This explains the two vehicles and ordinary beings. For bodhisattva vehicle preparatory and advancement [paths], they can also eliminate.

"Bodhisattvas have sharp faculties, yet there are differences": Since bodhisattvas complete the four paths moment by moment, each can either suppress or eliminate. "Suppression [affects] only obstacle-essence; elimination also extends to karmic results" means: The *Yogācāra* treatise says: "Analytical cessation has two [types]: first, uninterrupted [cessation] eliminating afflictions; second, uninterrupted [cessation] eliminating results." Calling karma "elimination" explains according to non-arising. Elimination necessarily realizes truth, etc. - elimination necessarily realizes truth; suppression sometimes relates to conventional [truth]. When bodhisattvas suppress obstacles, they can also realize truth. Ordinary beings definitely cannot. The two vehicles sometimes can. The reason is: ordinary beings have not yet attained the uncontaminated; the two vehicles have already attained it. "Yet there are differences" - there are two

explanations. First: This text belongs above. The reason is: when the two vehicles and ordinary beings eliminate obstacles, each has differences. Briefly, there are three categories: First, eliminating eighty-one categories separately - this depends on gradual elimination by two-vehicle practitioners and ordinary beings. Second, according to their ordinary stages, having already suppressed more or less, after entering seeing, they eliminate sequentially, like partial detachment and complete detachment from desire, etc. Third, combining into nine categories for elimination - taking all afflictions of the three realms and nine grounds, generally eliminating as nine categories, like sudden liberation, etc. Due to these categorical differences, it says "yet there are differences." Another explanation: This text belongs below. Regarding the four contaminated paths, when initially arising to suppress afflictions, there are two masters' doctrines, as explained below. Since the present [text] preserves that meaning, it says "yet there are differences."

"The four contaminated paths, only through detachment can elimination occur": "Three wisdoms as preparatory" reveals distant preparatory [practice]. "Cultivation wisdom as near" reveals near preparatory [practice].
Question: If cultivation wisdom is near, one should immediately say "two wisdoms as preparatory." Why does it now say "three wisdoms as preparatory"?
Answer: Cultivation wisdom has two [types]. First, not yet continuous - namely cultivation wisdom included in understanding-characteristics attention. Therefore the *Abhidharma* says "through concentrated attention." Using this text as proof, we know that understanding-characteristics attention is essentially not learning-reflection. Though it is cultivation wisdom, because it has not yet become continuous and specialized, it becomes scattered wholesomeness, being mixed with learning and reflection. Generally speaking, it says "three wisdoms as preparatory." Second, already continuous - namely cultivation wisdom included in superior understanding attention. Therefore the *Abhidharma* says: "From here upward, it transcends learning and reflection." Superior understanding attention is not mixed with learning and reflection, being entirely long-term cultivation wisdom. Now saying "cultivation wisdom as

near" explains based on this. This text is rather profound; students should contemplate it. "Preparatory paths also suppress afflictions, etc." is precisely the text from *Abhidharma* fascicle nine. "Preparatory paths also suppress afflictions" is the later text. "Understanding-characteristics and superior understanding do not yet eliminate afflictions, etc." is the earlier text. Now combining earlier and later into one text. Speaking of "understanding-characteristics and superior understanding" means understanding that desire realm's faults are coarse characteristics and first meditation's merits are peaceful characteristics, therefore called "understanding-characteristics." Repeatedly cultivating peaceful and other characteristics without being mixed with learning and reflection, arousing enhanced superior understanding, therefore called "superior understanding attention." Through long-term cultivation of this superior understanding, when its actual enhancement initially allows inferior antidotes to arise and eliminate superior afflictions, the attention accompanying that eliminating path is explained and called "detachment attention." The remaining four attentions should be understood below.

"One doctrine initially, up to actually initially suppresses": This master's meaning reveals that preparatory [paths] are only learning-reflection wisdom. When entering cultivation wisdom, it becomes uninterrupted path. When *Abhidharma* and others explain that understanding-characteristics and superior understanding don't suppress afflictions, they explain based on eliminating the initial three categories not yet being complete. When reaching detachment time, the three categories are finally complete. At this time one obtains the name "suppression." Actually, the initial two can also [suppress]. The *Compendium* says: "Examining this later explanation, though reasonable in principle, it contradicts *Yogācāra*'s text matching seven attentions with four paths." Therefore [fascicle] sixty-two says: "Understanding-characteristics and superior understanding belong to skillful means paths; detachment and ultimate belong to uninterrupted paths; joyful inclusion attention belongs to four kinds of paths; observation attention belongs to advancement paths." Since it says "skillful means path inclusion," we know understanding-characteristics and superior understanding do not yet suppress afflictions. This master generally says: *Yogācāra* thirty-

three says: "Understanding-characteristics and superior understanding are called disgust-destruction antidotes." Therefore we know they suppress afflictions.

"If for truth contemplation, up to uncontaminated preparatory": When entering seeing path for truth contemplation, the previous six-fold wisdom are all not suppressing paths, because when suppressing seeing afflictions, there is no aspiration or disgust. "Preparatory [paths] can suppress, etc." - preparatory [paths] precisely contemplate the sixteen aspects of four truths. Since they necessarily use the sixteen aspects as preliminary preparatory [practices], though they are contaminated, they can suppress because uninterruptedly they can induce uncontaminated paths. "Because there is no forceful suppression in contaminated paths" - namely in the stage when preparatory wisdom arises, advancing to the uncontaminated, though the power can suppress afflictions, because there is no intentional suppression, saying "no forceful suppression" means it is not a proper suppressing stage. "Later times also extend to cultivation wisdom preparatory" - namely extending to both uncontaminated cultivation wisdom and preparatory [paths]. Therefore when uncontaminated paths initially arise, they necessarily use contaminated cultivation as preliminary preparatory paths. When the uncontaminated arises, it belongs to uninterrupted paths because it eliminates afflictions. Reaching later times in cultivation path stage, one can also use uncontaminated paths as preliminary preparatory [practices]. Though arousing uncontaminated paths, one does not yet say "immediately eliminating afflictions." Therefore during the uneliminated interval, it is preparatory, so it says "later times also attain uncontaminated preparatory."

"However preparatory wisdom, up to as in ordinary analysis": However, preparatory paths definitely extend through three wisdoms. Preparatory wisdom does not necessarily extend through all four paths. "Though eighth ground and above lack preparatory wisdom, etc." - this addresses objections.
Question: If preparatory wisdom necessarily extends through four paths, since eighth ground and above lack preparatory wisdom, how can there be four paths?
Therefore it now generally says: Among the four paths, naturally

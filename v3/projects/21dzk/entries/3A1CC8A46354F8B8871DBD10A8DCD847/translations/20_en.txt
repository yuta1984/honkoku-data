pratyekabuddha bodhi. Through superior wisdom observation, one attains unsurpassed bodhi"? Explanation: That text merely clarifies the different meanings of three grades when the three vehicles are compared with each other. Now the two vehicles of Lesser Vehicle are considered middle-grade wisdom when compared with ordinary beings. Since the objects of comparison differ, there is no contradiction.

Regarding the text "śrāvaka vehicle two... because of realizing true-suchness": "śrāvakas mostly practice three-meaning observation" means pāramitā śrāvakas not only practice three-meaning observation but also combine it with dependent origination observation etc. Therefore it's called "mostly." Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā treatise volume 108 says: "As explained regarding seven-place goodness and three-meaning observation, one can quickly exhaust all afflictions in this Dharma and Vinaya." Explanation: Three-meaning observation means sequentially observing aggregates, sense-bases, and realms. Seven-place goodness means observing form's suffering, observing form's arising, observing form's cessation, observing form's path, observing form's attractive taste, observing form's dangers, observing form's escape. The first four observe form's four truths. Form's attractive taste repeatedly observes form's arising; form's dangers repeatedly observe form's suffering; form's escape repeatedly observes form's cessation truth. First observing arising follows the sequence of explanation. Not mentioning path is because most able-to-observe are path. The same applies to sensation, perception, formations, and consciousness, each having seven. Should say thirty-five, but since not exceeding seven, only say "seven-place goodness." Question: Among the three vehicles, which vehicle observes three-meanings and seven-places? Explanation: Three-meanings and seven-places are all practiced by śrāvakas. Buddha and pratyekabuddhas don't practice them. Question: In which stage does one generate this observation? Explanation: After mixed-object dharma-mindfulness and before general mindfulness in preparatory stages, these two types arise, as explained in Abhidharmanyāyānusāra treatise sixty-one. Question: Are three-meaning observation and seven-place goodness contaminated or uncontaminated? Question: If so, why does

truly knowing form involve four wisdoms - namely dharma-cognition wisdom, subsequent-cognition wisdom, and conventional suffering wisdom - already called "conventional wisdom," yet how is seven-place goodness only uncontaminated? Explanation: Though this conventional wisdom may also be contained, it doesn't manifest. Therefore explained as "uncontaminated." The mutual questions and answers of these two observations and discriminations of various aspects are as explained in Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā volume 108, Abhidharmanyāyānusāra treatise sixty-one, Master Guang's Abhidharmakośa commentary, etc.

Regarding the text "first worldly... explained according to objects": "Second and third conventional truths etc. mostly explained according to śrāvaka objects" means three categories and four truths are mostly śrāvaka objects. If explained according to pratyekabuddha objects, the second and third conventional would be: twelve dependent origination links as second conventional, seventy-seven wisdoms etc. as third conventional. If explained according to bodhisattva objects, the second and third truths would be: ten skillful means etc. as second conventional, consciousness-only principles etc. as third conventional. However, various treatises mostly explain according to śrāvaka objects, therefore only speak of three categories and four truths as second and third truths.

Regarding the text "pratyekabuddha vehicle two... this as object": "Superior and inferior faculties" means when comparing the two vehicles, pratyekabuddhas are superior and śrāvakas inferior. If compared with bodhisattvas, both become inferior grade because superior vehicles have distinctions. "Not grasping dharmas etc. doesn't obstruct results" - from this text we know the four levels of two vehicles don't completely include dharmas. The reason: imagined real self is included in the first level, but which level includes imagined real dharmas? Among second principled conventional truth, twelve dependent origination links begin with ignorance and end with aging-death, making twelve. "Existence" means three existences; "links" means causal meaning and divisional meaning. Twelve

dharmas serve as causes of three existences, hence called "twelve dependent origination links." Also, former links create conditional causes for latter links, hence causal meaning. Twelve dharmas are divided and different, hence divisional meaning. Among twelve links: ignorance only takes present and seed ignorance within formation aggregate as substance, not taking excluding dharmas. Second, formation links are three karmas like merit, also encompassing present and seed. Third, consciousness link only takes ālaya-vijñāna's proximate causes as substance, being master of karmic results. This is only seeds, not taking manifest activity. Mahāyānasaṃgraha treatise nine saying "six consciousnesses as consciousness link" is accommodating principle approach. Fourth, name-form link takes contaminated five aggregates as substance, encompassing both karmic result and non-karmic result. Fifth, six sense-base link is only neutral nature's internal six bases, only taking their karmic result seeds. Sixth, contact link excludes seventh consciousness; remaining eighth consciousness's associated contact entirely. If regarding stages, contact factors existing after six-base stage are precisely this substance. Seventh, sensation link has same substance as previous contact, only existing in seed stage. Eighth, craving link means three-realm craving, also encompassing present and seed. Ninth, grasping link generally takes all afflictions, also encompassing present and seed. Tenth, existence link takes previous formations and five result seeds, moistened by craving and grasping, already transforming is called existence. This is only seeds. Eleventh, birth link is five results' manifest activity, taking karmic result five aggregates as substance. Twelfth, aging-death link is same as previous birth link. Extensively as explained in Yogācāra nine and ten, ninety-three, Abhidharmasamuccaya four, Daśabhūmika eight, Vasubandhu's Twelve Dependent Origination Treatise, etc. "Pratyekabuddhas mostly condition this as conditions" means rhinoceros-horn pratyekabuddhas not only practice dependent origination observation but also perform three-meaning observation. Therefore called "mostly."

Regarding the text "third realization... person-emptiness true-suchness": Regarding "contaminated reverse observation etc.," some versions say "contaminated forward-reverse," meaning also good. Forward-reverse has two types. First, defiled forward-reverse: observing according to cyclic sequence is called "defiled forward" - namely ignorance conditions formations up to birth conditions aging-death. Or observing according to established four truths is called "defiled reverse" - namely aging-death's suffering, aging-death's arising, aging-death's cessation, aging-death's path leading to cessation. Pure forward-reverse: ignorance ceasing causes formations to cease, up to birth ceasing causes aging-death to cease, called "pure forward." Due to whose non-existence aging-death doesn't exist, due to whose cessation aging-death ceases, called "pure reverse," as explained in Abhidharmasamuccaya treatise four. Question: Based on what are forward-reverse names established? Explanation: There are three pairs. First, cause-effect correlation: first cause then effect is called forward, according to generation principle. Opposite is called reverse. Second, subtle-gross correlation: first subtle then gross is called forward, according to accumulation principle. Opposite is called reverse. Third, near-far correlation: first near then far is called forward, according to observation fitting principle. Opposite is called reverse. Therefore Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā twenty-three says: "Using causes to infer effects is called forward observation; using effects to infer causes is called reverse observation. Furthermore, entering from subtle to gross is called forward observation; entering from gross to subtle is called reverse observation. Furthermore, using near to observe far is called forward observation; using far to observe near is called reverse observation." Question: In reverse observation, what does "uniformly returning to consciousness" mean? Explanation: Yogācāra ninety-three says: "Knowing causes, taking consciousness arisen from previous accumulation as boundary. Present dharma suffering exists - already knowing it arose from previous accumulation, shouldn't further observe how this exists." Explanation: Previously already inferring three dharmas of later stage existence, grasping, craving etc., depending on previous accumulation truth's arising, present consciousness etc. five, according to

[they are] named "equal activity." Mutually assisting each other, each able to serve as cause, hence named "equal activity cause." Great [elements] are not mind etc., hence facing derived [matter] there is no corresponding cause. Various defilements of seeing and cultivation universally pervade defiled realms, able to increase their power, named "universal cause." Great [elements] are not afflictions, hence lacking this cause.

From "derived matter facing greats" to "able to attract greats": Below there are two explanations. This is the first explanation. First, productive causes etc. - it's not only that greats facing derived matter have this productive [cause], but also derived [matter] facing greats is not without this cause. The reason for this is that this productive cause is broad and non-obstructing. Second, simultaneous causes etc. - following their clusters, whether one productive great [element] or one derived matter also necessarily co-operate. Mutually assisting, not obtaining separation. Depending on this majority [principle], it explains that great elements and derived [matter] mutually do not separate, not obtaining colors that are not created by greats. Productive and produced mutually become causes and mutually become results. [This is] not the meaning of obtaining the same result. Hence having this cause. The reason for this is that productive and produced uniformly do not separate. Third, retribution causes etc. - causes extend to wholesome and unwholesome, results are only neutral. This is named retribution cause. That is, depending on bodily and verbal wholesome-unwholesome karmic seeds, able to sense retribution's four great elements. The reason for this is that these retribution causes are conditioned wholesome-unwholesome seeds. If neutral-natured nominal seeds producing retribution are similar-type causes, not retribution causes. Derived matter facing great elements becoming retribution causes is to manifest this meaning. Hence saying "disciplinary non-disciplinary meaning" - able to attract great elements. And concentration-accompanied precepts - taking only concentration precepts and

not indicating no-outflow precepts is because no-outflow does not sense retribution results. By this one should know that now saying "concentration-accompanied precepts" takes only conditioned concentration-accompanied precepts, not taking no-outflow concentration-accompanied precepts. No-outflow does not sense retribution results.

From "or becoming four causes" to "the rest can be known": This is the second explanation. The reason for adding similar-type causes is that similar-type causes have two [types]: First, causal-condition inclusion, like seeds facing manifestations, seeds facing seeds, etc. Second, non-causal-condition inclusion, like manifestations facing manifestations, etc. Derived matter facing great elements having similar-type causes means manifestations mutually facing become similar-type causes. Saying "like引发" means using similar-type causes to obtain equal-flow results has two types. First, similar-types included in arising causes equally obtain equal-flow results. As Yogācāra treatise sixty-six says: "Arising causes having equal-flow results are named result-having dharmas." Using this text to prove both simultaneous and successive [relations] are all similar-type causes. Second, similar-type causes included in引发causes obtain equal-flow results. As the treatise says: "Using previous seed-produced results facing later seed-attracted results, named引发causes obtaining equal-flow results." Hence knowing: manifestations' successive mutual-facing are also similar-type causes. Now indicating similar-type causes obtaining equal-flow results in later引发causes, hence saying "like引发causes." "The rest can be known" means those derived matters are not mind and mental factors, hence lacking corresponding causes. Not being affliction-natured, hence lacking universal causes. These distinctions are as explained in the previous [section on] greats facing derived [matter]. Hence not further distinguishing. Hence saying "the rest can be known."

From "this explains same-world" to "not different worlds": From here below explains great-derived meaning regarding worlds. Within this are two [parts]: first indicating one's own school, later from "hence should only be like what's explained here" below, generally concluding one's own school while

simultaneously distinguishing Hīnayāna. In initially indicating one's own school are two [parts]: first clarifying same-world creation meaning, later from "only disciplinary [precepts]" below clarifying different-world creation meaning. This is the initial [part]. In Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna both explain same-world different-world creation meaning. The two schools explain similarly but meanings differ. Hīnayāna's explained same-world creation and different-world creation meanings are as extensively explained in *Vibhāṣā* one hundred thirty-two. Now in this chapter only Mahāyāna meaning is explained. All resistant derived matters etc. are necessarily same-world created, not different-world created. All non-resistant non-manifest matters etc. are also different-world created, not necessarily same-world. As previously explained, greats facing derived matter have only three causes, derived matter facing greats also becoming three causes - this only refers to resistant derived matters in various cluster-locations and present-world non-resistant non-manifest matters etc., explaining having three causes. Hence saying "this explains same-world, not separate-world creation." Saying "depending on locations and existing etc." - "locations" means cluster-locations like stones, gems, etc. Hence *Abhidharma* treatise volume four says: "Like four great elements and derived matters, following what's appropriate, not all clusters definitely having four greats and matter-derived [elements]. If at that location having such quantity, these necessarily arise simultaneously, mutually inseparable." Already saying "if at that location having such quantity," clearly knowing locations are cluster-locations.

From "only disciplinary matters" to "great-derived both wholesome": This second [part] clarifies different-world creation meaning. "Only disciplinary matters" - "only" means distinguishing-maintaining meaning. Distinguishing away resistant matters etc. in same-world creation, maintaining non-resistant matters etc. in different-world creation. Hence indicating the word "only." Non-manifest dharmas - depending on precept-wholesome power, seven non-[virtues] do not arise. Prevented non-[virtues] are named "non-manifest." Already following what's prevented, provisionally named matter.

【Lower Section】
Hence following their prevented great-derived [elements]. Those prevented non-[virtues] exist in past worlds; these preventing precepts exist in present worlds. Hence past greats immediately create present matters, thus also extending to different-world creation. Conditioned form-sounds being only neutral-natured etc. - this temporarily regarding retribution causes manifests different-world creation meaning. Now saying "conditioned form-sounds being only neutral-natured" follows above, fully stating "conditioned form-sounds being only neutral-natured, provisional natures extending to three [natures]." Hence above in the essence-determination section says "conditioned derived matters being only neutral-natured, provisional natures extending to three." Hence knowing the text is abbreviated. Wholesome-unwholesome derived matters facing neutral greats immediately become retribution causes. Previous-world created karma later senses those results. Commentary volume one says: Retribution has many meanings. First, transforming and ripening - essentially when causes transform, results then ripen. This meaning extends to others; when seeds produce results, all transform. Second, different-time ripening - different time from causes, results then ripen. Present Mahāyāna regarding creation time, not regarding seed-essence, permits same-world. Third, different-type ripening - different nature from causes, results recompense causes. Now in this chapter, derived matter facing greats becoming retribution causes explains according to the second different-time ripening named retribution. Non-manifest matters also different-world created. Other resistant matters should be known by analogy. This meaning is profound and subtle; scholars should contemplate.

From "hence should only be like" to "past-future being non-existent": From here below is the second [part], generally concluding one's own meaning while distinguishing Hīnayāna. According to Sarvāstivāda, three-world various matters each same-world created, and following what's appropriate also different-world created. *Vibhāṣā* one hundred thirty-two says: "Also wanting to prevent those saying great elements and derived matter are necessarily same-world," manifesting different-worlds exist. Due to these causes and conditions, this treatise is composed. Various existents

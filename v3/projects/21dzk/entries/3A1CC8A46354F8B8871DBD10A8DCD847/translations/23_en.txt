depth. From this it should be understood. Distinguishing the shallow-deep of dharmas through object coarse-subtle truly has its reason.

Regarding the text "the five aggregate phenomena... later ones are subtle": This later clarifies the four levels of ultimate regarding object coarse-subtle. It should be understood by analogy to the previous. "Observing five aggregates like self-inner realization, abandoning explanation and discussing meaning" etc.: The various sages, through non-discriminating wisdom, condition the true-suchness object and internally realize the self-essence. The hundred negations are all cut off, the four propositions are forgotten here. Subject-object are permanently forgotten, mind and speech all cease. This is called internal realization. However, regarding this internal realization, various explanations differ. One says: all fundamental and subsequent [wisdoms] internally realize true-suchness but don't reflect images, because they condition true-suchness through untainted wisdom. One says: fundamental and subsequent wisdom can all transform images but are not direct conditioning. Otherwise the consciousness-only principle wouldn't be established. One says: when direct wisdom directly realizes the self-essence, it conditions without transforming. Like the self-awareness aspect having no separate objective aspect. Subsequent wisdom transforms images and conditions them due to discrimination. If not so, internal object wisdom etc. conditioning true-suchness objects should have no difference between direct essence and subsequent [realization]. Though there are three explanations, the Great Tang Tripiṭaka and Dharmapāla school consider the latter explanation correct. If extensively distinguished, it's like the explanation in Vijñaptimātratā volume nine.

"Vijñaptimātratā treatise... now comparing to ultimate explanation": Below this, texts are cited and attributed to the four levels. Now three texts are cited. This is the first text. It corresponds to the second conventional and second ultimate. It can be known as in the text. "Cause-effect principle neither identical nor separate": Among the four ultimate meanings, the second principle ultimate is the four truths cause-effect principle. Mental factors are effects, mental kings are causes. Dharma

Such cause-effect is neither identical nor separate. "The third conventional analogously likewise" etc.: Though one four truths, the meaning-gates differ. If depending on conventional gate, explained as third. If depending on ultimate gate, explained as second. Now saying "neither identical nor separate" refers only to text explaining by comparing to ultimate. It should be thus.

"Also volume seven says... namely fourth ultimate": This is the next text, corresponding to second conventional and fourth ultimate. "Like previously explained consciousness differential characteristics" etc.: The previously explained three transformation characteristics rely on the second principle conventional among four conventional truths to explain the eight etc. having differential characteristics according to phenomena. [This is] not the fourth ultimate truth among the four levels of ultimate truth. Exhaustively investigating the principle of eight consciousnesses in ultimate truth, discriminating mind and speech are all severed. The previous mental factors' unity-difference in relation to mind explains by contrasting second conventional and second ultimate. Now using second conventional to discuss in relation to fourth ultimate truth.

"Also that volume's explanation... namely fourth ultimate": "Eight consciousness self-essence not definitely one or different" - Commentary volume seven says: "This non-one-different, depending on four ultimate meanings, opposing four conventional, all can be reasonably contemplated." There's no separate attribution to four-level two truths. This text then makes attributions. Contemplate according to the text. "False consciousness nature true consciousness nature" etc.: Taking the meaning and citing, not the actual treatise text.

"Using initial conventional... pervading two four truths": Initial conventional opposing four ultimate is called name-phenomena two truths. Phenomena means real meaning. Also called provisional-real two truths. Second conventional opposing three ultimate is called phenomena-principle two truths. Phenomena means three categories phenomena. Principle means four truths, two emptinesses, and one true. The

third conventional opposing two ultimate is called shallow-deep two truths. Shallow means four truths principle. Deep means two emptinesses and one true. Comparing to four truths, both are called deep. Fourth conventional opposing one ultimate is called explanation-meaning two truths. Explanation means two emptinesses suchness. Meaning means one true dharma-realm. These two truths are all former-former coarse, latter-latter subtle. Therefore saying "investigating one by one, entering from coarse to subtle, relative discourse pervades two four truths."

"Third mutual inclusion... should have five truths": This question's meaning is as follows: The Tathāgata previously explained: "The dharmas I studied are like earth's grass and trees; what I proclaimed is like leaves in hand." Sarvāstivāda's four truths don't completely include dharmas. Namely space and non-selective cessation are not two kinds of cause-effect. Not objects of defiled mind. Now depending on this sūtra, four truths completely include dharmas. If so, space and non-selective [cessation] are heard dharmas. If they enter four truths, this has already been explained. If they don't enter, there should be five truths. Two cessations are not two kinds of cause-effect. Which truth includes them? Explanation: According to Sarvāstivāda, space and non-selective cessation have separate essences, are not cause-effect, therefore not included in four truths. In Mahāyāna there's no separate essence; they're provisionally established upon true-suchness. True-suchness is the real nature of four truths. Therefore included within four truths.

"Buddha praised Kāśyapa... still not called explanation": Below this is Buddha's answer. Though explained, unexplained remainder differs. However dharmas are included within four truths. "Kāśyapa also said" etc.:

【Lower Section】
Kāśyapa asks again. The question's meaning can be known. "Buddha said good son" etc.: Buddha's answer has two parts: first brief, then extensive. This is the brief answer. "Though entering within, still not called explanation": Suffering means its suffering essence doesn't transcend two kinds of birth-death, using the meaning of all contaminated results to explain suffering. All are within it. This means all are within suffering truth. Various differential suffering characteristics not yet explained are more than what's already explained. This means still not called explanation. Collection, cessation, path etc. should also be known thus. The unexplained is much, while the explained is little.

"Why good... wisdom and superior wisdom": Below this is extensive explanation. "Good son... to buddhas and bodhisattvas' wisdom": This distinguishes wisdom differences regarding persons. When wisdom differences compare, two vehicles are called inferior, Mahāyāna called superior. Now comparing to ordinary stages, two vehicles are called middle, bodhisattvas called superior. "Good son knowing aggregate suffering... never explained it": This explains regarding aggregates. Aggregates are five aggregates, meaning accumulation. Generally knowing aggregate suffering is middle wisdom. Knowing immeasurable differential suffering characteristics is superior wisdom. This superior wisdom's known suffering characteristics, I never explained in those sūtras. "Sense-fields, elements, form, sensation, perception, formations, consciousness" etc.: Above explains suffering characteristics regarding five aggregates. Next explains suffering characteristics regarding twelve sense-fields, eighteen elements, and form, sensation etc. Sense-fields means growth meaning, because they're places where mind and mental factors grow. Elements means nature meaning, because within one body there are eighteen kinds of different natures. Therefore these all have general-specific suffering characteristics. Knowing the general is called middle, knowing the specific is called superior. Above all explains suffering truth characteristics. "Together with collection, cessation, path" etc.: Next explains general-specific characteristics regarding the remaining three truths.

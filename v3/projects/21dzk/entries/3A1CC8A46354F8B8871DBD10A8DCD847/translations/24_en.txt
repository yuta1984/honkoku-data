The sūtra text says: "Knowing that the causation of sensation produces the five aggregates is called middle wisdom." This explains the truth of origination. Middle wisdom [knows] through general characteristics. "One person generating attachment is immeasurable and boundless, beyond what śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas can know. Being able to know that all sentient beings generate such attachment is called superior wisdom." This explains the truth of origination. Superior wisdom knows through specific characteristics. The rest is as explained in the sūtra.

"Good son knows... this is called superior wisdom": Below clarifies the meaning of two truths. The text has two parts. First distinguishing wisdom differences regarding two truths, then distinguishing two truths characteristics in response to textual differences. This is the first text. First clarifying conventional truth, then clarifying ultimate truth. Regarding conventional truth, what middle wisdom knows is the meaning already explained in previous sūtras. What superior wisdom knows is the meaning not yet explained in previous sūtras. "All formations are impermanent etc." equals the other three seals: impermanence, no-self, nirvana tranquility. "This is ultimate" refers to the ultimate in previous sūtras, because it resembles middle wisdom. What has been clarified above: knowing through general characteristics is middle wisdom, knowing through discrimination is superior wisdom. This is the meaning of what has been explained and not yet explained in previous sūtras.

"Ancient explanations say... immeasurable and boundless": This is the explanation of Master Yuan and others. It explains the above text "knowing ultimate is immeasurable and boundless, incalculable, not known by two vehicles, this is called superior wisdom." Below, "ancient explanations say etc." all refer to this master. Therefore his chapter says: "Within ultimate truth, the meanings are separately two: first existence, second non-existence. Existence means the eternal sand Buddha-dharmas of tathāgatagarbha nature. Within non-existence are five. First, within the true tathāgatagarbha, eternal sand Buddha-

dharmas are co-essentially causally assembled, with no dharma separately maintaining self-nature. This is called non-existence. Up to the fifth: within this true, there is no false conceptual empty tathāgatagarbha. These five generally regard the tathāgatagarbha essence ultimate, distinguishing according to meaning. All are ultimate truth. What the present sūtra calls 'knowing ultimate is immeasurable and boundless etc.' is the principle of true-suchness. Within tathāgatagarbha, there are immeasurable and boundless eternal sand virtues. Now it refers to that. Therefore it says 'eternal sand myriad virtues immeasurable and boundless.'"

"This above sūtra text... establishing two truths": Below is the chapter master's text, explaining the meaning of the above cited sūtra text. In this above sūtra text, due to Kāśyapa's question about four truths including dharmas, within the World-honored One's answer, it still reveals that two truths wisdom has middle and superior. Knowing through general characteristics is called middle wisdom, knowing through specific characteristics is called superior wisdom. Truth means reality. Reality means the meaning of careful verification. If the world is orderly without error, therefore called careful verification. The principle of existence and non-existence is unmeasurable by ordinary people, only sages can realize it. Now establishing middle and superior wisdom in contrast to ordinary wisdom, depending on these two wisdoms, two truths are established. This clarifies two truths according to persons.

"Speaking truthfully... the sūtra should clarify": This clarifies two truths of persons and dharmas. In principle this must exist. "Dharmas have superior and inferior" reveals dharma two truths. "Wisdom has shallow and deep" reveals person two truths. "Only two realize truth" means only middle and superior wisdom realize the principles of real existence and non-real existence, excluding inferior ordinary wisdom. Therefore saying "only two." "If generally explaining, two vehicles compare to superior and inferior etc.": "Two vehicles" means śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha two vehicles. The wisdom of two vehicles, compared to ordinary beings' wisdom, is called superior; compared to tathāgata wisdom,

is called inferior. There is no middle wisdom. Another explanation: two vehicles means great and small vehicles, not the small two vehicles. If not so, it wouldn't work like the analogy of superior and inferior wisdom power of faculties. "Being included in inferior and superior" means being included in inferior vehicle and superior vehicle.

"Mañjuśrī said... then there are no two truths": Above distinguishes wisdom differences regarding two truths, below distinguishes two truths characteristics according to Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva. Within this are generally two rounds of questions and answers. First conditional questioning, then verification. The first conditional questioning: the sūtra says "World-honored One's explained conventional truth and ultimate truth, what is their meaning?" This is conditional questioning. Previously explaining two kinds of truth meanings, now briefly not mentioning. "Is there conventional truth within ultimate etc." is verification of what was explained. "If there is etc." below is advancing and retreating cross-examination. "Good son, conventional truth is ultimate truth" is Buddha's answer, answering regarding non-difference meaning. This is the profound verification non-difference gate. Also like the Benevolent Kings Sūtra's "illumination and understanding see no duality." "This clarifies two truths non-separation meaning" is text added by the chapter master, not sūtra text. Non-separation meaning is non-difference meaning. "World-honored One, if so then there are no two truths" is Mañjuśrī's repeated challenge, saying if "conventional truth is ultimate," there's only one truth and no two truths.

"Buddha said good son... worldly dharma": Buddha's extensive answer. First generally clarifying the meaning of two truths, then separately revealing two truths characteristics. This is the first text. "Following sentient beings, explaining there are two truths" clarifies that the intention of explaining two truths is for sentient beings. "If following verbal explanation" below clarifies explaining

that there are two in the path of verbal explanation. The Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra says: "Good son, those sages, regarding this matter, because they are free from verbal designations, manifest perfect enlightenment. Regarding such beyond-language dharma-nature, wanting to make others manifest equal perfect enlightenment, provisionally establish names and characteristics, calling it unconditioned." According to this sūtra text, though the understanding of realization wisdom is one, provisionally establishing names and characteristics, following sentient beings, two truths are explained.

"Good son like... revealing two truths differences": The second separately reveals two truths characteristics. The text has eight repetitions, explaining the characteristics of two truths differences. This is the first, clarifying two truths characteristics regarding differences in person's wisdom. Though the known object's essence is only one, the knowing wisdom has different depths. Like one magical appearance seen differently by two people: the magician knows it's non-existent, this analogizes seeing ultimate at one glance. Ordinary fools grasp it as real, this analogizes seeing conventional. By this principle, two truths are explained. "This clarifies that depending on person's wisdom having shallow-deep reveals two truths differences" is the chapter master's text, not sūtra text.

"Good son... ultimate truth": Below there are seven rounds clarifying two kinds of characteristics. This is the first round regarding existence and non-existence of names, thereby explaining two truths. Penetrating existence is conventional, penetrating non-existence is ultimate. Judging these seven rounds of characteristics, ancient and modern explanations differ. Master Yuan says: Though there are eight rounds, briefly divided into two. The first one is according to persons, the latter seven according to dharmas. Therefore from "this five aggregates combination" onwards, the seven rounds all depend on dharmas to distinguish two truths. This connects the four schools: establishing nature, breaking nature, breaking characteristics, and revealing reality schools.

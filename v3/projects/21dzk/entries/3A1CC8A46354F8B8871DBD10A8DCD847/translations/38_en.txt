The tenth explains "diminishing power and benefiting capability transformation." It says: "Diminishing the power of defiled seeds in the fundamental consciousness, benefiting the function of pure seeds within the fundamental consciousness." "Diminishing" means causing harm. That is, it says "harming the seeds." As is clearly known, the two meanings are mutually applicable.

Question: "Being able to cause non-continuation" and "capable of removing and destroying" are both powers of the path. Why not take the "meaning of non-continuation" but only take the "meaning of capable removing and destroying" to establish the name "elimination"? Explaining: The meaning of non-continuation is strong regarding what is treated; the meaning of removing and destroying is superior regarding what treats. Each is established according to what is superior, so the first two explanations each have different intentions.

"From 'Another explanation of elimination' to 'the name of obstacles'": This is the third explanation. It establishes the name "elimination" based on what elimination depends upon. Regarding "nature being true principle, etc.": As in reverse order, one should match the previous three explanations. "Obstacles are what is eliminated" is the first meaning of non-continuation. "Path is the function of elimination" is the second meaning of removing and destroying. "Nature being true principle, principle being the nature of elimination" is the third meaning of non-arising. The text on the three transformations of basis should be understood accordingly. Regarding "if what is extinguished, etc.": The *Abhidharmasamuccaya* fascicle nine entirely lacks this text. However, fascicle eight of that treatise says: "True suchness, noble path, and non-arising of afflictions. Whether extinction-basis, whether capable of extinguishing, whether nature of extinction - these are characteristics of the Truth of Cessation." Explaining: True suchness is the basis of extinction. The noble path is what extinguishes. Non-arising of afflictions is the nature of extinction. The nature of extinction is precisely the meaning of non-continuation of obstacles. As in reverse order, match to the above three explanations. The Truth of Cessation is precisely the meaning of eliminating obstacles. Therefore, the three meanings are used to explain eliminating obstacles. Also, depending on "mind-transformation," "path-transformation," "gross heaviness transformation," and "liberation meaning," explaining these three meanings is as explained in the *Compilation*.

"From 'Second, establishing the essence' to 'taking as essence'": Among the two obstacles, if afflictive obstacles, taking person-self grasping as primary, they take as essence all 128 fundamental afflictions and 22 secondary afflictions. If cognitive obstacles, taking dharma-self grasping as primary, they take as essence all 128 fundamental afflictions and 22 secondary afflictions. Why are the numbers of the two obstacles equal? Afflictions are established depending upon cognitive obstacles. Being what depends and what is depended upon, therefore the numbers are equal. Therefore the *Vijñānavāda* says: "Cognitive obstacles, according to what corresponds, are sometimes many, sometimes few, as explained regarding afflictions." Based on this we understand by analogy. Therefore they are the same as afflictions. Based on these two obstacles, there are again two types. First, what is eliminated by the path of seeing. Second, what is eliminated by the path of cultivation. Among these, each has seeds, manifest [afflictions], habitual tendencies, karmas, results, etc. These various obstacles are taken as the essence of what is eliminated. Extensively as explained in fascicle one of the *Xianyang*.

"From 'Therefore the Abhidharma says' to 'eliminated by the path of seeing'": Now citing six texts to prove that karmas, results, etc. also pertain to what is eliminated. This is the first text. It is text from fascicle four of the *Abhidharmasamuccaya*. "Namely the three evil destinies" below is the chapter master's text. "All defiled views, doubts, etc. arising from discrimination" - this distinguishes from innate delusions. Therefore it says "discrimination." Views apply to both defiled and pure, pure being like the path of seeing. Doubts are also thus. "Pure doubts" means as in the *Nirvana Sutra*: "If regarding Buddha-nature, one who can raise doubts destroys countless existing afflictions." To distinguish from views and doubts belonging to the pure portion, therefore it says "defiled." "Places of views and places of doubts" means these are causal places of correspondence and co-existence with views and doubts, as well as seed causal places. "Place" means the meaning of basis. Taking cause as basis, results can then arise, therefore called "places." Correspondence and co-

existence causes are precisely the omnipresent [mental factors], object-determining [mental factors], and mind-king. Not other mental factors. Another explanation also applies to fundamental [afflictions], secondary [afflictions], and indeterminate [mental factors]. Namely present and seed causes are both called bases of dependence. "And physical and verbal actions, etc. generated by views, etc." applies to the three types of action. Namely meritorious, non-meritorious, and immobile actions. "And all evil destinies, etc." raises the retributions of the three evil paths, taking as equal the retributions of the eighth rebirth in the desire realm, etc. Question: Among various karmas and results, how many are eliminated by intrinsic nature, how many by non-arising, how many are non-eliminable? Explaining: Among non-meritorious karmas, the general and specific karmas of the three evil paths are uniformly eliminated by intrinsic nature. The remaining evil karmas of human and divine [rebirths] have both eliminable and non-eliminable. Among meritorious and immobile karmas, if regarding two-vehicle practitioners, the karmas of eighth existence, women, hermaphrodites, eunuchs, egg-born and moisture-born, northern continent, unconscious heaven, and second births in various upper levels are all eliminated by non-arising. If speaking in terms of retribution, retributions of the three evil paths and eighth rebirth in desire realm, etc. are all eliminated by non-arising. If regarding bodhisattvas' path of seeing, all general and specific evil karmas can also pertain to elimination. Women and eighth rebirth, etc., all wholesome karmas are all non-eliminable. The retributions of eighth existence, etc. are also all non-eliminable. Because they allow experiencing many lives. Question: Why eliminate views and doubts first, then eliminate the rest? Explaining: Because among views, the three views and doubts are only eliminated by seeing. Also, views are capable of discriminating self and what belongs to self, etc., obstructing the principle of no-self. Their function particularly increases, generating others. Or views, by understanding principle, first eliminate various views. Because they are determined by the path of seeing, next removing doubts. The remaining various delusions are all generated by views, therefore eliminated afterward.

Ignorance is difficult and furthermore capable of being a cause of views. Because view-power increases, views come first. These questions and answers are as in the *Abhidharma Commentary*.

"From 'Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra' to 'all are what is eliminated'": These are the next two texts. They prove that karmas and results arising from discrimination are all what is eliminated. "Nirvana without remainder" below is the chapter master's text. *Saṃdhinirmocana* fascicle three entirely lacks this text. Only fascicle four has this text. Therefore that fascicle says: "In the first ground, ignorance that grasps person-self and dharma-self, the defilement of evil path afflictions is comprehensively ignorance." *Yogācārabhūmi* fascicle seventy-eight says: "Namely in the first ground, there are two types of ignorance. First, ignorance that grasps pudgala and dharmas. Second, ignorance of evil destiny defilements, and taking those gross hindrances as what is counteracted," etc. In this present text, it designates the second ignorance. "Evil destiny defilement ignorance" - the word defilement applies to the three paths and destinies. Karmas and results generated by discriminative defilements are all called "destinies" as a term of disparagement. Like explaining half-eunuchs as called "evil destinies of humans." Why are karmas and results also called ignorance? Various karma-results, etc., though their essence is not ignorance, karmas are what ignorance generates, results are what ignorance brings about. Being categories of ignorance, they are also called ignorance. "Namely these evil destiny karmas, results, etc." - the word "etc." equally includes specific retribution karmas and results, etc. arising from discrimination within good destinies. One should say "only evil destinies," but because the inclusion is not exhaustive. "Nirvana without remainder is already conditioned cessation, therefore, etc.": This proves through principle that karmas and results arising from innate delusions are also what is eliminated. This doesn't mean proving what is eliminated by the above first ground. Generally observing this text,

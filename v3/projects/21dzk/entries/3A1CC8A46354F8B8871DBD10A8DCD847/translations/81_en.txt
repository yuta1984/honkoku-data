collectively having nine causes. This is due to adding the conflicting cause. Regarding these three explanations above, it is unclear which teacher [proposed them]. Therefore, one cannot state their names. If there were someone knowledgeable, it would be fortunate to have this recorded.

From "derived matter facing great [elements]" to "for these two reasons": Above explained how many causes great [elements] possess when facing derived matter. Below, the second [section] clarifies how many causes derived matter possesses when facing great [elements]. There are three explanations for this: eight, nine, and ten causes respectively. This is the first explanation. Collectively there are eight causes. Designating cause: sound is derived [matter]. It can still designate great [elements]. Derived sound, facing productive great [elements], becomes a designating cause. Hence saying "because sound and verbal designation elucidate great [elements]." Second, depending cause: producer and produced mutually depend, taking this as this cause. The meaning of dependence extends to both proximate and distant [relations]. Now speaking regarding the distant, derived [matter] facing great [elements] becomes a depending cause. "Among defiled and pure causes, etc.": there are three [types of] ten causes - first, pure ten causes; second, defiled ten causes; third, neutral ten causes. Speaking of pure ten causes: taking unconditioned wholesome sound as the essence of designating cause. Taking the nature of sensation in pure states as the essence of depending cause. Taking possessed seeds as the essence of both arising and pulling causes. Taking the six dependency locations of unconditioned insight, etc. for distant mutual support as the essence of supporting cause. Taking what lacks encompassing seeds and manifestations as the essence of developing cause. Taking unconditioned seeds and their manifestations as the essence of determining-difference cause. Beginning from pure dependence, ending with determining-difference cause, all taking these dharmas as the essence of collaborative cause. Various defiled dharmas serve as conflicting causes for pure dharmas. Unconditioned dharmas that do not mutually obstruct in matters of arising, abiding, accomplishing, and obtaining serve as the essence of non-conflicting cause. Speaking of defiled ten causes: taking unwholesome sound as the nature of designating cause. Having pleasant sensation depending on painful sensation, or having good friends depending on evil companions, having receiver depending on

what is received - this constitutes depending cause. The seven branches of ignorance, etc. are named pulling cause. The three branches of craving, grasping, and existence are named arising cause. Through distant mutual support regarding objects, [this is] named supporting cause. Lower realms pulling upper three qualities in mutual generation - whether seeds or manifestations - serve as developing cause. What can attract results of one's own realm, etc. serves as determining-difference cause. From depending cause beginning through determining-difference cause ending, all together obtaining results is named collaborative cause. Unconditioned dharmas, etc. are conflicting causes for defiled dharmas. In matters of arising, abiding, accomplishing, and obtaining, what does not mutually obstruct is named non-conflicting cause. Neutral ten causes are as previously explained. Now regarding the first two - defiled and pure ten causes - explaining these two causes, hence saying "among defiled and pure causes, etc."

Regarding disciplinary precepts and concentration-accompanied precepts, whether unmoistened or already moistened: this clarifies the two causes of pulling and arising among pure causes. Those various pure dharmas that have not yet been moistened by the power of good friends, etc., regarding later self-results are named pulling cause. After being moistened, [they are] named arising cause. Regarding non-disciplinary precepts, whether unmoistened or already moistened: those various defiled dharmas that have not yet been moistened by the power of craving, evil friends, etc., regarding later self-results are named pulling cause. After being moistened, [they are] named arising cause. Because these two causes exist among derived [matter], they can pull and generate later retributive great [elements]. Therefore, derived [matter] facing great [elements] possesses these two causes.

From "Fifth, supporting cause" to "non-conflicting cause": "Due to being supported by functional dependency location" - within supporting cause there are six dependency locations. The first five dependency locations distantly support and accomplish conditioned dharmas of the three realms. If combined with the sixth dependency, they determine unconditioned dharmas. What assists and accomplishes causation is named support.

Not all conditioned [dharmas] possess the five dependencies. The arising of mind and mental factors all possess the five dependencies. Derived matter facing great [elements] is not mind, etc. Therefore, among the five dependencies, only functional dependency location support exists. Excluding seeds and proximate auxiliary conditions, the remaining distant auxiliary conditions of derived [matter], possessing sufficient functional distant mutually-assisting conditions regarding great [elements], can then pull and generate later retributive great [elements]. Hence saying "due to being supported by functional dependency location." "Due to definitely and separately being able to attract one's own retribution" - generally, determining-difference cause is self-nature correspondence. Namely, wholesome karma definitely pulls human and heavenly eighth consciousness, not evil destinations. Self-nature serves as cause with self. Color within self-nature serves as cause with color. Internal within color serves as cause for internal. Within internal, nourishment serves as cause with nourishment. Differential power of self-nature correspondence is named "determining." Not sharing with others, hence named "different." Derived [matter] regarding great [elements]: color only pulls color great [elements], not sound. Sound only pulls sound great [elements], not color. Thus named "definitely attracting one's own retribution." Hence possessing this cause. Seventh, collaborative cause: among the above causes, excluding designating cause, the remaining five types of causes, regarding arising and other matters, have harmonious power, together accomplishing one activity. Hence named collaborative cause. The reason for excluding designating cause: verbal designation and dharmas do not harmoniously combine, their power being distant, hence not taking [it] as nature. Since the cause is precisely the previous [ones], its result is also thus. Non-conflicting cause: its meaning is easy to understand.

From "excluding developing" to "because not in accordance": this excludes other causes. "Capable of pulling self-type, same-quality, superior-quality, etc." - generally, developing cause: manifest [phenomena] pulling seeds, seeds pulling manifest [phenomena], manifest pulling manifest, seeds pulling seeds - all are this cause. Results facing self-types necessarily have the same nature. Speaking of "self-type

【Lower Section】
same-quality" excludes different types serving as causes - this is only regarding self-nature. Speaking of "superior quality" excludes one's own same-type serving as cause for inferior quality. Derived matter facing great [elements], being already different types, cannot pull same-quality as cause. Producer and produced having equal superiority and inferiority, cannot pull superior quality as cause. *Mahāśāstra* volume 5 says: neutral [dharmas] serve as causes for wholesome and defiled [dharmas] - namely, each one's own seeds in the base consciousness. However, facing manifest activities, their natures are also the same. From this one should understand: causes that pull superior qualities to serve as causes are also developing causes. When the producer is inferior, the produced is also inferior. When the producer is superior, the produced is also superior. Mutually facing [each other] equally, hence cannot pull superior quality as cause. Therefore excluding this cause.

From "or explaining there are nine" to "because there is conflict": these are the latter two explanations. The first interpretation says: collectively there are nine causes. The reason for adding developing cause: among neutral causes, sprouts, stems, fruits, etc. in successive continuity, facing that agriculture, whether maturing or ripening, serve as developing cause. According to this principle, producer and produced mutually develop each other, hence having this cause. "Or becoming ten causes due to having conflict" is the third explanation. A former teacher explaining neutral ten causes said: at the beginning of the kalpa, there were no grain seeds. Subsequently using conventional names, explaining grain seed names serves as designating cause. Due to having grain seed names, having grain and rice results serves as already-existing cause - now called depending cause. Relying on names to seek grain, hence reaching field agriculture serves as planting cause - now called pulling cause. Seeds being able to produce sprouts serves as generating cause - now called arising cause. Moistening and nourishing by water, etc. serves as encompassing cause - now called supporting cause. Sprouts producing stems and leaves serves as growth cause - now

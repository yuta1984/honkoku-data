contradiction.

From "Or Yogācāra says" to "the former explanation is better": This is the second explanation. The first explanation's meaning: only within co-substantial production, the measures of producer and produced are equal. Hence saying "equal measure indestructible." The second explanation's meaning: when *Yogācārabhūmi* volume three says "equal measure indestructible," whether co-substantial production or separated-substantial production, the producers and produced within them all have the meaning of before-after similarity, hence saying "equal measure indestructible." Therefore *Abhidharmasamuccaya* and *Yogācārabhūmi* each conform to each other, all without contradiction. How can [one] know? *Yogācārabhūmi* 54 only says "great [elements] maintain original measure, not causing diminishment," not explaining "great [elements] and produced [matter] having equal measures." Hence knowing: "equal" means before-after similarity. The chapter compiler judges: In explaining *Yogācārabhūmi* volume three's equal measure indestructible meaning, though there are two explanations, the first explanation only relies on co-substantial production to explain equal measure. Taking this as superior, hence saying "the former explanation is better."

From "Nourishing causes are precisely" to "hence named growth causes": In this text, from "nourishing causes" below to "causing increase" is *Abhidharmasamuccaya* treatise text. From "through great [elements'] intimate nourishment" to "hence named growth causes" is the chapter compiler's explanatory text. Saying "nourishing causes are precisely growth causes" also has two interpretations. First, taking growth meaning to briefly explain the name "nourishment." Second, precisely using *Yogācārabhūmi* treatise's nourishing causes to correspond with *Mahāyāna-abhidharmasamuccaya*'s possessed growth causes. Hence saying "nourishing causes are precisely growth causes." Saying "nourishment" concerns nourishing results causing growth, thereby establishing the cause name. Or "growth precisely [as] cause" is a karmadhāraya compound. Because growth belongs to great [elements]. Or "cause of growth" is a tatpuruṣa compound. Because growth belongs to produced [matter].

From "*Yogācārabhūmi* volume three" to "becoming their nourishing cause": In the reconciling contradictions below, first presenting contradictory texts, then from "able to nourish derived matter" below, correctly reconciling contradictory texts. This is precisely the beginning. Regarding nourishment saying: If through great [elements] intimately nourishing derived matter causing increase, great [elements] become nourishing causes, then why does *Yogācārabhūmi* treatise volume three, in explaining growth causes, say "through sleep, etc. as causes, those produced [matters] obtain increase"? If so, then sleep, etc. become causes. What relation [is there] to great elements? How can [one] know that the *Yogācārabhūmi* treatise volume three cited here presents contradictory text? In Master Ji's *Abhidharmasamuccaya* commentary, after explaining growth causes, [he] says "if already so, then how?" and then cites *Yogācārabhūmi* treatise volume three. In this present chapter, though lacking the words "if already so," [it is] abbreviated for textual reasons.

From "Able to nourish derived matter" to "hence no fault": In the reconciling contradictions below, there are precisely three explanations. These are the first two explanations. The first explanation says: Regarding nourishment there are two: first, nourishing causes; second, nourishing conditions. Great [elements] are nourishing causes; sleep, etc.'s four conditions are precisely nourishing conditions. *Abhidharmasamuccaya* concerns causes, hence explaining great elements as growth causes. *Yogācārabhūmi* concerns conditions, hence including sleep, etc. to explain growth causes, also named conditions. Hence no contradiction. Also "through those conditions, etc." is the second explanation. This treatise's meaning: through great elements being nourished by sleep, etc.'s conditions, precisely these great elements, having been nourished by those, then cause derived matter to obtain increase. Hence explaining great elements as able-to-nourish causes. In *Yogācārabhūmi* commentary, [it] only述 this second explanation. Hence commentary volume two says: That *Abhidharmasamuccaya* treatise explains the meaning that only all great elements all nourish derived matter. In this *Yogācārabhūmi* treatise, [it] only explains that growth-nurturing four

great [elements], drawing resources from four conditions, arise and can nourish derived matter. However, derived matter [is such that] great elements intimately nourish [it]; great elements borrow nourishment from four conditions for resources, growing and then nourishing derived matter. Now explaining that external conditions enable great [elements] to nourish; [it is] not [that] external four conditions are these nourishing causes (above is commentary text). Now examining, this explanation still explains nourishing conditions meaning. If so, what difference [is there] with the first explanation? Explaining: The first explanation's meaning: sleep, etc.'s four conditions, in relation to derived matter, become nourishing conditions. The second explanation's meaning: sleep, etc.'s four conditions, in relation to producer great [elements], become nourishing conditions. Hence the two explanations differ. Further examining commentary texts, [one] should exert effort.

From "Or those [causes] universally nourish" to "mind, etc. are not so": This is the third explanation. This explanation's meaning says: nourishing causes have two [types]. First, universal nourishing causes, like sleep, etc.'s four conditions. Second, particular nourishing causes, like great elements nourishing produced [matter], etc. Namely, derived matter's nature is dull, hence borrowing two nourishments - the so-called universal and particular two nourishing causes. Mind and mental factors, etc., [having] nature that is sharp, hence only borrowing universal causes, not depending on particular causes. *Yogācārabhūmi* indicates universal and particular two nourishing causes; *Abhidharmasamuccaya* only concerns particular nourishing causes. Because what is regarded differs, [there is] no contradiction. Regarding making sleep, etc.'s four conditions nourishing conditions, there are altogether three explanations. The first explanation's meaning: only in relation to produced [matter], explaining as nourishing conditions. The second explanation's meaning: only in relation to producers, explaining as nourishing conditions. The third explanation's meaning: universally in relation to great [elements] and produced [matter] and mind, mental factors, etc. - all various dharmas, explaining as nourishing conditions. Therefore the three explanations each have separate meanings.

From "Volume fifty-four's question" to "and maintaining": Below citing two texts to prove great [elements] in relation to derived matter become particular nourishing causes. This is the first text. Some chapter editions saying "sixty-four" are erroneous. "Through those transformations transforming, hence those established and maintained" - Master Ji's *Yogācārabhūmi* commentary says: These three meanings, like configuring them within the below five meanings of arising, depending, establishing, maintaining, and nourishing. Transformation here contains three types: arising causes, depending causes, and nourishing causes. Precisely first arising from great elements becomes arising cause; again following their karma is precisely depending cause. Superior concentration power is one part within nourishing causes. [One] should know: remaining establishment is establishing cause; maintaining is maintaining cause (above is commentary text). Through what causes and conditions do great [elements] and produced [matter] transform? The treatise's next text says: Through three causes and conditions, great elements transform, causing derived matter to transform and turn. First, through sentient being usage; second, through karmic creation; third, through superior concentration. "Sentient being usage" means: through earth great [element] being struck and touched, through vessel differences, through differences causing derived matter to obtain transformation. Or through being moistened by water, heated by fire, dried by wind, etc., causing derived matter to obtain transformation. [One] should know: this is named causing derived matter to transform and arise through those great elements' sentient being usage (above is treatise text). Explaining: "Through vessel differences" here means: through original vessels being different, causing others to transform and arise differently. Like rain reaching the ocean transforms into salty taste; if reaching hell, then becomes fierce flames; if reaching earth, then grows grass and trees; if following oyster and clam mouths, then becomes pearls. All through vessel differences, therefore transforming and arising (etc.). The remainder [follows] the chapter's explanation. In order to reveal these transformation causes, hence saying "through those transformations transforming, etc."

From "*Prakaraṇāryavāca* volume five" to "named great-produced": In proving great elements as particular

only says eliminating coarse and heavy [qualities]. Because the essence [of cognitive obscurations] is not binding dharma. If [it concerns] afflictive obscurations, [it] explains elimination from two [aspects]. As in [*Yogācārabhūmi*] fifty-nine: "From their association and objects, afflictions can be eliminated" etc., extensively explained. The *Prakaraṇāryavāca* states: "What elimination follows from means: from the realm of object-supports, eliminate all afflictions. Having eliminated afflictions in object-support realms, because there are no bindings, all associated dharmas are also eliminated accordingly." This is precisely the same. Master Jing says: "According to Abhidharma treatise explanations, only eliminating objective binding - not binding to previous objects is called eliminating delusions. Because afflictions and mind, throughout the three times, as companion nature constantly follow and cannot be separated, [one] does not eliminate association. Now in Mahāyāna, past and future dharmas do not exist; only present [dharmas] are bound and existent. Through noble path arising, affliction-associated mind-dharmas not arising is called eliminating association. Having eliminated association and no longer conditioning objects is called eliminating objective binding. Also, when previously arousing two bindings, the seeds formed through perfuming are called 'having two bindings'; now when eliminating seeds is called 'eliminating two bindings.'"

"This text depends on elimination... up to complete liberation": This is the chapter master's text. "This text explains depending on eliminating afflictive obscurations" etc. means: Now this text saying "eliminating two types of binding - association and object-support" explains [this] depending on the three vehicles commonly eliminating afflictive obscurations. Eliminating characteristic binding and coarse-heavy binding mostly explains depending on bodhisattvas' simultaneous elimination of two obscurations. Question: What distinctions exist between characteristic and coarse-heavy bindings? Explanation: Master [Kui]ji of Mahāyāna [says]: "All contaminated wholesome, neutral, unwholesome etc. minds all have discriminating characteristic aspects. These characteristics can bind mind. This does not mean characteristic binding is precisely attachment

Coarse-heavy binding refers to all contaminated non-subtle nature, the same as the contaminated coarse-heavy explained in *Yogācārabhūmi* fifty-eight. Question: If characteristics that are not attached also can be called capable binding, then characteristic aspects of subsequent-attainment wisdom should also be capable binding. Explanation: That subsequent-attainment wisdom, having eliminated contamination, then attains conditioning all characteristics, all becoming verified understanding. Contaminated [mind] is not like this, hence can bind perception. Question: If all contaminated dharmas can bind the perceiving aspect, [they] should all be called characteristic binding. If so, when self-verification conditions perception, does [it] also bind self-verification? Explanation: There are two explanations. One says [it] also binds, being contaminated type. One says [it] does not bind, not being the same as perceiving aspect conditioning characteristics. Extensively as explained in *Vijñaptimātra* Commentary volume nine. Also the *Pivotal Essentials* says: "Manas becomes the root of consciousness binding." Now observing this meaning, if objective binding's essence only concerns afflictive obscurations; if characteristic binding's essence concerns dharma-attachment explanations. Hence when this is eliminated, characteristic binding is liberated. If so, should emptiness-of-persons wisdom, being together with dharma-attachment, be called characteristic binding? Because this generally manifests that association and objective binding pervade three-vehicle elimination, while characteristic binding is only bodhisattva elimination. If through dharma-attachment, then two-vehicle emptiness-of-persons observation should also have characteristic binding. Extensively as explained there.

"Question: What sequence... bodily coarse and heavy [qualities]": This is the seventh [question], making inquiry based on [*Yogācārabhūmi*] fifty-nine. Within [this] are two [parts]: first clarifying ordinary beings' sequence of abandoning obstacles, later clarifying noble ones' sequence of abandoning obstacles. This is precisely the first. In the first ordinary beings [section], [it] has [them] indicate four obstacles. First eliminate householder

obstacles, next eliminate renunciant obstacles. Having attained renunciation, next wanting to cultivate concentration, [one] should abandon those concentration obstacles, namely family seeking-thought etc. Next abandon concentration obstacles. Because [one] has not yet attained the six types of attention in preliminary concentration, [one] should temporarily eliminate obstacles to attaining attention - bodily coarse and heavy [qualities] etc. Here saying "family etc. three types of seeking-thought" refers to *Yogācārabhūmi* eighty-nine: "Mind harboring defilement, clinging to country, arousing intentional speech, following and turning accordingly is called country seeking-thought. Mind harboring defilement, clinging to relatives, arousing intentional speech, following and turning accordingly is called family seeking-thought. Mind harboring defilement, clinging to self-benefit, making excuses and delays, hoping to attain later, arousing intentional speech, following and turning accordingly is called immortality seeking-thought."

"Next eliminate path of seeing... should eliminate two obscurations": Above clarified abandoning obstacles that are preliminary to noble path. This next clarifies noble persons' sequence of eliminating obstacles. Namely first eliminate seeing delusions, next eliminate cultivation delusions. When seeing and cultivation delusions are exhausted, [one] eliminates obstacles to uncontaminated concentration's inherent nature. Next eliminate phenomenal obstacles, namely the five sense faculties' non-pliancy nature's obstacles belonging to superior concentration. These concentration obstacles are one portion of cognitive obscurations, hence the treatise below says: "In eight liberations, having eliminated cognitive obscurations, [one] eliminates concentration obstacles. [This concerns] persons seeking Mahāyāna. Next [one] should eliminate all obstacles of cognitive obscuration categories." Hence that text says: "Next there is one individual who should eliminate all obstacles of cognitive obscuration categories." According to this sequence, [one] should eliminate afflictions. Now this text saying "should eliminate two obscurations" also has no contradiction.

"Question: Path of seeing and cultivation... extensive manifestation": This is the eighth question, raising inquiry based on [*Yogācārabhūmi*] fifty-nine. Hence that text says: "Eliminating all afflictions - is [it] sudden or gradual?" If following that treatise, [it] first questions sudden-gradual, next questions sequence. Now following convenience, [it] later questions sudden-gradual. That explanation [says]: "Seeing-eliminated afflictions are suddenly eliminated, not gradually. Why? Because through direct realization wisdom making direct realization of truths, [one] can eliminate afflictions eliminated by path of seeing. However, this direct realization corresponds with truth-embracing attention. Therefore three minds suddenly eliminate all seeing-eliminated afflictions confused about suffering truth etc. Cultivation-eliminated afflictions are eliminated gradually. Because [one] must repeatedly cultivate path to be able to eliminate [them]." These various meanings will be extensively manifested in the path of seeing chapter.

Because they are the six practices, they are included in preparatory wisdom. This refers to obtaining noble fruits, therefore saying "if approaching the ultimate fruit, etc." If ordinary beings do not approach the noble path, rejoicing in higher and being disgusted with lower, arousing the six-practice wisdom and being able to subdue delusions, etc., this is six-practice wisdom, not preparatory wisdom. Only concentration, not scattered, therefore. Only cultivated wisdom, not hearing-contemplating wisdom.

"From 'The two paths that can eliminate' to 'because it is not yet accomplished'": That this path is definitely not contaminated or preparatory wisdom means: if preparatory wisdom does not apply to uncontaminated, initially saying "contaminated" already includes preparatory, so what need is there to additionally mention "preparatory"? If preparatory applies to uncontaminated, there would be no need to raise preparatory wisdom for distinction. Explaining: Among the three wisdoms, preparatory wisdom is also non-discriminative. This contaminated path also has preparatory, uninterrupted, and liberation. Previously saying "contaminated" includes those three paths. Later saying "preparatory" distinguishes between fundamental and subsequent wisdom among the three wisdoms. Therefore it speaks repeatedly. "Contaminated wisdom is previously practiced, etc." - this distinguishes that contaminated minds etc. are not paths capable of elimination. That is, preparatory wisdom of contaminated mind and contaminated subsequent wisdom, due to four causes, are therefore not paths capable of elimination. First, they are previously practiced. Second, they are led by grasping at characteristics. Third, because they cannot yet obliterate and subdue these characteristics, they cannot eliminate delusions. Fourth, or preparatory wisdom is that which can seek the suchness to be realized, seeking the non-discriminating wisdom it leads to, but because it is not yet accomplished, it cannot eliminate delusions. Through non-discriminating wisdom, this is what preparatory leads to, and suchness is what preparatory seeks to realize. Precisely through the non-discriminating wisdom it leads to, being able to realize suchness and accomplish it, therefore it can eliminate

the two obstacles. Not preparatory wisdom. In this present text, it briefly presents three meanings, not raising the second meaning of being led by grasping at characteristics. Grasping at characteristics means the two graspings possessed by the sixth and seventh consciousnesses are characteristics of the perceiver, therefore called grasping at characteristics. Question: If contaminated minds etc., because they carry grasping at characteristics, cannot eliminate delusions, subsequent [wisdom] also has characteristics. How does it eliminate latent tendencies? Explaining: Though subsequent [wisdom] has characteristics, it is not led by grasping. It is not bound by bondage. Contaminated [consciousness] is not thus, therefore cannot eliminate.

"From 'Among uncontaminated wisdom' to 'not subsequent wisdom'": The first master here uses reasoning to establish the doctrine. This master shows that only non-discriminating wisdom can eliminate the latent tendencies of the two obstacles, subsequent [wisdom] cannot. Even if creating non-characteristic observation, because characteristic aspects of objective characteristics still exist, it cannot eliminate. Only non-discriminating wisdom has this eliminating capability. However, in the sutras and treatises, there is no explanation that subsequent [wisdom] can eliminate latent tendencies. It is not that among the seeing and cultivation paths of bodhisattvas, first eliminating cognitive [obstacles] uses non-discriminative, and later eliminating afflictions uses subsequent wisdom. Only fundamental wisdom can eliminate.

"From 'There is an interpretation that subsequent [wisdom]' to 'as established there'": This second master establishes through reasoning. This master's intention shows that though subsequent [wisdom] has no power to eliminate latent tendencies like delusion-regarding-principle, doubts, etc., because it clearly manifests in established and non-established truth characteristics and realizes without error, it can also permanently eliminate delusion-regarding-phenomena latent tendencies. Delusion-regarding-principle latent tendencies have profound and distant behavioral characteristics, requiring realization of that principle before being able to eliminate them. Delusion-regarding-phenomena latent tendencies have shallow and near behavioral characteristics; though [involving] substantial characteristic observation, they can also be eliminated. Extensively citing the Yogācāra as established there refers to the tenth fascicle of *Vijñaptimātratā*. It cites Yogācāra fascicle fifty

saying: "In the cultivation path stage, there are two kinds of paths. The first is non-discriminating wisdom. The second is subsequent wisdom. Subsequent wisdom is called 'worldly-supramundane.' Because contaminated paths are purely mundane. No purely mundane path can permanently harm latent tendencies. Because they are previously practiced. Because they are led by grasping at characteristics. Up to extensive explanation." Since it says "worldly-supramundane paths can also permanently eliminate," therefore we know that eliminating obstacles applies to subsequent wisdom.

"From 'By this reasoning' to 'eliminated by the two wisdoms of the path'": These above texts are all from the tenth [fascicle] of the *Vijñaptimātratā* treatise. This present text again distinguishes the extent of what the two wisdoms eliminate. According to previous explanations, because the approaches of intimate and non-intimate realization of principle differ, various view-eliminated [delusions] and cultivation-eliminated ignorance, the two views of self and extreme, and fundamental and subsidiary delusions regarding principle that are associated with these, are eliminated through non-discriminating [wisdom]. The remaining greed, hatred, pride, ignorance, and subsidiary afflictions associated with these that are delusions regarding phenomena can also be eliminated through subsequent wisdom. Because their behavioral characteristics are shallow and near.

"From 'This is in the two vehicles' to 'eliminated at one time'": That remaining cultivation-eliminated delusions regarding phenomena apply to elimination by two wisdoms - this is in the two vehicles, not the bodhisattva stage. Because bodhisattva cultivation path does not eliminate delusions regarding phenomena latent tendencies. Only cognitive obstacles are eliminated by fundamental wisdom. Among afflictive obstacles, it applies. One wisdom eliminates. However, regarding delusions about principle, self-view etc. are suddenly eliminated only at the time of the ninth-grade path for each ground. While the previous eight grades are already eliminated first. The remaining afflictions can arise subsequent wisdom to eliminate. At the time of the ninth-grade path, non-discriminating wisdom arises to eliminate. Because of delusions regarding principle, this refers to the nine grades separately eliminated by uninterrupted paths. If not emerging from observation, then eliminating the nine grades, only non-discriminating wisdom eliminates delusions regarding phenomena among the eight grades.

Because in one observation path, the first eight cannot be subsequent [wisdom] and the ninth fundamental wisdom. That is, those co-arising with self-views etc. in the sixth consciousness must be eliminated only at the ninth-grade path. Though without grade numbers, it is not like the seventh consciousness eliminated at diamond mind. Question: If self-views etc. co-arising with the sixth [consciousness] are the same as the seventh consciousness, eliminated at diamond mind, what obstruction is there? Explaining: There would be the error that learned noble ones in form and formless realms arise uncontaminated paths and conversely eliminate seeds of self-views etc. of lower grounds. If permitting this, then noble persons should have the obstruction of nourishing birth through manifest [activities]. Since noble persons are already permitted seed-nourishing birth, when first separating from desires of lower grounds, those self-views etc. must all be eliminated completely. It is not the same because the seventh consciousness does not nourish birth. Traditionally, "this is in the two vehicles etc." also applies to bodhisattvas. If only two vehicles, how could one speak of "non-established characteristics"? Because two vehicles do not observe the non-established. Now I say this is not so. Because life-emptiness suchness is also called non-established. Only two vehicles, not the bodhisattva stage. Question: Do delusions regarding principle and phenomena have broad and narrow [distinctions]? Explaining: Ancient explanations say delusions regarding phenomena necessarily involve delusions regarding principle. Delusions regarding principle are not necessarily delusions regarding phenomena, therefore there are broad and narrow [distinctions]. Master Hong says: That two-vehicle subsequent wisdom does not eliminate delusions is because delusions regarding phenomena necessarily involve delusions regarding principle. If two-vehicle subsequent wisdom eliminates delusions, there would be delusions regarding phenomena that do not involve delusions regarding principle. The present chapter master's intention is that even delusions regarding principle like self-view also have those that are delusions regarding phenomena. Like [mistaking] rope for snake, etc. Question: That subsequent wisdom eliminates phenomenal delusions - is it simultaneous subsequent elimination or different-time subsequent elimination? It is traditionally explained that subsequent wisdom simultaneous with the essence, in *Vijñaptimātratā*, conditions phenomena not principle, therefore does not eliminate delusions. Previous and subsequent wisdom additionally conditions the true

[The four paths] extend through three wisdoms. Though eighth ground and above lack preparatory wisdom, they have the other two wisdoms, so there are four paths. Within these two wisdoms, they naturally progress, so there is preparatory [practice]. That eighth ground and above have natural preparatory [practice] is recorded in various teachings. Therefore it says "as in ordinary analysis."

"The fifth depends on contemplation, up to because contemplation is coarse": In the Sarvāstivāda school, when ordinary beings eliminate afflictions, they contemplate through conventional [truth], not through emptiness of persons and phenomena. When noble beings eliminate afflictions, they only create person-emptiness, not dharma-emptiness. Therefore the *Saṃyuktahṛdaya* says: "Emptiness through departing from persons." If following the *Tattvasiddhi*, when noble beings eliminate afflictions, they generally create contemplation of both person- and dharma-emptiness. Person-emptiness is understandable. Speaking of "dharma-emptiness" means analytical person-emptiness. In Mahāyāna, through two-emptiness contemplation, they eliminate two obstacles, as the text itself explains. Now saying "person-emptiness contemplation only eliminates afflictions; karmic results do not eliminate habitual tendencies" explains according to the two vehicles' person-emptiness. If bodhisattvas alone create person-emptiness contemplation, it also extends to consciousness-only. Therefore they also eliminate habitual tendencies.

"Yet saying liberation, up to therefore saying not eliminated": Regarding eliminating latent tendencies, among two explanations, the second master says: "The coarse can be removed, etc." This master's meaning reveals: The two vehicles' three minds only eliminate person-attachment. The first mind removes self separate from aggregates, the second mind removes self identical with aggregates, the third mind abandons latent tendencies. Therefore they constitute three minds. Since the third mind abandons two latent tendencies, it says "the coarse can be removed." Therefore "entering second meditation is called eliminating suffering-root latent tendencies" - *Yogācāra* fascicle eleven explains that the second concentration eliminates suffering-root. Though suffering-root seeds are already eliminated in first concentration, now eliminating those suffering-

root latent tendencies, it explains "second meditation eliminates that suffering-root," so it says "entering second meditation is called eliminating suffering-root latent tendencies."
Question: If eliminating latent tendencies, does one separately attain unconditioned [dharmas]?
Answer: *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra* fascicle 360 explains. Subhuti asks: "If unconditioned dharmas have no distinctions, why does the Buddha explain 'habitual tendency continuations are permanently absent in the Tathāgata, yet still exist in the two vehicles'?" The World-Honored One answers: "Habitual tendency continuations are actually not afflictions. In two-vehicle bodies, they cannot induce meaninglessness. In bodhisattvas' bodies, they can induce meaninglessness. The Tathāgata permanently lacks them." This precisely reveals that eliminating habitual tendencies does not attain unconditioned [dharmas]. Otherwise unconditioned [dharmas] would have distinctions. Extensively as explained in *Vijñapti-mātra* commentary fascicle ten.

"Dharma-emptiness contemplation exists, up to accordingly permanently eliminated": Speaking of "three times" - dividing the ten grounds broadly into three stages: initial, middle, and final. Initial means seeing path, middle means cultivation path, final means vajra[-like concentration]. These three stages each arouse dharma-emptiness, so it says "at initial dharma-contemplation of three times, both can permanently eliminate conceptual two obstacles, and karma, results, and habitual tendencies." At later dharma-contemplation times, both can permanently eliminate innate two obstacles, and karma, results, and habitual tendencies. "Evil destinies and human-divine [realms] are accordingly permanently eliminated" - evil destiny karmic results are permanently eliminated at first ground. Human-divine karmic results: if entering first ground and receiving transformation[-body], they are eliminated at first ground. If reaching eighth ground and receiving transformation[-body], they are eliminated at eighth ground. Therefore it says "accordingly permanently eliminated." Another explanation: evil destiny karmic results are eliminated at initial dharma-contemplation; human-divine karmic results are eliminated at middle dharma-contemplation. Therefore called "according to circumstances." If following Hīnayāna, it is as explained in *Abhidharmakośa*.

"Middle dharma-emptiness contemplation, up to therefore both eliminate": Middle dharma-emptiness contemplation means cultivation path stage. In this stage, only cognitive obstruction manifestations and seeds, and two-obstacle habitual tendencies are eliminated. Like cognitive obstacles' coarse and subtle categories, depending on their latent tendencies, they are also accordingly eliminated. Since two obstacles' habitual tendencies mutually perfume each other, when eliminating cognitive [obstacles], afflictive habitual tendencies are also accordingly eliminated. When eliminating afflictions, cognitive habitual tendencies are also accordingly eliminated. Therefore it says "according to cognitive obstacles' coarse and subtle categories, all can be eliminated." "The ten grounds' cultivation path dharma-emptiness contemplation is subtle but necessarily includes person-emptiness, etc." - within the ten grounds, when dharma-emptiness arises, it necessarily includes persons. Therefore it both eliminates two latent tendencies. Only dharma-emptiness wisdom also illuminating person-emptiness is called "including person-emptiness." The profound necessarily includes the shallow, so within dharma-emptiness, provisionally establishing that name, it says "dharma-emptiness includes persons."

Question: If when arousing dharma-contemplation it necessarily includes persons, then when eliminating dharma-attachment it should necessarily also eliminate person-attachment.
Answer: Seeing principles and eliminating afflictions have different meanings. Seeing principles is only through understanding. When understanding is profound, it necessarily reaches the shallow. Eliminating afflictions is through intention. Eliminating the subtle is not necessarily [eliminating] the coarse.

Question: Eliminating afflictions is through intention. Though understanding arises, afflictions are not eliminated. Also through intention, though understanding does not arise, afflictions should be eliminated.
Answer: There is no such doctrine.

Question: If so, though understanding arises afflictions are not eliminated, this doctrine should also not exist.
Answer: Due to compassionate vow support, there can be understanding arising without elimination. If understanding completely does not arise, who would support to attain elimination? Only through emptiness intention, saying "I eliminate afflictions." For afflictions to be eliminated without this principle is impossible.

"The three wisdoms, up to being in learning-reflection stages": In Sarvāstivāda school, among the three wisdoms, whether ordinary or noble, only cultivation wisdom eliminates seeing and cultivation afflictions. Learning and reflection are scattered and cannot eliminate afflictions. In Tattvasiddhi school, the three wisdoms of learning etc. all eliminate afflictions. Therefore that treatise [says]: "Provisional-name mind is eliminated either through extensive learning wisdom's conditions or through contemplative wisdom's conditions. Real-dharma mind, being in warmth etc., is eliminated through emptiness wisdom." In Mahāyāna school, suppression extends through three wisdoms; elimination is only cultivation wisdom, as the text itself explains. "Momentum-force suppression extends through learning and reflection, etc." - there are two types of suppression: first, momentum-force suppression; second, preparatory suppression. Though learning and reflection are scattered, being wholesome wisdom, unwholesome afflictions naturally do not arise from them. Therefore called "momentum-force suppression." Since they abide in scattered mind, it says "not correct contemplation suppression." If suppressing through correct contemplation, one must dwell in concentration, suppressing through four paths. This exists only in cultivation. However, in the desire realm, through meditation etc. collecting the mind, afflictions are also suppressed. That is only learning-reflection, not cultivation wisdom. Therefore this is not eliminating afflictions through cultivation in the desire realm.

"If capable elimination eliminates, up to not being desire realm": "The *Mahāyāna-saṃgraha* explains as transcendental calm-abiding and insight wisdom" - this cites text proving elimination is only cultivation wisdom. The old *Mahāyāna-saṃgraha* says: "Śamatha-vipaśyanā wisdom takes total dharmas as object, moment by moment capable of destroying affliction collections." "*Daśabhūmika* says eighth ground bodhisattvas all can contemplate and retain, etc." - this *Daśabhūmika* text is from dharma-cloud ground. It explains three wisdoms according to specific meanings. Therefore that text says: "Dharma-cloud bodhisattvas, at countless Buddha-places in ten directions, illuminate great dharma, shine great dharma-rain, in one moment, all

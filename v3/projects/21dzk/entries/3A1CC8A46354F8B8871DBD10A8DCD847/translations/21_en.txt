We understand that consciousness etc. arose from past formations and ignorance. One should not again observe consciousness and the other five links, questioning how they exist. By observing up to consciousness, not further observing formations and ignorance links is called "retreating back."

Also, according to the meaning of Asvabhāva's treatise, in reverse observation one observes that aging-death exists through birth, up to name-form existing through consciousness. Consciousness also exists through that name-form. Since consciousness and name-form mutually serve as supports, when making this observation, upon reaching consciousness, one doesn't observe consciousness link existing through formations, but instead observes it existing through name-form. This is called "retreating back." Therefore, when that sūtra says "uniformly retreating back to consciousness," this means taking ālaya-vijñāna's own essence as support, continuously transforming. The essence itself is the name-form link. Though consciousness conditions formations, saying it now depends on name-form refers to consciousness's present conditioning - observing only name-form, thus not manifesting formations.

Regarding the text "first worldly... one true dharma-realm": Defiled and pure forward-reverse observation etc. are as already explained previously. Seventy-seven wisdoms means: conditioning present aging-death produces two wisdoms. First, conditioning present birth produces aging-death. Second, not conditioning present birth cannot produce aging-death, because present self creates itself. Conditioning past aging-death produces two wisdoms. First, conditioning past birth produces aging-death. Second, not conditioning past birth cannot produce aging-death. Observing beginningless aging-death in the past, none fail to take birth as condition. Conditioning future aging-death produces two wisdoms. First, conditioning future birth produces aging-death. [Editorial note: likely missing eleven characters after "death": "Second, not conditioning future birth cannot produce birth-death"] Though future hasn't yet arisen, it may have meaning of abandoning defilements and cessation. Now observing abandoning defilements produces two wisdoms. Among these three periods, the first wisdom

observes effects having causes, revealing their origins. The latter wisdom observes that effects having causes are not indeterminate, refuting heretical false theories of unequal causes or causeless arising. These first six wisdoms are called "true wisdom." The seventh, dharma-abiding wisdom, observes dharmas not included in the links. It's explained as having the meaning of contaminated insight's complete understanding. Complete understanding of three-period dependent origination teachings is called "not included in links." By inference, sage bodies also have dharma-abiding wisdom. In ordinary being bodies there's also true wisdom observation, observing links to generate seven wisdoms. Beginning with aging-death, ending with formation link, in each link all generate seven wisdoms. Therefore total seventy-seven wisdoms exist. Only excluding ignorance, because the wisdom-seed is lacking. Forty-four wisdoms means observing aging-death link as four: first, aging-death suffering; second, aging-death arising; third, aging-death cessation; fourth, practices leading to aging-death cessation. Up to formation link, all make this observation. Ignorance has no cause and wisdom-seed is lacking, so it's not observed. These forty-four wisdoms, seventy-seven wisdoms etc. are extensively as explained in Yogācāra treatise volume ten.

Regarding the text "already with śrāvakas... other śrāvaka objects": "What's realized and attained is one" means the established person-emptiness true-suchness and non-established person-emptiness selflessness one true dharma-realm are what these two-vehicle people equally realize and attain, hence saying "not different from śrāvakas." Aggregates and other dharmas, four noble truth principles are also pratyekabuddha objects. To reveal this meaning, the previous text says "pratyekabuddhas mostly condition this as objects." Therefore not only observing dependent origination, but also combining observation of three categories and four truths, hence explained as "mostly." Flow-turn and return-cessation: manifest defiled dharmas are called "flow-turn." Seed teacher dharmas are called "according to flow-turn." Or all contaminated dharmas are called "flow-turn." Therefore Abhidharmasamuccaya treatise volume four says: "What is flow-turn? All birth-death." Saying "return-

cessation": Yogācāra fifty-one says "return is path truth, cessation is cessation truth." That is, from seed to manifest, path can realize cessation. Uncontaminated seeds in form-body are called "according to return-cessation dharmas."

Except for those with great sharp faculties, not questioning rhinoceros-horn solitary practices. Generally compared to śrāvakas, all are called "great sharp faculties."

Regarding the text "bodhisattva vehicle two... obstructs own results": "Realization and grasping also differ" - Question: Realization has shallow and deep levels, with three vehicles each differing - this principle is acceptable. Grasping has no shallow-deep, with three vehicles equally arising it. Why uniquely call it "different"? Explanation: Though person-grasping is the same, dharma-grasping differs. What does this meaning entail? Dharma-grasping has two types: first, obstructing results; second, not obstructing results. Two vehicles' dharma-grasping doesn't obstruct their own results. Bodhisattvas' dharma-grasping obstructs their own vehicle's results. Though grasping essence is the same, their functions each differ. Therefore saying "grasping also differs."

Regarding the text "second principled... eliminate self-dharma grasping": "The established sixteen skillful means" are the ten skillful means plus six skillful means. "First aggregates, second realms etc." - saying "skillful means" refers to dharma skillful means, all being dependent-head explanations. "Bodhisattvas condition these ten kinds as objects to eliminate self-dharma grasping" means explaining ten skillful means to treat ten selves. Namely, various heretics consider form and other aggregates as one, permanent, etc. Now explaining accumulation with many dharmas and impermanent nature, teaching five aggregates to eliminate that grasping. Next, grasping realms as self able to be causes. Now revealing seed-causes, explaining realm skillful means. Next, grasping bases as self able to create various dharmas. Now revealing all dharmas arise from conditions, explaining dependent origination. Next, grasping aggregates etc. as self having autonomous power to make dharmas thus or not thus. Now revealing self has no autonomous function - only through evil actions receiving unloved results, also

through good karma accommodating loved results, therefore explaining proper-improper places. Next, grasping faculties as self having able-grasping superior powerful functions. Now revealing various faculties have able-grasping functions not due to self, therefore explaining faculties. Next, grasping immediate aggregates etc. as self being permanent. Now revealing conditioned three-period flow-turn, thus knowing aggregate-self isn't permanent, therefore explaining time. Next, grasping self as one being support of defiled and pure two different dharmas. Now revealing four truths as defiled-pure cause-effect, not due to self, therefore explaining truths. Next, grasping self as meditation practice master. Now revealing three vehicles' correct wisdom as able-observers, therefore explaining self. Next, grasping self as able-turning, able-understanding master. Now revealing conditioned essence as contamination-bondage without separate masters, unconditioned as tranquil, free from contamination-bondage without separate masters, therefore explaining conditioned-unconditioned skillful means. Bodhisattvas observe these ten types of skillful means as objects, eliminating self-dharma grasping.

Regarding the text "Yogācāra treatise explains... further adding truths": Yogācāra fifty-seven explains six skillful means - the previous ten from aggregates to faculties. Prakaraṇārtha fourteen explains seven skillful means, further adding truths. Therefore that verse says: "One should know skillful means regarding various aggregates, realms, bases, and multitudinous dependent origination dharmas, proper-improper places, faculties, and truths." Now pointing to that text, hence saying "or explains." Yogācāra twenty-seven explains there are five skillful means: aggregates, realms, bases, dependent origination, and proper-improper places. Vibhāṣā sixth explains four skillful means: realms, bases, dependent origination, and proper-improper place dharmas. All as explained there.

Regarding the text "third realization... two emptinesses thus": "Three natures, three non-natures, consciousness-only subtle principle" means three

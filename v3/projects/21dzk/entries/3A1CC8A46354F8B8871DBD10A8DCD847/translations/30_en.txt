Since this explains wheel function, there is no contradiction. "Prepare the remaining conventional [truths] - all can be comprehensively formed" means not only forming aggregates, etc. Namely, even forming the Four Noble Truths and two emptinesses, all are called conventional.

"Those aggregates, elements, and sense-fields... up to the second ultimate meaning": "Namely, this is the second conventional [truth], etc. in the treatise" refers specifically to Yogācāra fascicle 64 and Xianzang fascicle 6. However, the Vijñāpti-mātra treatise only explains the four truths, not the four conventional [truths]. The remaining text can be interpreted.

"In the fourth round... this is ultimate meaning": The meaning of this text reveals that self, sentient beings, etc. completely lack essence and function, while the five types of worldly dharmas, though lacking real essence, also have function. Though self, etc. and the five dharmas have the distinction of having function versus lacking function, both lack real essence. Now, since the meaning of lacking essence is the same, both are conventional. Saying "armies, forests, etc." means armies and forests are separate - armies are not forests. People gathering form armies; trees gathering form forests. If distinguished by people, there are no armies outside people. If distinguished by trees, there are no forests outside trees. Therefore armies and forests both lack real essence. Jars and clothing are also thus, being formed from the four elements.

"Among the four ultimate meanings... no further different meanings": "Perhaps among the three categories there truly are no such five, etc." - if among the three categories there were five worldly dharmas, then forming the Four Noble Truths should be called worldly ultimate meaning. Since among the three categories there truly are no such five, only the initial conventional [truth] does not connect to the four truths. In the previous third round, self, sentient beings, etc. and aggregates, elements, sense-fields were formed against the Four Noble Truths principle - aggregates, etc. were called conventional, the Four Noble Truths were called true. Now the fourth type calls the five types of worldly dharmas conventional, and knowing these lack reality

is called ultimate meaning. Therefore we know this fourth round seems not to follow proper sequence, but the sūtra's intention in explaining this round is to resolve people's doubts. This can be understood from the text. The first two designators are name-world and sentence-world. The next two designated are bondage-world and dharma-world. The latter one's characteristics are namely attachment-world. Saying "characteristics" means marking behavioral characteristics to distinguish śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas. Just as the four gāthā verses are translated as "characteristics." "All conditioned phenomena are impermanent" are characteristics of the conditioned. Up to "nirvāṇa is quiescent" are characteristics of the unconditioned.

"In the fifth round... the two selflessnesses": This pair reveals calling the two selflessnesses conventional, etc. In the fifth round the sūtra says: "Furthermore, good son, if burning, cutting, etc. are called conventional truth; lacking burning, cutting, etc. is called ultimate meaning." The explanation says: Though the dharmas of burning, cutting, etc. are aggregates, etc., now taking the two selflessnesses upon the aggregates is called conventional. The reason for this is that non-Buddhists and ordinary beings, grasping aggregates and other dharmas as real self and dharmas, are told by the Buddha to be selfless. Therefore the two selflessnesses, in opposition to the one true suchness, are called conventional.

"Later rounds use this... ultimate meaning of ultimate meaning": The general meaning of this text is that the two selflessness dharmas, since their comparative relationships are not singular, are sometimes included in conventional, sometimes in ultimate meaning. The reason for this is: in the later sixth round, using this selflessness to form against the Four Noble Truths principle and explain it as ultimate truth, it belongs to the third attainment ultimate meaning. But now in the fifth round, using this selflessness in opposition to the one true suchness and explaining it as conventional belongs to the fourth ultimate meaning conventional category. Though two-emptiness suchness lacks burning and cutting, depending on burning and cutting's designation,

it is only then revealed, therefore from its designating aspect, it is called burning and cutting. One true suchness cannot be burned or cut and doesn't depend on designation, therefore it belongs to the fourth truth category. From this we should know this fifth round should be placed in the sixth. That sixth round reveals the third conventional, therefore.

"In the sixth round... sequence is unfixed": In the sixth round the sūtra says: "Having the characteristics of eight sufferings is called conventional truth; lacking the characteristics of eight sufferings is called ultimate meaning." The explanation says: "Having the characteristics of eight sufferings" is namely the truth of suffering principle. "Lacking the characteristics of eight sufferings" is namely the two selflessnesses. In the previous third round, using the Four Noble Truths principle against aggregates and other dharmas, aggregates, etc. were called conventional, the Four Noble Truths were called true. Now the sixth round uses these Four Noble Truths against the two selflessnesses, which then become conventional - belonging to the third attainment conventional category. The two selflessnesses, etc. then become ultimate meaning - belonging to the third truth category. "This round should be placed in the fifth round for explanation, etc." - generally the sequence of seven rounds proceeds from shallow to deep in explaining the characteristics of two truths. The previous fifth round marks the fourth conventional and fourth true. This sixth round manifests the third conventional and third true. The earlier is deep, the later shallow. The sequence is confused. Now following verbal convenience, the sequence is unfixed. The remaining text can be interpreted.

"In the seventh round... no further separate approaches": In the seventh round the sūtra says: "Furthermore, good son, like one person having many abilities... up to: depending on father and mother's combination for birth is called conventional truth; those born from twelve-link dependent origination's combination are called ultimate truth." The explanation says: Regarding birth through father and mother versus birth through dependent origination, the two truths are thereby divided. First are personal two truths,

【Lower Section】
second are dharma two truths. People only knowing birth through father and mother is called conventional. Transcendent people knowing dependent origination birth is called ultimate meaning. This follows people's understanding to divide the two truths, also called the two truths of delusion and enlightenment. "Birth through father and mother - the provisionally designated phenomena are coarse and shallow, called conventional, etc." clarifies dharma two truths, also called dharma truths. Now this seventh round generally clarifies only the dharma analogies of two truths distinctions, with no further separate approaches.

"Carefully observing the sūtra's meaning... should also be appropriate": "No difference from the treatises" refers to Yogācāra, Xianzang, Vijñāpti-mātra treatise, etc. "Receiving Buddha's words to accomplish principle" means what the four levels explained in Yogācāra and other treatises are all for interpreting and accomplishing the seven rounds of two truths explained in Buddha's sūtras. When bodhisattvas compose treatises, it's to interpret sūtras. How could they again make themselves contradictory, etc. - this is Master Ji expressing his own feelings. When two armies face each other with spears and shields to avoid harm, they necessarily repel enemies. The current chapter master's intention is only to harmonize with sūtras, not to defeat others and reveal personal views. This clarifies my aspiration. The pronunciation of "mao" (spear) is mo-hou-fan. Shuowen says "spears are two zhang long, erected on military vehicles." Correctly written with the spear character. Some texts write "mou," but Shuowen says "mou is cattle sound." Guangya says "excessive, loving." Mou is not the proper character form. The pronunciation of "shuo" (lance) is shan-bei-fan. Picang says "sheaths are one zhang eight chi long." Shuo and mao together with mao all form contradictions. This accords with textual meaning. Dun (shield) is pronounced shi-zhun-fan. Holding boards for self-protection. Defending against and repelling enemies. Gou is pronounced gong-ju-fan. Maoshi says "people's words being gou are also yun (trustworthy) and xin (faithful)." The Poetry says "gou means sincere." Zhan says "gou means moreover." Mai Kui said "gou means steal." Jin is pronounced ju-yin-fan. Guo Pu said:

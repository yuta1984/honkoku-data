The commentary says: "Equal phenomena" - the old chapter calls it "Sambudhriti," translated as "equal gathering." Also called "equal accumulated gathering." Generally, things that exist when gathered and are absent when scattered are called "equal gathering." For example, when analyzing a pot into form, smell, taste, and touch, one abandons the name "pot." Also, if one abandons form, smell, taste, and touch, there is no separate pot name. Therefore it is called "equal phenomena." "When analyzing without anything to abandon, this is ultimate meaning" - like calling the five flourishing aggregates the truth of suffering. Even when analyzing the five, one does not abandon the name "suffering." Because form is suffering. The same applies up to consciousness. Details follow that explanation.

"Third, principle-phenomenon division... as ultimate meaning": This third round depends on Vibhāṣā text. The phenomenal distinctions of aggregates, elements, and entrances are explained as conventional truth, and the principle of the general characteristics of the sixteen noble practices as ultimate truth. This corresponds to the fourth master's doctrine in Vibhāṣā. This is the evaluators' explanation. Therefore that text says: "The Four Noble Truths all have conventional and ultimate. The phenomena of the Four Truths are called conventional; the principles of the Four Truths are called ultimate. Up to: conventional and ultimate both encompass the eighteen elements, twelve bases, and five aggregates. Space and non-analytical cessation are also encompassed by the two truths." The explanation says: The phenomena of the truth of suffering are things like men, women, pots, and clothes. The principle of the truth of suffering is the principle of suffering, impermanence, emptiness, and non-self. Up to: the phenomena of the truth of the path means the Buddha explaining the path like a boat or raft, up to like flowers and water - these are phenomena. The principle of the truth of the path is the principle of path, suchness, practice, and emergence. Details follow that treatise's explanation in section seventy-seven.

"Fourth, bondage-liberation division... cessation and path first": This fourth round depends on Vibhāṣā text. Suffering and origination are dharmas of bondage, explained as conventional truth. Cessation and path are dharmas of liberation, called ultimate truth. This is

the first master's doctrine in Vibhāṣā, therefore that text says: "Among the Four Truths, the first two truths are conventional truth. The walking and dwelling of men and women, and the various conventional phenomena of pots, clothes, etc. that are seen in the world all enter within the two truths of suffering and origination. The latter two truths are ultimate. All transcendent real merits enter within the two truths of cessation and path."

"Fifth, inferior-superior division... explained as first": This fifth round depends on Vibhāṣā text. Speaking of "inferior-superior discrimination" - Master Yuan's chapter calls it "conditioned-unconditioned discrimination." The master's commentary calls it "inferior-superior discrimination doctrine" - all are the same. The three truths of suffering, origination, and path, being conditioned, are judged as conventional truth. The unconditioned quiescent superior dharma of the truth of cessation is explained as ultimate truth. This corresponds to the second master's doctrine in Vibhāṣā. Therefore that text says: "Among the Four Truths, the first three truths are conventional truth. That there are conventional phenomena in the truths of suffering and origination follows the previous explanation. The Buddha explains the truth of cessation as like a city, like a palace, or like the other shore. All such conventional establishments exist within the truth of cessation. Therefore the truth of cessation is also called conventional. Only the one truth of the path is ultimate truth. Because there are no conventional establishments within it."

"Sixth, emptiness-existence discrimination... explained as first": This sixth round depends on Vibhāṣā text. Among the sixteen practices, emptiness and non-self are superior within principles, therefore explained as ultimate truth. The rest are called conventional truth. This corresponds to the third master's doctrine in Vibhāṣā, therefore that text says: "The Four Truths are all encompassed by conventional truth. That there are conventional phenomena in the first three truths follows the previous explanation. The truth of the path also has various conventional

phenomena. Because the Buddha explains the truth of the path using the names of śramaṇas and brahmins. Only the principle of all dharmas' emptiness and non-self is ultimate truth. Because within emptiness and non-self, various conventional phenomena are not established." Details follow that explanation.

"Seventh, practice-teaching division... called ultimate meaning": This seventh round depends on Saṃyuktahṛdaya text. Therefore Saṃyuktahṛdaya treatise volume ten says: "Question: What is true dharma? Answer: Sūtra, vinaya, and abhidharma are called conventional true dharma. The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are explained as ultimate meaning." That treatise's explanation says: "Sūtra, vinaya, and abhidharma are called conventional true dharma" - the sūtra collection, vinaya, and abhidharma are the true dharma of verbal expression. Because they arise depending on name-bases. The Buddha's words previously explained are the self-nature of speech. Speech operates through dependence. Because it operates through other places, it is called conventional, therefore revealing ultimate meaning is called true dharma. Because names reveal meanings. "The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment explain the ultimate" - the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are ultimate meaning. True dharma arises apart from names. Though contaminated cultivated wisdom operates apart from names, because it has defilements it is not called ultimate meaning true dharma. Master Huizan says: Regarding this verse, the upper half is conventional true dharma. The Āgama sūtras depend on others, therefore conventional. The lower half is true dharma. The so-called factors of enlightenment are the causes and effects of the three vehicles and are uncontaminated, therefore true. Details follow that commentary's explanation in volume ten. Master Yuan says: Within the initial school, having these seven types. Though having seven types, the two truths of phenomena and principle are precisely what the school returns to. And this corresponds to Vibhāṣā evaluators' doctrine.

Question: Vibhāṣā seventy-seven says: "Venerable Vasumitra makes this explanation: Revealing names are conventional. Revealed dharmas are

ultimate. The Great Virtue explains: Proclaiming sentient beings, pots, clothes and other phenomena - verbal expressions arising from non-false, non-deceptive mind are conventional truth. Proclaiming conditional nature, dependent origination and other principles - verbal expressions arising from non-deceptive mind are ultimate truth. Venerable Dharmatrāta explains: The self-nature of names is conventional. The self-nature of meanings is ultimate." Among these three doctrines, which round encompasses them within these seven rounds?

Explanation: The doctrines of masters Vasumitra and Dharmatrāta are encompassed by the seventh round. Because they make the expresser conventional and the expressed ultimate. The Great Virtue's doctrine is encompassed by the second round. Because it makes provisional dharmas conventional and real dharmas ultimate. Another explanation: The Great Virtue's doctrine is encompassed by one portion of teaching within the seventh round. Because it explains two truths only regarding teaching. Since it says "verbal expressions arising from non-deceptive mind," we know it is encompassed by teaching.

"Now this merely manifests... called ultimate meaning": Above, based on nature-establishment, the seven rounds were clarified. Below, the two truths of the four schools are marked out. They correspond to the two truths explained in Nirvāṇa. This initially marks the doctrine of the nature-establishment school, matching it with the sūtra's two truths. Though there are seven rounds, this Nirvāṇa Sūtra text merely manifests the first three approaches. The remaining four round approaches are abbreviated and not explained. This marks the first round, corresponding to the first in the sūtra text. "First dividing into two regarding emotion-reason" marks the first round. Saying "divide into two" means conventional and ultimate. "The combination of five aggregates etc." corresponds to the sūtra text. This is the previously quoted Nirvāṇa thirteenth saying: "Good son, calling the combination of five aggregates 'so-and-so.' Ordinary sentient beings follow what they call. This is called conventional truth. Understanding that there is no name 'so-and-so' in the aggregates, and apart from aggregates

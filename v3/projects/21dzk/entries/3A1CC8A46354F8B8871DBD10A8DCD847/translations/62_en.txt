Namely, the four fundamental [dhyānas], initial not-yet-attained, and intermediate meditation. The four grounds of the formless [realm] are the sphere of infinite space, etc. These ten grounds are precisely the support for contaminant-free [wisdom] of the cultivation path, hence all can subdue. The contaminant-free [wisdom] of the summit of existence cannot eliminate delusions, but through momentum-force, it also can subdue delusions. Saying "both preparatory and fundamental can subdue" means preparatory refers to initial not-yet-attained, fundamental refers to the four meditations and four formless concentrations. The upper not-yet-attained only has the aspects of joy and weariness, still being limited, hence cannot serve as support for the contaminant-free. If [we consider] the support for arising the six practices, [it] also pervades seven not-yet-attained [states]. Now discussing the support-grounds for the contaminant-free, hence only ten grounds. "Six practices are only preparatory" means the eight not-yet-attained [states] are all called preparatory. Among the seven applications of mind, the first six are preparatory, the seventh is fundamental. If using the contaminant-free to subdue these, in the form realm there are six grounds. [These are] not the remaining three preparatory [states] of the form realm, because [they] are not the support for arising the contaminant-free. In the formless [realm], the four grounds all have the contaminant-free, hence can subdue them. The contaminant-free of the summit of existence, though being dark and dull, through momentum-force, also can subdue them. The *Compendium* says: "Within affliction-obstacles, subduing pervades nine grounds, namely form realm six grounds and formless [realm] four grounds." This explanation is difficult to understand. Speaking of "nine grounds," what grounds are these? If [they are] form realm six grounds and formless four grounds, then these are ten grounds. Why only call [them] nine? If [they are] desire realm ground, etc. nine grounds, the desire realm only depends on scattering - how could [it] subdue delusions? This meaning is difficult to understand. Scholars should reflect.

"If truly eliminating... not the path for eliminating delusions": Below clarifies elimination distinctions. Above finished clarifying subduing. Regarding those who truly eliminate, within affliction-obstacles, when eliminating discriminatively-arisen [delusions], the two vehicles only depend on five grounds of the form realm.

Because [it] explains that three direct realizations depend on five supports. Namely, the four fundamental concentrations in the form realm and initial not-yet-attained - these constitute the five grounds. Though intermediate meditation has contaminant-free true paths, because it lacks sharp contaminant-free [wisdom]. Those having sharp contaminant-free [wisdom] can enter. Also, because Brahmā kings dwell there with much distraction, [it] is not a purely clean ground. The formless [realm] having inferior wisdom is not a path for eliminating delusions - this concerns eliminating discriminative delusions. If [concerning] cultivation delusions, [it] also pervades the formless [realm].

"Sixty-nine explains... because there is the path of seeing": This quotes two texts to prove the support for the path of seeing. *Yogācārabhūmi* sixty-nine says: "Only depending on the various meditations and initial near-division not-yet-attained can [one] enter direct realization of noble truths. Not in formless concentrations." Within formless concentrations, *śamatha* is superior but *vipaśyanā* is inferior. Paths with inferior *vipaśyanā* cannot enter direct realization. Also says: "Three depend on five supports to arise. One type and one division are also thus." If intermediate meditation also had [means to] depend on entering direct realization, [it] should say "three depend on six supports to arise." When initially arising, the three - wisdom, truth, and precepts - only depend on the four fundamental and not-yet-attained five supports to arise, not explaining six grounds. Clearly, intermediate meditation has no [means for] entering direct realization.

"If eliminating cultivation delusions... cannot eliminate delusions": This meaning explains the cultivation path, not the path of seeing. This *Yogācārabhūmi* intention explains the cultivation path of the two vehicles, not the path of seeing of bodhisattvas. Also, "because [it] explains three depending on five supports to arise" - this is the intention of quoting this text. Since [it] already explains the path of seeing depending on five supports to arise, [we] clearly know volume one hundred's text precisely explains the supports of the cultivation path. Why only take the three formless [states] and not explain the summit of existence? Explanation:

Says: Though the summit of existence has wandering-observation contaminant-free [wisdom], because its nature is dark and subtle, [it] does not eliminate bonds. Question: Truth-wisdom direct realization also pervades the cultivation path. Why explain "three only depend on five supports"? How can [we] know it pervades the cultivation path? Because [it] explains "one attains nine universal knowledge fruits." Also because [it] explains "one attains four fruits." Explanation: Examining that treatise text, truth-wisdom direct realization generally has two types. First, established only depending on the path of seeing. Second, established depending on both paths. Depending on the first meaning, [it] explains depending on five supports. Through the latter meaning, [it] explains depending on all. That text also explains depending on all supports, or exhausting all outflows. Though pervading nine supports, establishing direct realization only exists in five supports, hence no contradiction. Precepts, limits, wisdom, and truth should be known similarly.

"Bodhisattvas if eliminating... six formless three": "Only fourth concentration" etc. - the two vehicles depend on five grounds, bodhisattvas only depend on the fourth. Various treatises pervade preparatory [stages], hence discuss "bodhisattvas also depend on five grounds." During previous preparatory times, [though] pervading various meditations, depending on the fourth [one] first attains completion. Namely, when finally entering, [they] only depend on the fourth. The reason this is so is because compared to other meditations, [it] is most excellent. "If eliminating innate" etc. - within cognitive obstacles, subduing innate [obstacles], elimination allows pervading nine grounds. Eliminating both habitual energies is also thus. Question: What is the essence of habitual energies and gross heaviness? Also, how do [they] differ from non-defiled ignorance? Explanation: If depending on Hīnayāna, non-defiled ignorance takes as essence all contaminated and uncontaminated inferior wisdom possessed before attaining Buddhahood. Ignorance is narrow, habitual energies are broad. However, explaining habits has two explanations that are not the same.

【Lower Section】　
One says: Mental factors arising together with inferior wisdom are collectively called habitual energies. One says: Habitual energies not only pervade mind and mental factors but also pervade continuous bodies. Now within Mahāyāna, habitual energies are without substance, ignorance has substance. [They are] precisely included in cognitive obstacles. Non-defiled ignorance is called non-defiled unknowing. Hence according to Dharmapāla and other schools, habitual energies are precisely incapability nature, also called gross heaviness. This gross heaviness and the five aggregates, etc. are neither one nor different, because [they] lack separate essence. Extensively explaining this meaning is like other separate excerpts.

"If eliminating innate... fearing verbosity, not述べる": "If eliminating innate affliction-obstacles only fourth concentration" etc. - this concerns seeds, not speaking of gross heaviness. Gross heaviness is also eliminated within the ten grounds. Innate delusion-obstacles are retained without elimination for benefiting beings. [One] must reach diamond [concentration] and eliminate [them] suddenly all at once. This diamond mind depends on fourth meditation, hence says "also only fourth concentration." Question: Within diamond mind there are precisely two paths. In which [does one] abandon the essence of maturation consciousness? Explanation: Treatises have two explanations. One says: Causes and effects mutually arise, present and seed mutually regard [each other], also being before and after. "No seed already arisen" is *Abhidharmasamuccaya*'s explanation. Through this meaning, though diamond samādhi has not yet become present, it can generate causes, causes perish and can generate effects. At the time of diamond path, though lacking causal seeds, maturation consciousness can arise, because previous moments generating later [moments] does not contradict principle. One says: Present and seed mutual regard must be the same instant. Through this, at the time of diamond uninterrupted path, though lacking two obstacles, because [there are] conventional expression and karmic seeds, maturation consciousness arises. The first master [says] at the uninterrupted path stage, wisdom

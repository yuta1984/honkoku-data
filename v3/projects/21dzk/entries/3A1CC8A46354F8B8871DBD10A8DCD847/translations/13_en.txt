means encompassing the nearby and correct meaning. That is, now explaining "there are One Vehicle fruits etc." and calling it "ultimate truth" is in contrast to indeterminate faculties, considering them and calling it truth, not calling it truth in the sense that there are absolutely no two vehicles and only one exists.

Regarding the text "Therefore the Lotus says... because it does not say three." "Secretly dispatching two people" etc. means there is actually no substance of two. Because it teaches that there are two vehicle teachings, therefore it says "secretly dispatched." Using expedient teachings to transform only the two vehicles, therefore says "two people." "Dim-sighted" means seeing incorrectly. The Shuowen says "lacking one eye." When the eye socket is sunken and constricted, it is called dim. Dim means small. Teaching the established truth teachings for the two vehicles, but the expressive revelation is not perfect, therefore called "dim-sighted." Because the explained emptiness of persons principle is short, it is called "short." Because there are no Dharma body merits and it is ugly, it is called "crude." What is called "resting place" is nirvāṇa with remainder. Because it is the place where two vehicle people rest from suffering, it is called "resting place." Therefore explaining two is the transformed city.

Regarding "If saying circuitous gathering... because it is what should be heard." This breaks the defensive rescue. "The sūtras and treatises' One Vehicle is actually for the indeterminate" etc. means the Ornament Treatise, Compendium Treatise, Presentation Treatise, etc. all explain One Vehicle. And the One Vehicle explained in the Lotus Sūtra - these One Vehicles are all for sustaining indeterminate śrāvakas and dull-faculties bodhisattvas. Why must it be only through sharp-faculties direct progression? Because it is difficult to determine like this, it says "the sūtras and treatises' One Vehicle is actually for the indeterminate." Saying "what difference is there between the two practices and stages" means circuitous gathering and direct progression are stages of causal practice, but since these two causal practices already have no difference, we know Great Vehicle and One Vehicle also have no difference.

Regarding "There are those who explain clinging to Buddha... the three are not so." This breaks the doctrine of masters who cling to Buddha and explain One Vehicle.

"Thirty-four moments" means cutting off the nine grades of afflictions in the Neither-perception-nor-non-perception realm, about to generate nine uninterrupted paths and nine liberation paths. This is the two times nine, eighteen moments. Adding the sixteen minds of the path of seeing to this, it becomes thirty-four moments. Experiencing these moments, one achieves the bodhi stage. Who would generate this clinging? Like the Sarvāstivādins clinging to Buddha's transformation body as the true body, now explaining it as transformation, therefore breaking the three attachments.

Regarding "This is Buddha's extinction... therefore only breaking two." This is the breaking. "Small Vehicle distorted views after Buddha's extinction" etc. means this is the distorted views of Sarvāstivādins and other Small Vehicle schools at the end of two hundred years after Buddha's extinction. How could there be, during Buddha's lifetime, the explanation of One Vehicle to break their actual attachment due to making this Buddha-attachment? The Profound Commentary breaks this saying: The Lotus only takes the One Vehicle obtained through one's own cultivation as its principle, gathering and breaking their vehicles to make them enter one. It does not take the known one body as principle to gather and break that body to make them enter one body. Also, there is no attachment of clinging to that transformation body as ultimate, seeking to reach it, and not seeking other bodies anymore. Now breaking their attachment to make them seek one body, therefore only breaking the clinging to two vehicles as ultimate, not breaking clinging to those two bodies as ultimate. If comprehensively breaking, that meaning would be possible. Now only briefly breaking. Question: If so, during Buddha's lifetime, was there no attachment to the Buddha under the tree as ultimately real? If there was, what fault would there be in breaking this and saying "no three"? Explanation: This breaks their attachments, not separately redirecting practice. Because there is no generating great practice based on the Buddha Vehicle explained in initial teachings.

Regarding "Question: Why establish... vehicles and three vehicles are the same." The meaning of this question: Focusing on the extremely small and extremely many, making comparison and example. If comprehensively making examples, since vehicles already establish one, three, four, etc., why are the piṭakas not so, only establishing two, three, six, etc. piṭakas? Also, since piṭakas already establish two, three, six, etc., why are vehicles not so, only establishing one, three, four, five, etc.?

Regarding "Answer: Vehicle is conveyance... therefore they are not the same." "Clarifying vehicles regarding faculties and practice" etc. - the Compilation changes this saying: Vehicle means the meaning of conveyance. Using practice to look toward fruit to clarify differences is wrong. Generally, the meaning of conveyance, based on causal practice, explains fruit. Without this meaning, by what would it be called vehicle? Therefore the previous section says: If it is the meaning of conveyance, then that fruit is not so. The chapter master's present intention: Due to this principle, only speaks of faculties and practice, not raising that fruit. Since the meaning is already most excellent, why casually change the text? If saying "the previous section only bases on human and divine fruits being non-existent" is incorrect in principle. Human and divine seed-natures are also called vehicles. How could their fruition rewards also be called vehicles? If so, why did it previously say "if it is the meaning of conveyance, that fruit is immediately non-existent"? Therefore we know the original text considers it most excellent.

Regarding "What the sūtras explain... but have not seen the text." "The two and three piṭakas explained in sūtras" etc. - the text of two piṭakas is not clear. However, depending on half and complete, dividing the two piṭakas. The Nirvāṇa Sūtra explains the characters of half and complete. Immediately pointing to that text as the two piṭakas. However, the opening and closing of piṭaka and vehicle names and numbers are not uniform. Sometimes there are piṭakas and vehicles with different names and numbers, like One Vehicle and Three Piṭakas.

Sometimes there are piṃakas and vehicles with uniform names and numbers, like Two Vehicles and Two Piṭakas. Sometimes there are piṭakas and vehicles with the same numbers but different names, like Three Vehicles and Three Piṭakas. The Three Piṭakas are sūtra, vinaya, and abhidharma. Sometimes there are piṭakas and vehicles with the same names but different numbers, like Two Piṭakas and Three Vehicles. The Two Piṭakas are the Śrāvaka and Bodhisattva piṭakas. Generally having the possibility of being the same does not contradict principle - vehicles and piṭakas in comparison also have the possibility of being the same. As the Piṭaka Chapter says: Sometimes depending on the gate of abandoning wrong and returning to right, only explaining one piṭaka, namely the correct Dharma teaching piṭaka. Sometimes explaining two up to eighty-four thousand. This piṭaka is also like this - what is established follows appropriateness and should not be made difficult. Now agreeing with that intention, therefore says "does not contradict principle."

Regarding "Also according to bodhisattvas... should not make uniform criticism." This immediately cites examples to clarify that sameness and difference are indeterminate. The ten evils are the obstacles treated by the ten perfections. The four wheels are what can treat. The eight difficulties are what is treated. Hell beings, animals, hungry ghosts, northern continent, long-lived gods, worldly intelligence and eloquence, incomplete faculties, before and after Buddha - these are the eight difficulties. Speaking of "four wheels": first, dwelling securely in good places, meaning birth in the middle country. Because it is where sagely transformation exists, it is called "good place." Second, depending on good friends, namely birth in Buddha's time. Third, personally generating right vows, namely right view. Fourth, having previously planted good roots, namely keeping precepts. Because precepts are the foundation of all goods, they are called "good roots." Speaking of "wheel" is metaphor. Just as the holy king's wheel has nothing among all enemies that it cannot crush, these four dharmas can also crush the eight difficulties, therefore taking this metaphor. Among the four wheels, the wheel of dwelling securely in good places can treat five difficulties, namely the three evil destinies, northern continent, and long life. The later three wheels treat one difficulty each, namely depending on

At most there are five, blocking realms outside the mind. At least there is one - namely, the three realms are mind-only, which is the fundamental consciousness. Speaking about the fundamental essence, there is only one; speaking about stages, there are only five, so there is neither increase nor decrease. The Compilation says: The Sthavira masters establish nine, which is excessive increase, thus having remaining faults. Harivarman establishes four, which is excessive decrease, thus having the fault of indefiniteness. To block the faults of increase and decrease by other schools, only five minds are established - neither increasing nor decreasing.

Regarding the text "Question: These five minds... also penetrate the uncontaminated." "Some explain seeking-deliberation etc." - regarding seeking-deliberation penetrating the uncontaminated, there are explanations by two masters. First: seeking-deliberation among the five dharmas are only encompassed by discrimination, being only contaminated. The Great Treatise volume five says "All seeking-deliberation are discrimination. There is discrimination that is not seeking-deliberation." The second master says: Abhidharma volume ten and Daśabhūmi Treatise volume one etc. explain "correct contemplation is the cause of verbal expression." Therefore we know seeking penetrates the uncontaminated. Since seeking is thus, deliberation is also thus. Now saying "explained as not penetrating the uncontaminated" corresponds to the first master's position. As Master Zhuang says in Commentary volume seven, the five minds are only contaminated. Namely, the uncontaminated stage is exclusively good, without the meaning of transformation among the three natures. The five minds are not explained. Now this is not the case, so all five penetrate. The Yogācāra commentator Bodhisattva Jiśeṇa says: Like Buddha-bodhisattva supernatural power minds arising naturally, sudden-arising mind conditions objects of three times, seeking-determining etc. condition previous similar objects etc. From this we clearly know the five minds all penetrate the uncontaminated.

Regarding the text "Question: Penetrating three realms... can be simultaneous as appropriate." "The various minds of three realms distinguish consciousness-types" means they can be simultaneous as appropriate.

Eye-ear-body consciousness span two realms and two grounds; nose-tongue consciousness span one realm and one ground; the three consciousnesses six-seven-eight penetrate three realms and nine grounds. Therefore various minds can be simultaneous as appropriate.

Regarding the text "Question: Why apex... because of consciousness-only characteristics." The answer's meaning: To understand the two emptinesses, these five minds are explained. "To make one understand the stages of mind" means showing entry into personal emptiness. "Entering dharma-selflessness" etc. means showing entry into dharma emptiness. What does this meaning mean? To make one understand that the before-after distinctions of mind's arising stages are not permanently one, thus quickly entering the nature of pudgala-selflessness. Also wanting to make known that the conditioned realms of before-after minds all do not separate from mind, only appearing as aggregations upon mind. Therefore thus quickly entering the nature of dharma-selflessness and consciousness-only.

Regarding the text "Question: This explanation of five... only when five minds are complete." "Hearing one character possessing five minds" etc.: According to Chinese language, when explaining the character "Buddha," the name-phrase is already complete and mental understanding is fully perfected. Therefore though one character, it is said to possess five minds. The character "Dharma" is also thus. The rest can be known by analogy.

Regarding the text "If explaining principle-phenomena... said to possess five minds." "Namely according to the many-few of explained characters" etc.: As previously explained, from the one character "Buddha" to the five characters "all dharmas" etc. - this is many-few. The Compilation says: If when name-phrases are complete and mental understanding is perfect, the five minds are possessed, then merely hearing half-names or half-phrases when mental understanding is not perfect - if at this time the five minds are not possessed, what minds arise? The Compilation further decides for itself: The five minds merely explain the stages of mind's arising - there is no need to distinguish their completeness-incompleteness. Therefore if mind does not arise, that is all. If it arises, it necessarily passes through all five stages, only excluding cases where strong conditions intervene and seize. Now rescuing this: "Perfect" means

the meaning of ultimate completion. When understanding arises and reaches completion, it is called perfect. If when hearing half-names etc., the name-phrase is not yet complete, how can the five minds be possessed? When one matter is complete and mental understanding is perfect, then the five minds are possessed. Therefore at the time of half-names, mind arises according to objects but does not necessarily possess all five. Therefore distinguishing complete-incomplete is truly fitting with deep principle.

Regarding the text "For that duration of time... deeply most appropriate." Between the completion of one matter, many moments are experienced, hence "that duration of time." "Following that mental consciousness, encompassed by those mental factors" - by this text proves the seeking of five consciousnesses is positional seeking, not substantial seeking. This can be known from the concluding text. "Yin" means to trust.

Second, it merely follows the explanation of śrāvakas etc. Because what is expected differs, there are contradictions.

Regarding the text "From this assembly... until receiving prophetic prediction." This generally uses separate meanings to show the intention of explaining One Vehicle. Vasubandhu's commentary says: There is also a separate meaning. Namely, in that assembly there are various bodhisattvas with the same names as them, receiving Buddha's prediction. Based on this intention of dharma-nature equality, the One Vehicle is therefore explained. Question: Within the two aspirations, there are already three distinctions of Buddha, Two Vehicles, and bodhisattva. Why is it not three intentions but only called two aspirations? Answer: Zhizhou says: Self-other make two. Two Vehicles and bodhisattvas have equal other-meanings. Now comparing self-other, it is called two aspirations. In principle it could be called three.

Regarding the text "Nine transformational manifestations... manifesting parinirvāṇa." This clarifies the seventh expedient transformation intention. Vasubandhu and Asvabhāva generally say: To transform śrāvakas etc., showing manifestation of parinirvāṇa the same as them. Among the śrāvakas being transformed, they do not distinguish between determined and undetermined natures. The Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṃkāra and old Mahāyānasaṃgraha only address undetermined-nature śrāvakas, causing them to abandon the small and enter Mahāyāna. The Compilation says: The chapter master without distinction saying all are "to lead those undetermined seed-natures to enter Mahāyāna" is incorrect.

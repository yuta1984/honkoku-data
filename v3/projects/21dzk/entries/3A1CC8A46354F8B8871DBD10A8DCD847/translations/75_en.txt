[this] can be known. Saying "as above" refers precisely to the text about sunlight, isolated incense, etc. being separate from great elements. Hence knowing [this is] not the dependency cause among the five. Now I consider [this] not so. The text below already says that separated substantial light, etc. have no dependency cause meaning. Hence knowing [this is] the dependency cause of the five causes.

From "Dependency cause" to "no separate dwelling place": In this text, "various derived forms depend on great elements, etc." and below are the chapter compiler's text. From "that" and above are all treatise text. "This is precisely the transformation cause" has two explanations. First, using the meaning of transformation to briefly explain the name "dependency." Second, taking the *Yogācārabhūmi*'s dependency cause to correspond to the fundamental collection's transformation cause. The dependency cause meaning, regarding depending on those productive [causes] for transformation, hence saying "this is precisely the transformation cause." "Having no capacity to depend on separate places" means various derived forms depend on great [elements] to arise. Hence abandoning great elements, [there is] no separate dwelling place. Contradictory texts are as explained below.

From "*Yogācārabhūmi* volume 3" to "hence named dependency cause": In this text, the three characters "named dependency cause" are the chapter compiler's added text. The rest is all treatise text. "Derived forms, having arisen, do not leave the place of great elements but transform" explains co-substantial production. Among same and different aggregates, [it is] same aggregate production, not different production. Among real and provisional production, [it is] real production, not provisional production. Among intimate and remote production, this is intimate, not remote. Among same and different realms, [it is] same realm production, not different realm. Among same and different natures, [it is] same nature production, not different nature. The reason for this is because various sunlight, isolated incense, etc. are separate from great elements. Concentration-path precept forms arising in the formless realm have no four great [elements]. If regarding remote meaning, having power depending on those, all have dependency causes.

From "If so, how" to "hence no contradiction": In this text, from "now depending on co-substantial" below is the chapter

compiler's text. From "that" and above is all treatise text. [*Yogācārabhūmi*] 54 says: "Also, light emitted outside separated from wheels, remaining great elements and fragrances, etc., all cannot be obtained" (above is treatise text). That great elements, fragrances, etc. cannot be obtained means: if following Hinayana, all forms in the desire realm definitely do not separate from fragrance and taste. Mahayana is not so, because there are those that separate. However, now this text contradicts the sustaining cause among the five causes. That says "because equal measure is not destroyed." As explained in the reconciliation below. In this text, Master Ji's *Yogācārabhūmi* commentary describes two explanations: "However, the great master says there are two explanations in the West. First explanation: there are separated substantial derived forms. Like sunlight, remotely produced from wheel great [elements], not having great [elements] in the same place." Taking this as proof, the sustaining cause among the five causes speaks based on co-substantial great [elements]. Second explanation also has great element production. Like light, those great [elements] also separately produce that light, etc. However, being elicited as conditions from fire great [elements] in the original wheel, [they are] subtle and cannot be obtained. Here saying none exist. In light, how could there be no heat touch? Speaking of heat touch as provisional means taking fire great [elements] as essence. How could there be heat touch not arising from fire? Hence knowing there also is [fire]. If following the previous explanation, heat touch within is still the heat of fire power portions in the sun wheel, not fire great [elements] producing light forms. Sound can be known by analogy. Why are there no fragrances and tastes in separated light? Explanation: because fragrances and tastes are light, there are none in light. Because forms and heat touch are heavy, there are also some in light. If touch being heavy exists, fire great [elements] should exist in light - why say there are none? Now saying none means those producing light, not saying there is no powerful heat fire in the sun. If so, [one] can also say fragrances are light with none together with light, and also remotely separately from sun wheel place power portion fragrances? Answer: because of wheels, as before. Another explanation: because there is heat

touch but no other three great [elements]. Saying none does not mean fire great [elements] also do not exist" (above is commentary text). Now saying "depending on co-substantial to discern dependency causes, etc." is the intention of the first explanation.

From "Or explaining that light" to "hence the previous explanation is good": "Or explaining, etc." is the second explanation among the great master's two explanations. As already described before. "This explanation is not so, etc." is the chapter compiler refuting the second explanation. "What great [elements] produce separated substantial sounds and fragrances?" - if the second master rescues by saying: "Like separated wheel light, wherever there is light there are also great element productions. Separated substantial sounds and fragrances are also like this. Following where sounds and fragrances reach, becoming produced by great elements at ear and nose places - what obstruction is there? Hence your criticism has no contradiction for me." Now assisting the chapter master: if regarding remote production, I also permit this. If regarding intimate production, this is also not so. Generally intimate production meaning [involves] same-aggregate great elements necessarily producing same-aggregate forms, not producing different-aggregate forms. Great [elements] at places reached are already different aggregates - how can [they] obtain intimate production? Also contradicting *Yogācārabhūmi* 54's text on "productive and produced being in same place without separation." Your rescue has no benefit at all. Hence the previous explanation is good.

From "Establishing cause" to "sharing safety and danger": In this text, from "establishing cause" down to "transformation therefore" is *Abhidharmasamuccaya* treatise text. From "productive" down to "produced following transformation" is the chapter compiler's explanatory text. "Precisely the following-transformation cause" has two explanations. First, using the meaning of following-transformation to briefly explain the established name. Second, taking the *Yogācārabhūmi*'s establishing cause to correspond to the fundamental collection's following-transformation cause. Establishing, regarding accomplishing those effects, following great [elements'] transformation and change - this is establishing cause meaning. Saying "because of great [elements'] transformation, etc." means because great [elements] have increase and decrease, the produced follow in transformation. Question: If saying "because of great [elements'] transformation, dependent produced forms follow in transformation," how should [we] reconcile *Yogācārabhūmi* 54's text? That says: "Regarding produced forms and great elements, should [we] say there are different characteristics or no different characteristics?" Answer: "Combining, there are four different characteristics. The third characteristic says: 'Transformation and non-transformation can be manifestly obtained. Namely, in frying butter, etc., obtainable differences of transformation in form, taste, etc. can be obtained, not in those solid, etc. Therefore [one] should know great elements and produced forms have different characteristics.'" Already saying "great elements and produced forms' transformation and non-transformation are different," how now say "when great [elements] transform, produced [forms] follow in transformation"? Explanation: *Yogācārabhūmi* 54's intention, to refute different calculations, explains having different characteristics. Like Buddhadeva calculating no separate produced forms outside the four great [elements]. To refute that calculation, clarifying four great [elements] and produced forms have different natures and characteristics, different essences and functions. Namely four great [elements'] nature opposed to produced forms' characteristics, and four great [elements'] essence opposed to produced forms' function, explaining having different characteristics. In this text now, great [elements'] nature and produced nature, great [elements'] essence and produced essence are explained in opposition. Hence saying "when great [elements] transform, produced [forms] follow in transformation." Hence no contradiction. This meaning is profound and subtle - scholars should contemplate. Saying "safety and danger necessarily same" means safety is increase meaning, danger is decrease meaning. Productive and produced necessarily have same increase and decrease. Like depending on sense organs' clarity and dullness, consciousness is also clear and dull. This is also like this. Through great [elements'] increase and decrease, produced [forms] also increase and decrease. Hence saying "safety and danger necessarily same." Saying "because of great elements' loss and benefit, they share safety and danger" refers to *Yogācārabhūmi* volume 3, at the beginning of explaining the five aggregate dharmas, in explaining form aggregate various dharmas, first making five questions, investigating the meaning of those four great [elements] making five causes to produce forms. This answers the third question "how are they established." Through this precisely showing that through establishing meaning, [one] obtains the establishing cause name. However Master Fan uses establishing meaning to explain establishing cause meaning. The intention is also

The three natures are consciousness-only. Apart from the three natures, there is no separate consciousness-only. Volume nine of the treatise says: "Consciousness-only nature briefly has two kinds: first, false, namely parikalpita (imagined nature); second, real, namely pariniṣpanna (perfected nature). There are also two kinds: first, conventional, namely paratantra (dependent nature); second, ultimate, namely pariniṣpanna (perfected nature)." Therefore we know that the three natures are all called consciousness-only. Regarding "conditioning these as objects" etc.: All knowable things generally have three kinds. First is unequaled objects, namely the two truths and three natures etc. The two truths are common objects of the three vehicles. The three natures and other principles are exclusively bodhisattva objects. Second is unequaled practices, namely the explained śamatha-vipaśyanā and ten perfections etc. Śamatha-vipaśyanā are common practices of the three vehicles. The ten perfections and other practices are exclusively bodhisattva practices. Third is unequaled results, namely wisdom-elimination and the three body results. Wisdom-elimination are common results of the three vehicles. The three bodies are exclusively attained by bodhisattvas. Now saying "three natures etc." refers to the first unequaled objects among the three unequaled. Therefore it says "conditioning these as objects."

Regarding the text "first worldly... one true dharma-realm": "Namely two emptinesses thus" etc. If one only says "emptiness," this means the absence of two graspings. If one says "emptiness-nature," using emptiness as gate, the revealed emptiness-nature is true-suchness. In Sanskrit "śūnya" is just called emptiness. Saying "śūnyatā," therefore explaining true-suchness is called "emptiness-nature." Because "tā" translated means the meaning of nature. Regarding "fourth ultimate ultimate truth": "Namely non-established two emptiness selflessness one true dharma-realm" - Question: Two emptiness selflessness both aim at establishment, so why also say "non-established two emptiness selflessness"? Explanation: Raising the explanation to grasp the meaning. Therefore this is indicated. Properly one should only say "non-established, abandoning explanation, discussing meaning, one true dharma-realm."

Regarding the text "what's realized and grasped... not two-vehicle objects": This text reveals that bodhisattva two truths differ from two

vehicles. "What's realized and grasped" etc.: What bodhisattvas realize is two emptiness wisdom. What's grasped is two graspings. Though dharma-grasping is common, it doesn't obstruct the two vehicles, so it differs from them. What two vehicles realize is person emptiness wisdom. What's grasped is two graspings. This contrasts delusion-enlightenment to reveal differences. Saying "what's realized and eliminated": what bodhisattvas realize is two emptiness principle. What's eliminated is two graspings and two obstructions. What two vehicles realize is person emptiness principle. What's eliminated is person-grasping and afflictive obstructions. This contrasts elimination-realization to reveal differences. Saying "broad-narrow also differ": broad refers to bodhisattvas, narrow refers to two vehicles. Many treatises explain the second and third conventional, three categories and four truths as essential nature, which refers to the common objects of three vehicles. Because bodhisattvas also know two-vehicle objects. Other texts can be understood.

Regarding the text "among two four truths... self inner realization": "Among two four truths" means within bodhisattva two truths, conventional four and ultimate four are called "two four truths." The meaning of this text explains the differences between established and non-established by comparing ultimate and conventional. Therefore, if distinguished by emptiness and existence: the four levels of conventional include both emptiness and existence. The four levels of ultimate are only existence, not emptiness. Emptiness means non-existence. Parikalpita has only false grasping with essence but is actually empty and non-existent. Therefore it's not ultimate. This follows Dharmapāla's reasonable perfect-real school. If following Bhāviveka's ultimate-all-empty school, all dharmas may exist conventionally but are all empty ultimately. Therefore the four-level differences aren't explained.

Regarding the text "speaking of shallow-deep... pervading two four truths": Inferior principles are called conventional truth. Superior principles are called ultimate truth. Therefore shallow-deep differ. Depending on persons and dharmas, principles have shallow-deep, and wisdom-objects have

coarse-subtle sequential differences. Therefore the two truths each have four levels. Question: Speaking of person-dharma each having two truths, don't we know that person two truths and dharma two truths each have four levels? Explanation: In this text, regarding dharma two truths, the four-level differences are clarified. Only in person two truths, contrasting ordinary-sage, two paired differences are clarified. Though four levels aren't explained, this principle could also exist. The text is simply abbreviated.

Regarding the text "depending on person shallow-deep... first meaning truth": This is all sūtra text, namely from the thirteenth text. This contrasts ordinary-sage regarding wisdom coarse-subtle to explain person two truths. "What transcendent persons know is called first meaning truth; what worldly persons know is called world truth" is the latter text. "World truth is first meaning truth; having skillful means, following sentient beings, explaining there are two truths" is the former text. Now to complete the meaning, conveniently cited. Therefore it doesn't contradict what sages have collected and produced. "Following sentient beings, explaining there are two truths" generally clarifies the intention of explaining two truths. For sentient beings' realization and understanding, provisionally establishing names and characteristics. Following sentient beings, explaining there are two truths. "Like five aggregates combining, calling someone so-and-so" etc. separately reveals the differential characteristics of two truths. If following sūtra text, there are eight "furthermore"s. This is also the first, regarding person differences, explaining differential characteristics. Like one illusory appearance: the magician knows it's non-existent - this metaphorically sees the ultimate. Ordinary beings grasp it as real - this metaphorically sees the conventional. Therefore depending on persons, there are shallow-deep.

Regarding the text "depending on dharma shallow-deep... should extensively reveal": Traditional explanation: person shallow-deep corresponds to the previous delusion-enlightenment two truths. Dharma shallow-deep corresponds to the previously explained dharma-essence two truths. This explanation is difficult to understand. In what was previously

【Lower Section】
explained, which two truths are indicated to explain delusion-enlightenment etc.? If from the seven sets, first delusion-enlightenment two truths, latter six dharma-essence two truths. In what was explained above, what is indicated to establish correspondences? Now explaining: person-dharma shallow-deep means principle shallow-deep. Wisdom-object coarse-subtle divides the two differences. Principle shallow-deep universally pervades person-dharma. Wisdom-object coarse-subtle each have their unity. The reason this is so: generally discussing two truths universally pervades person-dharma. Based on wisdom-object coarse-subtle, person two truths are explained. Regarding object coarse-subtle, dharma two truths are explained. This meaning's extensive explanation is like the Vimalā commentary. "In the teaching inclusion below should extensively reveal" means among the seven sets, the first set repeatedly explains person two truths. The latter six sets, depending on dharma superior-inferior, establish relative correspondences. Now saying "dharma shallow-deep" refers to the latter six sets. Therefore pointing to that text.

Regarding the text "like five aggregate dharmas... revealing true-suchness": Below this, the chapter master, regarding object coarse-subtle, clarifies dharma two truths. Within this there are two parts: first clarifying conventional four, then clarifying ultimate four. This is the first. That is, on one dharma, complete true-conventional differences exist. In Bhāviveka's one-dharma time, existence meaning is conventional, non-existence meaning is ultimate. Now temporarily raising the five aggregates to know myriad dharmas are also thus. Question: Three categories, four truths etc. comparing to explain dharma shallow-deep - this meaning is reasonable. On one five aggregates, there are no further coarse-subtle. How now say "on one dharma, complete true-conventional exist"? Explanation: The five aggregates' essence is difficult to mix coarse-subtle. Four meanings suddenly each have differences. Namely: name, phenomena, principle, explanation are conventional four meanings. Phenomena, principle, explanation, meaning are ultimate four meanings. This doesn't lack coarse-subtle shallow-deep.

forms etc." This meaning is profound and subtle. Students should contemplate it.

From "Fifty-four explains" to "should not be separately explained": This cites text to prove what was stated above: "mutually depending and existing is the meaning of 'creating.'" "Depending on the location of great elements, derived forms arise" etc. explains the first of the five types of arising, namely dependent arising. Master Jing says: "At initial birth, first there are great elements, and depending on their locations, other forms arise dependently. This is called creating."

"Also knowing that what is created by those great elements can be obtained in this aggregate, immediately there are those dharmas in this" means: if in form aggregates there are earth great elements, or other great elements, and there are created [forms], whether roots or objects, then there are those dharmas. "Those dharmas" refers to root-object dharmas. Treatise fifty-four explains the meaning of creating: "The meaning of embracing and maintaining in the same location is called creating. Namely, earth great elements embrace and maintain forms in the same location, hence called creating."

"Hence various great elements etc." is the chapter master's text. Whether retribution category, long-cultivation category, or equal-flow category - regardless of which category, those existing in the same aggregate mutually depending are all called creating. Not only do retribution great elements create retribution forms, but also obtain long-cultivation forms etc. Each of these mutually obtains the meaning of creating. The Sarvāstivādins etc. hold that atomic particles are each separate, clustering together with different essences, same and different categories being separate, abiding without obtaining mutual creation. Now distinguishing from that school, hence saying "not the meaning of fixed belonging." The present Mahāyāna school holds that same and different categories are all great element created without separate atomic particles. Following whatever aggregates exist, all mutually interpenetrate, obtaining mutual creation meaning. Now not the same as them, hence saying "differs from Hīnayāna."

From "herein or possible" to "the former explanation is good": This is the second explanation. The *Abhidharma Viniscaya* says: "Question: The four great elements have three [types] - retribution, long-cultivation, and equal-flow. Can they obtain mutual creation or not? A dharma master says: Each separately creates without mutual creation." [Above is viniscaya text] Now herein saying "same category creates" corresponds to that master's position. However in the *Abhidharma Viniscaya*, "a dharma master says" - it's unclear which master's position this is. The remainder is as that explanation.

"Later arising present activity each depends on its own category" means the three categories accordingly each depend on their own categories. "Mutually depending and existing, explained as called creating" etc. - this is the correct position. Though the three categories differ, in the same aggregate mutually depending and existing are all explained as called creating. The three categories mutually depending each create each other. This creating meaning is as already explained before.

Question: When retribution and long-cultivation two types of four great elements create those retribution and long-cultivation roots, do they create sequentially or simultaneously?

Explanation: In the *Abhidharma Viniscaya*, describing Master Tai and others' position: "If retribution roots initially arise first, long-cultivation later immediately arises. Retribution great elements first create retribution roots; long-cultivation great elements later create long-cultivation roots. If retribution roots simultaneously have long-cultivation roots, the two types of four great elements should simultaneously create them. Now explaining: At initial birth, only having retribution great elements and roots arise first; later obtaining long-cultivation conditions, then having long-cultivation roots and great elements. Therefore at initial birth time, not yet having long-cultivation conditions, only having retribution roots and great elements. Not the same as Sarvāstivāda simultaneous arising." [Above is viniscaya text] Extensively explaining questions and answers about these four great elements has eighteen questions. All as those explanations. Due to complexity, not describing.

From "immediately apart from great element created" to "called apart-from-substance creating": Some versions say "immediately apart from great elements, mutually regarding, distinguishing creating." According to the initial heading, should say "immediate-apart great element created." The meaning is also good. In immediate-apart creating, initially is immediate-substance creating. Creating and created correspond, their quantities being equal. Just as the five objects attach to substance, immediately equaling the substance's quantity; when distant, then greater than the substance.

Creating has two meanings: First, real direct creating. This must be same nature, not different nature creating. Must be same category creating, not different category creating. Conditioned and unconditioned must be same category. Must be same realm creating, not different realm creating. Concentrated and scattered must be same, not different creating. These are called immediate-substance creating meaning.

Second, provisional distant creating. This distantly mutually depending also obtains suspended creating. Not necessarily same nature. Initial real direct creating exists only in immediate-substance; latter provisional distant creating also extends to apart-from-substance. As Master Ji's *Yogācāra Commentary* explains.

From "Sixty-four explains" to "cannot be spoken": Below cites text proving apart-from-substance creating meaning. Initial immediate-substance creating has easily understood meaning. Latter apart-from-substance creating meaning is somewhat difficult to know. Hence citing text as proof. Briefly citing two texts. This is the initial text.

"Sixty-four" - examining sixty-four, completely lacking this text. Only fifty-four has this text. Hence *Yogācārabhūmi* fifty-four says: "Also light emitted outside apart from the wheel - remaining great elements, smell etc. all cannot be obtained." In the *Compilation* citing fifty-four text. The chapter master's *Yogācāra Commentary* explains this text saying "there are two explanations."

Western first explanation says: "There is apart-from-substance created form. Like the sun wheel's light distantly created from wheel great elements, not merely having great elements at locations." Using this text as proof. Among five causes, the supporting cause speaks according to immediate-substance great elements.

Second explanation says:

【Lower Section】
"Having great element created like light. Those great elements also have separately creating those lights etc., but from original wheel's internal fire great elements as conditions inducing arising, hence subtle and unobtainable. Herein saying none. In light, how could there be no hot tangible? Hot tangible is called provisional, immediately taking fire great elements as essence. How could hot tangible arise apart from fire? Hence knowing also having. If the previously explained hot tangible in sunlight, this returns to being heat from fire's powerful portion in the sun wheel, not fire great elements creating light forms. Sound should be known by analogy to this.

Question: Why are there no smells-tastes? Smells-tastes being light, immediately absent in light. Forms and hot tangibles being heavy, also present in light." [Above is commentary text]

"Apart-from-substance light-smell" below is the chapter master's text. Immediately corresponding to the first explanation among two explanations. "Originating location four great elements" refers to sun wheel four great elements. "Dwelling place dependence" means remaining near-far places excluding the sun wheel, called "dwelling places." "Dependence" refers to creating great elements. When that light reaches locations, whether near or far, without separate creating [great elements]. Only in the original sun wheel having great elements creating light. Hence saying "no dwelling place dependence."

From "Various discipline precepts" to "non-separation creating": Briefly citing two texts proving apart-from-substance creating meaning, this is the second text. "Various discipline precepts" etc. - the three types of concentration, path, and individual liberation being not one, hence saying "various."

"Depending on non-manifest dharmas" etc. - Master Fan says: "Speaking truthfully, wholesome-unwholesome non-manifest seeds mutually prevent each other. However in the *Prakaraṇa* treatise, only regarding unwholesome body-speech having prevention and non-prevention, hence explaining discipline. However preventing those evil body-speech from manifesting, immediately in

through causes. The defiled-pure of the five consciousnesses arises through only one cause - namely, through what was previously drawn. Since we are now speaking about the defiled-pure mind of the five consciousnesses, it says "through what is drawn, up to the arising of defiled-pure dharmas." "Not through one's own discriminative power" clarifies that among the two causes, the discriminative cause is lacking. To reveal the general meaning: the five minds of one's own consciousness arise in succession, while other consciousnesses arise without interruption. Therefore it says "both self and others are undisturbed."

Regarding the text "Others disturbed, self undisturbed... up to arising seeking mind." That the five minds of one's own consciousness still arise in sequence means they arise without disturbing the sequence. "As Yogācāra explains, etc." cites two texts to prove that seeking necessarily arises after sudden arising. The first is from volume three, the latter from volume sixty-three. That seeking definitely arises after the five sudden arisings refers to encountering unfamiliar objects. If it concerns familiar objects, then it is indefinite.

Regarding the text "Someone says... because it contradicts doctrine and principle." Master Wŏnhyo and others also use this interpretation, as in the Golden Drum Commentary. "Contradicts doctrine and principle" - the doctrine is Yogācāra volume three saying "After one moment of the five consciousnesses arises, mental consciousness necessarily arises immediately afterward." When it says "mental consciousness," this is seeking. The principle is that if encountering unfamiliar objects, after sudden arising, seeking necessarily arises. This principle is definite. This master's interpretation contradicts this doctrine and principle, hence "contradicts doctrine and principle." If already familiar or in a state of mastery, after sudden mind, seeking does not arise but determination immediately arises. As Yogācāra explains, the mental consciousness arising immediately after the five consciousnesses is either seeking or determining. Explaining the word "either" shows it is not definitely one. However, following the majority, seeking arises first, as explained in the Commentary.

Regarding the text "Yogācāra also says... entering defiled-pure stage." "Immediately after seeking, sometimes scattered, etc." - this text only explains that after seeking is indefinite. It does not say that after determining and after defiled-pure are indefinite. This is because in principle all are connected, as explained in the Yogācāra Commentary. "Or entering other minds" refers to defiled-pure and other minds. "Drawn away" - "away" means easily forgotten.

Regarding the text "When defiled-pure stage arises... disturbed self undisturbed." "Because it permits multiple moments" - the defiled-pure of eye-consciousness, being difficult to arise, continues for multiple moments. This follows the correct interpretation that permits the five consciousnesses to have defiled-pure mind. Therefore, if following the first master, this text is very difficult. That master permits that during mental consciousness defiled-pure stage, the five consciousnesses do not arise. If it were mental consciousness defiled-pure mind, mental consciousness defiled-pure is only one moment. After the second moment, it immediately belongs to uniform flow. How could it be called "multiple moments"? From this it is clearly known that the first interpretation is incorrect.

Regarding the text "Third, self disturbed mind... below all should be understood by analogy." "Self disturbed, mind undisturbed" means: although ear and other consciousnesses do not arise discontinuously, within eye-consciousness, other objects seize and arise, other object-minds cease, and one's own mind arises again. Therefore it says "self disturbed, mind undisturbed." "Or immediately determining" means: after previous sudden arising, if one has not sought long, seeking arises again and draws forth determination. If one has already sought long, seeking does not arise but determination immediately arises. Therefore it says "or immediately arises determination."

Regarding the text "Or from initial mind... disturbed mind undisturbed." "Initially arising defiled-pure" refers to one's own defiled-pure mind. The text is clear and easy to understand.

Regarding the text "Above clarifying non-... other minds follow this pattern." The text is clear and knowable. "If arising consecutively... uniform-flow mind, etc." - some texts say "If not contradicting, arising next up to uniform-flow mind, then called undisturbed." The textual variants have the same meaning. Question: After uniform-flow mind, do the previous four minds arise again? Answer: Wŏnhyo says uniform-flow five consciousnesses do not immediately arise seeking and determining. The reason is that after arising and determining, defiled-pure finally arises. After defiled-pure mind, uniform flow arises. Therefore it is known that immediately afterward, defiled-pure mind and others arise again, as in the Golden Drum Commentary. In the present chapter master's view, there is no clear text. Speaking according to principle, since uniform-flow mind is permitted to last multiple moments, after uniform flow, previous minds do not arise again.

flow mind, etc." Some texts say "If not contradicting, arising next up to uniform-flow mind, then it is called undisturbed." The different meanings of the texts are the same. Question: After uniform-flow mind, do the previous four minds arise again? Answer: Wŏnhyo says that immediately after uniform-flow five consciousnesses, seeking and determining do not arise. The reason is that after arising and determining, defiled-pure finally arises. After defiled-pure mind, uniform flow arises. Therefore it is known that immediately afterward defiled-pure mind and others arise again, as in the Golden Drum Commentary. In the present chapter master's intention, there is no clear text. Speaking according to principle, since uniform-flow mind is permitted to be multiple moments, after uniform flow, previous minds do not arise again.

Regarding the text "Self-disturbed mind also... other methods are the same." Only through eye-object-consciousness-mind being mutually disturbed, not through being disturbed by sound and other objects. Therefore it says "self-disturbed mind is also disturbed." The text is clear and knowable.

Regarding the text "Sixth, various minds... because they can arise together." "Eight consciousnesses arising together at one time" - Yogācāra volume fifty-one, Vijñaptimātratā volume five, etc., all say "Ālaya-consciousness turns together with seven consciousnesses at one time." Therefore it is known that the five minds of various consciousnesses mutually influence each other and arise simultaneously.

Regarding the text "There is also eye-consciousness... because there is no theoretical obstruction." Simultaneous mental consciousness theoretically exists without doubt, so it is not mentioned. Question: For instance, with eye-consciousness sudden arising having neutral nature and ear-consciousness uniform flow having good nature, what nature does the mental consciousness arising together with these two consciousnesses have? Answer: If the eye-consciousness sudden arising object is strong and the ear-consciousness uniform flow object is weak, then it follows the strong one in determining nature. If the uniform flow object is strong, then it follows that one in determining nature. Question: If so, the mental consciousness arising together with uniform-flow ear-consciousness is already of good nature. Why does it draw neutral eye-consciousness? Although neutral does not contradict good and bad, good

and bad contradict neutral. Answer: Like mental consciousness in concentration - although it is of good nature, it can draw neutral ear-consciousness. What prevents mental consciousness arising together with ear-consciousness uniform flow from being able to draw neutral eye-consciousness, even though it is of good or bad nature? This principle is somewhat difficult. Students should reflect on it.

Regarding the text "Like eye-consciousness arising... therefore it is not explained." "Since it is not correct doctrine" - Hīnayāna Sarvāstivāda and others do not permit six consciousnesses to arise together simultaneously. This master's interpretation is the same as different schools where minds do not arise together. Therefore it says "since it is not correct doctrine."

Regarding the text "Seventh, beginning and end... because of encountering separately." "Sudden arising and seeking minds are many, uniform flow few" means: the five consciousnesses simultaneously encounter different objects and generate the first two minds, not yet arising other minds. At that time, eye-consciousness suddenly encounters a new object and immediately arises from sudden arising up to uniform flow. This time is called "sudden arising and seeking minds are many, uniform flow mind few." "Or sudden arising and seeking few, uniform flow minds many" means: the five consciousnesses simultaneously encounter new objects, arise sudden arising mind up to defiled-pure, not yet arising uniform flow. Since it is permitted that defiled-pure of the five consciousnesses lasts multiple moments, at that time one eye-consciousness again encounters a new object and arises sudden arising mind up to uniform flow. Then the defiled-pure of mental consciousness simultaneous with eye-consciousness draws forth eye-consciousness uniform flow and the uniform flow of the previous four consciousnesses. In this time, there are combined the two minds of eye-consciousness sudden arising and seeking, plus the six-consciousness uniform flow now drawn forth. Therefore it says "the first two minds are few, uniform flow minds are many." This now-drawn six-consciousness uniform flow depends on the power of the defiled-pure of mental consciousness arising together with the previous five consciousnesses.

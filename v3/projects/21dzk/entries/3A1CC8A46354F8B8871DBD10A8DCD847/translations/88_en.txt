The five internal form roots possess two retributions and two long-cultivations means: root forms only have two categories, without equal-flow categories. This refers to original-nature equal-flow. Question: Equal-flow has four [types]. How could there be no retribution and long-cultivation equal-flows? How can one say there are no equal-flow categories?

Explanation: Apart from the two categories of retribution and long-cultivation, there is no separate equal-flow outside. Hence not explaining having [them]. Now regarding original-nature, explaining no equal-flow. That transformation equal-flow's presence or absence is indefinite. If there is striking-touching, there is [transformation equal-flow]; if there is no striking-touching, there isn't. Hence not explaining having [it]. Reasonably it can also exist, as the *Yogācāra Commentary* explains.

From "dharma-source various forms" to "no initial long-cultivation": Having latter long-cultivation without place extensive-pervasive etc. Fifty-four says: "Forms included in dharma-source have no retribution-arising flow. The remainder should be known like mind and mental factors." [Above is commentary text] Explanation: Dharma-source included forms have provisional and real. Concentration-fruit real forms have two equal-flows and only one long-cultivation. Sometimes extending to place extensive-pervasive. Dharma-source provisional forms have only one long-cultivation. Excluding place extensive-pervasive, extending to two equal-flows. This is the chapter master's *Yogācāra Commentary* explanation. Now in this chapter there are latter three equal-flows - how does this differ?

Explanation: That *Yogācāra Commentary's* intention: apart from mutually flourishing long-cultivation flow, there is no separate equal-flow outside. Therefore not raising long-cultivation equal-flow, only saying having latter two equal-flows. Now in this chapter, completely raising three equal-flows, hence no contradiction.

Master Jing says: "Among dharma-source forms, extremely subtle and extremely circular are provisional. Analyzing down to fine atomic particles, without real form essence. This is merely when provisionally analyzing forms through cognition, what is obtained in mind's aspect-portion is equal-flow flow. Non-manifest forms immediately regarding manifest forms' seeds, provisionally establishing obtaining original-nature equal-flow flow. Like wholesome-unwholesome

disciplines. Having flourishing meaning, also having second long-cultivation flow. Colors produced by concentration and image colors arising from conceptual construction are also original-nature equal-flow and second mutually flourishing flow, as in that *Yogācāra Commentary*."

Regarding various mind and mental factors: Fifty-four says: "Various mind and mental factors have equal-flow flow, retribution-arising flow, and second mutually flourishing long-cultivation flow." [Above is treatise text] Explanation: Various mind and mental factors responding to wholesome-unwholesome karma are retribution equal-flow. Wholesome-unwholesome mental dharmas and deportment, craftsmanship, transformation etc. are original-nature equal-flow. Those previous wholesome-unwholesome dharmas, through food etc. conditions, having essence-aspects flourish is called long-cultivation flow. Because not form dharmas, without place extensive-pervasive long-cultivation. Hence saying "no initial long-cultivation."

From "form realm various aggregates" to "all extend to meditative equipoise": This distinguishes by realm the abundance or scarcity of long-cultivation conditions. Fifty-four says: "Desire realm various forms completely through four foods and all other long-cultivation causes and conditions obtain long-cultivation. Form realm various forms do not obtain long-cultivation through solid food, sleep, and pure conduct." Explanation: Solid food takes smell-taste as essence. Form realm lacks smell-taste, hence not through solid food. Generally sleep arising depends on three conditions: first depending on food-drink, second depending on seasons, third depending on mind arising. The first two conditions extend to arhats; the latter one condition exists only in ordinary beings. In the upper two realms, these conditions don't exist. Hence not through sleep. Extensively explaining this meaning is like the *Testament Treatise*. Maintaining body through pure conduct exists only in desire realm; upper realms lack this matter. Hence not through pure conduct.

Question: Cultivating excellent attention in pure conduct also extends to upper realms. How could upper realms lack pure conduct?

Explanation: In upper realms, though cultivating attention, not a cause for maintaining body. Only for attaining concentration cultivating attention. Hence upper realm aggregates are not long-cultivated by pure conduct, only long-cultivated by meditative equipoise. "Long-cultivation of three realms all extends to meditative equipoise" means: if explaining according to difficulty, body being in desire realm, cultivating and attaining upper concentration, through that concentration's power nourishing desire-form-mind, hence desire's long-cultivation also extends to meditative equipoise.

From "within internal-external clusters" to "not for distinguishing essence": Within internal-external clusters, accordingly sometimes having three, two, or one category of great element created forms means: if supporting root-objects etc., completely possessing three categories. If five root forms etc., only having two categories, without original-nature equal-flow. If wholesome-unwholesome provisional body-speech karma forms and external vessels etc., only having equal-flow flow, without other retribution etc. If external vessels etc. have definite long-cultivation, can also extend to long-cultivation. Thus accordingly internal-external various forms possess three, two, or one categories.

These three categories each have creating and created. Each following its category, called its great element created forms. Namely retribution great element created, up to equal-flow great element created. These three categories of great element created forms further mutually regarding each other can each mutually create. Immediately explaining this meaning, briefly there are two aspects: first clarifying three categories' four great elements each separately creating forms; second clarifying three categories' four great elements mutually creating forms.

In the initial separate creation, those created immediately return to being included in each separate three categories. Namely retribution great elements create internal body's retribution ten forms. Those long-cultivation great elements can create long-cultivation form roots and internal-external eleven source forms. Those equal-flow great elements can create equal-flow external six source form-sounds etc. In the latter mutual creation:

【Lower Section】
First, retribution four great elements can create concentration long-cultivation form-sounds. Hence sixty-six says: "If that concentrated mind contemplates desire realm formed dharmas and images arise, should be called desire realm great element created" etc. [Above is treatise text] These desire realm great elements already extend to retribution etc. Hence knowing this concentration's long-cultivation forms are created from retribution great elements.

Second, retribution four great elements can create equal-flow form-sounds etc. Namely like retribution form-sounds can express internal wholesome-unwholesome thoughts, immediately called equal-flow form-sounds. These equal-flow form-sounds can be created from retribution great elements.

Those long-cultivation four great elements can create retribution root-objects means: namely food-drink etc. long-cultivate four great elements and root-objects. After being long-cultivated, also causing retribution root-objects to become flourishing and extensive. Immediately through that long great elements' power, retribution roots excel. This is mutually depending creation, not direct creation.

Saying "long-cultivation four great elements can create equal-flow form-sounds etc." means: namely long-cultivation form-sounds can express wholesome-unwholesome thought-karma, immediately called equal-flow form-sounds. Hence these equal-flow form-sounds are created from long-cultivation great elements. The remainder can be known.

Those equal-flow four great elements can create retribution long-cultivation forms etc.: like food-drink essence being equal-flow creating created. According to this food-drink, not merely able to produce long-cultivation form-sounds etc., but also causing retribution root-objects to flourish. Hence this food-drink's equal-flow four great elements serve as distant basis, causing long-cultivation, retribution etc. to either arise or excel. Using this mutual creation as example, remaining mutual arising can be known by analogy.

Now for marking and explaining these three categories' separate creation and mutual creation meanings, hence saying "accordingly explaining that all great elements create all

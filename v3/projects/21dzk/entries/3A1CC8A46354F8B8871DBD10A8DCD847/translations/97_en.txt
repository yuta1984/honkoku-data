Thus the question arises. This is because the Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā, fascicle 127, says: "Question: Does one set of four great elements create only one subtle particle of derived matter, or can it create many? If it creates only one, how does it not become a case of four causes producing one effect? Many causes with few effects - this principle should not be so. If it can create many, then with one set of four great elements, the derived matter would have many subtle particles. How could there be mutual succession without having concrete causes?" [Above treatise text] Explanation: The extensive answer to this question is as broadly explained there. Now borrowing that text to raise questions about the Mahāyāna doctrine of one-to-many creative relationships.

From "answering through mutual dependence" to "hence called creating." This is the chapter master depending on texts from the Nirṇayasaṃgraha to prove his own doctrine. In the present Mahāyāna school, mutual dependence and existence is called creating - it does not necessarily require subtle particles to dwell separately. Hence in one thing there are many great elements, and in aggregations of many things there is only one great element, yet all can mutually create each other. From this we should know: one set of four great elements creating one derived form, many sets of four great elements creating one derived form, also many sets of four great elements creating many derived forms, and one set of four great elements creating many derived forms - all these are theoretically unobstructed. The reason for this is that mutual dependence and existence is called creating. How can we know that mutual dependence and existence is called creating? "The Nirṇayasaṃgraha explains, etc." - this quotes text as proof. This is text from Yogācārabhūmi fascicle 54, Nirṇayasaṃgraha section, Five-Consciousness-Body Corresponding Ground, Mind Ground. Hence that text says: "Further, when the form aggregate arises, who is first? According to that location, depending on this place do the remaining forms function? You should know: the great elements first occupy locations, then the remaining derived forms depend on this place to function."

[Above treatise text] The chapter master's Yogācāra commentary explains this text: "This depends on the supported-supporter door. When karma-birth attracts reward, great elements arise as supporters, hence simultaneously there are derived forms. Because derived forms are supporters. Hence the remaining derived forms depend on this place to function. Not at different times." [Above commentary text] Now in this chapter, taking the meaning and quoting text. In the Nirṇayasaṃgraha it says "later the remaining derived forms depend on this place to function," and in this chapter it says "later derived forms arise" - their meaning is the same.

From "sun-disk light, etc." to "hence all can be obtained." This reveals the meaning of one-to-many mutual creation. Sun-disk light, etc. - the sun-disk is fifty-one yojanas. The light arising from it has immeasurable extent. These light-forms are small great elements creating many derived forms. Simultaneous-cause sounds, etc. - Abhidharmakośa fascicle 1 says: "Some sounds have both appropriated and unappropriated great elements as causes, like sounds produced by the combination of hand and drum." [Above treatise text] Abhidharmāsamuccaya fascicle 1 says: "Simultaneous-cause sounds are sounds like hand-drum, etc." [Above treatise text] Explanation: Dharma Master Jun says: "Simultaneous-cause means internal and external two types of great elements mutually serving as conditions, properly producing sounds, hence called simultaneous-cause sounds. But as the Abhidharmakośa objects: Just as we don't permit one visible form subtle particle to be created by two great elements, sounds should also be thus. How can sounds produced by two great elements be called simultaneous-cause sounds?" Explanation: Like the sound in the hand and the four great elements in the drum both serving as conditions, assisting this sound in the hand. Because of the conditions of internal and external great elements, it properly arises, hence called simultaneous-cause sound. The four great elements in the drum properly create the sound in the drum, with the four great elements in the hand serving as conditional assistance. Hence this sound in the drum

has two causes and conditions and properly arises, hence called simultaneous-cause sound. Extensively as explained in that master's Abhidharmāsamuccaya commentary. Since there are no subtle particles, hence all can be obtained - in Sarvāstivāda, etc., one set of four great elements together can create one derived form subtle particle. That school doesn't permit one visible form subtle particle to be created by two great elements. The reason for this is that subtle particles have substantial nature with distinct names. In the present Mahāyāna, there are never subtle particles. If arising from seeds, they necessarily arise as aggregates. Because they mutually depend without mutual obstruction, all can create. Regarding this great-element-creating doctrine, various categorical analyses are found in Yogācārabhūmi fascicles 3, 54, 64, 65, 66; Prakaranāryavāca fascicles 2, 5; Abhidharmāsamuccaya fascicles 1, 6; Abhidharmakośa fascicle 1; Abhidharmahṛdaya fascicle 1; Jñānaprasthāna fascicles 13, 14; Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā fascicles 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132.

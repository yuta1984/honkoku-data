Question: If the sudden arising of the five consciousnesses is only one moment, why does Yogācāra volume fifty-two say "If these six consciousnesses serve as the immediately antecedent condition for those six consciousnesses, etc."? Answer: That speaks about the uniform-flow five consciousnesses, not about sudden arising, so there is no contradiction.

Regarding the text "According to one explanation about mental consciousness... the previous explanation is good." This describes different explanations.

Regarding the text "Because initially falling into objects... because it is defiled-pure mind." Below this clarifies that the latter four minds continue for multiple moments. "Because initially falling into objects, afterwards it is not sudden arising" means: initially falling into objects is called sudden arising, and from the second moment onward, it necessarily pursues the previous or immediately determines, so it says "afterwards it is not sudden arising." "Determining lasts multiple moments, etc." means: initial seeking does not immediately give rise to determining, and initial determining cannot immediately give rise to defiled-pure. Therefore seeking and determining extend through multiple moment continuation.

Regarding the text "Hearing sound in concentration... also arises for multiple moments." This clarifies the multiple moment continuation of seeking. "Hearing sound in concentration, etc." proves the multiple moment continuation of seeking mind. This refers to what is explained at the end of the Samādhipāda in Yogācāra volume sixty-three. It describes a practitioner who, when encountering the condition of sound, emerges from concentration.

The ear-consciousness encountering sound turns together with the mental consciousness corresponding to concentration, hearing the sound, etc. Now pointing to that text, it says "hearing sound in concentration." I think that when the treatise says "practitioner," it is like Mahāmaudgalyāyana who, while sitting in the concentration of nothingness beside the monkey pool, heard the roaring of elephants and the playful sounds of monkeys and immediately emerged from concentration. Now pointing to this person, it says "practitioner." According to the Sarvāstivāda school, one hears after emerging from concentration. Therefore the Jñānaprasthāna treatise volume nineteen says: As explained, the Venerable Mahā-

maudgalyāyana said: "Friend, I myself remember that while dwelling in the concentration of nothingness, I heard the sounds of many dragon-elephants roaring, etc. beside the Mandākinī pool." Did that venerable one hear while in concentration, or did he emerge from concentration? Answer: He emerged from concentration and heard. Not while in concentration. (Above is the treatise text) In Mahāyāna, one emerges after hearing. If one does not hear first, how does one emerge from concentration? Question: Does mental consciousness in concentration only objectify the object of concentration, or does it also objectify sound objects? Answer: It generally objectifies both objects. As the Prakaraṇāryavāca treatise says:

Also, when dwelling in concentration and apprehending external sounds, know that apprehension occurs through two kinds. First, through mental consciousness that discriminates the object-sphere of concentration and various object-spheres. Second, through ear-consciousness arising together with this. Details follow that explanation. Question: How can the body in formless concentration objectify objects like sounds in the desire realm? Answer: Yogācāra volume sixty-five and others explain that śrāvakas of vast wisdom, both learners and non-learners, objectify dharmas of the three realms with formless realm mind. Therefore there is no contradiction. "Having already attained autonomy, etc." proves that determining mind extends through multiple moments. This is text from volume four of Vijñaptimātratā.

Regarding the text "Regarding defiled-pure mind... because it is uniform flow." This clarifies that defiled-pure of the five consciousnesses continues for multiple moments, while defiled-pure of mental consciousness is only one moment. In defiled-pure mind, if arising after the five consciousnesses, it also extends through continuation. When the five consciousnesses have not yet arisen, it cannot be called uniform flow. First objectifying the past, defiled-pure mind arises; later when objectifying similar objects, uniform flow finally arises. Because it is difficult to arise, in principle it extends through continuation. "This depends on making the five consciousnesses uniform-flow mind" means: depending on the defiled-pure mind of the five consciousnesses, it draws forth and produces its own uniform-flow mind. "If mental consciousness uniform flow, etc." means: if it is the uniform-flow mind of independently arising mental consciousness,

defiled-pure is only one moment. From the next second moment onward, it immediately belongs to uniform flow.

Regarding the text "Only uniform-flow mind... because it explains sudden arising." The intention of the first explanation: Yogācāra volume three says: "Also, after one moment of the five consciousnesses arises, mental consciousness necessarily arises immediately afterward. When it says 'five consciousnesses,'" it is not only sudden arising. Because the text does not make distinctions. Therefore it is known that uniform flow of the five consciousnesses is also only one moment. Now pointing to that text, it says "as the previously cited explanation." The intention of the second explanation: when the treatise says "one moment of the five consciousnesses," it only explains sudden arising and does not explain uniform flow. The uniform flow of the five consciousnesses continues for multiple moments. If not so, it would contradict the above text saying "uniform-flow eye-consciousness turns in good and bad."

Regarding the text "Pravicaya also explains... in principle necessarily continues." This cites proof to clarify that uniform-flow mind extends through multiple moments. "Pravicaya also explains, etc." refers to Yogācāra Pravicaya volume fifty-two text. "Vijñaptimātratā also says, etc." is volume four text. The intention in citing the first text: if it were one moment, what immediately antecedent condition would there be? The intention in citing the latter text: because objects are strong and superior, they extend through multiple moments. "Playful and forgetful gods, etc." equals wrathful gods - these are the upper four gods of the desire realm. There are no separate locations. However, Vibhāṣā volume one hundred ninety-nine has two explanations. One says they dwell on the levels of Mount Meru. The other says they are the thirty-three gods. These good and evil people have strong conditions that are hard to abandon, so the five consciousness-bodies definitely have continuation. Explaining "only one moment" depends on sudden arising, so there is no contradiction.

Regarding the text "Therefore the present correct view... all extend through multiple moments." "Sudden arising is mostly only one moment, etc." Question: The previous text says "If independently arising mental consciousness, if mental consciousness together with the five, the sudden arising mind stage is only one moment."

How does it now say "sudden arising is mostly only one moment"? Since it says "mostly," by analogy it is known that a little extends through multiple moments. Answer: According to tradition, based on this text, Master Ji's intention that sudden arising also extends through multiple moments is incorrect. Calling sudden arising of the five consciousnesses and others "one moment" takes the totality of many arising and ceasing as one moment. The Benevolent King Sutra says: "Sixty moments make one thought. One moment has nine hundred arisings and ceasings."

It should be known that the word "moment" also refers generally to many arisings and ceasings. From this it should be known that "mostly" means extremely many. That is, the time that sudden mind experiences is extremely long, extending through sixty moments. Therefore it says "mostly." "Only one thought" is extremely few, extending through one or two arisings and ceasings. By this meaning, Yogācāra and others say "one moment, etc." "Or all extending through multiple thoughts" - when it says "multiple thoughts," it means many arisings and ceasings.

Regarding the text "The fifth, disturbed and undisturbed... disturbed mind and undisturbed." When it says "self and others, etc.," taking the five consciousnesses: eye-consciousness is called self, ear-consciousness and others are called others. Question: Why is there "self disturbed, mind undisturbed" and "others disturbed, mind undisturbed," and there is "others disturbed, self undisturbed," but no "self and others undisturbed"? Answer: "Others disturbed, mind undisturbed" corresponds to "others disturbed, self undisturbed." Also "self disturbed, others undisturbed" corresponds to "self disturbed, mind undisturbed." Therefore they are not explained separately.

Regarding the text "Self and others both undisturbed... therefore obtaining defiled-pure." "Only through drawing forth" and below is the chapter master's text. "And because serving as cause, defiled-pure dharmas arise, etc." - the arising of defiled-pure mind arises through two causes. First through discrimination, second through what was previously drawn. When it says "discrimination," it refers to now discriminating objects not yet obtained. "Previously drawn" refers to objects previously already obtained that are now familiar. Mental consciousness defiled-pure is endowed with both

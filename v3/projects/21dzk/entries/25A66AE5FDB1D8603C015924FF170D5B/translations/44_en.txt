Next, the stage of contemplating the three characteristics is all inference. [Contemplating the three characteristics of smoke, contemplating the three characteristics of production]
Later, the stage of understanding the thesis is all inference. [Understanding the existence of fire, understanding impermanence]
[End of indentation]

Regarding these two stages: the previous two stages are both causal stages. Because they should produce the third stage. The latter stage is immediately the resultant stage. Because one has already obtained the decisive cognition of inference. Among the previous two stages, the first stage is the remote cause of the third stage. Because it cannot yet produce the cognitive result of inference. Because it should eventually lead to it. The second stage is the proximate cause of the third. What can produce the third is the power of contemplating the cause. Because it directly produces it. The previous two stages are not the proper substance of inference. The third is proper inference. However, because causes follow results, the previous two stages should also be called inference.

The question "saying current perception etc." questions direct perception arising from direct perception.

The question "saying inference etc." questions inference perhaps arising from inference.

"There is Fuqin etc." - Dao says: This is text from the lower volume of Ximing's commentary.

"This direct and inferential cognition etc." - Dao says: This is text from the commentary master below.

"Or again overturning this, avoiding the previous two explanations" - "Or again overturning this" - the marginal notes say: Zhou says: Taking the thought remembering causes as instrumental cause, taking direct and inferential cognition as agent [etc.]. This corresponds to Ximing's explanation [above marginal notes]. Avoiding the previous two explanations - the marginal notes say: Bei says: When taking the original commentary's explanation as correct doctrine, avoiding Ximing's theory. When taking Ximing's theory as correct doctrine, avoiding the original commentary's explanation [etc.]. Also says: Zhou says: ○Some versions say: following the previous two explanations [etc.]. Where Ximing's explanation is, Dao says: This

[Lower Section]

contradicts the Vijñānavāda treatise [etc.]. After stating the two explanations, the continued commentary says: However, the previous explanation is correct [etc.]. Therefore should one depend on the original commentary's explanation?

"Questioning in Nyāyamukha etc." - within this there are two questions. The first question's meaning questions the contradiction between two treatises. That is, in Nyāyamukha, the direct perception object of smoke as cause and the cognition relating to smoke are both called direct perception. The inferential object of the constructed cause and the cognition relating to the constructed are both called inference. Therefore that treatise has both direct and inferential comprehending object-cognition. In this treatise, direct perception only takes cognition, not comprehending objects. Inference also only takes cognition, not comprehending objects, therefore contradicting. Therefore questioning this. The latter question's meaning questions Nyāyamukha. This question, attached to the above saying "arising from direct perception etc." - does comprehending mind-object call it direct perception etc.? Or does that treatise's meaning make remote and proximate causes follow results in being called inference? How can one know that that treatise's meaning is like this?

"Answering Nyāyamukha etc." - following the questions there are again two answers. The first answer answers the second question, the latter answer answers the first question [seen]. The meaning of answering the second question is to cite that treatise's detailed explanation that inference causes are also called inference and direct perception objects are also called direct perception, to remove doubt. That is, in that treatise's place explaining inference, saying "arising from direct perception etc.," calling inference's causal objects and cognitions inference, but not yet clarifying that cognitive results are called inference. In the place explaining direct perception, resultant cognition is called direct perception, but not yet clarifying that those direct causal objects like smoke etc. are called direct perception. However, the presently cited text mutually harmonizes this. In this place explaining inference, its inferential results should also be called inference. In that place explaining direct perception, its direct causal

objects should also be called direct perception - this is the text that explains this. Therefore it can remove the previous doubt. The meaning of answering the first question is: Nyāyamukha clarifies remote and proximate causes, therefore direct and inferential each comprehend objects. This treatise clarifies the proper substance of the two cognitions, therefore only taking resultant cognition, not comprehending objects.

That is, there are objections saying ○ or Sarvāstivāda etc. objections ○ or non-Buddhist etc. assertions ○

The Mingdeng Commentary says: In this anticipated objection, there are altogether three objections. First is the common objection of Hīnayāna and non-Buddhists, next is the Hīnayāna Sarvāstivāda objection, later is various non-Buddhist objections [etc.].

"Immediately jar-nature's sameness-difference" - inquiring: What is the meaning of using sameness-difference categorical meaning to call it jar-nature? If saying provisionally pointing to the sameness-difference nature on jars, then among the broad sameness-difference nature, by what distinct cause does one uniquely point to sameness-difference on jars? Not being limited to jar sameness-difference, generally this should be pseudo-direct perception objects.

Answer: Considering the Mingdeng Commentary's meaning, the non-Buddhist doctrines presently raised all provisionally discuss regarding one jar. The word "etc." below jar then comprehends the remainder outside jars [seen]. Therefore the Lamp Commentary says ○ Conventional [dharmas] are numerous. Provisionally speaking about the two theories with superior number. ○ "Jars etc." explains Vaiśeṣika's substance categorical meanings and Sāṅkhya's five subtle elements. Among substance categories, there are altogether nine dharmas. ○ Presently saying "jar" means: the four elements' constantly scattered subtle atoms, combining in pairs, therefore producing offspring etc., forming □ and jars etc. Including bowls and urns, and including equally usable things obtained by eye's direct perception. ○ The four elements are

substance. Through constant subtlety producing offspring etc.'s coarse characteristics and after, then having jar characteristics. On jars then having eight [kinds of] form, fragrance, taste, touch (in the teaching treatise there are five subtle elements) four dusts. Taking these as quality characteristics. ○ Next "number etc." - among quality categorical meanings there are twenty-four qualities. That is number-quantity, unity-difference, conjunction-disjunction etc. Raising number and saying etc. ○ If there is one jar, the eye sees it as one. If there are two jars, the eye sees them as two. Therefore saying (considering pseudo-direct perception as direct perception) direct perception. Next raising etc. - ○ Raising the five actions of lowering, extending, going etc. below. When someone raises their hand, the eye sees that raising. ○ Next "existence-nature" is the fourth great existence category. ○ This nature exists in jars, the eye sees it as existing. ○ Next "jar-nature" is the fifth sameness-difference categorical meaning. ○ Jars are the same as jars while different from bowls etc. Next saying "etc." - there are naturally two explanations. First, raising that jar-nature, including bowls etc. That conjunction category - for instance, like four people conjoining to form a saṅgha. Within the saṅgha body, there is conjunction-nature. Though immediately substantially existing, separated from the four people, one cannot see it separately. Due to this, it is not obtained by direct perception. ○ Therefore excluding the conjunction category. The second explanation says: including the sixth conjunction categorical meaning. Direct perception sees when four people gather together versus when not gathering, their characteristics are not the same. ○ Therefore also direct perception [etc.].

"This explanation exhausts principle, the previous explanation being limited" - also "but discrimination" and below is the latter explanation. Previously is the former explanation. That former explanation only takes non-attachment non-cognition to call pseudo-direct perception. Therefore saying "the previous explanation is limited." That latter explanation adds attached mind non-cognition, therefore saying "this explanation exhausts principle."

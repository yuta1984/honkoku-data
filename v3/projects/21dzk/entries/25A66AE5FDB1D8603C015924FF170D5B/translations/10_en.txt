It is complete non-accomplishment. Since there is now this aspect of "non," wanting to distinguish it, conversely just saying "is," saying "there is existence." Regarding such partial sentences and general-particular: Partial sentences means partially subject non-accomplished predicate accomplished, partially predicate non-accomplished subject accomplished - since there are four sentences in two biases, it is called "partial sentences." General-particular means complete and partial. That "mutual non-accomplishment complete" combines subject-predicate non-accomplishment, therefore called "mutual non-accomplishment." It is not establisher-opponent mutually opposing non-accomplishment. This is in contrast to previous partial non-accomplishment, therefore called "mutual non-accomplishment." "Complete" distinguishes self-partial predicate non-accomplishment, other-partial subject non-accomplishment, etc. Now, regarding complete-partial faults, wanting to make various sentences of predicate-subject mutual non-accomplishment, therefore saying "complete."

From "there is self-predicate non-accomplishment other-subject" to "there is mutual predicate non-accomplishment mutual-non-subject," there are eight sentences total. This is two-stage four sentences. At the end of one sentence among these various sentences, "other-subject," "self-subject," "mutual-non-subject" etc. should each have the word "non-accomplishment." However, fearing verbosity, expressing that all say "non-accomplishment," the final words are abbreviated. That is, the first sentence specifically has "self-predicate non-accomplishment other-subject non-accomplishment." Up to the eighth sentence: "mutual predicate non-accomplishment mutual-non-subject non-accomplishment." Also, among these various sentences, saying "mutual" is always self-other opposing mutual. Not predicate-subject mutual.

"Among the two four-sentences, the previous seven sentences are all this fault, the eighth sentence is previous partial fault." Discussing sentence number: predicate-subject eight sentences, subject-predicate eight sentences. Each side has two sets of

[Lower Section]
four sentences, therefore should say "among twenty-eight sentences," but discussing actual essence, predicate-primary and subject-primary two sides are identical. Only their difference is before-after, up-down distinction. Therefore combining the two eight-sentences calls them "two four-sentences." This principle is in the text below. The text says: "Although there are four in total, essence has only two. Later is immediately former, having no further difference, therefore only named two four-sentences" [etc.]. "The previous seven sentences are all this fault" means among eight sentences, the previous seven are all dharma-dharmin mutual non-accomplishment sentences. "The eighth sentence" etc. means the eighth sentence is predicate-subject either-one non-accomplished, either-one not non-accomplished sentence, therefore should entirely be within the above partial sentences. That is, within predicate non-accomplishment as primary, the eighth sentence above of subject definitely accomplished predicate non-accomplished sentence is also thus. Should be in the text. Within subject non-accomplishment as primary, the eighth sentence above of predicate definitely accomplished also within subject [...] has mutual non-accomplishment sentences. "There is self mutual non-accomplishment [...] there is mutual-non self-other mutual non-accomplishment" expresses having the fifth four-sentences among five types of four-sentences. Now this "mutual" word is predicate-subject opposing mutual. Not the usual self-other opposing mutual. But up to the fourth sentence, "self-other mutual" - self-other differs from the above only-self only-other. Now combining self-other, therefore saying "self-other." However, that mutual is still like the previous predicate-subject mutual.

"Again there are five sentences [five types four-sentences], totaling ten sentences [ten types four-sentences]"

"Two types of self-nature and two differentiations." Two types of self-nature means dharma-dharmin two verbal expressions. Two

differentiations means dharma-dharmin two mental intentions. This is the meaning of Eup's Record cited in Collected Records.

"Only distinguishing three" means predicate non-accomplishment, subject non-accomplishment, mutual non-accomplishment.

"Also like example words" etc. cites analogy. Collected Records says: Eup says: "Manifesting cause similar class" immediately distinguishes means-of-proof non-accomplishment in examples. "Definitely having nature" distinguishes what-is-established non-accomplishment. Combining these two sentences distinguishes mutual non-accomplishment. There are five faults in similar examples, but only distinguishing three, not distinguishing the other two. This also distinguishes three, to make the analogy the same [etc.]. "Not distinguishing synthesis-conclusion" means not distinguishing no-synthesis inverted-synthesis.

The general principle of four meaning-differences for why thesis says "extremely accomplished" while cause-example do not say "extremely accomplished."
[End indentation]

First meaning: Dependent-basis mutual contrast. Within thesis there are extreme and non-extreme, distinguishing non-extreme to say extreme. In cause-example, both dependent and basis are extremely accomplished, having no non-extreme to distinguish. Therefore not saying extreme [meaning].

[Indented one character]
Cause's basis is immediately thesis's dharmin. Dependent is immediately cause essence. Example's basis is pot etc. Dependent is impermanence, produced, etc. That is, example essence.
[End indentation]

Second meaning: What-is-established means-of-establishment mutual contrast. Thesis as what-is-established necessarily can have dispute, therefore can have something to distinguish. Places "extremely accomplished" words. Cause-example as means-of-establishment necessarily should be mutually accepted, cannot have something to distinguish. Therefore not placing "extremely accomplished" words [meaning].

Third meaning: Accomplished non-accomplished mutual contrast. Thesis is non-accomplished thing, therefore can have oversight, therefore requires extremely-accomplished distinction. Cause-example are accomplished things, therefore can have no oversight, therefore do not require extremely-accomplished distinction. However [考note: Below "而" possibly missing "与字"] this differs from the second meaning. The second meaning compares thesis with cause-example - cause-example are things that establish

[Lower Section]
thesis, definitely should be mutually accepted. Thesis is thing established by them, definitely can have dispute [meaning]. This third directly sees thesis as non-accomplished thing, cause-example as accomplished things.

Fourth meaning: True-fallacious mutual contrast. Using true to distinguish fallacious. Thesis and cause-example have differences, therefore presence-absence of "extremely accomplished" words differs [meaning]. That is, regarding fallacious three components, thesis non-accomplishment is all self-other non-extremely-accomplished meaning. Not meaning of non-establishment. Cause-example non-accomplishment are all only meanings of non-accomplished words. Partially having self-other non-extreme meaning, included within non-establishment. Therefore regarding fallacious cause-example, non-establishment meaning is broadest, non-extreme meaning is partial. Now following the broad, therefore distinguishing it. True cause-example do not place "extremely accomplished" words. Not because wanting to distinguish non-extreme. But regarding fallacious thesis, that non-accomplished is all definitely only self-other non-extreme meaning. Therefore distinguishing it. True thesis places "extremely accomplished" words. Now non-establishment means cause not establishing thesis, example not establishing cause, etc. Non-extreme means meaning of establisher-opponent not extremely accomplishing.

Question: Within cause-example non-accomplishment, also having non-extreme - what is the word's meaning?
Answer: For example, like mutual non-accomplishment, there is no-essence mutual, there is having-essence mutual. No-essence mutual: when Sāṃkhya teacher establishes to Buddhist disciple "sound is permanent, because included in quality category," this cause has no establisher, no opponent. Sāṃkhya and Buddhist disciples both do not establish quality category, therefore named no-essence mutual. This takes self-other non-extremely-accomplished as fault, named mutual non-accomplishment fault. Having-essence mutual: like establishing "sound is permanent, because of eye-visible nature," only the eye-visible cause, establish-

"contradiction" means uncertainty and contradiction. That is, Wengui's meaning is that this inference has only uncertainty and contradicting the particular characteristics of the subject, and there is no one-sided non-establishment [so to speak].

"This inference is also not equal [...] therefore what is cited is incorrect" - the commentary master correctly refutes Wengui. The meaning is: Wengui uses this inference having no one-sided non-establishment as a model example. So who says this? Generally raising the various faults of one-sided non-establishment etc. that this inference has. This inference is originally like this. What makes it an example? - this is mockery. Namely: subject non-establishment [against the no-space theory], one-sided non-establishment, basis non-establishment, shared uncertainty [above is the scope of the main commentary], contradicting particular characteristics of the subject [the continued commentary adds this].

[One character indent]
Question: The opponent of this inference is originally Mahāyāna. This is the scope of Master Gui's position. But why change the opponent to become a no-space theorist and consider subject non-establishment?

Answer: The Ming Deng Commentary says: "First, the subject non-establishment fault means: even if establishing the inference 'empty space is permanent' etc. against Mahāyāna, following the no-space theory, since it does not permit real space, there is the fault of subject non-establishment" [etc.]

Question: What are the methods of one-sided non-establishment, uncertainty, and contradicting particular characteristics of the subject?

Answer: The Ming Deng Commentary says: "The second one-sided non-establishment means: because Mahāyāna does not permit the unmade-ness reason that possesses negation-affirmation, there is the fault of other one-sided non-establishment. ○ The fourth uncertainty fault means: Is it that like cessation through discrimination, possessing negation-affirmation, the substance being unmade, therefore space is permanent? Or like rabbit horns, lacking negation-affirmation, the substance being unmade, therefore space is not permanent? When they establish space as permanent it possesses negation-affirmation, but rabbit horns lack

affirmation. Necessarily contradicting particular characteristics of the subject means: because they establish a separate substance apart from suchness as space, seeking the implied meaning and challenging the explicit statement, saying: 'Empty space is not empty space, because of being unmade, like cessation through discrimination.' Since they seek the implied separate space apart from suchness and do not add words, challenging the explicit statement, it becomes contradicting particular characteristics of the subject. The meaning of establishing a separate substance apart from suchness is space, which both sides permit. Cessation through discrimination is unconditioned and is not empty space. Space is what is disputed, therefore it becomes contradiction" [etc.]

Also, "the example of cessation through discrimination is permanent" etc. is one interpretation. Above, since they use the unmade-ness reason, before the establisher there is negation-affirmation, before the opponent there is only negation - Master Wengui holds this position, and permits challenging this. This interpretation does not permit Master Gui's position. This reason is permitted by both establisher and opponent to have negation-affirmation, and one cannot say that before the opponent there is only negation. Since this reason is already permitted by both establisher and opponent to possess negation-affirmation, that inference has no one-sided non-establishment. The current inference "sound is permanent because of non-obstruction like empty space" - because its example before the opponent has only negation, this has probans non-establishment. What is cited as example-evidence makes its function futile [so to speak]. The repeated meaning is: the first and last interpretations, regarding Master Gui's position, mutually have the two aspects of permission and non-permission. The first interpretation permits only negation before the opponent but does not permit there being no one-sided non-establishment. The last interpretation permits there being no one-sided non-establishment but does not permit only negation before the opponent. Now the Ming Deng Commentary calls this second interpretation the fault of cited uselessness. Therefore the Deng Commentary says: "Sixth, cited uselessness means: also

one interpretation says: because establisher and opponent both permit that all three members possess negation-affirmation, the cited inference wastes its effort" [etc.]

Question: What does it mean that before the opponent Mahāyāna there is negation-affirmation? Is there an affirmed substance in empty space before Mahāyāna?

Answer: I privately consider: it is not that the opponent Mahāyāna permits empty space to have affirmed substance like the establisher Hīnayāna does. Now, saying there is negation-affirmation means: that empty space is non-existent therefore unmade - this is negation. That the affirmation of unmade-ness is the place where material dharmas are absent - this is affirmation. Should it be understood like this?

"Suppose if defending by saying [...] however there is refutation saying" etc. - this is Master Jingyan refuting the Sound school defense that Master Gui narrated. The meaning of the defense is stated in the Yi Record cited in marginal notes: "This is precisely the previous defense" [etc.] The previous defense refers to Master Gui's narration of the Sound school defense cited at the beginning of the volume. The text "Some say the Sound school possesses negation-affirmation" etc. is this. Its meaning is as above. The commentary master, wanting to refute Master Jingyan's refutation, cites his refutation and what is refuted. Master Jingyan's refutation meaning is easy to know from the text. Now taking "however there is refutation saying" as Master Jingyan is according to the marginal notes text. The marginal notes say: Yi says: this Master Jingyan [etc.] However, the Ming Deng Commentary says: "'However there is refutation saying' etc. - some people say this narrates Master Jingyan's explanation, but this is not yet clear. Examining that master's commentary, there is no such matter at all. It may also be worth examining other commentaries etc." [etc.]

The Continued Commentary says: "The Nyāyamukha says: 'The former is negation and expression, the latter only stops observation.' Taking only negation alike therefore violates the teaching" [etc.] The Ming Deng Commentary says: "○ That is, the former positive example is negation and expression, expression meaning affirmation" [etc.] Also the same commentary says: "Question ○ The old commentary (main commentary) originally says: 'The Nyāyamukha says: If a dharma has negation-affirmation, one cannot only take negation without taking affirmation.' In the Nyāyamukha there is no such text at all. That treatise only says 'the former is negation-expression, the latter only stops observation.' Only this text exists. The old commentary only takes the meaning of this text, hiding the text and manifesting the meaning. Therefore it is not false citation. 'If a dharma has negation-affirmation' means 'the former is negation-expression'" etc. [etc.]

[Lower Section]

"This challenge is also incorrect [...] because it makes a definitive inference" - the commentary master correctly refutes Master Jingyan's refutation of the Sound school defense. Outsiders should not use the Nyāyamukha as definitive inference [so to speak]. Now saying "this treatise" [...] "therefore this is an example fault" - after the commentary master considers Master Jingyan's refutation incorrect, he himself challenges the Sound school defense and establishes that the treatise has no both non-establishment. The Continued Commentary says: "Now the explanation says: ○ [Like the main commentary] Therefore this is an example fault. If only taking negation, it would violate logical error. Because thesis, reason, and example all have meaning. Or it may violate the original Hetuvidyā treatise composed by Akṣapāda that is commonly accepted in the world, therefore it can be called violating the cause" [etc.] The Ming Deng Commentary says: "This is precisely the commentary master further presenting two faults: violating reason and teaching. ○ This refutation means: the Sound school's original doctrine is that sound is permanent and non-obstructed, possessing negation-affirmation. The example only takes negation. In this treatise of the Heavenly Master, if it says like space against the no-space theory there is no both non-establishment, discussing that empty space lacks both establishments, this is according to their original doctrine. If their derivative doctrine follows verbal changes, it should be refuted accordingly. If only taking

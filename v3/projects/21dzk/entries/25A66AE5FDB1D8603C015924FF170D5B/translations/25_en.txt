Regarding "the establishing reason cannot accomplish the thesis, or what is originally not a reason cannot accomplish the meaning of reason, called inconclusive": Now these two meanings can both establish four inconclusives. The meaning of the first interpretation is that all four inconclusives do not accomplish the meaning of the thesis. That is, inconclusive reasons. The meaning of the second interpretation is that all four inconclusives have the meaning that the reason-essence itself is inconclusive. That is, inconclusive即reason. The Myōtō Commentary cites the Abbreviation, and its meaning is like this.

Regarding "although there are three characteristics of reasons [through] having no special superior function, called inconclusive": This addresses a hidden objection. The hidden objection says: If we call it inconclusive because of the meaning of not accomplishing the thesis and the meaning of the reason-essence itself being inconclusive, then the remaining indefinite and contradictory could also have these two meanings. They could also be called inconclusive [so to speak]. Addressing this difficulty: Although that meaning is so, indefinite, contradictory, and inconclusive all have their respective reasons for being given different names. The meaning is as above. If the latter two characteristics are both present, they are both indefinite. The following can be understood by analogy. This is the sequential correspondence of the six indefinites. If the latter two characteristics are same-absent, different-pervasive, different-partial, same-absent, etc., they are the four contradictories. The Collected Records cite the Later Records with two interpretations. The first interpretation abandons all four contradictories. The second interpretation refers to four and six among the nine sentences. Taking the former interpretation as correct. However, the commentary annotation saying to separately assign same-absent and different-pervasive to dharma-svabhāva, and separately assign different-partial and same-absent to the latter three contradictories, does not grasp the meaning. This should be deliberated upon later. Regarding "if the reason itself is inconclusive [through] therefore it should be as explained here": This explains the first meaning of inconclusive in reverse. The meaning of being unable to accomplish the thesis should definitely be possessed [so to speak].

Regarding "or explaining logically [through] there is also no problem with the principle of self-inconclusive": This explains the second meaning of inconclusive in reverse.

[Lower Section]

The meaning of reason-essence being inconclusive should also definitely be possessed [so to speak]. Therefore, combining these two meanings, both should be possessed [as seen].

There are four inconclusives, etc. below

Regarding "negative reason, depending on subject, subject extends to existence and non-existence, etc.": Negative reason is a blocking reason. Like saying "because it is not created." By analogy, positive reason is an affirming reason. Like saying "because of the nature of being created." Having a subject means taking an accepted dharma-essence as the subject. Not having a subject means taking an unaccepted dharma-essence as the subject.

Like establishing sound as impermanent, etc. below

Regarding "now the eye-perception reason [through] not only cannot accomplish the thesis but also cannot accomplish the meaning of reason": Inquiring: This reason, when facing the reason-essence, is not inconclusive. Simply saying "eye-perception," both parties accept it. The reason it now becomes a both-commonly-inconclusive reason is simply that it is not a characteristic of the subject, so it cannot accomplish the thesis—this is one meaning. However, now saying "also cannot accomplish the meaning of reason itself"—what is this meaning? Answer: Generally, what does not accomplish the reason-essence [examination: probably missing the character "not" after "essence"] is not a reason at all. Already not being a reason, how could it not be that the reason-essence is inconclusive? If so, who would say that generally raising "eye-perception" is not permitted? Now raising it as a characteristic of sound, therefore it completely fails to be a reason. This is the meaning of the reason-essence itself being inconclusive. Such a reason also cannot accomplish the established thesis, so it also takes the meaning of being unable to accomplish the thesis as fundamental. Therefore, seeing this reason as absent from the thesis and seeing it as not accomplishing the thesis are two different sides. The commentary's meaning is like this.

[Upper Section]

Regarding "the treatise's eye-perception reason [through] establishing all meanings like sound's freedom from corruption are all faults, etc.": Raising sound as the subject, taking eye-perception as the reason, whatever meaning one tries to establish, none can be accomplished. It is not limited to the single meaning of impermanence [so to speak]. Other meanings are like establishing "sound is free from corruption," etc. The word "etc." below "thesis" in the treatise text takes this "etc." [so to speak].

Because of the nature of being created, against the sound-manifestation school below [At the place of subject-inconclusive, taking opposition to the no-space school sentence to raise the opponent. Now it should also be so]

Regarding "the next sentence discusses the thesis": Inquiring: The next sentence is the sentence opposing the sound-manifestation school. Looking at the before and after of the treatise, doesn't this appear to discuss the thesis in one sentence? The thesis yields to the previous and is abbreviated. Therefore the commentary's next passage below says, "The thesis is the same as before, so only the reason is narrated [text]." This seems to invite contradiction. How so? Answer: When opposing the sound-manifestation school, establishing the thesis that sound is impermanent is inevitable. Therefore in that one sentence opposing the sound-manifestation school, that thesis is known. Therefore it says "the next sentence discusses the thesis." However, there is also no proper marking of the thesis. Therefore the text below says "therefore only narrating the reason, etc."

The question "there is also a transmitted interpretation, etc." refers to Wengui's interpretation. That master's commentary is the first. The meaning of this interpretation is that even depending on conditions for manifestation, it still wants to belong to arising. The Myōtō Commentary should be consulted.

Regarding "and partial sentences are all faults": Inquiring: If distinguishing words are placed, having no faults applies to both complete and partial. Why raise complete sentences and make partial sentences entirely faulty? Therefore, examining the partial four-sentence methodology quantities raised by the commentary, appropriately placing words of self-accepted or other-accepted

[Lower Section]

all seem to escape faults. The explanation is unclear. How so?

Answer: All partial sentences have two parts in their reasons—one part commonly accepted, one part not commonly accepted. That non-commonly-accepted part: on the proponent's side it doesn't hold, called self-either-one. On the opponent's side it doesn't hold, called other-either-one. However, if for self-partial-either-one we place other-accepted distinction, even the commonly accepted part of that partial becomes entirely related to other-accepted. If for other-partial-either-one we place self-accepted distinction, again even the commonly accepted part of that partial becomes entirely related to self-accepted. Therefore distinguishing words cannot be placed. This is unlike the case of entirely common reasons, where self-accepted words are placed to distinguish faults on the reason. This is because actual self-accepted dharmas exist within the reason. If we place self-calculated words, could there be self-accepted of partial self-accepted, and partial being self-accepted of commonly-accepted? The deliberation on Śūramgama's inference is as in the separate paper.

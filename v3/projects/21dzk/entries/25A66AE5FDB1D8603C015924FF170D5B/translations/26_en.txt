**Private Commentary on the Great Commentary of Hetuvidyā [End of Middle Volume]**

Regarding "concerning the nature of mist, etc." below

Regarding "the smoke seen there, etc. below, seemingly having actual fire, etc.": The Myōtō Commentary says: ○ Speaking logically, there is definitely fire in that mountain marsh. The mountain marsh having the characteristic of fire is the dharma in the thesis. This does not mean taking the fire-essence itself as the dharma in the thesis. ○ Establishing the thesis "there is actual fire," saying: There is fire in that place. Because smoke appears. Like in kitchens and other places. Already at that place, whether this is smoke or not smoke, both the proponent and opponent do not clearly know. ○ However, when the reason states "because there is manifest smoke," it takes the mountain marsh having visibly manifest smoke, not taking the smoke-essence itself as the reason-essence. ○ Question: Already saying "seemingly having actual fire." There is also doubt about fire. Why is there no hesitant inconclusive in the thesis-faults? Answer: Master Bin says: Doubt about reasons has manifest characteristics. Doubt about the thesis has hidden characteristics. Hidden doubt must be accomplished through manifest doubt. Therefore the manifest is explained. Through this the hidden is known [etc.]. That commentary's later text also cites this interpretation by Master Bin. This interpretation is incorrect [so forth].

Regarding "isolated dharma, combined dharma [through] conforming to that": This concludes the hesitant faults of the three categories of thesis. Isolated dharma, combined dharma, both-common, either-one, complete, partial: this concludes hesitant non-establishment. Saying "because of contradiction": this concludes the hesitant self-contradictory statements. "Conforming to that": this concludes the hesitant mutual agreement. In concluding non-establishment, "isolated dharma" means only the predicate and only the subject. "Combined dharma" means both non-established. Each of these three has both-common complete/partial, self complete/partial, other complete/partial. Three × six = eighteen sentences.

I say: Examining according to the purport of the Myōtō Commentary, hesitant predicate-inconclusive means establishing the thesis saying: In places of smoke, etc., actual fire seems to exist. Hesitant subject means establishing the thesis saying: In smoke-like places, actual fire definitely exists. Hesitant both-inconclusive means establishing the thesis saying: In smoke-like places, actual fire seems to exist. Is it like this? This should be inquired into. While the above and below are not clear, this section has not yet settled.

Regarding "space is real existence, being the support of qualities," etc. below

"First, there are three both-common subject-inconclusives [through] because there is none in the self": Inquiring: These three sentences are all both-common subject-inconclusive. However, Sāṅkhya establishes the thesis of real self-existence, Vaiśeṣika establishes the thesis of self-action-reality. Furthermore, they are not both-common subject-inconclusive. They should be either-one subject-inconclusive. The self as support: before Buddhism it is considered non-existent, but before the proponent all consider it existent. Answer: The Collected Records, explaining doubts about no-essence complete sentences, cite Zhou saying: Question ○ [like the present inquiry] Answer: For now, discussing that both sides of the reason lack essence. The support is only partial. Now assisting in making this one sentence: Sarvāstivāda establishing against Mahāyāna that the self is real existence [etc.]. Through this purport the meaning can be grasped. "Now assisting in making this one sentence" below is easy to understand. The meaning of the first interpretation is: because there is no support on the opponent's side, it becomes subject-inconclusive. That the reason-essence has a subject—both proponent and opponent do not accept this, so it becomes both-common. Combined, it is called both-common subject-inconclusive. Inquiring: Why not make sentences of no-essence partial both-common subject-

inconclusive, not making it the fourth sentence, having only three sentences? Answer: The present inquiry is the questioning intent of the Yi Record. The interpretation says: If a no-essence reason is permitted to operate in one part of the thesis, then it is not no-essence. Therefore this sentence does not exist [so forth].

Regarding "Second, either-one subject-inconclusive [examination: 'wo' in the great commentary writes 'yū'] has six, etc.": Inquiring: Why not make both sentences of no-essence other-partial-either-one and no-essence self-partial-either-one? Answer: The commentary itself explains: If we permit a small part of self and other reasons to exist in the thesis, it is definitely not partial-either-one subject-inconclusive [so forth]. Does this text meaning match the Yi Record meaning presented above? "Definitely not partial, etc." means: definitely not no-essence partial-either-one subject-inconclusive [so to speak].

Regarding "if depending on ancient masters' and non-Buddhist hetuvidyā [through] the support extends to non-existence": Ancient masters and non-Buddhists only establish two inconclusives, not opening up four inconclusives. That is, only both-common inconclusive and either-one inconclusive. These two also include all other inconclusives. Namely, all both-common hesitant inconclusives and all both-common subject-inconclusives are included in both-common inconclusive. All either-one hesitant inconclusives and all either-one subject-inconclusives are included in either-one inconclusive. "Extending to doubt and certainty": this is the meaning. Doubt means hesitation. Certainty means support. "Support extending to non-existence": support means the subject. The subject is not necessarily existent. There are also cases where the subject that is the support of reasons is non-existent. Restating the meaning: the subject-support of reasons, whether both-common or either-one, is not necessarily existent. It also extends to non-existence [so to speak]. The intention is to reconcile subject-inconclusive, which is why this text appears. However, that both-common

inconclusive [through] combined total nine sentences: This explains including hesitation and support in the both-common inconclusive established by ancient masters. Namely both-common hesitant and both-common subject-dependent. "Combined total nine sentences": both-common inconclusive has four sentences. Substantial complete both-common inconclusive. No-essence complete both-common inconclusive. Substantial partial substantial partial. No-essence partial no-essence partial. Both-common hesitant has two sentences. Both-common complete hesitant. Both-common partial hesitant. [Hesitation is necessarily substantial. It does not relate to no-essence] Both-common subject-dependent has three sentences. Substantial complete both-common subject-dependent. No-essence complete both-common subject-dependent. Substantial partial both-common subject-dependent. [However, there is no no-essence partial both-common subject-dependent. The reason for not making this sentence is as above] Four and two and three combined make nine sentences. Either-one inconclusive [through] combined total eighteen sentences: This explains including hesitation and support also in the either-one inconclusive established by ancient masters. Namely either-one hesitant. Either-one subject-dependent. "Combined total eighteen sentences": either-one inconclusive has eight sentences. Other-either-one has four sentences. [Substantial complete other-either-one. No-essence complete other-either-one. Substantial partial other-either-one. No-essence partial other-either-one] Self-either-one has four sentences. [Substantial complete self-either-one. No-essence complete self-either-one. Substantial partial partial partial. No-essence partial partial partial] Combined eight sentences. Next, either-one hesitant has four sentences. Self-either-one hesitant has two sentences. [Self-either-one complete hesitant. Self-either-one partial hesitant] Other-either-one hesitant two sentences. [Complete and partial should be analogized from above] Combined four sentences. Next, either-one subject-dependent has six sentences. Self-either-one subject-dependent has three sentences [Substantial complete self-either-one subject-dependent. No-essence complete self-either-one subject-dependent. Substantial partial self-either-one subject-dependent. The reason for not making no-essence partial either-one sentences is as above] Other-either-one subject-dependent has three sentences [There are substantial and no-essence complete. Partial should be analogized from above] Combined six sentences. The above eight and four and six total eighteen sentences. Both-common's nine sentences. Either-one's eighteen

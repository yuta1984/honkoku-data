Both establisher and opponent all accept it. Therefore, although there is cause-essence, regarding the matter of applying to the sound thesis, both establisher and opponent are not extremely accomplished. Therefore it is named "mutual non-accomplishment." The manner of later non-accomplishment is most broad. Non-accomplishment among cause-example faults are all of this meaning. The manner of former non-accomplishment is most few within cause-example non-accomplishment. Therefore taking the later as basis to include the former. Hence the commentary says "non-extreme included in cause non-accomplishment." Non-extreme within example non-accomplishment can be known by analogy. Both establisher and opponent lack examples.

"Second, explaining the basis, explaining the previous dharmin etc." The meaning is: the text "namely, extremely accomplished dharmin, extremely accomplished predicate, due to differentiation nature" - placing the character "due to" below "differentiation" manifests that the above dharmin and predicate are originally extremely accomplished. The character "due to" has the meaning of "reason for" and means "thing to be established." It is clearly known that the above dharmin and predicate are originally extremely accomplished and should not require establishment. Therefore the character "due to" is placed below "differentiation" [meaning].

"Following one's own" distinguishes regarding thesis: among the four theses of universally accepted thesis etc., with the words "following one's own," this distinguishes the not-regarding-treatise thesis, not the other three theses [meaning].

"If different from this" etc.: If different from this meaning of "following one's own pleasure as what is to be established nature," [true cause true example] becoming what-is-established, then fallacious cause fallacious example could also be named what-is-established thesis [meaning].

Dingbin's Commentary says: Like the Sāṃkhya teacher establishing "eyes etc. must be for others' use." ○ Manifesting words to the opponent is already one establishment. However it is not pleasure-for. ○ Borrowing this word-manifestation to provisionally establish within other schools, separately establishing mental-intention spirit-self as true other, taking this as what-is-pleased [etc.].

"Fourth, not-regarding-treatise thesis" below has two meanings. Following establisher's sentiment as what should be pleasurable and conveniently establishing means following one's own mental pleasure, not regarding others' meaning. Like Buddhist disciples, [up to]. Not necessarily requiring definite regard means temporarily not regarding one's own school, allying with other schools, the meaning of pleasure-for.

"Explaining differentiation-contradiction cause then by analogy to thesis should accomplish thesis-establishment meaning" etc. Using not-regarding-treatise thesis as reasoning thesis, not the other three. This is constant meaning. Real meaning. Original meaning. However, the present explanation says that dharma-differentiation-contradiction methodology has the meaning of analogical quasi-thesis as secondary meaning.

The so-called "eyes etc. must be for others' use" - although the verbal expression does not say "for false-self others' use," what is made to be seen pleasures false-self other. Therefore mental-intention spirit-self becomes accomplished as secondary meaning. Hence gaining this kind of meaning, this reasoning immediately uses analogical quasi-thesis to become reasoning accomplishing spirit-self. Not limited to this reasoning, various mental-intention reasonings should be like this perhaps. The present explanation's meaning is like this. However, actually those etc. are not-regarding-treatise thesis. This explanation manifests one meaning's aspect. Generally this matter is one investigation of hetuvidyā. There are two transmissions [etc.].

"This above one interpretation depends on Reason Door Treatise, only distinguishing true, not distinguishing fallacious." From here above, the present treatise's text "following one's own pleasure as what is to be established nature" only distinguishes true thesis [excluding not-regarding-treatise thesis, the other three theses] cause-example, not extending to distinguishing fallacious thesis cause-example - one interpretation. This immediately depends on Reason Door Treatise to explain this treatise [meaning]. Zhou's Record quoted in Collected Records has this meaning. The Reason Door Treatise should be consulted.

"Therefore saying pleasure-for distinguishes those three, fallacious thesis cause-example supposing-now and later" etc. has three punctuation points. First says: Therefore saying "pleasure-for" distinguishes "those three fallacious thesis." Cause-example in "supposing-now" and "later" both cannot be said to be cause, to be example. Second says: Distinguishing "those three." Fallacious thesis cause-example, [remaining text as before]. Third says: Distinguishing "those three fallacious thesis cause-example." In supposing-now and later, [remaining text as before]. Among these three points, the first point seems not to fit the text's sequence. The latter two differ in sentence division but their meaning is the same. Immediately fitting the text's sequence. Generally within this answer there are two aspects. First explaining the reason why thesis has pleasure-for words. Fallacious thesis cause-example [up to] "distinguishing those three fallacious thesis cause-example" is this. The meaning is: when speaking of true thesis, expressing pleasure-for is to distinguish that fallacious thesis similar-example are not pleasure-for [meaning]. [However, a concealed difficulty says: fallacious thesis cause-example should further be established, should become thesis. Why are they not pleasure-for? There is this concealed difficulty. Therefore the present text blocks this difficulty, accomplishing the manner that fallacious thesis cause-example are not pleasure-for, and thus manifests the reason why thesis is said to be pleasure-for.] Next explaining the reason why cause-example lack pleasure-for words, correctly answering the question. "Supposing-now and later" etc. below is this. The meaning is: fallacious thesis cause-example, when now established, are not correct cause-example. That meaning is easy to know. When later accomplished, are not correct cause-example. They accomplish thesis therefore. Hence there is no time when as cause-example they should carry pleasure-for words. But after taking as thesis and accomplishing establishment, when again taking them as cause-example, they become

[Lower Section]
progressively distant, not the same as thesis being immediately correctly pleasure-for. Therefore regarding cause-example, pleasure-for words are not explained [meaning].

Among the three points, temporarily depending on one point, this has been recorded. This point corresponds to the meaning of Collected Records. It quotes "supposing-now and later" below and explains its meaning. Know that regarding fallacious thesis cause-example above, "distinguishing those three fallacious thesis cause-example" should be read.

"Below there are ten sentences divided into three categories" etc. Collected Records says: Qing says: These are all Great Treatise texts. Ying says: "Below there are ten sentences" means: immediately Yogācāra Treatise text. First, accepting treatise thesis ○ [etc.]

Perhaps Great Treatise Volume 15. This should be quoted.

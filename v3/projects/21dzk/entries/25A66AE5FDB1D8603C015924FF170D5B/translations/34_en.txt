"establishment" means there is an example-basis (yudra). The basis non-establishment of examples is because there is no example-basis. "Non-existence both non-establishment also has both mutual, etc." refers to the section describing the four non-establishments of non-existence both non-establishment. However, saying "uncertain non-existence both non-establishment" means there is no example-basis. Definitely there are no two establishments. If doubt and certainty are not already different divisions, therefore this sentence is missing [etc.]. This means non-existence both non-establishment has no example-basis, while uncertain non-establishment of examples has an example-basis.

"Provisionally depending on existence both non-establishment, both mutual non-establishment is as the treatise explains" refers to both mutual non-establishment within existence both non-establishment. "As the treatise explains" means when the Sound school establishes against Vaiśeṣika: "sound is permanent because non-obstructed, like pots, etc." Using this as the methodology, the meaning is easy to understand.

"First is self one-sided, like what outsiders establish, etc." refers to self one-sided non-establishment within existence both non-establishment. The commentary says: Zhou says: "Though outsiders permit the existence of empty space, they themselves do not permit empty space to experience pleasure and pain, create karma, etc. This is self one-sided. Because there are no probans and thesis-predicate on empty space, it is called both non-establishment. Against Sautrāntika masters, they do not permit the substantial nature of empty space. Only oneself permits its existence. This is called self one-sided" [etc.]. The meaning is: regarding the establisher's side, it is called self one-sided. There is also other one-sided non-existence both non-establishment, but since this place only explains existence both non-establishment, it does not raise non-existence both non-establishment [etc.].

"Second is other one-sided existence both non-establishment, etc." refers to other one-sided non-establishment within existence both non-establishment. The commentary says: Zhou says: "This raises karma as the positive example. Those Buddhist practitioners, though they permit the existence of karma,

[Lower Section]

do not permit it to be permanent and non-obstructed. Though mental karma is non-obstructed, now we provisionally take bodily and verbal [karma], therefore it becomes other one-sided" [etc.]. Yi says: "Buddhist bodily and verbal [karma] are impermanent and materially obstructed" [etc.].

"If one explains depending on reason and thesis, etc." is one explanation of the basis non-establishment said to exist within existence both non-establishment. Generally regarding basis non-establishment of examples, in judging the basis of examples there are many explanations. According to the correct explanation, within existence both non-establishment there is no basis non-establishment, because the example-basis serves as the basis of examples. Existence both [non-establishment] necessarily has example-basis, while basis non-establishment should have no example-basis. However, what is now said as "if one explains depending on reason and thesis, etc." means that provisionally regarding the explanation that makes thesis-reason the basis of examples, there is also basis non-establishment within existence both non-establishment. Namely, existence both [non-establishment] discusses having example-basis. Basis non-establishment should discuss the absence of thesis-reason. Therefore it exists. Its methodology is the second sentence methodology among the four sentences made above. This is the sentence of existence both non-establishment with non-substantial thesis-reason.

"The previous four types according to their correspondence, etc." - does this refer to both mutual, self one-sided, other one-sided, and uncertain as "the previous four types"? Regarding these four types, each should have distinctions of complete parts, partial parts, etc. [so to speak]. How about excluding basis non-establishment? Regarding basis non-establishment, why are there no distinctions of complete parts, partial parts, etc.? Therefore one should say: "the previous four types" means that each of the four non-establishments listed just previously has differences of complete parts, partial parts, etc. This is because self and other one-sided are combined to make one.

This concludes the four non-establishments of existence both non-establishment.

"Question: The previous two are completely absent [...] are there two: existence and non-existence?" means: regarding the three faults of probans, thesis-predicate, and both, why only regarding both [non-establishment] divide into existence both non-establishment and non-existence both non-establishment, but not divide the previous probans and thesis-predicate? "Two completely absent" refers to probans non-establishment and thesis-predicate non-establishment, calling them "two completely absent." Probans non-establishment completely lacks the probans, thesis-predicate non-establishment completely lacks the thesis-predicate. Contrasted with both non-establishment's "both establishments jointly absent," they are called "completely absent."

"Answer: Joint absence already opens, etc." - joint absence refers to both non-establishment. The opening and non-opening of partial versus joint, existence versus non-existence, are mutually manifest through omission [so to speak]. The meaning is easy to understand. However, the Continued Commentary says: "Answer: Existence can mutually lack. Non-existence does not establish together. Therefore only explain together, not opening two types. Also, joint absence already opens [as in the main commentary], thereby showing the abbreviation, therefore the previous explanation is correct" [etc.]. The second explanation interprets the main commentary text. Now the first explanation's meaning says: probans non-establishment and thesis-predicate non-establishment must be discussed regarding necessarily having example-basis. Among the two establishments, lacking one at random is a matter of having example-basis. If there were no example-basis, it would necessarily become both non-establishment. Therefore probans and thesis-predicate cannot open existence and non-existence, because they are definitely existent. Both non-establishment opens into two: lacking example-basis and also being both non-establishment [so to speak].

Taking this explanation as correct, is the reasoning necessarily so? Now parsing the text: "With existence, they can mutually lack. With non-existence, they do not establish, therefore only explain together, not opening two types." "Explain together" means raising one [so to speak].

"Basis non-establishment, if one explains depending on examples [...] all because of no example-basis" refers to basis non-establishment within non-existence both non-establishment.

[Lower Section]

"Namely what was previously explained, etc." refers to the non-existence both non-establishment methodology explained in the treatise, etc. All methodologies of non-existence both non-establishment are basis non-establishment, because they all lack example-basis. This is the meaning of making example-basis the basis.

"If one explains depending on thesis-reason [...] this is the fourth sentence" refers to making thesis-reason the basis of examples, the meaning of basis non-establishment. The fourth sentence refers to the sentence of non-existence both non-establishment with non-substantial thesis-reason.

"Within this there are also [...] fearing prolixity, not述べed" concludes both mutual etc. of non-existence both non-establishment.

"Question: True-suchness is permanently existent [...] why is it not non-obstructed?" doubts that when raising empty space as an example for the thesis of sound permanence and the reason of non-obstruction, there is both non-establishment. Since empty space is permanent and non-obstructed, it can establish both, having no non-establishment at all [so to speak].

"Answer: Establishing thesis-dharma [...] therefore this is an example fault" means: there are two types in establishing thesis-reason. If establishing mere-negation thesis-reason, using mere-negation positive examples has no fault. If establishing negation-affirmation thesis-reason, using mere-negation positive examples has fault. Now the sound permanence thesis and non-obstruction reason are negation-affirmation thesis-reason. When taking empty space examples against no-space theory, empty space is mere-negation without affirmation. Therefore lacking both establishments, it becomes both non-establishment fault [so to speak].

Saying sound is permanent and non-obstructed means affirming the existence of permanent substance and non-obstructed substance. However, the empty space of no-space theory only negates non-obstruction etc., but is never affirmed to have the substance of that non-obstruction etc. Therefore it does not establish both.

"Some say: Sound school [...] not lacking probans" means Master Wengui provisionally narrates the Sound school's defense. Namely, the Sound school master says: "I against

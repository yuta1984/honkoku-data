Among the three of cause same-different, manifesting one as the head and combining the remaining two as the opposition. Each making four sentences. Therefore becoming three sets of four sentences. One set of two sentences refers to the latter two sentences among those four sentences. These are the two sentences of "all three lacking" and "all three not lacking." Although the three sets of four sentences are each separate, regarding the front and back two sentences, the essence of the three sets does not differ. Therefore they are named one set of two sentences.

Regarding "Although explaining cause three characteristics" etc.: Now, few characteristics lacking means discussing lacking one, lacking two, etc. regarding cause three characteristics as faults. But now it also says "Although explaining cause three characteristics, few characteristics are named lacking." What is this meaning? Having completely explained the cause three characteristics. How can there be lacking faults? Answer: "Although explaining cause three characteristics" means although explaining the words of cause? This should be investigated.

The matter of the difference between few characteristics lacking meaning and few lacking

First, non-essence lacking refers to targeting the complete absence of word branches. Essence lacking means having essence because words are necessarily stated. Regarding this present essence, discussing lacking faults. Distinguished into few characteristics lacking and meaning few lacking. Few characteristics lacking means: although stating cause words, among the three characteristics above them, there are lacking one, lacking two, etc. Therefore naming this few characteristics lacking. Meaning few lacking means: opening the cause three characteristics into cause one, example two, discussing lacking one, lacking two, etc. regarding the three of cause same-different. This is stating cause-example words but having no cause meaning and no example meaning, making them lacking faults. Therefore naming them meaning few lacking. This also has lacking one, lacking two, etc. Now having no example meaning refers to, temporarily, same example being the fault of both non-establishment. Cause and different example can all be known by analogy. The Collected Records explains this. It should be seen.

[Lower Section]
Regarding "Answer: cause intimately accomplishes thesis" etc.: Collected Records says: Zhou says: This answer's meaning says: Cause intimately accomplishes thesis. If there is initial characteristic, then it can accordingly accomplish. If absent, then it is not so. The Logic Gate Treatise's intention explains those who intimately accomplish thesis, therefore in indeterminates, only explains five. Because there is initial characteristic. The four types of non-establishment already lack initial characteristic. Therefore they are not explained. Definite contradiction lacks all three characteristics. Therefore also not explained [etc.]. Also says □ same-different accomplishing thesis is distant, therefore only marking their accordance-violation: Calling cause "distant" is because of □ cause. Accordance means although many are correct causes, briefly explaining 2-8. Violation means although there are four contradictions, briefly explaining there is one dharma-self-characteristic contradiction [etc].

Regarding "Temporarily using among initial characteristic three sentences" etc.: Question: Below the three characteristics, each has four sentences. Why regarding initial characteristic say three sentences? Which sentence among four sentences is excluded? Answer: Not so. Below initial characteristic, there are only three sentences. Therefore that text says: "By this should distinguish for various sentences. Having thesis-dharma but not universal. Having universal and also thesis-dharma. Having non-universal non-thesis-dharma. Necessarily absent is universal non-thesis-dharma sentence" [etc].

Regarding "Having thesis-dharma but not universal. Not being same category non-definite existence" etc.:

Initial characteristic three sentences
Thesis-dharma non-universal. Universal and also thesis-dharma. Non-universal non-thesis-dharma.

Second characteristic four sentences
Same category non-definite existence. Definite existence non-same category. Definite existence and also same category. Non-same category non-definite existence.

Third characteristic four sentences
Different category non-universal absence. Universal absence non-different category. Different category and also universal absence. Non-different category non-universal absence.

The present text uses initial characteristic first sentence to oppose second characteristic first sentence, making four sentences. Like this, temporarily using initial characteristic first sentence to oppose second characteristic second sentence, there are also four sentences. Also using initial characteristic first sentence to oppose second characteristic third sentence, there are four sentences. Opposing second characteristic fourth sentence, there are four sentences. Like this, with initial characteristic first sentence as head, opposing second characteristic four sentences, there are four sets of four sentences. Like this, still with initial characteristic first sentence as head, opposing third characteristic four sentences, there are also four sets of four sentences. Combined, eight sets of four sentences. The above is the three divisions with initial characteristic first sentence as head. Like this, with initial characteristic second sentence as head, with initial characteristic third sentence as head, all can be known by analogy. Therefore initial characteristic three sentences each become heads, totally having three sets of eight sentences. The rest can be analogized.

Regarding "forty-five types of four sentences, one type of three sentences, one type of two sentences": First, forty refers to the forty types of four sentences under each opposing mutual following absence. Five types refers to: under each opposing, the latter two characteristics each having four sentences, first becoming two types of four sentences. Next, under mutual following absence, three types of four sentences. Combining these makes five types of four sentences. Above totally combined, forty-five types of four sentences.

Next, one type of three sentences refers to initial characteristic three sentences under each opposing. Next, one type of two sentences refers to

[Lower Section]
one type of two sentences under mutual following absence. Each individual sentence, in terms of conduct characteristics, has all been clarified. Seeing the text, this can be known. [The commentary's above text has clarified this.]

Regarding "cause in existence-nonexistence [up to] separately questioning the two": Explaining that the latter two characteristics have confusion, therefore separately questioning. Namely, having confusion means: explaining thesis same-different necessarily follows cause existence-nonexistence; explaining cause same-different necessarily follows thesis accordance-violation. The practice of correct cause is: where cause exists, thesis necessarily follows; where thesis exists, cause necessarily exists. Already being like this, using example to regard thesis or regard cause, their meanings mutually do not separate. Because they mix together, now to manifest the distinction of this thesis same-different and cause same-different, it is especially appropriate to separately question the latter two characteristics [meaning].

Regarding "because cause is only [up to] therefore not questioning and explaining": Explaining that initial characteristic has no confusion, therefore not questioning. Namely, having no confusion means: regarding thesis, among having general thesis established and separate extremely established predicate, the present universally being thesis-dharma thesis is the uncontested subject. Therefore initial characteristic being universally the dharma-nature above thesis-subject, being named cause characteristic has no confusion. Hence although there are separate-general regarding thesis, because meaning has no confusion, it is not questioned.

Regarding "Second, thesis is subject" etc.: This is the second explanation. "Above already clarified" probably refers to the text of extremely established subject, extremely established predicate, etc. This text has already clarified universally being thesis-dharma nature essence. The essence of what cause-dharma pervades and depends upon is extremely established subject.

Regarding "two categories not yet clarified" etc.: The present text says same category definite existence, different category universal non-existence, but above has not yet clarified the characteristics of same category and different category. Therefore questioning this.

"Inseparable nature, same category also"

"Like water and land flowers": That receives its name from what it depends on (the other). This receives its name from the dharma gate it depends on. Therefore it serves as an example.

"Ascetic practices, emaciation and fatigue, etc.": This is one aspect among the twenty-four aspects of Maheśvara (the great sovereign deity). That deity manifests the appearance of ascetic practices like bone chains. Therefore it is called the Bone-Chain Deity. This does not refer to people who serve the deity practicing asceticism until they become like bone chains. The detailed interpretation in the Myōtō-shō follows this meaning.

[Manuscript note: Original manuscript insert states]
"Because hetu has three characteristics and the meaning is broad, etc.":
Now it says "Because hetu has three characteristics, etc." - this is an explanation of the one hetu, two examples, and three members. The intention is that because hetu broadly encompasses both thesis and examples, it is not the same as thesis and examples which lack this meaning.

Next, "Moreover, all the means of proof, etc." - this is an explanation of one hetu, two examples, and three characteristics in meaning. The meaning is: the two examples of similarity and dissimilarity are the latter two characteristics of hetu. Therefore they receive the name hetu. Since the thesis is what is to be established, following the means of proof it is also called hetu.

"Raising the genuine to include the pseudo, etc.": To raise the genuine and include the pseudo means to take the genuine as primary and include the pseudo as secondary. Or "already included" means there is no primary-secondary distinction between genuine and pseudo - both are included together. Or "incidentally clarifying them" means properly speaking they are not included, but as types they are made known incidentally. Or it is said that "raising the genuine to include the pseudo" is the general statement, and the next two "or" statements express separate meanings.

"Four questions about proof and refutation... therefore all are hetuvidyā": The meaning of this question and answer, according to Myōtō-shō, is: The question's intent is that proof and refutation are the gate of understanding others, while perception and inference are the gate of self-understanding. In understanding others there are words that serve as causes to generate knowledge - this should be hetuvidyā. In self-understanding there are no words, no causes arise to generate knowledge - this should not be hetuvidyā. The answer's intent is that perception and inference "have no knowledge or words" - their essence is not words, therefore they are called "without words." They cannot directly generate the knowledge of opponents and witnesses, therefore they are called "without knowledge." Although their essence is knowledge, they do not generate others' knowledge, therefore they are called "without knowledge." If one uses words to understand causes, there are none that are causes but not words. Because one does not use words to understand causes, there are causes that are not words. To reveal this meaning it says "seeing causes are also clear, etc." There are two explanations for this. First: "Seeing causes are also clear, etc." is explained in terms of three divisions. "Seeing" refers to the seeing division. Because it serves as object, it draws forth self-witness. Therefore it is called a cause. The essence of seeing is discrimination, so it is called clarity. Because cause is identical to clarity, this is a karmadhāraya compound. The word "also" in the text reveals the karmadhāraya meaning. This refers to the seeing division of inference. "Seeing self-witness clarity" means the seeing division serves as object and generates self-witness, therefore it is called cause. Being free from all discrimination and witnessing the self-characteristics clearly, it is called "witnessing clarity." This refers to the seeing division of perception. "Self-witness is also cause" refers to the self-witness division. It can generate the seeing and objective aspects, so it is called cause. It is self-illuminating and is also called clarity. Since clarity is also cause, all are hetuvidyā. The word "also" in the text has this meaning. The second explanation says "seeing causes are also clear, etc." is explained in terms of two valid cognitions. "Seeing causes are also clear" refers to inferential cognition. By seeing that cause, inferential cognition arises and understands the inferred meaning - this is called clarity. Because it is clarity of the cause, this is a tatpuruṣa compound. Like seeing the three-characteristic cause and inferentially knowing that sound is impermanent, etc. "Seeing causes witness clarity" refers to perceptual cognition. By seeing that cause, perceptual cognition arises and witnesses and understands that cause - this is called clarity. Because it is clarity of the cause, this is a tatpuruṣa compound. Like seeing smoke and knowing it is a cause of fire, seeing it perceptually and

witnessing and knowing it is smoke. Therefore it says "seeing causes witness clarity." These two kinds of valid cognition each witness their own objects. In relation to objects they are causes - not only do they serve as clarity, they can also serve as causes because they indirectly awaken others. Even if it says "self-witness is also cause," the main point of this answer is that not only words are causes - there are also causes that are not words. What are called "causes that are not words"? These are the seeing division, self-witness division, and the two valid cognitions of inference and perception. Although these are only causes and not words, because each has the meaning of hetuvidyā, even though they have no words and do not generate others' knowledge, they are all called hetuvidyā.

[Manuscript note with ancient reading provided]

I have considered this and provided a reading. Does this not resemble the ancient punctuation?

"The answer is due to non-determination, etc.": This answer explains why the thesis is not called hetuvidyā. Because the thesis is not determined, it is not hetuvidyā. Because causes and examples are determined, they are called hetuvidyā.

[Manuscript note: According to Myōtō-shō, "non-determination" has two meanings: 1) Because ancient and modern [scholars] dispute with each other, it is not determined - ancient masters considered the thesis to be the means of proof, while current doctrine holds the thesis is what is to be established. 2) Because proponent and opponent dispute with each other, it is not determined. The two members of cause and example are accepted by both proponent and opponent, therefore they are determined.]

"Moreover, able-cause and able-clarity, etc.": Able-cause and able-clarity refer to cause and example. What-is-caused and what-is-clarified refer to the thesis.

"The answer is that effects have the clarity of effects, etc.": Clarity means the meaning of decisive understanding. The current "effect" refers to the thesis. Because the thesis is not determined, it says "effects have the clarity of effects, but not all effects are identical to clarity." Because causes are determined, it says "causes have the clarity of causes, so all these causes are identical to clarity." "Meaning also has confusion" and what follows all have this intention.

Systematic arrangement... treatise thesis [verse]. In the preceding... explanation therefore [prose commentary].

"Because it is free from seven, etc.": This refers to the faulty nature of incompleteness. Question: Speaking of seven in regard to the faulty nature of incompleteness follows the ancient masters' intention. According to Chen-na and others' intention, there are only six sentences - they do not establish a seventh sentence. Now saying "seven, etc." - is this the ancient masters' intention? How so? Answer: Regarding the three characteristics, there are the three characteristics of words and the three characteristics of meaning. The three characteristics of words refer to the words of the three members. The three characteristics of meaning refer to the three characteristics of causes. Speaking of the three characteristics of words [margin note: this is called "incorporeal" - what is lacking in characteristics necessarily has no words], there is no seventh sentence. That is: lacking one, having three [lacking one throughout the three members]; lacking two, having three [lacking two as appropriate among the three members] - therefore there are six sentences. If one speaks of a seventh sentence, it would be incorporeal, because all three members would be lacking. Since this would be wordless, how could it constitute a numbered sentence? Therefore Chen-na and others do not establish it. Speaking of the three characteristics of meaning [margin note: this is called "substantial incompleteness" - although characteristics are lacking as appropriate, words are not lost], there are specifically seven sentences. That is: lacking one, having three [lacking one as appropriate among the three characteristics]; lacking two, having three;

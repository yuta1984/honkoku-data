[lacking two among the three characteristics], lacking three and having one [lacking causes entirely among the three characteristics]. Therefore there are seven sentences. Although this seventh sentence lacks the three characteristics, there must definitely be words. Therefore it suffices to constitute a numbered sentence. Chen-na and others should permit this seventh sentence. Therefore, when this commentary says "because it is free from seven, etc.," it originally discusses causes and examples. Hence, in relation to the three characteristics of meaning, it says "free from seven, etc." Now regarding this "substantial incompleteness," whether the seventh sentence exists or not is still undetermined. As follows below. For now I record this according to one interpretation only.

"Because it is free from fourteen, etc." refers to fourteen for causes and ten for examples. "Because both dependent and support are completely fulfilled" - according to the Collected Records: Zhou says that dharma is the dependent and dharma-possessor is the support.

According to Myōtō-shō: The dependent refers to the thesis of inseparable nature, and the support refers to self-nature and particularities. "Through this treatise revealing the true without falsehood, etc." - according to Bei: This treatise text only reveals faults of commission, not faults of omission. Actually it could also reveal faults of omission. The three faults described in the treatise text are only faults of commission, not faults of omission.

"Skillfully refuting their errors" [revealing faults to refute]. "Or skillfully examining the thesis" [establishing syllogisms to refute].

"Various treatises only manifest and reveal others' faults for refutation, etc." - Question: When various treatises only attest to revealing faults for refutation, what treatise text is this? Are not texts like the four contradictions all explaining syllogistic refutation? Answer: Myōtō-shō cites this text and quotes Master Zhao, seeming to doubt this. The tendency of that doubt is like the present inquiry. Although raising doubts, is there no clarifying explanation? Collected Records says: Is there nothing clear in the text? This should be investigated.

The fourteen fallacious types are:

[End indentation]
1. Similar dharma resemblance fallacy. 2. Different dharma different dharma different dharma. 3. Discrimination discrimination discrimination. 4. No difference no difference no difference. 5. Obtainable obtainable obtainable. 6. Doubt doubt doubt. 7. Analogical inference analogical inference analogical inference. 8. Reaching non-reaching reaching non-reaching reaching non-reaching. 9. No cause no cause no cause. 10. No statement no statement no statement. 11. No arising no arising no arising. 12. Constructed constructed constructed. 13. Arising-ceasing arising-ceasing arising-ceasing. 14. Permanent permanent permanent. These fourteen types all involve unreasonable verbal refutation of genuine means of proof, therefore they are all pseudo-refutations. "Therefore mostly they all awaken others" - Question: When it says "mostly awaken others," does a small part extend to self-awakening? Answer: Yes. That is, means of proof and refutation only awaken others. Pseudo-proof and pseudo-refutation extend to self-awakening. Although the original intention is to awaken others, when others refute one's own errors, one immediately gains the portion of self-awakening. Therefore it says "mostly." "In the later text of this treatise... cannot awaken others, etc." - according to Myōtō-shō: Taking preceding and following texts together to speak. The later text is not from one place. "Means of proof awaken others" - the treatise's earlier text says: "Having explained thesis, etc., when such various words awaken others, they are called means of proof." "Means of refutation awaken others" - the treatise's later text says: "If correctly revealing faults of means of proof, this is called means of refutation." "Pseudo-proof does not awaken others" - the treatise's earlier text says: "Such pseudo-thesis, pseudo-cause, pseudo-example words are not correct means of proof." Pseudo-refutation does not awaken others - the treatise's later text says: "If not genuinely revealing faults of means of proof, such words are called pseudo-refutation." These four passages are located below the text on thesis and other three members. Therefore it says "later text."

Collected Records says: A certain commentary says: This meaning, since [text difficult to read] in the prose commentary under pseudo-proof, "cannot awaken others." This clearly shows it extends to self-awakening. This treatise is exactly the same as that Nyāyamukha, etc.

Investigation: Regarding the current commentary text, there are doubts. First, the matter of pseudo-proof and pseudo-refutation awakening others is inevitable. And because the verse text "pseudo only awakens others" is clear. Therefore even if there were a portion of self-awakening, this would be based on awakening others extending to self-awakening. But to confusedly say "pseudo-words and pseudo-refutation cannot awaken others" is most questionable. Next, using later text as evidence to definitely show it extends to self-awakening, saying it "exactly matches that [Nyāyamukha]" in comparison - how is this? Looking at the later text quoted in Myōtō-shō, regarding pseudo-proof and pseudo-refutation, it neither mentions self-awakening nor other-awakening. How can this serve as reliable evidence? If taking "not mentioning awakening others" to prove extension to self-awakening, then why not also take "not mentioning self-awakening" to prove limitation to awakening others?

Answer: The matter of pseudo-proof and pseudo-refutation awakening others is indeed inevitable, because the verse text is clear. Also, extending to self-awakening is inevitable. Beyond reasonable principle, the "as appropriate" language of Nyāyamukha and the commentary's explanation are most meaningful. Here examining the treatise's later text, regarding pseudo-proof and pseudo-refutation there are no words about awakening others. This could most serve as supporting evidence. The "as appropriate" language of Nyāyamukha, viewing it together with the current later text, the meaning is exactly the same. Just combining both sides to infer the meaning together. Perhaps not sufficient to serve as definitive reliable evidence? "Cannot awaken others" means the meaning of not saying "awaken others." The later text does not say "awaken others." Therefore, investigating the upper and lower texts of this treatise, the initial verse says "only awaken others," the later text omits "awaken others language." This clearly shows that pseudo-proof and pseudo-refutation are based on awakening others but extend to self-awakening. Just regarding this, the word "only" should be interpreted, because it appeared to limit to awakening others. Therefore in this verse "according to the majority" and following interpret the word "only" to make it extend to self-awakening.

Investigation: Is pseudo-perception inference or non-cognition? Answer: Non-cognition. Because it says "falsely claiming to apprehend essence is called pseudo-perception." Investigation: What is the essence of non-discriminative pseudo-perception? Answer: According to Myōtō-shō: Non-discriminative refers to confused mind, etc. There is no object of awareness. Collected Records says: Yup says: Not being spontaneous yet seeing sky flowers, second moons, etc. - although non-discriminative, it is not perception. Also says: Ying says those who are stupid, slow and dull, although having scattered mind, cannot clearly understand objects, called non-discriminative.

Investigation: What kind of mental state is pseudo-inference? Answer: Also non-cognition. "Contradictory cognition arises, etc." - when presenting erroneous three members, the opposing witnesses do not generate concordant cognition but generate contradictory cognition.

"Even if what is to be established succeeds, both sides diverge, etc." - Collected Records says: Zhou says this is definite contradiction, etc.

"If perception's objects have hidden principles and manifest phenomena" - Collected Records says: Zhou says principles like suffering and emptiness in form, sound, etc. are called hidden, while form, etc. as phenomena are called manifest. Also says: Later records say... This refers to the stage of cause; if the stage of effect, emptiness and non-self would also be called manifest. Pre-path preparatory bodhisattvas in meditative states also cognize principles like emptiness and non-self, which should also be called manifest. Now it speaks according to ordinary scattered mind in the stage of cause.

"Therefore determining these two" refers to perception and inference as the two determinations. "Perception-inference cause and effect" means each of the two valid cognitions has cause and effect. That is, understanding the self-characteristics of smoke is perception

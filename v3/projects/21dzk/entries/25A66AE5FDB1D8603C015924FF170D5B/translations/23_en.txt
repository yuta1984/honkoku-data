[Upper Section]

With perception as head, there are twenty-one sets of four sentences. Namely, temporarily setting perception aside. Because it serves as the counterpart for four sentences. [Now temporarily making it the foundation] Inference also necessarily exists in each one by one, so it is also set aside. [Now regarding the place of mutual alternation, temporarily making it the foundation]

Therefore, first taking self-teaching as counterpart, there are six two-combinations. Taking worldly as counterpart, there are five two-combinations. Taking self-statement as counterpart, there are four two-combinations. Taking predicate as counterpart, there are three two-combinations. Taking subject as counterpart [the character "能" may be superfluous], there are two two-combinations. Taking both-not as counterpart, there is one two-combination. Thus to these twenty-one two-combinations, adding inference to each one by one. Therefore they become twenty-one three-combinations. After completing this construction, to these twenty-one three-combinations, each taking perception as counterpart to make four sentences. Therefore they become twenty-one sets of four sentences.

With inference as head, there are fifteen sets of four sentences. Having discarded perception, discussing those from inference downward. Namely, temporarily setting inference aside. Because it serves as counterpart for four sentences. Self-teaching also necessarily exists in each one by one, so it is still set aside. Therefore taking worldly as counterpart, there are five two-combinations. The rest are as above. Four, three, two, one, decreasing in sequence. Thus there are fifteen two-combinations. Adding self-teaching to each one by one, they become fifteen three-combinations. After constructing thus, these fifteen three-combinations each serve as the opposed, with that inference each serving as counterpart to make four sentences one by one. Therefore they become fifteen sets of four sentences.

With self-teaching as head, there are ten sets of four sentences. Discarding perception and inference, focusing on those from self-teaching downward. The remaining meanings can all follow the previous.

[Lower Section]

With worldly as head, there are six sets of four sentences. With self-statement as head, there are three sets of four sentences. With predicate as head, there is one set of four sentences. All discard the previous and focus on the latter. Each meaning should all follow the previous.

Twenty-one, fifteen, ten, six, three, one. Combined, fifty-six sets.

Above completes four-combination faults.

Five-combination faults have thirty-five sets of four sentences. [Taking five as the maximum number, decreasing in sequence. Five is the maximum number for constructing the previous two-combinations]

With perception as head, there are fifteen sets of four sentences. Namely, temporarily setting perception aside. Because it serves as counterpart for four sentences. Inference and self-teaching necessarily exist in each one by one, so they are also set aside. Therefore those from worldly downward, taking each one by one as counterpart, decreasing in sequence. Hence there are fifteen two-combinations. Adding inference and self-teaching to each one by one. Therefore they become fifteen four-combinations. Taking these fifteen four-combinations as the opposed, with perception as counterpart, making four sentences for each one by one. Therefore they become fifteen sets of four sentences.

With inference as head, there are ten sets of four sentences. Discarding perception, focusing on those from inference downward. Inference serves as counterpart for four sentences, so it is temporarily set aside. Self-teaching and worldly necessarily exist in each one by one, so they are also set aside. Those from self-statement downward, as above, first have ten two-combinations. Adding self-teaching and worldly to each one by one, making them ten four-combinations. Taking these ten four-combinations as the opposed, each taking inference as counterpart to make four sentences. Therefore they become ten sets of four sentences.

With self-teaching as head, there are six sets of four sentences. With worldly as head, there are three sets of four sentences. With self-statement as head, there is one set of four sentences. Various matters such as discarding the previous and focusing on the latter should follow the above. Ten

five, ten, six, three, one. Combined, thirty-five sets.

Above completes five-combination faults.

Six-combination faults have twenty sets of four sentences. [Taking four as the maximum number, decreasing in sequence. Four is the maximum number for constructing the previous two-combinations]

With perception as head, there are ten sets of four sentences. Namely, temporarily setting perception aside. Inference, self-teaching, and worldly necessarily exist in each one by one, so they are also temporarily set aside. Therefore those from self-statement downward, each serving as counterpart in sequence, abbreviated in sequence, so there are first ten two-combinations. Adding inference, self-teaching, and worldly to each one by one, they become ten five-combinations. Taking these as the opposed, with perception as counterpart, making four sentences for each one by one. Therefore they become ten sets of four sentences.

With inference as head, there are six sets of four sentences. Discarding perception, focusing on those from inference downward. Inference is temporarily set aside. Self-teaching, worldly, and self-statement exist in each one by one, so they are also set aside. Those from predicate downward, each serving as counterpart in sequence. First constructing two-combinations as above. Immediately there are six two-combinations. Adding self-teaching, worldly, and self-statement to each one by one. Therefore they become six five-combinations. Taking these six as the opposed, with inference as counterpart, making four sentences for each one by one. They become six sets of four sentences.

With self-teaching as head, there are three sets of four sentences. With worldly as head, there is one set of four sentences. All should follow the previous instances. Ten, six, three, one. Combined, twenty sets.

Above completes six-combination faults.

Seven-combination faults have ten sets of four sentences. [Taking three as the maximum number. This is the maximum number of two-combinations]

[Lower Section]

With perception as head, there are six sets of four sentences. Namely, temporarily setting perception aside. Inference, self-teaching, worldly, and self-statement necessarily exist, so they are also set aside. Those from predicate downward, each serving as counterpart. There are six two-combinations. To these six, each adding inference, self-teaching, worldly, and self-statement. Therefore they become six six-combinations. Taking these six six-combinations as the opposed, with perception [possibly missing the character "為" after "量"] as counterpart, making four sentences for each one by one. Therefore they become six sets of four sentences.

With inference as head, there are three sets of four sentences. Discarding perception, focusing on those from inference downward. The rest follow the above.

With self-teaching as head, there is one set of four sentences. Matters such as discarding the previous and focusing on the latter should all follow the above. Six, three, one. Combined, ten sets of four sentences.

Above completes seven-combination faults.

Eight-combination faults have four sets of four sentences. [Taking two as the maximum number. This is the maximum number of two-combinations]

With perception as head, there are three sets of four sentences. Perception is temporarily set aside. Inference, self-teaching, worldly, self-statement, and predicate necessarily exist, so they are also set aside. Regarding those from subject downward, first taking subject as counterpart, regarding the remaining two, following this separately, there are two two-combinations. Next taking both-not as counterpart looking toward mutual agreement, there is one two-combination. In total, three two-combinations. To these three, adding inference, self-teaching, worldly, self-statement, and predicate to each one by one. Therefore they become seven-combinations. To these three seven-combinations, adding perception as counterpart, making four sentences for each one by one. Therefore they become three sets of four sentences.

With inference as head, there is one set of four sentences. Discarding perception and focusing on those from inference downward. The rest can follow

Private Commentary on the Great Commentary of Hetuvidyā [Middle Volume, Part 2]

"Those who distinguish contradictions, etc." below

Regarding "namely what is said here - the moon contains/embraces rabbits," etc. - see the Western Regions Record, Volume 7. Indra was moved by the rabbit's self-sacrifice and placed it in the moon disc, transmitting this to later people [etc.]. [This legend is as usual. Taking the essential point.] Today's saying that there are rabbits in the moon comes from this transmission. Question: Looking at the commentary text, the moon becomes the rabbit-embracer [seen]. If it is in the moon, why say "the moon is the rabbit-embracer"? Also, what is the meaning of "embrace"? Answer: The Collected Records quotes a certain commentary saying: "rabbit-embracer" means "storehouse." The meaning records that there are rabbits in the moon [etc.]. According to this meaning, the character "embrace" has the meaning of "storehouse." Since the moon contains and stores rabbits within it, the moon is named "rabbit-embracer." Because the moon is something that embraces rabbits. If so, the commentary's statement "the moon is the rabbit-embracer" is clear in its meaning. There are still different interpretations of this matter. I have tentatively recorded one interpretation.

The examination of the Yogācāra inference and Bhāviveka's inference are as in the separate paper

"Self-statement contradiction, etc." below

Regarding "such as saying all statements are false," etc. - the Bright Lamp Commentary considers this inference to be one-part self-statement contradiction [etc. taking the gist]. There is doubt about this. In this inference, immediately the predicate "all are false" contradicts the essence of the subject "all statements," therefore this part is made self-statement contradiction. Following that the statement "all are false" expresses falsity and truth, it should contradict the subject "all statements." If so, this is complete self-statement contradiction. Why interpret it as one-part? Based on this, in the next text below, when making the four sentences of partial and complete categories, this present inference is immediately included in the complete sentence. The Bright Lamp Commentary is not careful [note: "wang" is probably "shen" meaning careful]. How so? Answer: It is indeed as the objection states. However, that commentary's intention is that following the present statement of falsity and truth, within the language of the subject "all statements," since it already generally includes both false and non-false statements, the predicate "all are false" contradicts the subject. Since this fault emerges, pointing to this basis, it perhaps interprets it as a one-part fault. This should also be examined further.

Question: The two types of four sentences of self-statement contradiction that the commentary presents are all merely methods of self-teaching contradiction. Why are they also made self-statement contradiction? Answer: The present commentary's four-sentence text quotes Master Bi's text, which the commentary master does not agree with. However, Master Bin's refutation of Master Bi is precisely the point of doubt and difficulty. The Bright Lamp Commentary cites this background and, in rescuing Master Bin's objection, says: Tentatively, in the Lokāyata school, the four elements truly exist as four greats [note: "chi" is probably "da" meaning great]. This is indeed the reliable teaching that their school takes as master. Therefore, that the four elements establish true existence needs no saying. This immediately establishes non-reality. Is this not contradicting self-statement? The four elements of that school immediately express reality in their statements. Therefore, taking contradiction with self-teaching and self-statement, this also becomes this fault [meaning]. This point is immediately clear in the commentary text. Also regarding "both, either-one, complete, uncertain, etc." - concerning self-statement contradiction, there is definite self-statement contradiction and uncertain self-statement contradiction. Definite means ordinary self-statement contradiction, as explained above. Uncertain is like establishing that where smoke and clouds are indeterminate, there can be fire, etc. This also has various sentences: self complete uncertain self-statement contradiction, other complete self-statement contradiction [what the commentary calls "either-one" refers to this]

[Lower Section]

both complete self-statement contradiction [what the commentary calls "both" refers to this]. This is the scope that the commentary raises. By analogy, there should also be three types of one-part faults. This is precisely the point of reverse writing, etc.

"Subject-term not established, etc." below

Regarding "Question: if one says 'I am thought'" [up to] "then there is no fault; if not, it becomes [faulty]" - first, this question concerns the inference mentioned above "I am impermanent," etc., when marking distinguishing words, there is immediately no error. This doubt arises. The question's meaning says: Like placing the word "ultimate" in shared comparative inference to distinguish worldly contradictions, etc., that matter is reasonable because the thesis-support is mutually accepted. Like the present "saying I am thought," since it has already become "subject-term statement not established," how can one place distinguishing words to establish the divine self as existing? Even if distinguishing terms are placed, since the thesis-support is not mutually accepted, one cannot escape the fault. When placing distinguishing terms, saying that generally all is without fault cannot be correct [meaning]. The answer's meaning says: In self-comparative and other-comparative [inference], although the thesis-support is not mutually accepted, they also place distinguishing words and finish. Then there is no fault. For the present subject-term "I," if established by non-Buddhists, one should place the words "I say"; if established by Buddha-dharma, one should place the words "what you maintain." Namely, tentatively, the distinguishing words "I say" necessarily have a referent, just as words like "form" necessarily have referents. Therefore, when these words are needed, there is immediately no fault. If not so, then a fault is immediately formed [meaning]. Therefore the commentary says: what is called "I as designation" is not the divine self, but one's own accepted meaning. It is precisely the meaning of "ego." This is a matter of distinguishing words. Also, saying "if not, it becomes [faulty]" means if not so, then a fault is formed [meaning]. Also, in the question saying "whether I, etc., exist" refers to the divine self. [The above is the meaning of the Bright Lamp Commentary, etc.] Regarding the first fault among the above two faults

[up to] the latter fault - concerning the sequence of the treatise text, it does not say "first fault, latter fault." The prior statement is called "first fault," the latter statement is called "latter fault." Therefore, subject-term not established and predicate-term not established have names like support not established and dependent not established, as follows. Regarding "therefore the thesis established does not correspond with the dependent, etc." - this is because, having raised the names of thesis-support, support, and dependent above, the adjacent thesis-essence of inseparable nature of the thesis established lacks this name.

"Both not established, etc." below

Regarding "there is both predicate-term not established, both neither subject-term" [up to] "in predicate-term not established, the complete both-neither sentence is" - Question: What is now pointed to is the third sentence among the complete four sentences of predicate-term not established [period missing?]. However, that is a sentence of both predicate-term not established. Since it is already a "both" sentence, it is completely not a "both-neither" sentence. Now why call it a "both-neither" sentence? Answer: Concerning predicate-term not established, not being self-other not established is ordinarily not the characteristic of a "both" sentence. However, saying "both-neither" - is this not this meaning? Namely, the predicate-term is not established for both self and other, therefore named "both." The subject-term is not "not established" for both self and other, therefore named "neither." Now combining these, it is called a "both-neither sentence." The sentence of both predicate-term not established - the subject-term should definitely be both-neither not established.

Regarding "there is both subject-term not established" [up to] "in subject-term not established, complete both-neither sentence" - this both-neither sentence should also follow the previous [pattern].

"The above three faults all prove self-characteristics, etc." below

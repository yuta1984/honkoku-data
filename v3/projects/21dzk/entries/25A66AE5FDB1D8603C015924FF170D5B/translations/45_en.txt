From "Pseudo-causal cognition etc." below
[End of indentation]

"Configuring and explaining the three phrases and three passages in order" - the marginal notes say: When the treatise says "pseudo-causal cognition," this initially indicates pseudo-causes. Next when the treatise says "taking precedence in recording various pseudo-meaning cognitions," this next indicates pseudo-substance. Next when the treatise says "called pseudo-inference," this later indicates pseudo-names. Also says: When the treatise says "pseudo-causes are manifold, as already explained previously, using those as causes," this explains the initial pseudo-causes. Next when the treatise says "regarding pseudo-objects of inference, various cognitions arise," this explains the next pseudo-substance. ○ Next when the treatise says "unable to correctly understand, called pseudo-inference," this explains the later pseudo-names. Since it already says "configuring and explaining in order" [etc.]. Therefore "or later shadow-manifesting" is the second explanation. "Three phrases, three passages etc." is the text that comprehensively configures explanations. Using the three phrases, can they not be attached to "or again shadow-manifesting"? Or in certain punctuated editions, those who attach the three phrases above contradict these marginal notes?

"Pseudo-causes manifold etc." below
[End of indentation]

"Following direct perception, in the indication there should also be said etc." - above explains the presence or absence of cognition within pseudo-causes in the two passages of indication and explanation. In the indication, pseudo-causes also raise cognition, but in the explanation, pseudo-causes raise causes. Now this text explains that both indication and explanation should have words that are abbreviated. And the words about erroneously remembering the thoughts of non-separation between the established thesis and causes. This is also the generating cause of pseudo-inference that understands pseudo-thesis, so it should exist.

Inquiring: If so, then in explaining pseudo-causes, why not raise cognition? Answer: The commentary's intention preserves abbreviation. Therefore first, what exists in indication-explanation is abbreviated, second, both indication and explanation are abbreviated together. The reason for that abbreviation

From "That is, initially the established [argument's] deficiency-reduction error-nature etc." below
[End of indentation]

"These deficiency-reductions [up to] all explained as before" - the marginal notes say: From Dignāga onward, regarding the three characteristics of causes, there are also six or seven. Explaining: "Or six" refers to the doctrine established by Dignāga and Bhadanta. "Or seven" refers to doctrines established by other various masters. Therefore the upper volume says: Bodhisattva Dignāga, with one cause and two examples, explains there are six errors. These are the six errors of the three characteristics of causes. Lacking one has three, lacking two has three, there is no lacking three. Master Bhadanta also excludes the seventh. Other various masters do not consent to exclude it. In the one cause two examples, namely the three characteristics of causes, although stating the thesis, not stating examples like Sāṅkhya - grasping the self as thought, not stating cause-examples. How could this not be an error? [etc.]

Ancient masters regarding thesis-cause-example, or seven-six sentences. Explaining: This establishes deficiency errors regarding the three of thesis-cause-example. "Or seven" refers to doctrine established by Vasubandhu. Therefore the upper volume says: Bodhisattva Vasubandhu's deficiency-reduction error-nature: among thesis-cause-example, lacking one has three, lacking two has three, lacking three has one [etc.]. "Or six" refers to doctrines established by other various masters. Therefore the commentary says: After Vasubandhu, all deepen the seventh. Using thesis-cause-example three as the establisher. What is generally lacking is then non-[valid]. Since originally without substance, what forms the establisher? What deficiency exists to obtain the pseudo-name? [etc.]

If like these marginal notes, then in Dignāga's doctrine there is no seven-sentence explanation? If so, then how does the next lower text say "or provisionally regarding Dignāga's three characteristics of causes as seven sentences"? Also in the upper volume's place explaining the eight

gates [to] the annotation says "therefore separating from seven etc." [etc.]. Does this also not state Dignāga's correct doctrine? Therefore the present marginal notes say there is no overlap. This should be investigated.

Question: "How are the established [arguments] deficient-reduced etc." - generally branch deficiencies and branches having errors, the present inference is what is refuted. Not the opponent's refuting words. Yet now the treatise lists names of refutation, saying "deficiency-reduction error-nature [up to] and example error-nature," therefore questioning this. Refutation should be the opponent's words pointing out errors. Why make the establisher's erroneous words into refutation? [meaning]

In the answer there are greatly two explanations. The first explanation is as questioned. The present text "That is, initially the establisher [up to] and example error-nature" correctly raises refutation to resolve doubt. Or saying (second explanation) "this only etc." and below is not as questioned. The present text raises the objects of refutation. Those objects are immediately what is refuted. Therefore raising "deficiency-reduction [up to] example errors." Therefore not raising refutation. The correct refutation is raised in the text below. The text "manifesting these words to enlighten questioners" is this. Therefore first raising those objects, next raising those abilities [meaning]. In the first explanation, resolving difficulties has two meanings. The first meaning speaks of what is refuted regarding refutation, the latter meaning speaks of agent names regarding what is done [meaning]. The meaning is easy to understand. Now analyzing and judging this one section above, though there are two meanings of three sections and four sections, both make the present text the section explaining objects of refutation. This matter has no different meanings. If so, is the first explanation a separate meaning outside the sectional text? Therefore the second explanation matches the sectional divisions. Following the four-section meaning increasingly matches. The four-section meaning makes the text "manifesting these words etc." the text producing the substance of refutation.

"Like those Nyāyamukha cause-gates etc." - Dao says: Cause-gates refers to places in the Yogācāra treatise etc. that explain the principles of hetuvidyā [etc.].

The continued commentary's final text says: ○ Having complete extensive wonderful discourse. [Above is the original commentary's final text]

Shao says: Though promoting the dharma assembly, earthen feelings are difficult to adorn. Recklessly receiving due to this, having no way to seal words. At the teacher's place, once obtained half a pearl. Due to lacking conditions, not yet receiving the complete treasure. Due to the occasion of teaching and guiding children, raising fireflies to assist the sun's light. The textual principles of right and wrong within, may the wise kindly make detailed determinations [text].

The manuscript copy says:
On the fourth day of the eighth month of Jōkyū 2 (1220), at the hour of the rooster, copied this at Kakuin Kezō-bō and completed. Due to no leisure for examining texts and exploring deep meanings, roughly recording momentary understanding. Mostly ignorant and dark speculation only. Certainly there must be violations against ancient sages and departures from proper tracks. Should be examined and determined later.

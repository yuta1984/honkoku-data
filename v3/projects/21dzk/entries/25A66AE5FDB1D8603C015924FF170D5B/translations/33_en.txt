The answer's intention says: Regarding all created things, seeing them all as impermanent and stating so, when raising examples, through combination (合) one already proves that impermanence exists in that sound, making the opponent jointly accept it. Therefore, the thesis-predicate on the example uses that impermanence as its basis. Hence there is no other's one-sided basis non-establishment in the example.

"It is not the same as raising the reason being unestablished because not yet perfected" means: When previously raising only the reason, it has not yet established that impermanence exists in that sound. When raising the example, it then makes the existence of impermanence in sound established. Zhou says: "Once the combination is raised, the predicate becomes established and the example can depend on the predicate. Though the reason has been raised, since the predicate is not yet established, it cannot depend on the predicate" [etc.].

"If so, what about raising the reason, etc." means, the commentary says: Zhou says: "If after raising the reason, the opponent immediately understands the predicate, does the reason depend on the predicate or not?" [etc.]. This concerns: since raising the example makes the predicate established, the example makes the predicate its basis. If so, when raising the reason and the predicate becomes established, should the reason make the predicate its basis? This is indeed what was indicated by "as previously challenged" - the challenge of reason-example correspondence.

"Answer: Also cannot be the same as examples, first because of non-combination" means, the commentary says: "It is necessary to first combine, then depend on the predicate to raise the same [example]. Because not yet combined, one cannot depend on the predicate" [etc.]. The essence of this answer is: even if raising the reason makes the predicate established, as long as the combination methodology is not yet required, since the three members are not yet connected, the reason cannot depend on the predicate. But the combination methodology necessarily also raises and combines the example. Only after combination can the example depend on the predicate. Through the power of the example, it first achieves dependence correspondence.

"Also, sometimes raising the reason has non-understanding" - are there two explanations in the answer? Is this the second explanation? This explanation's intention says: Regardless of which opponent, when only raising the reason without yet raising the example, there must definitely be non-understanding. Not seeing the ultimate limit, regarding the thesis-doctrine it definitely cannot be clear. Therefore when raising the reason, though there may be a portion understanding the predicate, still the reason should not depend on the predicate [so to speak].

"If so, how about non-understanding when raising examples" means, the commentary says: Zhou says: "If one says raising examples to understand the thesis means the example depends on the predicate, when raising examples without understanding, what does the example depend on?" There is no further answer to this. Because of this obstruction, the explanation below is considered correct [etc.]. Those who don't understand - first saying: this is the explanation of depending on basis.

"Speaking meticulously, there are self, other, joint, etc." means, the commentary says: "Self thesis-predicate non-establishment, other thesis-predicate non-establishment, joint thesis-predicate non-establishment, self complete-part thesis-predicate non-establishment, other complete-part thesis-predicate non-establishment, joint complete-part thesis-predicate non-establishment, etc., should be understood accordingly" [etc.].

If one says like a pot having both non-establishment, etc., below

"Empty space having no substance also does not establish both" explains the both non-establishment of non-existence. When confronting the no-space theory, empty space has no substance. Because there is no substance, neither thesis nor reason can be established [so to speak].

"Though existence and non-existence are two, both are completely absent" concludes the both non-establishment of two types. The pot's substantial existence,

space's non-substantial existence. Though the two examples are different, both completely lack probans and thesis-predicate [so to speak].

"The Nyāyamukha raises the basis of existence-examples" means: The Nyāyamukha only explains the both non-establishment of existence, not the both non-establishment of non-existence [so to speak]. The commentary says: "The intention says: In the Nyāyamukha, it only raises the basis both non-establishment of existence-examples, not explaining the both non-establishment of non-existence-example basis. Therefore the Nyāyamukha says: 'Like establishing sound as permanent, because of no contact.' The positive example says 'All things without contact are seen to be permanent, like karma, like atoms, like pots, etc.'" [etc.]. These three types of examples separately correspond to thesis-predicate non-establishment, probans non-establishment, and both non-establishment respectively. The Vaiśeṣika school's karma is non-obstructed but not permanent. Established atoms are permanent but not non-obstructed. Pots etc. are not permanent and also not non-obstructed. Both fail to establish thesis and reason.

"Both mutual and one-sided [...] all briefly unexplained" means, the commentary says: "The intention says: In the Nyāyamukha, the four non-establishments of examples and the both non-establishment of non-existence are all briefly unexplained" [etc.].

"According to this, existence and non-existence [...] namely the third fault" means, the commentary says: Bei says: "This text is very difficult. However, now provisionally saying 'existence namely the first two' refers to both mutual and one-sided. 'Non-existence namely the fourth' refers to the fourth basis non-establishment. 'Sometimes existence sometimes non-existence' refers to the third uncertain non-establishment" [etc.].

"In this there are four sentences, etc." - "this" refers to both non-establishment. Regarding both non-establishment there are four sentences [so to speak]. In this, substantial existence and non-substantial existence means: calling commonly accepted statements substantial existence, calling non-commonly accepted statements non-substantial existence.

"Four thesis-reason non-substantial [...] no-space theorist" means, the commentary says: "Like when Sāṃkhya masters establish 'thought is self' against no-space theorists, because of experiencing the twenty-three principles, just like empty space."

[Lower Section]

The thesis-predicate self thesis, the probans twenty-three principles reason, being non-commonly accepted statements, hence called "thesis-reason non-substantial." Also the empty space example, being non-commonly accepted statements, hence called non-existent. Not establishing thesis-reason, therefore called both non-establishment [etc.].

"However, this has both mutual [...] basis non-establishment" - this statement refers to the current both non-establishment. Namely: both mutual's both non-establishment, one-sided's both non-establishment, uncertain's both non-establishment, basis's both non-establishment. Having divided probans non-establishment and thesis-predicate non-establishment into four non-establishments each, now both non-establishment also divides into four non-establishments.

"The first three each divide into two: existence and non-existence" - does calling both mutual, self one-sided, and other one-sided "the first three"? Regarding these three types, opening existence and non-existence into two. Namely: both mutual has two [existence both non-establishment's both mutual non-establishment, non-existence both non-establishment both mutual non-establishment], self one-sided has two [existence both's self one-sided non-establishment, non-existence both's self one-sided non-establishment], other one-sided has two [existence both's other one-sided non-establishment, non-existence both's other one-sided non-establishment].

[One character indent]
Question: Regarding uncertain and basis, why not open existence and non-existence? Answer: Uncertain is necessarily existence. Basis is necessarily non-existence. Because each is limited, they cannot open into existence and non-existence. Therefore in existence both non-establishment, basis non-establishment is rare; in non-existence both non-establishment, uncertain non-establishment is rare. Therefore seeing the next text, "Provisionally depending on existence both non-establishment, etc." is the section describing the four non-establishments of existence both non-establishment. But saying "existence both non-establishment basis non-establishment" - since the example basis already exists, this sentence is missing [etc.]. This is the existence both non-

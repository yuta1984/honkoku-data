Private Commentary on the Great Commentary of Hetuvidyā [Middle Volume] [Stored at Kasuga Hetuvidyā Hall]

The ancient masters of heterodox schools established two additional members of application and conclusion. [Outside the three members, they explained two additional members as separate entities. Therefore this is incorrect.]
Sound is impermanent. The reason states: because of being produced. The positive example states: like pots, etc. The negative example states:
[Note: "non" is probably the character for "like"] not like space. Sound is also thus. [Application member]. Therefore sound is impermanent. [Conclusion member].
In the orthodox teaching of Dignāga and others, application and conclusion [are included within examples. The application and conclusion described in Abhidharma texts etc. have this meaning.]
All produced things are impermanent [naritomiyo]. Like pots, etc. The words "all" and "everything" constitute application and conclusion. The word "all" is application. The word "everything" is conclusion.

Regarding this matter, the Commentary by Dingbin on the Treatise on Logic [Volume 4] explains it in detail. [Note: From "heterodox schools" down to "explains it" - 121 characters]

Question: "Why are the same and different [categories] of the thesis called 'categories'" etc. First, the question's meaning: Why do the above texts explaining "thesis same-categories" and "thesis different-categories" all use the word "categories"? [In the texts above "first, same dharma" etc., all use the word "categories." Those all concern same-different of thesis. The meaning is as before.] Now in texts explaining "cause same-categories" and "cause different-categories," why is only "dharma" used? There are three explanations in the answer. The first explanation's main point: Judging same-different in relation to thesis concerns the general thesis-dharma of inseparable nature. This contains many varieties. That is, when first taking impermanence as thesis with mutual distinctions, those various meanings of emptiness, no-self, etc., are all likewise collaterally of inseparable nature. Taking these as examples, the various types of meanings on pots are also

like this. Since there are already many category-varieties, when examples judge same-different in relation to thesis, all use the word "categories." Cause is the single meaning of "being produced" on the subject. Since this is just one dharma on the subject, when judging same-different in relation to it, examples are called "dharma" [meaning]. The second explanation's main point: Thesis is established as the totality of the many dharmas of cause and example. Therefore it gains the name "category." Since thesis gains the name "category," when judging same-different in relation to it, it gives the name "category." Cause is not established as the totality of many dharmas of cause and example. Therefore it doesn't gain the name "category." It is just called "dharma." Therefore judging same-different in relation to it is called "dharma." Cause is what establishes, thesis is what is established. Their meanings differ [meaning].

The third explanation's main point: The earlier text "first, same dharma; second, different dharma" does not explain same-different of cause. It explains same-different of thesis. Therefore the present question misses the text's meaning. In the following text, there is text explaining same-different of cause. Therefore the upper text only explains same-different of thesis, the lower text only explains same-different of cause. The present text applies to both thesis and cause same-different. Regarding the distinction between dharma and categories: what applies to being called "dharma" is when thesis and cause are complete and can generate understanding in others. When combining them, the meaning of guidance and maintenance is complete. Therefore it is called "dharma." Just raising thesis alone or just raising cause alone cannot generate understanding in others. Since there is no meaning of guidance and maintenance, those types are each called "categories" and cannot be called "dharma." The present upper and lower texts explain the word "categories" [meaning]. Question: What evidence does the third explanation have that the present text applies to same-different of both thesis and cause? Answer: The text "same dharma - if at this place displaying definite existence of cause same-categories" undisputedly applies to both cause-same and thesis-same. "Displaying cause same-categories" refers to cause-same. "Definite existence" refers to displaying thesis-

same. This text's main meaning says: Explaining cause-same and determining the nature of thesis-accomplished following is called "same dharma" [meaning]. [The above is the purport of back-writings etc.] Regarding "because of same dharma" etc.: These three reasons should be matched with the above three explanations in reverse order. Detailed meanings are in the Bright Lamp Commentary.

Question: What is the meaning of application and conclusion? Answer: Application is the method of joining. It joins cause first to positive examples. Conclusion means this method of joining - after joining to positive examples it is called conclusion. Therefore application extends through the three members, conclusion extends through the three members. However, discussing their primary locations: joining thesis and cause is called application, properly joining to examples should be called conclusion. Generally, the two members of application and conclusion are specifically established by ancient masters. Because they maintain cause and example as separate entities, they additionally establish what now joins and concludes them. What this commentary discusses differs from ancient masters' establishments because it does not separate from cause and example. After Dignāga, though still explaining application and conclusion, the manner of explanation changed. Also, ancient masters do not explain the methods of joining and separation. Though explaining joining and separation, it does not resemble orthodox methods? [The differences in application-conclusion between new and ancient masters are on the cover sheet.]

"Then indefinite causes should also become causes" etc. Since ancient masters already took the first characteristic as cause without knowing the later two characteristics, why not challenge that contradictory causes could also be correct causes?

Answer: First raising indefinite cause as a challenge to make known that contradictory causes should also be so, therefore the concluding text says "because lacking the latter two characteristics." The ancient counter-challenge "How can there be..." etc. - this ancient counter-challenge's meaning, regarding the above challenge: if only cause-essence pervading thesis-dharma is cause, then indefinite cause should also be correct cause - this is the counter-challenge. That is, cause-example [...] example follows and establishes, different example stops confusion [...]

[Lower Section]
[...] pot has established impermanence [...] this contrary existence is also here unknown [...] thesis-dharma productive cause only operates in same-categories, should not operate [...] pot has productive impermanence therefore space universally lacks this meaning, therefore this is [...] cause. Since indefinite cause is not like this, how does it become correct cause? One cause [...] placing each separately, genuine and false already determined, why does this cause's separate entity have indefinite faults in two examples [meaning]?

Dignāga's challenge states: "If at that time [up to] necessarily universal absence from different [categories] is correct cause." Dignāga's meaning: When establishing inference, regarding different categories of what the thesis establishes, there are cases where that cause is not of one type. This becomes the fault of partial operation indefiniteness. Among the nine sentences, the third and ninth sentences are these. But if as you ancient masters say, cause and example are definitely separate entities, such indefinite faults could not exist. Why? Since they are already separate things, they are not mutually penetrating entities. One should just follow intention: in same-categories take the meaning of existence from among existence/non-existence, in different-categories take the meaning of non-existence from among existence/non-existence, and these can be same-different categories in relation to cause. When knowing they penetrate, one cannot follow intention. Example-entity is identical to cause-meaning; wherever cause-meaning-principle reaches, whether same or different, all can operate. Therefore on days of maintaining separate entities one can follow intention. Since they are separate things of here and there, there can be no inevitable principle-path. Since it is already thus, if cause and example are separate, then taking the third and ninth sentences as indefinite would not be established. But since they are already taken as indefinite, clearly know that cause and example are not separate entities. Example-entity is identical to cause's latter

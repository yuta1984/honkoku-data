This is the reason for not explaining the [latter four] faults. There are two interpretations here. The intent of the first interpretation: Hetucakra, wanting to explain as thesis what is established and not refuted as contradicting direct perception etc., explains those faults. It only raises the five such as contradiction with direct perception. The latter four types are already not contradictions, so they are omitted. The Master of Heaven (Kuiji) wanted to show that thesis faults are not only contradictions, so he fully presents nine types [meaning]. The intent of the commentary: The three faults of capable-recipient-both in Hetucakra are explained within cause-example. Because they belong to uncommon establishment, they are not explained separately. Mutual agreement is originally not thesis. Therefore it is not sufficient to be a fault [meaning]. The Master of Heaven's addition of "incapable part non-establishment" and below - that intent is easy to understand.

"Hetucakra saying thesis etc. multi-word explanation means of proof etc." - Hetucakra itself does not particularly reject thesis as means of proof. The meaning is: within the thesis etc. multi-word means of proof explained in Hetucakra, Yogācāra, etc., following one's own preference, what is to be established is explained as thesis [meaning]. Therefore in Hetucakra, thesis is what is to be established.

Incapable part non-establishment is precisely the uncommon indefinite etc. within cause. Uncommon indefinite is the fault of cause lacking same-different two classes. Moreover, same-different two classes are determined in relation to the capable part. Because the capable part is not established, there is no capable part. Because there is no capable part, same-different consequently lack. Because same-different lack, cause also lacks two classes. Therefore it immediately becomes uncommon indefinite. Established part non-establishment etc. can be understood by analogy. Regarding "basis not extremely [established]" etc., Collected Records says: Regarding the commentary's "If these three above... what is called established," there is a commentary below. The basis of capable-recipient-both is not extremely [established] [marginal note: meaning of non-extreme establishment]. Since [考note: "text" is probably missing "not" character or missing "saying" character] it is necessary to establish the dependent thesis-dharma. Therefore it does not establish. Since thesis already does not establish, what is called established? Through this it is necessary that capable-incapable parts be

both extremely established [Ying same, etc.].

Criticizing the fault of ancient masters' thesis-cause contradiction.
[End indentation]

First, the ancient masters' cited thesis-cause contradiction methodology says: Heretics establish a syllogism saying: "Sound is permanent. Because all are impermanent" [etc.]. Ancient masters consider this a thesis contradiction fault. That is, a thesis fault. Now Dignāga's correct doctrine criticizes this, meaning: First, this methodology wrongly presents negative methodology. That is, the heretics' correct syllogism says: "Sound is permanent. Because it is not all. Same example like space. Different example like pot etc." [Heretics say: Having many categories of dharmas is impermanent. Otherwise it is permanent. Now "not all" means having no categories. Conversely one should know: now "all" also means having categories. This should be understood.] That is, combination methodology says: "All things that are not all are permanent. Like space." That is, one should present negative methodology saying: "All permanent things are all. [考note: "like" is probably superfluous] Like pot etc." Therefore the heretics' current syllogism, if stated correctly, should be like this. Therefore the ancient masters' cited methodology wrongly presents negative methodology. It should not be considered a thesis fault [meaning]. The commentary saying "Because all are impermanent is example [...] how can one establish a permanent thesis with the cause that all are impermanent" - this is that meaning. Saying "is example" and "this example" means different example. This means different-dharma negative methodology.

Also saying "This cause is not existent... different dharma's impermanence meaning" - within this there are three stages. First: hypothetically following what the ancient masters cite, taking "because all are impermanent" as cause to examine faults. That is, both sides non-establishment. This can be understood from the text. Second: correctly taking "because not all" as cause to examine faults. That is, one side non-establishment. [Sound having no categories is what heretics now assert. Inner path says "sound has many dharma categories."]

Third: not taking "all are impermanent" as cause, correctly examining faults as negative methodology. That is, the fault of inverted negation. That is, in negation, the custom is necessarily thesis first, cause after. If this order is inverted, it is called inverted negation fault. And now having all-cause first and impermanence-thesis after. Therefore this is inverted negation fault. That is, this is a different example fault. Therefore generally this should be cause-example fault. Thesis-cause contradiction is not a thesis fault [meaning].

"Two prior excellences" are the two treatises of Vasubandhu and Dignāga.
"Four sentences' capability" - perhaps the four sentences among the seven types of treatise essence etc.? As indicated above.

Six Causes General Outline
[End indentation]

Producing cause [The proponent's words and cognition, and the meaning indicated. Produces the opponent-witness's cognition. Like seed producing sprout. Therefore called producing cause]. This has three types: Word producing cause. Meaning producing cause. Cognition producing cause.

Understanding cause [The opponent's cognition and proponent's words, and the meaning indicated. Illuminates the fruit of thesis etc. Like lamp producing flame. Therefore called understanding cause]. This has three types: Cognition understanding cause. Word understanding cause. Meaning understanding cause.

Word producing cause [The proponent establishing cause-words. Because it draws forth the opponent-witness's decisive cognition, it is called word producing cause].

Meaning producing cause [The meaning indicated by the proponent's words. Calling this producing cause has two interpretations. First: Being what word producing cause indicates, it is called producing cause. Second: As object it can produce opponent's understanding. Therefore called producing cause].

Cognition producing cause [The cognition by which the proponent utters words. This has two interpretations. First: Being the cause of word producing cause, it is called producing cause. Second: Remotely producing others' understanding, therefore called producing cause. The commentary master takes the first interpretation].

Cognition understanding cause [The cognition by which opponent-witness understands means of proof words and understands what is to be established. Saying understanding cause cognition and understanding thesis cognition - this also has two meanings].

Word understanding cause [The proponent's means of proof words. The essence is the same as word producing cause. However, now calling it understanding cause has two meanings. First: Through cause-words understanding the explained meaning. Therefore called understanding cause. Second: Cause of understanding cognition cause.

Therefore called understanding cause. The commentary master agrees with the latter meaning].

Meaning understanding cause [The meaning indicated by the proponent's words. The essence is the same as meaning producing cause. However, now calling it understanding cause has two interpretations. First: Meanings such as being produced can clearly reveal thesis such as impermanence. Therefore called understanding cause. Second: Object of cognition

understanding cause. Therefore called understanding cause. The commentary master agrees with this].

Within this "thesis etc. multi-words called means of proof" below [eight character space] verse
The sequence clarified in prose, opening-combining not the same. Harmonizing three interpretations.
[End indentation]

In the first interpretation, "Seeking their characteristics [...] verses because true-fallacious each separate [...] essence-categories having sameness" etc. Bright Lamp Commentary says: The principle of eight meanings has depth and shallowness. Deep principle is called nature. Shallow principle is called characteristic. The six sections of prose should be allocated as follows. First true establishment is deep, therefore called nature. Second fallacious establishment is shallow, therefore called characteristic. [...]. Fifth true refutation called nature. Sixth fallacious refutation is shallow, therefore called characteristic. Deep-true shallow-fallacious, explained in mutual opposition. Therefore there are six sections. Also, meaning convenience is nature, textual convenience is characteristic. Following textual-meaning convenience, combining to make six sections. Therefore saying "seeking characteristics." "Essence-categories having sameness" means: true perception true inference have separate essence, same category. Perception-inference each separate. Therefore called separate essence. Though individual essence differs, both are cognition. Therefore called same category. Fallacious perception fallacious inference have separate categories, same essence. Though two categories differ, both are equally non-valid cognition. Therefore called same essence. True-fallacious two levels each separately opened should have eight gates. Two true cognitions: through their category sameness... Two fallacious cognitions: through their essence sameness... Generally completing six sections [etc.].

In the second interpretation, "Though knowing true-fallacious two understandings different, revealing to witnesses both belong to understanding others." The commentary's above text interpreting eight gates says below: "This verse is based on the majority all enlightening witnesses, saying only understanding

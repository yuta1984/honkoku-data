This refers to the latter two characteristics. What is this meaning? When it is understood that cause and example are of the same essence, whether in different categories or same categories, within the scope where cause-meaning exists, that cause necessarily operates in all cases. Such faults arise for this reason. It says "then this indefiniteness exists." "Then indefiniteness exists" means that even before the ancient masters' doctrine, what they ultimately fell into establishing requires accepting this partial-operation indefiniteness. Since it must definitely be accepted, the meaning of cause and example being of the same essence is thereby established - this is the purport. "Then that fault does not exist" means when speaking of cause and example being of the same essence, then there is no difficulty as before [meaning]. "Those two threes, etc." refers to the third of the first three and the third of the latter three among the nine sentences, called "two individual threes." [This matter is not yet clear. Based on the current session's deliberation, I have recorded the general purport.]

Therefore, in examples, cause and thesis are presented together, etc. This is because separation and combination exist in the example-place. Reverse combination, reverse separation, etc., are all example-faults. Therefore in the present text, cause and thesis are presented and combined within examples [meaning]. The ancient masters' doctrine is not like this.

"Different dharma - if at this place" etc. below

Regarding "there is an interpretation" etc. - this is Master Wengui. Regarding "again self-challenges saying" etc. - this is that master's self-challenge. Regarding "if so, sound is impermanent" etc. - the commentary master explains and reveals the meaning of that self-challenge. Regarding "therefore it should be said" etc. - this is the commentary master's orthodox position. Regarding the question "why does the established not say 'universally absent'" etc. - this is a question about the treatise text. Because below "established absent" there is no word "universally."

"Like existence and non-existence being called non-existence" below

Regarding "generally speaking, 'non-existence' briefly has two meanings" etc. - this is the meaning within the second explanation. [Since separate explanations have no complications, I abbreviate them.] One

examination says: "First, Vaiśeṣika excluding existence, the five categories are all non-existence" etc. corresponds to the treatise's "like the words of non-existence." That is, the Vaiśeṣika masters, excluding great existence, call the remaining five categories "non-existence" - since the actually existing five categories are called "non-existence," this is non-existence that has referents. The treatise's words "like non-existence" correspond to this type [meaning]. "Second, non-existence is merely non-existence and has no referents" corresponds to the treatise's "like the word existence." That is, when Vaiśeṣika masters negate great existence and make contradictions to establish non-existence, the word "non-existence" merely blocks great existence. Therefore it is non-existence without referents. The treatise's explanation of existence being called "non-existence" is this type [meaning]. Therefore, according to this explanation, the treatise text should be read as: "Like existence and non-existence being called non-existence." "Existence" means great existence. "Non-existence" means the remaining five categories. This existence and non-existence are simply called "non-existence." Among them, great existence being called "non-existence" is merely blocking non-existence. The five categories being called "non-existence" is affirmative non-existence. Positive examples should be like the non-existence of the five categories. Negative examples should be like the non-existence of great existence [meaning].

Question: Regarding the text "second, non-existence," if it is as in the present examination, this is already Dignāga's establishment - are these words of great existence's non-existence? "Non-great existence having no referents" is precisely Dignāga's words. If so, in the heart of this explanation, since the treatise text already contains Dignāga's non-existence, how can the commentary's标题 for this explanation say "these words of non-existence do not cite Dignāga's described non-existence"? Answer: That header text says "these words of non-existence" refers to the "existence" in the treatise's "like existence and non-existence." This non-existence is the non-existence of the five categories, therefore it is not Dignāga's teaching. This is the previous first explanation, where "like

existence and non-existence"'s non-existence is considered Dignāga's teaching. This second explanation is not so [meaning].

This meaning is the purport of the great commentary's back-writings.

One examination says: "First, Vaiśeṣika" [up to] "Second, non-existence" etc. - the treatise's words "like existence" contain these two meanings. "First, Vaiśeṣika" etc. - calling the five categories "non-existence" is non-existence with referents. [This examination is like the above meaning.] "Second, non-existence" etc. - this is not negating great existence's non-existence. It is just like saying "at that place this thing does not exist" - manifesting in absence and calling it "non-existence," therefore this is non-existence without referents. The treatise's words of "like existence and non-existence"'s "non-existence" jointly explain these two non-existences. The five categories' non-existence is like positive examples. The thing-absent non-existence is like negative examples [meaning]. The meaning of this doctrine is that the treatise's "like existence"'s word "existence" serves as a demonstrative word. According to this meaning, reading the treatise: "Like existence, explaining non-existence and calling it non-existence." This meaning remains as original [cursive character]. It does not cite Dignāga's described non-existence texts. Because the treatise text does not explain great existence's non-existence.

This meaning is the purport of Yi and others.

My examination says: "First, Vaiśeṣika" etc. wants to correspond to the treatise's words "like existence." The Vaiśeṣika masters' five categories being called "non-existence" - since they definitely have substantial non-existence, positive examples necessarily having referent example-supports is similar to this [meaning]. "Second, non-existence" etc. wants to correspond to the treatise's words "like non-existence." Thing-absent non-existence has no referents and merely blocks. Negative examples stop confusion, therefore they do not necessarily need example-supports - this is similar [meaning]. As evidence for real things being called "non-existence," Vaiśeṣika's five categories are most worthy of mention. As evidence for having no referents yet being called "non-existence," thing-absent non-existence should most be brought forth. Taking the commentary's "first" and "second" to correspond in order to the treatise's "like existence and non-existence" - would the doctrinal reasoning be quite harmonious? The treatise has no Dignāga's described contradictory non-existence, well fitting the general header text of "not citing Dignāga"? This foolish speculation, though not having seen the explanations of teacher-masters and previous worthies, received the teacher's judgment, therefore fearfully recorded it. Also seeing the Bright Lamp Commentary, there is no further contradiction.

Regarding "not universal, permanent residence, broad cause" - this is not taking non-permanence as broad cause. It means the broad cause of the permanent thesis. That is, the cause of non-exertion.

Regarding "impermanent cause broad, exerted thesis narrow" etc. - the original inference has exertion as cause and impermanence as thesis. However, now putting impermanence first and saying "all impermanent things are produced by exertion," impermanence becomes the establisher, therefore impermanence is called the cause. At this time exertion becomes what is established, therefore it is called the exertion thesis.

Regarding "this exertion cause already depending should say again not universal" etc. - because the production cause is broad and establishes all impermanence, the exertion cause is narrow and establishes partial impermanence. Therefore what the exertion cause accomplishes corresponds to one part of what the production cause accomplishes. Wanting to manifest this meaning, it says "this exertion cause already exists equally in production." Regarding "should say again not universal" etc. - since the two causes already have broad and narrow like this, the verse should necessarily include the word "again." ○It says "again not universal, non-pleasant" etc. The word "not universal" comes from the exertion cause. However, due to abbreviation, the character "again" is absent [meaning].

Regarding "that self-answers saying" etc. - the Treatise on Logic text generally has four answers. Regarding "if following correct principle" etc. - the

established [text]. The meaning of this is: [one] causal support means karmic cause. If cause and effect are lacking, victorious results cannot be achieved. If the present thesis-support is lacking, it is also like this [meaning]. According to this version, should the character "multitude" in "multitude supports" be written as "cause"? The original saying "victorious results" as "four supports" is probably a copying error.

"Among these, direct perception contradiction" [up to] "sound is not what is heard" below

Regarding "both not contradicting one part, such as Buddhist disciples," etc. - Question: Regarding using this inference as a method for "both not contradicting direct perception in one part," what is the meaning? Answer: This inference mentions the two-part objects of primordial nature and self, establishing that all can be transformed and impermanent. Now this thesis being established - the meaning of two-part impermanence - does not contradict the direct perception of the proponent, the Buddhist disciple. Buddhism originally does not teach primordial nature and divine self; whether assuming them constant or impermanent, there should be no contradiction. It also does not contradict the direct perception of the opponent Sāṅkhya. Although their teaching says that primordial nature and divine self are not impermanent, they do not say that this non-impermanent meaning is obtained through direct perception. Now establishing impermanence does not contradict their direct perception. If so, since regarding the impermanence meaning established for the two parts, on both the proponent and opponent sides, direct perception has no contradiction in one part respectively, therefore it serves as a method for the phrase "both not contradicting one part." The present inference, speaking from reality, is another's comparative inference by the theorist. It should properly place the words "what you maintain." This first demonstrating dharma and revealing directions, etc. - the meaning is: among these nine faults of thesis, first regarding direct perception contradiction, pointing to dharma. Therefore regarding the various comparative inferences mentioned, it does not explain having other faults. It tentatively explains one corner of direct perception contradiction. In presenting other faults below, such inferences are not without other faults [meaning].

"Comparative inference contradiction, etc." below

[Lower Section]

"Mahāyāna excluding Buddha's comparative inference knows existence," etc. [note: "excluding" in the commentary text is written as "removing"]. The Collected Records say: The Later Record says "Mahāyāna excluding Buddha" - "excluding" means removing [etc.]. Offering says: ○ Question: According to the Benevolent King Sutra, first-ground bodhisattvas and the Four Heavenly Kings equally illuminate the principle of two truths. Based on this, the bodhisattva's subsequently-attained two wisdoms can also use direct perception to cognize the seventh consciousness and eye-faculties, etc. Now this means Mahāyāna excluding Buddha also contradicts direct perception. How can it only be said to contradict others' comparative inference? Answer: In principle, even excluding Buddha, there are those with direct perception knowledge. This speaks generally, only saying "excluding Buddha." Among bodhisattvas, some are not [direct perception] [etc.].

"Some contradict shared one part, such as the Sphoṭa theorists," etc. - Question: That master teaches that only Sphoṭa sounds are permanent. What is this doctrine? Answer: That master's theory is that the phonemes taught in the four Sphoṭa treatises can designate all dharmas, and those sounds are permanently unchanging. Namely, even when not chanting those phrases, the designating sound-essence being taught is permanent. Excluding this, sounds outside the mind are impermanent [one] [meaning].

Question: If so, since the proponent's side has two parts of permanent and impermanent, it should be said to contradict one part of self. The opponent's Buddha-dharma [holds] all sounds are impermanent. Now establishing all as permanent, therefore regarding others it completely contradicts. Why say it contradicts shared one part? Answer: Regarding the opponent's side, tentatively following the meaning of obtaining permanent aggregates, Buddha's fruition sounds can be permanent. Therefore it becomes contradicting shared one part. This is the meaning of the Later Record cited in the Collected Records.

"Self-teaching contradiction, etc." below

Regarding "if not considering establishing whatever accomplished teaching" - the Collected Records say: The commentary's "if not considering ○" - the Later Record

says: Following entry into another school to establish another school's doctrine, one must not contradict that other teaching. Question: Since it is already another's teaching, how can it be called "self"? Answer: Looking toward one's own comparative inference teaching, following that inference it gains the name "self." Actually it is another's teaching [text]. Now examining this meaning, it is not the usual case of others' comparative inference contradicting others. Namely, to well know the path of others' doctrines, in order to refute other schools, one studies their school, tentatively placing oneself in their teaching and establishing their doctrine. Like Vasubandhu's composition of the prose commentary to the Golden Seventy Treatise. At this time, since one already makes the other school one's own school, if establishing comparative inference to accomplish their doctrine contradicts the other teaching, it immediately becomes contradicting self-teaching. The present commentary text has this meaning.

"Some contradict self one-part teaching but not others," etc. - this takes complete contradiction as not being one-part contradiction. Since Sarvāstivāda says "all three times truly exist," the thesis that "three times do not exist" contradicts the opponent completely. "Some contradict others' one-part teaching but not self" - this takes complete non-contradiction as not being one-part contradiction. Since Mahīśāsaka says "nine unconditioned are all truly existent," the thesis that "nine unconditioned are all real" does not contradict the proponent completely.

[Their school's nine unconditioned are: cessation through analysis, cessation not through analysis, space, immobility, true-nature of good dharmas, true-nature of unwholesome dharmas, true-nature of morally neutral dharmas, true-nature of noble path factors, true-nature of dependent origination factors] "Some contradict shared one-part teaching," etc. - Question: "Coarse is conventional, subtle is real" is Sautrāntika doctrine. Sarvāstivādin masters [hold] both coarse and subtle are real. If so, regarding taking "coarse is not real, subtle truly exists," how is it that the present thesis "all are not truly existent" contradicts shared one part? Since before the opponent Sarvāstivādins it completely contradicts, how so? Answer: In Sarvāstivāda's implicit acceptance, there are conventional dharmas within form-sources. Pots, etc., are these. Therefore regarding the opponent's side, based on this doctrine it is said to contradict one part.

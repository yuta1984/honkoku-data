"If only eliminating non-theists [...] errors are also not exhausted" - though not reaching detailed explanation, if again only eliminating invalid cognition without eliminating inference, elimination is again not exhausted [meaning].
"Therefore these should be left" - exhaustively leaving all discriminations possessed by inference and invalid cognition, then becoming direct perception [meaning].

"Discriminations possessed by two or three" - the Mingdeng Commentary says: Two means self-nature discrimination and spontaneous discrimination. Three means the three of self-nature etc. [etc.]. Because there is direct perception among these discriminations.

"Following the inclusion of seven in three [...] because they constantly exist" - the Mingdeng Commentary says: Among the seven there is spontaneous. Among the three there is self-nature. In the mental ground, only excluding non-discriminative wisdom, in the remaining scattered mind, concentrated stages, and independently arising subsequent attainment wisdom stages, there are accordingly those two discriminations of spontaneous and self-nature etc. [etc.].

The text "Question: What hindrance is there in Nyāyamukha's meaning being different?" - the five consciousnesses depend on the five faculties and turn to the five objects. Called "manifest distinct turning." Therefore saying "meaning different"?

"These four types of mind, either only five consciousnesses [...] are two types of explanation" - the four types of mind are the five consciousnesses, five-accompanying mind, self-evidencing part, and concentrated mind mentioned above. Regarding these four minds, the matter of requiring the etymological explanation "called direct perception because of manifest distinct turning" should be addressed. This treatise and Nyāyamukha have comprehensive and specific aspects. Nyāyamukha consistently calls "manifest distinct turning" regarding the five consciousnesses [seen]. This treatise is either only about the five consciousnesses or comprehensively about the four parts - two explanations exist in the commentary [seen]. That is, above regarding this treatise's text "if correct cognition regarding meanings such as form

[Lower Section]

etc." there are two explanations about whether the four minds are included or not. The first explanation clarifies the five consciousnesses regarding the text "meanings such as form etc." [meaning]. This explanation should also say the text "manifest distinct turning" is limited to the five consciousnesses. The second explanation regarding the text "meanings such as form etc." broadly comprehends the four minds [meaning]. This explanation says the text "manifest distinct turning" comprehends the four minds [above]. The above text is like this.

However, seeing this one assumption, depending on the meaning of "manifest distinct turning" to explain the name "direct perception," there are altogether three explanations. "These four types of mind etc." is the first explanation. This explanation's meaning is: both "manifest" words belong to mind. Because direct perception mind's substance is not one, it says "manifest manifest." The words "distinct turning" are immediately this mind's aspect of turning to objects. Because each attaches to the object's substance and is difficult to penetrate through, it says "distinct turning." This explanation does not contradict either of the above two explanations. Both can include it. Therefore saying "these four types of mind, either only five consciousnesses etc." This explanation has both "manifest" and "measure" words belonging to mind. Therefore "manifest is immediately measure" - a karmadhāraya compound.

"Depending on Nyāyamukha saying 'because of not commonly relating etc.'" is the second explanation. This explanation, following Nyāyamukha, also limits this treatise's text "manifest distinct turning" to the five consciousnesses. It corresponds to the first explanation among the above two explanations. The meaning is: the first "manifest" calls the five faculties, the next "manifest" raises the five consciousnesses. That is, the five consciousnesses depending on the five faculties. Should say "manifest of manifest." Distinct turning means: the five consciousnesses depending on the five faculties distinctly turn to the five objects respectively, therefore saying "distinct turning" [meaning]. This explanation includes faculties and consciousnesses in the "manifest" of "direct perception"? Therefore taking the word "measure" in relation to "faculty-manifest," because it is "measure of manifest," it is tatpuruṣa compound. In relation to "consciousness-manifest," because "manifest is immediately measure," it is karmadhāraya compound. Because the word "measure" should definitely belong to mind.

[Upper Section]

"Or measure of manifest, the five faculties not being one etc." is the third explanation. This explanation also follows Nyāyamukha, limiting to the five consciousnesses. It still corresponds to the first explanation among the above two explanations. The meaning is: "manifest manifest" refers to the five faculties. Because the five faculties are not one, called "manifest manifest." Therefore "direct perception" - the "manifest" word belongs only to faculties, the "measure" word is also consciousness. Therefore "measure of manifest" - tatpuruṣa compound. Now, attached to the second explanation there is an objection. That is, saying "the five consciousnesses depending on the five faculties distinctly turning to the five objects respectively is called manifest distinct turning," therefore this meaning does not pervade the meaning of five-consciousness direct perception in mutual functioning positions. Therefore questioning "if so, mutual functioning is also distinct relating." The answer's meaning is so. In mutual functioning positions this meaning should not exist. Now provisionally depending on the meaning of not-yet-accomplished five-consciousness direct perception, making the explanation of manifest distinct turning [meaning]. Now this objection does not exist for the first explanation. Therefore saying "if depending on the previous explanation, immediately no such objection." It also does not exist for the third explanation. Therefore saying "in principle there is no contradiction." That the first explanation has no such objection is easy to know. That the third explanation has no such objection - regarding the text this is undetermined. Because there is no text explaining the words "distinct turning." Therefore regarding principle it is necessary. Therefore saying so. That principle is: if the third explanation should also have this objection, after stating the latter two explanations, then there should be this questioning and objection. Why does only the second explanation's bottom have it? Following this, the text "in principle there is no contradiction" in the third explanation - if not words removing objections, by what means would there be these words? It should not be words harmonizing Nyāyamukha and Pramāṇasamuccaya. Having already harmonized above, why redundantly have these words? Also the second explanation does not contradict Nyāyamukha. How could only the third explanation have these words? Also the first explanation does not contradict Nyāyamukha. Originally not contradicting the explanation of only five consciousnesses. How could

[Lower Section]

again only the third have these words? Therefore the text "in principle there is no contradiction" indisputably removes the objection of mutual functioning. The objection of mutual functioning exists only particularly in the second explanation. Considering this, the third explanation's words "distinct turning" do not say "the meaning of five objects being respectively distinct." Like the first explanation, it should only say "the meaning of each attaching to its own substance." Therefore there is no objection of mutual functioning.

Next "if comprehensively clarifying four etc." - attached to the meaning of tatpuruṣa compound, it reveals that among the four minds, the names of mental consciousness and self-evidencing part as direct perception are difficult to have. That is, the meaning of tatpuruṣa compound makes the "manifest" word belong particularly to faculties. Therefore the mental faculty [seventh consciousness] is not measure. How can one point to mental consciousness saying "measure of manifest"? Also the self-evidencing part does not separately depend on faculties to relate to the seeing part. How can one again say "measure of manifest" [meaning]? Because the meaning of tatpuruṣa compound is originally limited to the five consciousnesses, though it seems this explanation cannot be reached, it explains and exhausts the extent this meaning reaches.

"But following what should be depended on [investigation: in the great commentary 'zhi' is written as 'zhu'], karmadhāraya etc." - this generally concludes the two types of explanations of the three explanations. The first explanation is only karmadhāraya, the third explanation is only tatpuruṣa, the second explanation comprehends both tatpuruṣa and karmadhāraya. Therefore saying "accordingly."

The matter of arising from direct perception or arising from inference
[End of indentation]

In the sequential arising of cause and effect, are there three stages? [Considering based on the commentary text, this should be investigated.]

[Indented one character]
First, the stage of knowing the cause comprehends both direct and inferential perception. [Knowing smoke is direct perception, knowing production is inference.]

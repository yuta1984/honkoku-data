[Upper Section]
This is the first answer. Regarding "by completely manifesting two," etc. - this is where the commentary master explains the meaning of the first answer. The meaning is: the words of the two examples are completely presented [meaning]. Regarding "that again says," etc. - this is the second answer. Regarding "saying that among the two examples there are those already understanding the same," etc. - this is where the commentary master explains the meaning of the second answer. The meaning is: according to what is faced and understood, one is mutually presented [meaning].

Regarding "that treatise again says," etc. - this is the third answer. Regarding "or by analogical inference," etc. - this is the fourth answer. Regarding "sound means subject," etc. - this is where the commentary master explains the meaning of the third answer: for people who understand the two meanings, the two examples are not completely presented [meaning]. Regarding "or the proponent," etc. - this is where the commentary master explains the fourth meaning: explaining one to allow analogical inference [meaning]. Regarding "the above meaning explains," etc. - this concludes the four answers. "Or following the explanation of one" reconciles the second and fourth.

Regarding "having the word 'therefore' was previously absent" [up to] "previously in the pointing dharma, indicating two causes" - this refers to the text here about the nature of production or the nature of being produced through continuous exertion. Because there is no word "therefore" and two causes are mentioned. Regarding "answer: separately leaving thesis and cause, combining then leaves examples," etc. - when making the method of combination, leaving the example means that if one says "like a pot," then space becomes separated.

Question: If so, when making the method of separation, even when saying "like space," would the pot naturally be combined? Answer: Probably not. Because positive examples have both negation and affirmation, while negative examples only negate.

Regarding "answer: examples combine two dharmas," etc. - namely, positive examples combine the two dharmas of production and impermanence, negative examples combine the two dharmas of non-production and permanence. Therefore it is said that within negative examples, different thesis and different cause are generally included. Therefore they are not stated separately.

[Lower Section]
If the two of different thesis and different cause were stated separately, there could be faults. Because if the three members of different dharma were complete, it could establish other meanings. Because it would not conversely establish the original inference's establisher. Does "other meanings" mean not the opponent's doctrine? Or does it just mean different meanings?

"Only these three divisions are called establisher" below

Current examination says: Regarding the treatise text "only these three divisions, etc.," there are surface and depth meanings. The so-called surface meaning is: the three members are called "three divisions" and are called "establisher." In the sequence continuing from the text above, the meaning pointing to the three members is clear. This follows the purport of the ancient masters. The above text "among these, thesis, etc., many words" and the text "already explained thesis, etc., such many words" and below - all the commentary texts have this explanation. The surface of the present text is also that fusion [note: the character "fusion" is unclear; perhaps it should be read as "hori"]. Thesis, etc., are all called "establisher." The depth meaning is: the three characteristics of cause are called "three divisions," and it is said they are "called establisher." After Dignāga, cause-one and example-two are the establisher, excluding the thesis. Regarding this fusion [note: "fusion" is unclear; perhaps it means "tohori"], although the text above completely mentions the three members, it points to the true establisher among them - cause-one and example-two - calling them "these three divisions." The above "these thesis, etc." text and "already explained thesis, etc." text below also all have this explanation. The depth of the present text is also that division. Actually excluding the thesis, cause and example are the establisher. Therefore in the present text "only these three divisions," both three-members-three-divisions and three-characteristics-three-divisions are contained in surface and depth. Among them, the present commentary's explanation of this text takes the depth's actual division, explaining the three characteristics of cause as "only these three divisions are called establisher." This also has its reason. Namely, from this text above is the concluding text of the major section that finished explaining the characteristics of true establisher. Therefore it should most manifest the lord's actual

meaning and return to the meaning of cause and example as establisher. Therefore, looking at the commentary text, it first cites the three characteristics text from the Treatise on Logic, combining with this treatise saying "this is precisely here only mentioning three establishers" [etc.]. This greatly first establishes calling the three characteristics "three divisions." Next it cites the three members text from the Treatise on Logic, rejecting the establisher of outsiders' examination members, etc., and again combines with this treatise. Next it cites the ancient masters' doctrine, rejecting the establishers of eight, four, three, and again returns to this treatise. "Therefore it does not explain" [text]. Looking at the sequence of textual appearance, it ultimately concludes by explaining that only cause and example are the establisher. Stated again: from citing the three members text from the Treatise on Logic below, first taking one aspect to establish the three members as establisher, rejecting the coarse examination members, etc., as establishers, then correctly selecting cause-one and example-two, truly rejecting thesis, etc., as establishers. Therefore the Bright Lamp Commentary, seeing the commentary's main purport, explains based on cause-one and example-two. That commentary explains in detail - it should be examined. Therefore regarding "the word 'etc.'" - the above-cited text from the Treatise on Logic "remaining examination, etc." [etc.] points to this word "etc." The intention is actually to select from thesis, etc., as establishers and correctly take the three characteristics of cause, therefore outside of examination there is the word "etc." This is the bottom of the textual meaning. On the surface, after mentioning the three members, it says "besides these there are no other member divisions," being text that blocks other members outside the three members.

"Although desiring to establish, etc." below

Regarding "desire-for has two," etc. - current-time desire-for refers to the desire-for of various correct inferences. There is nothing more to establish, and when establishing inference it culminates in the three members, therefore it is called current-time desire-for. Later-time desire-for refers to the desire-for of various似-inferences. When establishing inference it does not culminate in the current-time three members, receiving faults and needing further accomplishment, therefore it is called later-time desire-for. Quasi-inferences are not without initial-time desire-for.

[Lower Section]
Unlike correct inferences that culminate at one time, after receiving faults, one must again establish inference and accomplish establishment. Wanting to manifest this fault of declining to later-time, it is specially called later-time desire-for. Among these two desire-fors, in the above explanation of true establisher, having finished clarifying the method of correct cause, although explaining what current-time desire-for accomplishes, it is not only this. Because there can also be theses contradicting direct perception, etc., there can also be quasi-thesis-establishments that are later-time desire-for [meaning]. Stated again: later-time desire-for is what the above commentary text calls "second-time inference" - this is it.

"Direct perception contradiction" [up to] "self-statement contradiction" below

Regarding "if following the concluding text," etc. - this points to the concluding text below: "such many words reject various dharmas" [up to] "establishing has no result." Following that text, the present text listing the nine faults of thesis has three divisions [meaning]. The commentary's sectional judgment of the text listing the nine faults of thesis generally has two sectional judgments: two divisions and three divisions. The texts cited below all tentatively follow the three-division doctrine in citing them.

"Subject-predicate not commonly accepted" [up to] "both not commonly accepted" below

Regarding "for example, four supports," etc. - this cites an analogy. [Another version says] "For example, if the four supports lack nothing, a victorious army can be formed. If the various supports are already empty, how can a victorious army be established?" [etc.] The original meaning of this is: the four supports are the four armies of elephants, horses, etc. If these are lacking, one cannot win in battle. If the present thesis-support is lacking, the thesis-doctrine cannot be accomplished - this is also similar [meaning].

Another version says: "For example, if the causal supports lack nothing, a victorious army can be formed. If the various supports are already empty, how can victorious results be

The beginning and end should correspond. Therefore, the joy in this chapter is the final joy. However, because the translator placed one chapter in the middle of the sūtra, other schools clung to this and generated different interpretations. The commentary master's "difficulty of assembly's joy contradicting emotions"—secretly exploring its reality, refuting difficulties is like pointing to one's palm. Among these, although this chapter describes entrustment, there is no separate teaching, and saying "heard the Buddha's teaching and all had great joy," the sequence doesn't correspond. Not only is there no such teaching, but also no basis for joy. If seeing the transformation bodies return to their original lands and having such thoughts, one should still feel regret and longing. Why instead have joy? Therefore, the Xuanzan states: "If not at the sūtra's end but provisional entrustment, why do the asuras and others have great joy arising so early? Since joy doesn't arise from hearing the Dharma jewel, this means seeing guest buddhas depart and comforting with joy deeply becomes strange." The assembly's joy contradicting emotions has deep meaning. It doesn't generally block other joys. Counter-arguments probably resemble reckless waves.

The sūtra states: "At that time Śākyamuni Buddha caused the transformation-body buddhas who came from the ten directions to each return to their original lands, saying these words: 'Let all buddhas each follow what brings them peace. May the Prabhūtaratna Buddha stupa return as before.' When speaking these words, the immeasurable transformation-body buddhas from the ten directions sitting on lion seats under jeweled trees, along with Prabhūtaratna Buddha, Viśiṣṭacāritra and other limitless asaṃkhyeya bodhisattva assemblies, Śāriputra, śrāvakas, four assemblies, and all worldly beings—gods, humans, asuras, etc.—hearing what the Buddha taught, all had great joy."

The Xuanzan states: "From the sūtra's 'when speaking these words' to 'great joy.' Commentary: The fourth major section where all assemblies rejoice. Hearing praise of the Dharma's excellence and the entrustment being thorough is the reason for joy. It's not joy from seeing the transformation buddhas being sent away. Based on this, the assembly should disperse." Bodhisattva Vasubandhu explained the "joyfully practiced" of the Gayāśīrṣa Sūtra with

three meanings: 1) Purity of the speaker—because of gaining mastery over all dharmas. 2) Purity of the taught Dharma—because of truly realizing and knowing the pure Dharma essence. 3) Purity of the fruits obtained from relying on the taught Dharma—because of attaining pure and wonderful realms. As the sūtra says: "All had great joy, faithfully received and practiced."

The same first [volume] states: "Difficulty of assembly's joy contradicting emotions. Also in the Entrustment chapter, transformation buddhas are made to return, but the stupa doesn't depart then. If not at the sūtra's end but provisional entrustment, why do asuras and others have great joy arising so early? Since joy doesn't arise from hearing the Dharma jewel, this means seeing guest buddhas depart and comforting with joy becomes deeply strange. This is simply because divine power was first released, thus manifesting pure land. Because this land is originally defiled, fearing Wonderful Sound might also see the defiled aspects of the original land and generate criticism, therefore breaking the precept. It's not that when Wonderful Sound arrives, the transformation bodies have already returned and the land is only defiled. Even in pure lands, still seeing Vulture Peak, conversely not only pure but also seeing defilement. Seeing above from below—why not permit this? With two buddhas sitting together, Wonderful Sound paying respect, Avalokiteśvara offering pearls and paying homage—presenting to these two transformation masters has special meaning, not extending to other buddhas. Just as in the Devadatta chapter, Mañjuśrī emerged from the dragon palace and alone paid homage to the two World-Honored Ones in the stupa. At this time the transformation bodies hadn't yet returned to their original lands. Mañjuśrī at that time generally didn't pay homage to the transformation bodies. Therefore know that the intention of paying homage is different. How can one make them universally pay homage by analogy? Therefore know that entrustment should be at the sūtra's end. Joyful practice all reside there."

Medicine King Chapter

Question: In the Lotus Sūtra Treatise, it clarifies three types of power including Dharma power. Can the power of practicing austerities within cultivation power be divided into two types of power?
Proceeding to say: The Xuanzan makes it two types of power. Regarding this, looking at the Lotus Sūtra Treatise, cultivation power has five gates. If practice power is two types, why not speak of six types of power? Moreover, if dividing the power of practicing austerities into two, the power of rescuing sentient beings from various difficulties should also be two types, because the two types of not-yet-awakened mind and already-awakened mind differ. How so?

Resolving: Regarding the power of practicing austerities, Bodhisattva Medicine King personally practices austerities, while Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound teaches and transforms sentient beings, causing them to practice austerities. Since self-transformation and teaching others already differ, why not divide into two types? Therefore the Xuanzan states: "Medicine King personally practices austerities with power to circulate; Wonderful Sound teaches and transforms sentient beings to practice austerities with power." However, regarding the treatise text, it actually seems not to divide into two types. ○ Yet looking at the Visible Practice Treatise, regarding supreme wonderful power it presents three types: Dharma power, sustaining power, cultivation power, listed in sequence. Cultivation power has five gates, taking the power of practicing austerities as one, pointing to the Medicine King and Wonderful Sound chapters. The Xuanzan first [states] wonderful power has only two types, not raising sustaining power. Regarding cultivation power it divides into seven types, including sustaining power among them. Also dividing the power of practicing austerities into self and other. The other three types are the same as the treatise's usual explanation. The Xuanzan's citation of the treatise is not in just one place. Above and below are all the same. If following the Visible Practice Treatise, the doubt and difficulty are indeed so. If following what the Xuanzan cites, austerities are naturally so. Without dispute, they are separate numbers.

Otherwise, cultivation power would only be six types, not seven. Therefore it's not a difficulty. Next, regarding the power of rescuing sentient beings from various difficulties: although the taught ones' not-yet-awakened mind and already-awakened mind differ, the teacher is the same, just rescuing and protecting sentient beings from difficulties. Regarding the power of practicing austerities: because Wonderful Sound teaches Dharma to encourage people, although the taught sentient beings practice austerities, Wonderful Sound hasn't yet shown the marks of austerities. Regarding Bodhisattva Medicine King: burning the body and burning the arms—difficult practice and austerities already differ from Wonderful Sound. Why not make them separate categories? Therefore it's not an analogous difficulty.

The Xuanzan states: "The coming intention: The above two chapters having clarified entrustment, the below six chapters receive the command to circulate. Based on the original treatise text, divide this into five: Medicine King uses the power of personally practicing austerities to circulate; Wonderful Sound teaches and transforms sentient beings using the power of practicing austerities to circulate; Avalokiteśvara and dhāraṇī use the power of protecting sentient beings from various difficulties to circulate; King Wonderful Adornment uses supreme merit power to circulate; Samantabhadra uses the power of entrustment and Dharma protection to circulate."

The treatise states:

Question: Regarding this chapter's title, how does the Great Master explain the words "original events"?
The Xuanzan states: "Original means causes and conditions. Events means substance and karma." Regarding this, "original" means past lives, "events" means causes and conditions. Because it clarifies this bodhisattva's past life causes and conditions, it becomes the chapter name. Why say "original means causes and conditions"? When he explains the title of the "King Wonderful Adornment's Original Events Chapter," [he states] "past life causes and conditions are called original events." Why is this not so here?

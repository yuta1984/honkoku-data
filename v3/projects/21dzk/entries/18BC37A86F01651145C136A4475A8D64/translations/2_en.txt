Response: The first interpretation states: "Buddha's wisdom is omniscient wisdom (種智). Tathāgata's wisdom is all-knowledge (一切智). These two are obtained naturally without teachers, so they are called natural wisdom." In meaning, wisdom (智) is a designation of decision. This is conditioned merit. Conditioned wisdom does not exceed two types. The name Tathāgata means "coming from suchness," most appropriately corresponding to fundamental wisdom. Besides this, Buddha's wisdom should be subsequently-attained wisdom. Buddha means awakening, and since awakening is a name for discrimination, it corresponds to subsequently-attained wisdom. Since there is no wisdom outside these two wisdoms, natural wisdom also has no separate essence. It repeatedly manifests the virtues of the previous two wisdoms. At the stage of Buddha's perfect fruition, there is no superiority or inferiority among buddhas of past and future, so Tathāgata's wisdom does not arise depending on others, hence called natural wisdom. Buddha is called "naturally obtaining precepts," etc. All causal stages follow teachers. Since bodhisattvas and śrāvakas are at lower stages, they have teachers present. Comparing Buddha to them, it's called natural wisdom. The latter interpretation states: "Or the first two are conditioned wisdom, the latter one is unconditioned wisdom, called natural attainment." Both wisdom and the place of wisdom are called wisdom. Wisdom-characteristics and wisdom-nature are both called wisdom. This is the main outline of this sūtra. "The buddhas' wisdom is profoundly deep and immeasurable" is called "證甚深 (certification profundity)" in treatises. The five types of profundity are divided into conditioned and unconditioned wisdom, explained in multiple layers. The four buddha-knowledges are made total-particular and simple-complex, explaining two types of principle-wisdom. The treasure-place nirvana are all buddha-wisdom. Since the first two types already explain the conditioned, they are further called natural wisdom. They should definitely be true principle. Since conditioned dharmas arise from conditions, they have no natural meaning. The unconditioned is permanently abiding with inherently congealed nature. The meaning of natural wisdom most appropriately corresponds to unconditioned wisdom.

In the commentary on the Principle Interest Chapter: "The sūtra states: 'All-knowledge... this is the bodhisattva sentence-meaning.' The praise states: 'This

[Lower section continues]
is precisely the sixth understanding of existence and emptiness. The wisdom that awakens and observes empty nature is called all-knowledge. This is authentic-essence wisdom. Within wisdom observing existence, this is divided into two: first, observing the undefiled path; second, observing remaining dharma-characteristics. Characteristics means the characteristics of distinctive differences. This is subsequently-attained wisdom. This wisdom observing the undefiled path is called path-characteristic wisdom. Observing remaining dharmas is called all-characteristic wisdom. Because all-seed wisdom is divided into two.'"

Question: Regarding the sūtra text "Tathāgata's wisdom, natural wisdom," which of the three wisdoms including path-characteristics does Tathāgata's wisdom represent? The praise says all-knowledge. Regarding this, all-knowledge is wisdom commonly attained by the three vehicles. Why call it Tathāgata's wisdom? Among the three wisdoms, it should be included in all-characteristic wisdom. Because it establishes unshared buddha-dharmas. Why say otherwise?

Response: All-knowledge differs in terminology across various teachings. One should understand its meaning according to the corresponding terminology. In the current Xuanzan, the sūtra's Buddha-wisdom is taken as omniscient wisdom. This is the Tathāgata's subsequently-attained wisdom. Tathāgata's wisdom is taken as all-knowledge. This is fundamental wisdom. Fundamental wisdom can certify the true nature of all dharmas. This is all-knowledge among the three wisdoms. Even though shared with the three vehicles, now taking Buddha's fundamental wisdom, why not call it Tathāgata's wisdom? The difficulty that it should be all-characteristic wisdom is not reasonable. The initial Buddha-wisdom is already subsequently-attained wisdom. How could this not be all-characteristic wisdom?

The Xuanzan states: "What can bestow Buddha-wisdom is omniscient wisdom. Tathāgata's wisdom is all-knowledge. These two wisdoms are obtained naturally without teachers, so they're called natural wisdom. Or the first two are conditioned wisdom, the latter one is unconditioned wisdom, called natural attainment."

The Suichō states: "Saying 'able to support the Buddha' explains giving Buddha's wisdom to sentient beings in the sūtra. Wisdom means subsequently-attained wisdom. Saying 'Tathāgata's wisdom, etc.' refers to fundamental wisdom. Saying 'these two are spontaneous, etc.' means these two are obtained without teachers. They're called natural wisdom. When not yet attained, cultivation is necessary. When the time of attainment arrives, they are obtained spontaneously. Called natural wisdom. This is not calling sitting upright without cultivation 'spontaneous.' Saying 'or the first two, etc.' is the second explanation. The first two are conditioned Buddha's wisdom and Tathāgata's wisdom. The latter one is unconditioned, called natural. These three are precisely the three of opening, showing, and awakening."

Xuanzan 8 states:

The same 5 states: "All-knowledge is wisdom observing emptiness. Buddha-wisdom commonly possessed by the three vehicles is wisdom observing existent phenomena, accomplished by Buddha alone. Because these two wisdoms arise from self-awakening, they're called natural wisdom. Because they don't wait for other conditions, they're called teacherless wisdom. Or wisdom-nature is called natural wisdom, wisdom-characteristics called teacherless wisdom. Seeking this knowledge and vision with retinue, powers, fearlessnesses, etc. as inner virtues, externally able to benefit beings with compassion, giving joy and benefit, removing suffering. The former is loving-kindness, the latter compassion. Vast understanding and practice is called the great vehicle."

Shōshaku 3: "Regarding the commentary's 'all-knowledge... commonly possessed by three vehicles.' Question: Three wisdoms being commonly possessed doesn't contradict reason. But saying 'observing emptiness' damages the sacred teaching. The Mahāprajñāpāramitā 363 states: 'The Buddha said: Subhuti, all-knowledge is the wisdom of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. Why?

[Lower section continues]
All-knowledge means the five aggregates, twelve sense-fields, and eighteen elements, which the two vehicles can also understand.' Based on these three categories being called 'all,' the wisdom that can know them is called all-knowledge. How can relating to the three categories be called 'observing emptiness'? Answer: This all-knowledge differs across teachings. The commentary raises one aspect, which also doesn't contradict."

Question: Regarding the sūtra text "the stupa of Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna should return as before," does this explain the meaning of Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna returning to his original land? Answer: Yes. Regarding this, Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna came for testimony. The transformation-body buddhas gathered to open the stupa. After the jeweled stupa closed its doors, all transformation bodies returned to their original lands. Since the sūtra explanation was not yet finished, Prabhūtaratna closed the doors but still remained. If so, "should return as before" reveals the meaning of the stupa closing its doors, not yet explaining the principle of returning to the original land. If explaining the characteristics of return, why not say like the transformation bodies that it should return to the original land? Other schools' brief examination specifically follows the sūtra text. How about this?

Response: Regarding the text "should return as before," both schools have disputes. At first glance it seems to hide the principle of permanently returning to the original land. The reasoning is not uniform. First, regarding transformation bodies returning and the great assembly dispersing, the sūtra clearly explains this. Regarding Prabhūtaratna returning to his original land, if the Encouragement chapter is taken as the end of the sūtra, that chapter should especially clarify this matter. Even if the Buddha doesn't encourage it, how could the compilers not record this matter? From this we know that the text "should return as before" in the Entrustment chapter precisely corresponds to that matter. If not so, when would the stupa return? Therefore the Xuanzan states: "From this point onward, there is no further place of return. Therefore we know this chapter should be at the end of the sūtra."

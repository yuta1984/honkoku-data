Neither in emptiness, nor in the ocean, nor entering between rock caves - there exists no other place where one can escape and not receive suffering. This also refers to the fixed karmic retribution of those who do not encounter Buddhas and bodhisattvas, do not arise minds of regret and remorse, and do not enter the path. Based on this, the *Karma Retribution Distinctions Sūtra* explains: If karma is created with an intensely focused mind, being shameless and without regret, and after creating it one creates more without a mind of reform and repentance, this karma is fixed. If karma is not created with an intensely focused mind, and although one creates evil karma, one constantly harbors shame and remorse, this karma is unfixed. One should simply know that if various karmas are neither repented nor subdued and damaged by the power of the path, there can be receiving of results, but if they are subdued and damaged, there is no principle of receiving results. However, when sūtras explain that Aṅgulimāla and arhats still received karmic results, at that time they were still dwelling in ordinary status, or were at the first or second fruit stages. Since they would definitely attain arhatship in this life, they were named according to the future, not named arhats at the time of receiving results. Also, even when encountering good conditions, it is essential to personally generate a mind of regret and remorse and enter the noble path for sinful karma to finally be eliminated. Even when encountering good conditions, if there is no mind of regret and remorse, one also does not enter sagehood. Even all Buddhas cannot transform it. The Śākya clan of Kapilavastu were killed because, although they attained the first fruit, individual retribution karma was not eliminated at the first fruit stage, and also because they had not heard the Mahāyāna with earnest regret and sincere deep mind, they received previous karma. If they had heard the Mahāyāna and deeply repented with encouragement and earnestness, they also would not have been killed, would have attained arhatship, and would not have received anything. Even if there were killings, it would not be due to karmic results. Otherwise, how could Aṅgulimāla, who killed people reaching a thousand with only one person lacking, attain sagehood? Also, if there were no regret and remorse and no subduing, cutting off, and extinguishing of various sinful karmas, sentient beings would have no period for receiving sagehood. Based on this, we know that the first explanation should be considered good, and accordance with the Nirvana and Yogācāra should be correct.

The *Eleven-Faced Sūtra* states: "I also do not see that with this divine mantra, according to wherever one dwells,

[Lower section]

whether far or near, after creating a boundary, there could be any who can cross over and come to cause harm. Only except for fixed evil karma that should ripen."

It also states: "World-Honored One, this divine mantra of mine has great awesome power. If recited once, it can immediately eliminate and extinguish the four root transgressions and the five heinous crimes, leaving nothing remaining. How much more so for those who practice according to the teaching."

Question: In the Xuanzan, the Yogācāra treatise is quoted: "Fixed karma to be experienced is established based on those not yet liberated." Then what stage is pointed to and called liberation? The Xuanzan states: "Speaking of liberation means from the worldly path's subduing and cutting off to attaining sagehood and becoming no-more-learning, etc." Regarding this, the conditioned worldly path has extremely inferior remedial power. How does it transform fixed karma that must be experienced? The Yogācāra's explanation of "already liberated" should definitely refer to the cutting-off path of the noble stages. Therefore, the master's *Abbreviated Compilation* interprets that passage with two explanations. One states: "From attaining liberation with remainder onward is called already liberated." Or "From attaining liberation without remainder onward is called already liberated." Based on this, using the conditioned paths of accumulation, preparation, etc., they belong to not yet liberated.

Answer: The Yogācāra treatise's discussion of the presence or absence of fixed karma by contrasting not yet liberated and already liberated can have multiple levels. Initially, completely not generating the path is called not yet liberated; generating worldly and transcendent remedial paths is called already liberated. Next, the two paths of worldly and transcendent are contrasted. Next, learning and no-more-learning are contrasted. Therefore the Xuanzan states: "Speaking of liberation means from the worldly path's subduing and cutting off to attaining sagehood and becoming no-more-learning, etc."

Taking the worldly path among these is because the three karmas of accumulation and preparation gradually and suddenly subdue the two obstructions. Since it is already called "the stage of diminishing power and increasing transformative capacity," how could there be no power to transform fixed karma? If not so, pre-ground bodhisattvas could not be born in pure lands. Know that the original treatise's meaning is that the meaning of already liberated extends to ordinary stages. The two interpretations in the Yogācāra commentary both discuss based on ultimate stages, which is the Xuanzan's meaning of "becoming no-more-learning, etc." There is no strong contradiction.

The Xuanzan states: "The sixtieth fascicle explains that fixed karma to be experienced is established based on those not yet liberated. Speaking of liberation means from the worldly path's subduing and cutting off to attaining sagehood and becoming no-more-learning, etc."

The *Mirror Water Commentary* states: "Saying 'the sixtieth explains, etc.' means three [levels] distinguish based on person. Based on not yet liberated, fixed karma is established. Based on already liberated, unfixed karma is established. The liberated ones are whether worldly path or uncontaminated path, whether cutting off or subduing, all are called liberation. Attaining sagehood - sages are learning and no-more-learning, namely arhats, etc. The two characters 'up to' include shame, remorse, and repentance." ■ states: "Those based on not yet liberated temporarily speak based on manifest characteristics. Regarding those based on definitely not yet liberated, there are also unfixed karmas."

Question: Regarding the principle of transforming fixed karma that must be experienced, can there be the principle of transforming fixed karma for those not yet entered into the incalculable eon stage? From both sides: if there were this principle, those not yet entered into the incalculable eon stage have not yet aroused worldly and transcendent paths. By what would they transform fixed karma? First and second fruit sages have already attained the noble path yet still cannot escape past evil. How much more so for ordinary beings who have not yet aroused [bodhicitta] mind? Therefore in the Nirvana Sūtra: "If one enters the Buddha Dharma, it is called unfixed karma." Does the stage of having already entered the Buddha Dharma correspond to having already aroused the mind? Based on this,

[Lower section]

interpreting the passage "fixed karma to be experienced is established based on those not yet liberated," it states "from the worldly path and subduing path onward is called already liberated." In the *Pivotal Essentials*, interpreting "diminishing power and increasing transformative capacity," there is the principle of transforming fixed karma. Know that before this there is no such principle. If so, then Mahāyāna repentance has inconceivable awesome power. Even for those who have not yet aroused the mind, if they repent with utmost sincerity, why would they not transform fixed karma? Among this, regarding Avalokiteśvara rescuing the difficulties of sentient beings who have not yet aroused the mind and causing them to be liberated from various sufferings, the Xuanzan's interpretation of the passage "if there are hundreds of thousands of millions of sentient beings experiencing various sufferings... all obtain liberation" takes the interpretation of "transforming fixed karma that must be experienced" as correct. Know that this permits sentient beings who have not yet aroused the mind to transform fixed karma. How is this?

I say privately: Whether those not yet entered into the incalculable eon can transform or not is difficult to determine easily. The Yogācāra dislikes "not yet liberated," the Nirvana Sūtra excludes "those not yet entered into Buddha Dharma." The treatise raises the superior while including the inferior; the sūtra expresses the initial while permitting the later. Regarding the entry stage in the sūtra text, there are also disputes. The general meaning corresponds to inner ordinary beings. Inner ordinary beings also extend to two interpretations. However, those who transform as stage characteristics should be from the incalculable eon onward, properly called "diminishing power and increasing transformative capacity." If discussing partial [transformation], why would there be none before this? Then the tenor of the Xuanzan's interpretation of this chapter is truly as inferred in the difficult questions. If one completely dislikes this, would one regret the difficulty of accessing the marvelous power of Mahāyāna in the final age?

The Xuanzan states: (As intended)

Question: The matter of transforming heavy [karma] to receive it lightly. The *Consciousness-Only Inquiry Commentary* in ten fascicles records this.
Question: Regarding the assignment and establishment of various karmas, there are many debates. Considering this a side discussion, [I] abbreviate it.

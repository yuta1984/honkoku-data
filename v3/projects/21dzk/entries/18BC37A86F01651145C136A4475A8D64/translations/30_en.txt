Even when dhāraṇī is accompanied by mental anger, and though wholesome mind has passed away, because it is still capable of retention, it is called "non-loss."

The Eiyō Commentary states: "Sometimes mind-associated" means that after cultivating and attaining this dhāraṇī, if it constantly arises together with mind, it is called "mind-associated." Even when not making mindfulness, it can still have function. Sometimes not making intention and not arising together with mind, therefore it is called "sometimes non-associated."

The Sōei Commentary states: "Sometimes mind-non-associated" etc. means that when first learning, making intention is called "associated." When naturally constant, it is called "non-associated."

The Mahāyāna Compendium Chapter Eleven on Dhāraṇī states: (Eon) Dhāraṇī, translated into Chinese is called "retention." Since this dharma does not perish, it is called retention. The distinctions of retention are not the same, having four kinds: first dharma dhāraṇī, second meaning dhāraṇī, third incantation dhāraṇī. Distinguishing differences regarding mind, as Nāgārjuna explained: all samādhi are only mind-associated. Various dhāraṇī are sometimes mind-associated, sometimes mind-non-associated. Intentional mindful retention is called "mind-associated." Even when arising anger etc., not forgetting what is retained is called "non-associated." "Associated" refers to essence. Saying "non-associated" distinguishes its power. Like retained transformative penetrating mind, though extinguished, still having transformative function.

Question: The sūtra text explains the merits of dhāraṇī. In that case, should dhāraṇī have explained meaning? The Xuanzan says "meaningless letters." Regarding this, all the Tathāgata's teachings have their meaning. As it says "all according to their meaning, universally turn the Dharma wheel." How can divine incantation verses be considered "meaningless letters"? Moreover, seeing the explanations of Bokuyo and other masters (Kajō), some explain causal practices and supreme fruition positions, others proclaim the names of powerful spirits and Three Jewels. If so, why are the Vedic teachings of non-Buddhists considered "meaningless letters"?

[Lower Section]

Response: "Brief, esoteric, meaningless letters" is not the commentary master's private words but the actual text of the Yogācārabhūmi. The Shōshaku states: "Capable of containing much meaning through brevity, moreover being esoteric. Observing those textual phrases, seeming meaningless is called 'meaningless words.' Not actually without meaning." Furthermore containing infinite meanings. Who could lack profound explained meaning?

Inquiry: The Yogācārabhūmi states: "Such incantation verses have absolutely no meaning. This is perfect accomplished reality." Returning to signless empty principle is called "meaningless." Or having no grasped object meaning, therefore called "meaningless." Why does the Shōshaku say "containing much meaning, moreover being esoteric, seeming meaningless"?

The Xuanzan states: (as above)

The Shōshaku states: The commentary's "brief, esoteric, meaningless letters" means capable of containing much meaning through brevity, moreover being esoteric. Observing those textual phrases, seeming meaningless is called "meaningless words." Not actually without meaning.

Question: By what is this clarified? Using little to encompass much - moreover, why does little contain much? Answer: Examining the Great Dharma Torch Dhāraṇī Sūtra, volume two, it states: "This one dharma phrase produces infinite phrases. This is great total retention, universally explaining all meanings. Why? Because wanting to make all sentient beings easily receive and understand."

It also states: Question: What do divine incantations explain? What dharmas do they indicate? Answer: According to one view, they don't go beyond three meanings: First, explaining supreme fruition merits or causal practices. Second, explaining Three Jewels names or names of powerful spirits. Third, explaining the profound principle of signlessness of all dharmas, making hearers awaken to the Way. Question: Why doesn't this region translate them but follows these sounds? Answer: According to one view, incantation language contains much; there is nothing in this realm to compare with it. If translated, the meaning would not be complete, and moreover one fears losing their power and function. Though there are said to be translators, they cannot yet be relied upon.

Question: In the Xuanzan it says "in order to attain dharma-meaning-eloquence-words unimpeded understanding." How does Master Bokuyo explain this? Answer: Two explanations are made. First: The commentary is mistaken. Eloquence and words are not total retention. Second: Not mistaken. Words unimpeded understanding is included in dharma total retention. Eloquence unimpeded extends to dharma and meaning, included within total retention.

Question: Both explanations are unclear. First regarding the first explanation: among the four unimpeded understandings, since dharma and meaning establish total retention, why not establish the two kinds of eloquence and words? According to this principle, the commentary text is not mistaken. Also regarding the second explanation: if eloquence-words two unimpeded understandings include dharma-meaning two kinds of total retention, one should say there are two total retentions. Why say there are four total retentions, saying "next explaining four"?

Response: Looking at the Shōshaku, citing the explanation: "Total retention has four, namely dharma, meaning, etc." What is cited as the basis takes the four kinds as the essence of total retention, without the character "for attaining." Therefore the first explanation considers the text mistaken. The latter explanation's meaning: though included within dharma and meaning, since the established names already have four, what fault is there in the commentary saying "total retention has four"?

[Lower Section]

Separately inquiring: Regarding the first explanation, looking at the commentary: "In order to attain dharma-meaning-words-eloquence four unimpeded understandings, accordingly explaining four total retentions." Raising the four unimpeded understandings refers to the fruition merits attained through dhāraṇī. It doesn't say "unimpeded is precisely total retention." Why say "eloquence and words are not the essence of total retention, considering the commentary text mistaken"?

Response: The Shōshaku's cited text differs from current editions as above. Even applying to the "for attaining" version, it still should not be so. Incantation total retention doesn't correspond to eloquence unimpeded understanding, and non-arising patience total retention also doesn't correspond to eloquence unimpeded understanding. Therefore it is probably an error.

The Shōshaku states: The commentary's "total retention has four, namely dharma, meaning, etc." - the four total retentions are: first dharma, second meaning, third incantation, fourth capable of attaining bodhisattva non-arising patience. What the commentary calls "eloquence and words" has two meanings. First, the commentary is mistaken, because eloquence and words are not total retention. Second, not mistaken: words unimpeded understanding is included in dharma total retention; eloquence unimpeded extends to dharma and meaning, included within total retention, therefore mentioning them.

The Ketchakuki states: Regarding the commentary's "total retention has four" - what are they? Question: Total retention has four: dharma, meaning, incantation, patience. How are these correlated with unimpeded understandings? Answer: Dharma-words unimpeded understanding is dhāraṇī. Meaning unimpeded understanding is meaning dhāraṇī. Eloquence unimpeded extends to the three dhāraṇī of dharma, meaning, and incantation.

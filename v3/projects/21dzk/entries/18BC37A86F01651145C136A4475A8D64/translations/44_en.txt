Master Cizu's commentary states: The Avatamsaka was taught before the Four Noble Truths. Why does the Immeasurable Meaning Sutra judge it as a third period teaching? If we say it is based on doctrinal classification rather than chronological sequence, the same applies to the Samdhinirmocana Sutra. Why doubt this alone? Therefore there is no contradiction.

Question: The sutra text states "I previously sat upright under the bodhi tree at the place of enlightenment for six years," etc. What does this explain?
Answer: Looking at the beginning and end of the sutra text: "I previously sat upright under the bodhi tree at the place of enlightenment for six years and attained anuttara-samyak-sambodhi," etc. Regarding this, examining the sutra text and inquiring into Sakyamuni's causal practices, the six years of ascetic practice came first, and sitting under the bodhi tree came later. How is this?
Answer: Relying on meaning rather than literal text is the established way of discussion. We should interpret the text according to the path of meaning: "Six years after I first sat upright under the bodhi tree at the place of enlightenment, I attained anuttara-samyak-sambodhi." There is no error.

Samantabhadra Sutra
Question: The sutra text states "Whether one sees Samantabhadra or does not see him, sins are eliminated," etc. What does this reveal?
Answer: It means that both people who see Samantabhadra's physical form and those who do not see him eliminate karmic obstacles. Regarding this, it makes sense that people who see Samantabhadra eliminate karmic obstacles, but how do those who do not see him eliminate karmic obstacles?

For example, those who do not recite [the name of] Avalokitesvara do not receive benefits. How is this?
Answer: Eliminating karmic obstacles is not limited to the single practice of seeing the Buddha. There are also reciting and chanting Mahayana sutras, or chanting the names of various Buddhas, etc. If so, even without seeing Samantabhadra's physical form, those who practice these acts and deeply and earnestly repent eliminate the suffering of sins, hence it says "those who do not see also eliminate sins."

Question: The sutra text states "Then afterwards one will obtain the revolving dharani," etc. What does this reveal?
Answer: It means that Samantabhadra practitioners obtain the revolving dharani. Regarding this, Samantabhadra practitioners are four good roots bodhisattvas, and the revolving dharani is obtained at the seventh ground. How is this?
Answer: Regarding the revolving dharani, if we discuss actual attainment, it is the seventh ground. Speaking of partial attainment, it extends to the pre-ground stage. Or perhaps at the pre-ground stage, through the power of cultivating Samantabhadra practices, one eventually reaches the seventh ground and obtains this merit?

Question: The sutra text states "treasure trees lofty and wonderful, five thousand yojanas [high]," etc. What does this reveal?
Answer: This text reveals that in the Buddha-land seen by Samantabhadra practitioners, the treasure trees are lofty and wonderful, five thousand yojanas high. Regarding this, what Samantabhadra practitioners (four good roots bodhisattvas) see - how could it reach five thousand yojanas? This is... How is this?

Answer: The earlier masters explained this matter with three explanations. First, they differ according to what is appropriate. Second, that refers to transformation Buddha-lands, while this refers to reward lands. Third, that transforms pure lands for those turning their minds [from Hinayana to Mahayana], while this manifests pure lands for those directly progressing [in Mahayana]. Therefore they are not the same. Although there are many explanations, we should temporarily rely on the meaning of the second explanation. Samantabhadra practitioners also include ground-entering bodhisattvas. Therefore it explains the characteristics of reward lands. This explanation should definitely be maintained. There are explanations in treatise texts.

Question: The sutra text states "immediately seeing all immeasurable worlds of the eastern direction," etc. What does this reveal?
Answer: It means that Samantabhadra practitioners see the immeasurable worlds of the eastern direction. Regarding this, Samantabhadra practitioners are four good roots bodhisattvas. They should only see one great thousand world system. Why speak of immeasurable worlds?
Answer: Truly, the extent of what they see through their own power should be as the objection states. That they now see immeasurable worlds depends on the empowering force of Bodhisattva Samantabhadra. Therefore the sutra states: "Due to Bodhisattva Samantabhadra's spiritual powers, he enables all sutra holders to see everything," etc.

Question: The sutra text states "they only see treasure ground, treasure seats, and treasure trees, but do not see the Buddhas," etc. Whose situation does this explain?
Answer: It explains that Samantabhadra practitioners do not see the Buddhas. Regarding this, examining Samantabhadra practitioners, their stage is at the four good roots and their virtue encompasses the six purities. Regarding the transforming [Buddhas] of the great thousand worlds, why would their knowledge and vision be obstructed? Moreover, since they already see treasure seats and treasure trees, why do they not see the Buddhas?

【Left Page, Lower Section】

How is this?
Answer: The matter of not seeing Buddhas means they practice repentance again to eliminate karmic obstacles, and later see the Buddha. Therefore the current sutra text explains not seeing through the Buddha's skillful means. In the lower text of the sutra, repentance and seeing are explained.

Question: The sutra text states "with hundreds of billions of immeasurable great bodhisattvas as retinue," etc. What does this reveal?
Answer: The meaning of this text is that the emanation Buddhas have immeasurable bodhisattvas as their retinue. Regarding this, looking at the Lotus Sutra text, it states "each leading one great bodhisattva to serve as attendant," etc. Why does this contradict that text by having immeasurable great bodhisattvas as retinue?
Answer: At the time of the Lotus Sutra, immeasurable emanations gathered. Although each led one great bodhisattva as attendant, because the emanations are immeasurable, it speaks of immeasurable bodhisattvas. It does not mean that one emanation Buddha comes with immeasurable bodhisattvas as retinue.

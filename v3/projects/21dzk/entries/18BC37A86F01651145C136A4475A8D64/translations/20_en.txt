"show and proclaim the cessation of suffering."

The sūtra states: "He addressed Bodhisattva Inexhaustible Intent: 'Good son, if there are immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of beings who experience various sufferings and afflictions, and they hear of this Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and single-mindedly call his name, then Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will immediately perceive their voices and they will all attain liberation.'"

It also states: "If there are hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of beings who, seeking treasures such as gold, silver, beryl, giant clamshell, carnelian, coral, amber, pearls, and other gems, enter the great ocean, and suppose black winds blow their ships and cast them adrift to the land of rakṣasa demons, if among them even one person calls the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, all these people will attain liberation from the difficulty of the rakṣasas. For this reason he is called Avalokiteśvara."

The Xuanzan's text below states: "From the sūtra passage 'If there are those who uphold this...' to 'this Avalokiteśvara.' Commentary: The second section below specifically reveals that when there are calamities and one calls the name, all are liberated. There are seven sections divided into two parts: the first three are the three disasters of fire, water, and wind; the latter four are miscellaneous disasters. This is the first. Within the wind section there are four parts: first, seeking treasure and encountering wind; second, good people teaching recollection; third, escaping disasters and difficulties; fourth, concluding the cause of the name."

The Sui Commentary states: "The sūtra says 'if among them there is even one person' - on one ship there may be one hundred or two hundred people. Among them there is one person who calls Avalokiteśvara's name. This person has also previously had someone teach him to recollect, so he understands recollection. Therefore the commentary states 'good people teaching recollection.'"

The preceding passage in the Xuanzan states: "The correct interpretation should say 'Avalokiteśvara' (Perceiver of Freedom). When the various three karmic activities take refuge, he necessarily manifests transformations through the six supernatural powers. For those without leisure due to calamitous suffering, he flies wheels to crush and extract them, becomes an unrequested friend, and serves as medicine responding to illness. His gathering and benefiting is inconceivable, and he is also called Avalokiteśvara."

The Sui Commentary states: "Saying 'becomes an unrequested friend' means that because beings do not understand the Buddha's teaching of dharma, the bodhisattva responds to their requests and is called an unrequested friend."

The Infinite Meanings Sūtra states...

The commentary on the same sūtra (by Xuance) states: "Third is the virtue of being an unrequested teacher - benefiting others without waiting for requests."

The Vimalakīrti Sūtra, fascicle one, states: "For all beings he becomes an unrequested good friend, continuing the lineage of the Three Jewels so they will not be cut off."

The commentary on the same sūtra (by the Master) states: "He does not see any fixed beings outside the body. Since beings are oneself, he practices compassion as an unrequested friend. To use an analogy, it is like parents compassionately rescuing their children without waiting for requests. Previous stages might wait for others' requests before rescuing them, unable to naturally become unrequested friends. This is all because natural compassion is profound."

Question: For what reason is Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva called Avalokiteśvara (Perceiver of Freedom)? The response states: Because he will succeed Amitāyus Buddha and become Buddha Ratnaraśmi-guṇa-sāgaravairocana-rāja. Regarding this, even if he succeeds Amitāyus Buddha, why does he receive the title Avalokiteśvara? Maitreya will succeed Śākyamuni, Mahāsthāmaprāpta will succeed Avalokiteśvara, etc., but they do not establish this title. Why does Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva's name alone use this reason?

Answer: The Xuanzan has two sections of text. "Because original vows are not the same and beneficial activities differ" first explains the reason for uniquely obtaining this name. "Because he succeeds Amitāyus Buddha and will become Buddha Ratnaraśmi-guṇa-sāgaravairocana-rāja, he is particularly mentioned" provides a second explanation for why this bodhisattva is specifically mentioned. Therefore, looking at the Yūsan's explanation of the phrase "Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara" in the Heart Sūtra: "Possessing compassion and wisdom, particularly practicing loving-kindness and compassion, continuing and elevating the pure land, constantly rescuing the defiled realm. Because stimulus and response correspond, only this one is indicated." The Xuanzan saying "therefore particularly mentioned" and the Yūsan saying "therefore only this one is indicated" have exactly the same meaning. If so, succeeding Amitāyus, etc., is the original condition for particularly encouraging Avalokiteśvara among many bodhisattvas. The question in the commentary asks: "All bodhisattvas have this ability. Why does Avalokiteśvara alone encompass this title?" That is, all bodhisattvas have this ability - why does the World-Honored One uniquely mention his essence? What the present Xuanzan explains penetrates this hidden difficulty.

Dharma Seal Shunan'in obtained the meaning of the Xuanzan through the Compassionate Flower Sūtra, which should be recorded accordingly.

The Xuanzan states: "Question: All bodhisattvas have this ability. Why does Avalokiteśvara alone encompass this title? Answer: Because original vows are not the same and beneficial activities differ. He succeeds Amitāyus Buddha and will become Buddha Ratnaraśmi-guṇa-sāgaravairocana-rāja. Therefore he is particularly mentioned."

The Yūsan states above: "Possessing compassion and wisdom, particularly practicing loving-kindness and compassion, continuing and elevating the pure land, humbly rescuing the defiled realm. Because stimulus and response correspond, only this one is indicated. Or dwelling in high positions, all those with great minds whose marvelous wisdom is accomplished are all 'perceiving freedom.'"

Question: The sūtra text states "At that time Bodhisattva Inexhaustible Intent..." So how does the Master explain the name Inexhaustible Intent? The commentary states: "Because beings are not exhausted, the bodhisattva's intent is inexhaustible, therefore he is called Inexhaustible Intent." Regarding this...

Question (another approach): In the Xuanzan's explanation of Bodhisattva Inexhaustible Intent's name: "Because the realm of beings is not exhausted, the bodhisattva's intent is not exhausted. Therefore he is called Inexhaustible Intent."

So for people who possess the three-vehicle spiritual nature, is there a time of exhaustion, or how is it? Both ways: If there is no period of exhaustion, then with three-vehicle spiritual nature urging internally and various Buddhas' transformative conditions assisting externally, even if beings are inexhaustible, why would there be no period of their exhaustion? If while possessing spiritual nature there is no period of liberation, what difference would there be from people without nature? Therefore the Buddha-bhūmi Treatise states: "Although the former four spiritual natures have no time limit, there is still a period when they complete their fruition and attain liberation, due to the Buddhas' compassion and skillful expedients." If this is so, then in the Master's Pivotal Essentials: "Because the realm of beings has no time of exhaustion, because beings without nature do not become Buddha." Thus it makes the non-exhaustion of those with nature and the non-Buddha-attainment of those without nature two reasons. Among these, if all people with nature are completely liberated, for whom does the Buddha who attains enlightenment last appear? For whom does the Buddha-body of benefiting others expound the holy dharmas of the three vehicles?

Answer: Beings with spiritual nature cannot be exhaustively ended. Why is this so? In the ocean of worlds numbering ineffably ineffable particles of dust, each has beings numbering ineffably ineffable particles of dust, and each individual being...

Ten Impossibilities (Ancient masters used ten proofs to demonstrate that the Entrustment is in the middle of the sūtra, but the Yijue refuted these as Ten Impossibilities.)

1. The Proof of "Ordering Return as Before" Is Impossible
The Yijue states: It only says to cause the transformation buddhas to return to their original lands, but the Prabhūtaratna buddha-stupa has not yet been sent to return. (Above is the ancient masters' proof)
It doesn't say "as before." It only orders the stupa to close, not sending it back to its country. The Saddharmapuṇḍarīka also says "○ returned again to the former place" which also shouldn't be said. The sūtra texts differ, and being only one buddha's teaching, they are also not the same. Because what is seen and heard differs slightly. (Above is the impossibility)

2. The Proof of "Not Speaking of Buddha's Praise" Is Impossible
In the Medicine King chapter it only says "stupa praise." (Above is the proof) ○ Now saying that Prabhūtaratna is in the jeweled stupa praising "excellent" is impossible. Saying the stupa praises is not the Buddha's praise. (Above is the impossibility)

3. The Proof of "Wonderful Sound Lacking Teaching" Is Impossible
The Emerged [bodhisattvas] universally paid homage to the transformation bodies. Wonderful Sound only paid homage to the two buddhas. (Above is the proof) ○ It should also correspond that Mañjuśrī didn't pay homage to the transformation bodies before departing. The Devadatta chapter also says "went to the two World-Honored Ones, completed respectful conduct, and went to Jñānākara," not saying "paid universal homage." How did the transformation buddhas depart? (Above is the impossibility)

4. The Proof of "Defiled Land Not Pure" Is Impossible
The transformation buddhas haven't departed yet. This still causes purity. On the day Wonderful Sound comes, why is he criticized? (Above is the proof) ○ It should also correspond that causing transformation buddhas to go to Vulture Peak, the land should not be pure. If saying "although speaking of going to the mountain, based on the original characteristics explaining the land."

【Lower Section】
In reality it is pure, and Wonderful Sound seeing defilement is also like this. (There are still difficulties. Above is the impossibility)

5. The Proof of "Asking Whether Buddha Comes or Not" Is Impossible
Saying "Does Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna come to listen to the Dharma or not?" Since Prabhūtaratna is not seen, clearly the stupa is already closed. (Above is the proof)
○ Mañjuśrī requests to see Wonderful Sound ○ (Can be seen)

6. The Proof of "Wanting to See Prabhūtaratna" Is Impossible
If the stupa is not yet closed, the two buddhas sitting together should naturally be visible. Why need to request to see? (Above is the proof)
○ If not yet blessed, one immediately cannot see. Because hoping for the Buddha's blessing, one requests to see ○ (Impossibility)

7. The Proof of "Requesting to See, Only Hearing" Is Impossible
Since only hearing the voice, not saying "seeing the Buddha." Clearly knowing, already closed. (Proof) ○ Also Mañjuśrī requesting to see Wonderful Sound reveals not explaining Wonderful Sound's arrival. If Mañjuśrī can see, Mañjuśrī should also truly not behold Wonderful Sound ○ (Can see. Impossibility)

8. The Proof of "Respecting Stupa, Not Buddha" Is Impossible
With two buddhas sitting together, one should pay homage to two honored ones. Why only say paying homage to the Prabhūtaratna stupa? (Proof)
When Samantabhadra comes, it doesn't say "respecting the stupa." The stupa should also be absent. (Impossibility)

9. The Proof of "Two Portions Not Equal" Is Impossible
If the transformation buddhas haven't yet returned, why not make equal offerings? (Proof)
○ Also the dragon girl only offering to Śākyamuni and Prabhūtaratna should also be because of departure ○ (Light difficulty. Impossibility)

10. The Proof of "No Separate Transformation Bodies" Is Impossible
If from the Medicine King chapter onward there are still transformation buddhas, why is there no textual explanation? (Proof) ○ Even if the sūtra text doesn't explain transformation buddhas, what prevents them from still being present as in the Medicine King chapter and later? Not mentioning śrāvakas doesn't mean they immediately don't exist ○ (Impossibility)

Question: When the Great Master refutes the meaning of entrustment in the middle of the sūtra, he presents eight difficulties. What then is the difficulty of contradicting multiple texts?
Answer: In the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka translated by Dharmakṣa of Western Jin and the Supplemented Lotus Sūtra by Jñānagupta and Dharmagupta of the Sui dynasty, this Entrustment chapter is placed at the end of the sūtra. Regarding this, the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka and Supplemented versions have multiple errors. Why use their translations as a definitive standard to criticize Kumārajīva's Wonderful Sūtra? Among these, the Later Qin Tripiṭaka Master, seeing the previous translation placed in the middle of the sūtra, clearly knew to correct Dunhuang's erroneous text and follow the Sanskrit text from Kucha. Additionally, examining the Nanshan Catalog of Buddhist Texts, it states that Jñānagupta arbitrarily moved the Entrustment to the end of the sūtra. Based on this, the Tripiṭaka Masters Dharmakṣa, Dharmagupta and others probably altered the chapter sequence, placing the Entrustment after the Encouragement. Did the commentary master use the two texts as guidance while other teachers fled from mockery and criticism?

Resolving this: When one master's translation contradicts multiple texts, is this correct or incorrect? The wise understanding of past and present sages being already the same, to uniquely oppose without following—how is this not a fault? Since this is an error, making it a difficulty accords with principle. Even if those three texts have many errors, they should be separately corrected based on principle and text.

Regarding what is the same between them, why not use it as evidence? Next, if saying that because the previous text was altered, Kumārajīva necessarily preserved the correct text, then having already altered the Qin text, how could the two persons of the Sui dynasty lack basis? This difficulty should instead become self-defeating. Next, regarding the Catalog of Buddhist Texts, examining the actual text reveals absolutely no character "arbitrarily." Miaole added private words to use as self-evidence. Simply moving the Entrustment—is this not entirely insufficient to cause alarm?

The Private Record, middle volume states (Chanlun).

Question: What is the difficulty of assembly's joy contradicting emotions?
Answer: In the final text of this chapter, the four assemblies and eight groups heard what the Buddha taught and all had great joy. If the Entrustment chapter is in the middle of the sūtra, why does joy arise so early? Regarding this, even if the Tathāgata's entrustment is in the middle of the sūtra, why wouldn't the great assembly rejoice? Seeing the śrāvakas receive predictions of buddhahood, it says "their minds had great joy, leaping immeasurably." Hearing the explanation of buddhahood achieved in the remote past, all had joy. If so, hearing the Tathāgata's entrustment and the great assembly generating joy—what fault is there? Determining the sequence of entrustment based on words of joy doesn't grasp the meaning. How so?

Resolving this: Looking at the sūtra text, "At that time Śākyamuni Buddha caused the transformation-body buddhas who came from the ten directions to each return to their original lands"—this entire section of text together represents the ceremony of the great assembly rolling up their seats and all multitudes completely dispersing. Know that the text "heard what the Buddha taught and all had great joy" is the general conclusion of the entire section. If using those words "paid homage and departed" to read today's text "all had great joy," the textual momentum connects well and

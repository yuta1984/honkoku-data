There are two further meanings. First, above, according with the Buddha's intent; second, below, showing compassion for sentient beings. Wishing to progressively generate merit for the sovereign, it is divided into two portions, manifesting the equality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Only making offerings to the two honored ones.

Also, Śākyamuni is born and becomes wisdom-virtue; Prabhūtaratna is extinguished and is immediately cessation-virtue. This is to reveal that wisdom and cessation are causes of merit. It also reveals that both buddhas receive together, clarifying that the two tathāgatas do not perish.

Question: Should there be a Sanskrit original for the verse section of this chapter? Looking at both sides: if there is, in Dharmarakṣa's translation, the *Saddharmapuṇḍarīka*, the Universal Gate chapter has no verses. We know there is no Sanskrit original. Therefore other volumes of the *Xuanzan* state "even if absent, what would violate principle?" Moreover, the verse "The Honored One of Perfect Wondrous Characteristics answers Akṣayamati with verses" - is this the Tathāgata's answer? If saying so, the textual momentum is quite inconsistent. Also the verse "contemplate Avalokiteśvara's power, [curses] return to the original person" probably differs from other sacred teachings. If relying on this, when the commentator formerly asked the Tripiṭaka Master about the meaning of "compassionate mind, wondrous great cloud," the Master examined the Sanskrit original and correctly stated "maitākāraṇayamana," which should be called "compassionate mind." Based on this, there should be a Sanskrit original.

Answer: This chapter's repeated verses exist in the Sanskrit original, so the first volume of *Xuanzan* states: "I once asked my former teacher about the meaning of 'compassionate mind, wondrous great cloud.' The Master examined the Sanskrit original and found it already contained this verse, correctly stating 'huaidanlaiyamana,' which should be called 'compassionate mind,' not 'compassionate sound.' Therefore it definitely exists." When the Tripiṭaka Master was alive, he personally examined the Sanskrit texts, saying "already containing this verse" and "therefore definitely existing." Why reach the point of doubt?

However, elsewhere stating "even if absent, what would violate principle" refers to someone doubting the existence of Buddha's teaching based on the text "returning to the original person," so the commentary master resolved this, taking analogies to establish meaning, saying "though initially harmful, it must later be beneficial," then "since the verses don't contradict the doctrine, even if absent, what would violate principle?" Using hypothetical temporary words, how could this disturb clear explanations?

Next, regarding the text "Honored One of Perfect Wondrous Characteristics" and such, the commentary states: "This is the sūtra compilers' collection arranged as verses," citing the *Śrīmālā Sūtra* as an example.

*Xuanzan* volume 1 states: "Also stated: the Avalokiteśvara Universal Gate chapter originally had no verses throughout. Some who include them are later additions by subsequent people. Common people often doubt, saying: if Buddha's teaching, why do the verses say 'verses of the Honored One of Perfect Wondrous Characteristics'? Answer: Akṣayamati, this is the sūtra compilers' collection arranged as verses. Like the *Śrīmālā Sūtra* stating 'when this thought arose, the Buddha appeared in space' and such, from former verses, later conveniently made into verses, thereby generating later verses. The intervening text is short, prose would be inconvenient. Principle should also be accessible. Also there is doubt saying: if Buddha's teaching, why do verses say 'curses and various poisons return to the original person'? How could the Buddha World-Honored One reversely harm life? Formerly also causing confusion, I once asked my former teacher about the meaning of 'compassionate sound, wondrous great cloud.' The Master examined the Sanskrit original, already containing this verse, correctly stating 'huaidanlaiyamana,' which should be called 'compassionate mind,' not 'compassionate sound.' Therefore it definitely exists."

*Lotus Commentary Record* volume 10 (Tiantai Zhanran) states: "Regarding the verses following the text, Kumārajīva did not translate them. Recent generations all say they exist in the Sanskrit original. This also cannot fathom Kumārajīva's profound intent. The *Continued Biographies of Monks* states: the verses were translated by Jñānagupta. Now following the old text, there is nothing to explain. Regarding 'returning to the original person,' see *Śamatha-vipaśyanā* record 8."

Question: In the expanded Lotus Sūtra, Bodhisattva Vyūharāja asks Akṣayamati about the cause of Avalokiteśvara's name. Should Bodhisattva Akṣayamati answer with verses?

Question: In the expanded Lotus Sūtra, "Listen to Avalokiteśvara's practices, skillfully responding to all directions" and such - are these current verses Bodhisattva Akṣayamati's answer or the Tathāgata's answer? Looking at both sides: if Akṣayamati's answer, correctly viewing that sūtra shows "Honored One of Perfect Wondrous Characteristics, verses answering Akṣayamati, listen to Avalokiteśvara's practices" and such. Clearly knowing this is the World-Honored One's answer. If relying on this, the Master elsewhere cites that sūtra: "Akṣayamati comprehensively observes Avalokiteśvara's past vow-ocean, tells Vyūharāja, and explains verses."

*Xuanzan* volume 1 states: "Also, in the sūtra added during Sui times, Bodhisattva Vyūharāja asks Akṣayamati about the cause and reason for Avalokiteśvara's name. Bodhisattva Akṣayamati comprehensively observes Avalokiteśvara's past vow-ocean, tells Vyūharāja, and explains verses. If so, why do the verses say 'World-Honored One of Wondrous Characteristics, I now ask again, that Honored One of Perfect Wondrous Characteristics answers Akṣayamati with verses'? The text already contradicts itself. Therefore we know it is erroneous."

*Mirror Water Notes* volume 6 states: "The prose sūtra states: At that time Bodhisattva Vyūharāja addressed Akṣayamati: 'For what cause and condition is he named Avalokiteśvara?' At this time Bodhisattva Akṣayamati comprehensively observed Avalokiteśvara's past vow-ocean and told Bodhisattva Vyūharāja, answering with verses. This should directly say 'Perfect Akṣayamati answers Vyūharāja with verses,' yet in the verses it conversely has the World-Honored One answering Akṣayamati saying 'Honored One of Perfect Wondrous Characteristics answers Akṣayamati with verses.' The questioner is not the same, the answerer is not the same. The text already contradicts. Therefore we know it is erroneous." The meaning is that since the text already contradicts, the Vyūharāja text should not exist. Another person's explanation says: Bodhisattva Vyūharāja questions Akṣayamati, Bodhisattva Akṣayamati transmits to the World-Honored One, then the World-Honored One tells Akṣayamati. This principle is also not prevented.

Regarding variant texts of the expanded Lotus:
One text states: At that time Bodhisattva Vyūharāja asked Akṣayamati: "The Buddha explained Avalokiteśvara's name, origin, and spiritual power - what is this meaning?" Akṣayamati comprehensively observed Avalokiteśvara's past vow-ocean and, following what was asked, told Vyūharāja, explaining verses saying: "World-Honored One of Perfect Wondrous Characteristics... Honored One of Perfect Wondrous Characteristics answers Akṣayamati with verses."

Answer: The *Xuanzan* elsewhere, seeing this text, criticizes the contradiction of before and after. Initially marking "Akṣayamati answers," in the verses saying "Honored One of Perfect Wondrous Characteristics answers Akṣayamati with verses" - it appears to be the Tathāgata's answer.

One text lacks "World-Honored One of Perfect Wondrous Characteristics" through "answers Akṣayamati - one and a half verses," making "Listen to Avalokiteśvara's practices" the beginning of the verses.

One text is completely identical to the Wondrous Sūtra's Akṣayamati questioning and World-Honored One answering.

Why does he lack this virtue? Wonderful-Sound and Avalokiteśvara manifest pratyekabuddha bodies and preach dharma. Because the provisional leads to the real, pratyekabuddhas should preach dharma. Therefore Master Puxiang also discusses pratyekabuddhas preaching dharma. How so?

Resolving: Pratyekabuddha sages may preach the Lotus to some extent. Like King Brahmadeva who generated joy based on a pratyekabuddha's preaching. Therefore the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra states: "Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are also like this. When there are not yet great bodhisattvas, they can roar like lions and preach dharma for edification." In the present sūtra, the text about Wonderful-Sound and Avalokiteśvara manifesting pratyekabuddha bodies to preach dharma also allows knowing the real through the provisional. But perhaps in the present chapter it was abbreviated based on the general explanation. The Compendium Commentary states: "If somewhere it says they 'do not preach dharma,' there are two meanings: first, because they do not preach much, they are called 'non-preachers'; second, because their preaching cannot enable others to attain sainthood, they are also called 'non-preachers.'" Pratyekabuddhas deeply delight in tranquility and awaken by themselves without teachers. They speak little. Those they convert also mostly resemble their teacher. Therefore they do not await others' teachings. Even if rarely hearing them, they cannot attain sainthood. Even if among those converted there are śrāvaka faculties, they plant liberation-conducive wholesome roots but do not reach fruit attainment. Therefore they do not preach dharma.

The Compendium Commentary III states: "Regarding the commentary from 'pratyekabuddhas' to 'heat and other dharmas' - Question: Some sūtras also say pratyekabuddhas convert beings who attain sainthood. How does this differ? Answer: If manifesting supernatural powers enables others to attain fruits, this is reasonable. Preaching dharma is not like this. The Mahādharmadhvaja-dhāraṇī Sūtra II states: 'Those pratyekabuddhas possess full wisdom, yet cannot preach dharma to save people.' Do they completely not preach, or do they preach a little? Answer: They preach a little. The Buddha's Original Acts Sūtra states: 'When King Brahmadeva came to the pratyekabuddha, the pratyekabuddha preached various dharmas briefly, causing the king's joyful excitement to be boundless and revealing wholesome matters.' If somewhere it says they 'do not preach dharma,' there are two meanings: first, because they do not preach much, they are called 'non-preachers'; second, because their preaching cannot enable others to attain sainthood, they are also called 'non-preachers.'" Question: The Contemplation of Buddha Samādhi Sūtra IV states: "All pratyekabuddhas throw bowls into empty space from under one foot, performing eighteen transformations. Under each foot of all pratyekabuddhas are letters that fully explain the twelve-link dependent origination." Answer: The various sūtras do not say all pratyekabuddhas never preach. There may be immediate attainment."

The Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra XXXV states: "Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are also like this. When there are not yet great bodhisattvas, they can roar like lions and preach dharma for edification."

Question: The sūtra text says "like darkness obtaining a lamp, like a torch removing darkness." Should these two analogies have distinctions? If there are distinctions, speaking of lamps and torches, their characteristics are not different. They equally break through dark obscurity. What distinction is there? If so, among the twelve analogies, why raise both analogies side by side? Surely there must be separate meanings?

Resolving: The Xuanzan Commentary explains the eighth "like a lamp in darkness" as obtaining wisdom, and explains the twelfth "like a torch removing darkness" as breaking through the darkness of ignorance. The meanings of dharma and analogy are not without distinctions. Looking again at the sūtra text's characteristics, first it raises the time of darkness, saying "obtaining a lamp." This is because in the midst of ignorant darkness, one obtains the essence of wisdom. Later it only raises the essence of the torch, saying "removing darkness." Know that this reveals wisdom's function of removing delusion.

This represents essence and function, obstruction and revelation. Their meanings are truly different.

The Xuanzan Commentary states: "From 'like a cool pond' to 'like a torch removing darkness' in the sūtra. Commentary: This analogical teaching has twelve parts: first, fulfilling wishes; second, accomplishing the path; third, having shame and conscience; fourth, obtaining a guide; fifth, obtaining refuge; sixth, transcending birth and death; seventh, removing afflictions; eighth, obtaining wisdom; ninth, acquiring sacred wealth; tenth, having instruction; eleventh, knowing the treasure location; twelfth, breaking through the darkness of ignorance."

The Water Commentary states: "Question: What is the difference between removing afflictions and breaking the darkness of ignorance? Answer: Removing afflictions means generally removing afflictions. Breaking the darkness of ignorance means specifically breaking ignorance. Question: What is the difference between lamps and torches? Answer: Obtaining wisdom is called a lamp; breaking the darkness of ignorance is called a torch. The two meanings are distinct."

Master Xing's commentary states: "The seventh is praise for removing delusion, which is illness obtaining a doctor. The eighth is praise for obtaining wisdom, which is darkness obtaining a lamp. The twelfth is praise for breaking ignorance, which is a torch removing darkness."

Question: The sūtra text states: "If there are women who hear this sūtra and practice as taught, they immediately go to the Land of Bliss." What does this reveal? Answer: It should be interpreted as the text indicates. Regarding this, the Land of Bliss is the realm of Mahāyāna wholesome roots. There are no names of reproach whatsoever. Why would one easily be born in that land with a defiled body? Those Śakras, Brahmās, and wheel-turning kings are rewards of the defiled land, yet they still disdain the body with five obstacles. The pure buddha-lands transcend the three realms. How could they be dwelling places for women? Therefore Vasubandhu's treatise states: "Women and those with deficient faculties, and those of the two vehicles are not born there." Nāgārjuna praised this, saying there is suddenly "no fear of women or evil destinies." Why does the sūtra text have doubts at first glance?

Resolving: Regarding the Land of Bliss, concerning the doctrine of sambhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya lands, the Master made two explanations. If following the doctrine of only sambhogakāya land, the present sūtra text either refers to manifested women or represents different-time intention. Real women of this type are not born in the next life. If following the interpretation that includes nirmāṇakāya lands, even if women in this world, through rebirth and transformation of body, why would they not be born in the pure land? Queen Vaidehī and five hundred attendant women were born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. Hearing sūtras and being born in pure lands is precisely the proof. With the One Vehicle Lotus, practicing as taught, the benefit of powerful rebirth is not difficult. The Pure Land treatises discuss the sambhogakāya land aspect.

Question: Hearing the present sūtra and practicing as taught, women are born in the Land of Bliss. Does "women" here refer to the stage of cultivating causes, or to being born in that realm and receiving female bodies? There are two aspects. If the former, the Master's Abhidharma Commentary refutes those who say "cultivating causes includes women, but all who are born there are male," arguing that being born with female bodies does not occur. How does this accord with the matter of supremely wonderful appearance? If the latter, the Western Essential Decisions states: "Women born there all transform from female to male." The Comprehensive Praise Commentary, Pure Shadows Commentary on the Contemplation Sūtra, etc., all agree with this. Additionally, the Sūtra of Equal Enlightenment, the Dual Contemplation Sūtra, etc., state that all born in Ultimate Bliss become males. How so?

Resolving: All teachings describing that world state there are no women or evil destinies. One does not even hear their names, much less have their substance. The Western Essential Decisions, etc., have no different doctrines. But the Abhidharma Commentary, etc., based on the Drum-Sound King Sūtra's teaching, refute other masters' biased attachments. That sūtra also explains one faculty

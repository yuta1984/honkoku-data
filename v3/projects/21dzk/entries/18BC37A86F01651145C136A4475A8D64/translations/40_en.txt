Repenting and receiving the three collections of precepts, etc. Only through such entreaty can one finally see Samantabhadra.

The Samantabhadra Sūtra states: "At that time, if practitioners wish to fulfill the bodhisattva precepts, they should join palms in a secluded place, prostrate universally to the Buddhas of the ten directions, and repent all sins... and make these words... Only may Śākyamuni Buddha, the perfectly enlightened World-Honored One, be my precept master. May Mañjuśrī, who possesses great compassion, with wisdom bestow the pure bodhisattva dharmas. May Maitreya Bodhisattva also listen to my receiving the bodhisattva dharmas. May the Buddhas of the ten directions now serve as my witnesses. May the great bodhisattvas assist and protect us. Today I uphold the Vaipulya sutras, and even unto losing life, even if falling into hell and receiving immeasurable suffering, I will never slander the true dharma of the Buddhas. Through the power of these causal merits, now may Śākyamuni Buddha be my precept master, Mañjuśrī be my ācārya, the future Maitreya bestow the precept dharmas, the Buddhas of the ten directions witness and know me, and the great virtue bodhisattvas be my companions. Now depending on the profound subtle meaning of Mahāyāna sutras, I take refuge in Buddha, take refuge in Dharma, take refuge in Saṅgha. Thus speaking three times. Having taken refuge in the Three Jewels, next one should make vows and receive the six major dharmas... Because Samantabhadra assists in arousing practice."

The Heart-Ground Contemplation Sūtra, volume 3, states: "If one wishes to receive and uphold the supreme precepts, one should request the precept master Buddha-bodhisattvas. Request my Śākyamuni Buddha to be the bodhisattva precept master. Dragon-Seed Pure Wisdom Honored King Buddha should be the pure precept ācārya. The future guide Maitreya Buddha should be the pure instructor. The present Two-Footed Honored Ones of the ten directions should be the pure precept witnesses. All bodhisattvas of the ten directions should be the precept study companions. Brahmā, Śakra, the Four Kings, and Vajra devas should be the external protectors for precept study.

Respectfully requesting such Buddha-bodhisattvas and present precept-transmitting masters, universally to repay the four kindnesses, arousing the pure bodhi mind, one should receive the bodhisattva three collections of precepts: precepts benefiting all sentient beings, precepts cultivating and gathering all good dharmas, precepts cultivating and gathering all disciplinary rules."

The Decisive Selection Record states: "The commentary's section from 'diligence' to 'principles of emptiness dharmas' is abbreviated in quotation. Now presenting it more extensively. According to that sutra, it clarifies the six dharmas... (The quotation is very extensive; one should examine it.) However, regarding the names of the six masters, the sutra has clear text. Why does the commentary master say the text has not been seen?"

Question: Regarding the explanation of the fruits of the ten dharma practices in this chapter, the text on middle-grade cultivation does not mention the heavenly realms obtained. What is the reason? The Xuanzan states "because they do not see Buddha, the text is abbreviated without fruit." Regarding this, depending on the cultivating causes of the ten dharma practices, one receives the fruit-retribution of the six desire heavens, dividing this into three grades, making the fourth heaven the superior fruit and the remaining five heavens the middle and lower retributions. If the reason for not explaining is that it is not where Buddha resides, why does it clarify the inferior fruit by saying "should be born in Trāyastriṃśa heaven"?

Explanation: The Comprehensive Explanation states: "'Or not seeing Buddha' explains the upper two heavens as the basis for middle grade. 'Text abbreviated without fruit' explains what the sutra does not mention." The meaning is that making Tuṣita heaven the superior grade, when cultivating fruit, the upper two heavens should belong to the superior grade. But now making them middle grade responds to difficulties by saying "because they do not see Buddha." The next "text abbreviated without fruit" properly addresses why the sutra does not explain the three heavens. If so, the text "because they do not see Buddha" does not explain "the reason for not explaining." Therefore there is no fault.

The sutra states: "If one merely copies, this person at life's end should be born in Trāyastriṃśa heaven... How much more so for upholding, reciting, proper mindfulness, understanding the meaning and趣, and practicing as taught. If someone upholds, recites, and understands the meaning, this person at life's end will have a thousand Buddhas extend their hands, causing no fear and no fall into evil destinies, immediately going to Tuṣita heaven to Maitreya Bodhisattva's place... and being born therein."

The Xuanzan states: "From the sutra's 'if merely copying' to 'pleasure and happiness.' Commentary: The third below has three aspects of conferring later benefits. Inferior cultivation is born in Trāyastriṃśa and other heavens. Middle cultivation through 'upholding, etc.' is born in Yāma and other heavens. Superior cultivation has 'thousand Buddhas extending hands, etc.' This first... birth in the lower four heavens is also inferior birth, abbreviated and not mentioned. From the sutra's 'how much more upholding' to 'practicing as taught.' Commentary: This middle cultivation of 'upholding, etc.' is born in Yāma heaven and the upper two heavens. Because they do not see Buddha, the text is abbreviated without fruit. From the sutra's 'if someone' to 'being born therein.' Commentary: This is superior cultivation."

The Comprehensive Explanation states: "From the commentary's 'born in Yāma heaven' to 'text abbreviated without fruit,' Tuṣita heaven has Maitreya Buddha, and the various gods can see him. The sutra text clearly mentions this. In Yāma heaven and the upper two heavens there is no Buddha. The gods have nothing to see. Therefore the sutra abbreviates and does not explain this as the fruit felt by middle cultivation. Discussion: Trāyastriṃśa heaven also has no Buddha there. Why does the sutra speak thus? This merely raises the fruits felt by inferior and superior cultivation to shadow-manifest the middle fruit. It is not necessarily about whether they see Buddha or not to determine speaking or not speaking. Or 'not seeing Buddha' explains the upper two heavens as the basis for middle grade. 'Text abbreviated without fruit' explains what the sutra does not say. Following this principle, the commentary's words are without fault. The text is concise but the meaning is comprehensive. Examining that, one gradually awakens."

Question: Regarding dividing the ten dharma practices into three grades of cultivating causes in this chapter, what grade among the three is the text "if someone upholds, recites, and understands the meaning"? Answer: The Xuanzan states "this is superior cultivation." Regarding this, above it clarifies middle grade: "how much more upholding, reciting, proper mindfulness, understanding the meaning, and practicing as taught." Now explaining superior grade does not exceed that middle grade. If so, the superior and middle grades seem to have no distinction. If saying "although the number of practices is the same, cultivation has superiority and inferiority, so they are divided into middle and superior," the sutra has no such meaning. Also, regarding the ten dharma practices, three grades need not necessarily be fixed. They can also be divided according to the superiority and inferiority of cultivation. Even if cultivating four or five practices, if the cultivating cause is inferior, it can be inferior grade. Why does clarifying inferior grade say "if merely copying," exclusively presenting one practice?

Explanation: In the section conferring later benefits among the ten dharma practices, the text is divided into three. "If merely copying should be born in Trāyastriṃśa heaven" etc. is the inferior cultivation's fruit. "How much more upholding and reciting" etc. is middle grade. "If there are further people" below is superior cultivation's obtained fruit. Superior grade has four aspects: first, thousand Buddhas extending hands; second, causing no fear; third, the rebirth place of being born in Tuṣita; fourth, seeing the bodhisattva. The characteristics of superior grade have no confusion at all. Only regarding the numerical example difficulty, the text "how much more upholding and reciting" etc. abbreviates and does not explain obtaining fruit. It is definitely a separate section from the preceding and following texts. Therefore, not considering the quantity of practices performed, this is made middle grade. How much more so using quantity to divide grades - this is a single-characteristic explanation. Although similarly cultivating those practices, each individually has three grades. Based on this, the Xuanzan states:

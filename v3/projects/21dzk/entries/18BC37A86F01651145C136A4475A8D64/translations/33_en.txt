The Chapter on the Adorning King

Question: In the Lotus Treatise, it states that the power of superior merit-virtue is manifested in the Wonderful Adorning King chapter. Then, should other chapters also explain the power of superior merit-virtue? Answer: Regarding what is explained in other chapters, the Lotus Treatise and Xuanzan only say it is manifested in this chapter, not that other chapters explain it. If limited to this chapter, what clarifies the extraordinary power of this sūtra is called "power of superior merit-virtue," but the superior functions of the Lotus explained in various chapters can all be called powers of superior merit-virtue. The dragon daughter's attainment of buddhahood, Devadatta's prophecy, Medicine King's ascetic practices, Avalokiteśvara's rescue of sentient beings, etc. - all are the superior powers of this sūtra. How can it be said to be limited to this chapter?

Answer: In the treatise's assignment of the seven types of cultivation power to various chapters, the power of superior merit-virtue is manifested in the Wonderful Adorning King chapter. Depending on past merit-virtue, those two sons have such power. The commentary explains the coming intention: converting the father king of wrong views and obtaining future buddha prophecy all result from the power of Lotus merit-virtue. Merit-virtue is not singular, and though威力 are many, since the證主 is already called "power of superior merit-virtue," this is dharma power and good friend power - overturning wrong views, receiving buddha prophecy, surpassing other matters.

The Lotus Treatise states: Cultivation power is manifested through five gates... Fourth is power of superior merit-virtue... Power of superior merit-virtue is manifested in the Wonderful Adorning King chapter. Depending on past merit-virtue, those two sons have such power.

The Xuanzan states: First, what the treatise calls "power of superior merit-virtue" is manifested in the Wonderful Adorning King chapter. This clarifies that Pure Treasury and Pure Eyes, holding the Lotus Sūtra, through the power of superior merit-virtue of perfected practitioners, convert the father king of wrong views and obtain future buddha prophecy - all due to the power of Lotus merit-virtue. Explaining their original conditions benefits the contemporary assembly, therefore this chapter comes.

Question: Regarding this chapter's title being called "Wonderful Adorning King Chapter" rather than "Pure Treasury and Pure Eyes Chapter," how does the Great Master explain this? The Xuanzan gives three reasons. First, through the power of superior merit-virtue, abandoning wrong and entering right - the wonderfully adorning body is not the two sons. Second, the previously mentioned Flower Virtue Bodhisattva is the presently explained Wonderful Adorning King - wanting to unite that identity, it becomes the chapter title. Third, Pure Treasury and Pure Eyes are the present Medicine King and Medicine Superior. Having already explained Medicine King previously, fearing confusion, they are not used as the name. Regarding the second reason, to reveal that Flower Virtue is the Wonderful Adorning King, using Adorning King as the name - the previously mentioned Medicine King is the present Pure Eyes. To unite Medicine King with the former Pure Eyes, it could also be the chapter name. Why unite Flower Virtue but not want to reveal the Medicine King matter? Regarding the third reason, Pure Treasury and Pure Eyes are ancient names, Medicine King and Medicine Superior are present appellations. Medicine King's present ascetic power and Pure Treasury Pure Eyes' ancient original conditions - making them separate chapter names, what confusion is there? Answer: The second reasoning is clearly logical. The present analogical difficulty seems useless.

Even raising Medicine King, one should still use Flower Virtue as an example. Moreover, Flower Virtue Bodhisattva attained Lotus samādhi, has benefits in this assembly, uniting past and present to inform the assembly - there is particular reason for this. The third reasoning: using Medicine King again as chapter title makes the error of confusion heavy. Even if the explained matters differ before and after, since the titles are already the same, it's not as good as Wonderful Adorning King having no confusion at all. If Pure Eyes should be the name, though there's no name confusion, there could still be substantial confusion. Adorning King has confusion in neither name nor substance, being most excellent.

The Xuanzan states: Question: This chapter properly clarifies Pure Treasury and Pure Eyes as good spiritual friends. Why not use them as the chapter name? Answer: Through superior merit-virtue, turning from wrong to right - the wonderfully adorning body is not the two sons. Though they become good friends, the father borrows merit-virtue and the body enters correctness. Also, the former Flower Virtue is the Wonderful Adorning. Wanting to unite that identity, it becomes the chapter. Also, Pure Treasury and Pure Eyes are the present Medicine King and Medicine Superior. Having already clarified Medicine King previously, fearing title confusion, they are not mentioned.

The Collected Commentary states: Regarding the commentary "Also Pure Eyes... therefore not explained": Question: Wonderful Adorning King is the former Flower Virtue. Clarifying it again now, why isn't it repeated confusion? Though Adorning King is Flower Virtue, Flower Virtue wasn't titled as a chapter before. Establishing the name title now, there's no repeated confusion. Pure Eyes is the former Medicine King. Medicine King was previously marked as chapter title. Mentioning it again now would have no repeated confusion, so it's not taken.

Question: The sūtra text states that the two bodhisattvas Pure Treasury and Pure Eyes are the present Medicine King and Medicine Superior. Then, is the former Pure Treasury called the present Medicine King Bodhisattva? Answer: The Collected Commentary states: Pure Eyes is Medicine King. Regarding this, looking at the sūtra text from beginning to end, after explaining "one named Pure Treasury, two named Pure Eyes," it says "these are the present Medicine King and Medicine Superior Bodhisattvas." Additionally, the Xuanzan states "Pure Treasury and Pure Eyes are Medicine King and Medicine Superior." Following the sūtra text and Xuanzan, Pure Treasury and Pure Eyes are respectively the present Medicine King and Medicine Superior. What evidence does樸揚 have for explaining it this way?

Answer: The Collected Commentary's meaning that "Pure Eyes is the former Medicine King" probably depends on the Sūtra of Contemplating Medicine King and Medicine Superior. In that sūtra, Medicine King Bodhisattva will attain buddhahood and be called Tathāgata Pure Eyes. Medicine Superior Bodhisattva, following Medicine King, will later attain buddhahood and be called Tathāgata Pure Treasury. Using future buddha names to determine past original names: Pure Eyes is the present Medicine King, Pure Treasury is also the present Medicine Superior. However, regarding the sūtra text, since there was an order of brothers in the past, Pure Treasury is mentioned first. In the present, Medicine King is superior so listed first perhaps. They don't necessarily correspond in order. The commentary text should also follow the sūtra. Or the Collected Commentary quotes the commentary saying "Also Pure Eyes, etc." Since it first quotes Pure Eyes, we know the commentary master, unlike the sūtra's sequence, wants to match Pure Eyes with Medicine King.

The sūtra states (the context above and below can be seen). Xuanzan Collected Commentary (written above).

The Sūtra of Contemplating Medicine King and Medicine Superior states: The Buddha told Maitreya Ajita: This Medicine King Bodhisattva will attain buddhahood and be called Tathāgata Pure Eyes... Then the World-Honored One again told Maitreya: This Medicine Superior Bodhisattva, following Medicine King, will later attain buddhahood and be called Tathāgata Pure Treasury...

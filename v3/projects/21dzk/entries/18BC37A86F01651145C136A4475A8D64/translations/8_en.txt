It's not progressive multiplication. When he explains Amitābha's physical dimensions as "sixty trillion nayuta yojanas," though "trillion," "billion," "nayuta," etc. all multiply by tens, there is still the number six. This should also be so. This example cannot be calculated. Next, the matter of raising one ultimate number is also not difficult. That is, such examples cannot be sought elsewhere. The present text saying "thousand trillion billion nayuta" is precisely this. Why strongly question the three [numbers] akṣobhya, etc.? Next, regarding the master's explanation, I haven't seen evidence for it. It doesn't match the actual text of the Abhidharmakośa. The Xuanzan's interpretation is extremely ○ suitable for adoption.

The Xuanzan states: "Regarding gaṅkāra, etc., the twelfth fascicle of the Abhidharmakośa explains that there are sixty numbers. The other eight are forgotten. Progressively accumulating by tens, reaching the sixteenth is called kiṅkara. The seventeenth is called mahākiṅkara. The eighteenth is called piṅbara. The nineteenth is called mahāpiṅbara. The twentieth is called acchubha. The twenty-first is called mahācchubha. These three types in total are precisely the sixteenth, eighteenth, and twentieth numbers."

Master Xing's commentary states: "Some say gaṅkāra refers to four-syllable verses, piṅbara to five-syllable verses, and akṣobhya to seven-syllable verses. This is probably incorrect. Though they may have some validity in expression, there's no reliable standard to follow. Now, following the sixty numbers in the Abhidharmakośa treatise, progressively accumulating by tens to reach the sixteenth is called kiṅkara. This is what we call gaṅkāra. The eighteenth is called piṅbara. This is what we call piṅbara. The twentieth is called acchubha. This is what we call akṣobhya. There are only differences in Sanskrit pronunciation."

Question: The sūtra states "I entrust the Buddha-Dharma to you." Is this Buddha-Dharma the One Vehicle Dharma, or what? If it's One Vehicle Dharma, looking at the sūtra, it first entrusts with Buddha-Dharma, then later entrusts with anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi Dharma. Buddha-Dharma refers to Three Vehicle Dharma, and anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi Dharma refers to One Vehicle Dharma. Otherwise, wouldn't this be redundant? Moreover, that buddha-land has 7.2 billion Ganges sand śrāvakas. Why wouldn't he teach Two Vehicle Dharma for them? According to this, the Mirror Water Commentary, etc. calls Three Vehicle Dharma "Buddha-Dharma." If following this, then Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha is a sambhogakāya buddha for others' benefit. Would he really entrust Three Vehicle Dharma to the next-in-line bodhisattva? Thus the Vijñānavāda treatise, explaining the sambhogakāya for others' benefit, states it enables them to enjoy the bliss of Mahāyāna Dharma.

Resolving: The dual entrustment of Buddha-Dharma and anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi Dharma is indeed as questioned. Are they respectively Three Vehicle and One Vehicle Dharma? The Entrustment chapter, etc. calls this sūtra "anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi Dharma" when entrusting it to bodhisattvas. Or again, are they respectively Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna Dharma? Though teaching Three Vehicles, Mahāyāna is precisely One Vehicle. Because there are no shallow and deep [distinctions]. Regarding these two interpretations, the matter of teaching Hīnayāna, etc. in pure lands should be inferred in various ways. First, Flower-Light Tathāgata, though not in an evil world, teaches Three Vehicle Dharma due to his original vows. Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha should also be thus. Or what fault is there in one buddha having both pure and impure lands simultaneously? Or for great bodhisattvas he additionally teaches provisional teachings to enable them to save those with Two Vehicle capacities. Therefore there's no contradiction throughout.

The Water Commentary states: "Question: The initial passage already speaks of entrusting Buddha-Dharma, then speaks of entrusting anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi—what's the difference?

【Left Page】

Answer: The initial Buddha-Dharma encompasses the Three Vehicles, while later entrusting anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi refers only to One Vehicle Dharma, hence the distinction."

The Private Record states: "Question: When the Lotus Sūtra hasn't yet been taught, one distinguishes the Three Vehicles. After the Lotus Sūtra has already been taught, it's precisely One Vehicle Dharma, so why distinguish between Three Vehicle and One Vehicle? Answer: Since that buddha-land already has assemblies of seventy-two Ganges sand śrāvakas, among the capacities to be taught there are Three Vehicle Dharma, therefore among the teachings that teach there are Three Vehicle Dharma. Question: If those śrāvaka assemblies are genuine practitioners, upon hearing the Lotus Sūtra they immediately turn their minds, so their practices are the bodhisattva path. If they're provisional manifestations they all realize One Vehicle Dharma. What use is Two Vehicle Dharma? That buddha-land should have no Two Vehicle Dharma. Furthermore, the Four Noble Truths, Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, Six Perfections, etc. are Three Vehicle Dharma. Teaching, principle, practice, and fruition are One Vehicle Dharma. Because these Dharmas are entrusted to bodhisattvas, initially it speaks of Three Vehicle Dharma, later it speaks of One Vehicle Dharma."

Question: Is Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha a sambhogakāya for others' benefit, or what? The Xuanzan [says] it's sambhogakāya for others' benefit. Regarding this.

Question: This chapter clarifies matters concerning Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha. If so, is he a sambhogakāya buddha for others' benefit? The Xuanzan [says] sambhogakāya for others' benefit. Regarding this, looking at the entire chapter's context, above it lists retinue saying there are seventy-two Ganges sand śrāvakas, below it presents benefits gained—those seeking śrāvaka [status] and initial bodhicitta bodhisattvas attained the samādhi of manifesting all physical forms. If he's a sambhogakāya buddha for others' benefit, why speak of having śrāvaka assemblies and present benefits gained by ordinary beings, etc.?

Additionally, that buddha entrusted the three-thousand world system to Gladly-Seen Bodhisattva. By this we know he's the teaching buddha of one three-thousand world system. Moreover, after his extinction erecting stupas and collecting relics is extremely a matter for nirmāṇakāya. Thus Master Xing [considers him] a nirmāṇakāya buddha. How so?

Resolving: That buddha is a sambhogakāya. Therefore the Xuanzan [states]: "Erecting three stupas. Because this is sambhogakāya for others' benefit, their dimensions are extremely high." The stupa dimensions refer to the text about the height of three worlds. Those dimensions truly don't suit a nirmāṇakāya land. However, since there are many difficulties on one side, and in reality all permit the transformation land aspect, there's no contradiction. This should be understood by analogy with Great-Universal-Wisdom-Excellence Tathāgata. Or again, "śrāvakas" borrows that designation in explanation—they're actually bodhisattvas. "Three-thousand worlds" refers to hundreds of thousands of millions of three-thousand world systems. Analogous to the petals of a flower platform, perhaps just raising that portion.

Inquiry: Does the sambhogakāya actually have relics? If so, even heavenly beings in impure lands are born by transformation and thus have no remains. All buddhas accepting womb-birth is to leave relics. But sambhogakāya for others' benefit transcends the three realms. It's still difficult to speak of transformation birth. How much more having bodily remains? If there are no relics, why does the Xuanzan use the dimensions of relic stupas as proof of sambhogakāya buddha?

Answer: The teaching [body] of transformation can transform, but actual sambhogakāya has difficulty leaving relics. If what this chapter explains is for bodhisattvas with compositional bodies from the seventh stage downward, though a sambhogakāya buddha, when incidentally manifesting parents, royal kingdom, at that time he shows relics perhaps. This should be investigated.

The sūtra states: "Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha ○ in the latter part of the night entered nirvāṇa. At that time All-Beings-Gladly-Seen Bodhisattva ○ after his extinction collected the relics and made eighty-four thousand precious vessels."

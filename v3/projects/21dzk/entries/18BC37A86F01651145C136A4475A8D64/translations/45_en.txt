Private Record on the Meaning of the One Vehicle, Volume One

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Compiled by Priest Shinkō

Question: The fourth volume of the *Hokke Gensan* states: "The meaning of the One Vehicle is precisely the principle of this sutra," etc. In clarifying this One Vehicle, how many approaches are there?
Answer: The text states: "Now, briefly using five approaches to distinguish [them]," etc. Namely: first, the approach of revealing the essential nature; second, the approach of explaining the name; third, the approach of clarifying the intention of the teaching; fourth, the approach of manifesting distinctions; fifth, the approach of clarification through questions and answers.

Question: What is the meaning of the first approach of revealing essential nature?
Answer: Revealing essential nature is briefly divided into three categories: first, the comprehensive-containing essence; second, the following-excellence essence; third, the true-reality essence.

Question: What is the meaning of the first comprehensive-containing essence?
Answer: This is the meaning of comprehensively containing all dharmas as the essence of the One Vehicle. Therefore the text states: "First, the comprehensive-containing essence refers to all uncontaminated [dharmas], whether seeds or manifest, conditioned or unconditioned, whether causes or effects, fundamental or expedient means, that are capable of perfecting Buddha-virtue—all are called the One Vehicle," etc.

Question: What is the meaning of "all uncontaminated, whether seeds, etc."?
Answer: "All" means comprehensive inclusion. "Uncontaminated" excludes the contaminated. "Whether seeds" refers to the seeds of the four wisdoms. "Whether manifest" refers to the manifest activity of the four wisdoms. "Conditioned" refers to the Truth of the Path. "Unconditioned" refers to the Truth of Cessation. "Whether causes" refers to the meritorious dharmas within the bodies of sudden-awakening and gradual-awakening bodhisattvas. "Whether effects" refers to the merits of Buddha-fruition. "Fundamental" refers to the practices of sudden-awakening bodhisattvas and the Buddha-fruition stage. "Expedient means" refers to the practices of gradual-awakening śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.

The meaning is: all uncontaminated seeds and manifest activities, conditioned and unconditioned, and the meritorious dharmas possessed by causes and effects—whether they exist within the bodies of fundamental sudden-awakening bodhisattvas and at the Buddha-fruition stage, or within the bodies of expedient gradual-awakening śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas—are comprehensively included and called the One Vehicle.

The *Kyōsui Shō* states: "Seeds of the four wisdoms, manifest activities of the ten grounds. 'Conditioned' refers to the Truth of the Path. 'Unconditioned' refers to the Truth of Cessation. 'Whether causes' refers to entering Buddha-knowledge and Buddha-vision, with the manifest activities of the ten grounds as causes. 'Whether effects' refers to the three [aspects] of opening, showing, and awakening; the three Buddha-bodies of Buddha-fruition are called effects. The true suchness of the ten grounds is called cause. Nirvana within the effects is called effect. Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna, teaching-principle-practice-fruition, uncontaminated [dharmas] capable of perfecting Buddha-virtue are all included herein," etc.

Upon examination now, saying "teaching-principle-practice-fruition" in the commentary is incorrect. It should be "object-practice-fruition," not taking "teaching-principle-practice-fruition" as this essence. This is the third essence. Therefore it should be well understood.

Question: Why is Mahāyāna called "fundamental" and Hīnayāna called "expedient means"?
Answer: Mahāyāna practice is the self-essence of the One Vehicle, therefore it is called "fundamental." Hīnayāna practice is the cause for entering Mahāyāna, therefore it is called "expedient means." It is like calling the dhyāna grounds "fundamental" and the preparatory grounds "expedient means."

Question: Why does this essence only take uncontaminated merits and not take the contaminated?
Answer: We should temporarily say that regarding essence, there is a primary essence and an auxiliary essence. Now the primary essence is mentioned without mentioning the auxiliary essence. Therefore the contaminated is not taken. When we reach the third essence, this can be understood.

Question: When it says "whether seeds refers to the seeds of the four wisdoms," what are these four wisdoms?
Answer: The Great Mirror Wisdom, etc. (as recorded below).

Question: At what stage do the manifest activities of these four wisdoms exist?
Answer: The Wisdom of Wonderful Observation and the Wisdom of Equality are attained at the first ground. Among the ten grounds there are times of manifestation and non-manifestation. The Great Mirror Wisdom and the Wisdom of Accomplishing Activities are at the Buddha-fruition stage...

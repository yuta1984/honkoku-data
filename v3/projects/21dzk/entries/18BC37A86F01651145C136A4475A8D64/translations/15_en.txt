states "84,000 yojanas." What should be taken as correct? Answer: In the above sequence of the introductory and main sections of the two sūtras, we said all were errors of the Correct Sūtra. This one matter should likewise be considered an error based on the Correct Sūtra.

Question: The Correct Sūtra states "The bodhisattva body is 42,000, the Buddha body is 84,000. The bodhisattva is half-reduced compared to the Buddha, according to worldly principles." The Wonderful Sūtra states "6.8 million yojanas. From a human perspective, guest-dust is still minimal, and there is no fault of contradicting worldly [principles]," is there not? Answer: The Lion's body measurement should differ in meaning between pure lands and defiled lands. Why? The Contemplation of Immeasurable Life Sūtra states "Amitābha's body measurement is 600 trillion nayuta Ganges-sand yojanas, Avalokiteśvara's body measurement is 8 billion nayuta yojanas." Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha's land is already a pure land, and with Amitābha Buddha's land, their meaning is the same.

Question: That commentary on the Contemplation of Immeasurable Life Sūtra [states] "Ganges-sand is a translator's error. Since it already states 'eyes like the measurement of the four great oceans' - 20,000 yojanas, altogether 80,000 yojanas. Only 600 trillion nayuta Ganges-sand eyes are extremely deep." What serves as the standard interpretation? Answer: This commentary master had not seen the Correct Mindfulness of Dharma Sūtra. That sūtra states "Beyond the four outer oceans whose taste is saltier than this, there are mountains where people dwell. Beyond that there is an ocean using ghee as water. Thus extending to the realm where sunlight does not shine." How could this also be 80,000 yojanas? Therefore the Correct Sūtra, translated according to the sahā defiled land, is also considered erroneous. Question: Why do the Buddha and bodhisattvas of defiled lands have proportional body characteristics, while the Buddha and bodhisattvas of pure lands are not proportional? Answer: The measurements of worlds cannot be calculated. In the Avataṃsaka Sūtra's explanation of various worlds, some take all world languages and sounds as their substance, some worlds have

sentient beings dwelling horizontally, called "inverted worlds," some worlds have beings dwelling upright, called "covered worlds," like hanging upside down. Such worlds are beyond the scope of measurement. Worlds that take sound as their substance are difficult for thought to reach. Also, the prone dwelling of covered world sentient beings is also inconceivable. Imagining that world, what one thinks falls should be thought to rise. Now, to argue that the body measurements of defiled land buddhas and bodhisattvas cannot be proportional is because one is accustomed to the body measurements of defiled land buddhas and bodhisattvas and does not know that world's customs.

Question: Other schools cite the text from this chapter about "Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna being present in the seven-jeweled stupa coming to hear the Dharma" to prove the meaning within the Entrustment Sūtra. Should our school permit this? Answer: It should not. Regarding this, when Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound came to this realm, he already asked whether World-Honored Prabhūtaratna had come. If the jeweled stupa opens its doors and the two Buddhas sit together, Wonderful Sound's inquiry seems useless. If so, other schools' proof of "asking whether the Buddha has come" accords well with the sūtra text.

Resolving: The present doubt is Master Fan's proof of "asking whether the Buddha has come." The Doctrinal Decision's resolution states: "The questioner is transmitting the Buddha's words... it is not Wonderful Sound's own question. Therefore it is inadmissible." The meaning is: when the buddha of another realm commanded an attendant to pose questions, since [the Buddha] was not present, therefore [the attendant] asked about Vulture Peak's ceremony. Wonderful Sound transmitted those words, not saying he saw the Buddha's body. Thus saying it was not Wonderful Sound's own question. Therefore taking this as proof does not accord with the sūtra's original meaning.

The Doctrinal Decision states: "Five: The proof of 'asking whether the Buddha has come' is inadmissible. Why? Mañjuśrī requested to see Wonderful Sound, and Śākyamuni Tathāgata said 'Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna shall manifest that matter for you all.' Prabhūtaratna Buddha told Wonderful Sound: 'Good son, come. Mañjuśrī wishes to meet you.' Having come and received the Buddha's summons, how could he hypothetically ask? The questioner was transmitting the Buddha's words, therefore the sūtra states 'Pure Flower Wisdom Buddha inquired of the World-Honored One, and also asked whether Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna was listening to the Dharma.' It was not Wonderful Sound's own question. Therefore it is inadmissible."

Question: What is the meaning of the sūtra text "I only wish the World-Honored One would show me and let me see"? Answer: It means that when Wonderful Sound came to this land, let me see Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna. Regarding this, since Wonderful Sound's coming to this land depended on Prabhūtaratna's summons, he should naturally be able to see that Buddha. Why request Śākyamuni's assistance? Moreover, with such text, the Entrustment chapter states "return and add as before," which would mean the jeweled stupa closes its doors. If so, other schools' proof of "wanting to see Prabhūtaratna" seems to have basis.

Resolving: The present difficulty concerns other teachers' meaning of the "wanting to see Prabhūtaratna" proof. The Doctrinal Decision explains its inadmissibility: "Bodhisattvas are inferior beings, Tathāgatas are superior fruits. With assistance to enable seeing, one can behold the honored one. If not yet assisted, then one cannot see. Hoping for the Buddha's assistance, therefore requesting to want to see. Moreover, when Wonderful Sound was about to arrive, Mañjuśrī still requested the Buddha's assistance. When Wonderful Sound was already present, consequently being able to see required Buddha's power. Therefore, though sitting together, only after requesting could he see. This is not requesting to see immediately proving the stupa is closed, therefore it is inadmissible." The meaning states: dividing superior and inferior positions, excellence and inferiority are vastly different. Being below and knowing the above necessarily awaits the assistance of superior sages. Wonderful

Sound wanting to see Prabhūtaratna should most appropriately request such assistance. Mañjuśrī wanting to see Wonderful Sound sought Śākyamuni's majestic power. Both being in the causal stage are still like this - how much more so regarding Wonderful Sound and Prabhūtaratna? Generally great sages have hidden and manifest spiritual powers, and according to temporal appropriateness, sometimes hide, sometimes manifest. Prabhūtaratna initially hid his body, causing Wonderful Sound not to see, therefore he requested "show me and let me see." Hence the Xuanzan states: "Though Prabhūtaratna and Śākyamuni sit together in the stupa, spiritual power conceals and obscures, causing him not to see, therefore he requests to see him." If according to other schools, because the stupa closes its doors, Wonderful Sound requests to see. After the Entrustment chapter, permanently closed and never opening, Wonderful Sound's request would be in vain and should cease. Therefore we know that in the sūtra the stupa was originally open, temporarily hiding Prabhūtaratna's body. Therefore, depending on the request, he consequently manifested and caused Wonderful Sound to see. However, regarding Wonderful Sound coming to this realm, though later there was Prabhūtaratna's command, initially it depended on Śākyamuni's light emission. Why didn't Wonderful Sound request Śākyamuni's assistance?

Further inquiry: If inferior positions seeing the superior necessarily depend on assistance, why did Wonderful Sound readily see the World-Honored One without waiting for such assistance? Answer: Śākyamuni is the teaching master. Originally present in this land, all assemblies equally approach and make offerings. Also being a present Buddha, his body does not hide. Prabhūtaratna is a guest Buddha from another realm, a Buddha long extinct. Causing others to see him is not easy. Therefore when Wonderful Sound came, regarding the two Buddhas, he could neither see nor hear.

Question: Taking Mañjuśrī's request to see Wonderful Sound as an example does not accord with the text. Therefore the sūtra states: "I only wish the World-Honored One, with spiritual power, let that bodhisattva come so I may see him." Mañjuśrī only requested to have Wonderful Sound come. If he comes he can necessarily be seen, therefore requesting his arrival, consequently showing they should meet. The text

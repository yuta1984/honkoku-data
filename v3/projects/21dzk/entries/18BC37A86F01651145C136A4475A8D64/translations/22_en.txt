According to the two doctrines of whether the great compassionate icchantika attains Buddhahood or not, this should be reconciled through the expedient and the real.
The Xuanzan states: (As above.)

Question: Can one who recites and contemplates Avalokiteśvara transform fixed karma that must be experienced? The Xuanzan has two interpretations, taking the interpretation of "transformation" as correct. Regarding this, since it is called "fixed karma that must be experienced," even with the power of reciting Avalokiteśvara's name, how can it be easily transformed? If one forcibly permits the transformation of fixed karma, what difference would there be from unfixed karma? Therefore, in the Eleven-Faced Sūtra it states "except for fixed evil karma that must ripen." Based on this, even Avalokiteśvara's威 power does not transform fixed karma. Moreover, even when Aṅgulimāla reached the stage of no-more-learning, he still experienced fierce fire, and when the five hundred Śākya clan members attained the first fruit, they could not escape harm from King Virūḍhaka. That fixed karma is difficult to transform can be known from this. How is this?

Answer: Regarding whether fixed karma can be transformed or not, the Xuanzan has two interpretations, judging the first interpretation as good and taking the interpretation of transformation. The Yogācāra treatise states "Fixed karma to be experienced is established based on those not yet liberated," and the Nirvana Sūtra explains "Those who have not yet entered the Buddha Dharma are called fixed karma; if they enter the Buddha Dharma, it is called unfixed karma." King Ajātaśatru committed patricide, and although it was fixed karma for the hell of incessant suffering, by hearing the Mahāyāna teaching he obtained confession and remission, and furthermore attained patient acceptance. There are texts and evidence that should not be sought differently. Among these, the path of subduing and the path of elimination can extinguish the obstructions of afflictions. If there were no transformative meaning for fixed karma at all, sentient beings in transmigration would have no period for attaining sagely results. However, regarding Aṅgulimāla, according to the Xuanzan's intention, when receiving karmic results, he was still dwelling in the ordinary

stage, or had the first or second fruits. Since he would definitely attain arhatship in this life, the name is established accordingly. Or the no-more-learning sage manifested karmic results through transformation, not actual evil results. The Śākya clan of Kapilavastu were first-fruit sages. There is no fault in receiving actual results. This means that the karma for individual retribution had not yet been eliminated at the first fruit stage. Also, not having heard the Mahāyāna and lacking deep repentance, they still received karmic results. The Eleven-Faced Sūtra mentions those with weak minds. If one upholds it with utmost sincerity, one can avoid receiving everything. The Xuanzan's explanation of the Mahāprajñāpāramitā states this principle. This can be known by reference to that.

Further inquiry: Even after reconciling the Eleven-Faced Sūtra, there are still doubts. The custom of various sūtras is to praise benefits to make people believe and accept. They almost carry hidden meanings while revealing rare upholding, but regarding actual benefits, nothing should be completely concealed. Yet it explains "except for fixed evil karma that must be experienced" because the power of Dharma does not extend to it. Why easily reconcile this by saying it speaks of those with weak minds? The Mahāyāna treatise collections like Daśabhūmi and Abhidharma determine and judge characteristics, stating "Creating karma definitely receives results. Definitely, even the awesome spiritual powers of all Buddhas cannot transform it." Clearly knowing that the true meaning of Mahāyāna does not transform fixed karma. Moreover, so many Śākya clan members of Kapilavastu had already proven sagely results, exhausted the view-delusions of the three realms, became relatives of the World-Honored One with guidance surpassing others. When Venerable Maudgalyāyana wanted to apply three kinds of rescue methods with great supernatural powers, the Buddha asked Maudgalyāyana: "Can you transform fixed karma?" The venerable one considered reality and withdrew three times. Then it was known that once fixed karma has ripened, it does not depend on sagely results nor is constrained by Buddha's power. The awesome power of Prajñā and the functions of divine mantras all cannot transform it. The sages of various stages with characteristics and certified results do not take away that path. Only King Ajātaśatru could be a provisional person,

and the evidence is not singular. If it were a bodhisattva's manifestation, it would not be sufficient as evidence.

Answer: Depending on afflictions to create karma, depending on karma to experience results - the greatest power lies in discriminating afflictions. Yet the first fruit of Hīnayāna still cuts off the view-delusions of the three realms. The evil-destiny karma corresponding to view-delusions is permanently severed without remainder. The five hundred Śākya clan members all severed this. If the power of fixed karma did not reach the path of remedy, how could it be permanently severed? The remaining various karmas can be known by reference to this. Also, bodhisattvas of the stages of accumulating provisions and preparatory practices are called "the stage of diminishing power and increasing capacity for transformation." This is because they diminish the power of defiled seeds in the ālaya consciousness and increase the capacity of pure seeds within the ālaya consciousness. Gradually and suddenly subduing the seeds of the two obstructions, what fixed karma necessarily attracts suffering results? Those above the patient acceptance stage of the two vehicles still do not fall into evil destinies. How much more so for bodhisattvas? Even if not yet entered into the incalculable eon, gradually there can be the power of repentance. Even if King Ajātaśatru were a provisional being, regarding the manifestational aspect, it still all accords with characteristics. The various sūtras' exclusion of the power of fixed karma is perhaps to encourage vigorous minds or to eliminate thoughts of pride and arrogance. The Abhidharma treatise scholars' discussion of karmic power refers to the aspect of not yet having repented. The Śākya clan suffered harm because, although the Buddha was in the world, they still dwelled in small fruits and had not yet entered the Mahāyāna. The remaining various difficulties can be known by reference to this.

The Xuanzan states: "The ninth fascicle of Yogācāra explains that there are two types of karma. First is fixed retribution karma, namely intentional karma - karma that is created and increased. Second is unfixed retribution karma, namely karma that is intentionally created but not increased. Or previously increased karma that, through later regret and such, is called non-increasing karma. Like calling it increasing karma before Ajātaśatru's regret, and calling it non-increasing karma after regret. The sixtieth fascicle explains that fixed karma to be experienced is established regarding those not yet liberated. This is the same as the Nirvana Sūtra (31st fascicle): 'Those not yet entered into Buddha Dharma are called fixed karma; if entered into Buddha Dharma, it is called unfixed karma.' Therefore, through the good condition of reciting Avalokiteśvara, one is nourished,

and through the mind's regret and remorse, all sufferings are escaped. There is also the interpretation that says non-increasing and unfixed karma can obtain transformation and extinction. For the three-time fixed karma and those with fixed retribution but unfixed time, one can only make them lighter, not completely cause extinction. The Diamond Prajñāpāramitā states: 'Previous life sinful karma should fall into evil paths, but due to the power of upholding the sūtra, one is despised by people, and previous life sinful karma is immediately extinguished, and one should attain bodhi.' It does not say complete extinction. Also, the Sūtra of the Wise and Foolish and the Aṅgulimāla Sūtra state that although attaining arhatship, due to present karma having results, one was burned by fire. It also explains that in Kapilavastu city, except for one child, all other men and women were first-fruit sages. They should not have been killed by Virūḍhaka. Even the Buddha did not prevent that fixed created karma. How much more so regarding receiving results? Calling it unfixed for liberated persons is explained based on unfixed karma. This is also not so. If one attains arhatship, all unwholesomeness is exhausted. What karma would receive results? At the first and second fruits, unwholesomeness is not yet exhausted. It does not obstruct those fruits. What prevents also receiving? The Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra does not speak of complete extinction but mentions those with weak minds. If one upholds that sūtra with utmost sincerity and earnestness, one receives nothing at all. If not so, the five heinous crimes are all fixed karma. How did King Ajātaśatru repent and already receive nothing at all? The Daśabhūmi Treatise states: 'First is fixed in terms of experiencing retribution, second is fixed in terms of creating karma. What the awesome spiritual powers of Buddhas cannot transform refers to those who do not themselves generate minds of regret and remorse and do not enter the noble path - for them karma and results are fixed. It is not that after regret and remorse it can still be called fixed karma.' The Dharmapada states: 'Not in emptiness

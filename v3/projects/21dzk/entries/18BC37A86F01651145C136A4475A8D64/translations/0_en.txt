　Entrustment Chapter
Question: In the Xuanzan commentary, it states "According to the fundamental treatise, this chapter comes after the Samantabhadra chapter." If so, by what text in the treatise is this meaning proven?

Regarding the treatise text quoted in Xuanzan about "protective power of Dharma refers to the text demonstrating Samantabhadra and subsequent chapters," the treatise text is not without error. It's like saying the sūtra is correct and the treatise is mistaken. Who would know? Bodhiruci and Ratnamati, following the Saddharma-puṇḍarīka, added the words "subsequent chapter" themselves. Moreover, regarding the treatise's determination of chapter sequence, it speaks of the Dharma Teacher, Comfortable Conduct, and Encouragement to Uphold chapters demonstrating the power of upholding. How could one place Encouragement to Uphold before Comfortable Conduct? Therefore, Zhanran reconciled the "subsequent chapter" text, sometimes calling it "untranslated chapters," sometimes pointing to the Samantabhadra Sūtra. Otherwise, why not directly match it with Entrustment, but laboriously say "subsequent chapter"? This explanation is most reasonable. How about it?

Response: The text about Samantabhadra and subsequent chapters already points to subsequent chapters in relation to the Encouragement chapter. If not Entrustment, what other chapter could it be? Moreover, countless bodhisattvas, having received the touching of heads and entrustment, join palms and raise their voices, saying they will fully carry out the World-Honored One's instructions as commanded. The characteristics of protective Dharma power are clearly explained. What the treatise master points to is truly without doubt. To carelessly call it erroneous - what reason is there for this? However, saying "the sūtra is correct and the treatise mistaken" is among two explanations, where the force of meaning leads to providing an additional explanation. Moreover, regarding one passage in the sūtra, comparing current editions with treatise citations, sometimes saying "all Buddhas," sometimes saying "bodhisattvas" - their language already differs, so it's necessary to rely on one text. Therefore, based on the superiority of reasoning, the treatise is deemed mistaken. This explains the treatise text. Mistaken in relation to what? Also, like various sūtra texts, it should be relied upon throughout, not mistaken at all. Regarding the sequence of Comfortable Conduct and Encouragement to Uphold in the power of upholding, the text has no words showing sequence. In protective Dharma power, it properly says "and subsequent chapters." That is light, this is heavy; that is dark, this is clear. One should not use that to confuse this. Regarding Miaolejue's reconciling explanation, it completely misses the point. The meaning of the twenty-eight chapters is complete - what is lacking? How can one carelessly claim there are untranslated chapters? Moreover, the Tiantai school takes Kumārajīva's translation as its standard, preserving the meaning within the sūtra, relying on that one text. Even if there were untranslated texts that Kumārajīva didn't know or translate, that school's foundation would become empty. Regarding pointing to the Samantabhadra Sūtra, calling a separate sūtra a chapter of this sūtra not only lacks reason but has no precedent. If this were so, could the Infinite Meanings Sūtra be called a previous chapter? Moreover, the single Entrustment chapter lacks inclusion in the sixty-four sections. Our school, following text and principle, makes it the subsequent chapter and protective Dharma power. But that school defers to untranslated texts, defers to other sūtras, abandoning the one existing chapter. Comparing both sides, how are the gains and losses?

The treatise says:

Question: The sūtra text states "Then Śākyamuni Buddha rose from the Dharma seat and manifested great supernatural power." Does "great supernatural power" refer to the supernatural power manifested in the previous chapter? There are arguments on both sides. If it refers to the previous chapter, looking at the complete sūtra text: "manifested great supernatural power, and with his right hand touched the heads of countless bodhisattva-mahāsattvas." The supernatural power and head-touching appear continuous. According to our school's understanding, the Entrustment chapter is at the end of the sūtra, so we know it doesn't refer to the Supernatural Powers chapter. If not so, since this chapter doesn't separately manifest supernatural power, and if it's not the previous chapter's supernatural power, what does "manifesting great supernatural power" refer to? Therefore, Xuanzan explains this chapter's significance: "Above, supernatural power was used to make them believe in entrustment; this chapter uses head-touching to make them practice entrustment." It's clear that supernatural power refers to the previous chapter's supernatural power. Do human teachers explain it this way accordingly?

Response: The Supernatural Powers and Entrustment chapters are far apart. How can one point to tongue signs and other supernatural powers as the reason for this chapter's head-touching entrustment? Moreover, looking at the text: "rose from the Dharma seat, manifested great supernatural power, and with the right hand touched..." Using one hand to touch countless bodhisattvas' heads, this head-touching itself is called supernatural power. Moreover, in the Supernatural Powers chapter it says "sitting on the lion seat in the jeweled stupa." When the two World-Honored Ones sat together on the jeweled seat, Śākyamuni manifested great supernatural power. But in this chapter, supernatural power is manifested after rising from the jeweled seat. Know that what this chapter calls "manifesting great supernatural power" doesn't refer to the Supernatural Powers chapter's explanation. Even if reconciling the previous chapter's text, this chapter should most properly have text saying "after manifesting supernatural power, the head-touching was done." Since there are no such words, there's no need for dispute. However, the Xuanzan text temporarily explains according to the current chapter sequence. Therefore Xuanzan says "according to the current sequence of upholding chapters" etc. Using the first sentence to clarify chapter sequence, the Entrustment chapter is placed at the end.

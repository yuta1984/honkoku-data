These activities correspond to the fourth sovereignty of karma. Spiritual powers would be the eighth sovereignty of spiritual power. Why is it specifically called "spiritual power sovereignty"?

Answer: Since the sutra already states "universally manifesting spiritual powers at the universal gate," why would it not be spiritual power sovereignty? The fourth karma sovereignty means receiving karmic results according to time. Discussing the meaning by contrasting karma and its results would not at all correspond to the present explanation.

The Xuanzan states: "Speaking of 'sovereignty,' both the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha and Avataṃsaka explain ten kinds... Fourth, karma sovereignty means receiving results according to time... Eighth, spiritual power sovereignty means manifesting all spiritual transformations... This is precisely spiritual power sovereignty, universally demonstrating all gates."

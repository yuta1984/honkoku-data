Why does it draw other body faculties? This constitutes object deterioration. Third, when both root and object deteriorate: this is like when eye consciousness takes the three objects of fragrance, taste, and touch. The eye faculty is a faculty of separation. When it takes other objects of contact, this is root deterioration. These three objects properly draw the three faculties of nose, tongue, and body, but when they conversely draw the other eye faculty of separation, this constitutes object deterioration.

Question: When the meditative wisdom associated with the sixth consciousness depends on the nose faculty to cognize fragrance objects of the great thousand-fold world, can the nose faculty similarly take objects of the three-thousand-fold world? If it can, the Xuanzan states: "Meditative wisdom knows from afar. Because it takes depending on the nose faculty, it is called 'hearing fragrance.' It is not that the nose can actually take objects in separation." Since it already states "it is not that the nose can actually take objects in separation," we know that consciousness alone takes distant objects while the nose faculty does not take them. If this is so, then if the nose faculty does not illuminate fragrances of the great thousand-fold world, how can it serve as a gate for consciousness? Moreover, the sutra text states "yet regarding the nose faculty, it neither deteriorates nor errs." If the nose faculty does not take, why discuss the matter of deterioration or non-deterioration? Based on this, Master Zishou's commentary states: "Through the power of dharma, the nose faculty illuminates the three-thousand-fold world." How should this be understood?

Response: The nose faculty does not properly take distant objects. For a non-contact faculty to take what does not reach it would deteriorate the root's nature. Therefore the Xuanzan states: "It is not that the nose can actually take objects in separation." It also states: "If the root knows from afar, because it takes without contact, it deteriorates the root but not the object." However, because that root is pure and possesses excellent functions, it stimulates consciousness to take distant objects. The five faculties and five consciousnesses illuminate the aspectual images transformed by the sixth consciousness. The aspects

[Right Lower Section]
still remain in nearby locations, without the fault of taking separated objects. The definitive interpretation of the sutra text, by naming it "nose faculty purity," reveals its excellent capacity. Now properly discussing the characteristics of dharma, we should understand through reality.

Now I say: distant fragrance objects are not what the nose faculty properly takes. Generally, whether root and object reach each other is naturally determined by dharma. For contaminated roots and objects, their functions do not change. Even if reaching the ground stage where they can freely function interchangeably, they still do not violate the characteristics of separation and contact. How much less would a nose faculty at the ordinary stage take distant fragrances of the great thousand-fold world. Therefore the Xuanzan cites the treatise passage "this is a wisdom object, known by the nose faculty" and states "it cannot actually take objects in separation." When the sutra says "neither deteriorates nor errs," this is within the general praise of various virtues, meaning that while good, bad, strong, and excellent unusual fragrances should damage the nose faculty, through the power of upholding sutras, though taking them, it does not deteriorate. It is not praising distant fragrances. The Realm and Base chapter mentions faculties to reveal consciousness—what contradiction is there?

Question: Looking at the Xuanzan, regarding distant fragrances, it does not take real objects but can take false objects. Even if false and似, it does not abandon the distant aspect. If so, the statement about not taking distant objects at all contradicts the interpretation's meaning. Examining by analogy, although the mutual functioning of sense faculties does not take the real objects of other sense data, it permits taking false objects. Regarding the purity of the nose faculty concerning its own sense data, discussing taking or not taking according to false or real—is this also the same? If it doesn't take false distant objects, how can we interpret the passage "obtaining pseudo-fragrances is not obtaining real substance, therefore the separated taking essence deteriorates object nature"? Viewing through the passage "therefore separated taking essence," "obtaining pseudo-fragrances" means suddenly obtaining false fragrances in separation.

Answer: The Sheshaku states regarding "pseudo-fragrances," citing the Yogācāra treatise: "In wind moving through space there are no co-arising fragrances, only false combinations." Explaining this false combination meaning: "Wind has no fundamental fragrances.

[Left Upper Section]
Like wind passing trees, the fragrances of trees, flowers, etc. follow the wind and come. Because of flowers etc., wind then has fragrance, hence called false combination." The meaning is: regarding jambu trees etc., the fundamental fragrance at the tree's location is called co-arising fragrance; the following fragrance in wind is called false combination fragrance. Investigating the essence of those fragrances, they are all real objects. However, even if we say the nose faculty hears jambu tree fragrance, it doesn't take the fundamental fragrance but can take the fragrance in wind because it's in separation, since it reaches the faculty location.

Question: Do all fragrances of the three-thousand-fold world come to the sutra upholder's location? The Sheshaku's interpretation of Xuanzan through wind-borne fragrances in space is quite incredible, so previous masters questioned and did not accept it.

Answer: The various meanings explained in sutra texts are difficult to determine. Xuanzan also reveals its meaning accordingly in response. Among these, actually knowing distant objects is the capacity of wisdom associated with meditation. When meditative wisdom knows, it transforms aspectual images and causes the nose faculty and nose consciousness to take them. Even if transformed by the meditative mind, if that faculty is not pure, it's difficult to take them. Though taking according to wisdom, this is still the excellent function of the faculty. It's not the same as ordinary beings in the desire realm seeing Brahmā's body. That is nearby object, so they can see by depending on others' meditative powers.

The meaning of the sixth consciousness's transformations can exist. However, using this meaning to name "pseudo-fragrances" contradicts the Sheshaku.

Also considering: when taking distant fragrances of the great thousand-fold world, it is only the sixth meditative wisdom. The five consciousnesses and five faculties do not take them. How do we know this? According to Xuanzan's meaning, it permits the tongue faculty to take tastes of the three-thousand-fold world. If tongue consciousness in meditation depends on the tongue faculty to take taste objects transformed by the sixth consciousness, this would already constitute consuming solid food. Since that

[Left Lower Section]
already does not actually consume but only knows taste aspects, we can understand by analogy: taking distant fragrances is the capacity of consciousness, not the sphere of the five faculties and five consciousnesses.

Question: If so, why after saying "meditative wisdom knows from afar," does it further say "taking in dependence on the nose faculty"?

Answer: Reading the text: "meditative wisdom knows from afar, taking in dependence on the nose faculty, hence called hearing fragrance." The meaning is: regarding meditative mind conditions, it explains the meaning of nose faculty purity. Wisdom associated with meditation still depends on faculty purity to freely take its objects.

Question: Since meditative mind has its own excellent functions, why does it borrow faculty power?

Answer: Although divine eye and ear powers are meditative mind, they still depend on faculty functions to take distant objects. Because the physical body's five faculties are pure, the dependent wisdom can excel over other people. Though ordinary meditative powers cognize distant objects, clearly and minutely knowing their characteristics according to objects is perhaps difficult. This should be considered according to the two approaches of whether meditative mind cognizes or doesn't cognize the five faculties. In the habit of form realms, body and mind mutually depend just like in the desire realm. Therefore, even among form realm celestial beings, if the eye, ear and other consciousnesses arising in the excellent dependent body resulting from immovable karma cannot attain mastery when the meditative mind cognizes forms, sounds, etc., then one part is the mind's own capacity and one part depends on bodily power. For sutra upholders in the desire realm, even if attaining superior meditation, why wouldn't they depend on the power of the five faculties' purity?

The Xuanzan states: "Upper and lower being already distant, how can they know? If the faculty knows from afar, because it takes without contact, it deteriorates the root but not the object. If reaching enables taking, how could all fragrances come to the faculty? The treatise states: 'This is wisdom's object. Because the nose faculty knows.' Meditative wisdom knows from afar. Because it takes depending on the nose faculty, it is called hearing fragrance. It is not that the nose actually

     Never Disparaging Chapter
Question: Is Never Disparaging's practice the same as the Four Peaceful Practices, or how is it?
     As in the Peaceful Practices Chapter commentary.

The Xuanzan states: "There are four meanings for its arrival. First, although there are six chapters for those who can learn the practices, they are divided into four sections. This is the fourth, clarifying how the Buddha himself in the past dwelt in the causal position, practiced peaceful practices, cultivated patience and so forth, propagated this sutra, and should attain peace. Now explaining this sutra to encourage the contemporary assembly, this chapter comes... Third, wanting to reveal that the威勢 of practicing peaceful practices is incomparable. When I became Never Disparaging and practiced peaceful practices, sentient beings at that time acted to harm me. Though initially receiving suffering, through my power in return, they all attained Buddhahood."

     Miaoле challenges the Xuanzan and records ten differences between peaceful [practices] and Never Disparaging. The private record contains this. It should be seen.

Question: The sutra text states "obtaining great sinful retribution as previously explained." What chapter does "previously explained" refer to?
Proceeding to say: The Parable Chapter. Regarding this, though the Parable Chapter explains the karma of slandering the Dharma, it doesn't clarify the sin of slandering sutra holders. Why point to that chapter? Looking at the Dharma Teachers Chapter: "If a person with one evil word slanders a householder or monk who reads and recites the Lotus Sutra, that sin is extremely grave."

[Left Lower Section]
"As previously explained" should point to this passage. Based on this, Tiantai and others point to the Dharma Teachers Chapter. How is this?

Reconciling explanation: Based on the doubt, examining the Parable Chapter verse: "Seeing those who read, recite, write and uphold the sutra, despising them and increasing jealousy while harboring resentment. Listen now again to this person's sinful retribution. When that person's life ends, they enter Avīci Hell for a complete kalpa. When the kalpa ends they are reborn again. Thus continuing in succession for countless kalpas... Because they cut off Buddha seeds, they receive this sinful retribution," etc. Those who bring contempt and jealous hatred toward the four types of Dharma teachers of reading, reciting, writing and upholding, for countless kalpas pass through the three evil paths, and even if born as humans receive various tortures. The Parable Chapter text clearly explains extensively the matter of sinful retribution for slandering sutra holders. Though the Dharma Teachers Chapter expresses the gravity of sin, it doesn't yet clarify the characteristics of sinful retribution. What this chapter points to most appropriately corresponds to the Parable Chapter. Other schools' explanations should be compared and understood.

The sutra states: "If monks, nuns, laymen or laywomen who uphold the Lotus Sutra encounter evil speech, cursing, slander and defamation, they obtain great sinful retribution as previously explained."

The Xuanzan states: "The sin is as in the previous Parable Chapter."

The Parable Chapter sutra states: "Whether when the Buddha is in the world or after his extinction, if there is slander of such a sutra as this, seeing those who read, recite, write and uphold the sutra, despising and hating them with jealousy while harboring resentment - listen now again to this person's sinful retribution. When that person's life ends they enter Avīci Hell for a complete kalpa. When the kalpa ends they are reborn again. Thus continuing in succession for countless kalpas. Born from other hells, they should fall into animal [realms]."

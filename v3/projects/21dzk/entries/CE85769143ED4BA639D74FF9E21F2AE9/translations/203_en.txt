can take objects in separation. Moreover, when the various faculties function interchangeably, even the nose can see colors. How much more would wisdom depending on eye and ear not take fragrances of the great thousand-fold world? Obtaining pseudo-fragrances is not obtaining real substance. Though permitting separated taking essence, it deteriorates object nature.

The Sheshaku states: "The commentary's 'this is wisdom's object, known by the nose faculty' means that wisdom associated with the sixth consciousness can know by depending on the nose faculty. That too is because the nose faculty knows."

The Kyōsui-shō states: "This is a mental factor associated with the sixth consciousness, specifically wisdom among the particular objects. Wisdom together with the six mind-kings, directed toward the nose faculty gate, depends on the nose faculty to cognize fragrances of upper realms. Question: Since consciousness and wisdom know, this is wisdom. Why does the sutra say the nose faculty takes fragrance objects? Answer: Because wisdom takes fragrance objects by depending on the nose faculty, it is named 'nose faculty hearing' according to what it depends on. In reality, the nose faculty only cognizes contact-knowledge objects and cannot take fragrances of upper realms. Fragrances of upper realms also do not come to the nose faculty. This is simply wisdom associated with consciousness hearing from afar. Therefore the commentary states: 'It is not that the nose can actually take objects in separation.'"

The Realm-Base Chapter states: "Question: If so, why do nose faculties etc. of the desire realm hear fragrances of the formless realm etc.? Answer: Because of their mutual functioning, because this is wisdom's object, because of dharma's power."

The Fifteenth Volume Private Record Nine states: "Question: The commentary's next passage about 'Indra teaching dharma, hearing fragrances and knowing, etc.' - obtaining pseudo-fragrances but not real fragrances - what is called pseudo-fragrance? Answer: The Sheshaku Fourth cites Yogācāra texts saying 'wind-borne fragrances in space are pseudo-fragrances.'" However, fearing this contradicts the Pivotal Essentials

and main commentary. However, examining the commentary text: "Upper and lower being already distant... taking objects in separation." This explanation means: the bodhisattva's sixth consciousness meditative wisdom becomes nose consciousness, forming a clear faculty. Investigating, it depends on the nose faculty to know heavenly fragrances. Investigating, because this takes depending on the nose, it is called hearing fragrance. It is not that the nose faculty actually takes distant fragrances. The commentary also states: "Moreover, the various faculties' mutual functioning... deteriorates object nature." This explanation means: through the bodhisattva's freely functioning mutual-use power, the nose faculty universally takes the five objects. The remaining faculties like eye and ear are also mutually thus. Exhaustively reasoning here, we can say the nose faculty obtaining nearby fragrances are real fragrances. If taking heavenly fragrances that don't reach, those pseudo-fragrances are not real fragrances. We can specifically say: seeing Indra's form - pseudo-form knowing dharma-teaching's meaning - pseudo-dharma, hearing dharma-teaching's sound - pseudo-sound, knowing soft touches - pseudo-touch, knowing heavenly tastes - pseudo-taste. The nose faculty takes such multiple objects. However, the commentary randomly mentions one object saying it obtains pseudo-fragrances. Alternatively, because all are known by the nose, it calls them pseudo-fragrances according to the faculty. Question: Why call them pseudo-fragrances? Answer: According to the first meaning, heavenly substantial fragrances don't come here. Though not coming, through autonomous power one can know them, so because they're not heavenly substances, they're called false. However, because they resemble those substances, they're called pseudo-forms. Also, because not knowing the upper substances, they're called false. However, because resembling those substances, they're called pseudo. The remaining sounds etc. are also thus. The latter meaning: the nose faculty knows heavenly objects, hears ear-object sounds, sees eye-object forms, etc. Because these are the nose faculty's doings, they're falsely called fragrances. The remaining faculties can be understood by mutual analogy. Also, these are objects known by reasoning. Because known depending on the nose faculty, false fragrances; because known depending on the ear

faculty, they're called pseudo-sounds. The rest can be known by analogy. The Sheshaku Fourth states: "The commentary's 'deteriorating faculties but not objects' means the meaning of being free from deterioration and disorder. All below should be understood analogously. The meaning of mutual functioning is as in the Consciousness-Only Commentary. 'This is wisdom's object, known by the nose faculty'... the essence of fragrance." From the Sheshaku: "Now pseudo-fragrances means fragrances that come following wind separate from substantial objects, hence called false. I think this is not so. Wind-borne fragrances in space don't come here, so this contradicts the Abhidharmakośa treatise text. That treatise states: 'In the Thirty-three Heavens, at the northeast corner of Indra's Good Dharma Hall, there are two fragrances of the pārijāta tree. This tree's fragrance travels forty li with the wind, two li against the wind.'" However, since it takes a year to fall from the Thirty-three Heavens' great mountain to this realm, wind-borne fragrances seem to contradict the treatise text.

Question: When people with pure nose faculties take fragrances of the three-thousand-fold world, these are pseudo-fragrances. How does Master Kuiji explain the essence of pseudo-fragrances? Advancing the argument: In wind moving through space, falsely combined fragrances are called pseudo-fragrances. Regarding this, looking at the Xuanzan, it cites the treatise passage "this is wisdom's object, known by the nose faculty" and states "meditative wisdom knows from afar... obtains pseudo-fragrances, not real substance." It means the sixth meditative wisdom knows distant fragrances from afar and transforms pseudo-objects. Even with good, bad and other fragrances, because they're transformed by the sixth consciousness, they're called pseudo. Why speak of wind-borne fragrances? Among the six desires and four dhyāna fragrances, how do they follow wind to this realm? Therefore ancient masters like Kanri don't accept the Sheshaku's meaning. How should this be understood?

Explanation: As the questioning suggests, what's transformed by sixth meditative wisdom is called pseudo-fragrance. "The nose cannot actually

[Left Lower Section]
take objects in separation" means: regarding the substantial objects of nose consciousness, among two types, what originally depends on transformations by the base consciousness is called real objects; what newly depends on transformations by the sixth consciousness in superior stages is called pseudo. This accords with dharma characteristics. That faculty being pure universally takes immeasurable fragrance particles of the three-thousand great thousand-fold world. How could they all depend on wind in space to come to the dharma teacher's dwelling? The Sheshaku simply shows there are types of pseudo-fragrances regarding fragrance objects, not necessarily limiting to this.

Investigation: The Sheshaku's concluding passage says "false because falsely combined." The commentary's statement about obtaining the false is precisely the Yogācāra treatise's wind-borne fragrances in space, explaining not obtaining the real substance of fundamental fragrances. Beginning and end seem quite difficult to reconcile.

There is a separate interpretation that can be analogized to the above meaning.

The Sheshaku states: "Regarding the commentary's 'obtaining pseudo-fragrances, etc.' Question: The various teachings don't show fragrances having falseness. How can it speak of obtaining pseudo-fragrances? Answer: According to the Yogācāra treatise, good and bad fragrances etc. are called real; combined fragrances etc. are false. Therefore the fifty-fourth states: 'In wind moving through space, there are no co-arising fragrances, only false combinations.' Since it speaks of false combinations, we know this is false. Question: What are the characteristics of falsely combined fragrances in wind moving through space? Answer: Wind has no fundamental fragrances. Like wind passing trees, fragrances of trees, flowers, etc. follow the wind and come. Because of flowers etc., wind then has fragrance, hence called false combination. False because falsely combined. The commentary's statement about obtaining pseudo-fragrances, namely Yogācāra's wind-borne fragrances in space not obtaining reality, means not obtaining the essence of fundamental fragrances."

The Fifteenth Volume Private Record states as above.

Secret Dharma of the Benevolent Kings Sutra Influenced by Śākyamuni, Volume Two

Chapter Two: Contemplating Emptiness

To explain this chapter, I will divide it into three sections: the reason for its coming, explaining the name, and entering the text with doctrinal analysis.

First, the reason for its coming: In the previous Prologue Chapter, Śākyamuni of wondrous enlightenment entered the concentration of the ten grounds. King Prasenajit, Vimalakīrti, and the cloud-sea assembly each harbored doubts, wondering what the Tathāgata intended to accomplish by entering the concentration of the ten grounds and emitting light. Now in the Contemplating Emptiness Chapter, the Buddha tells the great assembly, knowing that the sixteen kings wish to ask about protecting the nation: "I shall first explain to the bodhisattvas the dharma of protecting the Buddha-fruit and protecting the practice of the ten grounds." This is the reason for the coming of these two chapters: the Prologue and Contemplating Emptiness.

Next, explaining the chapter name: "Contemplating Emptiness Chapter" expounds the emptiness of Buddha-fruit. Because the Buddha-fruit of the ultimate position of wondrous enlightenment is empty, it is named "Contemplating Emptiness Chapter."

Next, entering the text with doctrinal analysis: Regarding the dharma of protecting Buddha-fruit and protecting the ten grounds, even one moment of faith in the Benevolent Kings Sutra surpasses the merit of giving the seven treasures to beings throughout the three thousand worlds. The Contemplating Emptiness Chapter is the answer to the Hearing Chapter. 《Marginal note: [Investigation] The eight characters "from 'next contemplating' to 'also'" seem to have missing characters》 Generally, if one wishes to protect the nation, one should first protect the Buddha-fruit and protect the ten grounds. The heavenly beings and good spirits value this and naturally protect the nation. Next, regarding the practice of protecting Buddha-fruit: the Benevolent Kings Sutra expounds the emptiness of Buddha-fruit. Next, regarding the practice of protecting the ten grounds: the Benevolent Kings Sutra also expounds the emptiness of causes and proclaims the emptiness of Buddha-causes. However, regarding whether this Buddha-fruit is empty or not empty, there are debates among the three countries of India, China, and Japan. Nevertheless, during Śākyamuni's responsive manifestation, Chan Master Zhiyi respectfully questioned Śākyamuni. Śākyamuni proclaimed: "Clinging to the emptiness of Buddha-fruit cannot exhaust my meaning. Also clinging to the non-emptiness of Buddha-fruit cannot understand this meaning. You should know that Buddha-fruit is both empty and not empty. Why?

Buddha-fruit is like empty space. Within empty space there is the emptiness of Buddha-fruit. That Buddha-fruit is both empty and not empty is because worldly characteristics are eternally abiding. If worldly characteristics are eternally abiding, then one knows that dharmas are always without inherent nature. Buddha-fruit is without nature. If without nature, then Buddha-fruit is empty. The emptiness of empty space is the eternal abiding of worldly characteristics. Therefore Buddha-fruit is empty yet not empty. Also, Buddha-fruit is not empty yet empty." 《Marginal note: Above》 Japan does not know this secret dharma.

Next, the Contemplating Emptiness Chapter of the Benevolent Kings Sutra is the practice of protecting Buddha-fruit, but if one contemplates the emptiness of Buddha-fruit, how can one protect empty space? The Benevolent Kings Sutra states: "At that time the great king addressed the Buddha saying: 'World-Honored One, how does one protect Buddha-fruit and how does one protect the ten grounds?' The Buddha said: 'The nature of all dharmas is like empty space. Because prajñāpāramitā is empty, all dharmas are empty: internal emptiness, external emptiness, internal-external emptiness, conditioned emptiness, unconditioned emptiness, beginningless emptiness, nature emptiness, ultimate truth emptiness, cause emptiness, Buddha-fruit emptiness. Great king, the bodhisattva's cultivation of protecting Buddha-fruit is like this.'" 《Marginal note: Above》 Bodhisattvas practicing prajñā only contemplate all dharma-nature and empty space. Therefore the Scroll of Śākyamuni's Influence states: "Zhiyi said: 'If bodhisattvas practicing prajñā only contemplate empty space, how do they cultivate myriad practices and myriad virtues?' The answer says: 'The various sutras speak of planting trees in empty space. It is also like looking up at empty space and painting a palace.' Thus even 'Beings are limitless, I vow to liberate them' liberates empty space. One writes and paints 'liberating beings' in empty space. 'Afflictions are limitless, I vow to cut them off' also cuts off empty space. One writes and paints 'cutting off afflictions' in empty space. 'Dharma gates are limitless, I vow to know them' also knows empty space. One writes and paints 'knowing dharma gates' in empty space. 'Supreme bodhi, I vow to realize it' also realizes empty space. One writes 'realizing bodhi' in empty space. The six pāramitās also give to empty space. One writes and paints 'giving' in empty space. The precept pāramitā also upholds empty space. One writes and paints 'upholding precepts' in empty space. The patience pāramitā also endures empty space's

humiliation. One writes and paints 'patience' in empty space. The vigor pāramitā also advances vigorously in empty space. One writes and paints 'vigor' in empty space. The meditation pāramitā also enters empty space. One writes and paints 'sitting meditation' in empty space. The prajñā pāramitā also studies empty space. One writes and paints 'wisdom' in empty space. Practicing empty space in this way is the practice of the ten grounds and the practice of Buddha-fruit. The ten grounds are the sixteen 《Marginal note: [Investigation] 'six' is probably the character 'ground'》 of empty space, Buddha-fruit is the summit of empty space." 《Marginal note: Above》 This should be kept secret. Japan does not know prajñā practice. Keep it secret, keep it secret.

The Matter of Twenty Emptinesses Cultivation Secret Dharma

Next, regarding the contemplation of emptiness in the Contemplating Emptiness Chapter of the Benevolent Kings Sutra. The sutra states: "All dharmas empty, internal emptiness, external emptiness, internal-external emptiness, conditioned emptiness, unconditioned emptiness, beginningless emptiness, nature emptiness, ultimate truth emptiness, cause, Buddha-fruit emptiness." 《Marginal note: Above》 The Scroll of Śākyamuni's Influence states: "Internal emptiness, external emptiness, etc. are taught for dull-rooted beings who cling to dharmas. Sharp-rooted beings contemplate that everything is empty space. Empty space has no internal empty space, and empty space also has no external empty space or conditioned [dharmas]. Also, sudden enlightenment is sudden enlightenment awakening." 《Marginal note: Above》 Keep it secret, keep it secret.

The Matter of the Buddha Attaining the Three Fearless Fruits Secret Dharma

The Contemplating Emptiness Chapter sutra states: "The Buddha attains the three fearless fruits: analytical cessation 《Marginal note: analytical cessation unconditioned》, non-analytical cessation 《Marginal note: non-analytical cessation unconditioned》, empty space sarvajña fruit emptiness." 《Marginal note: empty space unconditioned, etc.》《Marginal note: Above》

Generally, the three unconditioned are: first, analytical cessation unconditioned, also called numerical cessation unconditioned. The Tang Tripiṭaka translator named it analytical cessation unconditioned. Second, non-analytical cessation unconditioned, also called non-numerical cessation unconditioned. The Tang Tripiṭaka translator named it non-analytical cessation unconditioned. Third, empty space unconditioned. Among these three un-

conditioned, analytical cessation unconditioned is the principle of analytical cessation fearlessness where response-body tathāgatas, bodhisattvas, two vehicles, and ordinary beings sever delusions and realize principle—this is what the various schools clarify. Speaking of attaining the fruit of the three unconditioned perfectly, including non-analytical cessation unconditioned and empty space unconditioned, and explaining one's own realization—this is the dharma gate of this Benevolent Kings Sutra Contemplating Emptiness Chapter, and represents the difficult doctrine of the three unconditioned that the various schools deeply doubt. During Śākyamuni's responsive manifestation, Chan Master Zhiyi respectfully asked. The teaching-master Śākyamuni, one zhang six chi tall and crowned with golden light, proclaimed: "In the future, Tripiṭaka Master Xuanzang will appear in the world. He will easily propagate that analytical cessation unconditioned is the exhaustion of the nirvana unconditioned that severs view-delusions and cultivation-delusions, realizes principle, and extinguishes delusions. Non-analytical cessation unconditioned and empty space unconditioned—the principle of the Buddha's self-realization—will not be propagated even in the future. You should know that non-analytical cessation unconditioned prevents the afflictions of samsaric birth and death in the three realms and six paths from arising even when they wish to arise, making them never arise. It also closes the gates of the three evil paths forever, never allowing birth in evil paths, and even permanently separates from the ocean of suffering in the three realms' wheel, not allowing birth in the three realms. This is due to the power of non-analytical cessation unconditioned. The Buddha takes non-analytical cessation unconditioned as the perfect virtue of realization fruit. Next, empty space unconditioned is due to the exhaustion of emptiness in the Benevolent Kings Sutra Contemplating Emptiness Chapter—the exhaustion of the three unconditioned self-realized by all buddhas." Japan does not know the secret dharma of the three unconditioned.

The Matter of the Contemplating Emptiness Chapter's Three Realm-Stores Emptiness

The sutra states: "Seeing the three realms is the name of beings' karmic retribution. The six consciousnesses giving rise to immeasurable desires without end is called desire realm-store emptiness. The karmic fruits arising from delusion about form are called form realm-store emptiness. The karmic fruits arising from delusion about mind are called formless realm-store emptiness. The fundamental ignorance of three-realm emptiness is also empty." 《Marginal note: Above》 According to Śākyamuni's responsive proclamation, when expounding the Benevolent Kings Sutra in this way, one proclaims three realm-store emptiness. The three realms are the [dwelling of] beings

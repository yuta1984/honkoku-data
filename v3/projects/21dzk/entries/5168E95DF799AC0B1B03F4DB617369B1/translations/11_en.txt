When one lectures and reads the Benevolent Kings Sutra, the seven calamities of the country immediately cease and seven blessings immediately arise. Śākyamuni explained: "This Prajñā Sutra is the spiritual foundation of the mind-consciousness of all buddhas, bodhisattvas, and sentient beings. It is the father and mother of all countries. It is also called 'divine talisman,' also called 'demon-subduing spirit,' also called 'wish-fulfilling jewel,' also called 'country-protecting jewel,' also called 'heaven-earth mirror,' also called 'dragon treasure divine king.'" 《Marginal note: Above》 If so, the Benevolent Kings Prajñā has various names. First 《Marginal note: [Investigation] Characters may be missing after "first"》 Spiritual Foundation Dwelling 《Marginal note: [Investigation] "Dwelling" may be the character "Sutra"》, second is called Father-Mother Sutra, third is called Divine Talisman Sutra, fourth is called Demon-Subduing Sutra, fifth 《Marginal note: [Investigation] "name" may be missing after "fifth"》 Wish-Fulfilling Jewel Sutra, sixth is called Country-Protecting Jewel Sutra, seventh is called Heaven-Earth Mirror Earth 《Marginal note: [Investigation] "Earth" may be the character "Sutra"》, eighth is called Dragon Treasure Divine King Sutra. Explaining its meaning to you 《Marginal note: [Investigation] Among these five characters there may be missing characters, reconsider》." Śākyamuni's influence proclaimed: "The Benevolent Kings Prajñā is called the Spiritual Foundation Sutra because the minds of buddhas, bodhisattvas, and sentient beings are empty space, empty space is prajñā, and the spiritual foundation is prajñā. Therefore when sentient beings' minds are disturbed, countries are disturbed and seven calamities arise. When sentient beings' spirits are calm, countries are calm and seven calamities immediately become calm. Therefore the Prajñā Sutra is called the Spiritual Foundation Sutra. Next, the Benevolent Kings Prajñā is called the Father-Mother Sutra because for all sentient beings, prajñā becomes father and prajñā becomes mother to give birth, hence it is called Father-Mother Sutra. Next, the Benevolent Kings Prajñā is called Divine Talisman Sutra because all sentient beings' spirits protect prajñā. Next, the Benevolent Kings Prajñā is called Wish-Fulfilling Jewel Sutra because among the seven treasures of wheel-turning sacred kings, when the wish-fulfilling jewel treasure revolves, thunder-heaven does not sound, frost and snow do not fall, and seven calamities and nine misfortunes do not arise. This is what the awesome light of the wish-fulfilling treasure jewel brings about. When this Benevolent Kings Sutra wish-fulfilling treasure jewel revolves, within a thousand li seven calamities do not arise and it rains down seven blessings instead. The Benevolent Kings Sutra is called the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel Sutra Country-Protecting Jewel Sutra."

　　　Matters of Making Offerings to the Benevolent Kings Dharma Ritual
In the Chapter on Receiving and Upholding, the Buddha told the great king: "You should make nine-colored banners nine zhang long, also nine-colored flowers two zhang high, also thousand-branched lamps five zhang high, nine jade boxes, and nine jade cloths. Also place the Benevolent Kings Sutra on a seven-treasure altar. If so, within a thousand li, seven calamities will not arise and sins will not be born." 《Marginal note: Above》
　　　Matters of the Benevolent Kings Sutra Guardian Deities: Five Thousand Great Demon Kings and Five Great Power Honored Ones
The Benevolent Kings Sutra says: "For kings of various countries who make offerings to the Benevolent Kings Sutra, I will send five great power bodhisattvas to protect their countries. The five great powers are: first, Vajra Roar Bodhisattva, holding a thousand-treasure wheel in hand to protect the country; second, Dragon King Roar Bodhisattva, holding a golden wheel lamp in hand to protect the country; third, Fearless Ten Powers Roar Bodhisattva, holding a vajra pestle in hand to protect the country; fourth, Thunder Lightning Roar Bodhisattva, holding a thousand-treasure net in hand to protect the country; fifth, Immeasurable Power Roar Bodhisattva, holding five thousand sword wheels in hand to protect the country. These five great powers and five thousand great demon spirit kings protect countries that revere the Benevolent Kings Sutra." Śākyamuni's influence proclaimed: "The guardian deities of the Benevolent Kings Prajñā Sutra are the five great powers 《Marginal note: indeed》. The five great powers are the five thousand great demon spirit kings who protect countries where the Benevolent Kings Sutra is located. The five great are guardian deities of the Prajñā Sutra. The guardian deities of the Prajñā Sutra are called the five types of vajra spirits in my various Prajñā sutras. You should know they are the five great wisdom kings. The five great wisdom kings are: first, Trailokyavijaya wisdom king; second, Kuṇḍali wisdom king; third, Mahāteja wisdom king; fourth, Vajrayakṣa wisdom king; fifth, Great Saint Acala wisdom king. The mantras of the five great power wisdom kings protect the wisdom

kings. The ultimate of mantras is prajñā. Therefore I say: if esoteric mantra empowerment prayers do not succeed, go and read the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sutra seven times in reverse. 《Marginal note: And so on》 This is the ultimate of mantras—the letter A's original non-arising. The letter A's original non-arising is prajñā's original non-arising, the central platform Mahāvairocana self-nature wheel mind. The bodhisattva is called Prajñā Bodhisattva. The mantra of Prajñā Bodhisattva takes prajñā as its essence, and as the self-nature wheel is called Prajñā Bodhisattva. If so, since the Benevolent Kings Prajñā contains all sections of prajñā as the sea of sarvajñā, making offerings to the Benevolent Kings Prajñā is making offerings to all Prajñā sutras. Therefore the five great of esoteric mantras manifest as the five great powers to protect countries where the Benevolent Kings Prajñā is located. The eastern Trailokyavijaya wisdom king protects the east, so seven calamities do not come to the east. The southern Kuṇḍali wisdom king protects the south, so seven calamities do not come to the south. The western Mahāteja wisdom king protects the west, so seven calamities do not come to the west. The northern Vajrayakṣa wisdom king protects the north, so seven calamities do not come to the north. The central Acala wisdom king protects the center, so 《Marginal note: [Investigation] Two characters "seven calamities" may be missing after "center"》 none arise in the country. When this was explained, the sixteen great kings awakened to the characteristics of the first ground, the eighteen Brahmā heavens realized the true reality of no-arising, and ten thousand bodhisattvas realized wonderful awakening samādhi, worldly truth samādhi, and ultimate truth samādhi. This samādhi is the king of all samādhis. Also, ten faith bodhisattvas ascended to the vajra summit and achieved perfect enlightenment. 《Marginal note: And so on》
　　　Matters of the Benevolent Kings Sutra Three Truths Samādhi King of All Samādhis
Śākyamuni's influence decreed: "The three truths samādhi of the Benevolent Kings Prajñā is the king samādhi of all samādhis. The three truths samādhi are: first, worldly truth samādhi 《Marginal note: conventional truth》; second, ultimate truth samādhi 《Marginal note: emptiness truth》; third,

first principle truth samādhi 《Marginal note: middle truth》. Worldly truth samādhi is called conventional truth samādhi in our school's Necklace Sutra. Ultimate truth samādhi is called emptiness truth samādhi in our school's Necklace Sutra. First principle truth samādhi is called middle way samādhi in our school's Necklace Sutra. All samādhis do not go beyond the three truths samādhi. The three truths samādhi is the king samādhi of all samādhis. In worldly truth samādhi there are worlds. Where there are worlds, there are countries. Where there are countries, there are seven calamities. Where there are seven calamities, the contemplative prajñā of ultimate truth samādhi sweeps away the seven calamities. The true characteristic prajñā of middle way samādhi also sweeps away the seven calamities." 《Marginal note: Above》

　　Chapter on Entrustment and Accumulation

In explaining this chapter there are three meanings. First, regarding the reason for its placement: in the previous Chapter on Receiving and Upholding, one received the Benevolent Kings Sutra and upheld the Benevolent Kings Sutra. Now in the Chapter on Entrustment and Accumulation, through the power of faith one receives, through the power of mindfulness one upholds, entrusting to the sixteen great kings and others. It comes after the Chapter on Receiving and Upholding 《Marginal note: [Investigation] The three characters "Chapter on Entrustment and Accumulation" may be missing after "Chapter"》. Next, explaining the chapter name: because it entrusts to the sixteen kings repeatedly and accumulatively, it is called the Chapter on Entrustment and Accumulation. Third, entering the text for analysis and explanation: The Buddha told King Prasenajit: "Eighty years after my parinirvāṇa, eight hundred years later, eight thousand years later, there will be no Three Jewels and no one who believes in the Three Jewels. Therefore this sutra is also entrusted to kings. At that time this Benevolent Kings Sutra should be propagated throughout the country. You should know that when the Buddha-dharma perishes, kings and great ministers do not allow ordination and do not construct

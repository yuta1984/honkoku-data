Then who recited the Vinaya collection? Answer: According to the Shanjianlun (Commentary on Good Views), there were five people who successively recited the Vinaya collection. Question: Who were these five people? Answer: Upali, Dasheku, Sunaku, Xigafu, and Moggallana's son Tissu. These five people successively maintained the Vinaya in Jambudvipa (India) without interruption. Upali heard it from the Golden Mouth (Buddha), Dasheku heard it from Upali, Sunaku heard it from Dasheku, Xigafu heard it from Sunaku, and Moggallana's son heard it from Xigafu. After this, it was entrusted to Mahinda, who was the son of King Ashoka. Mahinda transmitted it to Arittha, Arittha transmitted it to Tissadatta, then to Kalasumana, then to Digana, then to Sumana, then to Kalasuna [Note: The Shanjian Vinaya has the character "mo" after "su"], then to Dharmagupta, then to Tissu, then to Deva, then to Sumana, then to Senaka, then to Dharmapali, then to Kima, then to Upatissu, then to Dharma-prabha, then to Abhaya, then to Deva, then to Siba. In total, twenty-four people. All these Vinaya masters were Arhats, transmitted from teacher to teacher, continuing unbroken to this day. Also, the Mahisasaka Vinaya states that Buddha taught Upali, Upali taught Sabara [Note: Sabara in the Mahisasaka Vinaya is written as Thasabara], Sabara taught Jutitasa, down to the final Venerable Daoli. That Vinaya records twenty-seven people in total. Such worthy people transmitted it successively without break. Question: How many years after Buddha's death did this teaching divide? Answer: According to the Mahavaipulya Sutra, over one hundred years after the extinction, the Vinaya teaching divided into five schools: first, the Dharmaguptaka school; second, the Sarvastivada school; third, the Mahisasaka school; fourth, the Kasyapiya school; fifth, the Vatsiputriya school. Also according to the Sariputra Question Sutra, Manjusri Question Sutra, Three Thousand Deportments Sutra, Last Teaching Sutra, Sectarian Wheels Treatise, etc., after Buddha's extinction

one hundred years later, the four assemblies deliberated together and, due to disagreements over Mahadeva's five points, split into two schools: first, the Mahasamghika school; second, the Sthaviravada school. The four assemblies were: first, the Dragon-Elephant Assembly (the assembly of Vinaya masters); second, the Border Assembly (Mahadeva's assembly); third, the Much-Learning Assembly (the assembly of Sutra masters); fourth, the Great Virtue Assembly (the assembly of Abhidharma masters). After this, in the second century, three schools emerged from the Mahasamghika: first, the Ekavyavaharika school; second, the Lokottaravada school; third, the Gokulika school. After this, in the second century, another school emerged from the Mahasamghika called the Bahusrutiya school. After this, in the second century, yet another school emerged called the Prajnaptivada school. At the end of the second century, three schools split off: first, the Caitika school; second, the Aparasaila school [Note: the character "bu" (school) may be missing after "zhu" (dwelling)]; third, the Uttarasaila school. Together with the original, there were nine schools. After this, in the third century [Note: the three characters "Sthaviravada school" may be missing here], it divided into two schools: first, the Sarvastivada school, also called the Hetuvada school; second, the original Sthaviravada school, also renamed the Haimavata school. After this, in the third century, one school emerged from the Sarvastivada, also called the Vatsiputriya school. After this, in the third century, four schools emerged from the Vatsiputriya: first, the Dharmottariya school; second, the Bhadrayaniya school; third, the Sammitiya school; fourth, the Sannagarika school. After this, in the third century, another school emerged from the Sarvastivada, also called the Mahisasaka school. After this, in the third century, one school emerged from the Mahisasaka called the Dharmaguptaka school. At the end of the third century, one school emerged from the Sarvastivada called the Kasyapiya school, also called the Suvarsaka school. At the beginning of the fourth century, another school emerged from the Sarvastivada called the Sautrantika school, also called the Samkrantika school. Together with the original, there were eleven schools. Question: Among these twenty schools, to which school does the Four-Part Vinaya belong? Answer: This Four-Part Vinaya belongs to the Dharmaguptaka

school. Question: Based on what text do you say this? Answer: Based on the Sariputra Question Sutra, Three Thousand Deportments Sutra, Last Teaching Sutra, and Sectarian Wheels Treatise - according to these four texts we say this.

Second, regarding "sages and ordinary people flowing to China": Question: Who first transmitted this Vinaya teaching to Chinese territory? Answer: The Shanjianlun states that it was entrusted to various great masters and transmitted to various countries. Also, Maharakshita once went to Chinese territory and spread the Vinaya teaching. Also, Sri Lanka and other places each had different people spreading it. Question: During which of the nine dynasties was it spread to Chinese territory? Answer: Emperor Ming of Later Han ascended the throne in the first year of Yongping (68 CE), year of Wuwu. By the fifth year of Yongping, he dreamed at night of a golden figure sixteen feet tall. In the tenth year, the year of Dingmao, there was a monk from the Western Regions, Kasyapa Matanga, who traveled and arrived in Chinese territory. Also in the eleventh year, year of Wuchen, Zhu Falan also came to this land. The people of this land requested saying, "We wish to know the master's dharma and receive ordination as monks." They immediately gave them tonsure, had them wear the uncut robe, and gave them the Three Refuges and Five Precepts. According to the Sarvastivada Treatise, eight years after Buddha's enlightenment, the Three Refuges were stopped and ordination ceremonies were established. In central regions ten people were required, in border regions five assemblies. Because of this, Matanga had only two people and could not receive full ordination. Thus it continued until the tenth emperor, Huan Di Zhi, who ascended the throne in the year Dinghai, and through twenty-one years until the year Dingwei of Yongkang first year. From Emperor Ming's year Wuchen to this Dingwei was one hundred years total, using only the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, mutually transmitting and receiving them. After Emperor Huan died, the eleventh Emperor Ling ascended. He took the throne in Wushen, and from the Jianning years onward, there were five monks from Northern India: Zhi Faling, Zhi Qian, Zhu Fahu, Zhu Daosheng, and Zhi Lou Chan [Note: The character "jia" may be missing before "chan"] - these five people came to this land and received ordination with fully ordained monks. This was ordination with five people. From then on,

there was first the mutual transmission of the precept dharma. At that time the complete Vinaya had not yet arrived in this land. Zhi Faling orally recited the Precept Text in one fascicle and the Ordination Manual in one fascicle, which circulated here. The ancient ordination manuals and precept texts of today all derive from the Dharmaguptaka school. After this, another fifty-five years passed until the third year of Huangchu under Wei Emperor Wen [Cao Cao's son], year of Renyin, when there was a monk from Central India named Dharmaraksha [sometimes called Krakucchanda], which translates as "Dharma-Time." He traveled to Xuchang [in the second year of Huangchu, Xu County was renamed Xuchang]. This person was intelligent from youth, with extraordinary appearance and character. Upon reading and reviewing once, he completely understood the meaning of texts. He was skilled in the four Vedas and excellent in the five sciences treatises. Regarding divination and cosmic changes, there was nothing he could not explain. He considered himself unequalled in the world. Then he entered a monastery and encountered the Dharmaśreṣṭhi Abhidharma. He earnestly studied it but could not understand its essential meaning. He deeply sighed, saying, "The Buddha-dharma is profound and subtle." He then became a monk and recited Mahayana and Hinayana sutras and various Vinayas. Coming to Xuchang, he observed that the Wei monastic community completely lacked standards of discipline. After his arrival, another twenty-eight years passed, combined with the previous fifty-five years making eighty-three years total, until the second year of Jiaping under the deposed Wei Emperor, King Fang of Qi, year of Gengwu. At Luoyang he again assembled Sanskrit monks and used the ordination ceremony to have the fully ordained monks receive ordination again. He employed ten monks as the standard and also translated the Mahisasaka Precept Text in one fascicle. Also, the monk Dharmisatya from Parthia, who was also skilled in Vinaya studies, produced the Dharmaguptaka Ordination Ceremony for use in ordination. The reason for this re-ordination is as recorded in Master Mai's "Illustrated Records of Sutra Interpretation." This was the origin of ordination for fully ordained monks. Next, clarifying regarding the nuns' community: After Emperor Ling, they also sought to receive full ordination from the fully ordained monks. Zhi Faling said, "According to the Buddha's teaching, only ordination by five fully ordained monks in border regions is permitted; it is not permitted for nuns." The nuns withdrew weeping. After Emperor Ling, fifty-three years passed...

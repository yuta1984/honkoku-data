Relics, sutra images, vinaya treatises, commentaries, personal robes and bowls, etc. were loaded onto the second ship. On the Renzi day, fifteenth day of the twelfth month, four ships departed together. Three of those ships all drifted about and were damaged, but only the second ship on which the great master rode, though encountering fierce winds, safely reached Satsuma Province. This too was due to the master's protection. After twelve days at sea, on the twenty-sixth day Xinmao they entered Dazaifu. On the fourth day of the second month of Tenpyo-shoho 6, year Jiawu, they entered the capital. The master was fifty-six years old. Imperial envoy Yasuyado-o received them with consolation outside Rajomon Gate and led them into Todai-ji Temple for lodging. On the fifth day, Tang Vinaya Master Doxuan, Abbbot Bodai, and various great masters and meditation teachers from temples came to offer mutual consolation. On the sixth day, over two hundred officials from ministers, senior counselors, prime ministers on down came together to pay respects and make inquiry. Afterward, imperial envoy Senior Fourth Rank Upper Kibi no Ason Makibi came to proclaim the imperial edict of consolation:

"Great Master of Japan, that you have traversed distant blue waves to come to this country truly fulfills Our intent, and Our joy and comfort cannot be expressed. We have been building this Todai-ji Temple for years, wanting to establish an ordination platform for conferring precepts on the monks' assembly. Since having this intention, We have not forgotten it day or night. Now that the master has come from afar to transmit the precept-dharma accords mysteriously with Our heart. From now on, conferring ordination and transmitting dharma shall be entirely entrusted to the master's propagation."

Immediately they invited the great master, monk Fashin, and accompanying disciples to enter the palace for lodging. The Retired Emperor first requested the great master and personally received the pure bodhisattva precepts face-to-face. Therefore they honored the master as Great Archbishop of the Buddhist Gate. That monk Fashin was made Vinaya Master. Therefore, immediately to relieve the master's travel fatigue, they permanently granted to the great master the four-block estate and buildings of Prince Niitabe's residence in Right Capital Fifth Avenue Second Ward of Nara, along with one hundred cho of rice fields in Bizen Province, to serve as lodging quarters and provisions. They then decorated and built temple halls, calling them Shotai. They installed Buddhist images and sutra teachings, held unrestricted offerings to provide for monks of the ten directions, employing this for future ordination platforms. They decorated and built the two temples of Todai-ji and Shotai, conferring ordination without interruption. In the middle of Hoji 2, there was another separate imperial edict adding to the master's title, proclaiming to all monks and nuns throughout the realm to take refuge with the great master and study the precept-dharma.

From then on, using the 250 precepts for monks and 500 precepts for nuns, they conferred these on the class of renunciants in this land, maintaining Buddhism and protecting the nation. However, afterward, those ordination ceremonies up to the present time, though several years have passed, still form one path without any differences. Gradually reflecting, the master's maintenance should accord with Buddha's intent. Entering the great from the small, in both Great Tang and Japan, the transmitted dharma is singular with no separate branches. Who could compete with this? The traces of his maintenance extend to future generations; his compassionate guidance reaches even plants and trees. Who has only present benefits but also encompasses future benefits? Thus, the sages of past and future used Buddhist precepts to spread throughout Jambudvipa. Though the seven groups of followers each receive and maintain them, they have not yet manifested the honored titles of teachers and disciples, nor clarified the transmitted realms. Therefore I briefly record this. The transmission of precept-dharma is roughly as such.

This one volume of the Record of the Transmission of Precepts and Vinaya was transmitted by me. Now it is being donated to the treasury of Toshodai-ji Temple.

This book was compiled by Great Master Hoan, dharma-grandson of our sect's founder the overseas-crossing great master, in the seventh year of Tencho by imperial command. Reflecting that it has been transmitted to the present after a thousand years, it is truly the most ancient treasured book and must be cherished with reverence. However, the original was three volumes, and presently only this upper volume exists. This is deeply regrettable. Here I have added interlinear red punctuation using a similar text from Hoan 5, but have not achieved precise collation. Later scholars should know this and make corrections.

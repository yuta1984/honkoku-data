Those who rigidly adhere to a single passage from sutras and treatises to establish their sectarian doctrine are greatly mistaken. First, the five divisions and eight divisions are encompassed in this matter. The five divisions are like the present sutra. The eight divisions are: Mahāprajñāpāramitā, Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā, Guangzan, Fangguang, Mañjuśrī's Questions Sutra, Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā, Daoxing, and Four Heavenly Kings' Questions on Prajñā. The present sutra is encompassed within the Heavenly Kings' Questions. 

Pāramitā: Reaching the other shore. Pāra means "other shore" and mitā means "to reach." The commentary states: "Abandoning characteristics and meeting reality is called reaching the other shore." Also, "causes achieving fruition is called reaching the other shore."

Sūtra: Called sūtra (xiūduōluō). This is translated as "dharma source." Principle does not manifest by itself but relies on teaching to be revealed. Teaching serves as the source of principle. The Hinayāna treatises give five meanings: 1) Production - because it produces various meanings, 2) Spring meaning - because its flavor is inexhaustible, 3) Manifestation - because it manifests various meanings, 4) Plumb line - because it removes error and obtains correctness, 5) Garland - because it threads through various meanings. In common usage it means "source." Sūtra means "warp thread." Text serves as warp and meaning as weft, weaving the practitioner's mind, hence called sūtra.

Introductory Chapter One: The cause of arising is called introduction (序). Related meanings following together are called chapter (品). Being first among eight is called "number one." Second, sutra essence: Takes the Five Endurances and Ten Stages as essence. The text below states "The Five Endurances are the bodhisattva dharma." Third, sutra doctrine: Takes non-arising correct contemplation as doctrine. The text below states "Prajñā is without knowledge, without seeing, without practice, without reception, without birth, without cessation, etc." Fourth, sutra function: Takes inner and outer protection as function. Inner protection: the text below states "For bodhisattvas, explain protection of Buddha-fruit." Outer protection: the text below states "Now I explain protection of the state for you." Fifth, teaching characteristics: Takes partial

and perfect as characteristics. Consider the teaching style of one lifetime. First, the matter of eight chapters in three sections. The introductory chapter is the introductory section. The six chapters from "Contemplating Emptiness" onward constitute the main doctrine. The one chapter on entrustment is the circulation section. Within the introductory section there are two major parts: namely, the attestation sequence and the inspiration sequence. Also general sequence and specific sequence, Tathāgata sequence and Ānanda sequence, pre-sutra sequence and post-sutra sequence, etc., multiple layers - consider this. First, the matter of five accomplishments: as usual. Also, the Vajra Immortal Treatise makes six-sentence distinctions. "Thus" expresses the mark of faith. "I heard" clarifies that Ānanda received the intention, testified and recorded without creating. "One time" is the time period of hearing the sutra. "Buddha" is the teaching master. "Dwelling" is the dwelling place. "With great bhikṣus" are the co-hearing assembly. This is the gist.

Thus: Why is "thus" placed at the beginning of all sutras? The Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra Volume 2 states: "When the Buddha was about to enter nirvāṇa, Ānanda's mind was submerged in an ocean of sorrow. Aniruddha was his cousin and said: 'You are a person who transmits the dharma treasury and should not be the same as ordinary people. If you have doubts, you should ask in time.' Ānanda still embraced grief and sorrow. Aniruddha taught him to ask four questions: After the Buddha's nirvāṇa, how should we practice the Way? Who should be our teacher? How should we live together with the foul-mouthed Chanda? What words should be placed at the beginning of Buddha's sutras? When Ānanda raised these questions, the Buddha answered the first: 'Depend on pure dharmas and cultivate the four foundations of mindfulness.' He answered the second: 'The liberation precept sutra is the great teacher.' He answered the third: 'Chanda should be disciplined with brahma-dharma.' He answered the fourth: 'I gathered the dharma treasury for three immeasurable kalpas - initially place words like "thus" at the beginning. All Buddhas of the three times speak thus.' 'Thus' is an expression of faithful acceptance. Faith is the means of entering the great ocean of Buddha-dharma.

I heard: When the Buddha instructed Ānanda to produce the dharma treasury, he should say "I heard this from the Buddha's side." This is to prevent people from not trusting Ānanda and abandoning the Way because of the person. It also says: There is no duality between self and no-self. We speak of "self" only for conventional purposes. Ānanda was born at midnight when the Buddha attained enlightenment. He began serving the Buddha at age twenty-five. The Buddha had taught extensively since his enlightenment. Though that person was not present at those sessions, why does he claim "I heard" for everything? The answer is given in detail in Volume 6 of the Repaying Kindness Sutra. Ānanda requested various wishes for sutras he had not heard, asking the Buddha to teach them again. Therefore, all were personally received. Śāstra Volume 2 records that Ānanda himself spoke a verse: "When the Buddha first taught the dharma, at that time I did not see. Thus I heard through transmission. When the Buddha was in Vārāṇasī, for the five bhikṣus he first opened the ambrosia gate and taught the Four Noble Truths." This repeated teaching is called "hearing through transmission." The Bodhisattva from the Womb Sutra states: "When the Buddha was in the twin śāla trees and had already entered the golden coffin, he arose and extended his golden hand, asking Ānanda: 'From before until now, I have taught the Mahāyāna vaipulya sutras for bodhisattvas - do you know them all?' He replied: 'Only the Buddha knows.' Again: 'Similarly, I once ascended to Trāyastriṃśa Heaven to teach dharma for my mother - do you know?' He answered: 'I do not know.' Again he asked: 'When I was in the dragon palace teaching dharma for dragons - do you know?' He answered: 'I do not know.' Again he asked: 'When I was in the womb turning the wonderful dharma wheel - do you know?' He answered: 'I do not know.' After such questioning, the Buddha told Ānanda: 'Now listen carefully. I shall explain each one for you.' The Tathāgata's oral secrets were transmitted all at once. Ānanda obtained the Buddha-awakening samādhi and received them all at once. Obtaining the Buddha-awakening samādhi appears in Śāriputra's Questions Sutra.

One time: The time of teaching the sutra. Like teaching nirvāṇa on February 15th. This sutra takes

【Left page, lower section】
January 8th of the 30th year as its time.

Buddha: Abbreviated Sanskrit. The name of a perfectly awakened one. In full, it is "buddha" - consider this.

Dwelling: There are many types of dwelling. Three types: heavenly dwelling, brahma dwelling, noble dwelling. Heavenly dwelling refers to the six desire heavens. Brahma dwelling refers to the first dhyāna and above. Noble dwelling refers to the three vehicles - consider this. Also eight dwellings: 1) Heavenly dwelling - dwelling in the four dhyānas, 2) Brahma dwelling - dwelling in the four immeasurable minds, 3) Deportment dwelling - dwelling in the four deportments, 4) Noble dwelling - dwelling in the three emptinesses, 5) Lifespan dwelling - dwelling in the five-part dharma body, 6) Dependent dwelling - dwelling in places like Rājagṛha, 7) Teaching dwelling - dwelling in the sixteen great countries, 8) Buddha dwelling - dwelling in ultimate truth. What is called dwelling: temporary presence is called "being," long residence is called "dwelling." Also, temporary stopping can be called "dwelling."

Rājagṛha: In foreign countries called Mahārājagṛha. Mahā means "great." Rāja here means "royal residence." Gṛha here means "city." Magadha country has twelve cities. Magadha is named "place that holds ambrosia." The twelve cities are: 1) Kuśinagara great city, 2) Pūrṇavardhana great city, 3) Ākṣayamati great city, 4) Buddhagaya great city, 5) Rājagṛha great city, 6) Śrāvastī great city, 7) Vārāṇasī great city, 8) Kapilavastu great city, 9) Campā city, 10) Vaiśālī city, 11) Kauśāmbī city, 12) Kuru city. The Buddha dwelled briefly in the latter six cities. Among the former six, the Buddha was not present in the first four. He mostly dwelled in the latter two, and among these dwelled most often in Rājagṛha. The king of Magadha had a son born with one head having two faces and four arms. People of the time saw this as inauspicious. The king then tore apart the body and head and abandoned them in the wilderness. There was a rākṣasī woman, a demon named Lirā, who returned

distinctions. These three being already different, it is not yet known whether the dharma gates of transformation are one, two, or immeasurable.

"Great King, the contemplation gates of all dharmas are neither one nor two, extending to immeasurable." The commentary says: From "Great King, contemplation gates of all dharmas" below, in the Buddha's second answer there are three parts. The first correctly answers dharma gate non-duality. From "Great King, the seven Buddhas taught" below, the second praises the teaching and encourages cultivation, clarifying the merits of the sutra. From "Great King, this sutra" below, the third establishes the sutra's name and encourages acceptance and maintenance. In the first part of correctly answering dharma gate non-duality, there are four sections. First, correctly answering the previous question, clarifying dharma gate non-duality. From "If bodhisattvas" below, raising what is not to reveal what is, thereby explaining the previous question. From "Great King, if there is, if there is not" below.

"Great King, if there is, if there is not - this is precisely conventional truth. Using the three truths to embrace all dharmas - emptiness truth, form truth, mind truth - therefore I say all dharmas do not transcend the three truths." The commentary says: From "Great King" below, in clarifying the emptiness of all truths, there are three parts. First clarifying conventional truth, next clarifying how the three truths embrace dharmas, third clarifying how conventional truth ultimately returns to emptiness. The first, conventional truth, in the text says "if there is, if there is not" - this means that ordinary beings cling definitively to existence and non-existence, hence it is called conventional truth. Next, clarifying how the three truths embrace dharmas. The text saying "all dharmas emptiness truth" - the Tripiṭaka master says: the original nature of all dharmas is emptiness truth. Ordinary beings [perceive] form as coarse and manifest, taking form as the standard, called form truth. Three-vehicle practitioners cultivating the path with undefiled mind is called mind truth. The layered meanings of the three truths should be contemplated.

"I-person-views-knowledge, emptiness of the five aggregates of grasping, extending to emptiness of all dharmas." The commentary says: From "I-person-views-knowledge" below, the third section clarifies how conventional truth returns to emptiness.

"Sentient beings of various categories, their faculties and practices being different, therefore [dharma gates are] neither one nor two." The commentary says: "Sentient beings of various categories"

below is the fourth section, generally responding to the above question. "Sentient beings of various categories" responds to the previous "immeasurable categories of sentient beings." "Faculties" responds to the above "faculties also immeasurable." "Practices" responds to the above "practices also immeasurable." "Dharma gates neither one nor two" responds to the above [question about] whether transforming dharma gates are one, two, or immeasurable.

"Great King, the seven Buddhas taught mahāprajñāpāramitā; what I now teach as prajñāpāramitā has no duality, no difference." The commentary says: From "Great King, seven Buddhas" below, in the answer's major second section, praising teaching and encouraging cultivation, clarifying sutra merits. The text has six distinctions. First clarifying that all Buddhas share the same path. From "You assembly" below, the second encourages maintenance. From "There are immeasurable" below, the third separately lists three rounds of Buddhas. From "These above three Buddhas" below, the fourth generally summarizes the above three Buddhas, clarifying the quantity of divisions in teaching prajñā. From "How much more" below, the fifth makes comparison. From "At that time, the assembly" below, the sixth [describes] hearing dharma benefits. The first, all Buddhas sharing the same path, in the text "What the seven Buddhas taught and what I now teach as prajñā have no duality, no difference" - generally taking Śākyamuni as [one of] the seven Buddhas, clarifying that his teaching is the same as the six Buddhas, revealing the authenticity of the dharma. Similarly having no attainment, hence no duality, no difference.

"You great assembly, the merits of accepting, maintaining, reading, reciting, understanding and explaining this sutra." The commentary says: The second section encouraging maintenance, in the text saying "You great assembly accept and maintain" - the Great Wisdom Treatise explains accepting and maintaining, saying: hearing and practicing is called accepting; maintaining for a long time without loss is called maintaining. Hence called accepting and maintaining. Reading, reciting, understanding meaning can be understood.

"There are immeasurable, ineffable, ineffable Buddhas; each Buddha teaches and transforms immeasurable, ineffable sentient beings; each sentient being attains buddhahood; these Buddhas again teach and transform immeasurable, ineffable sentient beings, all attaining buddhahood." The commentary says: The third section raises three rounds of Buddhas transforming sentient beings. From "immeasurable ineffable

Buddhas" is the first; the second from "each Buddha teaches and transforms." The third clarifies how the three-truth teaching gates embrace all dharmas, all returning to emptiness. From "sentient beings of various categories" below, the fourth concludes by responding to the previous question. In the first section correctly answering the question, the text from "Great King, contemplation gates of all dharmas" below answers the previous three phrases. "Neither one" answers the first question. "Neither two" answers the previous second question. "Extending to immeasurable" answers the third question. It should say "not immeasurable," but saying "extending to immeasurable" intends to reveal "the immeasurable of not-immeasurable." Since the meanings of one and two are already negated, immeasurable is likewise. Using alternating text to manifest meaning.

"All dharmas are also neither having characteristics nor not non-without characteristics." The commentary says: From "All dharmas are also neither having characteristics" below, repeatedly raising the transcendence of four phrases to explain the previous "contemplation gates of all dharmas." The sutra compiler preserves brevity, directly indicating the breaking of the two phrases of existence and non-existence. Other phrases can be understood. "Also neither having characteristics" breaks having characteristics. "Not non-without characteristics" is precisely the fourth phrase. Breaking "not without characteristics," hence saying "not non-without characteristics."

"If bodhisattvas see sentient beings, see one, see two, then do not see one, do not see two - one-two is ultimate truth." The commentary says: From "If bodhisattvas" below, raising what is not to reveal what is. First raising what is not, in the text "If bodhisattvas see sentient beings" means clinging to self and person. "Seeing one, seeing two" is the same as the Sāṅkhya and Vaiśeṣika views of unity and difference. Next clarifying the revelation of what is. The text says "One-two is ultimate truth." Knowing that the one-two of correct causation is ultimately pure, without dependence, without attainment. Knowing the quiescence of these one-two characteristics, hence saying "ultimate truth." From "Immeasurable sentient beings all attain buddhahood" onward constitutes the second round of Buddhas. From "These Buddhas again transform immeasurable sentient beings to achieve buddhahood" below is the third round of Buddhas.

"These above three Buddhas teach the prajñāpāramitā sutra - eight hundred million verses; within each verse, further dividing into a thousand parts; within each part, explaining the meaning of one part's phrases, inexhaustible." The commentary says: The fourth section, from "These above three Buddhas" below, generally summarizes the above three kinds of multiple Buddhas. Each Buddha speaks eight hundred million verses each, revealing that what is taught is already vast. In the divisions of teaching, less and more, there are three phrases. First dividing the sutra into eight hundred million verses. Second, within one verse, dividing into a thousand parts. Third, within one part, explaining the meaning of one part's phrases, inexhaustible.

"How much more so for those who generate one moment of faith in this sutra - these sentient beings transcend the merits of a hundred kalpas, a thousand kalpas, ten stages, etc. How much more so for those who accept, maintain, read, recite, understand and explain - their merits are equal to the Buddhas of the ten directions without difference. You should know this person is precisely the Tathāgata, not long from attaining buddhahood." The commentary says: From "How much more" below compares and measures faith. The text saying "one moment of faith transcends the ten stages" means one moment of faith in no-attainment prajñā surpasses the merits of practicing the ten stages with attainment for hundreds of thousands of kalpas. The text saying "equal to all Buddhas without difference; you should know such a person is precisely the Tathāgata, not long from attaining buddhahood" - Buddha is neither future nor present. Breaking future, hence saying "precisely the Tathāgata." Breaking present, hence saying "not long from attaining buddhahood." How could one cling to future and present equality as grounds for disputation?

"At that time, the great assembly heard this sutra being explained; ten billion people attained the three emptiness patience, one hundred million people attained great emptiness patience of the ten-stage nature." The commentary says: The sixth section, from "At that time, the great assembly" below, [describes] benefits gained from hearing the dharma. The text saying "ten billion people attained three emptiness patience" refers to emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. Saying "great emptiness patience" means within the ten stages, original wisdom speaking of suchness is called great emptiness patience. Also called no-attainment emptiness, hence called great emptiness patience.

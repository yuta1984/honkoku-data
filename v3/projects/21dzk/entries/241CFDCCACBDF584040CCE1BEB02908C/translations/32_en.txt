Neither certifying, nor sinking, nor emerging, nor inverting—this is skillful means contemplation. Just as water and waves are neither one nor different, so too all practices, pāramitās, concentrations, and dhāraṇīs are neither one nor two, yet each practice is accomplished. The commentary says: This clarifies the accomplishment of two wisdoms. The text saying "this initial awakening wisdom regarding existence and non-existence characteristics yet not being two" refers to true wisdom. From "skillful application" below clarifies expedient wisdom. The metaphor text saying "like water and waves being neither one nor different" clarifies that while sharing the same wetness quality, the practice aspect differs from the principle aspect. Saying "not different" clarifies that the wave's substance is precisely water's substance, just as practice substance is precisely principle substance. In the combined metaphor, the text saying "up to all practices not being one" clarifies that practice characteristics differ from principle. Consider this.

Through practicing for four incalculable kalpas, one enters this merit treasury gate. Having no karmic habitual births in the three realms, completing past [karma] without creating new [karma], through vow-power transforming and being born in all pure lands, constantly cultivating abandonment contemplation, therefore ascending to the kumāraka position, constantly bestowing the four great treasuries upon people. The commentary says: The eighth, advancing in practice, has four sub-phrases: First, clarifying long practice therefore entering this gate. The text saying "attaining entry through four incalculable [kalpas]" means surpassing the previous three patients, therefore called four incalculable. Second, no karmic retribution births in the three realms, the text says "completing past without creating new." No longer receiving three-existence fruition retribution, therefore saying "not creating new." Third, receiving birth through vow-power. Making the pre-ground thirty minds' uncontaminated [wisdom] as cause and ignorance as condition, attracting transformation birth beyond the three realms in the first ground. Fourth, constantly cultivating abandonment contemplation, abandoning all afflictions to be severed. Ninth, concluding the position. Kumāraka is called "child ground" in this land. Through being born in the Buddha family, also called "ground of separation from desire." Also called "ground of conquering evil māras." The first ground separates from the five fears.

Surpassing the māras of the two vehicles. Tenth, constantly using the four great treasuries to benefit beings. The four great treasuries are sūtra, vinaya, abhidharma, and miscellaneous treasury. One can also rely on the Śrīmālā Sūtra: First called human-divine good root treasury, second the śrāvaka treasury, third the pratyekabuddha treasury, fourth the Mahāyāna treasury.

Furthermore, Virtue-Wisdom Bodhisattva, using the four immeasurable minds, extinguishes the hatred and other afflictions of the three existences, dwelling in middle patience and practicing all merits. Therefore, using five incalculable kalpas to practice great compassion contemplation mind, with mind constantly manifest before, entering the signless jātipāla position to transform all sentient beings. The commentary says: From Virtue-Wisdom below is the second ground. The text has five divisions: first establishing the name, second wisdom and severance, third dwelling in middle patience for self-practice, fourth cultivation time period, fifth conclusion. First, establishing the name, the text says "Virtue-Wisdom Bodhisattva." Furthermore, Arcismatī Sacred Awakening Bodhisattva cultivates compliant dharma patience, opposing the five view streams, gathering immeasurable merits, dwelling in the srota-āpanna position. Constantly using divine eye, divine ear, past-life [knowledge], other-mind [knowledge], and bodily penetration, in each moment-thought being able to extinguish all views of the three realms. Therefore, also using seven incalculable kalpas to practice the five supernatural powers and Ganges-sand pāramitās, constantly not departing from mind. The commentary says: From Arcismatī ground below clarifies the fourth ground. The text has four parts. Establishing the name, the text says "Arcismatī Sacred Awakening Bodhisattva." Arcismatī is called "wisdom mother." Having already advanced in severing contemplation, therefore called "awakening penetration." Objects can generate wisdom; taking objects as wisdom mother. Second, establishing the patience name. Cultivating compliant dharma patience refers to the lower grade of compliant patience. Third, separation from obstacles, the text has three sub-phrases: first opposing view streams, second dwelling in initial fruition, third concluding separation from obstacles. First, opposing view streams clarifies that fourth-ground bodhisattvas can extinguish the habitual tendencies of the five view afflictions. The Tripiṭaka Master says: Mahāyāna separately has five views: first, birth-cessation view.

Following Hīnayāna extreme views. Second, four foundations of mindfulness view—damaging right mindfulness, following right mindfulness as antidote, following Hīnayāna wrong views. Third, good-evil view—damaging right effort. Right effort can practice all non-discrimination; if bodhisattva wholesome dharmas discriminate, they cannot be diligent. Following Hīnayāna precept-grasping views. Fourth, sentient being view—this is bodhisattva antidote. Bodhisattvas do not see sentient beings as different from bodhisattvas. Dwelling in srota-āpanna position has two meanings: First, regarding the cultivation path position, second and third grounds cultivate contaminated paths, suppressing afflictions through aversion. The fourth ground cultivates the uncontaminated, permanently severing afflictions, initially attaining cultivation of the uncontaminated. The second wisdom-severance, the text's "four immeasurable minds" clarifies wisdom. Extinguishing three-existence afflictions is precisely severance. Third, dwelling in middle patience practicing all merits praises self-benefit practice characteristics. Fourth, clarifying cultivation time period, the text's "five incalculable" fears being attached to the previous four, making it five. Fifth, concluding by saying "entering signless jātipāla." This translates as "crossing dark obscurity." Also called "fearless ground." The Tripiṭaka Master translates it as "fulfillment."

Furthermore, Clear Wisdom practitioner constantly using signless patience practices three-illumination contemplation, knowing that past, present, future dharmas have no coming, no going, no dwelling place. Mind and mental factors extinct, exhausting three-realm ignorance afflictions, attaining three-illumination all-merit contemplation. Therefore constantly using six incalculable kalpas to gather immeasurable illumination pāramitās, therefore entering the kāraka position, through signless practice upholding all dharmas. The commentary says: From Clear Wisdom below is the third ground, the text has five divisions: first establishing the name, second patience name, third wisdom-severance, fourth advancing practice time period, fifth concluding position. First, establishing the name, the text says "Clear Wisdom practitioner." Second, establishing the patience name, the text saying "practicing within signless patience" clarifies the superior grade of faith patience. Saying "three illuminations" means illuminating the no-birth of the three times, therefore saying

"no coming-going characteristics and also no dwelling place." The three times are ungraspable; contemplation is exhausted in conditions. Mind and mental factors extinct means conditions are exhausted in contemplation. Third, wisdom-severance, the text says "exhausting three-realm ignorance afflictions." Fourth, advancing practice time period is six incalculable. Adding to the previous five makes six. Fifth, concluding position, the text saying "entering kāraka position" means "crossing border lands."

Called srota-āpanna. The second meaning: Third ground and below create contaminated karma. First ground practices giving, second ground maintains precepts, third ground cultivates the eight concentrations of contaminated meditation. Fourth ground and above cultivate the uncontaminated, severing the three realms, opposing the stream of birth and death, called srota-āpanna. Also, this person severs the causes of person-characteristic self-obstruction, resembling Hīnayāna first fruition; the name is established based on similarity. The five powers of divine eye etc.: Third-ground bodhisattvas, while in contaminated positions, cultivate the path and attain five powers. Fourth ground, while in the uncontaminated, attains five powers. Partially attaining exhaustion of contaminations, but not clearly manifested due to brevity. Third, concluding separation from obstacles says "extinguishing all views of the three realms." Fourth, advancing practice time, the text says "using seven incalculable."

Furthermore, Excellent Penetration Bodhisattva, in compliant path patience, using the four fearlessnesses to contemplate nayuta truths, inner path treatises, outer path treatises, medicine prescriptions, crafts, and incantations. Therefore "I am a person of all-knowledge," extinguishing three-realm doubt and other afflictions, therefore "my characteristics are already exhausted." Knowing each ground has something that emerges, therefore called "emerging path"; having something that does not emerge, therefore called "manifest path." Opposing three-realm doubts, cultivating and gathering immeasurable merits, therefore immediately entering sakṛdāgāmin position. Again practicing within eight incalculable kalpas, practicing various dhāraṇī gates, therefore constantly practicing fearless contemplation without departing from mind. The commentary says: From Excellent Penetration below clarifies the fifth ground. Text has five sections: first establishing the name, second explaining patience.

Up to here. The meaning is as follows: "Non-non-dharma" means neither existence nor non-existence. If dharma is existent, it can be known as existent. If dharma is non-existent, it can be illuminated as non-existent. Since dharma is neither existent nor non-existent, the sage's way of illuminating is like empty space in all things. The present "seeing" is actually seeing without seeing. It is not seeing with fixed nature. "If dharma is non-non-dharma" points to the dharma-essence being empty and quiescent. "This is called non-non-dharma emptiness" correctly clarifies that the observer and observed are empty. "Immediate arising" means arising through gathering together. "Immediate dwelling" means the conditioned temporarily passing through and stopping, called dwelling. "Immediate extinction" means not arising and immediately extinguishing. "Immediate existence, immediate emptiness" means existence through gathering together, and immediate emptiness because the self-essence is empty. Above, dharmas like form are discussed. From "moment to moment" below, mind is discussed, following the above pattern.

Why? Ninety moments make one thought; in one thought, one moment experiences nine hundred births and extinctions; up to form and all dharmas are also thus—"Why?" below explains the reason for the above emptiness of form and mind. Taking ninety moments as one thought, and all things likewise—above, form was extensively discussed and mind briefly discussed. Now, regarding the internal, mind is extensively clarified and form-emptiness is briefly explained. The text is skillfully crafted—consider this.

Form-dharmas develop from subtle-minute to coarse-flavor 《Split writing: [note] flavor/store, commentary writes "minute"》, from four minutiae to four great elements, from four great elements to the sense faculties. Mind-dharmas: ninety moments make one thought. One moment has nine hundred births and extinctions. Ninety moments have eighty-one thousand births and extinctions. Using birth-extinction to break down moments, using moments to break down one thought. Thus mind-dharmas cannot be obtained. This is the reason for clarifying mind-emptiness. Using the four great elements to divide the sense faculties, but the sense faculties cannot be obtained. Using the four dusts to divide the four great elements, but the four great elements cannot be obtained. Using coarse-minute to divide the four minutiae, but the four minutiae cannot be obtained. Using subtle-flavor 《Split writing: [note] flavor/store, commentary writes "minute"》 to divide coarse-minute, but coarse-minute cannot be obtained. Breaking down form

to the ultimate minute. Exhausting mind to complete birth-extinction. When form is exhausted and mind is completed, there is suddenly nowhere to dwell. This is the meaning of protecting Buddha-results.

Through the emptiness of prajñāpāramitā, not seeing conditions, not seeing truths, up to all dharmas being empty—Above, dharmas were raised to clarify wisdom-emptiness. Now wisdom is raised to clarify dharma-emptiness. "Not seeing conditions"—one meaning is mind-emptiness; one meaning is the twelve links. "Not seeing truths"—one meaning is realm-emptiness; one meaning is the four truths.

Internal emptiness 《Split writing: six sense faculties》 external emptiness 《Split writing: six sense objects》 internal-external emptiness 《Split writing: sense faculties and objects observed together》 conditioned emptiness 《Split writing: dependent form-mind》 unconditioned emptiness 《Split writing: empty space》 beginningless emptiness 《Split writing: distinguishing from non-Buddhists' "having beginning"》 nature emptiness 《Split writing: all dharmas originally non-existent》 ultimate meaning emptiness 《Split writing: true characteristics of all dharmas》 prajñāpāramitā emptiness 《Split writing: Great Vehicle emptiness》 cause emptiness 《Split writing: from Vajra stage downward, all completely empty and quiescent》 Buddha-result emptiness. Even emptiness is empty 《Split writing: also》 therefore empty—Commentary states: What difference is there between emptiness and emptiness-of-emptiness? Answer: Emptiness destroys the five aggregates; emptiness-of-emptiness destroys emptiness. Like taking medicine to destroy illness—after the illness is destroyed, the medicine should also exit. If the medicine doesn't exit, it immediately becomes illness again. Using emptiness to extinguish all afflictions, but fearing emptiness might again become a problem. Therefore using emptiness to abandon emptiness. Hence called "emptiness-of-emptiness."

But through dharma-gathering, there is existence—Second, answering according to manifest function. Above, emptiness was discussed with the same entry into reality. Now discussing existence makes it constituted by the three provisionals. The meaning of three provisionals is as above. Using subtle form to create multiple forms is called "existence through dharma-gathering." 《Split writing: text》

Existence through reception-gathering—Reception-gathering is reception-provisional. The four great elements like earth gathering together subtle four dusts to form what is called reception-gathering.

Existence through name-gathering—What is called "name-gathering" is name-provisional. Names, phrases, etc., gathering together sound-dust to form, therefore

called "existence through name-gathering."

Existence through cause-gathering—Afflictions, karma, etc., gathering and arising from conditions is called "existence through cause-gathering."

Existence through result-gathering—Retribution like the five aggregates arising from bound karma is called "existence through result-gathering."

Existence through ten practices—From ten faiths to ten grounds. Because they gather and arise from conditions, they are generally called "existence through ten practices."

Existence through Buddha-results—Bodhi and nirvana obtained from causal practices is called "existence through Buddha-results."

Up to all existence in the six realms 《Split writing: as in the text》.

Good son, if a bodhisattva sees dharmas, sentient beings, self, person, knowledge, and views, this person practices in the world no different from the world—Third, raising loss to reveal gain. First raising loss: If one grasps self-notions not yet forgotten, and the mind attached to dharmas becomes increasingly agitated and heavy 《Split writing: [note] below "heavy," the Tripitaka commentary has the character "one"》, this person is the same as worldly sentiment. Therefore not different from the world.

Regarding all dharmas, not moving, not reaching, not extinguishing, without characteristics, without non-characteristics, all dharmas are also thus—From "regarding all dharmas" below reveals gain. "Not reaching"—the Perfection of Wisdom Treatise states: The dharma of equality cannot be reached by any sage. Subhūti addressed the Buddha saying that other sages cannot reach it, but why doesn't the Buddha reach it? The Buddha said that even the Buddha cannot reach it. Why? Because Buddha is equality itself; equality is Buddha. Because Buddha and equality are not two, it's called "not reaching." "Not extinguishing"—in the commentary, dharmas are originally not thus, so now there is no extinction. 《Split writing: text》 "Without characteristics, etc."—in the commentary, all buddhas are all one characteristic, namely no

characteristics. 《Split writing: text》

All buddhas, dharma, sangha are also thus 《Split writing: explained according to above》—this is the first ground, one thought-moment completely possessing eighty-four thousand prajñāpāramitā—This has distinctions within the unconditioned dharma. One thought-moment of no-attainment completely possesses everything. Now saying "eighty-four thousand" is merely one approach of dharma-gates. First ground bodhisattvas take true suchness as mind. How could there be one thought-moment? 《Split writing: [note] "how" in Tripitaka, commentary writes "also"》 Because borrowing one thought-moment of lower grounds to compare the accumulated virtue of upper grounds, it says "one thought-moment." Eighty-four thousand—the Bhadrakalpika Sutra states: It distinguishes three hundred fifty perfections. Beginning from the perfection of cultivation and the perfection of radiance, ending at the perfection of distributing relics—these are the three hundred fifty perfections. Within each perfection there are six perfections. Combined: two thousand one hundred perfections. Within each perfection there are again the ten good deeds. Combined: twenty-one thousand perfections. Dividing by the four good roots gives eighty-four thousand pāramitās. This also corresponds to the eighty-four thousand gates of various defilements.

Immediately carrying is called Mahāyāna—《Split writing: [note] Above "according to," there should probably be the two characters "commentary states"》 Based on illuminating function, it's called prajñā. Discussing its conveyance, it's named "vehicle." Because it can convey people toward Buddhahood, it's called "carrying is called Mahāyāna." 《Split writing: text》

Immediately extinguishing becomes vajra—Being able to destroy afflictions is called "immediately extinguishing becomes vajra."

Also called concentration—Because it separates from distraction, it's called "concentration." 《Split writing: text》

Also called all practices—Being able to benefit self and others, with no virtue not encompassed, it's called "all practices."

Great King, bodhisattvas cultivate and protect Buddha-result for this reason—Generally concluding and answering the meaning of protecting result above.

Protecting prajñāpāramitā is for protecting sarvajñā, ten powers, eighteen exclusive dharmas, five eyes, five-part dharma-body, four immeasurable minds, all merit-results—Extensively raising its causes to enhance its results. Wishing to clarify that causes have no separate causes, they become causes through results. Results have no separate results because they become results through causes. Therefore protecting causes is precisely protecting results. The eighteen exclusive dharmas etc. extensively raise result-virtues.

When Buddha taught the dharma, immeasurable multitudes all attained dharma-eye purity, nature-ground, faith-ground—Clarifying various people's enlightenment. Dharma-eye purity is the path of seeing in the Lesser Vehicle. Initially realizing the four truths clearly, hence called "dharma-eye purity." Now teaching the Great Vehicle, why do they attain small results? The teaching is one, but receiving awakening differs, so the results attained differ. As the Vimalakīrti Sutra states: "Buddha proclaims dharma with one voice, sentient beings each gain understanding according to their type"—consider this. Also explaining: The Tathāgata spreads clouds of compassion and rains the rain of true characteristics. Large roots and large stems receive great moisture. Small roots and small stems receive small moisture. Awakening lies in the roots of beings, not in the dharma. 《Split writing: etc.》 Nature-ground means from the ten understandings upward. Faith-ground is the ten faiths downward.

Hundreds of thousands of people all attained great emptiness, bodhisattva great practice—From the first ground upward, the two emptinesses increase and the mind merges with great tranquility, called "great emptiness." Great practice means the eighty-four thousand degrees from the first ground upward.

《Title: Commentary on the Benevolent Kings Sutra, Middle Volume》
Benevolent Kings Prajñāpāramitā Sutra, Chapter Three: Bodhisattva Teaching and Transformation

Addressing the Buddha: "World-Honored One, how should bodhisattvas who protect the ten-ground practices practice? How should they practice to transform sentient beings? What characteristics of sentient beings should be transformed?"—The previous chapter relied on emptiness to protect Buddha-result, which is skillful means being true characteristics. This chapter relies on the five forbearances and ten grounds to transform sentient beings, which is true wisdom being skillful means. Hence called "Teaching and Transformation Chapter." This chapter divides into two: first questions, then answers. In the questions, "how should they practice?" 《Split writing: [note] "ya" probably should be "sha"》 asks what dharma practices should be relied upon for cultivation to accomplish the ten grounds and attain self-practice. The second, "how should they practice to transform sentient beings?" asks what dharmas bodhisattvas should use in external transformation to transform sentient beings. The third, "what characteristics of sentient beings should be transformed?" asks about the essence and characteristics of sentient beings to be transformed.

Buddha said: "Great King, the five forbearances are bodhisattva dharmas"—From below answering the previous questions. Divided into three sections. From "The five forbearances are bodhisattva dharmas" to "fourteen forbearances complete"—first answering the self-benefit question. From "Addressing Buddha: how is bodhisattva fundamental practice pure" to "various spirits and deities manifest bodies to practice"—second answering external transformative practices. From "Buddha told Great King, your previous words" to the end of the chapter—third answering the question.

Forbearance of submission upper-middle-lower, forbearance of faith upper-middle-lower, forbearance of compliance upper-middle-lower, forbearance of non-arising upper-middle-lower, forbearance of tranquil extinction upper-lower are called all buddhas and bodhisattvas cultivating prajñāpāramitā—This is the abbreviated explanation of the five forbearances. Forbearance of submission is skillful means practice for attaining sagehood. Forbearance of faith is the initial gate for entering sagehood. Forbearance of compliance is the proximate condition for according with non-arising.

【Upper section of left page】
Forbearance of non-arising is the capacity directed toward result. Forbearance of tranquil extinction combines cause and result in explanation. Forbearance of submission upper-middle-lower: habitual forbearance is lower, nature forbearance is middle, path-seed forbearance is upper. The position is in the three worthies. Forbearance of faith upper-middle-lower: first ground is lower, second ground is middle, third ground is upper. Forbearance of compliance upper-middle-lower: fourth ground is lower, fifth ground is middle, sixth ground is upper. Forbearance of non-arising upper-middle-lower: seventh ground is lower, eighth ground is middle, ninth ground is upper. Forbearance of tranquil extinction upper-lower: tenth ground is lower, Buddha-ground is upper. 《Split writing: etc.》

Good sons, initially arousing characteristic faith, Ganges sands of sentient beings cultivate forbearance of submission, generating habitual seed-nature ten minds within the Three Jewels: faith-mind, diligence-mind, mindfulness-mind, wisdom-mind, concentration-mind, giving-mind, precept-mind, protection-mind, vow-mind, dedication-mind. This enables bodhisattvas to transform a small portion of sentient beings, having already transcended the two vehicles and all good grounds. All buddhas nourish the ten minds as the sacred embryo—From "Good sons" below, extensively differentiating the fourteen forbearances. Opening the five forbearances into fourteen forbearances. Clarifying habitual seed-nature, called "habitual forbearance." The position is the ten understandings. Commentary states: Generating habitual seed-nature within the Three Jewels means the principles of the Three Jewels are precisely result-dharmas. Establishing aspirations is far-reaching. Therefore not timid or weak toward the Three Jewels. Diligent encouragement is precisely the fundamental nature of ten faiths that believes and practices all-seed wisdom. Transcending the two-vehicle grounds means this is Great Vehicle understanding, hence surpassing the two vehicles. Accomplishing Great Vehicle dharma-body seeds is called "sacred embryo." This is lower forbearance.

Next sequentially arising dry wisdom nature seed-nature, having ten kinds of minds: the so-called four foundations of mindfulness (body, feelings, mind, dharmas—impurity, suffering, impermanence, non-self), three foundations of mindfulness (three good roots—loving-kindness, giving, wisdom), three foundations of mindfulness (namely the three times—past cause forbearance, present cause-effect forbearance, future result forbearance)—Second, clarifying middle forbearance

【Lower section of left page】
The text on nature seed-nature divides into three parts. First expressing nature seed-nature ten minds. From "namely《Split writing: [note] above "namely" should probably have the character "two"》" below, correctly listing the ten minds. From "these《Split writing: [note] above "these" probably missing the character "three"》 bodhisattvas" below, clarifying the function of middle forbearance. Sequentially arising dry wisdom means in Lesser Vehicle dharma, outside habitual seeds there is separately a prior dry wisdom ground. Because one hasn't yet attained theoretical understanding to moisten the mind. Now this, in contrast to the true understanding of the first ground, calls seed-nature "dry wisdom ground." The four foundations of mindfulness are precisely the four mindfulness practices—consider this. The three foundations of mindfulness are precisely the three good roots. They counter the three poisons of greed, hatred, and delusion. Now listing hatred, greed, delusion—consider this. The three foundations of mindfulness are the twelve-link dependent origination of three times and two layers. Past cause forbearance refers to past ignorance and formations. Present cause-effect forbearance refers to present three causes and five results. Future result forbearance refers to future birth, aging, and death. The diagram states:

First ignorance link┬Sixth consciousness associated, primary independent action. Unshared ignorance. Pervades both seed and manifest
　　　　　　　　　│Only discriminating afflictions. Capable-drawing link.
Second formations link─┴Sixth consciousness associated good and unwholesome mental factors of volition. Pervades both seed and manifest, only general
　　　　　　　　　　　karmic retribution. Also not karma for present experience.
Third consciousness link─┬Future-to-be-born eighth consciousness weak and morally neutral seeds.
Fourth name-form link┤Future-to-be-born five-aggregate dharmas excluding consciousness, six sense-fields, contact, and feeling.
　　　　　　　　　　│Weak morally neutral seeds. Name refers to the four non-form aggregates. Form refers to the

Fifth six sense-fields link┤Future-to-be-born eye and other six sense-faculties' weak morally neutral seeds.

Habit-nature has copper wheels ruling two continents　　　Silver wheels, three heavens' nature-seed nature
Path-seed is the firm-virtue wheel-turning king　　　Seven treasures' golden light over four continents

The following seven lines explain the above thirty minds of pre-ground subjugation forbearance. Within this, these two lines separately praise the three grades as three types of wheel-turning kings—a doctrinal interpretation. The textual meaning is clear.

Subjugation forbearance sacred embryo thirty persons　　Ten faiths, ten cessations, ten firm minds

This one line lists the thirty minds of subjugation forbearance. "Sacred embryo" means becoming the embryo for the ten sages.

The buddhas of three times practice within this　　　None are not born through this subjugation forbearance
The fundamental source of all bodhisattva practices　　　Therefore generating mind and faith-mind are difficult
If one attains faith-mind, one will never retreat　　Advancing into the no-arising path of the first ground
Teaching and transforming sentient beings, practicing within awakening　　This is called the bodhisattva's initial generation of mind

These four lines explain the function of subjugation forbearance, divided into three sections. The first three sentences clarify that subjugation forbearance can give birth to all buddhas and worthies-sages. The next three sentences clarify the function of generating mind. The next line generally concludes the previous three sentences. Also divided into two: the first sentence clarifies the buddhas of three times—this cites the persons who emerge. The next two sentences present the source that can give birth. The next three sentences become three parts: the first sentence clarifies praising the generation of mind; the next sentence clarifies the non-retreat of the seventh abode; the next sentence clarifies the skillful means of non-retreat and the realized path. From "teaching and transforming sentient beings" below generally concludes the transformative practices of cause and result—consider this.

Good Awakening Bodhisattva Four Heavenly Kings　　　Dually illuminating the equal path of two truths

【Lower section of right page】
Provisionally transforming sentient beings, traveling through hundreds of lands　　First ascending to the one-vehicle formless path
Entering principle-prajñā is called abiding　　　The virtue-practices of abiding-birth are called ground
First abiding, one mind perfects virtue-practices　　　In ultimate meaning, unmoving

Good Awakening transformation ten practices. The third section praises faith forbearance, divided into two parts. The previous eight lines explain the above three grounds' three forbearances. The lower two lines conclude and praise the previous eight lines. Also divided into three: the first four lines recite the above first ground faith forbearance lower grade; the next two lines recite the above second ground faith forbearance middle grade; the next two lines recite the above third ground faith forbearance upper grade. The previous four lines are divided into two: the previous one and a half lines praise the first ground bodhisattva's merit of being able to universally transform; the second two and a half lines clarify the function of entering the ground. Also divided into three: the first sentence clarifies the enhanced birth of appropriated result; next clarifies the contemplative practice within the ground—realizing and meeting no-arising, reaching truth and transforming the conventional is called "dual illumination"; because compassion and wisdom proceed together, it's called "equal"; next clarifies the extent of transforming lands within the ground. Within the second function are five sentences making five distinctions: the first sentence transcends the ordinary to attain the sage, entering the one-vehicle no-thought path; the next sentence clarifies the victory of what the entering-ground mind enters, called "abiding"; the next sentence clarifies generating buddha-wisdom, called "ground"; the next sentence concludes the ground-fulfillment mind; the next sentence clarifies that mind-characteristics are no-arising, awakening to principle without movement, hence saying "in ultimate meaning, unmoving."

being. Trāyastriṃśa means king within the ground. The next sentence clarifies the extent of the transformed lands. The next sentence's "no-conditions" means having no internal mental conditions. "No-characteristics" means having no characteristics of the two truths. Separating from these conditional characteristics is called the "third truth." Also said: "no-conditions" means knowing the mind has no conditions; "no-characteristics" means knowing form has no characteristics. These two being essentially empty is called the "third truth." The next sentence's "no-no" means having no true and conventional two truths, hence called "no-no." "No-arising" is precisely the no-arising of the first ground. "No dual illumination" means having no true-conventional dual views, hence called "no dual illumination."

Bright Wisdom Empty Illumination Flame Heaven King　　Responding with forms across ten thousand lands, guiding multitudes of beings
Forbearance-mind without duality within three truths　　Exiting existence, entering non-existence, transformation birth

These two lines praise the above third ground faith forbearance upper grade, divided into four parts. The first sentence explains the ground name, presenting the king within the ground. The next sentence clarifies the transformed lands. The next sentence clarifies faith forbearance upper grade—entering the three truths to illuminate realms, exhausting form-mind empty truth is called "within three truths." "Exiting existence, entering non-existence" clarifies that third ground bodhisattvas condition existence to transform beings without attachment—this is exiting existence, namely in existence knowing emptiness is called "entering non-existence." Supernaturally altering, hence called "transformation birth."

Good Awakening, Separation, Brightness—three path persons　　Able to extinguish the three realms' form afflictions
Again observing the three realms' body-speech forms　　Dharma-nature supreme, no omitted illumination

These two lines generally recite the above faith forbearance. The first sentence recites the previous three stages: Awakening is first ground, Separation is second ground, Brightness is third ground, hence called "three path persons." The second sentence praises the merit of severance—being able to extinguish form afflictions

clarifies the ground's severance of obstructions; this place refers to transformation form afflictions. "Body-speech forms" means transformation forms. Observing forms as identical to dharma-nature, hence called "no omitted illumination." The above is concluding text—consider this.

Flame Radiance Wondrous Light Great Vigor　　　Tuṣita Heaven King traveling through billion lands
True wisdom conditions tranquility, skillful means path　　Reaching no-arising, illuminating and understanding emptiness-existence

The following eight lines recite the above compliance forbearance from fourth ground and above, broadly divided into two parts. The previous six lines praise compliance forbearance; the latter two lines make a general conclusion. The six lines become three parts: the first two lines explain the lower grade; the next two lines explain the middle grade; the latter two lines explain the upper grade. The previous two lines become four parts: the first sentence's "vigor" means fourth ground's vigor is predominant; the next sentence clarifies the king within the ground and the transformed lands; next clarifying "true wisdom"—fourth ground makes others realize, hence called true wisdom. Pure non-attachment is precisely the skillful means path. This true wisdom is the truth of true-skillful means. The ground is called "true," hence saying "conditioning the true." True wisdom contemplates emptiness; skillful means wisdom illuminates existence, hence saying "reaching no-arising, illuminating and understanding emptiness-existence."

Superior Wisdom Three Truths Self-Reaching Brightness　　Transformation Medicine Heaven King, hundred billion lands
Empty-emptiness truth-contemplation without dual characteristics　　Transforming the six destinies, entering no-interval

These two lines, four sentences: the first sentence is the ground name, self-reaching the three brightnesses; the next sentence clarifies the transformed lands. "Empty-emptiness" means using emptiness to eliminate emptiness, hence called "empty-emptiness." "Without dual characteristics" means without the characteristics of two truths. The next sentence clarifies transforming beings in the six destinies.

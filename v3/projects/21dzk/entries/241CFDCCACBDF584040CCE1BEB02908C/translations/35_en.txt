This is the explanation. Think carefully about it.

Constantly cultivating all practices, fulfilling the treasury of merit, entering the bhāgaduta position, and also constantly dwelling in Buddha-wisdom samādhi. The commentary says: From "constantly cultivating all practices" below is the third conclusion of contemplative position. "Entering bhāgaduta" means this is called "Ground of Bestowing Virtue." Because one can teach the dharma like clouds and rain, it is also called "Ground of Breaking Through." Because concentration and wisdom are complete, it is called "Buddha-wisdom samādhi."

Good son, such bodhisattvas are all able to transform sentient beings in the buddha-lands of all tathāgatas in the ten directions, correctly expound right principles, receive, uphold, recite and comprehend the true characteristics, equal to me today without any difference. The commentary says: From "Good son, like this" below, the direct answer has three chapters: first brief answer, second detailed answer, the two sections conclude. Now the third general conclusion has three parts. First clarifying that the thirteen dharma-masters can propagate and transform the Mahāyāna. Therefore saying "such bodhisattvas are all able to guide and transform sentient beings in all ten directions." From "expounding right principles" below, second clarifying that the thirteen dharma-masters can expound right principles. Right principles means precisely the true characteristics of all phenomena. From "like me" below, third clarifying that what is expounded has no differences. This difference clarifies that the thirteen persons can equally transform like Buddha, therefore saying "equal without any difference."

Buddha told King Prasenajit: "After my extinction, when the dharma is about to be completely destroyed, all kings should receive and uphold this Prajñāpāramitā and greatly perform Buddha-works. The peaceful establishment of all lands and the happiness of all people all depend on this Prajñāpāramitā. Therefore I entrust it to the kings, not to monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen. Why? Because without royal authority and power, therefore not

entrusting to you. You should receive, uphold, recite, and understand its principles." The commentary says: From "Buddha told King Prasenajit" below. In answering the question, the second major section is encouragement to uphold. The text has seven sections. First, briefly raising the time period to clarify the intention of entrusting to kings rather than others. Within this are two parts. First clarifying entrusting kings to receive and uphold Prajñā. Second, from "not entrusting monks" below, next clarifying that without royal power and influence, therefore not entrusting, but only having them receive, uphold, recite and interpret the principles. Not being king has two meanings: first, able to transform difficult-to-transform sentient beings; second, benefiting great persons like wind bending grass. Monks lack such power, therefore cannot be entrusted.

Great King, what I now transform includes billions of Sumerus, billions of suns and moons. Each Sumeru has four continents. In the southern Jambudvīpa there are sixteen great countries, five hundred middle countries, ten thousand small countries. Second, clarifying the places where Prajñā is propagated. Saying "Great King, what I now transform includes billions of Mount Sumeru, etc." Generally clarifying the realm of Jambudvīpa. From "In the southern Jambudvīpa" below specifically clarifies the various lands. Consider as the text indicates.

I say privately: Beyond ten thousand countries are called "great countries." Below ten thousand countries, above four thousand are called "middle countries." Below three thousand, above seven hundred are called "small countries." Below six hundred, above two hundred are called "scattered-millet countries." Less than one hundred countries are called island countries - though this is not stated. Tang land has 1,944 countries, therefore called "small countries." Japan is an island, not within the country classification. However, when Nichira, the superior person from Baekje country, bowed to Prince Shōtoku, he said: "Respectfully saluting Avalokiteśvara, transmitting the lamp to the eastern scattered-millet king, coming from the west to be born, expounding the wonderful dharma to liberate sentient beings." From this, Japan entered within the scattered-millet countries.

The above is a secret treasury matter. The classification of large, medium, and small has not yet been investigated. It should not be propagated carelessly.

In those lands there are seven fearful disasters. All kings, because of these disasters, lecture and recite the Prajñāpāramitā. The seven disasters are immediately extinguished, seven blessings immediately arise, all people are peaceful and happy, and the emperor rejoices. From "In those lands" below. Third, clarifying the seven disasters. The text has two parts. First, generally clarifying that dharma power can extinguish seven disasters and generate seven blessings. The text is clear.

What constitutes disaster? The sun and moon losing their courses, seasons reversing, red suns appearing, black suns appearing, two, three, four, or five suns appearing, solar eclipses without light, or the solar disc appearing as one, two, three, four, or five rings. When such strange transformations occur, reciting this sutra constitutes the first disaster. The commentary says: From "What constitutes disaster" below, separately listing the seven disasters, clarifying that sutra power can extinguish them. The "seven disasters" are: first, sun and moon losing course; second, stellar anomalies; third, fire disasters; fourth, water disasters; fifth, wind disasters; sixth, drought disasters; seventh, bandits. Within the first sun-moon disaster are fourteen types: first, clarifying loss of course - not following the regular path is called losing course; second, clarifying seasonal reversal; third, red sun appearing; fourth, black sun appearing; fifth, two suns appearing; sixth, three suns appearing; seventh, four suns appearing; eighth, five suns appearing; ninth, solar eclipse; tenth, sun with one ring; eleventh, double rings; twelfth, triple rings; thirteenth, quadruple rings; fourteenth, quintuple rings. Such fourteen types are all disasters, envisioning famine, warfare, and epidemics.

stars each manifesting changes, reciting and expounding constitutes the second disaster. The second stellar disaster. Twenty-eight means each of the four directions has seven - four times seven equals twenty-eight. Losing course means their movement doesn't follow the regular path, therefore called losing course. Venus is the Great White Star. The Tripiṭaka master says foreign countries call it "Celestial Master Star." If it moves according to principle, there's abundance; if it loses course, there's famine. Comets are called "Yama King Star" in foreign countries. Wherever this star appears, there are necessarily disasters. Ring stars have brilliance like a wheel. If the sun, moon, and five planets break through the center of a ring star, then the land is scattered. If the sun and moon travel to the right of the ring star, then the land is peaceful. Leftward movement is also not good. Ghost stars: in the ninth month at sunset, located in the northeast. If moving rapidly, this exceeds the proper time. If approaching the upper position, then demons come to destroy the country and afflict people. Mars is the Glowing Confuser Star. This governs bandits. If high, bandits arise; if low, bandits are subdued. If in the rat position, it's low; if in the horse position, it's high. Mercury is the Moisture Star, also the Great White Star. If in tiger position, it's low; if in monkey position, it's high. It travels thirty days in one position, completing one circuit in twelve months. Traveling from rooster, dog, pig, rat positions, there's no water. From rabbit, snake, sheep, monkey positions, water is abundant. From ox, tiger, dragon, horse positions, water is balanced - balanced means neither too much nor too little. Wind star is the Pleiades star. In tiger position it's high. It travels thirty days per position. When traveling through monkey position it's low. If high, much wind and no rain. If low, much rain and little wind. High in seventh month, low in first month. From eighth month to first month, gradually descending. From second month to seventh month, gradually ascending. Following solar movement, there are three types. Second, third, eighth, ninth months move together with the sun. Tenth, eleventh, twelfth, first months - these four months travel ahead of the sun. Fourth, fifth

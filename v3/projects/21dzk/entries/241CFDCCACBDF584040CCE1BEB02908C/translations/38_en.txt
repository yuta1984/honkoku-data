Conventional truth samādhi: Based on what ordinary beings see, it clarifies the characteristics of concentration, therefore called "conventional truth." Ultimate truth samādhi: Based on the partial truth seen by the two vehicles, therefore called "ultimate truth." Supreme truth samādhi: This is the middle way supreme truth.

They also attained immeasurable other samādhis: seven treasures samādhi, twenty-five existences samādhi, all-practices samādhi. Furthermore, there were one billion bodhisattvas who ascended to the vajra peak and manifested perfect enlightenment. The commentary says: The seven treasures are: first faith, second precepts, third shame, fourth embarrassment, fifth extensive learning, sixth wisdom, seventh renunciation. The twenty-five existences means destroying the twenty-five existences. Attaining the stainless samādhi can destroy hell existence. Attaining the non-retreating samādhi can destroy animal existence. Attaining the mind-joy samādhi can destroy hungry ghost existence. Attaining the joyful samādhi can destroy asura existence. Attaining the sunlight samādhi cuts off Pūrvavideha existence. Attaining the moonlight samādhi cuts off Aparagodānīya existence. Attaining the blazing flame samādhi cuts off Uttarakuru existence. Attaining the illusion-like samādhi cuts off Jambudvīpa existence.

Attaining the pleasing samādhi cuts off Yāma heaven existence. Attaining the blue-colored samādhi cuts off Tuṣita heaven existence.

dhi cuts off the space-sphere existence. Attaining the permanence samādhi cuts off the consciousness-sphere existence. Attaining the bliss samādhi cuts off the nothing-sphere existence. Attaining the self samādhi cuts off the neither-perception-nor-non-perception sphere existence. This is called bodhisattvas attaining the twenty-five existences samādhi and destroying the twenty-five existences: four existences, four evil destinies, Brahmā king, six desires, four dhyānas, four formless realms, no-thought, five pure dwellings. From "Furthermore, one billion bodhisattvas" below: Sixth, one billion bodhisattvas attain Buddhahood.

Benevolent Kings Protecting the Country Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, Entrustment Chapter Eight
The commentary says: The sūtra has three sections. This is now the third, the circulation section. Speaking of entrustment means clarifying how the Tathāgata earnestly entrusts to kings and burdens the assembly of bodhisattvas. Therefore it is called the Entrustment Chapter. This chapter is divided into four sections. First, admonishing and instructing Moonlight, generally encouraging circulation to clarify entrustment. From "In the later five-turbidity age" below: Second, using seven approaches to separately admonish various country kings and the four groups of disciples. From "At that time the sixteen great country kings heard the Buddha's seven admonishments" below: Third, clarifying that the various country kings do not restrain the four groups of disciples. From "At that time the immeasurable great assembly" below: Fourth, clarifying that the assembly at that time joyfully received and upheld.

The Buddha told King Prasenajit: "I admonish and instruct you all. After my extinction, in eighty years, eight hundred years, eight thousand years, when there is no Buddha, no Dharma, no Saṅgha, no faithful men and women, I entrust this sūtra and Three Jewels to various country kings and the four groups of disciples to receive, uphold, recite, and explain its meaning, opening the path of emptiness-wisdom for sentient beings of the three realms, cultivating the seven worthy practices and ten good practices, transforming all sentient beings." The commentary says: Eighty years refers to after the Buddha's extinction. In the hundred years after the Buddha's extinction, five teachers each upheld the Dharma for twenty years. Kāśya-

pa, Ānanda, Madhyāntika - these three people personally witnessed the Buddha's teaching and practiced the Dharma. Because it was like when the Buddha was in the world, the Dharma did not perish. The three people spanned sixty years. Fourth was Śāṇakavāsin, fifth was Upagupta. These two teachers each upheld the Dharma for twenty years. Śāṇakavāsin was at the eighty-year mark. Because he did not personally witness the Buddha's teaching, the deportment dharma perished. Speaking of eight hundred years means the extinction of right realization dharma. Within five hundred years, twenty-five teachers were all sages transmitting successively, so the realization dharma did not perish. Within the sixth and seventh two hundred years, Aśvaghoṣa and Nāgārjuna transmitted the Dharma. Because the dharma-propagating people were strong, the Dharma did not perish. In eight hundred years, other people propagated the Dharma. Because the people were weak, they caused the Dharma to perish. Speaking of eight thousand years means the extinction of the semblance and final dharma. Because sentient beings in the final dharma period prefer to practice evil dharma, despise the right dharma and do not practice it. Only the semblance and final two dharmas perish. The meaning of entrustment is clear in the text. Third, clarifying circulation benefits. "Opening the path of emptiness-wisdom for sentient beings of the three realms" means because they realize the understanding of no-attainment, it is called opening the path of emptiness-wisdom. Also, because they realize the principle of two selflessnesses, it is called opening the path of emptiness-wisdom. Speaking of "cultivating seven worthy practices" means the seven expedients: first, five stopping-mind contemplations; second, individual-characteristic mindfulness contemplations; third, general-characteristic mindfulness contemplations; fourth, warmth dharma; fifth, summit dharma; sixth, forbearance dharma; seventh, supreme worldly dharma. The meaning of ten goods is as usual.

In the later five-turbidity age, bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, the four groups of disciples, the eight classes of gods and dragons, all spirit kings, country kings, great ministers, crown princes, and princes, relying on their high nobility, will destroy my Dharma, clearly creating restrictive laws, restricting my four groups of disciples - bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs - not allowing them to leave home and practice the Way, also not allowing the creation of Buddha image forms and Buddha stupa forms, establishing controlling officials to restrict the assembly, installing registers to record monks, placing laypeople on high

seats above bhikṣu positions, making soldiers and slaves into bhikṣus, accepting special invitation dharmas, joining with acquaintance bhikṣus in one mind, creating feast assemblies for friendly bhikṣus, seeking merit like the dharma of non-Buddhists - all this is not my Dharma. You should know that at that time the right Dharma will perish before long. The commentary says: From "In the later five-turbidity age" below, the second seven-approach separate admonishment, making seven separate points: First, one must not obstruct people from leaving home, etc. Second, one must not use secular officials to govern monks. Third, one must not bind bhikṣus. Fourth, one must not teach sūtras unlawfully, like worms inside the lion's body. Fifth, one must not conscript bhikṣus like the law of soldiers and slaves. Sixth, clarifying unlawful gains as sins, restricting them and not doing them - creating sins and transgressions oneself destroys the country and land. Seventh, one must not rely on Buddha-dharma to seek worldly fame and profit. If one does these seven things, violating teachings and losing principle, righteous practice cannot be established. Because of this meaning, the Buddha-dharma quickly perishes. In the first "one must not obstruct people from leaving home," there are two parts: First, generally clarifying the five turbidities. Second, from "bhikṣus" below, separately clarifying seven matters. The five turbidities are: first, sentient being turbidity; second, life turbidity; third, view turbidity; fourth, affliction turbidity; fifth, kalpa turbidity. Second, from "bhikṣus" below, separately clarifying seven matters: First, not allowing leaving home; second, not allowing making images, etc.; third, establishing controlling officials; fourth, installing registers to record monks; fifth, not placing laypeople on high seats above bhikṣu positions; sixth, not making soldiers and slaves into bhikṣus; seventh, not accepting special invitation practice dharmas. When seven evil dharmas flourish, seven right dharmas perish.

Great King, disrupting and disturbing my Way is your own doing - relying on your威力 and restricting my four groups of disciples. The people suffer illness with no苦難 they do not experience - this is the causal condition for destroying the country. Speaking of the sins and transgressions of the five turbidities, they cannot be exhausted even through countless kalpas. The commentary says: From "Great King disrupting and disturbing my Way" below. Second, one must not use secular officials to govern monks. Speaking of "self-

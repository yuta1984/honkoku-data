From "names, flavors, phrases" below. In the fourth part of the answer, comparison is made to reveal superiority. The Śāstra states: One character is called a character, two characters are called a name. Up to four characters form a phrase. Sometimes three, four, or eight characters are all called phrases. The reason below phrases is called flavor. 《Split writing: text》 "Hundreds of buddhas, thousands of buddhas, etc." clarifies that the Way of all buddhas is the same.

Filling the Ganges sands' worth of three-thousand great-thousand worlds with immeasurable seven treasures and giving them to sentient beings in the three-thousand great-thousand worlds, causing them all to attain the seven stages of worthies and four fruits, does not compare to arousing one moment of faith in this sutra, much less understanding one phrase—This clarifies comparison. First it clarifies material giving. From "all attain the seven worthies" below clarifies dharma-giving. "In this sutra" etc. clarifies that faith in no-attainment prajñā surpasses the merit of the previous two givings of material and dharma with attainment. The textual meaning is clear.

Phrases are not phrases, not non-phrases, therefore prajñā is not phrases, phrases are not prajñā, prajñā is also not bodhisattva—Commentary states: "Phrases not phrases" means phrases have no phrase-characteristics. Also no non-phrase characteristics exist. Therefore "not non-phrases." Also, saying "phrases not phrases" means conversely that the nature of characters is separate. "Not non-phrases" means negating the previous two phrases. "Prajñā not phrases, phrases not prajñā" means prajñā is wisdom, phrases are text. Both text and wisdom are completely without existence, so it says "prajñā not phrases, phrases not prajñā." "Prajñā also not bodhisattva" means person and dharma are distinctly separate. This is distinction without distinction 《Split writing: [note] below "distinction," Tripitaka commentary has the character "of"》. 《Split writing: text》

Why? Because the thirty births of the ten grounds are empty, beginning-birth 《Split writing: [note] entering》, dwelling-birth 《Split writing: [note] dwelling》, ending-birth 《Split writing: [note] exiting》 cannot be obtained. Because the three births in each ground are empty, they are also not sarvajñā 《Split writing: [note] result》, not mahāyāna 《Split writing: [note] cause》, being empty—Commentary states: From "Why?" below explains that both person and dharma above are empty. "The thirty births of ten grounds being empty" means:

【Lower section of right page】
Dividing prajñā into ten parts makes the ten grounds. Each ground has three births. Combined they become no-birth—consider this. "Also not" etc. means when it's cause-time, it's not result. "Not mahāyāna" means illumination is not the meaning of conveyance. "Also" means prajñā is not only "not bodhisattva," but also "not result-wisdom and vehicle-meaning"—consider this.

Great King, if a bodhisattva sees realm, sees wisdom, sees teaching, sees receiver, this is not sage-seeing—Commentary states: From "Great King, bodhisattva sees realm" etc. below. In the fifth part of the answer, it concludes raising non-existence to reveal existence above. The text divides into two: first raising non-existence. From "six consciousnesses" below reveals existence. Seeing realm is dust-attachment. Seeing wisdom is consciousness-attachment. Seeing receiver is person-attachment. Because these do not see the two emptinesses of person and dharma, they are called "not sage-seeing."

Seeing dharma through inverted thoughts is ordinary people—Violating principle and opposing sages is called ordinary people. 《Split writing: text》

Seeing the three realms is the name of sentient beings' karmic retribution—The three realms are the vessel-world's three realms. Retribution is the dwelling place that sentient beings experience and use.

Six consciousnesses arising immeasurable desires, being endless is called desire-realm store emptiness—From below, it concludes to reveal existence and clarifies the meaning of emptiness. The text divides into two: first clarifying defiled dharma emptiness, from "sarvajñā" below clarifying pure dharma emptiness. In the first section, it first clarifies birth-death by stages, from "fundamental ignorance" below clarifies transformation birth-death. "Six consciousnesses arising immeasurable" etc. means arising from the five desires and universally generating afflictions. Because they arise depending on desires, they're called "store." "Empty" means the essence itself is non-existent. 《Split writing: etc.》

Karmic results arising from being deluded by form are called form-realm store emptiness—The formless realm has four aggregates, so it's called mind. Regarding afflictions, there is the abode of love. Three realms empty—general conclusion.

【Upper section of left page】
The fundamental ignorance store of the three realms is also empty—From below, transformation birth-death is clarified, divided into two parts. First clarifying cause-emptiness, next clarifying result-emptiness. This is cause-emptiness.

Three grounds, nine births-extinctions—This clarifies result-emptiness, with two meanings. One meaning: the eighth, ninth, and tenth grounds each have three minds, combined as nine births-extinctions. One meaning: within the three realms of transformation, each has three types of mind-born bodies. From first ground to fifth ground is called "samādhi-bliss-practice mind-born body." The sixth and seventh grounds are called "awareness-dharma-self-nature mind-born body." From eighth ground upward is called "type-simultaneous-birth effortless-practice mind-born body"—consider this.

Karmic retribution of remaining ignorance-habits in the previous three realms is empty—Above clarified the active agents of the five positions. This speaks of ignorance habit-energy.

Because Vajra Bodhisattva attains the samādhi of principle-exhaustion—This is the tenth-ground bodhisattva's illumination exhausting and completing causes, so it's called "principle-exhaustion."

Defilement-result birth-extinction emptiness—Because of subtle habits, it's called defilement. Defilement means all afflictions. Result means all results of the three realms and beyond the realms. Birth-extinction emptiness is unobstructed-path emptiness.

Existence-result emptiness—The suffering truth being without characteristics is called "existence-result emptiness."

Cause emptiness—The accumulation truth being without arising is called "cause emptiness."

Therefore empty—From above, clarifying defiled dharma emptiness is completed.

Sarvajñā is also empty—From below, pure dharma emptiness is clarified. Sarvajñā clarifies bodhi emptiness.

Extinction-result emptiness—Clarifies nirvana emptiness.

【Lower section of left page】
Because before defilement it was already empty—Commentary states: The Tathāgata has already emerged beyond all defilements. Therefore it says "before defilement already empty." Another explanation: Even when afflictions are not yet cut off, they are originally tranquil-extinct, so it says "before defilement already empty." 《Split writing: text》

Buddha attains three unconditioned results—Generally raising the three virtues.

Wisdom-conditioned extinction—This is analytical cessation unconditioned. Namely, upon the true-suchness principle, depending on the power of wisdom's analytical selection to cut off obstacles and reveal meaning, it's called analytical cessation unconditioned.

Non-wisdom-conditioned extinction—This is non-analytical cessation unconditioned. Namely, upon true-suchness, it's not the gate of analytical extinction cutting off obstacles. Depending on the meaning that the true principle's original nature is inherently pure from the beginning, it's called non-analytical cessation unconditioned.

Empty space—This is empty-space unconditioned. Namely, upon true-suchness, depending on the meaning of non-obstruction, it's called empty-space unconditioned.

Sarvajñā-result emptiness—Clarifies the emptiness of Buddha-result.

Good son, if there is cultivating, practicing, listening, and teaching, there is no listening, no teaching, like empty space—Sixth, encouraging practice, faith, acceptance, and maintenance. This is the meaning of protecting Buddha-results. The Great Perfection states: Listening is like an illusory person listening. Teaching is like an illusory person teaching. Therefore no-listening no-teaching answers the above question. The Vimalakīrti Sutra states: Those who teach dharma have no teaching, no showing. Those who listen to dharma have no hearing, no attainment. Like empty space—consider this text.

Dharma is the same as dharma-nature, listening and teaching are the same, all dharmas are thus—Vimalakīrti states: Dharma being the same as dharma-nature enters all dharmas. Discussing that empty principle, it transcends listening and teaching. Therefore it says "all dharmas are thus."

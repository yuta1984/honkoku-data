"These are name-taste-phrases." The commentary says: From "These are name-taste-phrases" below, subsection two clarifies relying on written words to grasp suchness, not grasping name-words. Within this are five parts. First, name-taste-phrases are what should be explained. Second, sound is what is properly explained. Sound means: first chest, second throat, third pharynx, fourth tongue root, fifth teeth, sixth lips, seventh nose, eighth nape. Through the movement of these, there is vocal explanation. Third, karmic result is what can explain. Fourth, all suchness is precisely what depends on explanation. Depending on this to explain, actually there is no dharma that can be explained. Hence the Diamond Prajñā says "Having no dharma that can be explained is called explaining dharma." Fifth, if one grasps written words, this raises faults to reveal virtues. Clinging to written words as understanding, not realizing the nature-transcendence of written words, is called "not practicing emptiness."

"Sound, result, written words, recorded phrases, all suchness - if one grasps written words, one does not practice emptiness."

"Great King, suchness-suchness written words cultivate the wisdom-mother of all Buddhas." The commentary says: From "Great King, suchness-suchness written words" below, in answering the question, the second section clarifies three types of Buddha-nature. First is present-constant Buddha-nature, second is future-constant Buddha-nature, third is understanding-cause Buddha-nature. Nature is neither future nor present, but regarding conditions, future and present differ. Hence there are explanations of three types. If without dependence, without attainment, following conditions in explanation, there is no fault. If clinging to future and present as definitely real, this becomes disputation. The first, present-constant, in the text says "suchness-suchness written words cultivate the wisdom-mother of all Buddhas, the nature root-wisdom-mother of all sentient beings, precisely the essence of sarva-prajñā." Having previously heard of the suchness of the twelve divisions of scripture, one knows written words are precisely suchness. Suchness is precisely prajñā. Prajñā is the Buddha-mother, hence called "wisdom-mother."

"Nature root-wisdom-mother of all sentient beings." The commentary says: Saying "nature root-wisdom-mother of all sentient beings" means knowing that sentient being nature is unattainable and precisely suchness.

"Precisely becoming the essence of sarvajna." The commentary says: "Precisely the essence of sarvajna" means understanding and realizing that sentient beings and sarvajna are non-one non-dual. What is future, what is present? Because breaking the future, one merely explains the present.

"Buddhas not yet having achieved buddhahood take future Buddha as wisdom-mother, not yet attaining nature." The commentary says: From "Buddhas not yet achieved" below, the second section clarifies future-fruition Buddha-nature. How can one know? The text says "Buddhas not yet having achieved buddhahood take future Buddha as wisdom-mother, not yet attaining nature." Hence knowing future-having is not present-having. Present-having means having hidden nature. Future-nothing means having no future nature. Hence knowing that because manifest it is called future; because hidden it is called present. Discussing actual nature, the essence transcends all characteristics - neither future nor present. Due to causes and conditions, one merely explains future and present.

"Having already attained sarvajna, three-vehicle prajñā is unborn unceasing, self-nature permanently abiding, all sentient beings take this as awakening-nature." The commentary says: From "having attained" below, the third section clarifies understanding-cause Buddha-nature. Clarifying that three-vehicle prajñā brings forth understanding of the unborn unceasing. Through attaining prajñā right-contemplation, embodying knowledge that the born do not arise and the ceasing do not cease, hence saying "self-nature permanently abiding." All sentient beings through false causes and conditions revolve through the six destinies. Embody-

knowing that falsity has no origin, precisely being unborn unceasing, hence saying "taking this self-nature permanent abiding as awakening-nature."

"If bodhisattvas have no accepting, no written words, separate from written words, not non-written words." The commentary says: From "If bodhisattvas" below, in answering the question, the third section presents methods of cultivation, having two parts. First presenting cultivation methods. The text saying "no written words, separate from written words, not written words" means knowing the nature-transcendence of written words, the mind having nothing to depend on. Text and principle both mysterious, cultivation and non-cultivation both quiescent. Hence saying "not non-written words."

"Having no cultivation, making cultivation, those who cultivate written words attain prajñā true-nature prajñāpāramitā." The commentary says: The second part, from "those who cultivate written words" below, clarifies embodying knowledge of the above cultivation methods. Through embodying knowledge of prajñā cultivation, one can be called nature-prajñā. Taking no-attainment as attainment - actually there is no attainment.

"Great King, if bodhisattvas protect Buddha, protect and transform sentient beings, protect ten-stage practices, if like this." The commentary says: From "Great King, if bodhisattvas protect Buddha-fruition" below, in answering the question, the fourth section concludes the above protecting and transforming sentient beings, protecting ten-stage practices, able protector and protected, also depending on cultivation methods. Protecting Buddha means protecting fruition. Protecting ten stages means protecting causes. Protecting and transforming sentient beings is altruistic practice.

"Addressing the Buddha: Immeasurable categories of sentient beings, roots also immeasurable, practices also immeasurable - are dharma gates one, two, or immeasurable?" The commentary says: From "Addressing the Buddha, immeasurable sentient beings" below, the third question and answer clarifies dharma gate non-duality. Within this are two parts. First questioning, then answering. First Moonlight raises the transformed sentient beings. "Immeasurable categories" clarifies their personal distinctions. "Roots also immeasurable" clarifies their root distinctions. "Practices also immeasurable" clarifies their practice

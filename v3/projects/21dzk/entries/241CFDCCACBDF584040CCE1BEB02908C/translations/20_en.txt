Simultaneous cause-effect. As for sequential: when past two causes are regarded in relation to present five effects, it is called sequential. Also said: simultaneous causes are conditioning causes, sequential causes are productive causes. Speaking of external dharmas, beams and rafters constituting a house is called simultaneous, and twelve hours constituting a day is called sequential cause-effect.

Great King, if bodhisattvas see as above that sentient beings' illusions are all conventionally deceptive like flowers in space, and the five faculties of ten-stage bodhisattvas and buddhas see like illusory truth while bodhisattvas transform sentient beings—at such times, among the immeasurable divine beings and great assemblies, there are those who attain patient forbearance, those who attain emptiness non-arising patience, and even those who attain the inconceivable virtuous practices of the first through tenth grounds. The commentary says: The third section from "Great King" below clarifies that the five faculties of buddhas and bodhisattvas are also called conventional truth. The text says "if bodhisattvas see as above that sentient beings' illusions are like flowers in space." Sentient beings are fundamentally without substantial existence and exist through falsity, like flowers in space. The five faculties of buddhas see like illusion, knowing in accordance with conditions and understanding in accordance with principle. Illuminating-conditioning observation merges in profound unity, hence saying "it is thus." From "at that time among the immeasurable" below, the third major section in answering the question clarifies hearing the dharma and obtaining benefit. The initial section from "divine beings" below clarifies those who attain the Way, and from "patient forbearance" below clarifies the distinctions in benefits obtained. The three worthies before the grounds are called patient forbearance; emptiness patience refers to the fourth ground and above, according with signless emptiness. The seventh ground and above is called non-arising patience; the first three grounds are faith patience, though this is not explained in detail. The first ground is called "first ground," and reaching the dharma-cloud is called "tenth ground." Vast like empty space is called ineffable virtuous practice.

Humane Kings' Protection-State Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, Chapter Four: Two Truths

【Lower section of right page】
The commentary says: The reason this chapter appears is that the above observation-emptiness teaching clarifies that true wisdom and skillful means are all empty and non-dual, and one can understand that protecting causes and protecting effects are ultimately without difference. Arising like illusion to transform sentient beings, transformation does not arise in isolation—there must be realms of objects to be observed and teachings. What are these realms of objects and teachings? The so-called two truths. The two truths are ultimate and conventional. Being not-one, they are called "two"; being not-false, they are called "truths." Hence "Chapter on Two Truths."

Also said: Within this one chapter there are three rounds of questions and answers, discussing and analyzing the non-duality of two truths, forming three sections. The first question-answer correctly analyzes the non-duality of two truths, the second question-answer clarifies the non-duality of dharma-teaching, and the third question-answer analyzes the non-duality of dharma-gates. Within the preceding question-answer there are two parts: first question, then answer. Within the question there are three parts: first question, second difficulty, third concluding the question.

At that time King Prasenajit addressed the Buddha: "In ultimate truth, is there conventional truth? If you say there is not, wisdom should not correspond to two. If you say there is, wisdom should not correspond to one. Regarding the meaning of one and two, how is this matter?"
The commentary says: This correctly analyzes the existence or non-existence of two truths. The text "In ultimate truth is there conventional truth?" is precisely the question. "If you say there is not, wisdom does not correspond to two" refers to skillful means wisdom and true wisdom. "If you say there is" means sage wisdom does not correspond to one. If discussing the principle, it is neither one nor two. If definitively established as two, ordinary beings seeing the conventional should accordingly see the ultimate. If definitively established as existing, wisdom does not correspond to one. This is precisely the difficulty. "The meaning of one and two—how is this matter?" This precisely concludes the question.

The Buddha told the Great King: "You have already asked about one-meaning and two-meaning before the seven past buddhas." The commentary says: From "Buddha told" below, the second section where Buddha answers. Within the answer there are three parts: first, prose praising the question, second, citing the verses of seven buddhas as

proof, third, from "Great King" below, prose correctly responding to the difficulty. The initial prose praising the question has three parts: first praising the question, second briefly indicating the doctrinal essence, third admonishment. Initially praising the question reveals the king's original practices and vows—having already discussed one-two meaning in the past, why ask about this matter again now?

"You now have no listening, I now have no speaking. No-listening, no-speaking is precisely one-meaning, two-meaning." The commentary says: From "You now" below, the second briefly indicates the doctrinal essence. "You now have no listening, I now have no speaking"—the speaker is like illusion without anything spoken, why need your listening? Hence saying "no listening." The listener is like an illusory person without anything heard, why need my speaking? Thus being no-listening, no-speaking, yet not preventing listening and speaking from being manifestly present. The meaning of one-two is also thus. Hence the Vimalakīrti says: "One who teaches dharma has no teaching; one who listens to dharma has no hearing." If the mind retains listening and speaking, this is precisely dualistic view. How could this correspond with this sūtra?

"Listen carefully, listen carefully, think well upon this. Practice according to dharma. The verses of seven buddhas are thus." The commentary says: From "listen carefully, listen carefully" below, the third section of admonishment regarding contemplative practice. Only by practicing according to the three wisdoms can one penetrate and understand the meaning of one-two. "Listen carefully, listen carefully" is precisely hearing-wisdom. "Think well upon this" is precisely thinking-wisdom. "Practice according to dharma" is precisely cultivation-wisdom. Consider this. The commentary says: The second section citing seven buddhas' verses has eight and a half lines, divided into four sections. The first three verses use causal-conditional emptiness and existence to clarify the non-duality of two truths. The second has three lines using emotional understanding and enlightened seeing of one-two to clarify the non-duality of two truths. The third has two lines using analogies to clarify the non-duality of two truths. The fourth half-line concludes with encouragement directed to people. The first three verses form three sections. The first verse establishes the chapter-gates of causal-conditional emptiness-existence two truths, the next verse provides explanation, the third

verse concludes. The first verse's upper half uses existence-emptiness to clarify ultimate truth, the lower half verse uses emptiness-existence to clarify conventional truth.

"Signless ultimate meaning." The commentary says: Signless ultimate meaning—this analyzes ultimate truth. Signless means that true-reality principle transcends existence and non-existence, called signless; being unmeasurable is called ultimate meaning.

"Without self, without other-created." The commentary says: Without self, without other-created—fundamentally signless. How could it be presently without? Having said fundamentally signless, how could there suddenly be creation? Hence saying "without self, without other-created." Consider the four non-productions.

"Causal conditions fundamentally self-existent / Without self, without other-created." The commentary says: Causal conditions fundamentally self-existent clarifies that causal-conditional emptiness-existence is conventional truth. Causal conditions are fundamentally self-existent—how could they be presently existent? Having said fundamentally existent, hence saying "without self, without other-created." Consider this.

"Dharma-nature fundamentally without nature." The commentary says: From "dharma-nature" below, one verse becomes two. The upper half explains the preceding upper half, the lower half explains the preceding lower half. Dharma-nature fundamentally without nature is precisely the preceding signless ultimate meaning. All dharmas' true reality is called dharma-nature. Nature takes no-nature as dharma-nature. This speaks of no-nature in relation to nature. If there is no having nature, then also no no-nature.

"Ultimate meaning emptiness-suchness." The commentary says: Ultimate meaning emptiness-suchness is precisely ultimate meaning emptiness. Because of no-dependence and no-attainment, it is called emptiness-suchness.

"All existence fundamentally existent dharmas / Three conventionals, collectively conventional existence." The commentary says: All existence fundamentally existent dharmas—this explains

This explains the preceding "causal conditions fundamentally self-existent." "Three conventionals, collectively conventional existence" clarifies that having no substance and depending on others (the meaning of relational conventionality), they therefore exist.

"No-no truth truly without / Nirvana ultimate emptiness / All dharmas causally conditioned exist / Existence-nonexistence meaning thus." The commentary says: In the third verse, "no-no truth truly without" returns to conclude the preceding "signless ultimate meaning." "Nirvana ultimate emptiness" concludes "without self, without other-created." "All dharmas causally conditioned exist" concludes the preceding "causal conditions fundamentally self-existent." "Existence-nonexistence meaning thus" generally concludes the preceding eleven phrases. "Existence" concludes the lower halves of the preceding three verses clarifying existence; "nonexistence" concludes the upper halves of the preceding three verses clarifying nonexistence. Hence saying "existence-nonexistence meaning thus." Another explanation: "no-no truth truly without" means two negations remove two realities, hence saying "no-no truth truly without." "Nirvana ultimate emptiness" means since the self-nature of existence is fundamentally absent, it's called "nirvana ultimate emptiness." All conditioned dharmas arise dependent on six causes and four conditions, hence saying "all dharmas causally conditioned exist." Another interpretation: "no-no truth truly without" means one negation removes the above various existences, one negation removes the above nonexistence, hence saying "no-no." "Truth truly without" means wisdom illuminates true-suchness wisdom, hence saying "truth truly without." "Nirvana ultimate emptiness" means among nirvana dharmas the most refined, transcending the four propositions and departing from a hundred negations, not identical with the śrāvakas' annihilation-emptiness, hence saying "ultimate emptiness." "All dharmas causally conditioned exist, existence-nonexistence meaning thus" generally concludes the above. Another interpretation: "no-no" means one negation negates conventional truth, one negation negates ultimate truth.

"Existence-nonexistence fundamentally self-dual (ordinary view) / Like an ox's two horns / Illuminating understanding (sage view) sees non-dual." The commentary says: From "existence-nonexistence fundamentally self-dual" below, the second section has three verses. Using oneness-difference and emotional understanding to

analyze the non-duality of two truths. The first verse briefly clarifies one-two, the second verse explains, the third verse concludes with praise. The first verse becomes two parts. The upper half uses dualistic emotions to clarify two truths; the lower half uses contemplative understanding to clarify non-duality. In the upper half, the first line is dharma-explanation, the next line is analogy-explanation. "Existence-nonexistence fundamentally self-dual" means existence is not nonexistence and nonexistence is not existence, hence saying "fundamentally self-dual." How can one know existence-nonexistence? The lower line says "like an ox's two horns"—the horns having different characteristics resembles existence-nonexistence meanings not being mutually identical. Having the same one head resembles existence-nonexistence having one essence. From "illuminating understanding sees non-dual" below discusses contemplative understanding. Through buddhas' and bodhisattvas' inner penetrating illumination, all dharmas are ultimately pure. When has duality-non-duality ever taken duality as essence? Hence saying "illuminating understanding sees non-dual." Some people say "seeing non-dual" means precisely one, but this is the view of oneness-difference. How could this be illuminating understanding?

"Two truths constantly not identical." The commentary says: Two truths constantly not identical—this returns to dualistic emotions, hence saying "not identical."

"Understanding mind sees non-dual." The commentary says: Understanding mind sees non-dual explains the preceding verse's upper line. Previously, immediately seeing existence-nonexistence in conditions; now analyzing awakening. This duality of existence-nonexistence, in understanding, is immediately non-dual.

"Seeking duality is unattainable." The commentary says: Seeking duality is unattainable explains the second line's analogical explanation. Only through delusion is duality taught. Analogizing to two horns, transforming delusion into understanding. This duality is original duality; seeking duality ultimately has nothing to follow. Hence saying "unattainable."

"Not saying two truths are one." The commentary says: Not saying two truths are one explains the preceding lower half's first line "illuminating understanding sees non-dual." Originally speaking of non-duality in opposition to duality. Since that duality is already absent, how could one maintain oneness? Hence saying "not saying

two truths are one." Using this to infer non-duality, how could it return to being identical with the view of oneness?

"Non-duality, how attainable?" The commentary says: Non-duality, how attainable—if oneness is already unattainable, how much more duality?

"In understanding, constantly self-one." The commentary says: In understanding, constantly self-one concludes the preceding "understanding mind sees non-dual." This oneness speaks of one in opposition to duality. Do not make a one-understanding.

"In truth, constantly self-dual." The commentary says: In truth, constantly self-dual concludes the preceding "existence-nonexistence fundamentally self-dual." Another interpretation: "In understanding, constantly self-one" means the two truths' essence is one. "In truth, constantly self-dual" concludes that their meanings differ.

"Penetrating this non-duality / Truly entering ultimate meaning." The commentary says: Penetrating this non-duality—the lower half praises benefits. It clarifies that inner and outer merge in profound unity, existence-nonexistence are doubly quiescent, without dependence, without virtue, equal and pure. Hence saying "penetrating this non-duality, truly entering ultimate meaning."

"Conventional truth arises as magical transformation / Like flowers in empty space." The commentary says: From "conventional truth arises as magical transformation" below, the third section has two verses. Using analogies to clarify two truths, making two parts. The first one and a half lines clarify that conventional truth's persons and dharmas are identical to magical transformation; from "magician" below, half a line uses analogy to clarify ultimate truth. "Conventional truth arises as magical transformation, like flowers in empty space" clarifies that conventional truth is falsely deceptive and unreal, just like empty flowers, only deceiving the flesh eye, falsely seen as existent. Consider this.

"Like shadows, three hands absent / Due to causes and conditions, deceptively existent." The commentary says: Like shadows, three hands absent, due to causes and conditions, deceptively existent—this means having no causes and conditions, only having false conventional names without their reality.

"Magical transformation sees magical transformation." The commentary says: Magical transformation sees magical transformation means sentient beings' essence is that illusion, and being further stained by illusory dust is called "magical transformation sees magical transformation."

"Sentient beings called illusory truth." The commentary says: Sentient beings called illusory truth—above in conventional truth clarifying dharma-illusion, now clarifying person-transformation.

"Magician sees magical dharmas." The commentary says: Magician sees magical dharmas—the lower half clarifies ultimate truth. Buddhas and bodhisattvas are compared to magicians; the three realms' falsity is magical dharma.

"In true reality, all are without." The commentary says: In true reality, all are without—through delusion one sees existence. Reversing delusion with true illumination, one knows all are without. Speaking of nonexistence in opposition to existence; when existence ceases, nonexistence also disappears. Conditional observation are both quiescent.

"Called buddhas' contemplation / Bodhisattvas' contemplation also thus." The commentary says: From "called buddhas' contemplation" below, the fourth half-verse raises contemplation to conclude with attribution to persons. The first line, regarding fruition persons knowing two truths, says "called buddhas' contemplation." The second line, regarding causal persons knowing two truths, says "bodhisattvas' contemplation also thus."

"Great King." The commentary says: From "Great King" below, the third section correctly explains the difficulty to clarify the non-duality of two truths. Within this there are three parts. First, raising fruition in opposition to causation to clarify the non-duality of two truths. Second, from "five eyes" below, focusing exclusively on fruition to explain non-duality. Third, from "bodhisattvas not yet buddhas" below, doubly concluding causation and fruition to explain non-duality. Within the first section of raising fruition in opposition to causation, there are two parts. First, regarding bodhisattvas' transformative vision about non-duality, illuminating ordinary beings' two-fold seen two truths. From "Buddha and" below, the second extensively clarifies that the transformed sentient beings and dharmas are all non-dual.

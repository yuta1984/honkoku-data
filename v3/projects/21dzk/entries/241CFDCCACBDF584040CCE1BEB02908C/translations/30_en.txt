Immediately generating the unsurpassed bodhi mind. The commentary says: The fifth is making the contemplation of fourteen faculties. The five sense faculties, five object faculties, male, female, mind, and life. These fourteen are the root of birth and death. Therefore the Satyasiddhi Śāstra calls them "the faculties of coming and going." Because of the faults and sufferings of birth and death, bodhisattvas must first contemplate them. It also says: The sixth, generating the bodhi mind, refers to the five types of bodhi mentioned in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra; this is the fifth, the unsurpassed bodhi mind. Among the four types of bodhi in the Nirvana Sutra, this generates the fourth, supreme contemplation bodhi. Among the three types of bodhi in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra, this is the third, Buddha bodhi mind.

Always cultivating that all things in the three realms are impure moment by moment, thus attaining the contemplation gate of impurity patience and dwelling in the Buddha's household, cultivating the six harmonious respects: namely, harmony in the three karmas, same precepts, same views, same learning, practicing the eighty-four thousand pāramitā paths. The commentary says: The seventh, always cultivating three-realm patience, means contemplating that the three realms are all impure moment by moment. This is the root of all outflows; in one pure moment one immediately attains impurity patience. By practicing the above contemplations, one is called a Buddha's disciple. Hence it says "dwelling in the Buddha's household." The eighth, cultivating the six harmonious respects, means practicing together with beings, called "harmony." Mutually receiving virtue is called "respect." Harmonious cultivation of the three karmas makes three; same precepts, same views, same learning. Practicing eighty-four thousand degrees is called six. Other sutras make "same benefit" the sixth.

Good sons, bodhisattvas practicing the ten good deeds before the patience of practice have retreats and advances, like light feathers following the wind east and west. These bodhisattvas are likewise thus: although they practice the ten correct paths and generate the three bodhi minds for ten thousand kalpas, when they are about to enter the position of practicing patience, they also always study the three subduing patiences, but cannot be designated by name. These are indeterminate people. The commentary says: From "good sons" below, the second major section in practicing patience further explains the three

external ordinary ten good deeds before the thirty minds. Raising faults to reveal virtues. I privately say: The meaning of indeterminate advance and retreat is as usual. Consider this through dharma and analogy.

These are determinate people. Because they enter the sage nature of the position of personal emptiness, they necessarily do not commit the five heinous crimes, six grave offenses, or twenty-eight light transgressions. Creating rebellious crimes against Buddhist dharma texts and saying they are not Buddha's teachings—there is no such case. Being able to cultivate subduing path patience practices for one incalculable kalpa, they first attain entry into the saṃgata position. The commentary says: From "these are determinate people" below, the third major section in the practicing patience position reveals attainment, again concluding the practicing seed patience. The text has three parts: first, attaining the position of birth and emptiness. This person attains understanding of personal emptiness and selflessness. Also called provisional name emptiness. From "necessarily do not arise" below, second, clarifying separation from faults. The five heinous crimes are as previously explained. The six grave offenses are the four grave offenses plus not drinking alcohol as the fifth, and not speaking of the faults of the four assemblies as the sixth. The twenty-eight light transgressions appear in the Śrāvakayāna Upāsaka Sūtra. First: not making offerings to parents and teachers. Second: indulging in pleasurable drinking. Third: being unable to tend to bodily illness and suffering. Fourth: when there are those seeking food, being unable to give according to their needs and letting them depart empty-handed. Fifth: if seeing violations among the four fruits, generating pride and arrogance. Seventh: monthly being unable to maintain the six fasting days and receive the eight-limbed precepts. Eighth: having a dharma teaching place within forty li but not going to listen. Ninth: accepting bedding and seats from monastery monks. Tenth: drinking water while suspecting it contains insects. Eleventh: traveling alone through dangerous places without companions. Twelfth: staying overnight alone in a nunnery without companions. Thirteenth: beating and scolding servants, slaves, and outsiders for wealth and life. Fourteenth: offering leftover food to the four assemblies. Fifteenth: keeping cats and wild animals. Sixteenth: raising elephants, horses, cattle, donkeys, and all birds and beasts without making pure

donations. Seventeenth: not storing saṃghāṭi robes, bowls, and khakkhara staffs. Eighteenth: farming for one's own body. Nineteenth: not being allowed to engage in trade for one's body and life, selling goods with measures and scales. Once a price is stated, one cannot retreat, abandon the cheap, and take the expensive. Twentieth: engaging in desire at improper places and times. Twenty-first: in commercial trading, not paying government taxes and stealing away. Twenty-second: violating national regulations. Twenty-third: obtaining new fruits and vegetables but not first offering them to the Three Jewels, first using them oneself. Twenty-fourth: if monks dare not teach dharma and praise, presumptuous self-action. Twenty-fifth: walking in front of novices and monks. Twenty-sixth: when distributing food in the monastery, not being allowed to select and take the best, taking beyond one's portion. Twenty-seventh: not being allowed to raise silkworms. Twenty-eighth: when traveling and encountering sick people, not staying to care for them, making expedient arrangements for their care before departing. Those who create rebellious crimes against Buddhist dharma texts saying they are not Buddha's teachings: regarding true Buddha teachings in the Buddha dharma, saying they are not Buddha's teachings, and regarding what is truly not Buddha's teachings, saying they are Buddha's teachings—there is no such case. "Using one incalculable kalpa" means from the initial mind of good destinies to the fulfilled mind of the practicing seed position, altogether passing through one incalculable kalpa. "First attaining entry into the saṃgata position" is the third section concluding the practicing patience position. Foreign countries call it saṃgha, this land calls it practicing seed nature. Also translated by meaning as "ground of freedom from attachment" because one does not attach to personal self. Question: Does practicing seed nature have other names and additional designations? Answer: The Brahmajāla Sūtra clarifies there are six names. In nature it is called practicing seed nature. In firmness it is called firm faith. In patience it is called faith patience. In wisdom it is called heard wisdom. In concentration it is called practicing characteristics concentration. In contemplation it is called dwelling contemplation. I privately say: The meanings and names of the ten abodes should be considered as usual.

Furthermore, the nature seed nature practices ten wisdom contemplations, extinguishing the ten inversions and the individual false aspects of self and personal views,

having only names, only perceptions, only dharmas that cannot be grasped, without fixed characteristics, without self-other characteristics. Therefore cultivating protective emptiness contemplation, also always practicing millions of pāramitās, moment by moment not departing from mind. Using two incalculable kalpas to practice correct path dharmas, dwelling in the pāramita position. The commentary says: From "furthermore, nature seed" below clarifies the second, middle patience. The text has eight phrases: first establishing the name, second revealing practical virtues, third extinguishing delusions, fourth knowing the conventional, fifth cultivating contemplation, sixth distinguishing the amount of practice, seventh the time period of cultivation, eighth concluding the name. First, establishing the name, the text says "nature seed nature." Second, revealing practical virtues, the text says "practicing ten wisdom contemplations." The ten wisdoms are the ten stopping minds from the previous Teaching Chapter. The four mind-stoppings make four, namely the four foundations of mindfulness. The three good roots make seven, namely loving-kindness, giving, and wisdom. The three mind-stoppings make ten. The three mind-stoppings are the so-called three-time patience: past cause patience, present cause-effect patience, future effect patience. Third, extinguishing delusions, the text saying "extinguishing ten inversions": the ten inversions are the four of permanence, bliss, self, and purity corresponding to four foundations, and three affliction inversions corresponding to three foundations. Past cause patience corresponds to cause inversion, future effect patience corresponds to effect inversion, present cause-effect patience corresponds to cause-effect inversion. Or it may be as in the Mind-Generation Chapter of the Daśabhūmika Śāstra. It also says: Fourth, knowing conventional truth as provisionally existent, not real. The text says "individually false and ungraspable." Fifth, emptiness contemplation, the text says "without self-other characteristics, cultivating protective emptiness contemplation." Contemplating self and person as having no self-other characteristics. Therefore emptiness is precisely the three emptiness contemplation gates. When not complete it is called cultivation; when already attained it is called protection. Sixth, distinguishing the amount of practice, the text saying "always practicing millions of pāramitās, moment by moment not departing from mind" means through uninterrupted cultivation, not departing from mind. Seventh, the time period of cultivation, the text says "using two incalculable kalpas."

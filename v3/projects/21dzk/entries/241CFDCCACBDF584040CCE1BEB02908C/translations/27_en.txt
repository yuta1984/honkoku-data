Two lines concern heavenly dragons, the next line concerns yin and yang.

Mount Sumeru and vast seas all turn to ash and rise up; heavenly dragons' merit exhausted, they decay and perish within.
Even the two principles perish - what permanence can nations have?

The commentary says: The two principles are first yin and second yang. These two types can generate and can destroy, hence they are called the "two principles." "Even perish" clarifies that although these yin and yang again grow and flourish, they decay and perish moment by moment, therefore this is impermanence. The line below concludes with impermanence. Consider the five types of impermanence.

Birth, old age, illness, death - endless cycles of transmigration; affairs go against wishes, sorrow and grief become harm.

The commentary says: The next two verses clarify suffering, namely clarifying the eight sufferings. "Birth, etc." refers to birth suffering, old age suffering, illness suffering, death suffering. "Endless cycles of transmigration" means samsara is precisely the suffering of formations. "Affairs go against wishes" is the suffering of not obtaining what one seeks, also called the suffering of separation from what one loves. "Sorrow and grief" is precisely the suffering of resentment.

Deep desires and heavy calamities, ulcers and boils with nothing external; the three realms are all suffering - what can nations rely upon?

The commentary says: "Deep desires and heavy calamities" - a treatise says "like ocean water without borders and without bottom, able to summon heavy suffering." Hence it says "heavy calamities." "Ulcers and boils with nothing external" means greed arises from the inner mind, therefore; ulcers and boils exist in the body itself, hence it says "nothing external."

Existence is originally non-existent of itself; causes and conditions create all things; what flourishes must decline; what is real must become empty.

The commentary says: The next two verses clarify emptiness. The text saying "existence is originally non-existent of itself" clarifies that self-nature is originally empty. "Causes and conditions create all things" clarifies the emptiness of causes and conditions. Conditioned dharmas are like sky-flowers, having only provisional names

but no reality. The Correct View states: "Dharmas arising from causes and conditions are precisely emptiness." "What flourishes must decline" - this is beginning-and-end emptiness. "What is real must become empty" means sentient beings consider the self as true characteristics. When a knife cuts the body, impermanence immediately brings resentment. This is precisely "what is real must become empty." Consider this.

Sentient beings in confusion are all like illusory dwellings; sounds and echoes are both empty; nations and lands are also thus.

The commentary says: "Sentient beings in confusion are all like illusory dwellings" clarifies the emptiness of persons. "Sounds and echoes are both empty" clarifies the emptiness of characteristics. Consider this.

Consciousness-spirit has no form, provisionally riding four serpents; without eyes, nurturing and caring, taking this as a pleasure vehicle.

The commentary says: The first line concerns mind in clarifying no-self. Since mind is not form and characteristics, it says "no form." "Provisionally riding four serpents" relates to form in clarifying no-self. The four serpents are metaphors for the four great elements. "Without eyes, nurturing and caring, taking this as a pleasure vehicle" - these two lines relate to emotions in clarifying no-self. Because ordinary beings lack the eye of wisdom, they cherish and play with this body, taking it as a pleasure vehicle. Like an elephant without eyes merely seeking taste and flavor, they delight in the vehicle of the five aggregates. Not understanding no-self, they nurture and care for the four great elements, claiming there is a self. They don't know this body exists through provisional combination, similar to many pieces of wood forming a cart. They mistakenly calculate light suffering, calling this pleasure, naming it a "pleasure vehicle."

Form has no permanent master; spirit has no permanent home; form and spirit still separate - how can there be nations?

The commentary says: Form refers to the four great elements. Spirit refers to consciousness-spirit. "Form and spirit still separate" properly clarifies no-self. "How can there be nations?" raises analogies to reveal the emptiness of nations.

At that time, after the dharma teacher explained these verses, King Universal Brightness's retinue attained the dharma-eye of emptiness, and the king himself realized

the samādhi equal to space. The commentary says: The third, hearing dharma and attaining understanding, has two parts: first clarifying self-understanding, then clarifying teaching others. Self-practice has two parts: first, retinue attains understanding; second, King Universal Brightness himself realizes the samādhi equal to space.

Hearing dharma and attaining understanding, [he] returned to the place of King Spotted Foot of Tianluò nation. I privately note: The commentary explanation is lacking. This simply means Prince Spotted Foot heard the above verses and returned to his original place.

In the assembly, he immediately announced to the nine hundred ninety-nine kings: "The time of accepting fate has arrived. Each person should chant the verse passages from the Sutra on Prajñāpāramitā Asked by the Benevolent Kings of the Past Seven Buddhas." The commentary says: Next clarifying teaching others has five parts. "Immediately announcing to the nine hundred" below clarifies transforming the other kings. The textual meaning is clear. Consider this.

At that time King Spotted Foot asked the various kings: "What dharma do you all chant?" At that time King Universal Brightness immediately answered the king with the above verses. The king heard this dharma and attained the samādhi of emptiness. The nine hundred ninety-nine kings also heard the dharma and all realized the samādhi of the three gates of emptiness. The commentary says: From "At that time King Spotted Foot asked the various kings" below, the second clarifies that Spotted Foot and the various kings together heard dharma and obtained benefit.

At that time King Spotted Foot was extremely joyful and announced to the various kings: "I was misled by heretical teachers. This is not the fault of you lords. You should return to your home countries, each invite dharma teachers to lecture and explain the words, meanings, and phrases of prajñāpāramitā." The commentary says: From "announcing to the various kings" below, clarifying that all kings were released to each return to their home countries and all propagate this sutra.

At that time King Spotted Foot entrusted his nation to his younger brother, left home to pursue the path, and realized the patience of non-arising dharmas, as explained in the Ten Kings' Stages

Sutra. The commentary says: From "entrusting the nation to his younger brother" below, the fourth clarifies Spotted Foot's leaving home, advancing in practice, and attaining the patience of non-arising.

Five thousand kings constantly chanted this sutra and received retribution in this present life. The commentary says: From "five thousand" below, the fifth clarifies the benefits obtained by the five thousand kings.

Great King, the sixteen great nation kings cultivate the dharma of protecting nations. The dharma should be thus. You should accept and maintain it. The commentary says: From "Great King, the sixteen great nations" below, the third major section of the chapter on encouraging maintenance has three parts: first encouraging the sixteen nation kings to accept and maintain.

All sentient beings in heaven, among humans, and in the six realms should take up and maintain the words, meanings, and phrases of the seven Buddhas. The commentary says: Second, from "in heaven and among humans" below, encouraging sentient beings of the six realms to accept and maintain.

In future ages there will again be immeasurable small nation kings wanting to protect their territories - they too should invite dharma teachers to explain the words, meanings, and phrases of the Prajñāpāramitā Sutra. The commentary says: Third, from "immeasurable small nation kings" below, encouraging various small nation kings to take up and maintain. The third section on encouraging maintenance is completed.

At that time, when Śākyamuni Buddha explained this prajñāpāramitā, five hundred million people in the assembly attained entry to the first stage. The commentary says: From "At that time Śākyamuni" below, the fourth major section of the chapter clarifies the benefits obtained. There are six different types of benefits obtained. First, five hundred million people attained the first stage.

Again, there were eighty thousand sons of the gods of the six desire [realms] who attained the stage of nature-emptiness. The commentary says: Second, eighty thousand from the six desire heavens attained the stage of nature-emptiness, which is at the fourth stage and above.

Great Tranquility Unconditioned Vajra Treasury　　All recompense exhausted, limitless compassion
Ultimate meaning truth constantly peaceful　　Exhausting source, completing nature, wondrous wisdom remains

From "Perfect Wisdom Formless" below, three lines explain the buddha-ground upper forbearance, divided into six parts. "Perfect wisdom" means when realms are exhausted and wisdom has no [object], it's called perfect wisdom—this is precisely omniscient wisdom. "Three-realm king" means the supreme dharma king. Beyond the thirteen kings, Buddha is the dharma-wheel king. "Thirty births exhausted" means each of the ten grounds' three births are completed. Because causes are perfected and fruits matured, it says "equal to great awakening." "Great tranquility unconditioned" is precisely upper forbearance. Saying "vajra" means the vajra without delusion. Saying "all recompense exhausted" means both fragmented and transformational [recompense] are exhausted. Saying "limitless compassion" clarifies its benevolent virtue—this is precisely unconditioned great compassion. "Ultimate meaning truth constantly peaceful"—among nirvana buddha-nature principles, being most refined, it's called "ultimate." Having deep significance, it's called "meaning." Because knowing the non-dual characteristics of all dharmas, it says "constantly peaceful." "Exhausting source, completing nature"—causes being exhausted is called "exhausting source," seeing the end is called "completing nature." Because seed-wisdom constantly condenses, it's called "wondrous wisdom remains."

Three worthies, ten sages dwell in recompense　　Only Buddha alone resides in pure land
All sentient beings temporarily dwell in recompense　　Ascending vajra source, dwelling in pure land

From "Three worthies, ten sages" below, eight lines generally conclude the five forbearances, having three sections. The first two lines clarify pure land benefiting beings. The first sentence saying "Three worthies, ten sages dwell in recompense" means dwelling in fragmented transformational recompense lands. Also, the three worthies dwell in fragmented co-dwelling recompense lands; the ten sages dwell in actual recompense unobstructed recompense lands. The second sentence saying "only Buddha" means Buddha alone dwelling in constant tranquil light land is called "temporarily dwelling in recompense."

Tathagata's three karmas, virtue limitless　　　I, Moon Light, now bow to the Three Jewels

This one line praises three-karma merit. The upper half is speech karma, the lower half is body karma. Consider this well.

Dharma King supreme, tree among humans　　　Covering and sheltering the great assembly, immeasurable light
Constantly speaking dharma with the mouth, not meaningless　　Mind-wisdom extinction-tranquil, unconditioned illumination
Lion among humans speaking for the multitude　　　Great assembly rejoicing, scattering golden flowers
Hundred billion myriad lands, six great shakings　　　Sentient beings receiving wondrous recompense
Heavenly Honored One joyfully explaining fourteen kings　　　Therefore I now briefly praise Buddha

From "Dharma King supreme" below, five lines praise three-karma benefits. "Dharma King supreme, tree among humans" clarifies body-light benefiting beings. The Tathagata, supreme dharma king, rules over the great thousand [worlds], providing shade for all like worldly trees, hence saying "covering and sheltering the great assembly." The first sentence of the second line praises oral explanation. The Tathagata explains permanent-impermanent all dharmas, all having deep significance, hence saying "not meaningless." The lower sentence praises mental karma tranquility. The Tathagata's great tranquil samādhi illuminates without conditioning, severing causal conditions, hence saying "unconditioned illumination." The third line clarifies lion's roar teaching removing doubt, making sentient beings rejoice. The fourth line: body supernatural powers' six shakings enabling sentient beings to attain fruition. The fifth line concludes the praise. "Heavenly Honored One joyfully explaining"—because Buddha emerges above worldly humans and gods, it says "Heavenly Honored One joyfully explaining." Fourteen kings means habit-seed copper wheel, nature-seed silver wheel, path-seed golden wheel kings. Ten as ten immediately combine to make thirteen. Buddha as three-realm king, combined with the previous thirteen, makes fourteen king-grounds. "Therefore I now briefly praise"—Moon Light's self-modesty; because his wisdom-light is slight and cannot extensively praise Tathagata wisdom, he says "briefly praise Buddha."

At that time, the great assembly heard Moon Light King praising the fourteen kings' immeasurable merit treasury and gained great dharma benefit. Immediately in the assembly there were ten Ganges sand heavenly kings, ten Ganges sand Brahma kings, ten Ganges sand ghost-spirit kings up to the three destinies who attained no-arising dharma forbearance. The eight divisions of asura kings presently transformed their ghost bodies, received the path in heaven, and those entering correct position in three births, or four births, five births up to ten births attaining entry to correct position, realized sage nature and attained all immeasurable fruition recompense.

From "At that time, the great assembly" below clarifies the great assembly hearing dharma and gaining benefit. The prose has three sections. First clarifying various gods and humans gaining benefit. From "up to" below, the three destinies obtain profit. From "three births" below: the extension and brevity of attaining the path. First clarifying heavenly kings attaining no-arising forbearance. Specifically speaking, seventh ground and above is called no-arising forbearance; generally speaking, first ground and above is called no-arising forbearance. The three destinies attaining no-arising means no-arising pervades upper and lower. Three destinies means human-heaven-spirit three destinies. Eight divisions means below the four heavenly kings' dwelling are four asura kings: first Rāhu asura king, second Vimalacitra asura king, third Bali asura king, fourth Virūḍhaka asura king. Below Mount Sumeru there are additionally four great asuras: first Terror, second Puṣkara, third Bāraha, fourth Śambara. Correct position has two meanings: first, person-emptiness correct position—tenth understanding and above attain person-emptiness; second, dharma-emptiness correct position—first ground and above attain no-arising correct position.

Buddha told the assembly of actual heavenly beings who had attained the path fruition: "Good sons, this Moon Light King already in the past, in the dharma of Dragon Light King Buddha ten thousand kalpas ago, was a fourth-abode enlightened being, and I was an eighth-abode bodhisattva. Now before me making great lion's roar—thus it is, thus it is. As you understand, attaining true meaning, explaining the inconceivable, immeasurable. Only Buddha with Buddha can know this matter."

From "Buddha told" below praises Moon Light's long service to many Buddhas, having five sections. First revealing Moon Light's fundamental traces. From "as you" below, second brief narration. Third, from "Good son" to "attaining no-mind" is extensive narration. Fourth, from "therefore prajñā merit" to "inconceivable" praises prajñā forgetting words and separating from attachment like wind moving through space. Fifth, from "Good son, this merit treasury" to "merit" compares the superiority and inferiority of Moon Light's explanations with the thirteen dharma masters' explanations. In the first: initially addressing the assembly of worthies and sages who attained the path in heaven. Second, from "Good son" below reveals Moon Light's traces. Fourth abode is the fourth Blazing Ground; eighth abode is precisely the eighth Immovable Ground. Lion's roar praises the teaching being definitive ultimate meaning explanation.

In the second brief narration: first narrating Moon Light's explanations, second citing Buddha's verification. "Thus it is, thus it is" are words of approval. "As you understand" praises his meaning. "Inconceivable" is another name for no-attainment correct contemplation. "Immeasurable" means not the realm of two-vehicle lower positions. "Only Buddha with Buddha" is the second citing Buddha to verify Moon Light's explanations.

"Good son, what he explained—fourteen prajñāpāramitās, three forbearance grounds, upper-middle-lower of each ground, thirty forbearances, all practice treasury, all buddha treasury—is inconceivable."

From "Good son" below, in the extensive narration there are four parts. First briefly narrating the fourteen forbearances. From "Why?" below extensively narrating the fourteen forbearances' functions. Third, all sentient...

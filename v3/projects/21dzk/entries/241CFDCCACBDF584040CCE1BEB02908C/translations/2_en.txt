She reunited his body and nursed him with her milk. As years passed and he grew up, he possessed great power and force. He was able to swallow and conquer all nations. He captured eighty-four thousand kings, placed them within five mountains, established a city and ruled there. Because it was where many kings dwelled, it is called Rājagṛha (King's Residence City). Consider this.

Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain: Rājagṛha has six monasteries: 1) Veṇuvana Monastery, 2) Balaśakti Solitary Mountain Monastery, 3) Saptaparṇa Cave Mountain Monastery, 4) Devarāja Cave Mountain Monastery, 5) Sarpa Cave Monastery, 6) Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain Monastery. This is translated as Vulture Peak Mountain. Gṛdhra means "vulture" and kūṭa means "peak." The summit of this mountain resembles a vulture, hence it is called thus. Also, south of Rājagṛha there are many charnel grounds where birds and beasts come to feed. Vultures gather there, hence it is called Vulture Peak Mountain. The five mountains are: in the east, Elephant Head; in the south, Horse Head; in the west, Sheep Head; in the north, Lion Head; and in the center, Vulture Head.

With the Great Bhikṣu Assembly: Below lists the co-hearing assembly. Consider the matter of four types of assemblies. Among these are twelve great assemblies. Among the twelve, the first ten assemblies are assemblies of this land, the eleventh is an assembly from other directions, and the twelfth is a transformation assembly. The order of listing the co-hearing assembly: First, the matter of listing śrāvakas. From small to great, listing upāsikās; from great, listing bodhisattvas. Now understand why śrāvakas are mentioned first. Within the Buddha-dharma there are two types of paths: one is the manifest path. Using the manifest path, śrāvakas are listed first - consider this. Also, since bodhisattvas have no fixed form, perhaps they are not mentioned first due to fear of worldly people's doubts. Within the śrāvakas there are five sections: 1) raising names, 2) listing numbers, 3) presenting positions, 4) praising virtues, 5) general conclusion. The following follows this pattern. "Great" means supreme and also means many. The Wisdom Treatise presents five meanings of bhikṣu: 1) almsman, 2) destroyer of afflictions,

【Right page, lower section】
3) nominal bhikṣu, 4) ordained bhikṣu, 5) terror to demons. The commentary states: "Almsman" means pure livelihood, as explained in Śāriputra's causal conditions. "Destroyer of evil": "bhi" means evil, "kṣu" means able. Because one is able to destroy evil, one is called bhikṣu. One who receives ordination is called bhikṣu. "Nominal bhikṣu": Just as barbarian, Chinese, and foreign places each have their designations, hence called bhikṣu. "Bhi" means able, "kṣu" means fear. Because one can frighten demon armies, one is called bhikṣu.

Eight hundred million: Listing numbers. Consider the three meanings of "million," etc.

Learners: Below reveals positions. "Learners" are those in training (śaikṣa). "Non-learners" (退法思法護法安住法堪達法不動法) are arhats.

All Arhats: There are three meanings. Arhat means "worthy of offerings." Araha means "no-birth." Arghana means "slayer of thieves." In reality, these are interconnected - consider this.

Conditioned Merits: Praising virtues. Conditioned refers to wisdom-virtue, the Truth of the Path. Bestowing effort is called merit (gong), returning to oneself is called virtue (de), hence called merit-virtue.

Unconditioned Skillful Virtue: Cessation-virtue, the Truth of Cessation.

Ten Wisdoms of Non-learners: Four Truths, dharma-wisdom, inferential wisdom, conventional wisdom, mind-reading wisdom, exhaustion wisdom, and non-arising wisdom - only the fourth fruit possesses all these.

Eight Wisdoms of Learners: Anāgāmins exclude exhaustion and non-arising wisdoms but possess eight wisdoms.

Six Wisdoms of Learners: Srotāpannas (預流. Srotāpanna was formerly called "against the stream" - because they go against the stream of birth-and-death suffering) and Sakṛdāgāmins (一來) exclude exhaustion and non-arising wisdoms.

【Left page, upper section】
They also exclude mind-reading wisdom because they have not attained fundamental dhyāna, and exclude conventional wisdom because it was previously possessed, not newly attained. Alternatively, srotāpannas may possess six wisdoms, excluding conventional wisdom because it is not the wisdom by which srotāpanna persons sever bonds.

Three Faculties: The commentary states: 1) The faculty of "will-know" is in the path of seeing because one has not yet made repeated decisive judgments. 2) The faculty of "already-known" is in the path of cultivation because one makes repeated decisive judgments. 3) The faculty of "knowing-complete" is in the path of no-more-learning because one no longer seeks superior wisdom. This should be thoroughly studied.

Sixteen Mental Activities: The sixteen minds refer to the sixteen minds of the Four Truths: suffering dharma-wisdom patience, etc. The sixteen activities refer to the sixteen aspects of the Four Truths: suffering, emptiness, impermanence, no-self, etc. - consider this.

Dharma-provisional Emptiness-Reality Contemplation, Reception-provisional Emptiness-Reality Contemplation, Name-provisional Emptiness-Reality Contemplation: Dharmas such as the five aggregates are called "dharma-provisional." The five aggregates forming sentient beings is called "reception-provisional." Taking the names above these two provisionals is called "name-provisional." The mutual comparison of emptiness and reality has multiple layers. Namely, dharma-provisional is real, while the two provisionals are empty. Hence it becomes emptiness-reality contemplation through mutual comparison - consider this. The Tripiṭaka master uses dharma, reception, and names (possibly missing characters, see Volume 1 of the Treasury Commentary) Perfect dependence on the three natures (possibly missing characters): true-nature, other-dependent nature, discriminated nature - consider this.

Three Emptiness Contemplation Gates: The three emptinesses refer to the three liberation gates: emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness. One interpretation points to the emptiness of the three provisionals.

Four Truths and Twelve (possibly missing "conditions" character according to Treasury Commentary) Conditions - Immeasurable Merits All Accomplished: Consider the meanings of Four Truths, Twelve Conditions, etc.

Again there are eight hundred million great sage pratyekabuddhas (listing numbers). Second, raising pratyekabuddhas. The five sections follow the previous pattern.

Great Sage Pratyekabudddha: In past causes, he was a king who took court ladies into a garden for recreation. After briefly sleeping, while not yet fully asleep, the trees were exquisite and their colors luxuriant. Suddenly the court ladies became decayed and ruined. The king immediately contemplated: "Before long, I too shall become like this." Using the external to understand the internal, he immediately became a great pratyekabuddha. Hence called Great Sage Pratyekabuddha. Second, they appear in the world after Buddha's departure and awaken alone - consider this.

Neither断 Nor Eternal: Praising virtues. Two past causes producing five present effects is "not断." Three present causes entering the future is "not eternal." Also, arising from conditions is "not断"; being born and then perishing is "not eternal." Also, if causal conditions continue there is "not断"; since dharmas have no inherent nature, "not eternal."

Four Truths and Twelve Conditions All Accomplished: General conclusion - consider this. Pratyekabuddhas are self-awakened without teachers. How then are they listed among the co-hearing assembly? It means they awakened to conditions while dwelling in the snowy mountains, heard the Tathāgata's emission of light and earth-shaking, followed the light and came. Therefore Ānanda listed them among the co-hearing assembly.

Again there are nine hundred million bodhisattva-mahāsattvas: Third, raising bodhisattva-mahāsattvas. Translated as "great-aspiration sentient beings." It should be called mahābodhisattva. This means "great-aspiration sentient beings." By meaning and interpretation it is called "revelation" (possibly "scholar" according to Treasury Commentary) because they use the Way to open beings. Also called "Way-persons" because they are accomplished by the Way.

All Arhats: When the three meanings are complete, they are called arhats.

Real Wisdom Merit and Skillful Means Wisdom Merit: As follows, these are the two wisdoms of fundamental and post-attainment.

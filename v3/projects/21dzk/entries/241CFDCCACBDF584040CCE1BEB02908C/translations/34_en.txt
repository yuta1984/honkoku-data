Having already contemplated both emptiness and existence together, with transformative practice corresponding to the Buddha, therefore called "great minister." As the sutra says, "Śāriputra is the great general of the Buddha-dharma." Fifth, advancement saying "practicing ten powers dharma for a thousand incalculable kalpas." The ten powers are as explained separately. "Mind and mental factors corresponding, constantly entering seeing-Buddha samādhi" means: because attaining no-attainment understanding, called "corresponding." "Constantly entering seeing-Buddha samādhi" means certifying Buddha-mindfulness samādhi.

Furthermore, Wisdom-Light Divine Transformation dwells in supreme non-arising patience, extinguishing the characteristics of mind and mental factors. With dharma-eye seeing all phenomena, with three eyes seeing form and emptiness. Through great vow-power constantly being born in all pure lands, gathering immeasurable Buddha-light samādhis for myriad incalculable kalpas, thus able to manifest the divine powers of hundreds of millions of Ganges-sand Buddhas, dwelling in bhagavat position, also constantly entering Buddha-flower samādhi. The commentary says: From Wisdom-Light below clarifies the ninth ground, with seven sections: first, establishing ground name; second, explaining patience; third, extinguishing delusions; fourth, clarifying the illuminating function of four eyes; fifth, vow-power rebirth; sixth, advancement time; seventh, concluding position. First, establishing the name "Wisdom-Light"—namely Good Wisdom Ground. Wisdom is prajñā, light is dharma-body, divine transformation is liberation. Second, explaining patience saying "dwelling in supreme non-arising patience"—the superior grade within non-arising patience. Comparing with the eighth ground's middle grade, advancing beyond the lower grade. Therefore this ninth ground is called "dwelling in supreme non-arising patience." Third, extinguishing delusions saying "extinguishing characteristics of mind and mental factors"—this is precisely the ignorance at the edge of mind. Fourth, clarifying the different illuminating functions of four eyes. "Dharma-eye seeing all phenomena" clarifies dharma-eye's illumination of existence. This is path-species wisdom. Simply being able to condition existence and liberate sentient beings is called "dharma-eye seeing all phenomena." "Three eyes seeing form and emptiness"—the three eyes are physical, divine, and wisdom. The physical and divine two eyes see coarse and subtle forms, wisdom-eye sees emptiness. The three eyes function together, therefore called "three eyes

seeing form and emptiness." Fifth, vow-power saying "through vow-power being born in pure lands" means using no-attainment vows to transform and benefit sentient beings. From "thus able to manifest" below clarifies arising divine powers to benefit beings. Seventh, concluding position. "Dwelling in bhagavat position" translates as "World-Honored One." Also called "Ground of Breaking Purity." Bhaga means breaking, van means pure ground. Saying "Buddha-flower samādhi" is precisely śūraṅgama concentration.

Furthermore, Buddha-Contemplation Bodhisattva dwells in extinction patience. From initial arousal of aspiration until now, passing through millions of incalculable kalpas, cultivating millions of incalculable kalpas of merit, therefore ascending to liberation of all phenomena, dwelling on the vajra platform. The commentary says: From Buddha-Contemplation below clarifies the tenth ground. The text has three sections: first clarifying capabilities within the ground; from "Good son" below, second, comparing to show superiority, manifesting the boundaries of practice, distinguishing cause as different from fruition, also called "the difference between seeing nature and not seeing nature"; from "constantly cultivating all" below, third, concluding the position of contemplative entry. Regarding the first, clarifying capabilities within the ground has four parts. First, "Buddha-Contemplation" is the name of Dharma-Cloud Ground. Second, "dwelling in extinction patience" establishes the patience name. This tenth ground together with Buddha dwells in the same patience, combined as the thirteenth dharma-master. Saying "dwelling in extinction patience"—if considering its particular aspect, only taking the tenth ground's lower-grade extinction patience. If considering its general aspect, generally clarifying that both Buddha and bodhisattvas are all called "extinction patience." Third, clarifying the cultivation time period within the ground. The text saying "passing through millions, etc." clarifies the long duration of cultivation practice. Following the previous pattern, should say "thirteen incalculable." "Merits of millions of incalculable kalpas" clarifies the vastness and multiplicity of practices arising in the ground. Fourth, manifesting the supreme height of positional boundaries. The text saying "ascending to liberation of all phenomena, dwelling on vajra platform"—the tenth ground is the vajra platform. It's also possible this sentence raises fruition to reveal causation.

Good son, from learning patience to summit samādhi, all are called subduing all afflictions. The commentary says: From learning patience to anointing, all called subduing—from learning patience to vajra, before eliminating the one thought of original grade, one moment of delusion remains generally present. Speaking of this, therefore called subduing. Also saying: using cause in relation to fruition, mind internally carries delusion, not permanently absent, therefore called subduing.

Yet signless faith extinguishes all afflictions, generates liberation wisdom, illuminates ultimate truth, yet not called seeing. What is called seeing is omniscience. Therefore I have constantly taught from ancient times: "Only Buddha has knowledge, vision, and awareness." The commentary says: "Yet signless faith extinguishing all"—from first ground to third ground faith-patience position also illuminates ultimate truth. "Not called seeing" means seeing nature is not yet clear. Another explanation: "Not called seeing"—the tenth ground causal position not seeing fruition nature is called "not seeing." The Nirvana Sutra says: "tenth ground bodhisattvas see unclearly. Buddha ground sees clearly from beginning to end." Second, manifesting fruition as different from cause saying "What is called seeing is omniscience. Therefore I say 'Only Buddha has knowledge, vision, and awareness'"—manifesting the clarity of Buddha-fruition's seeing nature.

From "anointing samādhi" below to "what learning patience does not know, see, or awaken to." Third, explaining cause as different from fruition. The text saying "From anointing samādhi to what learning patience does not know, see, or awaken to"—the tenth ground's vajra samādhi. Learning patience refers to the thirty minds. "What is not known, seen, or awakened to" is the causal position, therefore not seeing Buddha-nature.

"Only Buddha suddenly understands, not called faith." Fourth, explaining fruition as different from cause. The text saying "Only Buddha suddenly understands,

not called faith"—myriad practices all complete, Buddha's illumination of principle is exhausted, therefore called sudden.

"Those who gradually subdue, though wisdom arises and ceases, are able to use non-arising and non-ceasing." Fifth, concluding cause as different from fruition, saying "Those who gradually subdue, though wisdom arises and ceases"—clarifying the impermanence of the causal path. "Able to use non-arising and non-ceasing" clarifies being able to extinguish those arising-ceasing afflictions. Another explanation: if knowing cause is not cause, knowing arising is not arising, therefore saying "able to use non-arising and non-ceasing."

"If this mind is extinguished, then no burden remains unextinguished." Sixth, concluding fruition as different from cause: first dharma explanation, next analogy explanation, then synthesis. First saying "this mind" refers to the mind of fundamental ignorance abode. "If extinguished" means fundamental ignorance abode is extinguished. Clarifying the causal path's separation from arising-ceasing. Saying "then no burden remains unextinguished" clarifies eliminating obstacles beyond burdens.

"Non-arising and non-ceasing, entering principle-exhaustion vajra samādhi, same as true limit, equal to dharma-nature, yet unable to equal the unequalled equal." Saying "non-arising and non-ceasing" means ultimate purity. Illuminating principle and exhausting the source, therefore saying "entering principle-exhaustion samādhi." Saying "same as true limit" means identically meeting no-attainment. "Equal to dharma-nature" means knowing all phenomena are non-dual. "Yet unable to equal the unequalled equal" means not yet the same as Buddha.

"Like a person climbing a great high platform, observing everything with nothing unclear." The commentary says: From "like" below is analogical explanation. Saying "Like a person climbing a great high platform" refers to the Tathāgata ground.

"Dwelling in principle-exhaustion samādhi is also like this." Saying "Dwelling in principle-exhaustion samādhi is also like this" is the synthesis.

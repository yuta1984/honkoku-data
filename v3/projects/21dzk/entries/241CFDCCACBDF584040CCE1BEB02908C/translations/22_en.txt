"Bodhisattva mahāsattvas constantly illuminate the two truths within ultimate meaning to transform sentient beings." The commentary says: The first text on transformative capacity states "bodhisattvas constantly illuminate the two truths within ultimate meaning to transform sentient beings" means within the middle way's single true truth, constantly illuminating the two truths of emptiness and existence to transform sentient beings. What is called "constantly illuminating the two truths" is precisely using great compassion and prajñā to transform sentient beings. Through prajñā, being in saṃsāra without attachment, thus differing from ordinary beings. Through great compassion, not dwelling in nirvana, differing from śrāvakas. Not abandoning saṃsāra, differing from śrāvakas. Not abandoning nirvana, differing from ordinary beings. Hence saying "constantly illuminating the two truths to transform sentient beings."

"Buddha and sentient beings are one without duality." The commentary says: From "Buddha and" below, the second extensively clarifies that the transformed sentient beings and dharmas are all empty and non-dual. Within this are two parts. First clarifying emptiness of persons, then analyzing emptiness of dharmas. The text on emptiness of persons "Buddha and sentient beings are one without duality" means Buddha and sentient beings are originally nirvanic, identically having no-attainment. Hence saying "one without duality." Taking the meaning: first, both medicine and disease are eliminated. Consider this.

"Why? Because of emptiness of sentient beings one obtains placing emptiness of bodhi; because of emptiness of bodhi one obtains placing emptiness of sentient beings." The commentary says: From "Why?" below explains "because of emptiness of sentient beings one obtains placing emptiness of bodhi." Sentient beings and bodhi are identically without attainment. The suchness of sentient beings and suchness of bodhi have no difference, hence saying "placing." This is not two things mutually placing each other.

"Because of emptiness of all dharmas, therefore empty-emptiness." The commentary says: The text "because of emptiness of all dharmas, therefore called empty-emptiness" - emptiness of all dharmas generally indicates the emptiness of all dharmas. Dharma gates are immeasurable and cannot be completely enumerated. Now generally indicating "all" encompasses the inexhaustible, hence saying "because of emptiness of all dharmas." The Treatise on Great Wisdom's eighteen emptinesses, etc.

Consider this.

"Why? Prajñā is signless." The commentary says: From "Why?" below explains the two emptinesses. The text "prajñā signless" explains the emptiness of that wisdom. Having no birth-characteristics in wisdom is called emptiness.

"Two truths are like empty space." The commentary says: The text "two truths are like empty space" explains the emptiness of those two-truth dharmas. Because everything is ultimately pure, it's called "empty space."

"Prajñā empties ignorance." The commentary says: The text "prajñā empties ignorance" means dharmas of causes and conditions are naturally empty in their original nature. One need not infer through wisdom and afterward clarify emptiness. But sentient beings falsely don't know, so again borrowing wisdom's illumination, they attain emptiness.

"Up to sarvajna having no self-characteristic, no other-characteristic." The commentary says: "Up to sarvajna having no self-characteristic, no other-characteristic" means internally exhausting contemplation is called "no-self"; externally purifying all conditions is called "no-other."

"When the five eyes are perfected, seeing has no object seen." The commentary says: From "five eyes" below, the second section focuses exclusively on fruition ground to clarify the non-duality of perceiver and perceived. The text "seeing has no object seen" means this seeing is the seeing of no-seeing. Saying "no object seen" means all dharmas are originally pure—what would be seen? Yet saying "seeing" follows conventional usage, so there's no fault. The Lotus Sutra clarifies Buddha-eye seeing six-realm sentient beings; the Perfection of Wisdom clarifies five eyes not seeing sentient beings. The Lotus is precisely no-seeing's seeing; Perfection of Wisdom is precisely seeing no-seeing. This sutra raises the non-absence of objects seen to reveal the non-existence of the perceiving subject.

"Acting also not accepting." The commentary says: "Acting also not accepting" - the Perfection of Wisdom's non-accepting samādhi completely has five phrases. Here there are precisely four phrases. If taking "up to everything also not accepting," this is precisely the fifth phrase. "Acting also not accepting" - the Treatise on Great Wisdom says "acting also not accepting" treats the view of existence.

"Not-acting also not accepting." The commentary says: "Not-acting also not accepting" eliminates the view of nonexistence. Speaking nonexistence is to treat existence, not meaning having this nonexistence. Speaking existence to eliminate nonexistence, not meaning having this existence. Speaking nonexistence has never been nonexistence; speaking existence has never been existence. Due to antidotal causes and conditions, there is this teaching.

"Neither acting nor not-acting also not accepting." The commentary says: "Neither acting nor not-acting" - even having causes is unattainable, how much more having no causes? Consider this.

"Up to all dharmas also not accepting." The commentary says: "All dharmas also not accepting" - according to the Treatise on Great Wisdom, this is precisely "not-accepting also not accepting."

"When bodhisattvas have not yet achieved buddhahood, they take bodhi as afflictions; when bodhisattvas achieve buddhahood, they take afflictions as bodhi." The commentary says: From "bodhisattvas not yet buddhas" below, the third section doubly concludes the non-duality of cause and effect. Saying "when bodhisattvas have not yet achieved buddhahood, they take bodhi as afflictions" is like knotting cloth to make a rabbit. Those who understand see cloth; those who are deluded see a rabbit. Also like a sick person eating sweetness as bitterness; when the illness is cured, taking the former bitterness as sweetness. There is no separate different dharma. Due to delusion, seeing non-birth-death as birth-death. Afflictions are also thus. Through delusion, bodhi is precisely afflictions. Awakening to this, afflictions are precisely bodhi.

"Why? Because in ultimate meaning there is no duality, therefore all tathāgatas up to all dharmas are suchness."

【Lower section of left page】
The commentary says: From "Why?" below explains the above "afflictions are precisely bodhi." "In ultimate meaning, no duality" means afflictions and bodhi are identically without substantial existence, hence saying "no duality." "Up to all dharmas" all transcend mental activities, hence called "suchness." Above concludes the first question and answer.

"Addressing the Buddha: How do the tathāgatas of the ten directions and all bodhisattvas not separate from written words yet practice the characteristics of all dharmas?" The commentary says: From "the king addressed the Buddha" below, the second question and answer clarifies the non-duality of all dharmas, having two parts. First questioning, then answering. Within the various questions are two meanings. The first question's meaning says: How does the above teaching that "bodhi constantly illuminates the two truths within ultimate meaning truth to transform sentient beings" - within ultimate meaning, what is there to transform? Yet saying "buddhas and bodhisattvas constantly expound the twelve divisions of scripture to transform sentient beings, not separating from written words yet attaining liberation." If written words are precisely quiescent, how can one practice the characteristics of all dharmas? How can one transform sentient beings within ultimate meaning? Second, remotely taking the above question: the previous Emptiness chapter clarified protecting Buddha-fruition and protecting the ten stages. Within ultimate meaning there is no protector or protected - how can one protect Buddha-fruition, protect the ten stages, and transform sentient beings? Consider this.

"Great King, the dharma wheel is dharma-source suchness." The commentary says: The second answer has four parts. First clarifying the suchness of the spoken twelve divisions of scripture. Second, from "Great King, suchness-suchness" below, clarifying the three kinds of Buddha-nature. From "If bodhisattvas" below, the third presents the methods of cultivation. From "Great King, if bodhisattvas protect the Buddha" below, the fourth concludes. In the first section are two parts. Previously, regarding the twelve divisions of scripture, clarifying the suchness of two-truths teaching. From "These are name-taste-phrases" below, next encouraging to rely on written words to grasp suchness, not to grasp name-words. The twelve divisions of scripture - the dharma wheel is precisely dharma-source suchness. In the Western land it's called sūtra. This is called dharma-source, meaning the source of explaining principles. Also can serve as the source for the twelve divisions. Saying

This is how bodhisattvas practice transforming the ten grounds through prajñāpāramitā - Overall conclusion.

Addressing the Buddha: "If all dharmas are thus, when bodhisattvas protect and transform sentient beings, is it for transforming sentient beings?" - Moonlight again requests the previous meaning. Even sentient beings cannot be obtained—how can they be transformed? Commentary states: "Bodhisattvas transforming sentient beings"—the king heard the Buddha's above teaching that sentient being characteristics are quiescent, immediately formed an understanding of emptiness saying there is no transformer or transformed. Therefore doubt arose.

Great King, dharma-nature 《Split writing: [margin] Another name for ultimate emptiness 《Split writing: text》》 form, sensation, perception, mental formations, consciousness, permanence, bliss, self, purity—not dwelling in form 《Split writing: [margin] Below, four phrases distinguished》, not dwelling in non-form, not dwelling in non-non-form, up to sensation, perception, mental formations, consciousness also not dwelling in non-non-dwelling - Commentary states: The answer has five distinctions. First, answering according to awakened entry: If speaking of the minds of buddhas and bodhisattvas, originally there are neither transformed nor transformer. Second, according to manifest function, following conventional truth, there are only sentient beings to be transformed. Third, returning and concluding back to awakened entry. Fourth, clarifying that both wrong and right views are all called views. Fifth, concluding that if one can follow the conventional, name things, see reality without anything seen, this is called right view. Commentary states: Saying "not form" means knowing form-emptiness and not dwelling. Not only not dwelling in form, but also not dwelling in non-form. Also not dwelling in both form and dwelling-emptiness. Not only not dwelling in both form and emptiness, but also not dwelling in neither form nor emptiness. Because the path of language is cut off and the place of mental activity is extinguished, it says "not dwelling in non-not-dwelling." Also saying "not dwelling in non-non-form"—having already said that both form and non-form cannot be dwelt in, how could non-non-form have dwelling? 《Split writing: text》

Why? Non-form as suchness, non-non-form as suchness - Commentary states: "Why?" below explains the above meaning of not dwelling.

【Upper section of left page】
Non-form as suchness means: not that one analyzes form and only then it becomes empty. Because the essence of form is originally empty, it's called non-form as suchness.

Non-non-form as suchness means: there is no separate emptiness apart from form—form is emptiness. 《Split writing: text》

Through conventional truth, through three provisional designations, it's called seeing sentient beings - Commentary states: Second, following conventional truth, sentient beings can be transformed. 《Split writing: text》 Also states: The Tathāgata depends on conventional truth and three provisional designations, therefore it's called seeing all sentient beings. There is immediately a transformer.

All birth-nature is real - Third, returning to conclude and establish the above meaning of awakened entry where sentient beings are unobtainable. All sentient beings refers to the four births clarified earlier. "Nature is real" means all sentient beings are immediately essentially quiescent—all are real in nature. 《Split writing: text》

Up to buddhas, three vehicles, seven worthies, eight sages are also called views; sixty-two views are also called views - Fourth, clarifying that both wrong and right views are all view-attachment. Because it generally includes ordinary beings and sages, it says "up to." 《Split writing: etc.》 Interpretations of the sixty-two views are not uniform among various explanations. For now, following the Commentary on the Treatise: Originally taking eternalism and annihilationism as fundamental. Going through the five aggregates to clarify that self and world are eternal—this is factual reality, the rest is false speech. This view depends on form. Self and world are impermanent—this is factual reality, the rest is false speech. This view depends on form. Self and world are both eternal and impermanent—this is factual reality, the rest is false speech. This view depends on form. Self and world are neither eternal nor impermanent—this is factual reality, the rest is false speech. This view depends on form. Above form there are four phrases. Above sensation, perception, mental formations, consciousness each also has four phrases—combined there are twenty phrases. World finite/infinite also goes through the five aggregates with twenty phrases. After death, going/not going through the five aggregates, again twenty phrases. Combined, sixty phrases. Body is self,

【Lower section of left page】
body differs from self—two more phrases. Combined to make sixty-two views.

Great King, if one uses names to see all dharmas up to buddhas, three vehicles, four births, it's not that one doesn't see all dharmas - Commentary states: There are only names without reality. Up to the three vehicles, buddhas, four births also only have names. If one can see thus, it's not delusional view but called true view.

Addressing the Buddha: "Prajñāpāramitā has dharmas or non-non-dharmas—how does Mahāyāna illuminate?" - Third, clarifying the text on wisdom-illumination. Making the questions and answers into two. The question asks: Is prajñā existent dharma or non-existent dharma? If it's existent dharma, illuminating function can be distinguished. If prajñā is already not existent, how is there illuminating function? "Non-non-dharma" should say "neither existent nor non-existent." But this sutra is abbreviated, so it directly says "non-non-dharma."

Great King, Mahāyāna sees non-non-dharma. If dharma is non-non-dharma, this is called non-non-dharma emptiness 《Split writing: [margin] Above abbreviated》 dharma-nature emptiness 《Split writing: [margin] Below extensive answer—Great Vehicle prajñā essence》. Form, sensation, perception, mental formations, consciousness emptiness 《Split writing: [margin] Five aggregates retribution emptiness》 twelve entrances emptiness 《Split writing: [margin] Utilization emptiness》 eighteen realms emptiness, six great dharmas emptiness 《Split writing: [margin] Pervasive arrival emptiness》 four truths emptiness 《Split writing: [margin] Realm emptiness》 twelve links emptiness 《Split writing: [margin] Meaning emptiness》—these dharmas are immediately birth, immediately dwelling, immediately extinction, immediately existent, immediately empty. Moments are also thus—dharma birth, dharma dwelling, dharma extinction.

Below "Great King," the second answer has six parts. First, according to awakened entry, clarifying dharma-emptiness. Second, from "but because dharmas gather, there is existence" below, according to manifest function, answering by following the conventional. Third, from "good son" below, raising the negative to reveal the positive. Fourth, from "Great King, this sutra's names, flavors, phrases" below, comparing quantities to reveal superiority. Fifth, from "Great King, seeing realm, seeing wisdom" below, concluding the above learning the negative to reveal the positive. Sixth, from "good son, if there is cultivation" below, encouraging faithful acceptance and upholding to answer the above question about the meaning of protecting Buddha-results. From Mahāyāna to non-non-dharma emptiness...

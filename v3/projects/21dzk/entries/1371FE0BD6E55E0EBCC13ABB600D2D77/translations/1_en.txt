These are precepts to be received. If receiving these precepts constitutes renunciation, then the multitudes of desire-realm and form-realm heavens, the classes of dragon spirits and demons, and the groups of slaves and animals could all become great monks. Therefore, the provision making Enryaku-ji's ordination platform renunciant precepts lacks authentic scriptural teaching. Even if bodhisattva precept grades are conferred merely for accomplishing merit and virtue, they should not be made the ceremonial form of renunciant ordination. Yet why do the monks of Enryaku-ji become confused about the characteristics of precepts and use bodhisattva precepts as renunciant precepts? The monks of Enryaku-ji, though not bhikṣus, wear bhikṣu robes; though not great monks, they occupy the positions of great monks. How can they not understand the ceremonial forms of the precepts and vinaya? That Mount Hiei's ordination platform should be considered a subsidiary ordination platform is logically inevitable. The disciples of the Tendai school should submit to the source of precepts and vinaya and not raise disputes.

The Superiority and Inferiority of the Hossō and Tendai Schools
The Hossō Mahāyāna school originated when Maitreya Bodhisattva, the great being awaiting Buddhahood, after personally approaching and learning from Śākyamuni Buddha, descended to Ayodhyā in India at the request of Asaṅga Bodhisattva, emitted great radiance, assembled those with karmic connections, expounded the Five Treatise Collections, and spread the true school of Yogācāra. The teachers of this school tradition in India, China, and Japan are manifestations of bodhisattvas responding to needs. At that time in Western India, the founding masters who studied Maitreya's yoga were numerous—over thirty families of people at the Buddha's level, all bodhisattvas of pre-ground and post-ground stages, with ten thousand student disciples. These were truly people of unparalleled wisdom and virtue. Dharmapāla Bodhisattva was a Buddha of the Bhadrakalpa, Dignāga was a dharma-cloud ultimate bodhisattva—all were disciples of Maitreya awaiting Buddhahood. Besides these were great masters such as Sthiramati and other bodhisattvas, as well as Śīlabhadra and Śubhagupta. Generally, India had over eighty families of masters, all high ancestors of the Madhyamaka school, with ten thousand student disciples, all scholars of the Yogācāra school. However, regarding the Tendai school, there was not a single master or scholar throughout the five regions of India. Since the origin of Buddhism is India, when we search for Yogācāra founders in China, we find Xuanzang Tripiṭaka, Master Kuiji, Master Huizhao, Master Puguang, Master Yi, Master Fan, Master Woncheuk, Master Daocheng, Master Yaoji, and others. Although there were many translation tripiṭakas, they all corrupted the Buddha's words, leaving errors in the palm leaves west of the Onion Mountains. Among them, only Yogācāra founder Xuanzang Tripiṭaka made no errors in translation; his sūtra and treatise translations accorded with Buddha-wisdom. This was the transformative activity of Sadāprarudita Bodhisattva. Master Kuiji, when composing the Xuanzan commentary to explain the Lotus Sūtra, witnessed all Buddhas assembling and emitting great radiance during the Jeweled Stupa chapter, providing testimony and praise. This was a manifestation of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva. The Chinese founders of the Yogācāra school were long-accomplished Tathāgatas and deeply advanced

bodhisattvas. Among the Tendai founders of Tang China, who could equal Yuhua Tripiṭaka Xuanzang? What could match Kuiji, master of a hundred commentaries? Though Tendai's Guanding and others barely established sectarian positions, their wisdom did not even reach the level of Yogācāra's lesser disciples. Judging sectarian superiority through Chinese founders is like comparing firefly light to the virtue of sun and moon—how could the approximate Tendai equal the true school of Yogācāra? Next, searching for Yogācāra worthies in our Japanese realm, we find Gyōki, Zenju, Gomyō, Myōsen, Jōtō, Rine, Dōsen, Seihan, Shingi, Chūsan, Shuchō, Heinin, Heibi, Zōri, and others. Among these, Gyōki, Zenju, and Seihan were manifestations of Mañjuśrī; Chūsan and Zōri were manifestations of Avalokiteśvara. In the Tendai school, they revere only Dengyō, Jikaku, and others as worthies, but these were already disciples of Yogācāra lineages. Measuring masters, founders, and former worthies across India, China, and Japan, the superiority of Yogācāra over Tendai requires no debate. In India, all five regions believed in and revered Maitreya's teachings. Among them, King Harṣavardhana, King Kumāra, King Gaochang, the King of Magadha, and layman Xuanjian especially became patrons of Yogācāra, venerating the Vijñānavāda middle school. Therefore, when Yogācāra founder Xuanzang traveled to western India and established Vijñānavāda logical arguments, King Harṣa took up parasols and surrounded him, King Kumāra held banners and attended him. The wise emperor of India's ten virtues personally took up parasols and pointed banners, respecting Yogācāra's awesome virtue. The King of Magadha revered Master Śīlabhadra of Nālandā monastery, making daily offerings. King Gaochang built a high great seat for Xuanzang and, with his imperial jade body, became a seat-bridge to receive the Tripiṭaka's feet.

India's wise emperors, for Yogācāra founders, either made daily offerings or became foot-bridges. Truly, the reverence for Yogācāra was most clearly manifest. However, for the Tendai school, throughout the five regions of India, there was not even one patron. Here it is known that among India's various countries, only the Yogācāra school was especially flourishing, while the Tendai school completely lacked doctrinal texts. India is called the central country because Buddha appeared there; this land is called a border country because Buddha did not appear here. India is the central country because the four reliable bodhisattvas appeared there; this land is border territory because the four reliable bodhisattvas did not appear here. India is called the central country because wheel-turning kings appear there; this land is called borderland because only petty kings appear here. The Yogācāra school arose from India—it is Maitreya's teaching. The Tendai school began in China—it is a human teacher's sūtra lectures. How could the words of borderland petty kings and human teachers compete in debate with the teachings of Maitreya from central India? Next, in Tang China, Emperors Taizong and Gaozong especially became patrons of Yogācāra. Emperor Taizong made Chang'an's Yuhua Palace Xuanzang's residence, exclusively venerating Yogācāra. China's emperor made Luoyang's treasure palace Xuanzang's dwelling. In China too, appreciation for Yogācāra was truly evident. How could Tendai match such esteem? Next, the patrons of our Japanese realm were Emperor Kōgyoku, Emperor Tenji, and Grand Minister Kamatari, who built great monasteries and established the Yogācāra school. Generally, in Japan, in the thirteenth year of Emperor Kinmei's reign, when King Seimei of Baekje presented Buddha images and sūtra-treatises to our court, Buddhism flourished in our land, and Japan entered

The Matter of the Superiority and Inferiority of Precepts at Nanto and Mount Hiei

When we investigate the source of precepts, generally among the six perfections practiced by bodhisattvas, there are three different types within the perfection of precepts (śīla-pāramitā). First is the precept of restraint (saṃvara-śīla), which means properly distancing oneself from laws that should be abandoned. Second is the precept of embracing wholesome dharmas (kuśala-dharma-saṃgrāhaka-śīla), which means properly cultivating and realizing dharmas that should be cultivated and realized. Third is the precept of benefiting sentient beings (sattvārtha-kriyā-śīla), which means properly bringing benefit and happiness to all sentient beings. Among these, the first precept of restraint is the precept received jointly by śrāvakas and bodhisattvas, Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna. This precept of restraint is also called the complete precepts or the bhikṣu precepts. Thus the saṅgha of greater and lesser bhikṣus is established. Even if one is a bodhisattva, one first receives the bhikṣu precepts and joins the bhikṣu community. Then one can receive the bodhisattva precepts. If a bodhisattva does not receive the bhikṣu precepts, they would not be part of the bhikṣu community. If a bodhisattva receives the bhikṣu precepts, they are called the bodhisattva-bhikṣu community. If śrāvaka practitioners receive the bhikṣu precepts, they are called the śrāvaka-bhikṣu community. Generally, the renunciant precepts are called the Three Jewels' Saṅgha. The Saṅgha Jewel is called the bhikṣu-saṅgha. Even if one is a bodhisattva, if they do not receive bhikṣu precepts and are not bhikṣu-saṅgha, they belong to laypeople and can hardly be called renunciant monks. Therefore, we speak of bodhisattva monks, śrāvaka monks, and ordinary monks because they receive bhikṣu precepts and thus establish the name of the Saṅgha Jewel. The complete precepts of Nanto are precisely the precepts of restraint among the three levels of bodhisattva precepts-perfection.

These are called bhikṣu precepts. The followers of Mount Hiei are confused about the grades of precepts and do not receive the bhikṣu precepts of Nanto. Since they are not bhikṣu monks, they should be classified as laypeople. Here, Amoghavajra received bodhisattva precepts at age thirteen but later received bhikṣu precepts. Jianzhen received bodhisattva precepts at eighteen but later received complete precepts at twenty-one. Emperor Shōmu requested and received bodhisattva precepts from Bodhisattva Gyōki but later received bhikṣu precepts from Jianzhen. If Nanto's complete precepts were śrāvaka Hīnayāna precepts, why would Amoghavajra, Jianzhen, and Emperor Shōmu abandon Mahāyāna for Hīnayāna? It is known that Nanto's complete precepts are not exclusively Hīnayāna precepts. Generally, the ordination platform of Tōdai-ji follows the ceremonial forms approved jointly by India, China, and Japan. When Emperor Shōmu issued an edict on the sixth day of the fifth month of Tenpyō-Shōhō 6 to establish an ordination platform at Tōdai-ji, Master Jianzhen of Qinglongsi, a disciple of Master Manzhu Rongji, who was a dharma successor of Master Daoxuan of Zhongnanshan in Tang China, along with Monk Fajin of Baita Temple in Yangzhou, a disciple of Dharmakṣema of Central India, these two masters received the imperial edict. Middle Counselor Fujiwara no Takafusa served as the ceremonial imperial messenger. Thus Masters Jianzhen and Fajin, together with the imperial messenger, following the sūtras and diagrams, established the ordination hall of Tōdai-ji, with twenty-one provinces contributing support. Construction began in Tenpyō-Shōhō 6 (754 CE) and was completed by the tenth year, within just two years.

It was completed. Daoxuan of Zhongnanshan in Tang China transplanted the ordination platform of India, and Jianzhen, following the ordination platform of Zhongnanshan, established the ordination hall of Nanto. Fajin also transmitted the customs of India and produced diagrams of the ordination platform. This was not the first ordination platform in Japan, but followed the ancient customs of India and China. Who could harbor doubts about the complete precepts of Tōdai-ji? When we investigate the ordination platform of Zhongnanshan in Tang China, when Master Daoxuan wished to build an ordination platform following Indian customs, suddenly a sage appeared naturally and showed him the method of the ordination platform. When Daoxuan did not believe this, a novice came seeking that sage. At that time Master Daoxuan asked the novice: "Who is this sage?" The novice answered: "The sage is Venerable Pindola." At this time Master Daoxuan first developed faith and, following the sage's instruction, dug the earth down to the water level. At each of the four corners stood an upright stone, six feet high. On these stones were inscriptions. This was the ordination platform for bhikṣu precepts from the time of Kāśyapa Buddha, called the Qingguan Temple Ordination Platform. The current ordination platform of Tōdai-ji entirely copies these ceremonial forms. It is not merely the same as the ordination platform of India from Śākyamuni Buddha alone, but also copies the ceremonial forms of ancient Kāśyapa. The ordination platform of Nanto follows the ancient ceremonies of China and India, following the traces of past and future Buddhas, with the ceremonial form of ascending the platform to receive precepts. The ordination platform of Nanto should be taken as the foundation. The current ordination platform of Enryaku-ji emerges from Saichō's new interpretation and does not follow Śākyamuni's correct teaching. In the five regions of India, what diagram does it follow? Among the four continents, what country's platform does it copy? Thus in the past, during the reign of Emperor Saga in the Kōnin era, Enryaku-ji's

Saichō petitioned to establish an ordination platform on Mount Hiei, but because the monks of various temples did not permit it, the imperial decision was not made. Saichō died without achieving his aspiration. Later, Enryaku-ji Administrator Kokudō no Asomi waited for the opportunity when wise government was gradually declining and obtained a time when Buddhism was weakening, repeatedly petitioned and received imperial permission. After this, Denshō, in order to establish the Mount Hiei ordination platform, met with Jōsen, the ninth abbot of Nanto's ordination platform, and requested soil from the four corners of Tōdai-ji's ordination hall, enshrined it in the Mount Hiei ordination platform, and completed the establishment of the platform grounds. Denshō's petition letter remains at Tōdai-ji. Here it is known that Nanto is the main ordination platform and Mount Hiei is the branch ordination platform. Moreover, Saichō was a disciple of Temple Administrator Jinshū of Kōfuku-ji. After receiving complete precepts at the Shōsō-in, he resided at Daian-ji. Later he ascended Mount Hiei and petitioned to establish an ordination platform. Next, Denshō was a child disciple of Enshū of the Eastern Golden Hall community at Kōfuku-ji. He was also named Ennin, namely Itōmaru. Also, Jikaku received bhikṣu precepts at Tōdai-ji's ordination hall. The founders of precept transmission revered at Mount Hiei's ordination platform—Saichō, Denshō, and others—were all from Nanto lineages. How could they slander the great precepts of renunciant completion? Generally, using the bodhisattva's ten major prohibitive precepts and forty-eight minor precepts as the precepts for renunciant great monks has no basis in the sacred teachings. The Brahmajāla and Yingluo sūtras completely lack such explanations. The Śīla and Bodhisattvabhūmi texts completely lack such passages. Bodhisattva precepts are common to the desire and form realms, five destinies, renunciant and lay

Buddhism. In the age of wise kings and sage rulers, fifteen great temples were built and established in the southern capital (Nara), all venerating the Yogācāra school. If Tendai were the true school, why was Tendai not established in the seven great temples during the time of ancient wise kings? Truly, whether speaking of India, China, or Japan, the origin of Buddhism is the Yogācāra school taught by Maitreya. Vasubandhu Bodhisattva initially studied Hinayāna and slandered the Yogācāra school's doctrine of five distinct natures, but later when he turned his mind to study Mahāyāna, he regretted having previously slandered Yogācāra Mahāyāna and suddenly tried to cut his tongue to apologize for his error. If Maitreya's teachings were not true Buddhism, why would Vasubandhu Bodhisattva, master of a thousand treatises, have felt such regret?

　I humbly reflect that though the three studies follow different paths, they necessarily converge in the elimination of outflows; the five vehicles operate broadly, taking precept-foundation as primary. Therefore, the manifest precepts serve as bridges for all practices, and with願-less mind I pray for the excellent traces of the seven limbs. However, though Dōkai through past karmic fortune was able to join the Dharma gate, not having ascended to pure restrictions, I am constantly apprehensive day and night. Now, on the 3rd day of the 10th month of Kemmu 1 (1334), I received full ordination at the ordination platform hall of Tōshōdai-ji. I humbly wish that the Great Virtue's compassion might provide assistance; please briefly consider this respectful salutation. Respectfully submitted.

　I humbly reflect that in the long night of ignorance, precept-light serves as torch, and after [the Buddha's] extinction, prātimokṣa serves as teacher. Therefore, monks freed from bondage escape grass-binding in royal excursions, and alms-seeking monks manifest swan-pearls after death. Thus the three contemplations of Buddha-vehicle bind the three bodies in ultimate realization, and the three types of pure precepts open the three causes at initial arousal. However, through fortunate past karma I was able to encounter excellent conditions, abandoning falsehood to seek truth and earnestly praying for precept-grades. May the supreme Buddha-seed thereby flourish, and the dense forest of dust and toil thereby be pacified. Now, on the 8th day of the 4th month of Kagen 2 (1304), I received bodhisattva separate liberation precepts at the Mahāyāna Ordination Platform Hall of Enryaku-ji on Mount Hiei. I humbly wish for compassionate salvation. Respectfully submitted with salutation.
　Kagen 2, 4th month, 8th day　　Novice Chikan respectfully submits
This monk now receives compassionate salvation and is led to receive pure precepts; accepting the Dharma in mind, the river of merit flows and settles. I humbly request that the present precept-transmitting preceptor kindly reveal his name to serve forever as precept-verification.

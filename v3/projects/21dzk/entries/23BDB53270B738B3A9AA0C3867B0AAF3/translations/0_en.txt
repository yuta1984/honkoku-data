Title: Vinaya School Precious Mirror Chapter, Volume 6 [Note: According to the Jōrakuin text, of the complete sixty volumes, only this one volume remains, which is regrettable]
Written by Gyōnen, monk of Tōdaiji Temple

Ninth: On the Classical Texts Studied. Question: What are the names of the fundamental sutras, vinayas, and treatises that the Vinaya school relies upon, takes as doctrine, and studies? Also, how many commentaries and annotations exist?

Answer: The dharma texts that the Vinaya school relies upon and studies are not limited to single scrolls. The collections are extremely numerous. The general precept characteristics extend comprehensively across the three clusters, while the specific precept characteristics extensively clarify the disciplinary rules. These are collected and encompassed to form the Vinaya school collection, embracing both Mahayana and Hinayana teachings and connecting to the dharma of the three baskets.

The matter of the Bodhisattva precept school runs deep. The various teachings recorded in the catalogues include both Mahayana and Hinayana vehicles... [missing characters] The sutra teachings of the Mahayana vinaya collection are numerous... [missing characters] When citing the sections on Bodhisattva precept dharma from various schools, some are single volumes, some are single chapters, some span multiple volumes, and some are merely single sections. They do not necessarily expound the precept dharma completely from beginning to end, but simply take all places where precepts are expounded as their foundation and study material.

The Brahma Net Sutra in two volumes: In the lower volume, from the verses down to "joyfully accepting and upholding," Kumārajīva separately named this the "Bodhisattva Precept Text." Within this one volume, it correctly explains the ten grave and forty-eight light precepts of bodhisattvas. The major section on precepts in the Pusa yingluo [Bodhisattva?] sutra, one volume of precept sections in the Shanjiie jing... the Shanjiie jing, the precept pāramitā of the Yogācāra bodhisattva-bhūmi, followed by precept dharma of the Four-Part Vinaya and others, and the precept section of the Dilun - these share the same source as the Yogācāra texts. The six grave and twenty-eight light precepts in the Shanzisheng jing, the Pusa neijie jing, and the sections in the Fangdeng jing explaining twenty-four and twenty-five precepts...

The Dichi jieben and Bodhisattva Precept Karmavācanā both derive from complete texts. The precept reception dharma sections in the Zhanche jing - all these sutras explain the characteristics of the great bodhisattva precepts. Some comprehensively represent the three clusters of pure precepts, while others represent only portions of those precepts. There are sections that are exclusively unshared... [missing characters]. All of these are taken as the fundamental sutras that serve as foundation, doctrine, and study material for the bodhisattva precepts.

Among these, the Dichi and Yogācāra belong to the Mātṛkā collection, while all others belong to the Sūtra collection. In the Zhanche jing, when explaining the foundation and study material for bodhisattva precepts, it cites both the Śrāvaka vinaya collection and the Bodhisattva Mātṛkā collection. Mātṛkā means "fundamental matrix" and refers to the treatise collection, corresponding to texts like the Dichi and Yogācāra.

The ten types of precepts in the Wisdom Treatise, the excellence of precept study in the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha, and the explanation of the five categories and ten good deeds in the Pure Ground of the Daśabhūmi-śāstra - such examples all constitute fundamental matrices. The Pure Conduct, Noble Conduct, and Ten Treasuries chapters of the Avataṃsaka, the Peaceful and Joyful Conduct chapter of the Lotus Sutra, and the teachings in the Nirvana Sutra... [missing characters] that explain the methods and standards for bodhisattva cultivation of precept dharma - some are shared... [missing characters] unshared approaches are not limited to two. All of these are explained in the Sūtra collection.

In the Yogācāra treatise, the precept dharma taught in various teachings is collected and systematized, generally bound together and accumulated as the three clusters of precepts. Therefore, the scattered explanations of precepts throughout various teachings, discussed in their respective places, all serve as foundation and study material. By studying the Yogācāra texts, one accomplishes this task. Among the various catalogues, many record Mahayana vinaya collections, but taking the essential from among them corresponds to the sutras mentioned above. Others are not included because they are not essential. The textual teachings on the disciplinary rules of the specific reception approach are entirely found in the Hinayana vinaya sections of the catalogues. These also represent the characteristics of general reception disciplinary rules, and what the Yogācāra texts point to are all of this nature. However, among the various vinayas that serve as study material and foundation clarified here, this refers to the Four-Part Vinaya. The others...

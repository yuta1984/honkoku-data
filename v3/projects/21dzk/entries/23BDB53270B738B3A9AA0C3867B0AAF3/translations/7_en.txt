He produced many disciples, and those versed in vinaya were numerous. That Vinaya Master Zenshun of Daianji Temple had the reputation of being learned in vinaya was because he was one of his disciples. Eiei and Fushō studied in the Tang court for ten years, researching various teachings. In the first year of Tianbao, year Renwo (corresponding to the fourteenth year of Tenpyō in Japan), they went to Daming Temple in Yangzhou, paid respects at the feet of Great Master Jianzhen, fully explained their purpose, and requested him to travel to the eastern seas to propagate the precepts and vinaya. The Master consented. His disciple Xiangyan first agreed to accompany them. Subsequently, monks Daoxing, Daohang, Shenxiang, Zongren, Lingfa, Ming□, Daodian, Daoyin, Fazang, Zuojing, Daoyi, Youyan, Rufa, Chengguan, Deqing, Situo and others—twenty-one people in total—with one heart wished to accompany them. Including other monastics and laypeople, the total combined number was over eighty people. After completing the arrangements, they built ships and prepared provisions. During the ocean crossing there were various difficulties. Opposing waves surged, they passed but returned again. They built ships four times, entered the sea five times, and for twelve years their hardships were immeasurable. Thirty-six monastics and laypeople died during the journey, including Eiei and Xiangyan. Two hundred eighty people turned back. Only the Great Master, Fushō, and Situo took death as their deadline and had no thought of retreating. The first departure was in the second year of Tianbao, year Guiwei. The final sixth attempt was in the twelfth year of Tianbao, year Guisi (corresponding to the fifth year of Tenpyō-shōhō in Japan). On the fifteenth day of the eleventh month, they boarded ships and left Tang. The disciples who accompanied him were: monk Fajin of Baitang Temple in Yangzhou, monk Tanjing of Chaogong Temple in Quanzhou, monk Situo of Kaiyuan Temple in Taizhou, monk Yijing of Xingyun Temple in Yangzhou, monk Fazai of □yun Lingyao Temple in Weizhou, monk Facheng of Kaiyuan Temple in Douzhou and others—fourteen people in total; three nuns including Zhishou of Tongshan Temple in Tengzhou; upasaka Pan Xiantong of Yangzhou; An Rubao from the Hu kingdom; Jun Fali from the Kunlun kingdom;

Shanting from Champa kingdom—altogether twenty-four people set sail toward this land of Japan. They reached Japanese soil on the twentieth day of the twelfth month in the fifth year of Tenpyō-shōhō, year Guisi, and entered the capital on the fourth day of the second month in the same sixth year, year Jiawu (corresponding to the thirteenth year of Tianbao under Emperor Xuanzong, sixth ruler of Tang). In the several days before entering the capital, monks and laypeople came to comfort and welcome them. They were then led into Tōdaiji Temple and housed there. The Emperor was deeply moved and immediately sent imperial messengers with boundless expressions of comfort. The conferring of precepts and transmission of vinaya was entrusted entirely to the Master. In early April of that year, a precept platform was built in front of the Rushana Hall. The Emperor first ascended the platform to receive the bodhisattva precepts. Next, the Empress and Crown Prince also ascended the platform to receive precepts. Soon after, precepts were conferred on over 440 people including novice Chōshū. Also, over eighty former great monks including Ryōfuku, Kenkyō, Shichū, Zenkō, Dōen, Heittoku, Ninki, Zensha, Gyōsen, and Gyōnin abandoned their old precepts and re-received the precepts conferred by the Master. Later, a Precept Platform Compound was separately built west of the Great Buddha Hall, using soil moved from the Emperor's ordination platform. In the third year of Tenpyō-hōji, year Kihai, the Great Master built Tōshōdaiji Temple and was granted an imperial plaque to be displayed there. He invited Vinaya Master Zenshun of Daianji Temple to lecture on Fali's Vinaya Commentary, Nanshan Vinaya Excerpts, and others. When the ocean-crossing Master came to court, Great Virtue Situo received invitations from Ninki and others of Daianji Temple and lectured on Fali's Commentary and the Chinkoku Record (which is Dingbin's Shizong Record) at that temple's pagoda compound for four to five years, studying it thoroughly several times. Thereafter, Ninki and others propagated Fali's Vinaya Commentary in various places. In the third year of Hōji, Ninki lectured on those commentaries at the Tang Compound of Tōdaiji Temple, Chūe lectured on those commentaries in Ōmi Province, Eshin lectured on those commentaries at the pagoda compound of Daianji Temple, and Jōgi at

the same temple lectured on those commentaries, and Shinpō lectured on those commentaries at Kōfukuji Temple. Japanese vinaya practices were transmitted from teacher to disciple, pervading the entire realm with lectures and propagation. The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya had karmic connections with this land, and the three clusters of great precepts were exclusively propagated in this country. Great Master Jianzhen at age eighteen received bodhisattva precepts from Vinaya Master Dao'an. An was a disciple of Vinaya Master Nanshan. At age twenty-one he received full ordination from Vinaya Master Hongjing and studied vinaya excerpts under Vinaya Master Rongji. Hongjing and Rongji were both disciples of Nanshan. He studied Fali's Vinaya Commentary under the five worthies Yiwei, Yuanzhi, Jinxiu, Huice, and Daliang. These five were all disciples of Vinaya Master Manyi. The Great Master exclusively propagated the Xiangbu and Nanshan Vinaya schools while also mastering Tiantai Lotus Sutra teachings and contemplation. He comprehensively grasped the five vehicles, was thoroughly versed in the three baskets, combined inner and outer teachings, and encompassed both great and small vehicles. He protected the dharma with spiritual response, employed supernatural transformations in guidance, lectured on sutras, vinaya, and treatises, and instructed laypeople. His reputation resonated to the four directions and his virtue flowed throughout the eight directions. The nine provinces revered him as ordination master. He lectured on vinaya and commentaries forty times each, lectured on the Jieshi Excerpt seventy times in total, and lectured on the Qingzhong Karma procedures ten times each. He ordained over forty thousand people before and after. Thirty-five people were especially outstanding among the masses, each establishing themselves in one region and propagating the image teachings. In Japan he established three precept platforms: first, the Tōdaiji Precept Platform; second, the Kanzeon Temple Precept Platform in the western provinces; and third, the Yakushiji Temple Precept Platform in the eastern provinces. All received imperial grace to conduct ordination ceremonies. The Tōdaiji Precept Platform ordained ten people, while the two provincial precept platforms ordained five people each. Tōshōdaiji Temple also built a precept platform. Ordinations in the eastern and western capitals continued without interruption. After coming to court, he spent a total of ten years. The first five years he resided at the Precept Compound and Tang Meditation Compound of Tōdaiji Temple, which was his regular residence. The latter five years he resided at Tōshō-

daiji. Among his disciples who became famous in later generations were: Great Virtue Nikan, Great Monk Administrator Hōshin, Great Virtue Donjō, Great Virtue Hōei, Great Virtue Shitaku, Great Virtue Gijō, Great Virtue Chii, Great Virtue Hōsai, Great Virtue Hōjō, Great Virtue Reiyō, and Great Virtue Waiken—these eleven people received full ordination in Tang. Lesser Monk Administrator Nyohō, Vinaya Master Eun, Great Virtue Eryō, Great Virtue Etatsu, Great Virtue Ejō, and Great Virtue Eki—these six people were also Tang Chinese but received full ordination in this country. Novice Dōkin was also from Tang. These seventeen people accompanied him to court, followed him from beginning to end, and assisted in his teaching ceremonies. The Great Master passed away sitting upright on the sixth day of the fifth month in the seventh year of Tenpyō-hōji, year Kinoto-u (corresponding to the first year of Guangde under Emperor Daizong, eighth ruler of Great Tang, year Kinoto-u). He was seventy-seven years old. Great Master Jianzhen propagated both the Nanshan and Xiangbu schools. Nanshan was the first patriarch, Hongjing the second patriarch, and Jianzhen the third patriarch. Hōshin and Nyohō were both third patriarchs. In the Xiangbu school: first patriarch Fali, second patriarch Daocheng, third patriarch Manyi, fourth patriarch Dairyō, fifth patriarch Jianzhen. Since precepts and vinaya were first transmitted to the eastern seas, therefore in the Japanese realm the Great Master is considered the first patriarch. The Master's disciple Great Monk Administrator Hōshin excelled in the five divisions, was thoroughly versed in the four Agamas, refined and researched Tiantai teachings and contemplation, and propagated and developed the bodhisattva precept collection. For Japanese precept transmission: Great Master Jianzhen was the first master, Great Monk Administrator Hōshin of Tōdaiji Temple was the second master, Lesser Monk Administrator Nyohō of Yakushiji Temple was the third master, Vinaya Master Shōzen of Gangōji Temple was the fourth master, Posthumously Appointed Monk Administrator Hōan of Tōshōdaiji Temple was the fifth master, and Great Monk Administrator Chōe of Kōfukuji Temple was the sixth mas-

The "Bhikṣu Textual Analysis Extract" in one volume, "General Reception Repentance Method" in one volume, "Specific Reception Practice or Not" in one volume, and "Prevention and Mindfulness" in one volume - all of these clarify the characteristics of bodhisattva ordination platforms.

Regarding the commentaries, sub-commentaries, and records within the vinaya collection, although we have listed the vinayas of various schools above, what we study now is only the one vinaya of the Four-Part fundamental collection. Chinese masters who interpreted the Four-Part Vinaya through continuous study and practice number nearly twenty schools. Among the Four-Part Vinaya commentaries transmitted to Japan, while there were many in the past, only two or three schools are currently practiced in the world: Master Zhishou's Great Commentary in twenty volumes, Master Fali's Commentary in ten volumes, Master Huaisu's Commentary in ten volumes called "Record of Opening the School." Master Dingbin of Songyue composed the "Record of Adorning School Doctrine" in ten volumes (expanded to twenty volumes) explaining Fali's commentary. Master Bin separately composed the "Brief Commentary on the Four-Part Precept Text" in one volume, expanded to two volumes.

Great Master Nanshan composed the "Four-Part Vinaya Manual of Procedures" in three volumes expanded to twelve volumes, the "Annotated Precept Text Commentary" in four volumes expanded to eight volumes, the "Commentary on Situational Karmavācanā" in four volumes, and the "Collection of Vinaya Principles Extract" in four volumes. Originally there were three volumes, but the lower volume is not currently practiced in the world; only four volumes exist, with the upper and middle volumes each divided into one-two sections. This is called "Nanshan's Five Great Works." There are also "Ritual for Measuring Severity" in one volume, "Ritual for Monastic Robes and Deportment" in one volume, "Instructional Ritual for New Students" in one volume, "Illustrated Sutra of Monastic Reverence and Respect" in one volume, "Illustrated Sutra of Ordination Platforms" in one volume, "Transmission of Miraculous Responses in Vinaya Matters" in one volume, and "Meaning of Reverence" in one volume. While Nanshan's works are extremely numerous, those belonging to the vinaya section are only these. The "Essential Discussion of Vinaya" in six volumes was composed by Master Xuanhui of Hongfa Temple, the "Śrāmaṇera Sutra Commentary" in five volumes was compiled by Fajin, and the "Four-Part Precept Text Commentary" in one volume was composed by Master San, explaining the Manual of Procedures. From the Tang Dynasty onward, sixty-one schools have been transmitted to Japan and are currently practiced.

The "Great Extract Record" in ten volumes was composed by Zhiren of Silla. Master Ren went to Tang China and personally studied under the author of the Extract, producing over forty volumes of records, but later Master Juexian extracted the essentials and together they formed ten volumes. The "Extract Critique" in fourteen volumes was composed by Dajue, the "Supplementary Record" in ten volumes by Xuanyan, the "Searching the Profound Record" in ten volumes (expanded to twenty volumes) by Zhihong, the "Simple and Correct Record" in seventeen volumes by Jingxiao, the "Harmonizing and Correcting Record" in twelve volumes (with structural outline in three volumes) by Yunkan, and the "Supporting Record" in sixteen volumes (with structural outline in three volumes) by Yuanzhao. The above seven schools are currently circulating.

Also, the "Record of Manifesting Correct Meaning" in ten volumes by Tan'yi is transmitted to Japan and exists in ancient collections. The "Phonetic Meaning Guide" in three volumes was transmitted by Master Fukaki, the "Revealing Record" in eight volumes (with structural outline in two volumes) by Yunkan, and the "Practice Record" in eight volumes (with structural outline in two volumes) by Yuanzhao both explain Nanshan's Precept Text Commentary. The "Correct Source Record" in eight volumes (with Liaoran's structural integration and revision, structural outline in two volumes) by Yunkan and the "Beneficial Conditions Record" in eight volumes (with structural outline in two volumes) by Yuanzhao both explain the Karmavācanā Commentary. The "Supplementary Essential Record" in six volumes by Yunkan explains the "Collection of Vinaya Principles Extract." Yuanzhao also composed a structural outline in one volume. There is also the "Revealing the Hidden Record" in four volumes by Zongyan, which explains that extract. Sairin Sōji composed the "Supporting Practice Record" in eight volumes explaining the Bhikṣuṇī Extract, and Senyū Dōgen composed the "Bhikṣuṇī Extract Preface Explanation" in one volume.

Master Fukaki of Sennyūji has "Tang Decisions" in three volumes for the Procedural Extract, with Tang decisions for each of the two commentaries on precepts and karma. The "Essential Principles of Vinaya Extracts" in one volume, "Chapter on Precept Essence" in one volume, and "Record of Proper Application of Robes and Deportment" in one volume were all composed by Yuanzhao. Yuanzhao's lifetime prefaces, records, poems, verses, and miscellaneous chapters were very numerous; his disciples collected them into nineteen volumes called the "Zhiyuan Collection." Not limited to vinaya matters, the content covers everything. Zhirui's lifetime short chapters were also numerous; disciples edited them into ten volumes, and when Zhirui saw this, he immediately wrote a preface and named it the "Dongwei Collection." Yuanzhao composed the "Six Items

Diagram," which Myōshō refuted, naming it the "New Diagram." Master Yuanzhao composed the "Patriarchal Lineage and Nanshan's Compilation Catalog," and Yunkan immediately composed the "Nanshan Compilation Catalog." The "Convenient Methods for Receiving Precepts" in one volume was composed by Yuanzhao.

The disciples of Master Daizhi each explained the prefaces to the Annotated Precept Text, Annotated Karmavācanā, Supporting Record, as well as the prefaces to the Five Examples Practice Record, Beneficial Conditions Record, and the Ten Karmic Actions Chapter Perfect Teaching Five Gates Proper Application, etc. These include Soku'an, Dōgen, Kaido, Dōhyō, and even later generations like Shuichi. Dōgen compiled the Zhiyuan Collection into seventeen volumes, and later his fellow student Shuki of Siming gathered and completed two additional volumes. The disciples of Master Shō also composed the Uposatha Ritual, Retreat Ritual, Pravāraṇā Ritual, etc. Shuichi's compositions are called "New Preface Explanations," explaining the various prefaces of the record masters. Shuichi composed "Zhongnan School Achievements" in three volumes, and Myōren composed "Direct Refutation of Peng Folding" in one volume [criticizing] the great school achievements. Shuichi also composed "Teaching-Contemplation Folding Peng" in one volume to rescue Myōren's refutation and establish his own doctrine.

Later Master Ryōnen of Fukūin composed the "Penetrating Truth Record" in three volumes (with structural text in one volume) explaining the Reverence Ritual, and Ryōnen also composed "Ritual for Conferring Bodhisattva Precepts" in one volume. Master Daizhi composed "Ritual for Conferring Bodhisattva Precepts" in one volume. It is clearly understood that this intention is to also receive bodhisattva precepts on top of the perfect teaching's fourfold white karma ordination. The Beneficial Conditions Record states: "If one does not maintain receiving the great, then it is perfect and sudden meaning; since it says 'does not wait,' how can one wait to receive?"

Master Shungan Fukaki, the founding master of Sennyūji, entered Song China to transmit the vinaya, and when he returned to Japan, he brought many vinaya texts. From then onward, vinaya masters who entered Song China continued to transmit vinaya school literature. Among the newly transmitted vinaya texts were: Precept Commentary Opening Topics, Kuaiji Doctrinal Chapters, Dongwei Maintaining and Transgressing, Huiyuan Pivot Essentials, Comprehensive Examination Condensed Classics, Phrase Meaning Name Meaning, Three Existences Comparative Meaning, and Controversial New Meaning.

The varieties are not uniform. The doctrinal texts listed above are as described. The rest are not recorded but are clarified as in separate catalogs. All of these represent the dharma gates that practitioners of the general and specific dual reception, one-vehicle perfect teaching bodhisattva path depend upon, revere, and study. The above clarifies the scope of the teachings to be studied.

Section Ten: Transmission and Succession. Question: The Buddha established and taught precepts and vinaya for his disciples, and the disciples received, protected, maintained, and propagated them. From when the Buddha was in the world until after his parinirvāṇa, from the correct dharma period to the semblance and final periods, from the five regions of India to China and elsewhere, from China and elsewhere to present-day Japan, from ancient times to now - what is the character of this sequential transmission, successive inheritance, and propagation?

Answer: The Tathāgata achieved enlightenment and taught the dharma for beings, establishing precepts according to circumstances for forty-nine years. All the great disciples mastered the Tripiṭaka and transmitted both Mahayana and Hinayana teachings without exception. However, in propagation and maintenance, there was not an absence of particular excellence. Venerable Upāli and Gavāmpati maintained and understood the vinaya, spreading their names far and wide. Gavāmpati flowed water and entered nirvana at Trayastriṃśa Heaven, while Upāli remained alone and greatly propagated the vinaya collection. Venerable Kāśyapa extensively collected the Tripiṭaka and generally provided overall guidance for the Buddha's teachings. Therefore, the Tathāgata entrusted the entire Tripiṭaka to Kāśyapa for broad propagation and entrusted the vinaya collection to Upāli. Upāli received this entrustment and transmitted it to later generations.

However, there are two accounts of Upāli's propagation and transmission of the vinaya collection. The Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya and Samantapāsādikā present two different lineage accounts with different personal names. Regarding the transmission lineage of the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya, that vinaya's thirty-second section states: Venerable Upāli, followed by Daśabala, followed by Sonakāvasa, followed by Siggava, followed by Moggaliputta, followed by Mahākassapa [note: some texts read "Dhammapāla"], followed by Kabhinī, followed by Indagutta, followed by Dhammarakkhita, followed by Mahānāga (the above ten), followed by...

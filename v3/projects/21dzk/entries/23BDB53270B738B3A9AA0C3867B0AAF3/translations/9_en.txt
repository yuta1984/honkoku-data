whose virtuous reputation and transformative guidance overflowed far and near, who served as abbot of Kongōin Temple in the capital. At Shinshō's end, he was made to reside at Tōshōdaiji but yielded to Master San and returned to the capital himself. Master Enshō promoted the ordination platform, propagated vinaya dharma with unceasing lectures and expositions, had numerous disciples, and all upheld the teaching school. Master Zen'e was a peerless vinaya master who established influence in one region and produced brilliant disciples.

Master Kakujō passed away early, dying on the nineteenth day of the fifth month in the first year of Kenchō, year Tsuchinoto-tori, at the age of fifty-seven. He lived in this world for fourteen years after self-vowed ordination. Master Eizon of Saidaiji Temple had extremely many disciples, namely Master Ninshō, Ken'nin, Zenzon, Kōen, Jakuson, Shinkū, Sōji, Shōyu, Genki, and others.

teacher for five emperors. Precepts and vinaya were universally spread, filling the realm, the esoteric treasury was widely opened extending throughout all directions, researching the three collections, intensively examining both great and small teachings, many wise people emerged, and temples filled all provinces. He died on the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month in the third year of Shōō, year Kanoe-tora, at the age of ninety. His posthumous title was Kōshō Bodhisattva. After Master Eizon, Great Virtue Shinkū maintained the temple, conferring ordinations and lecturing on vinaya, succeeding to and promoting virtuous reputation. The teacher-student relationship was fragrant and flourishing, prospering year after year with many wise people emerging to assist and promote dharma transformation. Master Sōji was a peer of Kōshō Bodhisattva, with superior learning and understanding, walking the vinaya path alone. Great Virtue Kōson had deep and broad vinaya learning with daily lectures and expositions, producing many wise and virtuous disciples, serving as abbot of Kairyūōji Temple, and spreading his name far and wide. Great Virtue Shin'en had outstanding learning and understanding with brilliant doctrinal eloquence, served as abbot of Hannyaji Temple, and his reputation flew to distant regions. Wise and virtuous masters emerged in groups, all bringing glory to the vinaya garden. All were personally ordained disciples of Master Eizon. The Vinaya School revival filled the entire realm. This was purely through the power of the skillful great vows of the two worthies Kakujō and Eizon. During the Kenkyū era in the reign of the 82nd Human Sovereign, Emperor Go-Toba, there was a monk named Shunpō from Chikuzen (Higo). His aspiration was in learning, focusing especially on precepts and vinaya. He came to the southern capital seeking vinaya dharma. At that time there was a Great Virtue with the dharma name Ren'kō. Following that Great Virtue, he consulted and studied precepts and vinaya, could not cease his efforts, and looked far toward foreign lands. In the first year of Shōji, year Tsuchinoto-hitsuji, during Emperor Tsuchimikado's reign, at age thirty-four, he crossed the sea and entered Song China. This corresponded to the fifth year of Qingyuan under the thirteenth Song Emperor Ningzong. He first encountered Dharma Master Hokuhō Sōin and studied the Tendai school, then followed Vinaya Master Nyo'an Ryōkō and received instruction in the Nanshan Vinaya School, researching intensively and thoroughly with nothing omitted from the two schools. He studied dharma in China for thirteen years. In the first year of Kenryaku, year Kanoto-hitsuji, during Emperor Juntoku's

reign, he returned to Japan. He then built Senyūritsuji Temple in the eastern mountains of northern Kyoto, greatly propagating precepts and vinaya and lecturing on the Tendai school. He propagated vinaya in Japan for seventeen years with unceasing lectures and instruction, and extremely flourishing exposition. In the revival of vinaya propagation in northern Kyoto, Dharma Master Fukaqi was the founding patriarch. He passed away on the eighth day of the third month in the third year of Karoku, year Hinoto-i (Antei era change), at the age of sixty-two. The master's virtue resonated in both countries and his authority spread through myriad generations. At the Senyū vinaya center, precepts and vinaya were greatly practiced with unceasing lectures and expositions, remaining extremely flourishing to this day. The master's disciple Acharya Jōshun greatly lectured on precepts and vinaya, widely benefiting contemporary students. Later worthies Chikyō, Dōgen, Jōin and others were disciples of Master Shun. In the spring of the third year of Katei, year Hinoto-tori, Acharya Jōshun came to Kairyūōji Temple in the southern capital and lectured on minor vinaya texts and other works. People were convinced and came together to listen and study. Eizon, Zen'e, Genshun and others all listened to the lectures. After Jōshun as abbot of Senyū Temple, Great Virtue Chikyō resided there and propagated vinaya. Master Kyō crossed the sea to Song China to listen to vinaya and absorb the teaching atmosphere. Great Virtue Ninkū initially absorbed Master Kyō's teaching atmosphere, then moved to the ordination platform, entered Master Shō's chamber, received full ordination, listened to and studied precepts and vinaya, and maintained transmission of all three gates. He again received full ordination following Master Eizon. After Chikyō, Great Virtue Shin'in served as temple abbot, lecturing on vinaya and propagating the teaching. In was a personally received disciple of founding mountain master Fukaqi, later following Jōshun to study vinaya texts. Great Virtue Jōin received dharma from Jōshun and also consulted with Chikyō, served as abbot of Kaikōritsuji Temple, greatly propagating the semblance teaching. Vinaya dharma flowed and transformed in the eastern provinces, serving as a model for distant generations. Great Virtue Shinshō originally followed Master Enshō to receive ordination and listen to vinaya, also following Great Virtue Jōin to listen to

the great vinaya texts. Ninkū also listened to Jōin's vinaya lectures. Shinshō entered Song China, encountered Myōren Gyōkyo and studied vinaya to resolve doubts. After returning to Japan, he propagated the vinaya ordination platform, later moved to Senyū Temple, and followed Shin'in to study vinaya and resolve obstructions. There was Great Virtue Genshun who originally belonged to the southern capital, later received instruction from Jōshun, researched intensively and thoroughly, mastered the precept school, established influence in one region, and greatly propagated the Way and dharma. After Shin'in, Great Virtue Gangyō served as abbot of Senyū Temple, and later entrusted the temple to Great Virtue Kakua. Kakua followed the two worthies Chikyō and Jōin to research the vinaya collection, promoted both exoteric and esoteric teachings, and greatly spread virtuous reputation. He then entrusted the temple to his disciple Great Virtue Chigen. Master Gen administered the temple, promoted the school, and lectured on vinaya. Thus in the dharma revival, in the southern and northern two capitals, the five home provinces and seven circuits, propagation occurred according to conditions and exposition flowed according to circumstances, spreading horizontally in this manner, and reaching vertically as far as possible. The virtue of the Buddha-dharma's long duration—this vinaya is truly new. The auspicious sign of the nation's great peace—this school is extremely great. Protecting the dharma without limit, saving beings without end. The merit of precepts and vinaya—these matters are clearly evident. The power of moral conduct—the great benefits are brilliantly manifest. The propagation and transmission of the Vinaya School—the essentials are thus.

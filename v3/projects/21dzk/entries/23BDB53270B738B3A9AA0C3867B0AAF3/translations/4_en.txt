Fo Shuo came. In the fourth year of Guanghe, year Xinyou, the upāsaka An Xuan came and translated sutras. In the second year of Zhongping, year Yichou, Zhi Chen arrived on his travels. In the same fourth year, Dingmao, Kang Ju came. In the same fifth year, Wuchen, Yan Fotiao came (According to the Kaiyuan Catalog, based on the Sengyu Catalog and Biographies of Eminent Monks, he should be a śramaṇa; the Changfang and other catalogs calling him a lay devotee is incorrect. The above is from that text).

In the first year of Xingping under the thirteenth ruler Emperor Xian, year Jiaxu, Kang Mengxiang came. In the second year of Jian'an, year Dingchou, Zhu Dali and Tan Gao came together to translate sutras. The above shows twelve people came during the Later Han period (eleven were śramaṇas, one was an upāsaka). Each translated sutras and treatises, propagating the dharma and benefiting beings. Although these monks came from time to time, there were interruptions between arrivals, or insufficient numbers of monks, so ordination ceremonies could not be conducted. It was not until the third year of Huangchu under Emperor Wen, the first ruler of Cao Wei, year Renyin, that Dharmarakṣa first arrived at the Wei court. However, various conditions were not yet prepared, and twenty-eight years passed in vain until the second year of Jiaping, year Gengwu, when ordination for ten people was conducted. In the Wei period, they first obtained this bright pearl (According to Songyue, this was re-ordination; the initial ordination was in the first year of Jianning under Emperor Ling, the eleventh ruler of Later Han, year Wushen, when five śramaṇas from North India came and conducted ordination for five people. The Nanshan school does not recognize such events). This was the initial transmission of ordination for monks. The initial transmission of bhikṣuṇī ordination was in the tenth year of Yuanjia under Song, year Guiyou (According to Songyue, this was re-ordination; the initial ordination for nuns was in the first year of Huangchu under Former Wei, year Gengzi. According to that master's intention, monks and nuns each had initial and repeated ordinations, but according to the Nanshan school, the dharma period of initial transmission to China corresponded to that master's time of repeated ordination for monks and nuns. The present master does not accept this). After 1,199 years since the Tathāgata's passing, the ordination ceremony for monks was first transmitted. From then on, through master-disciple succession, ordination ceremonies continued unbroken in China. At that time in Jiaping, Dharmarakṣa (called Dharma-time) translated the Mahāsāṃghika Prātimokṣa, and Tripiṭaka Master Tanwei translated the Dharmaguptaka Karmavācanā. These two works were first available in Luoyang. This was the initial transmission of precept and vinaya texts. To receive the precept substance, one must rely on karmavācanā. The karmavācanā practices the Dharmaguptaka

school. Therefore, the initial ordination ceremonies in China adopted the Four-Part substance. Regarding practice guidelines, they temporarily followed the Mahāsāṃghika. Although the ordination rituals were already practiced, precept studies translated, and master-disciple succession with continuous lineage maintained, the detailed vinaya practices and doctrinal explanations had not yet been transmitted. The main principles were established, but the details were not yet refined. Since comprehensive explanations were lacking, it was difficult to distinguish between permitted and prohibited actions. From the ordination ceremonies in the second year of Jiaping until the fifth year of Hongshi under Yao Qin, year Guimao, a total of 154 years passed with days and months wasted, still not engaging with vinaya study. In the sixth year of Hongshi, year Jiachen, Puṇyatāra first translated the Ten-Recitation Vinaya, followed by Dharmaruci and Vimalākṣa continuing the translation in sequence. The extensive Ten-Recitation Vinaya in sixty-one volumes underwent three translations before one complete version was achieved. In the eastward transmission of vinaya dharma, the Ten-Recitation was first. Next, in the twelfth year of Hongshi, year Gengxu, Buddhayaśas (meaning Enlightened Brightness) translated the original Four-Part Vinaya in forty-five volumes, later made into sixty volumes. In the eastern circulation of extensive vinayas, the Four-Part was second. In the fourteenth year of Yixi under Emperor An of Eastern Jin, year Wuwu, Tripiṭaka Master Buddhabhadra translated the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya in forty volumes. In the eastern transmission of vinaya dharma, this vinaya was third. In the first year of Jingping under Song, year Guihai, Buddhajīva translated the Five-Part Vinaya, completing thirty volumes. In the eastern transmission of extensive vinayas, the Five-Part was fourth. Among these four vinayas, Mahāsāṃghika is the root while the other three are branches. Of the five-school vinayas, three schools had already been transmitted. The Kāśyapīya school vinaya had only the prātimokṣa in one volume transmitted to China, which is the Liberation Prātimokṣa. It was translated in the first year of Wuding under Eastern Wei, year Guihai (corresponding to the ninth year of Datong under Liang, year Guihai of Emperor Kinmei of Japan), but the extensive vinaya was not transmitted. The Vātsīputrīya precepts and vinaya were never transmitted at all. For explaining the original vinayas, there are also vinaya treatises and Vinaya-mātṛkā, as previously listed by name. When the four vinayas were transmitted to the world, they were propagated immediately upon translation. The Ten-Recitation was extensively lectured, followed by propagation of the Four-Part, with Mahāsāṃghika and Five-Part being third in

lecture and dissemination. Although various vinayas were propagated, what greatly flourished in later generations was only the Four-Part Vinaya alone. Sixty-plus years after the Four-Part was translated, during the reign of Emperor Xiaowen, the sixth ruler of Yuan Wei, there was Vinaya Master Facong of the Northern Platform. Originally studying the Mahāsāṃghika and achieving penetrating refined research, when he thoroughly investigated initial ordination, since the school depended on Dharmaguptaka, he later lectured on the Four-Part, pioneering this previously untrodden path. Ordination and practice guidelines harmonized, with matters converging to unity. However, this was oral transmission, not yet recorded in written documents. Regarding the establishment of founding masters of the Four-Part Vinaya school, Song dynasty masters had many different interpretations, but now I clarify this following the Great Wisdom Vinaya Master. The Tathāgata was the great master who opened the dharma. From Kāśyapa onward were the founding masters of propagation and transmission, continuing to Upagupta. Different streams had not yet divided, and all schools used them in common. This one school now takes the vinaya master as the beginning, establishing nine patriarchs to clarify the matter of transmission succession. First is Venerable Dharmasoṇa, who is the vinaya master. Second is Venerable Dharma-time, the founding patriarch of initial ordination and initial transmission in the Divine Continent. Third is Vinaya Master Facong, who first lectured on the Four-Part. Fourth is Vinaya Master Daofu, who first composed commentaries. Fifth is Vinaya Master Huiguang, sixth is Vinaya Master Daoyun, seventh is Vinaya Master Daohong, eighth is Vinaya Master Zhishou, ninth is the Nanshan Vinaya Master. The high patriarch's name was Daoxuan, with natural spiritual brilliance, achieved awakening and upright virtue. In the eleventh year of Daye under Sui, year Yihai, at the full age of twenty (corresponding to the twenty-third year of Empress Suiko, the thirty-fourth sovereign of Japan), he received full ordination from Vinaya Master Shou. During the Wude period of Great Tang, he listened to vinaya teachings from Shou twenty times, also mastering sutras and treatises, extensively researching both Mahayana and Hinayana, comprehensively grasping inner and outer [teachings], thoroughly penetrating sacred and conventional [truths]. His conduct was lofty as peaceful clarity, his virtue profound as vast seas. Responding to birth in the five turbidities, he continued the traces of the four reliances. The five schools shone together, reflecting light across nine generations. He composed three volumes of excerpts that outshone ancient and modern works, and produced two commentaries that corrected right and wrong. With the Meaning Excerpts and Nun Excerpts, he benefited both monks and nuns equally. Through true realization and awakened understanding, he exhausted the subtle mysteries of

profound depths. His protection of dharma and promotion of blessings encompassed everything without omission. His spiritual responses excelled through a thousand ages, his guidance influenced ten thousand generations. His laudatory collections, ritual observations, biographical records, commentaries and excerpts totaled over two hundred volumes. His compositions were diverse and his propagation increasingly vast. When Xuanzang translated sutras, [Daoxuan] participated in the translation bureau. Indian monks called him the "Bodhisattva of the Eastern Land." Vinaya Master Zhishou established the division of five schools, pioneering propagation and transmission, but matters had not yet become thoroughly widespread. When it came to the age of Great Master Nanshan's guidance and maintenance, competition flourished daily, universal propagation became extensively developed, the Dharmarakṣa precept school spread widely according to the times, and the Dharmasoṇa vinaya gate opened as conditions arose. This was due to the great master vinaya lord's power of guidance and control. The great master's vinaya rules exclusively honored the Four-Part, his treatise doctrine encompassed two schools, his sutras were the Lotus and Nirvana, his classifications followed the three contemplations doctrinal school. In general, he grasped the great framework of eighty thousand [teachings], and specifically occupied the supreme position of one school. His concurrent orthodox propagation had good reason. In the second year of Qianfeng, year Dingmao, on the third day of the tenth month, he passed away while seated peacefully (corresponding to the sixth year Dingmao under Emperor Tenji, the thirty-ninth sovereign of Japan). He lived seventy-two years with fifty-two years in the saṃgha. Regarding the Four-Part Vinaya collection, although there were many commentary schools, the works produced by three masters were universally praised and admired throughout the world. First was Guangtong's Abbreviated Commentary in four volumes, second was Zhishou's Extensive Commentary in twenty volumes, third was Fali's Middle Commentary in ten volumes, called the Three Essential Commentaries, which everyone studied, practiced, and used. Long ago, under Daoyun's school there were two outstanding worthies: Hongzun and Daohong. Fazun, Hongyuan, Fali, and Daocheng continued this succession. Under Daocheng's school were Manyi and Huaisu, each establishing their own school groups that spread in later generations. Daohong, Zhishou, and Nanshan continued this succession, which flourished even more in later generations. However, Four-Part Vinaya doctrine divided into three schools: Xiangbu school, Nanshan school, and Dongta school. Scholars of the three schools engaged in debates without cessation. After the Eikyō years, the Dongta New Commentary flourished in the world. Vinaya Master Fashen received ordination from Daocheng and studied vinaya

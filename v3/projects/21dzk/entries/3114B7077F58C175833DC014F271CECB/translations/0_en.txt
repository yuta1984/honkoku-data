Regarding the text stating that one is inferior because unable to achieve the Perfect Ocean (Enkai), the Great Master's commentary states: "The virtue of the Perfect Ocean refers to all Buddhas, which is the self-nature Dharma body." Nāgārjuna's commentary states: "Although Vairocana Buddha encompasses the three worlds, he encompasses both encompassing and non-encompassing." Both sutras and treatises state that "Vairocana does not encompass the Dharma body," so why contradict that sincere teaching and rashly create such interpretations? If one points to Mahāvairocana and calls him the original teacher, that meaning would be correct. Exoteric and esoteric teachings have superiority and inferiority; emanation and sudden manifestation appear similar. If the Dharma body emanates the thirty-seven honored ones and "the hundred thousand Buddhas are all my original teacher, suddenly manifested and encompassed by the ocean-seal," then using the Vajra Peak Sutra seems to encompass the initial Avatamsaka. This probably resembles how Master Guangxiu of Folong Chan Temple on Tiantai Mountain and Abbot Weijuan of Guoqing Temple on the same mountain judged the Mahāvairocana Sutra as belonging to the Vaipulya section. Avatamsaka and Vaipulya are teachings of responsive manifestations, while Mahāvairocana and Vajra discuss the principle-Buddha wisdom body. Their superiority and inferiority are vastly separated; how could they mutually encompass each other? Although the Prajñā and other sutras explain the six elements, these are conditioned and impermanent dharmas, not the essence of Buddha-nature. Moreover, the six elements are not all creative principles. If one claims they are the same based on having the same names, then since the Abhidharmakośa explains the six realms, one would have to say that even Hinayana teaches the inherent six elements. The Great Master states: "Exoteric teachings regard the four elements as non-sentient, while esoteric teaching explains these as the Tathāgata's samaya body." Although exoteric teachings clarify the principle of the four elements as creative, only material dharmas are creative, while mental dharmas do not create, much less unconditioned dharmas. The present meaning is not like this. Therefore, the Great Master's commentary states: "Whether ascending to the Dharma body or descending to the six realms, although there are distinctions of coarse and subtle, they still do not transcend the six elements. Therefore, the Buddha taught the six elements as the essence of the dharma-realm." Thus, the six elements of each are completely different.

Explanation of Similarities and Differences in Various Schools' Doctrines (End)

Completed on the first day of the second month of Kenji 2 (1276). Although I hesitate to judge the principles of the five schools with my inferior wisdom, I could not disobey my superior's command and merely compiled this single chapter.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Compiled by Monk Shiren of Saihoku
　　　Abhidharmakośa School
The Abhidharmakośa School takes the Abhidharmakośa treatise as its foundation. It arose in the Indus region 400 years after the Buddha's death, when 500 arhats, at the request of King Kaniṣka, composed a 200-volume treatise - the Mahāvibhāṣā. 900 years after the death, Bodhisattva Vasubandhu compiled the profound meanings of the 200-volume Vibhāṣā, first creating thirty volumes of verses - the Abhidharmakośa root verses. Its transmission to China occurred during the reign of Emperor Taizong, the second Tang emperor, when Tripitaka Master Xuanzang traveled to India and brought back the Yogācāra treatise, Vijñānavāda treatise, and Abhidharmakośa treatise. Its transmission to Japan occurred during the reign of Empress Kōgyoku, the 36th sovereign, when two monks, Chitsu and Chitatsu, received imperial permission to enter Tang China, met Tripitaka Master Xuanzang, studied the Abhidharmakośa school, and returned to Japan. Another account states that during the reign of Empress Genshō, the 44th sovereign, Monk Genbō of Nanto entered Tang China, and this school first began in Japan. At that time, Tōdaiji, Mii, and Enryakuji studied it.

　　　Satyasiddhi School
The Satyasiddhi School is based on the Satyasiddhi treatise. It first arose in the Indus region 900 years after the Buddha's death, when Harivarman Tripitaka, a disciple of Kumāralāta, appeared in the world. Initially a Hinayana practitioner, he later converted to Mahayana and composed a treatise as repentance - the present Satyasiddhi treatise. Its introduction to China occurred during the Eastern Jin under Emperor An, when Tripitaka Master Kumārajīva from Kucha in the Indus region brought seventy-four sutras and treatises from Western Heaven, including the Satyasiddhi treatise. Its transmission to Japan occurred during the reign of Empress Suiko, the 34th sovereign, when Dharma Master Dōshō entered Tang China, met Tripitaka Master Xuanzang, transmitted this treatise, and returned to Japan. This was the beginning of this school's introduction. Another account states that during Suiko's reign, Monk Kanroku brought the Satyasiddhi treatise from Baekje. Tōdaiji and Enryakuji studied it.

　　　Vinaya School
The Vinaya School regards keeping the precepts as essential practice. It first arose in the Indus region after the Buddha's death, when Venerable Upāli ascended the high seat eighty times during one summer retreat of ninety days to recite the Vinaya Piṭaka taught by the Tathāgata - this is the root text of the Eighty Recitations Vinaya. Its transmission to China occurred during the Later Qin under Emperor An, when Tripitaka Master Puṇyatāra from Kashmir translated the Ten Recitations Vinaya in fifty-eight volumes and the Four-Part Vinaya in sixty volumes at the royal capital monastery. Later in India, there were the Five-Part Vinayas. Vinaya Master Daoxuan of Nanshan received this school and flourished the Three Great Sections. In Tenpyō-shōhō year of kinoe-uma (754), Master Jianzhen of Qinglong Temple, a disciple-grandson of Nanshan, transmitted it to Japan. He established a precept platform at Tōdaiji in the left capital of Nanto and built Tōshōdaiji in the right capital. Regarding the Northern Capital Vinaya, in Kenkyū 5 (1194), Dharma Master Shunjō, founder of Sennyūji, entered Song China and transmitted the Vinaya teachings.

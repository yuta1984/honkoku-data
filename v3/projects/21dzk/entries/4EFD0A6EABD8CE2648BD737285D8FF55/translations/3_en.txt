clearly perceived Genku's (Honen's) innermost thoughts. Therefore there is the guidance in the Kaimoku-sho {Note: Final volume, 51 - Like deceiving a madman into abandoning treasures. And so on. Contemplate this passage deeply.}

○The Senjaku-shu, Volume 1 {Note: Beginning} says: "Master Daochuo established the two gates of the sage path and Pure Land, abandoning the sage path and correctly returning to the Pure Land. {Note: To here} I {Note: Honen} privately say: Regarding the first sage path gate, there are two aspects: first is Mahayana, second is Hinayana. Within Mahayana, though there are differences of exoteric-esoteric and provisional-true, the intention of this Anraku-shu (Collection of Peace and Bliss) only preserves exoteric Mahayana and provisional Mahayana. Therefore it corresponds to practices that take kalpas and follow circuitous paths. Considering this standard, one should preserve esoteric Mahayana and true Mahayana. Therefore the intentions of these eight schools - present-day Shingon, Busshin, Tendai, Kegon, Sanron, Hosso, Jiron, and Shoron - are precisely here." {Note: Text}

The same {Note: 5} says: "Generally, establishing the two gates of sage path and Pure Land in this collection is intended to make people abandon the sage path and enter the Pure Land." {Note: Text}

△The Treatise on Protecting the Nation {Note: 28, quoting the Senjaku} says: "The intention of Daochuo's Anraku-shu, though establishing the two gates of sage path and Pure Land regarding the Mahayana and Hinayana sutras before the Lotus, {Note: Honen} privately equated the true great and esoteric great of the Lotus, Shingon, etc. with the provisional Mahayana of the forty-plus years, calling it the sage path gate - these are the four characters 'considering this standard.' Based on this intention, when quoting Tanluan's difficult and easy two paths, he also privately placed the Lotus and Shingon within the difficult practice path. Generally, the Senjaku-shu, spanning sixteen sections, becomes the source of immeasurable dharma slander, arising entirely from these four characters. How mistaken! How fearful!" {Note: Text} {Note: The master says: Our patriarch's refutation of various schools also necessarily has its sequence. For instance, regarding the refutation of the Pure Land school, initially he did not refute its patriarch but only the later streams, as in the Summary of the Great Intention of One Lifetime. In the middle period, he did not refute the three Chinese masters but only Honen, as in the National Treatise. Later he refuted them all, as in the Pure Circle Collection and the Ankoku-ron, etc. This should be considered.}

○The Senjaku-shu, final volume {Note: 14} in the passage permitting birth through various practices says: {Note: Contemplation Sutra, Three Blessings} "The sutra says: First, filial care for parents, serving teachers and elders, compassionate non-killing, and cultivating the ten good karmas. Second, receiving and maintaining the three refuges, fulfilling all precepts, and not violating proper conduct. Third, generating bodhi mind, deeply believing in cause and effect, reciting Mahayana sutras, and encouraging practitioners. {Note: Opening these three blessings into the nine grades of karma}" Up to the Zhenyuan Catalog of Sutras Entering the Canon, beginning with the 600-volume Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and ending with the Dharma Eternal Sutra - exoteric and esoteric Mahayana sutras totaling 637 works in 2,883 volumes - all should be included in the single phrase "reciting Mahayana sutras."

Question: Among the pre-Lotus sutras, how is the Lotus included? Answer: What I call "inclusion" here does not discuss the doctrines of provisional-true or partial-complete. The phrase "reciting Mahayana sutras" commonly applies to all Mahayana sutras before and after. "Before" refers to all Mahayana sutras before the Contemplation Sutra. "After" refers to all Mahayana sutras after the royal palace period. Simply calling them "Mahayana" without selecting between provisional and true, they properly correspond to the various Mahayana sutras of Avatamsaka, Vaipulya, Prajna, Lotus, Nirvana, etc." {Note: Text}

○The same work {Note: 4 sheets} says: "Regarding the gate of birth in the Pure Land, there are two aspects: first, sutras that directly explain birth in the Pure Land; {Note: Investigation - the Sutra Collection writes "teaching"} second, teachings that indirectly explain birth in the Pure Land. The first, teachings directly explaining birth in the Pure Land, refers to the three sutras and one treatise. Sometimes pointing to these three sutras, they are called the Three Pure Land Sutras. {Note: To here} These are the primary scriptural basis for birth. Next, teachings indirectly explaining birth in the Pure Land are the various sutras like Avatamsaka, Lotus, Su求, and Zunsheng that explain various Pure Land births. Also,

【Page 7, Upper Section】
the Awakening of Faith, True Nature Treatise, Ten Stages Vibhasha, Mahayanasamgraha, etc. are the various treatises that explain various Pure Land births." {Note: Text}

○The Contemplation Dharma Gate {Note: 8 sheets} says: "The Infinite Life Sutra, Sixteen Contemplation Sutra, Four-sheet Amitabha Sutra, Pratyutpanna Samadhi Sutra, Ten Births Sutra, Pure Land Samadhi Sutra - respectfully following Shakyamuni Buddha's teachings and the six Pure Land birth sutras, etc." {Note: Text}

○The Senjaku-shu, Volume 1 {Note: 44 sheets} says: "Nembutsu practitioners must possess the three minds." {Note: Text} The Commentary on the Contemplation Sutra says: {Note: 56 sheets} "When it speaks of 'practicing one or two parts when bandits call back,' this metaphorically refers to people of different understandings, different practices, and evil views who falsely expound interpretations, mutually confusing each other, and creating karma themselves and falling back." {Note: Above commentary text} I {Note: Honen} privately say: {Note: 59 sheets} "Here when it speaks of 'all different understandings, different practices, different schools, different views, etc.,' it points to the understanding, practice, study, and views of the sage path gate." {Note: Text}

△The Crushing the Heretical Wheel, final volume {Note: 26 sheets} says: "Though Daochuo established the two gates of sage path and Pure Land, he did not speak of 'different understandings and different practices.' Though Shandao spoke of 'different understandings and different practices,' he added the words 'destructive, disturbing, heretical, miscellaneous, evil views' to distinguish them, making clear that people of correct understanding and correct practice do not constitute obstacles. However, you, regarding Daochuo's two gates, added the words 'understanding, practice, study, and views,' brought out Shandao's people of different understandings and different practices, and deleted the characters for 'heretical' and 'evil.' In Shandao's commentary, metaphorically comparing evil-viewed people to bandits, to say this points to the understanding, practice, study, and views of the sage path gate - is this not saying that except for Amitabha Buddha's birth sutras, all exoteric and esoteric Three Jewels are made into bandits? {Note: To here} Generally, the grave transgression of great evil views is inconceivable, inconceivable.

You are not only insufficient to be a guide for nembutsu practitioners, but additionally become an evil friend to nembutsu practitioners." {Note: Text}

○The Anraku-shu, final volume {Note: 23 sheets} says: "Comparing the two Buddhas Amitabha and Shakyamuni: This Buddha Shakyamuni Tathagata resided in the world for eighty years, appeared briefly and immediately departed. Having departed, he does not return here. Even in the Trayastrimsha heavens, not even one day." {Note: Text}

△The Lotus Sutra says: "I am constantly in this Saha world teaching and converting, and also in other places - hundreds of thousands of millions of nayutas of asamkhya lands - leading and benefiting sentient beings," etc. {Note: Text}

△The Nirvana Sutra {Note: Four Noble Truths Chapter, Commentary Volume 7, part 19} says: "If one can know that the Tathagata is constantly present without change, or hearing the sound of the two characters 'eternal abiding,' if it once passes through the ear, one is immediately born in heaven, and later at the time of liberation, one can then realize the Tathagata's eternal abiding without change." {Note: Text}

○The Profound Meaning 3 {Note: 23 sheets} says: "This is opening the provisional and revealing the true - all the coarse becomes the wonderful absolute wonder. If as explained above, the Lotus comprehensively encompasses all sutras, and the matter culminates here. This is the Buddha's original intention in appearing in the world, the ultimate destination of all doctrinal teachings. If people do not see this principle, considering it to be conditional phenomenal appearances, their contempt does not cease, and their tongues rot in their mouths." {Note: Text}

○Miaole's Annotation 3 {Note: 52} "Like Dharma Master Song of Pengcheng Temple saying: When Buddha wisdom flows and moves to impermanence, when the tongue rots in the mouth, still not changing one's resolve. Also as the Great Sutra Volume 5 {Note: Four Characteristics Chapter} says: 'I now for all voice-hearers and disciples explain the Vigrahavyakarana, namely that the Tathagata eternally exists without

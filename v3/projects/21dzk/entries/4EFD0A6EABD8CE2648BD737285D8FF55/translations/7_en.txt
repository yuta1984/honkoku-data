The sutra says: 'My land is not destroyed and always exists on Vulture Peak.' How could one leave Gaya and separately seek eternal tranquility? There is no separate saha world outside of the tranquil light." {Note: Text}

△The Treatise on Protecting the Nation {Note: 61 sheets} says: "The pure lands before [the Lotus Sutra] are pure lands manifested by Shakyamuni Tathagata of eternal original enlightenment, but in reality they are all defiled lands. {Note: Until} When reaching the Lifespan chapter and establishing the true pure land, this land is immediately established as the pure land. However, regarding the ten difficulties of Tushita and Amitabha's land, without changing the previous designations, names like Tushita and Amitabha's land are applied to this land. For example, although this sutra has the names of three vehicles, there are no three vehicles. Therefore, there is no need to further point to the Contemplation Sutra, etc. This is the meaning of the commentary." {Note: Text}

△The same {Note: 18-9 sheets} says: "The Western Pure Land is recommended by many sutras because it neighbors the saha world, because it is the lowest pure land, and because the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Consequently, it is not only the Pure Land patriarchs who exclusively recommend this teaching. Tiantai, Miaole, etc., also following the pre-Lotus sutras, have this tendency. It is also not just individual masters. Nagarjuna and Vasubandhu also had this understanding. This is one interpretation." {Note: Text}

△The Commentary Record on Text and Meaning 10 {Note: 62} says: "After the Buddha entrusted [the dharma] and the great work was completed, because of beings' particular preferences, the various vehicles differ. True suchness and ultimate reality are the principle to be mounted. The cause and effect of the one vehicle are the phenomena to be mounted. Ascetic practices, etc. {Note: Taking the samadhi vehicles of Wonderful Sound and Universal Gate, dharani vehicles, solemn king vow vehicles, Samantabhadra supernatural power vehicles, etc.} are the conditions for these vehicles. Because they follow beings' capacities and circumstances, they cause those who propagate [the dharma] to differ according to conditions. Therefore, the essence of what is mounted is all the wonderful dharma." {Note: Text}

△Eshin's Brief Essentials of Mind-Contemplation says: "'At the end of this life' means ending one's life of evil karma through practicing the Lotus. 'Immediately going to the Land of Peace and Bliss' means dwelling in peaceful and blissful practice. Peaceful and blissful practice is the practice of the Lotus Sutra.

'Being born in lotus flowers' means being born into understanding principle and entering the dharma gate of the Wonderful Lotus Sutra." {Note: Text}

△Our high patriarch appeared in a corrupt age to propagate the absolute dharma. However, when it comes to discussing proper standards, it becomes the true intent of the relative. Therefore, our patriarch's judgments frequently prohibit similar slander of the dharma. Record volumes 30 {Note: 31}, same 31 {Note: 69}, 26 {Note: 49}, etc. These should be taken as excellent models. The Manjushri Inquiry Sutra says: "All heavenly spirits should be worshipped. All forest trees should be worshipped. All mountain spirits should be worshipped. All ancient dwelling places should be worshipped. All large trees should be worshipped. All various divine images should be worshipped. Maheshvara, Vishnu, Kumara, Brahma, Yama King, dragons, Vaishravana, Indra {Note: until}." This resembles wrong views. These should be abandoned and not worshipped. {Note: Above, abbreviated quotation} Enshō says: "Our school prohibits similar slander of the dharma precisely based on this sutra. Some people say 'Entering is also home, leaving is also home - what could be wrong with this?' This is a poisonous arrow that misleads oneself and others."

○The Infinite Life Sutra Ritual Manual {Note: Amoghavajra} says: "Formerly on Vulture Peak named Wonderful Dharma, now in the West named Amitabha, in the defiled world of the final age named Avalokiteshvara. The benefits of the three periods are the same one body." {Note: Text}

The Mahasthamaprapta Sutra says: "For forty years I have taught the Pure Land dharma gate." {Note: Text}

○The Nirvana Commentary says: "Between the two places of the Lotus and Nirvana, now [the Buddha] went to [teach] the Contemplation Sutra." {Note: Text}

The third patriarch of Huayan, National Master Fazang's Treatise on Excellent Views says: "After the Lotus, at the beginning of the Nirvana, between these two places are the Contemplation Sutra, etc." {Note: Text}

【Page 15, Upper Section】
○Text and Meaning 2 {Note: 74 sheets} says: "The Universal Transcendence Sutra, Chapter 3 on Resolving Doubts says: Ajatashatru repented to Manjushri and attained patient acceptance. At death he entered Binjara Hell, immediately entering and immediately exiting, was born in Buddha lands of the upper directions, and attained the tolerance of non-arising. When Maitreya appears in the world, he will return to this realm named Immovable Bodhisattva. Later he will become Buddha titled Pure Realm Tathagata. Since his trace is thus, how can his original [nature] be measured? When the Lotus was taught, he joined the pure assembly; when the time of nirvana came, he guided those with transgressive sins. How is this different from Kashyapa receiving prediction in the Lotus but being unable to bear the entrustment in the Nirvana? One should not be confused by traces and doubt the fundamental. In contemplative interpretation: the mother of greed and love, the father of uselessness - harming them is called transgression. Transgression is immediately accordance. Practicing the non-path, one penetrates to the Buddha path." {Note: Text}

○Record 2 {Note: 79 sheets} says: "When the Lotus was taught: based on attaining patient acceptance, because it was before the Lotus, he was among the pure assembly at the Lotus. When the time of nirvana came, his bodily sores first appeared and through repentance he attained the first fruit. Therefore we know this was only to guide those with transgressive sins. This entirely makes it an interpretation of great expedient means. Therefore Kashyapa is cited as an example." {Note: Text}

△The Contemplation of Infinite Life Sutra {Note: Illustrated Sutra, middle 7} says: "At that time in the great city of Rajagriha, there was a prince named Ajatashatru. Following the teachings of the evil friend Devadatta, he seized his father King Bimbisara and confined him in a seven-layered chamber." {Note: Text}

△Tied Jewels 5 {Note: 18 sheets} says: "Ryōchū's Essential Collection of the Pure Land School {Note: 5, 26} calculates the time when the Contemplation Sutra was taught. Some, following the Treatise on Excellent Views, [say it was] simultaneous with the Lotus. Others cite the Nirvana [Sutra], [placing it] between the Lotus and Nirvana.

{Note: And so on} I examine their intent and fear this is a stubborn argument of treacherous scheming that cuts off all expedient sutras with one stroke, wanting to leap out of the age limit of forty-plus years and rush beyond the boundaries of 'not yet revealing the truth.' Even if the Contemplation Sutra was taught simultaneously with or after the Lotus, since the Lotus Sutra transcends the three teachings, if that sutra is not among the 'already taught,' it should be among the 'now or future teachings.' It can never escape from within the net of the three teachings. How could it be freed from the domain of 'not yet revealing the truth'? Miaole's Commentary Record {Note: 6, 36} says: 'Even if there are sutras called "king of sutras," if they do not say "supreme among already taught, now teaching, and future teachings," the meaning of "concurrent, exclusive, contrasting, and inclusive" can be understood.' {Note: Above} If called simultaneous teaching, it is included in the 'now teaching according to others' capacities.' If called later teaching, it is included in the 'future teaching according to others' capacities.' Now, correctly following and conforming to the sutra commentaries, I show that the Contemplation Sutra was taught before the Lotus, definitely not after. First, the Contemplation Sutra speaks of 'prince,' the Lotus speaks of 'King Ajatashatru.' Therefore we know the distinction between earlier and later teaching is truly clear. Shandao's commentary on the sutra says {Note: Meaning of the Introductory Section, 27 sheets}: 'Prince clarifies his position.' {Note: Above} Second, the Lotus says 'Ajatashatru, son of Vaidehi.' When reaching the Lotus assembly, since it was after the father king was murdered, the mother is mentioned to indicate the son. However, at the time of the Contemplation Sutra, the father king was still alive but confined. Therefore we know the Contemplation Sutra was earlier, the Lotus later - as clear as looking at the bright sun. Third, at the time of the Contemplation Sutra, Devadatta was present, teaching transgression to the prince. By the time of the Lotus, Devadatta had fallen into Avici Hell and received a prediction. This clearly shows the Contemplation Sutra was earlier, the Lotus later. Fourth, at the time of the Contemplation Sutra, Ajatashatru was actively committing transgressive sins. In the Lotus he was properly among the assembled audience. The Lotus Sutra says: 'King Ajatashatru, together with several hundred thousand retainers, each paid homage at the Buddha's feet and withdrew to sit to one side.' Tiantai

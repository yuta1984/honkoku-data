practices" to clarify the "five types of mixed practices."" {Note: Text}

○The same, lower {Note: 8 right} says: "For the extremely evil and lowest people, [we] teach the extremely good and highest dharma. For example, just as that useless deep-rooted illness cannot be cured unless it is with the medicine from the treasury of the middle way, this deep-rooted severe illness of the five grave sins is also the treasury of the spiritual medicine of nembutsu. Without this medicine, how could this illness be cured?" {Note: Text} The Nōha-shibon volume {Note: 26 sheets} cites the Contemplation Sutra, etc. {Note: And so on}

○The same, lower {Note: 21 sheets} says: "Moreover, [the Buddha] taught meditative and non-meditative [practices] to reveal that nembutsu surpasses other good deeds. If there were no meditative and non-meditative practices, how would the special excellence of nembutsu be revealed? For example, just as the Lotus excels above the three teachings - if there were no three teachings, how would the supremacy of the Lotus be revealed? Therefore, the various good deeds of meditative and non-meditative practices are taught in order to be abandoned, while nembutsu samadhi is taught in order to be established." {Note: Text}

△The Chūshō-ron 9 {Note: 78 sheets} says: "The text 'single-minded exclusive recitation of Amitayus Buddha' in the Contemplation Sutra is not the meaning of restraining various practices. It only teaches the depth of faith-mind in taking refuge in Buddha. Why? Although the text on the three grades of rebirth in the Contemplation Sutra all contain the words 'single-minded exclusive recitation,' in the superior grade there are monastic practices, the virtue of arousing bodhi-mind, and it teaches cultivating various merits. How could the words 'cultivating various' not include the practices of various teachings? Know that the words 'single-minded' do not mean abandoning other practices. Also in the middle grade, there are also practices of arousing bodhi-mind, teaching various good roots, and there are merit fields such as giving, precepts, building stupas, etc. Although the text on the lower grade does not mention cultivated good roots, it has the words 'should arouse the mind of supreme bodhi.' This is precisely the practice of bodhi. Also it says 'if hearing the profound dharma with joy and faithful delight' - is this not the practice of hearing dharma and upholding it?

【Page 12, Lower Section】
From this we know that both middle and lower grades do not mean abandoning other practices to engage in single-minded nembutsu. This only teaches deep faithful refuge in Buddha. If it were as Hōnen established, then how could the various texts on the three grades be understood? Clearly know that Hōnen violates the purport of the single-minded exclusive recitation text." {Note: Text}

△Hōnen sometimes permits various sutras and various practices. {Note: This Selection Collection {Note: 9 right}} There are generally four meanings: First, following the two good practices of meditative and non-meditative in the Contemplation Sutra, he permits them provisionally, but actually does not permit them. Second, he permits them for superior capacities. {Note: Ōhara Debate} Third, he permits them as auxiliary conditions for rebirth. Fourth, he permits them for prayers in the present world. {Note: Hōnen's Biography}

△The Adorning Record of Refuting Heretical Wheels {Note: 11 left} says: "Speaking generally, if what your heretical collection establishes accords with one sutra, one treatise, one text, one meaning, why would I judge it as heretical doctrine? In the Buddha-dharma there are absolutely none of your heretical words. [Your teachings] clearly violate the doctrines and principles. It would be difficult to point them out one by one. I just raise the main points, and other meanings can be considered accordingly." {Note: Text}

△The Ankoku-ron {Note: 15 sheets} says: "Although I am of small capacity, I humbly study the Mahayana. Like a blue fly attached to a fine horse's tail crossing ten thousand li, or green vines hanging from pine tops extending a thousand fathoms. This disciple was born as a child of one Buddha and serves the king of sutras. How could I see the decline of Buddha-dharma and not arouse heartfelt sorrow and regret? Moreover, the Nirvana Sutra says: 'If a good monk sees those who destroy the dharma but does not rebuke, expel, or expose them, know that this person is an enemy within the Buddha-dharma. If he can expel, rebuke, and expose them, this is my disciple, a true voice-hearer.' Although I am not a good monk, in order to escape the blame of being an enemy within the Buddha-dharma, I only grasp the main points and roughly show one aspect." {Note: Etc., text}

【Page 13, Upper Section】
○The Rebirth Ritual Praise {Note: 33 sheets} says: "Also, as the Infinite Life Sutra says: 'If I become Buddha, may the sentient beings of the ten directions who recite my name, down to ten recitations, be reborn [in my land]. If not, may I not attain perfect enlightenment.' That Buddha is now present in the world having achieved Buddhahood. We should know that the original vow and solemn promise is not in vain. If sentient beings recite [his name], they will certainly attain rebirth." {Note: Text}

△The Chūshō-ron presents ten types of Amitabha. See previous [discussions]. Now, following the old text, I present three types {Note: Adding private notes}:

Former Amitabha│Explained in the Drum-Sound Dharani Sutra. The country is named Pure Peace, the father is named Moon-Superior Wheel-Turning Holy King, the mother is named Supremely Excellent Wonderful Countenance, the son is named Moon Bright. The serving disciple is named Stainless Excellence, the wisdom disciple is named Stirring Light, the supernatural power disciple is named Great Transformation, the demon is named Invincible, the Devadatta is named Tranquil. This is when Shakyamuni was in Campa city teaching the Drum-Sound Dharani, citing the verification of nembutsu practitioners.

△The Infinite Life Sutra says: In the distant past kalpa, at the place of World-Sovereign King Buddha, the monk Dharmakara made forty-eight vows, achieved perfect enlightenment ten kalpas ago, established a land in the west, and was named Tathagata Amitabha. {Note: Recorded with the essential meaning} The sutra's exact text says: "Ananda addressed the Buddha: 'Has Bodhisattva Dharmakara already become Buddha and passed into nirvana, or has he not yet become Buddha, or is he presently [existing]?' The Buddha told Ananda: 'Bodhisattva Dharmakara has now already become Buddha and presently exists in the west, ten trillion Buddha-lands from here. That Buddha world is called Land of Peace and Bliss.' Ananda again asked: 'Since that Buddha achieved enlightenment, how much time has passed?' The Buddha said: 'Since becoming Buddha, altogether ten kalpas have passed.'" {Note: Text}

【Page 13, Lower Section】
Trace-gate Amitabha│This is explained in the Lotus Sutra Chapter 3, Parable of the Phantom City. When the father, Buddha Great Universal Wisdom Excellence, had not yet left home, he had sixteen sons. The ninth prince achieved Buddhahood three thousand dust-particle kalpas ago, established a land in the west, and vowed "to always joyfully teach this Wonderful Lotus Sutra." The Infinite Meaning Sutra says: "Although the words and phrases are the same, the meanings are each different." {Note: Text}

○The Profound Meaning 10 {Note: 45 sheets} says: "The written words are the same, yet the meanings are distinctly different." {Note: Text}

Original-gate Amitabha│The Lotus Sutra Chapter 7, Medicine King chapter explains: If women in the defiled world hear this sutra and practice as taught, at the end of this life they immediately go to the Land of Peace and Bliss where Amitabha dwells and are born on lotus flowers. This is teaching after the original [Buddha] was revealed, therefore both body and land are superior. Compared to the previous trace-gate [teachings], they are separated like clouds and earth.

○The Commentary Record on the Text and Meaning 10 {Note: 69} says: "'If there are women' etc. - here it only says 'obtaining to hear this sutra and practicing as taught is immediately the cause of the pure land,' without needing to further point to the Contemplation Sutra, etc. Question: How does one practice? Answer: Since it says 'practice as taught,' one establishes practice according to the sutra. It is detailed as in the Chapter on Distinguishing Merits. Directly contemplating this land, the four lands are complete. Therefore this Buddha body is precisely the three bodies. Therefore this great assembly is precisely all beings. Because delusions are not yet cut off. Therefore the peaceful and blissful practice is the essence of the pure land of common residence. Therefore, without leaving the defiled [land] of common residence, one sees the pure [land] of common residence." {Note: Text}

△The same 9 {Note: end-beginning} says: "This saha [world] is precisely the land where the original response-body dwells. Today's trace-dwelling does not move from the original. Only the times of now and past are different. Those who see burning consider it near; those who illuminate the original understand it as distant. Therefore

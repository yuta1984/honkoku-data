Although mu (nothingness) is quiescence, if one does not cultivate the Way, there is no means to achieve spiritual union. Therefore it says "Buddha-son" - meaning Buddha.

△The Commentary (Shuiki) Volume 9 states: Question: All sutras, even grass and trees, have principle that is without inequality. Why only the Lotus Sutra? Answer: The similarities and differences of teachings are as explained in the Profound Text (Genmon). Although all principles are the same, the explanation is found in this sutra. What is praised here praises the teaching that can express [truth]. Therefore it is not found in other sutras.

△The Extensive Decisions (Kōketsu) Volume 4 states: The Sutra of Non-Action in All Directions explains "desire is the Way," but this merely says that the nature of the Way does not transcend desire, and also that the nature of desire does not separate from the Way. Regarding principle, one speaks of "immediate," but regarding phenomena, one must separate.

○The Treatise on Orthodox Transmission of Dharma states: In ancient times, Master Zhiyi of the Sui dynasty was most knowledgeable about teachings.

△The Great Calming and Contemplation Volume 10 states: Those who practice evil cling to teachings from the Mahayana that "greed is immediately the Way" and that "the three poisons contain all Buddha-dharmas." Though these true words originally aimed to eliminate afflictions, they grasp them incorrectly and instead generate karmic bonds, competing for fame and profit through praise, slander, worry, love, deception, arrogance, and clamor.

○The Nirvana Sutra states: When the mind creates good karma, one's own body becomes a wise friend. When the mind creates evil karma, one's own body becomes an enemy.

○The same [sutra] states: Vow to become master of the mind, not to make the mind your master. If you wish to attain the non-retreating bodhisattva [stage], you should make this vow.

○The Sutra of Mindfulness of True Dharma records a hell-guard rebuking a sinner: "Mind is the foremost enemy. This enemy is most evil. This enemy can bind people and send them to Yama's realm. When you alone are burned in hell and consumed by evil karma, wives, children, brothers, and relatives cannot save you."

○The Laṅkāvatāra Sutra Volume 3 (Chapter on All Buddha-Word-Mind, addressing Mahāmati) states: From the night I achieved enlightenment until the night of nirvana, in this interval between, I had nothing to say.

○It also states: From the night I attained supreme perfect enlightenment until the night I entered parinirvana, in this interval, I did not speak even a single word.

△The Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, "Chapter on Expounding Dharma," states: From when I first attained the Way and began expounding dharma until today when I expound the Mahayana Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, I have never failed to speak of suffering, emptiness, impermanence, non-self, neither true nor false, neither great nor small, originally unborn, now also not extinguished, one characteristic without characteristics, dharma-characteristic and dharma-nature, neither coming nor going. Yet all sentient beings are subject to the four characteristics of change.

△The Tendai Commentary states: "From when I attained the Way" refers to Śākyamuni's enlightenment. "First began expounding dharma" indicates the initial period of milk and cream. "Until today expounding the Mahayana Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings" clarifies the initial phase of ghee. From "never failed to speak" onward clarifies "not speaking a single word." This is precisely the meaning of the "two nights" sutra. "Yet all sentient beings are subject to the four characteristics" clarifies teaching according to others' capacity. The character "not" (mi) should not be read with double inversion, like the character "should" (tō) in "should be" is not read with double inversion. [The Buddha] did not speak of suffering as true-suchness following conditions, did not speak of emptiness as true-suchness following conditions, did not speak of impermanence as following conditions, did not speak of non-self as following conditions, did not speak of partial truth as non-true, did not speak of dependent nature as non-false, did not speak of provisional great as non-great, did not speak of provisional small as non-small, did not speak of mind-nature

**Page 37 Upper Section**
[continuing from previous] as originally unborn, did not speak of mind-nature as now also not extinguished, did not speak of the one characteristic of the Middle, did not speak of the no-characteristics of Emptiness, did not speak of the dharma-characteristics of the Provisional, did not speak of the dharma-nature of One Mind, did not speak of the non-coming of One Mind, did not speak of the non-going of One Mind. Nevertheless, following sentient beings subject to the four characteristics of birth and so forth, [the Buddha] spoke of suffering, emptiness, etc. This is precisely the provisional teaching of the separate and sequential Three Truths. He had not yet expounded the true circular and harmonious Three Truths. Before the Lotus, for over forty years, the teachings of the four periods, four teachings and eight teachings, have been completed.

△The Extensive Decisions Volume 3 (evaluating the Laṅkāvatāra) states: It extensively discusses the Shared and Distinct [teachings] but little clarifies the Tripiṭaka and Perfect [teachings]. If discussing wisdom and practice, it generally encompasses the four teachings. This verifies that this collection clearly belongs to the Vaipulya period.

△The Explanatory Notes states: Worldly people judge the Laṅkāvatāra as either equivalent to the Avataṃsaka or equivalent to the Lotus. As in the Śamatha-vipaśyanā Commentary, there are already two places that quote Laṅkāvatāra passages and classify them as belonging to Vaipulya.

△The Extensive Decisions Volume 5 states: The seven emptinesses of the Laṅkāvatāra mostly belong to Tripiṭaka and Shared [teachings]. Because it speaks of being free from habitual faults in self-realization. Even if taken tolerantly, it slightly connects to Perfect and Distinct [teachings]. This should be considered together with Myōraku's citation.

△Myōraku said: "In explaining meaning, one must look to the original sutra." These words are complete. They should serve as a mirror for ten thousand generations. The Laṅkāvatāra Sutra that Bodhidharma relied upon contains teachings that intermingle the one-sided and perfect, great and small - it is provisional and coarse dharma. Therefore, viewing Bodhidharma's mind and vision through the original sutra reveals this view of separate, sequential, one-sided emptiness. Disputes also cease. The "expressible and inexpressible" - these two approaches generally apply to all the collections of teachings throughout [the Buddha's] lifetime. The Laṅkāvatāra's "not speaking a single word" and "not speaking two dharmas" merely indicate one aspect. Do not cling rigidly to this.

**Page 37 Lower Section**
△The Nirvana Sutra, "Chapter on King Virtue," states: The Buddha said: "Excellent, excellent, good man! Non-arising arising is inexpressible, arising arising is also inexpressible, arising non-arising is also inexpressible, non-arising non-arising is also inexpressible, arising is also inexpressible, non-arising is also inexpressible. Because there are causes and conditions, it can also be expressed." See Śamatha-vipaśyanā Volume 5, Extensive Decisions below Volume 3 and following, Eagle Peak Collected Discussions Volume 4, etc. I now avoid complexity - those who need [more detail] should go and investigate.

△The Extensive Decisions Volume 5 states: Generally in various texts, after [discussing] the inexpressible, [the text] necessarily clarifies the expressible because after first achieving self-realization, one necessarily teaches others.

△The Śamatha-vipaśyanā Volume 5, "Breaking Through All Dharmas" section states: Also, the Laṅkāvatāra says: "From the night I attained the Way until the night of nirvana, I did not speak a single word." The Buddha made this kind of statement based on two dharmas - namely, being conditioned by self-dharma and originally abiding dharma. Self-dharma means: what that Tathāgata obtained, I also obtained it - without increase or decrease, free from the two directions of verbal expression, false thinking, and written words. The commentary says: Being conditioned by self-dharma is the sage's realization of the true nature of absolute truth. Being free from verbal expression and false thinking is inconceivable. Being free from written words means being free from provisional names. Being free from two directions means being free from speaking and what is spoken, thinking and what is thought, naming and what is named. Originally abiding dharma refers to the ancient sagely way, the dharma-realm's permanent abiding. Like a path leading to a city - the path exists for people to travel, but is not made by the traveler. The city is reached through the path, but is not made by those who arrive. The sutra says: "A person sees a level path, immediately follows it to enter the city, and receives blissful enjoyment as desired. The permanently abiding dharma-realm of myself and previous Buddhas is also like this." Therefore, in the two nights, not one

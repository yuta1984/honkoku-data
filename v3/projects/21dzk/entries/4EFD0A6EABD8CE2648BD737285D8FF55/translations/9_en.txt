one obtains merit from all Buddhas of the three periods and ten directions. If one slanders the Buddha-mother, one becomes an enemy to all Buddhas. {Note: Text} Ancestral Writings 12 {Note: Complete volume, respectful combination}

○Daoxian's Auxiliary Record {Note: 5, 39} says: "Regarding those who fall into hell, the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra says: Those who slander the Mahayana fall into Avici Hell. When this kalpa ends, they are born in the great hells of other directions. When the kalpas of other directions end, they are born in yet other directions. Continuing in this way, they pervade the ten directions. When the kalpas of other directions end, they return to be born in the great hells of this realm. When their hell karma is exhausted, they are born among animals. They also pervade the animals of the ten directions. When their sins are exhausted, they come to be born among humans in places without Buddha-dharma. Poor and lowly, their faculties incomplete, constantly mad and confused, with nothing to distinguish or understand." {Note: Text}

△Commentary on the Treatise on Rebirth {Note: Upper 21} says: "Question: The Infinite Life Sutra says that all who wish for rebirth will attain rebirth, except only those with the five grave sins and those who slander the correct dharma. The Contemplation of Infinite Life Sutra says that even those who commit the five grave sins and ten evils, possessing all unwholesome deeds, can also attain rebirth. How do we reconcile these two sutras? Answer: One sutra [excludes those who] possess two types of grave sins: first, the five grave sins; second, slandering the correct dharma. Because of these two types of sins, they cannot attain rebirth. The other sutra only speaks of committing the ten evils, five grave sins, etc., but does not mention slandering the correct dharma. Because they do not slander the correct dharma, therefore they can be reborn. Question: Suppose there is a person who possesses the five grave sins but does not slander the correct dharma - the sutra permits their rebirth. If there is another person who only slanders the correct dharma but has no five grave sins or other sins, and wishes for rebirth, can they be reborn or not? Answer: If they slander the correct dharma, even if they have no other sins, they definitely cannot be reborn. Why do we say this? The sutra says:

【Page 18, Lower Section】
Those with the five grave sins fall into Avici Hell and fully receive the heavy sins of one kalpa. Those who slander the correct dharma fall into the great Avici Hell. When this kalpa ends, they transfer to the great Avici Hells of other directions. Continuing in this way, they pass through hundreds of thousands of great Avici Hells. The Buddha does not predict when they will escape, because the sin of slandering the correct dharma is extremely heavy." {Note: Text}

△Continuation of the Meaning of Wisdom 4 {Note: 42} says: "Question: Why does slandering sutras lead to the Uninterrupted Hell? Answer: The One Vehicle is the supremely wonderful sutra. Because one slanders the supremely wonderful dharma, one experiences the place of extreme suffering. Because one slanders the dharma and venerable persons, one falls into the retribution of lowly beasts. Because one slanders the sutra of equal great wisdom, one receives the retribution of stupid beasts. The Buddha has two teachings, expedient and real. Clinging to the expedient and breaking the real brings one-day retribution. When slandering dharma and destroying people, anger arises in the mind, therefore one receives a snake body. Because one does not properly listen to the dharma, one gets deafness as retribution. Because of stupidity in slandering dharma, one receives the retribution of a stupid animal. Because one does not accept and practice the dharma, one receives the retribution of having no feet. Because one causes sentient beings not to believe, one is bitten by small insects. Because of arrogant slander, one gets an ugly retribution. Because one slanders the subtle wonderful dharma, one gets an ugly retribution. Because one slanders the dharma that opens expedients, one gets the retribution of lameness. Because one slanders the upright sutra, one gets the retribution of a hunched back. Because one slanders the sutra of wealth and nobility, one gets the retribution of poverty and lowliness. Because one slanders the sutra of freedom, one gets unfreedom. Because one slanders the sutra of no illness, one gets the retribution of many illnesses." {Note: Above, abbreviated quotation}

○Chisho said: "Sentient beings of the final age can enter the Buddha's family simply by hearing the Lotus. Other sutras do not serve as steps."

○The Nirvana Sutra says: "There are three types of people in the world whose illnesses are difficult to cure: first, those who slander Mahayana; second, those with the five grave sins; third, icchantikas. These three illnesses are extremely severe in the world and are not within the power of shravakas, pratyekabuddhas, or bodhisattvas

to cure." {Note: And so on}

○The same {Note: Collected Commentary 1, 38} says: "If there are those who slander the Buddha's correct dharma, their tongues should be cut out." {Note: Text}

△Profound Meaning 5 {Note: 32} says: "These are expedients. Clinging to expedients and slandering reality, therefore they must be broken." {Note: Text}

○Explanatory Notes {Note: 5, 38} says: "Those who cling to the path of the Distinct Teaching and do not believe in the sudden ultimate are called 'slanderers of reality.'" {Note: And so on}

The nine grades of rebirth in the Contemplation Sutra: upper, middle, and lower three grades, each with three levels, combining to make nine grades.

│Birth│three types of sentient beings who will attain rebirth: first, those who are compassionate and do not kill, possessing various precepts; second, those who read and recite Mahayana vaipulya sutras; third, those who practice the six remembrances. Above. Privately said: Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, precepts, giving, heaven. Through dedication and vowing, one attains birth in that land. {Note: And so on}

△The Contemplation of Infinite Life Sutra says: "The Buddha told Ananda and Vaidehi: The lower grade, lower birth refers to sentient beings who commit unwholesome karma, the five grave sins and ten evils, possessing all unwholesome deeds. Such foolish people, because of their evil karma, should fall into the evil paths and experience suffering without end through many kalpas. When such foolish people approach death, they encounter good spiritual friends who comfort them in various ways, explain the wonderful dharma for them, and teach them to recite the Buddha's name. This person, oppressed by suffering, has no leisure to recite the Buddha. The good friend tells them: 'If you cannot recite, you should call upon the Buddha of Infinite Life. With such sincere mind, let your voice not cease, complete ten recitations, calling "Namo Amitabha Buddha."' Because of calling the Buddha's name, in each moment of recitation, the sins of birth and death for eighty billion kalpas are eliminated. At the time of death, they see a golden lotus flower like the sun disc standing before them. In a moment's time, they immediately attain rebirth in the Pure Land. In the lotus flower for twelve great kalpas, the lotus flower then opens. Avalokiteshvara and Mahasthamaprapta, with voices of great compassion, extensively explain the true characteristics of all dharmas for them

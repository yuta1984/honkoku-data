This is how it was.
The circulation of Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna in the various countries of India is described in the "Records of the Western Regions" and "A Record of Buddhist Practices Sent Home from the Southern Sea," so there is no time to elaborate in detail here.

Over a thousand years after the Buddha's nirvana, these teachings gradually spread eastward to China. From the Eastern Han through the Cao Wei periods, translations were not yet complete and propagation was still minimal. They flourished during the Six Dynasties and were systematized during the Tang Dynasty. Dragon-elephants emerged prominently, and vehicles and teachings were distinguished. Like the Zi and Mian rivers having different tastes, orchids and chrysanthemums competed in fragrance. In the regulatory teachings, the four vinayas were translated and transmitted, with schools diverging on conventional and ultimate truths. The opening, restraint, maintenance, violation, cessation, and action became clearly evident. In the transformative teachings, new and old sūtras and treatises were distinguished by partial and complete teachings, with different schools based on the four siddhāntas of doctrine, principle, practice, and fruition. However, as it became the semblance dharma period, human capacity gradually declined, superficially admiring the mysterious and empty while not delighting in actual practice. The masters' skillful means mostly promoted the great teachings while rarely propagating the three baskets such as the Āgamas. Masters like Kumārajīva, Daolang, and Jizang propagated the Madhyamaka school of emptiness; worthy ones like Xuanzang and Cien expounded the Yogācāra vijñāna-only teachings; masters like Mitian, Guangtong, and Jingying spread the Tathāgata-garbha teachings. The above three schools closely resembled the three Mahāyāna schools of India. Master Wen of Northern Qi recited the Madhyamaka verses and awakened to the one mind and three truths, distantly inheriting the dharma from the great master Nāgārjuna. He transmitted this to Chan Master Si of Nanyue. Chan Master Si personally realized the Lotus Samādhi, opened teaching at Mount Heng, extensively developed śamatha-vipaśyanā, and his traces approached the realization of truth. The subtle meaning of the three truths became doubly manifest at this point. He transmitted the dharma to Chan Master Zhiyi of Tiantai. Chan Master Zhiyi also realized the Lotus Samādhi, obtained the revolving dhāraṇī, composed three major works to promote the Lotus, discussed the mysterious in five levels, demonstrated observation in ten vehicles, and four

siddhāntas distinguished aspects, clarifying root and trace in ten subtleties. The three wisdoms blazed like torches, harmonizing nature and characteristics in the three dharmas. In explaining texts and meanings, the four explanations were extremely profound, opening hidden barriers. Through the revelation of the four ones, the great vehicle manifested itself. He subtly classified the temporal teachings, dividing the waves of the ocean of truths. His lofty standards stood majestically, outstanding through the ages. Regarding śamatha-vipaśyanā, he showed skillful means in five fives and revealed correct absorption in two twos. The three cessations and three observations were clear and pure, meeting with the secret treasury. The five brief and ten extensive contemplative practices adorned the jeweled vehicle. The three types of śamatha-vipaśyanā embraced both sharp and dull capacities; the six identity positions eliminated both inferiority and pride. This can be called the molding of the realm between teaching and practice, providing a model for future generations. In the Sui Dynasty, there was the great master Dixin who awakened to the dharma realm, first proclaimed the Avataṃsaka, classified teachings into five types to investigate the source of partial and complete teachings, and demonstrated three gates of observation to expand the realm between emptiness and existence. His transcendent spiritual transformation - who could fathom it? Zhixiang and Xianshou inherited and propagated this transmission. National Master Xianshou composed the "Exploration of the Profound," interpreting the Avataṃsaka, classifying teachings and explaining meanings with complete rational principles. The common and distinct one vehicle comprehensively embraced the vastness of the ocean of teachings; the five cycles of cause and effect penetrated the profound secrets of the dharma realm. The five teachings and ten schools analyzed and judged Vairocana's transformation traces; the ten mysteries and six characteristics revealed the ultimate secrets of dependent origination. The great principles of the extensive teachings became manifest here. This too was a great model within the teachings. At the beginning of the Tang Dynasty, worthy ones like Śubhakarasiṃha, Vajrabodhi, and Amoghavajra successively came from the west, translating secret sūtras. Masters like Yixing and Huiguo all received these transmissions. This teaching is indeed the secret essence of the one vehicle, taking maṇḍala as its principle. The six elements, four maṇḍalas, and three mysteries manifest the mysterious principles of the formless; secret mudrās, mantras, and ritual implements mark the secret intentions of inner realization. This is truly the mysterious gateway to entering principle. Few in the Chinese realm received this teaching. Did the conditions not

correspond? I have not heard about the prosperity and decline of later transmissions.

Among later tantric practitioners, there were superficial ones who did not grasp the mysterious meaning of the unity of exoteric and esoteric teachings, falsely boasting about tantric teachings while criticizing and rejecting exoteric scriptures. What they particularly did not know was that so-called exoteric teachings are the wisdom seals of Vairocana's ocean of nature, the wonderful dharma of the same sweet dew. How could they not know? True tantric teachings harmonize in principle with the Avataṃsaka, Prajñāpāramitā, Lotus, and Nirvana sūtras like matching tally pieces. If there were tantric teachings that did not share the same principle with the Avataṃsaka and others, they would definitely be heterodox tantra. Boasting about heterodox tantra while falsely demeaning exoteric teachings is exactly like treasuring worthless stones while discarding luminous pearls. Is this not also deluding? There is also a category who misunderstand tantric texts, taking the formed as the ultimate principle and the formless as provisional explanation - this is the extreme of error. This will be discussed at the appropriate time. Moreover, this teaching encompasses three types of beings, and what the three types study has clear standards. If there is presumption and confusion, it will instead bring calamity and transgression. This must be known. This too will be discussed at the appropriate time.

The venerable Bodhidharma of South India crossed the ocean and came west, entering Liang. When conditions did not correspond, he moved his staff to Shaolin Temple on Mount Song in Wei. He presented the direct pointing to seeing one's nature, transmitting the dharma to Chan Master Ke. Through six transmissions it reached Caoxi. Under the Fifth Patriarch it divided into northern and southern schools; under the Sixth Patriarch emerged the two branches of Nanyue and Qingyuan. From then onward, five lineages branched and flowed, spreading throughout the realm. This school directly investigates one's own mind-nature, taking awakening as the standard. It seeks to enable students to not follow the paths of the three vehicles but directly board the great vehicle of the open ground, thus making "direct pointing, special transmission, not establishing written words" their family style. Although they do not

rely on the textual explanations of the three baskets and vaipulya teachings, they are able to accord with the principles and aims of the three baskets and vaipulya teachings. This can be called a wonderful skillful means that transcends methods and surpasses conventions.

Shaolin's implementation of this living skillful means probably had two intentions. First, to enable a certain class of those with great root-nature to not become involved in side paths, directly severing the deluded roots of ignorance, developing the correct causes of the vajra nature, and continuing the wisdom-life of buddhas and patriarchs. Although this does not use doctrinal classification, when discussed precisely, this is the sudden teaching Mahāyāna described in the Laṅkāvatāra, Vimalakīrti, Yuanjue and other sūtras, being one dharma gate that embraces immeasurable great capacities. What is there to find strange about this? Second, to criticize teachings and break characteristics, dissolve attachments and remove bonds, wielding the vajra precious sword to slay the demons of corruption within the teachings, thereby protecting the true lineage of the three baskets and vaipulya teachings that was about to be severed. Just as great masters like Aśvaghoṣa, Nāgārjuna, Asaṅga, and Vasubandhu were moved by how scholars of the three baskets had fallen into names and characteristics with practice and realization about to be abandoned, and having no choice, opened and developed the Mahāyāna secret treasury to rescue the declining customs, adapting to that particular time. Later, when the teachings entered the semblance dharma period, those who transmitted Mahāyāna increasingly wandered in the realm of textual knowledge and understanding, increasingly obstructing the gate of self-awakening. The teachings that had been meant to correct abuses instead became another abuse, exactly like adding frost to snow. Consequently, true practitioners who "set forth beyond the skandhas and realms" were nearly about to expire. At this point, Shaolin applied wonderful skill, directly pointing to and demonstrating the true essence of vajra nature, seeking to enable students to break free from the shackles of textual knowledge and understanding, emerge from the lairs of the poisonous snakes of skandhas and sense-fields, and directly return to the great treasure house of the unconditioned. Viewing it from this perspective, Shaolin's rejection of teachings was merely rejecting the teachings'

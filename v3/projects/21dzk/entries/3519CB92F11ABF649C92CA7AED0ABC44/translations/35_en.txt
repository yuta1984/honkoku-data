exceeds the regulations. This is specifically clarified in the Brahmajāla Sūtra, Vimalakīrtinirdeśa Sūtra, Upāsakaśīla Sūtra, and other sūtras and commentaries. Second, practicing concentration. This again has two parts: first, clarifying the dharmas commonly studied by the three vehicles; second, clarifying Mahāyāna samādhi. The first, dharmas commonly studied by the three vehicles, begins with using the five methods of stopping the mind to eliminate the five false thoughts, and after the warming and summit stages, one enters and exits various meditations and practices the concentrations dependent on levels, as clarified in various treatises. The Pure Mind Admonishing Contemplation states: "The five false thoughts are like removing thorn trees - first cut their roots. Therefore, cultivate the five stopping contemplations to cease the five faults, stopping them from arising, hence called stopping-mind contemplation. Through cultivating this contemplation, present afflictions do not operate, and one obtains the place from which small liberation arises. When precepts and concentration become pliable, one gradually attains supernatural powers, called great liberation. When the ten obstructions are completely extinguished, this is called true liberation." It also states: "If initially entering the path, both Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna practitioners commonly cultivate this contemplation. Even if one cultivates the five stopping contemplations, the cultivation of the path will definitely succeed." It also states: "If one enters the ānāpāna contemplation method, the mental factors gradually cease 《interpolation: up to》 the nine successive concentrations, returning to the one true pure mind. This pure mind is called Buddha-nature, called the true eternal dharma-body, the mind of no-mind, the characteristic of no-characteristics." It also states: "If one wishes to cut off the bonds and afflictions, immediately cultivate the five stopping contemplation methods to counteract them. Through ānāpāna mindfulness, one enters the three liberation gates, contemplates emptiness and transcends characteristics, the bonds and afflictions are severed, and body and mind become tranquil. Therefore afflictions do not arise. Where afflictions are extinguished is called true liberation. Liberation is great nirvana." It also states: "Bonds and afflictions falsely grasp and reject, thick cataracts obstruct seeing the path. Therefore cultivate the five stopping contemplations to purify the mind and achieve inner clarity." Later, clarifying Mahāyāna samādhi refers to the samādhis explained in Mahāyāna sūtras, such as the Pratyutpannabuddhasaṃmukhāvasthitasamādhi, Vaipulya, Lotus Sūtra, etc. Among Nanshan's compositions, although he mentions their names, he does not show the methods. However, in historical records, we see that the patriarch practiced the Pratyutpannabuddha

samādhi approximately twenty times. From this we can verify that Nanshan deeply revered this method. The Pratyutpannabuddha samādhi is buddha-mindfulness stopping-mind contemplation and the secret essential of Mahāyāna śamatha. Moreover, through Amitābha Buddha's spiritual power and blessing, all obstructions are suddenly removed and samādhi is easily achieved. The reason our master particularly revered this method lies perhaps in this point. The methods of Pratyutpannabuddha are as clarified in the Pratyutpannabuddhasaṃmukhāvasthitasamādhi Sūtra and the Mahā-śamatha-vipaśyanā.

Nanshan deeply esteemed the five stopping contemplation methods and Pratyutpannabuddha samādhi, and the traces of developing concentration and sensing auspicious signs are brilliant. Why do later generations who follow the Nanshan school not resemble the patriarchal tradition?

Third, studying wisdom has two types: first, contaminated wisdom; second, uncontaminated wisdom. The so-called contaminated wisdom refers to the wisdom gained through hearing, thinking, and cultivation. Although these three wisdoms penetrate both ordinary and noble beings, in their respective categories, the two wisdoms of hearing and thinking are obtained by outer ordinary beings, while cultivated wisdom is obtained by inner ordinary beings. Through these skillful means, uncontaminated wisdom is developed. Second, uncontaminated wisdom is broadly divided into three: first, wisdom of personal emptiness; second, wisdom of dharma emptiness; third, Middle Way wisdom. The patriarch's frequent mention of the three contemplations generally accords with these three, as can be known. The cultivation of the three studies explained above is the wonderful path for practitioners of the three vehicles to enter correct nature and freedom from birth, and the correct track of the one teaching in Jambudvīpa. Third, clarifying the fruits of practice. This also has two aspects: first, the gradual teaching gate; second, the sudden teaching gate. The so-called gradual teaching takes the four śramaṇa fruits as near fruits and great bodhi as distant fruits. The speed of turning the mind is as discerned elsewhere. The so-called sudden teaching gate directly enters the Mahāyāna, taking attainment of avaivartika as the near fruit and the two wonderful turning fruits as distant fruits. And

its direct path has two kinds of ways. First, the bodhisattva develops the mind and establishes the great hero's aspiration, enduring 110 sufferings without seeing the characteristics of suffering, depending on the three collections of precepts, arousing the four universal vows, cultivating the four immeasurables and practicing the six perfections. The vow is: from now until becoming buddha, not generating anger, resentment, harm or affliction toward sentient beings. Another vow: from now until becoming buddha, not using a single lustful mind to be greedy and defiled toward men and women. Another vow: from now until becoming buddha, not using a grasping mind to generate various evil thoughts and contemplations. Another vow: life after life to transcend the eight difficulties without the path-mind retreating. Practicing thus with gradual increase in clarity, one finally becomes avaivartika. What are the characteristics of avaivartika? Not being defiled by the three realms, not being weary of the three realms, seeking the unconditioned path without dwelling in the unconditioned, not being in this or that, not being attached to the Middle Way, constantly dwelling in saṃsāra while having no saṃsāra. Why not dwell in the unconditioned? Because of embracing and receiving the correct dharma, because of embracing and transforming sentient beings, because original vows are inexhaustible. Why not be defiled by the three realms? Because afflictions are exhausted, because karma does not bind, attaining great sovereignty on the shore of birth and death, sporting in the ocean of liberation. These are the characteristics of avaivartika. The other is when bodhisattvas, although developing the great mind and compassionately pitying sentient beings, either from fear of retreat and fall, or from joy in seeing buddhas, vow to be born in other pure lands or vow to be born in Tuṣita's inner courtyard. By depending on birth in superior places, one obtains superior maturation results and naturally enters the Mahāyāna correct definite group. This is as specifically described in the commentaries and Pure Mind Admonishing Contemplation. Second, showing the sequence of study and practice according to sūtras: In the Madhyama Āgama, scroll 35, the Buddha addresses the mathematician brahmin Maudgalyāyana, explaining the sequences of ladders, training horses and elephants, and teaching calculation to discuss the sequence of Buddha-dharma and vinaya. Namely, first bodily, verbal, and mental purity with correct livelihood and eating,

【Seventy-first Page Lower Section】
next contemplating the inner body, next guarding and protecting the sense faculties, next advancing and stopping deportment most quietly and orderly, with robes and bowl accompanying the body, next at places of no affairs - under trees or in cemeteries - cultivating meditation contemplation, abandoning and removing the five hindrances, even entering the fourth meditation. Next teaching the exhaustion of all outflows. Also, scroll 36 shows the sequence of study and practice: first receiving precepts with robes and bowl like wings, the mind without attachment, next guarding and protecting the faculty gates, next deportment quiet and orderly with proper advancing and stopping, next cultivating meditation contemplation. Also, scroll 48 clarifies the sequence of study and practice, etc. The doctrinal approach of Nanshan's promotion of vinaya completely accords with the sūtra explanations and is admirable. Carefully examining what the Āgama explains, what is narrated here is nothing outside precepts, concentration, and wisdom. Within the study of precepts, correct livelihood, deportment, and protecting faculties are distinguished, making six dharmas. However, if these six dharmas are compared to the human body, then concentration and wisdom are like the internal organs, protecting faculties like qi and blood, precept practice like bones and flesh, correct livelihood like skin and tendons, deportment like hair, fur, nails, and teeth. Among such things, if one is lacking then it is not a person. Studying the path is also thus - the above six dharmas are the complete substance of śramaṇa dharma. If one is lacking, it is not true and correct study of the path. If what is studied is deficient, not only will the path karma not be accomplished, but any movement will harm people and dharma. How can one not be afraid? The families studying vinaya in the final age often generate teacher-insects. Outwardly they display robes and bowls accompanying the body, neat appearance, slow walking and direct gazing, low voice and closed eyes and other vinaya characteristics, but inwardly they harbor defects - precept karma is not pure, correct livelihood is not practiced, faculty gates are not protected, concentration and wisdom are not cultivated. Nanshan reproved this as the group that is internally defiled and externally pure, deceiving the Buddha. Looking back, are the deportments that deceive the Buddha comparable to hair, fur, nails, and teeth separated from the body? They can be discarded into dung heaps. Those who destroy the Nanshan school are precisely these

people. Jaku, with thin practice and meager virtue, has improperly ascended to full ordination and shamefully claims to be a descendant of Nanshan. How could there not be the fault of covering up public coldness? Reaching old age, I increasingly harbor shame and fear. Now I merely lament that the propagation of this school has turned extremely contrary to the patriarch's intention, forgetting my own inadequacy, briefly expressing my thoughts to inform fellow practitioners. Do not blame me for being presumptuous. The discernment of the Nanshan school is complete.

The doctrinal approach of Nanshan is most difficult to understand clearly. One should carefully investigate and analyze the purport of the commentaries and intensively read and study the Pure Mind Admonishing Contemplation until the binding cords break thrice. Otherwise, one will inevitably mistake the false vinaya deportment that Nanshan severely criticized for maintaining vinaya, arrogantly and improperly accepting others' respect and offerings, with faults reaching everywhere. How can one not sigh deeply?

The six schools narrated above all investigate ultimate principles and are able to appropriately meet the occasion and capacity. They are truly the bright banners illuminating the final age. If we broadly discuss the teaching dharmas that equally flow from the dharma realm, all the Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna, provisional and real dharma gates are complete with the seven excellences, being the same one sweet dew wonderful dharma mandala. It is only due to the times and responsive capacity that they flourish or decline in their time. If one follows these correct dharma teachings and practices as explained, one will definitely eliminate the two heavy obstructions, transcend the two kinds of birth and death, and realize perfect transformation of the basis. The above completes the doctrinal gate of manifesting principles through categories.

[Published edition postface states]
The Buddha Way is remote from the sages. The patriarchal way has declined and different views compete for prominence. Vast and obscure, it is difficult to distinguish east from west. Without enlightened ones arising to manifest the correct, even the intelligent and quick would rarely avoid losing direction. What harm to Buddha students could be greater? This compilation manifests what people have not manifested, promotes what people have not promoted. It is the south-pointing needle in a sea of fog, the North Star on a night journey. It can be said that the ancient way has been restored in the present. How can one not rejoice and leap for joy? This book has two versions, front and back. One was composed at Saijō during the Chōji era, one was written at Tōto Chōsen. The front version had certain taboos and did not exhaust the profound mysteries. The back version opens and reveals direct explanation without remaining mysteries. The current publication follows the front version. Readers should not be misled by this. I had shallow karmic fortune and did not obtain personal instruction from the vinaya master. With endless regret, I therefore carved this in wood blocks to slightly express my sorrow and mourning. Spring of the Boshin year. Respectfully noted by lay practitioner Kōka of Nyonyo Residence.

These are people of superior birth. All other merits should be completely dedicated to rebirth, as should be understood. Next, following the Pratyutpanna-samādhi Sutra, the dharma of Buddha-mindfulness samādhi is demonstrated. Next, methods such as entering the practice hall are clarified. All of these together are essential practices for aspiring to be born in pure lands. They should be examined and investigated. The so-called "four cultivations" are: respectful cultivation, exclusive cultivation, uninterrupted cultivation, and long-term cultivation. First, respectful cultivation means respectfully prostrating to that Buddha and all those holy assemblies, etc. Therefore it is called "respectful cultivation." Taking one's entire life as the period, one vows never to cease. This is long-term cultivation. Second, exclusive cultivation means exclusively calling that Buddha's name, exclusively contemplating, exclusively thinking, exclusively prostrating, exclusively praising that Buddha and all holy assemblies, etc., not mixing in other practices. Therefore it is called "exclusive cultivation." Vowing with one's entire life as the period not to cease, this is long-term cultivation. Third, uninterrupted cultivation means continuously performing respectful prostrations, calling names and offering praise, remembering and contemplating, dedicating merit and making vows, with mind-moments continuing without letting other activities intervene. Therefore it is called "uninterrupted cultivation." Also, not letting greed, hatred, and afflictions intervene, repenting immediately upon transgression, not allowing separation by thoughts, time, or days, constantly maintaining purity - this is also called "uninterrupted cultivation." Taking one's entire life as the period, vowing never to cease - this is long-term cultivation. Moreover, bodhisattvas who have already escaped birth and death dedicate the good dharmas they create to seeking buddha-fruition. This is self-benefit. Teaching and transforming sentient beings throughout endless future kalpas - this is benefiting others. However, sentient beings of the present time are all bound by afflictions and have not yet escaped sufferings such as evil destinies and birth-and-death. Following conditions to arouse practices, they should completely and quickly dedicate all good roots, aspiring to be reborn in Amitābha Buddha's land. Having arrived in that land, with nothing more to fear, the four cultivations as above naturally and spontaneously function, with self-benefit and benefiting others being completely fulfilled. This follows the four cultivations explained in treatises such as the Mahāyāna-saṃgraha and Vijñānavāda treatises, adapting them to demonstrate the practices of exclusive cultivators. Also, in the Rebirth

Liturgy of Praise, repentance is extensively clarified: "Repentance has three grades: superior, middle, and inferior. Superior repentance refers to when blood flows from one's own pores and blood emerges from the eyes - this is called superior repentance. Middle repentance refers to when hot sweat emerges from pores throughout the body and blood flows from the eyes - this is called middle repentance. Inferior repentance refers to when there is slight fever throughout the body and tears emerge from the eyes - this is called inferior repentance. Although these three grades have differences, they indicate people who have long planted good roots of the liberation portion, causing them in this life to respect the Dharma and value people without sparing body and life. Even for small transgressions, if one repents, one can penetrate heart and body. Those who can repent like this, regardless of duration, will have all heavy obstructions completely extinguished at once. If not like this, even if one rushes about day and night for twelve hours, there will ultimately be no benefit. For those who cannot do this, one should know that even if unable to shed tears and blood, etc., those who can achieve sincere and thorough [repentance] are the same as the above." The Pratyutpanna Praise says: "Respectfully addressing all fellow practitioners of rebirth: We should greatly feel shame and regret. Śākyamuni Tathāgata is truly a compassionate father and mother who, through various skillful means, arouses our supreme faith and also explains various skillful expedient teaching gates - not just one. This is only for us, ordinary beings with inverted views. If one cultivates according to the teachings, then through every gate one sees buddhas and obtains birth in pure lands. If one sees or hears people practicing good, one immediately assists them with good. If one sees or hears people following teachings, one praises them according to the teachings. If one hears people explaining practices, one immediately follows those practices in accordance. If one hears that people have realization, one immediately rejoices in that realization according to it. What is the meaning? For those who do so, they equally take all buddhas as teachers and take the Dharma as mother, with shared nurturing and intimate affection that is not external. One must not disparage others' teachings and practices that have karmic connection while praising one's own essential dharmas with karmic connection. This immediately constitutes self-destruction of the

Dharma-eyes of all buddhas. Once the Dharma-eye is extinguished, there is no way to step on the correct path of enlightenment. How could one be able to enter the gate of pure lands?" Lamenting sorrowfully, he said: "Born blind, believing in and running after karma, following karma to fall into deep pits, giving free rein to these fires of greed and hatred, harming oneself and harming others, long submerged in the ocean of ignorance - even if encountering driftwood, there is eternally no karmic connection. Practitioners, etc., must constantly arouse minds of praise and accordance toward all ordinary and sage realms, not generating disputes, jealousy, and resentment. Why is this so? It is to guard one's own body, speech, and mental activities, fearing the arising of unwholesome karma. Furthermore, this creates cyclic existence no different from before. If one can protect and purify the three activities in relation to self and others' realms, this is the correct cause for birth in buddha-lands." Question: "Since you say that purity of the three activities is the cause for birth in pure lands, how does one perform activities to merit the name 'pure'?" Answer: "Regarding all unwholesome dharmas, completely cutting off and not performing [activities of] self and others' body, speech, and mind - this is called 'purity.' Moreover, regarding good [dharmas] that correspond to self and others' body, speech, and mind, one immediately arouses supreme rejoicing mind. Like the rejoicing in what buddhas and bodhisattvas do, I also rejoice likewise. Through these good roots, one dedicates [merit] for rebirth in pure lands. Therefore it is called the 'correct cause.'"

Jaku privately reflects: "Master Dōshaku's orientation toward the essence of understanding and practice is certainly beyond discussion. Regarding the Pure Land dharma, the thoroughness of his personal practice and the earnest compassion of his teaching others are probably unmatched in ancient and modern times. What is regrettable is that those in later generations who cling perversely to this master's words and phrases are like ox hair in number, while those who truly accord with this master's real meaning are rarer than unicorn horns. Although this is what the degenerate age brings about, one cannot help but feel deeply moved."

Fifth, judging teachings and establishing the school: This contains two parts. First clarifying teachings, then discussing the school. Within first clarifying teachings,

【Fifty-third Page Lower Section】
there are also two parts. First, generally clarifying Pure Land teachings; second, specifically judging teachings regarding the three Pure Land sutras. First, generally clarifying Pure Land teachings means that all Mahāyāna provisional and ultimate teachings, principles, practices, and fruits are all Pure Land teachings. Among all Mahāyāna provisional and ultimate practices, accomplishing non-retrogression has difficulty and ease. This Pure Land dharma gate is the easy practice path and the secret technique for saving and embracing sentient beings who fear retrogression. Therefore one should judge only through the two paths of difficult and easy, and should not dare to make detailed judgments of teachings' superiority or inferiority. Second, specifically judging teachings regarding the three Pure Land sutras means that generally all Mahāyāna dharmas are divided into two: first, provisional; second, ultimate. This sutra is included in Mahāyāna ultimate teachings. It is primarily for embracing sentient beings who have retreated from the three vehicles, enabling them to enter the group of those with correct determination in Mahāyāna. Secondarily, it embraces bodhisattvas of deep stages, enabling them to gain the benefit of advancing on the path and reducing rebirths.

Jaku privately reflects: "Pure Land dharma gates should only be judged through the two paths of difficult and easy, and not be analyzed and judged through the four teachings, five teachings, etc. - this constitutes its school character. For example, Xianshou judged the Brahmā's Net Sutra through transformative and regulatory teachings, but did not judge it through the five teachings."

Second, clarifying the school: Ancient masters all followed their original schools in cultivating Pure Land dharmas, not separately establishing a school. When it came to Yoshimizu, a separate school was established, as already described above. However, establishing or not establishing each has its reasoning. The reason why ancient worthies did not separately establish [a school] was probably because students of various schools - Huayan, Sanlun, Yogācāra, Nanshan, Tiantai, etc. - followed their respective schools in seeking great enlightenment. One category feared retrogression and wished to be reborn in pure lands to quickly achieve non-retrogression, and therefore cultivated Pure Land dharmas. This completely presented no obstruction

The aspect of breaking dharmas means using the three contemplations to break the three delusions. The three contemplations are unified in one mind, and there is no delusion that cannot be broken. Therefore, the sutra says, "Its swiftness is like wind." The five consciousnesses' penetration and obstruction refer to suffering, accumulation, the twelve causes and conditions, the six coverings, and dust-like ignorance as obstructions, while the path of extinction that extinguishes causes and conditions, the six perfections, unified mind, and three contemplations serve as penetration. If there is penetration, it must be protected; if there is obstruction, it must be broken. Creating obstruction within penetration, where the ability to break is like what is broken, examining section by section - this is called "understanding penetration and obstruction." The sutra says "placing a cinnabar pillow" refers to a pillow outside the cart. The harmonious adjustment of the six paths refers to the unconditioned path factors, each properly adjusted and entered according to what is appropriate. The sutra's reference to "having a great white ox" etc. refers to those of middle capacity mentioned above. The seventh, counteracting aids to opening, means that if the correct path has many obstacles and the perfect principle does not open, one must cultivate auxiliary practices - namely the five methods for calming the mind and the six perfections, etc. The sutra's reference to "also many servants" considers those below this as having lesser capacity. The eighth, knowing the stages and ranks, is so that practitioners avoid conceit of superiority. The ninth, the ability to patiently endure, means remaining calm and unmoved in adverse and favorable circumstances, encouraging progress through the five grades to enter the six roots. The tenth, non-attachment to dharmas, means not being attached to the similar path of the ten faiths, but needing to enter the true principle of the first stage of dwelling. The sutra says, "Riding this precious vehicle, traveling in the four directions" refers to traveling through the forty stages, "proceeding directly to the place of enlightenment" refers to the stage of wonderful enlightenment. Respectfully examining the comprehensive texts of the Tiantai school, using the five periods and eight teachings to excerpt and record the various schools of our country, we briefly understand it thus. If one wishes to clarify this in detail, please examine the ten volumes of the Lotus Sutra's Profound Meaning, which thoroughly judges the ceremonial forms of dharma teaching by all Buddhas of the ten directions and three times, clear as a bright mirror, and the four volumes of the Profound Meaning of the Vimalakīrti Sutra. They completely judge the aspects of teaching. From this point onward, we merely briefly clarify the ceremonial forms of doctrinal classification by various schools. At the time of Hōei 2, year of the wood rooster, early autumn, when collected in Rakuyō, Yakurin of the capital, Dōmai Myōmi,

together shared and distributed food, and also provided brush and ink.

Alas, as I am about to lay down my brush, I obtain verses and write once more:
The absolute and naturally true exists within one school; thereby I know the ocean of thoughts is vast and boundless. The various sectarian gates ultimately seem to be fathomed.
How could the non-dual teaching and contemplation not be unified? Wisdom is the ten vehicles, emotion is the ten realms. Taking emptiness as non-emptiness, provisional as non-provisional.
If one deeply comprehends the meaning within the wonderful middle, why wonder that silent illumination ascends to brilliant splendor?

Manifest the Correct Dharma and Restore Antiquity Collection, First Volume
　　　　　　　　　　　Composed by Bhikṣu Dōkō Fujaku of Chōsen Ritsu-in
Intending to rely on the correct dharma teaching to raise and reveal the great outline of principle and teaching, I establish two gates: first, the gate of manifesting principle and distinguishing teaching; second, the gate of breaking heterodoxy and correcting abuses. The first gate of manifesting principle and distinguishing teaching is also divided into two: first manifesting principle, then distinguishing teaching. First, manifesting principle: The application of teaching to spiritual capacity is like medicine responding to illness. For example, suppose there were a strong man who possessed the combined wisdom of Zhang Liang, the courage of Meng Ben, the talent of Cao Zijian, and the eloquence of Chunyu Kun. Due to the four great elements becoming discordant and damaged, he contracts a severe chronic illness. His complexion becomes haggard, his form withered, his vital energy exhausted, his consciousness confused. Sometimes cold, sometimes hot, his eyes dizzy, his ears ringing, his teeth parched, his tongue contracted, food will not go down, elimination blocked. Sometimes delirious and convulsing, speaking nonsense, his four limbs paralyzed, unable to lie down or rise without assistance. At such a time, all the complexion, vital energy, wisdom, courage, talent, and eloquence he possessed in normal life become completely unavailable. If by chance there is a skilled physician who diagnoses the pulse, examines the illness, skillfully applies therapeutic methods, with medicine matching the disease, maintaining careful regulation without negligence, the illness gradually heals completely, and complexion, vital energy, etc. all return to their original state. At such a time, all the afflictions present during illness also become unavailable. The delusion and enlightenment of sentient beings is also like this. Mind-nature is originally thusness, inherently possessing the excellent virtues of the Ganges' sands. But due to the power of beginningless ignorance's permeation and habituation, the various consciousnesses generate subject-object grasping, clinging to self and clinging to phenomena. From the two attachments arise the two kinds of obstructions. From the two obstructions arise countless afflictions of birth and death. The coarse ones

are called birth and death with remainder, the subtle ones are called birth and death without remainder. Though coarse and subtle differ, both are false aggregates. When false aggregates arise, excellent virtues exceeding the Ganges' sands all fail to manifest. Sometimes when past good karma unfolds and one hears the correct dharma that flows from the most pure dharma realm, practicing proper mental attention and cultivation according to the teaching, then either gradually or suddenly, one eliminates the two attachments, severs the two obstructions, transcends the two deaths, and achieves the three kinds of bodhi. Countless samādhis, wisdom, spiritual powers, dhāraṇīs, and beneficial functions like the Ganges' sands all become manifest and accomplished. This can be understood through analogy. What is meant by "the correct dharma teaching that flows from the most pure dharma realm"? The true suchness realized by the Tathāgata is called the most pure dharma realm. All the 84,000 dharma collections taught by the Tathāgata are entirely dharmas flowing from true suchness - maṇḍala wisdom-seals that accord with the nature and can correspond with the three dharma-seals and the one reality-seal. This is called the correct dharma teaching.

The three dharma-seals are: the seal of impermanence of all conditioned phenomena, the seal of non-self of all phenomena, and the seal of the tranquility of nirvana. The Āgama and other Tripiṭaka use these three seals to verify and distinguish orthodox from heterodox. What conforms to these three seals is considered correct dharma; what does not conform to these seals is considered heterodox teaching. This is like worldly official seals that distinguish authentic from counterfeit goods. The one reality-seal is the ultimate truth of Vaipulya Mahāyāna, which uses this as its seal, as detailed in the Treatise on Great Perfection of Wisdom.

Also, what accords with the four truths, two truths, three truths, and one reality-truth is called the correct dharma teaching.
The four truths are as explained in the Āgama; the two truths are as clarified in Jizang's Chapter on Two Truths, Cien's Dharma Garden Chapter on Two Truths, the Profound Meaning, etc.; the three truths and one reality-truth are as taught entirely in the Tiantai school.

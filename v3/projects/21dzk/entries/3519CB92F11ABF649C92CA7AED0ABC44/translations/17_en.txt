capacities. Although these two capacities differ, both use faith, joy, understanding and comprehension to realize that one's own equal mind-ground is precisely the Middle Way ultimate truth of all-knowing wisdom, making this the foundation of practice. They purify and cure the three poisons and afflictions, and eliminate the five aggregates, karma, and lifespan as their practice method. However, this practice method also has two categories. Those who cultivate and enter relying solely on ritual aspects such as offerings, fire rituals, and mantra-holding are conduct-practice. Those who enter great emptiness wisdom through the ten dependent origination phrases, or contemplate the A-syllable to understand original non-arising, or combine phenomenal and principle cultivation, etc., are wisdom-practice. Although the practice gates differ, their essential point lies in removing the mental defilements of the five aggregates. Why? Because this teaching makes removing the four defilements through the samādhi of removing covering obstructions the beginning of entering principle. The four defilements are: love-view defilements, śrāvaka defilements, pratyekabuddha defilements, and bodhisattva defilements. Love-view defilements are the most difficult heavy defilements to remove and should be removed first. Therefore this teaching takes Acalanātha as Vairocana Tathāgata's accomplishing wisdom, using the wisdom sword to kill karmic afflictions and lifespans, achieving the life of dharma-nature's true purity as its great function. Trailokyavijaya also represents subduing the three poisons of the three worlds. The commentary clearly indicates that sentient beings with heavy obstructions of the five turbidities must rely on Acalanātha and Trailokyavijaya for cultivation and entry. Also, the secret teaching of offerings and fire rituals lies entirely in purifying and curing afflictive mental defilements. The Yoga Mahā-tantra-rāja Sūtra states: "If there are people who do not rely on this wondrous dharma ambrosia for diligent burning cultivation, they cannot eliminate all afflictions. Even in this teaching, randomly cultivating one dharma or one practice, with precise recitation abiding in tranquility and entering samādhi, one can cut afflictions and directly realize buddha-fruit," etc. Such clear texts shine brilliantly in the sūtras and commentaries—there is no time to elaborate fully. However, afflictive mental defilements are extremely difficult to purify and cure, so first

one initially restrains the bodily and verbal karmas arising from afflictions. This is called the expedient training ground. Being able to restrain body and speech to separate from faults and evils allows afflictive mental defilements to naturally diminish and be subdued, after which one enters samaya precepts. Know that the expedient training ground is the foundation of samaya precepts. Therefore, ordinary beings of heavy obstructions in the five turbidities who receive this teaching first gain faith in the Tathāgata's secret treasury, and their cultivation should appropriately progress in sequence: first removing bodily and verbal faults, next removing afflictive mental defilements, next removing two-vehicle defilements, finally removing bodhisattvas' provisional attachments—from coarse to subtle, like washing clothes. The Doctrinal Commentary states: "Tracing the beginning and seeking the end, from generating a hair's breadth of goodness to transcending the two obstructions of persons, dharmas, existence and non-existence, although the ultimate principle is brilliantly manifest, increasingly wondrous and profound, this addresses defilements external to the mind, but has not yet opened the inconceivable secret matters within this mind. From this point forward, then it is explained." Also: "True mantra practitioners simply use expedient means to purify their own minds. If the three karmas are pure, they should naturally gain clarity within this and awaken themselves," etc. Also: "As the Buddha taught, even if blood, flesh, fat and marrow are all exhausted with only skin, bones and sinews remaining, not abandoning diligence—thus one attains samatha and vipaśyanā. Attaining these two things, all matters are accomplished," etc. This is the correct path of childish sattva cultivation.

Ordinary beings in the turbid Jambudvīpa world are included among childish sattvas and must rely on the path of sequential advancement for actual cultivation and practice, like Tiantai's gradual śamatha-vipaśyanā. However, later schools that indiscriminately appropriate the esoteric vehicle erroneously cite Vajrasattva's mysterious realm as their own level, rashly claiming that the path of restraining karmic faults and purifying afflictions is not the correct cultivation of the esoteric vehicle. This is

the great harm of riding the final period. This not only contradicts what is taught in the esoteric Tripiṭaka, but also goes against the great principle of all Buddhist teachings. How can one not be afraid? I secretly think this teaching is the secret ultimate of Mahāyāna, the most difficult dharma to understand. If one wishes to receive this teaching, one should first be able to understand the great principles of Vaipulya Mahāyāna characteristics and nature, then thoroughly read and contemplate the Mahāvairocana Sūtra commentary until the binding breaks three times. Otherwise, one will inevitably turn ambrosia into poison.

Fourth, clarifying the Chan School, divided into three sections: 1) Ancestral succession, 2) Sectarian purport, 3) Cultivation and realization. First, ancestral succession: The First Ancestor Master faced the wall at Shaolin, not necessarily propagating teachings. Later there was Shenguang who came seeking peace of mind. The Ancestor said: "Bring your mind here and I will pacify it for you." Guang said: "I seek the mind but cannot obtain it." The Ancestor said: "I have finished pacifying your mind." Guang greatly awakened at these words, changed his name to Huike, and became the Second Ancestor by inheriting the dharma. This was its beginning. There were also several others like Daoyu and Nun Zongchi who also gained awakening, but the Way had not yet greatly flourished. By the time of the Fifth Ancestor, two branches emerged: Dajian and Datong, with the school splitting into Southern and Northern. From then on, the five leaves divided their brilliance, adorning the Way, and the sectarian wind arose vigorously, filling the entire world.

This sectarian lineage succession is recorded in historical traditions, so I will not repeat it here.

Second, sectarian purport: This school takes "directly pointing to the human mind, seeing nature and achieving buddhahood" as its ultimate aim. However, the difficulty of seeing mind-nature is like a royal goose extracting milk from water, or like a craftsman refining gold from ore. Although the pointing is straightforward, for those who would see it, there must be difficulty and ease, suddenness and gradualness.

In later generations there were certain Chan practitioners who claimed: "Our school is the path of direct pointing to see nature; all other schools are roundabout paths." They constantly boast of direct pointing and disparage the teaching vehicles, etc. I say: this is

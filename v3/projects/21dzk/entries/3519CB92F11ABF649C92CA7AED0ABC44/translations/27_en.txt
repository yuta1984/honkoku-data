[whatsoever]. Therefore, the fundamental purpose of all Mahāyāna teachings is precisely the fundamental purpose of the Pure Land dharma gate. As for [the fundamental purpose] of those Pure Land three-part sutras and the Rebirth Treatise, this is certainly beyond discussion. Masters such as Lushan, Xuanzhong, Jiacai, Xihe, and Wuzhen all equally took the One True Dharma Realm as their ultimate principle, the Two Truths as their foundation, śamatha and vipaśyanā as their contemplative practices, being born in pure lands and entering the group of correct determination as the proximate result, and unsurpassed enlightenment as the distant result. Regarding this great school, they were mysteriously united in agreement. Only in their practice and cultivation were there slight differences. The reason why Yoshimizu separately established this school was probably because this is the secret technique for embracing and transforming the most difficult-to-transform sentient beings of the turbid world. Carefully examining what historical records contain: Master Yoshimizu was indeed an extraordinary vessel born for his age. Early on he entered Mount Hiei to study and polish Tendai teachings, carried his book bag in all directions to comprehensively study various schools, repeatedly read through the Tripiṭaka to deeply explore the profound principles. Moreover, not only was his learning and knowledge outstanding among his peers, but his practice and virtue also surpassed his class. When he cultivated the Lotus Samādhi, he perceived a white elephant in meditation; when he copied the great Avatamsaka Sutra, a divine dragon came before his desk. Sometimes he transformed spirit serpents in the temple grounds, sometimes manifested circular light in the moon disk. The sixteen subtle contemplations appeared at will before him; for over ten years he continuously witnessed excellent signs. Records of his samādhi and meditative states still exist. How could such a person, troubled by the difficulty of learning Tendai teachings and contemplation, abandon his school and enter Pure Land teachings? The reason for his separately establishing one school is brilliantly clear in the patriarchal writings. Jaku has long understood this. Yet if I were to explain and write about it, I fear it would conflict with the times. If I remain silent and set it aside, I also worry that this would ultimately cause the patriarch to be likened to buddhas by village elders, and Yoshimizu's dharma lineage would become blocked and not practiced in the

world. At this point, though not without dwelling in Zhou She's boldness of speech, I also cannot bear to submit and follow the crowd's mere agreement. Advancing and retreating, I find myself in a dilemma, only able to steel myself with courage. [Thus] I conclude discussing Pure Land school teachings.

Later students deeply revere the patriarch, yet those whose [understanding] conflicts with the patriarch's intention like ice and fire are probably many. This can be observed.

Sixth, clarifying the Nanshan School: This is divided into two sections. First, explaining and clarifying the patriarch's intention; second, distinctions among various approaches. First, explaining and clarifying the patriarch's intention: Master Nanshan's understanding and practice were transcendent, and he deeply lamented that the Tathāgata's true Dharma was being destroyed by contemporary corruptions. Earnestly seeking to restore the orthodox school of the Four Reliances and Noble Eightfold Path to the age of semblance and decline, to enable students to truly cultivate and actually practice according to the Three Studies, advancing toward the enlightenment of the Three Vehicles - such was the patriarch's intention. Now, to examine the patriarch's intention in detail, I briefly open five approaches. What are the five? First: revealing that the Three Studies are the correct track for studying Buddha-dharma, thereby closing off the eight wrong paths. Second: clarifying that the noble paths of all vehicles must be accomplished through subduing and extinguishing afflictions, thereby refuting false cultivation. Third: showing that lectures and explanations of vinaya matters often obstruct the work of the path, thereby encouraging correct cultivation. Fourth: clarifying that gradual entry into the secret treasury is the correct track of Śākyamuni's single transformation period, thereby warning against hesitating on the learning stages. Fifth: clarifying that the forty-two worthies and sages represent the accomplishment of the ten faiths of the emptiness school's true principle, mind-ground, and wisdom seal, only then advancing on this path, thereby disciplining premature calculations. First, revealing that the Three Studies are the correct path for studying Buddha-dharma, thereby closing off the eight wrong paths: This means that when the Three Studies open, they accomplish the Noble Eightfold Path. These Three Studies and Eightfold Path are inherent virtues of mind-nature, not creations of buddhas and patriarchs. Why is this so? Mind-nature possesses the unsurpassed path, great correct dharma, and great assembly's correct practices. These are precisely the luminous characteristic, tranquil

characteristic, equal and pure characteristic. All buddhas and tathāgatas manifest perfect enlightenment, accomplish this dharma, and also manifest awakening. All sentient beings completely possess this nature, with the three characteristics complete and no different from buddhas. However, due to ignorance and false movement, they manifest the arising of coarse and subtle kinds of three paths. The three characteristics of inherent virtue transform into the three characteristics of false aggregates - namely, the dull and dark characteristic, scattered and confused characteristic, and crooked and defiled characteristic. When false aggregates manifest, inherent virtue naturally becomes hidden, just like clouds covering the moon. Knowledge obstructions are like floating clouds obscuring; affliction obstructions are like great black clouds. The Tathāgata, pitying this deluded covering, manifests coarse and subtle kinds of dharmakāya in the most pure dharma realm. The coarse is the Two Vehicle path - this is the wisdom light of personal emptiness, teachings that counter affliction obstructions. The subtle is the Mahāyāna path - this is the wisdom light of the middle way of two emptinesses, teachings that counter both obstructions. Therefore, the Tathāgata's eighty-four thousand dharma treasuries are all great skillful means for countering the three characteristics of false aggregates and manifestly accomplishing the three characteristics of inherent virtue. However, setting aside other pure lands and great spiritual capacities for aspiring birth and responding birth, ordinary beings of Jambudvīpa during times of increasing five turbidities have dull faculties and heavy obstructions. Unless they first use the wisdom of personal emptiness to counter the inversion of self, there is no way to transform and abandon false aggregates and transform to obtain inherent virtue. The so-called wisdom of personal emptiness without outflows must necessarily be manifestly generated through contaminated precepts, concentration, and wisdom. When precepts purify body and speech, pure concentration naturally arises. When the concentrated mind becomes clear and pure, true brightness naturally manifests. When true brightness appears before one, the great mountain of ego-pride in personal-existence view is crushed and destroyed all at once. False aggregates are partially extinguished; inherent virtue is partially revealed. This is the initial [stage] of entering principle - an iron barrier extremely difficult to penetrate. Once this barrier is penetrated, subsequent superior paths progressively become ever clearer, like the rising sun emerging from clouds, with nothing more that is difficult. Therefore, our Buddha, the World-Honored One, took the Four Noble Truths and selfless person-dharmas as theoretical teachings, established precepts, concentration, and

【Fifty-fifth Page Lower Section】
wisdom as learning bases. This constitutes the correct track for one transformation period in Jambudvīpa. However, great beings such as Aśvaghoṣa, Nāgārjuna, Asaṅga, and Vasubandhu lamented that the corrupt practices of Tripiṭaka scholars would destroy the true Dharma, and having no choice, opened and developed the Mahāyāna secret treasury to illuminate and reveal the true meaning of the Tripiṭaka. However, this dharma eventually gave rise to corrupt practices over time, falsely denigrating the Tripiṭaka as Hīnayāna, casting aside the Three Studies as provisional cultivation. In extreme cases, [people] fell into vast emptiness and destroyed correct cause and effect. Mahāyāna sweet dew transformed into poison. Its harm was manifold compared to the corruptions of Tripiṭaka scholars. At this point, Nanshan extended his heaven-turning hand, supported this toppling and falling, presented the orthodox school of equally cultivating the Three Studies, thereby establishing the great standard for studying Buddha-dharma. How great indeed was his merit in protecting the Dharma! Second, clarifying that the noble paths of all vehicles must be accomplished through subduing and extinguishing afflictions, thereby refuting false cultivation: The covering and concealment by the two obstructions has already been clarified above. However, ordinary beings of the three realms with birth segments who wish to enter the noble paths of the Three Vehicles must first counter afflictions as the first barrier for entering principle. If this barrier is not yet penetrated, there is no way to advance on subsequent superior paths. The so-called afflictions have personal-existence view as their root, forming the two delusions of [wrong] views and thought[-desires]. When distinguished into branches, they become the ten [primary] afflictions, ninety-eight afflictions, one hundred and eight afflictions, and even eighty-four thousand dust-like troubles. However, these afflictions have followed sentient beings since beginningless time like shadows following movement, binding sentient beings like iron chains and nets. The dense mountains of [wrong] views are higher than Kunlun; the surging waters of craving are deeper than the ocean. The twenty-five forms of existence use these as fetters; the ninety-six paths come here and fold their hands [in surrender]. Only the wheel of the Four Noble Truths and personal selflessness can crush and destroy this great mother of disasters. Therefore, to eliminate these phenomenal obstructions, [the Buddha] concealed the secret and turned three times the great dharma wheel of ultimate meaning

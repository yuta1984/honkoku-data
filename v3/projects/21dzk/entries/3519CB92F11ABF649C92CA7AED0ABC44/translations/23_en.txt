There are distinctions between what is obtained through false consciousness, dependent contemplation, and uncontaminated attainments, etc. Distinguishing according to truth, etc.

Third, the True Pure Land refers to the first stage and above, up to the lands where all buddhas reside. This is the land of natural arising obtained by buddhas and bodhisattvas through actually realizing bodhi. It is wonderfully pure, free from defilement, permanent and unchanging. Therefore it is called "true purity." Because the causes are free from conditioned thoughts, the land has no characteristics. Like the jewel on top of Brahmā king's head having no blue, yellow, red, white or other characteristics, and like unmanifest form which, though it is form, has no obtainable characteristics. Because this land's causes have no fixed attachments, the land has no fixed location. Because the causes have no discrimination, the land has no distinctions of here and there, self and other.

Within this, there are three gates of distinction. First, distinguishing in contrast to delusion, divided into two: First, "truth free from delusion" refers to the true practices achieved by bodhisattvas that are obtained by departing from delusion, yet still merge with delusion, like space within fog. The lands differ according to stages, with unequal levels. Following the stages of the various grounds, they gradually increase portion by portion—deluded lands disappear and true lands gradually manifest, like fog gradually clearing and space becoming visible. Second, "purely clean truth" refers to the land where buddhas reside—purely true without mixture, like pure space.

Second, distinguishing according to practice: There are two essential practices—wisdom and compassion. Wisdom is perfected depending on emptiness. When wisdom encompasses practices, all practices transcend characteristics. The obtained lands are wonderfully tranquil and beyond characteristics, like space. Compassion arises following existence. When compassion encompasses practices, all practices are for beings. The obtained lands manifest according to beings, like a pure jewel that manifests all colors without lacking any.

Third, distinguishing according to dharma: Within the tathāgatagarbha there are two dharma gates. The land obtained through the cessation gate is identical to that dharma's cessation and transcendence of characteristics. The land obtained through the dependent origination and function gate manifests everything without exception, etc. According to truth, etc.

Next, explaining expansion and contraction from one to seven, extensively citing the Daśabhūmika Sūtra to clarify the seven kinds of purity, etc. In the third section distinguishing their causes,

first distinguishing the two lands of dharma and reward, then distinguishing response lands. In the first part, dividing characteristics to discuss them: Beginningless dharma-nature is the cause of dharma-land. The practices of perfections etc. are causes of reward-land. Speaking of encompassing characteristics, both lands use beginningless dharma-nature and perfections as causes. Within this, when contrasting conditions and primary causes, there are two gates: First, distinct characteristics. In explaining dharma-nature land, beginningless dharma-nature serves as the primary cause, and perfection practices serve as conditional causes. For reward land, perfection practices serve as primary causes, and because they directly generate it, dharma-nature serves as condition. Second, general characteristics. In explaining both lands, both use beginningless dharma-nature as primary cause. The originally existing dharma-essence serves as cause of dharma-land, and dharma-nature's inherent meaning of possible dependent origination serves as cause of reward-land. Both lands use perfection practices as conditional causes. Within this, perfections having the meaning of generation are conditions for reward-land. Perfections having the meaning of understanding are conditions for dharma-land.

Second, clarifying response lands: When encompassing function within essence, there are no separate causes. When dividing function as distinct from essence, causes are also explained. There are two kinds of causes: First, same-class causes—response practices serve as causes of response lands. Buddhas and tathāgatas obtained lands long ago and now cultivate practices to adorn pure lands, like Amitābha Buddha's land where he now cultivates the forty-eight great vows and various practices to adorn the Western World. Second, different-class causes—real practices and true dharma serve as causes of response lands.

However, within response there are two distinct meanings: First is dharma-response—through the power of pure land samādhi dharma gates, various buddha-fields are manifested. Second is reward-response—through the causal conditions of original great compassionate vow power, various lands are manifested. In distinguishing these two: dharma-response lands use the pure land dharma gates within the tathāgatagarbha as their cause; reward-response lands use great compassionate vow power as their cause. With compassionate vows as primary, they encompass all practices as causes.

Speaking of encompassing characteristics, both responses use pure land dharma gates and compassionate vows as causes. Distinguishing conditions and primary causes, etc.

Question: Response lands arise from real compassionate vow and dharma gate power. Why are they not called "true" but instead called "response"? Answer: Great compassionate vow power and practices correctly obtain true lands. Superior conditional power additionally generates response lands. Because they are not primary manifestations, they are not called "true." Conditional power generates them additionally to enable people to see and hear them, therefore they are called "response," etc. Fourth, clarifying lands according to bodies. Fifth, presence and absence of ordinary and sacred. Sixth, similarities and differences in substance, etc.

Second, the Huayan explanation: Taixuan, fascicle 3, clarifying types of worlds says: Hīnayāna has only one type—worlds like Sahā, etc.—without separate pure lands. In the three-vehicle teaching there are two types: First, regarding buddha's own dwelling places, there are three: 1) Dharma-nature land, 2) Jewel-virtue land (practices, etc.), 3) Form-characteristic land (excellent jewels, etc.). The latter two are self-enjoyment lands. These three are not places of conversion and transformation, so they are not discussed here.

Second, regarding buddha's places of conversion and transformation, there are also three: transformation-body lands, which have two types: 1) Defiled—like this Sahā world, etc. (regarding Śākyamuni), 2) Pure—pure transformation lands in other directions (regarding other buddhas). Second, transformed defiled lands—like pressing the earth with toe, etc. Third, other-enjoyment lands—like the eighteen perfections, etc.

Within the first two: If following the Initial Teaching, there are only billions of Jambudvīpas and billions of Śākyamunis as the realm of conversion and transformation. If following the Final Teaching, as in the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra, taking the great trichiliocosm as one unit, counting these up to Ganges sands makes one world-nature; counting these again up to Ganges sands makes one world-ocean; counting these again up to Ganges sands makes one world-seed; counting these again up to immeasurable Ganges sands makes the extent of one buddha's transformative activity. Regarding enjoyment

【Forty-seventh Page Lower Section】
lands: If following the Initial Teaching, they are at the summit of the form realm, explaining them as being in the same realm to guide Hīnayāna practitioners. If following the Final Teaching, they are not in the three realms. As the Nirvana Sūtra says: "To the west, thirty-two Ganges sands of buddha-lands away, there is a world called 'Unsurpassed'—this is Śākyamuni Buddha's true reward pure land." Also, throughout the borders between all Sumeru mountain worlds, pure buddha-lands are established here and there. These include both reward and transformation lands to guide sentient beings.

Third, according to the One Vehicle there are two types: First, regarding the fruit aspect—the ocean of the ten buddhas' intrinsic lands. This corresponds to the ineffable, provisionally explained as ten through dependent conditions, as explained in the second assembly. Second, regarding places of conversion, there are three categories: First category includes from Sumeru mountain worlds and tree-shaped worlds onward up to all sentient being-shaped worlds. Second, beyond the great trichiliocosm there are separately ten worlds: 1) world-nature, 2) world-ocean, 3) world-wheel, 4) world-perfection, 5) world-distinction, 6) world-rotation, 7) world-revolution, 8) world-lotus, 9) world-Sumeru, 10) world-characteristics. These correspond to wheel-turning king realms from ten thousand sons onward—the second category. Third, the lotus-treasury adorned world-ocean, complete with primary and supporting elements like Indra's net, etc.—this is the buddha realm, forming the third category. Also, the original commentary to the Brahmajāla Sūtra presents five explanations, etc.

Third, the Tiantai explanation: The Vimalakīrti Commentary says: "Second, separately clarifying buddha-lands: The distinctive characteristics of various buddha-fields are limitless and boundless. Now briefly dividing into four: 1) Defiled-pure lands where ordinary beings and sages dwell together, 2) Lands with remainder where expedient practitioners dwell, 3) Reward lands where pure dharma-bodies reside, 4) Eternally tranquil light where wonderful enlightenment resides. The first two are response lands—where response buddhas dwell. The third is both response and reward—where reward buddhas dwell. The latter

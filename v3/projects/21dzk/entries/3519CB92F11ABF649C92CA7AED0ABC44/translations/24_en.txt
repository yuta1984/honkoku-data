One is purely true purity, being neither reward nor response—this is where the dharma-body resides. Speaking of "defiled-pure" refers to the nine realms mixed together. What does this mean? The six realms are base and impure, hence called "defiled." The three vehicles see truth, hence called "pure." The three and six dwell together, hence called "defiled-pure," also named "the land where ordinary beings and sages dwell together." Regarding defiled-pure lands, both ordinary beings and sages have two types each. The two types of ordinary dwelling are: first, evil sentient beings—the four evil destinies; second, good sentient beings—humans and devas. The two types of sage dwelling are: first, real; second, provisional. Real sages are the four fruits, pratyekabuddhas, the six stages of the Shared Teaching, the ten abodes of the Distinct Teaching, and the ten faiths of the Perfect Teaching—though they have cut through common delusions in their final stages, their reward bodies still remain. Second, provisional sages are three-vehicle practitioners of the Land of Remaining Traces who receive partial-truth dharma-nature bodies and vow to be born in the common dwelling to benefit those with karmic connections. If practitioners of real dharma and dharma-body great beings of eternal tranquil light, as well as wonderfully enlightened buddhas, are born in the common dwelling in response to benefit sentient beings, these are all provisional. These sages dwell together with ordinary beings, hence called "ordinary beings and sages dwelling together." Since they dwell together with the four evil destinies, it is called "impure land."

First, clarifying lands where [ordinary and sages] dwell together purely: Though the Land of Immeasurable Life has supremely excellent rewards difficult to compare, it is still a place where defiled-pure ordinary beings and sages dwell together. How so? Though it lacks the four destinies, it has humans and devas. How do we know this? Those born in that land are not necessarily all people who have attained the Way. The provisional and real among sage-births can be understood as before. Simply because it lacks the four evil destinies, it is called "pure."

Second, clarifying lands with remainder: This is where two-vehicle practitioners and three types of bodhisattvas who have realized the expedient path dwell. How so? If one cultivates the two contemplations and completely cuts through common delusions, though the countless distinct delusions and fundamental ignorance remain uncut, one abandons the body of birth-and-death segments and is born beyond the [three] realms, receiving a dharma-nature body. Then there is the land of transformational existence dwelling, called "with remainder," also called "expedient"—where expedient

practitioners dwell.

Third, clarifying reward lands: This is Indra's net—the Lotus Treasury World where pure dharma-body bodhisattvas dwell. Through contemplating the one real truth, they break fundamental ignorance, manifest dharma-nature, and obtain true real reward. Though fundamental ignorance is not yet exhausted, they nourish uncontaminated karma and receive dharma-nature reward bodies. The pure land of dependent reward where reward bodies dwell is called "reward land." Because it is the reward obtained through contemplating true characteristics and generating true uncontaminated [wisdom], it is called "real." Since the causes of cultivation are not fixed, form and mind are unobstructed—also called "Real Reward Unobstructed Land." Speaking of "unobstructed" means one world encompasses all worlds, and all worlds are likewise. This is called "world-ocean," also called "inexhaustible treasury of worlds." When the first stage of the Distinct Teaching enters this world, there are seven kinds of purity meanings. The Avatamsaka clarifies Indra's net worlds, and the Mahāyāna-samgraha clarifies flower-king worlds, etc.

Fourth, clarifying eternally tranquil light land: The principle of the suchness dharma-realm illuminated by the ultimate wisdom of wonderful enlightenment is called "land." However, Mahāyāna dharma-nature is precisely true tranquil wisdom-nature, not the same as the partial-truth principle of the two vehicles. Therefore the Nirvana says: "Ultimate emptiness is called wisdom." This sutra says: "If one knows that the nature of ignorance is precisely enlightenment"—all such instances are meanings of eternal tranquil light. It is where inconceivable ultimate wisdom dwells, hence called "tranquil light," also called "dharma-nature land." However, true suchness buddha-nature is neither body nor land, yet we speak of body and land. Apart from body there is no land; apart from land there is no body. Calling it "land" is because of one dharma with two meanings. The Vajracchedikā commentary says: "Wisdom-cultivation penetrates consciousness-only; thus taking pure lands—not form as primary essence, not adornment as adornment's meaning," etc.

Fourth, the Yogācāra School's explanation: The sutras and treatises on which the Yogācāra School depends are not uniform in their explanations. For instance, the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra

【Forty-ninth Page Upper Section】
In fascicle 4 explains the characteristics of buddhahood at the summit of form; fascicle 78 explains the distinct characteristics of pure and impure lands; the beginning of fascicle 79 explains the distinctions between pure and impure buddha-fields. When it speaks of "pure lands" and "pure buddha-fields," it refers to lands where above-ground bodhisattvas dwell. When it speaks of "impure lands" and "impure buddha-fields," it specifically refers to the Sahā world. There are no other texts that separately clarify buddha-bodies and lands. The Abhidharma-samuccaya fascicle 6, the Mahāyāna-sūtra-alamkāra fascicle 3, the Liang translation of Mahāyāna-samgraha fascicle 16, the Tang translation fascicle 9, the Vijñāptimātra-trimsikā fascicle 10, and the Buddha-bhūmi-sūtra-śāstra fascicle 1 extensively clarify bodies and lands, etc. The four lands clarified by the Consciousness-Only and Buddha-Land [treatises] differ somewhat from the ancient Abhidharma, as discussed elsewhere.

Second, separately clarifying Amitābha Buddha's land: Sutras, treatises, and commentators' judgments of Amitābha Buddha's land involve various conflicting interpretations. In sutras, some explain it as reward land, such as the Mahāyāna-sama-dharma-sūtra, Mahākausthila-sūtra, Compassionate Lotus Sūtra, Lankāvatāra-sūtra, Avatamsaka-sūtra's Chapter on Lifespan, etc. The Asvabhāva commentary on the Mahāyāna-samgraha fascicle 9 and Buddha-bhūmi-sūtra fascicle 1 agree. Some explain it as transformed land, like the Drum-Sound Sūtra, etc. Some say it encompasses both types, like the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra, etc. Various masters' judgments on the three Pure Land sutras are not uniform. Like the Rebirth Treatise, the practices of the five gates progress from shallow to deep, seeming to encompass both reward and transformation lands. Tiantai judges it as the highest grade pure land where ordinary beings and sages dwell together. Jingying judges it as phenomenal pure land. Zhixiang says: "Amitābha Buddha differs between One Vehicle and Three Vehicle [interpretations]. According to the One Vehicle, Amitābha Buddha's land belongs to the world-ocean category," and "According to the Three Vehicle, the Western pure [land] is truly a reward place, encompassing four lands: 1) dharma-nature land, 2) phenomenal pure land, 3) real reward land, 4) transformed pure land. These are reward and transformation, not transformation-body transformation," etc. The Rebirth Collection and Commentary on the Contemplation Sutra

【Forty-ninth Page Lower Section】
judge it as reward, not transformation. What is explained in the Commentary is profoundly mysterious in its intent. At first glance, it seems to conflict with the common understanding of nature and characteristics schools, but when properly understood, there is no contradiction. One should consider Fashi's Forest of Meanings on Buddha-Lands, which uses two interpretations to judge Amitābha Buddha's land, citing the true body contemplation from the Contemplation Sutra to prove it is other-enjoyment land, and citing the Drum-Sound Sūtra to prove there are transformation lands, etc.

The Treatise on Resolving Doubts fascicle 1 presents three explanations: First, the Western Paradise is other-enjoyment land, etc. Second, it is transformation land, etc. Third, it encompasses both lands—those below the [bodhisattva] stages see transformation land, while those above the stages see other-enjoyment land, etc. Regarding whether the West is included in or separate from the three realms, and the positions of the nine grades of people in the Contemplation Sutra, etc.—the various explanations are so numerous and conflicting that there is no time to record them here. This concludes the brief discussion of pure lands.

Fourth, the practices and causes for rebirth: This also divides into two parts. First, generally clarifying the practices and causes for pure lands. Second, separately clarifying the exclusive cultivation of Amitābha's dharma. First, generally clarifying pure land practices and causes: This means generating bodhicitta, seeking rebirth in pure lands to achieve bodhi, accordingly practicing the myriad practices of merit and wisdom while dedicating [merit] to pure lands. This constitutes the karmic causes for pure lands. The Contemplation of Immeasurable Life Sutra explains three types of merit as the correct causes of pure karma for buddhas of the three periods. Among these, the six perfections and thirty-seven factors of enlightenment, etc., serve as fundamental practices. Down to the smallest worldly good deeds, all can be redirected as causes. The Vimalakīrti Sūtra says: "Generating supreme bodhicitta is precisely how bodhisattvas purify and adorn buddha-lands. When bodhisattvas attain great bodhi, all sentient beings who have set out toward the Great Vehicle will be born in their land." Pure aspiration, good applied practices, superior aspiration, the six perfections, four immeasurables, four means of attraction, skillful expedients, and the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are cultivated and dedicated.

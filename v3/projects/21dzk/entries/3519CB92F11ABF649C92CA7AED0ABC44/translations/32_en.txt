Therefore, taking vinaya as the foundation, this can be called the wondrous school that extensively propagates all teachings and universally embraces all capacities. Just as those virtuous masters like Tiantai, Xianshou, and Shanwuwei established their schools based on the most perfect principles to reveal all vehicle teachings, Nanshan established his school based on the fundamental common track to expound the dharma treasury of one lifetime. Though their methods differ, their principles converge to one path. However, the doctrinal principles established by the four schools were pure in source and balanced, but were later obscured by those who grasped their own dharmas, and their truth gradually became hidden. Among them, Nanshan's descendants suffered particularly severe problems: some recklessly explained "opening and merging," competing in subtlety with other schools; some one-sidedly praised vinaya while cutting off prajñā study; some grasped trivial precepts and deportment without cultivating meditation and wisdom, etc. This stems from not understanding the original intention of our school's establishment of vinaya as foundation. It also relates to not fully knowing that Nanshan's praise of vinaya is because the precept-dharma has the capacity to generate concentration and wisdom. One should understand. Second, regarding lineage transmission: when the Tathāgata was in the world, the dharma-path was unified; after his passing it divided into schools as already clarified above. After the vinaya collection was transmitted and translated, various masters transmitted it through nine generations. Master Puning first established five patriarchs: first Upāli, second Fazhen, third Jueming, fourth Zhishou, fifth Nanshan. Next, Master Zhaoxi established ten patriarchs, Dharma Master Lingyuan established six patriarchs, Vinaya Master Yunkan established seven patriarchs. Lingzhi refuted each master's establishment and himself established nine patriarchs: first Dharmagupta, second Fashi, third Facong, fourth Daofu, fifth Huiguang, sixth Daoyun, seventh Daohong, eighth Zhishou, ninth Nanshan. This is detailed in the Remaining Chapters of Zhiyuan. Ji said: Lingzhi's listed nine patriarchs are merely the patriarchal succession of Dharmaguptaka vinaya transmission, not the sectarian succession established by Nanshan. Why is this? Because

Nanshan's established orthodox school intended to restore the pure source of balanced cultivation of the three studies to the semblance and final dharma age, distantly inheriting the sectarian lineage of the five masters of different periods and Venerable Fazhen. How could one list Fashi through Zhishou among the sectarian patriarchs? Question: Where in Nanshan's commentaries is there such explanation? Answer: In the ten sections of the Shijiao Commentary, the upper volume of the Precept Commentary, and the Pure Mind Admonishing Contemplation, this principle appears frequently. When the Shijiao Commentary clarifies the sequence of vinaya transmission, it lists twenty-six previous schools, immediately saying: "Study has its inheritance; inheritance must know its source." But this merely shows the patriarchal succession of Dharmaguptaka transmission. As for establishing his own sectarian tradition, he distantly inherited from Venerable Fazhen; the rest were not his concern. The Precept Commentary says: "The five masters of the same period - the times being shallow and corrupt, emotional views arose mutually. Though they penetrated the small sage path, they were not without sharp and dull differences. Mādhyantika received the dharma but gradually became inferior to his teacher. Yaśa raised his hand but could not determine the characteristics. This caused all five to rely on mental views - how could they achieve opening and penetration? Being lax and not questioning, they finally divided into five schools." The Shijiao Commentary also says: "The five masters gathered and selected but their emotional views were not the same." It also says: "Reaching the semblance period, times became increasingly shallow and false, competing in argument through words, drumming up discussions of formless matters. Therefore, the nine generations of Zhènlǐng transmission only heard techniques of exceptional distinction." It also says: "Looking at the various treatises, none accord with intention." It also says: "Since Buddhism flowed east, nearly six hundred years have passed. Various masters have speculated and fabricated, judging right and wrong, competitively sealing off similarities and differences - this cannot be adequately described. This is because those who investigate do not recognize the doctrinal purport, and those who practice are unclear about the fundamental aim. Therefore, those who study must base themselves on the eternal classics, and those who grasp teachings must wear the true texts," etc. Based on this textual meaning, all masters from Fazhen onward were not those whom our current master

inherited as patriarchs, as can be known. Question: Regarding the six Indian masters, Nanshan was separated by generations and vast distances, yet connected them as patriarchal inheritance - are there examples of this? Answer: Such examples are already numerous. Like the meditation master Wen of Northern Qi and Master Dushun of Tang, who distantly received inheritance from Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva. Like the ancient stupa master who distantly succeeded Yunmen. The dharma-path's harmonious meeting is like water joining water - this can be called master-disciple mutual inheritance. How could one necessarily wait for one foolish flesh-body to bump into another foolish flesh-body to constitute dharma succession? Question: The text of the commentaries seems not to fully approve of the five masters of the same period. Why now inherit from Venerable Fazhen? Answer: Indeed as you ask. However, the five masters of the same period all attained sage fruits and their path met the true source. Moreover, Master Fazhen wonderfully understood expedient and ultimate, comprehensively gathered name and principle, and his path accorded with previous sages. Therefore, relying on the Dharmaguptaka, he established the standards for restraint and performance. Logically he should be taken as patriarchal inheritance. One should contemplate this.

Ji said: The text of Nanshan's commentaries, at first glance, seems to merely have praise and criticism, acceptance and rejection regarding vinaya practice and protection. Upon careful consideration, the intention lies in rejecting the emotional views of the contemporary world in order to revive the orthodox school of the five masters of different periods who equally cultivated the three studies.

Third, regarding doctrinal purport: taking the great path of equally cultivating the three studies as the foundation, with the aim of subduing the three poisons, realizing the four fruits, and advancing toward the Mahāyāna great bodhi path. Nanshan's foundation is as described above. Taking vinaya as foundation means that vinaya is the great earth of Buddha-dharma, from which myriad virtues grow. Also, vinaya is the great teacher after the Buddha's passing, what all Buddha-disciples depend upon for dwelling. Also, vinaya is the common track of śramaṇas. Also, vinaya is the dharma commonly studied by the three vehicles. Also,

it corrects the harm of those in the contemporary world who recklessly claim Mahāyāna while obliterating vinaya. Having such various reasons, vinaya is taken as foundation. This is definitely not one-sidedly grasping vinaya to establish the school. Question: Equal cultivation of the three studies is the pure transformation of true dharma. Our school taking this as foundation is logically admirable. Please provide textual proof. Answer: Textual proofs are quite numerous. Now I'll present a couple. The first volume of the Precept Commentary says: "The great sage descended and initially opened the foundation of transformation. Intending to rescue and deliver all existence, causing them equally to reach the other shore. Establishing precepts for the path was originally not for worldly merit. However, afflictions and delusions are difficult to purify, necessarily requiring expedient means, establishing the three studies as treatment for the root cause. Therefore the Satyasiddhi says: precepts are like catching thieves, concentration binds them, wisdom kills them. The three practices are mutually dependent and must be integrated. Therefore, bodily and verbal actions constantly violate principle. If not first prevented, one falsely follows dust and desires, then the mind-path becomes agitated and disturbed - how could still concentration arise? If concentration is not cultivated, then regarding the various self-inversions, there is no mind for discernment and selection, clear wisdom naturally hides, and there is no way to meet correctness. Therefore, beginning practitioners must first diligently study precepts, examining and restraining what is wrong and distant. With the three actions purified, right concentration and right wisdom naturally establish. Therefore the sutra says: 'Depending and relying on these precepts, the latter two are generated. Without these precepts, various virtues do not arise.'" Question: Reasoning through principle, precepts calm the three evil destinies, concentration eliminates desire-realm existence, wisdom is not bound by the realms - how can you say above that they are for the path and not merit? Answer: One must understand the distant intention. Investigating the Buddha's descent to the world, how could it be to increase birth? The Yogācāra treatise says: "Precepts are conditioned, contaminated, worldly dharmas." If the original intention of establishment was as expedient for the path, the sages of three vehicles necessarily follow this track. Therefore the vinaya says: "To subdue the three poisons and cause their exhaustion, the increased precept-study is established." The Mahāvibhāṣā also says: "To open the nirvana gate, precepts are established." The text below says: "With pure precepts and wisdom, one attains the first path."

corruptions, and definitely not rejecting the wisdom seals of the Tathāgata's ocean of nature or the true dharma of universal skillful means. Can this be called the secret technique of stripping away the yang while secretly supporting the yin? However, from Shaolin to Caoxi, the great Chan masters, after attaining awakening, withdrew in seclusion for cultivation and did not necessarily engage in establishing schools or founding lineages. When they occasionally encountered those of great capacity, they responded according to conditions, sometimes explaining principles and reasoning, sometimes demonstrating key points. Things like the Six Gates of Shaoshi are quite similar in general meaning to the cultivation and realization within the teachings. I hear there are disputes about the authenticity of this text, but Ji has not yet determined which is correct. When carefully examining what the ancient Chan masters advocated, although they spoke of "outside the teachings" and "not establishing written words," their meaning harmonized with the vaipulya sūtras and treatises like matching tally pieces. When they occasionally spoke about the meanings of sūtras and treatises, often even those who studied the teachings could hardly match them. Also, like how the First Patriarch sealed the mind with the Laṅkāvatāra and Caoxi sealed the mind with the Diamond Sūtra, their reverence for the sūtra-dharma can be observed. After Caoxi, the various elders like Zhaozhou, Huangbo, Linji, and Yunmen, fearing that principles and reasoning might fall into emotional nests, simply raised up the transcendent, standing like ten-thousand-foot cliffs. When they dropped a word or half a phrase, it was like wooden chips in soup that cannot be tasted, like a great fire mass that cannot be touched, like the moon in water that cannot be grasped. They wanted students to take up that which is beyond thought, to chew and bite what has no flavor, to stand on ten-thousand-foot precipices, release the body and lose life, and instantly extinguish the poisonous roots of the skandhas and realms. This directly corresponds to the essential aim of sudden teaching Mahāyāna in receiving those of the highest great capacity. What is there to find strange? Therefore it is called the secret technique of stripping yang while secretly supporting yin. However, this school is what can be endured and received by those who possess great root-nature, arouse great faith-mind, and

harbor great way-seeking mind. If those with dull roots, heavy obstructions, and weak way-seeking mind receive this school, not only will they have no merit of progress, but they will frequently generate many transgressions. Some borrow words about transcendence to criticize and reject the vinaya, use the pretext of "not establishing" to despise and abandon sūtras and treatises, or fall into vast emptiness and deny cause and effect, or falsely proclaim superhuman dharmas and commit great lies, talking about Vairocana's crown while their minds sink to the bottom of Avīci hell - such cases occur frequently. It is like a three-year-old child grasping the sword of Moye without knowing how to use it, instead injuring themselves. Therefore the Sixth Patriarch said: "When people of small roots hear this sudden teaching, it is like plants and trees with small root-nature - if struck by heavy rain, they all fall over and cannot grow." How profound these words are! They are truly a mirror for these practitioners.

Since Dharmarakṣa Tripiṭaka transmitted the vinaya, the four vinayas and five treatises were successively translated. Through nine generations of inheritance, worthy ones like Facong, Daofu, and Huiguang continued the transmission, mostly propagating the Dharmaguptaka. At the beginning of the Tang, three schools stood like a tripod: first, the Xiangbu school; second, the Nanshan school; third, the Dongta school. Although Xiangbu and Dongta flourished for a time, they later declined and were in danger of extinction. Only the Nanshan school prospered in the world, with continuous succession and descendants like deer. Nanshan took vinaya as its foundation, and regarding the gates of concentration and wisdom, it established three schools, teaching according to capacity and presenting the correct track of Jambudvīpa's single transformation, seeking to revive the pure transformation of the Buddha's lifetime and the five sages of the true dharma period. Its intention was supreme and its meaning was subtle. What is regrettable is that in later generations, among the families transmitting this school, their propagation used similar words but

【Eleventh Page Upper Section】
their aims were as different as heaven and earth. How regrettable!

When the various schools were practiced in the world, they mutually generated transformations and deviations from the patriarchs' intentions - this was probably what the times made inevitable. The transformations of the Nanshan school were particularly severe, which will be discussed at the appropriate time.

In the Jin Dynasty there was Dharma Master Huiyuan who established the Lotus Society at Mount Lushan, cultivating the Buddha-recollection samādhi and universally encouraging monastics and laypeople to plant pure land causes. From then onward, worthy ones like Xuanzhong, Jiacai, Xihe, and Wuzhen successively propagated this teaching through the generations. Among the masters of Tiantai, Huayan, Chan, and Vinaya schools, very many believed in and received this teaching. This dharma properly relies on the three Infinite Life sūtras, and secondarily relies on various sūtras praising the pure land. Aśvaghoṣa demonstrated it in the Awakening of Faith, Nāgārjuna revealed it in the Ten Stages, and Ācārya Vasubandhu composed the Treatise on Rebirth in the Pure Land to explain this teaching. The stages of dwelling, returning, and dedication show the wonderful practices of five gates; extensive and abbreviated mutual inclusion expands the mysterious teaching of the two truths. This is truly the model of the pure teaching and the boat and raft of the sea of suffering. Dharma Master Tanluan's commentary divides sections for explanation, being simple, easy, clear, and fluent, and also able to correspond with the conditions of the time. He can be called a skillful hand. This teaching's benefit to the degenerate age lies in skillfully embracing the three root-capacities. If those of superior root-nature receive this teaching, they quickly attain profound samādhi, instantly subdue and eliminate the two obstructions, and awaken to the forbearance of the unborn dharma. If those of middle and lower roots receive this teaching, they sharpen their aspiration in renunciation and aspiration, focus their minds on contemplation and recitation, either develop samādhi or distinguish past karma, are reborn in the pure land, and after reaching that country, realize non-retrogression, enter the three worthy stages, and accomplish the ten-ground path. Therefore, for the category suitable to receive this teaching, they should master the various Mahāyāna schools while practicing and studying it. As for those who separately establish the pure teaching as a

【Eleventh Page Lower Section】
school lineage, this is probably a secret technique of applying timely skillful means to embrace those of the lowest capacity. How marvelous is this teaching! Its words are close but its meaning distant; its merit is high but progress is easy. It comprehensively embraces the five vehicles while universally taking in the ocean of vows; riding on one mind, it quickly takes refuge in the lotus womb. It is truly sweet dew that moistens the withered beings of the degenerate age.

This teaching has also, over time, generated corruptions that must be addressed. This will be known at the appropriate time.

The general outline of propagation in China was thus, and the transmission in Japan was divided into ten schools as recorded in the histories. I will not repeat this now. All the above teachings are true dharma teachings that are equal flows from the most pure dharma realm, according with the dharma seals and following the principle of truth. Those who practice according to these teachings as explained will, whether near or far, appropriately transform and abandon the two kinds of birth-and-death and obtain the bodhi of the three vehicles.

Question: That the various teachings are all true explanations of universal skillful means and the wonderful dharma of the same sweet dew - I deeply understand this meaning. What is not yet clear is: if the various patriarchs from the past had methods in establishing teachings and sequences in entering the path, would this not conflict with the correct track of the great sage's transformative teaching?

Answer: Regarding the great masters of the Dharma Treasury lineage in India, there is naturally nothing to discuss. The various schools and patriarchs of China and Japan were identical in essence to the provisional and ultimate within the Tathāgata-garbha essence, each establishing their own gate and spreading the great teaching net to gather all beings. Their paths were practiced simultaneously without contradicting each other. It is like fishermen who wait quietly while others knock on boats - though their methods differ, obtaining fish is the same. When they established theories of praise, criticism, establishment, and refutation, competing with arguments between self and other, this was skillful means at the beginning of founding enterprises and establishing lineages to make their followers focus their minds on their own school, not daring to grasp one path and one practice while destroying other paths and practices. Later students mostly did not understand the patriarchs' intentions and increasingly added to the promotion of their own schools while denigrating other teachings.

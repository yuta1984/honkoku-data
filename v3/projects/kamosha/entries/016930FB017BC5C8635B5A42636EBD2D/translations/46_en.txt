28th day, Tsuchi-no-to-Tora, clear. Since early May of this year no rain has fallen, and due to the severe drought of recent years, river water has dried up and rice fields are gradually withering. Due to this, prayer rituals have been ordered since last month, but still no rain falls. Regarding this, today the shrine community is conducting rain-begging rituals. I did not attend due to illness, and my second son Oji Chiyo went out for the first time.

People came from Upper Kuga village to announce themselves, and by palanquin before Katsura River, only the village headman of Upper Namega and below, two or three head farmers came to greet us. At the morning hour, we arrived at the residence of Upper Kuga village headman Sōemon, finished lunch and sake, then went to inspect the rice fields. We walked, with Kan-kasadani accompanying us, guided by the village headman with head farmer Ichirōemon and one or two others attending. We inspected each rice field and completed the preliminary survey records. Around the half-hour of Monkey, we returned to the headman's residence to lodge, where sake and rice were served, dinner trays were provided, and fish dishes and other items were very hospitably prepared. However, since both villages had abundant harvests this year, and this being Kyōsen's first time, the hospitality was particularly special. From all the farmers and also from the head farmers, there were gifts of persimmons to the three of us as customary, and at nightfall, the village headman and village elders from Lower Kuga village came to pay their respects.

9th day, Hinoto-Mi, clear. After finishing morning rice, we headed to the rice fields, everything generally as yesterday. We had the roadside imperial villa grounds and sacred grove shown to us for viewing, finished midday meal and sake at the headman's residence. There was some inspection in the afternoon, and the crop inspection record comparison for Upper Kuga's portion of over 150 koku was completed. We received two preliminary survey ledgers from the farmers' side. However, the method of this crop inspection follows old customs and is quite careless. How troublesome. From there it went to the lower review. Most importantly, down to the field paths, Lower Kuga village headman Hachirōbei, village elders and below came to greet us, and we immediately began the rice field inspection. After everyone's viewing, we completed comparison with the preliminary survey records. Taking this opportunity, we also inspected one newly built farmer's house this year. Around the half-hour of Monkey, we went to headman Hachirōbei's residence to lodge, with dinner trays and below, sake and appetizers, roughly as in the upper village.

10th day, Tsuchinoe-Uma, clear. From past the hour of Dragon we headed to the rice fields, all matters as yesterday. We finished midday meal at the headman's residence, then again went to inspect the rice fields. Today we wore leather boots in the muddy areas. At evening, we completely finished the crop inspection record comparison for Lower Kuga's portion of over 160 koku, and received two preliminary survey ledgers from the farmers' side as in the upper village. Today we also inspected one newly built farmer's house along the way. Most importantly, both of yesterday and today's building inspections were for two houses that had previously submitted applications with floor plans and received approval. After completing these matters, we returned to the headman's residence to lodge with sake and meal hospitality, and at nightfall the village headman and elders from the upper village came to pay respects. However, both Kuga villages had very abundant harvests this year due to good water supply. Most auspicious indeed.

11th day, Tsuchinoto-Hitsuji, beautifully clear. From all the farmers and also Hachirōbei and others, there were customary gifts to the three of us, at the hour of Dragon.

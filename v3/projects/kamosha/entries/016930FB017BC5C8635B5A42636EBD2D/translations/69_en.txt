One bamboo blind appeared with what looked like burn marks from sulfur, with scorch marks about one shaku in the middle section. Around half past the Hour of the Monkey, a blue-robed samurai discovered this during his rounds and reported it. Originally, there have been repeated careless incidents since some days past, so this evening all attendants from close retainers upward were summoned, and each is still under investigation before His Lordship. Due to this, those on duty are maintaining sleepless watch, the blue-robed samurai are periodically patrolling toward the sleeping quarters during the night, and from tonight onward one companion and two servants each are ordered to patrol for one hour each around the garden area and up to the front entrance of the late Mandokoro's residence. Since there are few companions, the kitchen staff joined in, and those off duty withdrew around the Hour of the Rat. As it was late into the night, they did not return to their lodgings.

Last day, Kinoto-I, clear - Around the Hour of the Sheep there was a brief thunder and light rain. The family residence has been troubled by disturbances lately. Specifically, on the nights of the 11th, 15th, 17th and others of this month, thieves broke into the shrine offering room, and kitchen knives, thin mats, and various other items went missing. Subsequently, on the night of the 18th, Tachikawa Tonomo's short sword went missing from the close retainer's room. Regarding the loss of Tonomo's short sword, on the 23rd, Ijichi Saburōemon from Okazaki village was privately asked to investigate down to the lowest servant Kurihata Kobunta. For the inner areas, two servants each were assigned sleepless watch duty, and the locks and keys for all gates at the rear, front, and entrances were ordered to be strictly secured. Nevertheless, yesterday there was another incident of carelessness with fire around the palace area, so additional night patrols with one companion and two servants each were ordered. However, given the repeated intrusions by thieves and especially the fire prevention matter being equally serious, this situation cannot be left unaddressed. This morning, after consultation among all the senior officials and both offices, it was decided that for investigating these thefts, Hagino Shichirōemon, who has access to the residence, should be privately ordered to conduct an investigation. This was reported and approved, and this morning Okazaki Taitō went to his place and conveyed these instructions.

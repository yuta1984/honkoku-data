16th Day, Hinoto-Hitsuji, Clear - Regarding the completion of Chishirō's succession to the Horikawa family name as petitioned, Danjō sent congratulatory gifts to our household: one box of fans (containing three fans), one serving of fresh sea bream, 200 mon in money, with a four-fold catalog attached, delivered via wooden carrier. These were forwarded today by the main family's Ōmi-no-kami. It was originally arranged that Danjō would personally deliver these gifts to our household, at which time celebratory sake would also be offered, and our household would likewise present reciprocal gifts and celebratory lodging. However, Danjō had urgent business and departed for distant parts yesterday, the 15th, with his return to Kyoto not expected until early next month. Therefore, the celebratory sake arrangement was unavoidably postponed and delayed. Accordingly, I sent the person in question congratulatory gifts of prepared fish worth 100 mon and two folded sheets of half-paper. Furthermore, regarding the completion of this matter as petitioned, Danjō sent a written document concerning future arrangements, which I had previously requested through Ōmi-no-kami. This was delivered today together with the congratulatory gifts. A copy is as follows:

Certificate
Regarding this matter: Due to my illness, I have petitioned for leave from palace service for convalescence. However, as there was no heir to the family name, your youngest son Chishirō-sama's succession to the family name has been granted as petitioned. Therefore, I hereby retire from service. Henceforth, in my personal capacity, I shall not in any way interfere with official matters. I record this for posterity. As above.
Bunsei 12, Year of the Ox, 9th Month - Horikawa Danjō (seal)
To Lord Kondō Oribe

17th Day, Tsuchinoe-Saru - To reply to Horikawa Danjō's household, while he was away, I dressed in formal hemp attire, took along one servant, and went to meet his mother. As congratulatory gifts, I presented one box of fans (containing three fans), one serving of fresh sea bream, 100 mon in money, with a four-fold catalog attached, all received and sent via wooden carrier as reciprocal gifts. Both parties followed Ōmi-no-kami's instructions in this manner. Additionally, as Danjō had requested that our household also provide a written document regarding future arrangements, I brought and delivered this today as well. At that time, celebratory refreshments were served and we held a formal gathering. However, no congratulatory gifts were given to the accompanying servants. Later, Ōmi-no-kami sent four mon in copper coins and two folded sheets of half-paper.

A copy of the written document sent from our household today is as follows (on Uda four-fold paper):

The inspection of our shrine was cancelled, etc. However, the lower shrine had no such issue and the inspection was conducted, which we respectfully acknowledged, etc. What to make of this?

21st day, kinoto-mi, rain. Since His Excellency of the Imperial Family was to receive imperial instruction on classical poetry (Kokin) from the Sentō Imperial Palace today, he began work from the hour of the rabbit (6 AM). His Majesty the Retired Emperor made an imperial visit at the hour of the snake (10 AM), traveling by imperial palanquin with lacquered Chinese chest and Koho in attendance. He returned at half past the hour of the sheep (2:30 PM), and at half past the hour of the monkey (4:30 PM) made another visit to various palaces for courtesy calls, with the usual retinue. The Young Lord made an imperial visit around the early hour of the horse (noon) for courtesy calls and returned immediately. The court nobles of the tea ceremony master's house, imperial court officials, and ministers who are disciples of the poetry school appeared, and celebratory sake was served. Tsunachi served as intermediary all day and withdrew around the hour of the boar (10 PM).

23rd day, hinoto-mi, clear. Regarding the inspection of our shrine by Senior Councilor Lord Mizuno Dewa-no-kami, he had refrained while in light mourning, but having completed the mourning period, today he inspected the lower shrine, then Mizoro Pond, Kifune, Kurama, and next our shrine, etc. ○ Today Tsunachi is on duty at the shrine grounds. He requested Teisei to serve as substitute.
○ Today the Young Lord of the Imperial Family and Lord Kuga Shōshō (actually the younger brother of the Young Lord) visited our shrine together, going to Koho's pavilion. Accordingly, Tsunachi went to his residence in formal hemp dress from early morning. The visit occurred at the early hour of the dragon (8 AM), and after a short while they went to the Shigeri bird hunting grounds. After viewing the birds, they had lunch at Koho's place, then made the shrine visit with Koho as guide. Next they stopped at Tsunachi's residence, where they were presented with delicacies (one throat of sea eel), thirty steamed buns, etc. This was notably the first such visit. Due to my father's illness and Yasuko's ritual impurity from childbirth, an audience was granted to mother and the children, to whom tea sweets (sweet bean jelly), small birds (thirty each, second row), persimmons, etc. were offered. After a while they went again to Koho's place, taking along the children Kennya, Jakujū, Jūdai, Miyūtarō, etc., and bestowed various entertainments upon each. With sake and evening meal, they returned at the early hour of the cock (6 PM).
○ Since Tsunachi's illness had mostly recovered and he should report for duty to the Imperial Family, but due to father's recent indisposition, he requested on the 21st (day before yesterday) to continue his absence for a while longer, and this request was immediately granted.

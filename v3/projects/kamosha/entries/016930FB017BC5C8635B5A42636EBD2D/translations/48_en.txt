Continuing from the inner quarters, the Ōmandokoro came to pay respects and had an audience, with gifts bestowed, retiring at the Hour of the Monkey. Then, accompanied by Kyōsen, I visited the Seyaku-in, and next went to the Horikawa Gōshū residence where celebratory sake and rice were served. In the evening, I took both children to visit Lord Otsugijibei's residence where celebratory sake was served, though Jirō was away on business in Shimosakka. At the same place, I observed the festival ritual, then stopped by the Horikawa residence again before returning home shortly after. On the way home past the Hour of the Dog, it rained lightly.

Father took Kameshirō and retainer Suekiyo Kiryū and went to inspect. The rice fields were assessed at 40%, with the remaining dry fields at 60% and 35%. In the afternoon, the tenant farmer came to inquire, and when told it was 40%, after discussion it was settled at 35%.  ○Regarding the Shibata music fee rice fields, tenant Yasuzo petitioned about drought damage this year, but upon inquiry it was reported as a complete loss. Yesterday, father immediately went to the shrine community and reported that due to sun damage to the Shibata music fee rice fields, a petition had been submitted by lower officials requesting an official inspection, which was conveyed to Kyōeki at the meeting place.

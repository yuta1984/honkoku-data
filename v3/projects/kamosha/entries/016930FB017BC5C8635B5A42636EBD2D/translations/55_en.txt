I had established close relations up to the head clerk. Today was the general reception for the second shift. At the early hour of the Rabbit, I inserted shade vines and sacred sakaki branches and proceeded to duty. Five duty officers gathered for reception: Kyōsen representing Bunkyō, Tadaki representing Dōsei, Masaaki representing Shikiken, Masaki representing Seikō, and Seishi and others assembled. After the top three withdrew, I was immediately ordered to visit the shrine as usual, completed the sequential worship up to Ōta Shrine, and then went directly to the second shift. This morning there was a sake offering from father and son as customary, and today about thirty households made sake offerings. During the day there was reception, and the second shift changeover was as usual, though I reported for duty somewhat early. Also today, Shikiken was in charge of the evening meal duty. Due to close relations, we arranged to have lunch together during our shift, so everyone didn't need to bring lunch boxes. We stopped the dengaku and had lunch with tofu soup. The three second-shift members rested for a short while as usual, and around half past the hour of the Sheep, the third drum was beaten and shrine personnel came on duty, so we immediately reported for duty. Around half past the hour of the Monkey, the doors of both halls were opened, and divine offerings were presented to the inner and outer sanctuaries and courtyard as customary. Due to the Kifune priest's absence from duty, Deputy Envoy Hōsei served. Before the hour of the Dog, Imperial Envoy Anekōji Right Middle Captain Kimi-tsui Asomi and others, along with dancers, attendants, and various officials, proceeded and completed the ritual procedures. After the scattering ceremony, following the offerings to both halls, the duty shrine official Ōta Priest Shinsei made evening offerings to the outer sanctuary, and the duty personnel made rotational offerings. The ceremonial duties at Kataoka Shrine, Shingū Shrine, Wakamiya Shrine and others were also completed as customary. The Imperial Envoy and others departed from the shrine precincts around half past the hour of the Boar, and all matters were completed without incident - most auspicious indeed.

However, among those on duty, Seishi was given leave and withdrew before the hour of the Rat because tomorrow the 21st is an anniversary of death.

However, since Kyōsen was supposed to be on evening meal duty next month, but head officer Dōho has been indisposed recently, I sent someone for evening meal duty today. ○ Regarding the completion of the waterwheel construction in Okazaki village in the domain, after breakfast six officials from both kitchen departments assembled and went to inspect it, naturally all wearing haori and hakama. ○ Regarding being invited to the soup gathering of the five headmen Shiken on the coming 27th.

The door opening ceremony was performed to inspect the inner sanctuary, and more details should be sought in the records. ○ Regarding Yasutoshi, the adopted son of the late Tsunaoka County Master of Ōtsu, due to circumstances of misconduct, he was temporarily placed with his biological father Yasunaka from the day before yesterday, the 23rd, as announced by Tsunetake.

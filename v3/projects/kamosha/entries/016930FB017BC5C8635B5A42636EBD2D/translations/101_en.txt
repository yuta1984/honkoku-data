Medicine was prepared and administered concurrently, and from the 10th day I requested examination by the court physician (jikishin), who prepared medicine for consumption. This quickly showed appropriate effects, and from the 11th day his appetite improved and he gradually recovered. However, on the 15th day food became somewhat stagnant again and he was unwell, so I personally summoned the court physician for examination and medication, leading to gradual recovery. Nevertheless, due to his advanced age, from today I again requested prayers for longevity at Ota Shrine through the five-head person Hitsukan. ○Due to my father's illness, I declined the family guard duty accommodation and stayed at the lower lodging.

18th day, Hinoe-Inu, clear: My father's colic struck severely again around the Hour of the Dog, so around the Hour of the Rat I summoned Tsunetake, and further requested prayer attendance from the five-head person Hitsukan. I also sent word to the court physician and Tsune-tomo, and they came one after another to administer medicine. However, by the Hour of the Tiger, he developed delirium and it became hopeless, reaching a critical state. Although bear bile and moxibustion treatments were also employed, they were ineffective. Despite his advanced age, his lingering attachment was infinite - grief beyond words. At this time, father the county governor was 82 years old, born on the 19th day of the 3rd month of Kan'en 2.

19th day, Hinoto-Mi, clear: At cockcrow, my father passed away. The scrolls of Kibune's Tagawara Hatakeosha-da and others were returned through Norikiyoshi to Naoko at the meeting place, stating that they were being returned due to Funtsu's critical illness. Next, copies of the temporary mourning notification documents for County Governor Funtsu's death day, along with those for Tsunekazu, Tsunenori, Tsunehiro, Tsune-tomo, Tsunetake, and Teikiyoshi were prepared (following precedent), and the same person carried and submitted them to Naoko (notably, when returning the correspondence tube, special care was requested). Next, the registrations for Funtsu, Tsune-tomo, Tsunetake, Tsuneyu, Teikiyoshi and others were communicated through the same person (sending the customary paper supplies). Next, notification to the family gate (letter) was submitted through Koyasu. Previously, notifications had already been sent to Teikiyoshi, Ujihiro, and Ujiso. Next, regarding funeral arrangements, after consultation among mother, Shinshi, Tsune-tomo, Tsunetake, and myself, the burial site was determined to be north of the late County Governor Tsuneoka's grave at Nakagawara, at the Hour of the Cock on this 19th day. Next, a special messenger was dispatched to Yasutoshi's place in Otsu (Namunosuke) carrying a letter, and for Onobu's place in Yamazaki, I requested that Tsunetake notify them. Next, I sent letters to notify Seo Jibei, the same Yahei, Seyaku-in, and Horikawa Omi-no-kami, and requested that the medicine office notify Ishimatsu, Tadamikumo Chusho, Taneda Shinano-no-kami, Tsuchiyama Shoso, Takahashi Wakasa-no-kami, and Omori Saburo-emon. At this time, family members, close associates, and neighbors immediately came one after another to offer condolences and helped with all arrangements. Furthermore, servants came one after another, preparing various implements, and necessary items for the mourning period (separately recorded) were sent to be purchased in Kyoto, with Magoichi as messenger. Next, regarding the ground blessing ceremony for the burial site, I requested Norikiyoshi to perform it, and the required ritual implements were...

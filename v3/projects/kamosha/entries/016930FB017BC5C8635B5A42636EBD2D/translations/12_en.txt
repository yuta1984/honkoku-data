4th day, kanoe-tora, clear. The household children's warrior doll festival proceeded as usual, though without the canopy. ○ This year, both the family elder and I are in light mourning, but this afternoon we placed mugwort and iris on the roof as customary. However, regarding this matter, the Mizusaki record from Jōhō 4 states that "mourning households place iris after fifty days." ○ In the evening around the hour of the dog, the four-year-old eldest son of Gō-ban-shū five-day palanquin bearer Third Left Jin-no-suke Taifu Yasuo died of smallpox. Consequently, Echizen-no-kami Ujikyō from the same group immediately took his place and joined Third Left as a substitute. However, since this was after the shrine purification, there was no need for the small and middle finger ceremony as per precedent.

The Imamiya Festival. ○ I performed proxy worship at Nison-in on behalf of the family gate and stopped by the Iseki residence to inquire after their well-being. ○ For the sixth seven-day memorial of the late County Head Tsunaoka, before the hour of the monkey, mother and Tsunate accompanied the grave visit.

22nd day, tsuchinoe-saru, clear. The final seven-day memorial for the late County Head Tsunaoka.

23rd day, tsuchi-no-to-tori, clear. Today marks the fiftieth day limit for the late County Head Tsunaoka, so Yasutoshi came up from Ōtsu for a grave visit and came to our gate.

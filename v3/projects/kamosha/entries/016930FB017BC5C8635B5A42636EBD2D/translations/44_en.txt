establish business relations with the local shrine community, so after consultation with council member Kyōshō, approval was granted. Today Ben'tō came to the shrine community to express his gratitude. It is said that this matter was handled as part of Lord Kyōshō's duties.

14th day, Kinoto-Hitsuji, clear. Since the domain's borrowed rice was to be delivered today, around the late Hour of the Dragon (8:30 AM), I took Kawase and others, purveyor Kosaburō, one colleague, two servants, and Kameya agent Shinbei to Nijō Granary. Meeting with agent Aoyama Gen'emon, I informed him that we had come because the rice was to be delivered today, and he said it would be delivered shortly. So we withdrew to the rest station at Masaemon's place to rest. Before long, the Kameya agent came to tell us that lots were now being drawn. I sent Kosaburō and his colleague, and after a short time they returned saying that it was generally Jōshū rice and 604 bales had been produced. At that location, one magistrate and two agents were present, with measures of 4 to 9 shō 6 gō 5 shaku. The prepared rice would be delivered shortly, at which time it would be exchanged for rice certificates. After another short while, someone came to call us, so I again sent Kosaburō with the inventory list received on the 6th. The certificate was then delivered, exchanged for rice certificates, and the receipt of a total of 300 koku of rice was completed.

However, of the 300 koku, 250 koku was rice for payment, and the successful bidder Wakamatsuya Heibei came forward. A contract document was immediately prepared and submitted. The remaining 50 koku was for the mansion and was transported directly home. For this portion, an accounting statement was prepared for Kameya agent Shinbei and immediately submitted. When I mentioned going to the granary magistrates' office to pay respects, I was told they had already left their office, so with Kameya's guidance, Kawase and I went respectively to the homes of the three magistrates and chief agent Aoyama Gen'emon to pay our respects, finishing around the late Hour of the Horse (1:30 PM) and returning to the mansion.

18th day, Tsuchi-no-to-I, clear. Since the borrowed rice matter was completed without incident, today Kawase Chikara delivered gifts as expressions of gratitude to the Nijō Granary magistrates and others.

19th day, Kanoe-Ne, clear. Since the domain's lecture certificates were completed for the first half of the year, today four Kyoto representatives - Katsu Mohei, Ogawa Ise, Takada Benji, and Jūichiya Jibei - were invited. After breakfast they came, and various matters were discussed at the accounting office. ○Due to drought recently, planting has been difficult. Already from after the Hour of the Horse today, Kyōsen took his turn at water duty, going out to Kotsuzuka. A substitute certainly performed the duty. ○After the Hour of the Sheep (2 PM), there was an evening shower with thunder and heavy rain. This was most welcome and the water duty was discontinued.

25th day, mizunoe-ne, clear. As the three attendant officials and three elderly ladies of Lady Teigan-in were soon to withdraw to Kyoto, today each was summoned to the household gate, granted audiences with both lords, and bestowed farewell gifts along with food and sake. The matter of the elderly ladies was handled through the inner quarters. ○Regarding the above, Keisen sent five decorated fans each as farewell gifts to the three attendant officials.

28th day, kinoto-u, clear. For visiting the ailing Tsunaoka-ō, today cousin Keimoto went to Ōtsu. ○Visited the residences of Lady Teigan-in's three attendant officials as they would soon depart.

30th day, hinoto-mi, clear. As Uncle's illness was not improving, Keisen went to Ōtsu from early morning. His condition was one of deep sleep and exhaustion. Returned home at the hour of the monkey. However, at Tsunaoka-ō's place, a grandson (male child) was born for the first time on the 27th. Remarkably, despite being ill, when the household inquired about the child's childhood name, he said it should be "Tsunawaka." Though the characters are unknown, surely he intends to use the character "Tsuna" from his own name.

Fourth month (small month)

1st day, tsuchinoe-uma, clear. For visiting the ailing Uncle, today cousin Keii went to Ōtsu.

2nd day, tsuchinotomi, clear. The family head served as substitute for shrine duty. ○Keii has not yet returned from Ōtsu. How concerning.

3rd day, kanoe-saru, clear. Around the half-hour of the dragon, urgent news arrived from Ōtsu. Uncle Tsunaoka-ō's illness could not be cured, and he passed away at the seventh hour of this morning, as reported by Keii. Consequently, Keisen transferred his role as alternate attendant for the Aoi Festival to Keshō, and also submitted his resignation from the three-group record-keeping position to the same Keshō, as they held equivalent positions. ○Due to Uncle Tsunaoka-ō's death from illness, to bring him to this place, after the hour of the sheep, Hozai, Keii and others accompanied the funeral procession. With palanquin bearers, tools, document boxes (written note: double-hanging), sandal bearers and other personnel numbering about fifteen people, they returned home. As previously discussed, they borrowed the retirement quarters of Keii's residence, so they carried him in through the alley and first placed him, still in the palanquin, in the south room. The accompanying attendants had been previously assigned to Kawakuma Hei's place, and guides were immediately sent there to arrange food and drink, after which they returned to Ōtsu. It was announced that Tsunaoka-ō had passed away immediately. He was seventy-two years old at that time. First, Tsunaoka, Hozai, Bunkyō, Keimoto, Keii, Keisen and others entered mourning. However, Itsukyō, whose daughter had died last month and was still in mourning, did not participate. Next, notification documents regarding the death date and the initial mourning dress of Hozai, Bunkyō and others were privately submitted to the meeting place. Since this month is the festival month, there will be no public announcement until after the festival. However,

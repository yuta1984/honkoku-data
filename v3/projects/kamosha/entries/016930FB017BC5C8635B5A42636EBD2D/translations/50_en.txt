My father attended the gathering but I did not participate. However, since our family's silver reserves have been depleted in recent years, the meal preparations and side dishes have been omitted from this year onwards.

19th day, Tsuchinoe-Inu, cloudy. Ume-no-Tōzaemon came regarding drought damage to rice fields, and I completed negotiations for a fifty percent tax reduction.

22nd day, Kanoto-Ushi, clear. My father was on duty, and Kyōsen attended court service as substitute. However, from this ninth month onwards, pottery offerings are omitted due to general austerity measures.

26th day, Kinoto-Hitsuji, clear. Today the Imperial House's Daigosho received transmission of a single character of waka poetry from Sentō Imperial Palace. At the Hour of the Dragon there was an imperial visit by palanquin. The ceremonial lunch box was received, with sixth-rank retainer Genmei accompanying, and everyone expressed reverence and received celebratory sake.

27th day, Hinoe-Uma, clear. For shrine duty, I requested Teisei to serve as substitute.

29th day, Tsuchinoe-Saru, clear. After the end of the mourning period for the Imperial House's Wakagosho, there was an imperial procession. At the Hour of the Snake in clear weather there was an imperial visit. The advance party consisted of three court nobles, guards, palace guards, four imperial guards, six menials, with the rest as usual. The return was at the Hour of the Horse. ○For the Imperial House retainer Irie Awa-no-kami, the wedding of physician Asō Dōsai's daughter from the Imperial Medicine Bureau was successfully completed last night without incident, so as celebration I sent two kin of fine sake, three bundles of Japanese paper, and katamata. Also for retainer Namba Iyo-no-kami, the wedding with the daughter of Tsuji Masachika, a rural samurai from Sakai in Izumi Province, was also completed successfully last night, so as celebration I sent three shō of sake, two bundles of Japanese paper, and tatebumi. However, these were sent under the joint names of father and son Bizen-no-kami of the same family name.

October, short month

1st day, Tsuchinoto-Tori, clear. This morning at the council hall, the annual lottery for family retainer duties was held as usual, and Kyōsen was appointed as storehouse administrator, so sacred sake was offered early in the morning as customary. However, due to this year's drought, austerity measures for the entire shrine community were announced from this ninth month of Tsuchinoe-Inu year through the eighth month of next Tsuchinoto-I year. Accordingly, there are reductions in the rice stipends for family retainer duties, following the precedent of the austerity measures from the previous Hitsuji year. This morning's lottery procedures and purification leaders, except for those with legitimate excuses, were announced without exception or discrimination, and those appointed this year will be exempted next year.

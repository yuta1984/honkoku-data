19th day, Kinoe-Uma, cloudy with occasional light rain - Regarding my mother's condition, a swelling appeared from before the 10th of this month, and from the 15th I consulted with Suruga-no-kami for examination and medicine. Though he said it was quite mild, I was still anxious, so today I went to Irako Chikara-no-suke's place to consult about the remaining matters. He said it might be something like a carbuncle according to rumors, and in any case, either father or son would come to visit soon. ○ There had been a preliminary agreement for the marriage between Seo Jirō's son Genkurō and the sister of Matsuo shrine priest family member Matsumuro Hyūga, and I had been asked to serve as go-between. Today the betrothal gifts were to be sent, so around the Hour of the Horse I went to the Seo residence, then went to Hyūga's lodging on the east side of Shimochōja-machi Muromachi to make the formal approach. Due to rumors from both families, I wore haori and hakama and brought one attendant. Though celebratory sake was to be served, due to cramped quarters this was declined, and after completing various greetings, I returned to the Seo residence. Around the Hour of the Sheep, I sent the betrothal gifts through the messenger Gihei - sake, food money, obi fabric, etc. At the same house we had one round of celebratory sake, and I returned home in the evening.

20th day, Hinoto-Hitsuji, cloudy then clear - Heavy rain fell after nightfall.

However, Shiaki had been released from duties due to his paternal aunt's death on the 7th of this month, but from today he resumes his duties. This is most fortunate. Regarding this matter, there was a sacred sake ceremony at Shiaki's, and I was invited to attend. As a congratulatory gesture, I sent one shō of sake.

7th day, yi-chou, clear. Participated in the completion ceremony for daily worship rotation duty at Kifune Shrine.
○During my absence, a letter arrived from Horikawa Ōmi-no-kami Hiroyoshi. The gist was that his son Hirofumi had run away from home last night, and he wished to consult directly about this matter, requesting me to come urgently. I went to his residence around the hour of the monkey.

8th day, bing-yin, clear. For the fifth meeting of the Kagura lecture, went to the council hall after lunch, conducted various matters as usual, and after completion everyone dispersed.

9th day, ding-mao, clear. Notice was given today by the adopted son Kurōdo that Nakano Tenzen, a retainer of the household gate, had died last night.

11th day, ji-si, clear. This was the western middle accounting assembly. Since I was to present the accounts, I arrived somewhat early for the presentation. The accounting and other matters proceeded as usual, with Keisen and Hissaken handling the calculations as requested. Afterward, it was reported that Shigetake was to be included among the ten rice-field appointees, but since the Kanshuji family was currently serving in the role of military court liaison, attendance was difficult, and therefore a written statement was submitted requesting withdrawal from receiving the stipend rice field. This matter was referred from the senior council to the three groups, as announced by the treasury magistrate. It was decided by discussion that regarding the participation of various ranks from the eastern group, a three-group assembly should be convened on another day for announcement, and a written statement should be prepared. However, this matter should originally have been submitted first to the three groups, but was submitted to the senior council and then referred by them to the three groups—the sequence was incorrect. Also, regarding the two sets of three cups, Mount Fuji paintings, and chrysanthemum paintings that were discussed at the gathering's opening on the 18th of last month, new ones were commissioned through Toyoaki's mediation and completed, to be used from today. Therefore, it was decided to send three shō of sake to Toyoaki as a courtesy.

13th day, xin-wei, clear. Light rain fell around the hour of the monkey. The fifth Kagura lecture meeting was held as usual at the Okudaya at Sanbongake. I departed before the hour of the snake and returned home at half past the hour of the cock. My father attended as substitute for Uncle. ○The New Year envoy from the household gate to the Kantō region, Senior Retainer Awa-no-kami, departed this dawn. Therefore, yesterday on the 12th, I sent two shō of sake as an accompanying gift.

15th day, gui-you, clear. This dawn, Horikawa Saemon-no-shī Hirofumi [went to] a Jōdo Shinshū temple in Nada Fukae Village in Settsu Province.

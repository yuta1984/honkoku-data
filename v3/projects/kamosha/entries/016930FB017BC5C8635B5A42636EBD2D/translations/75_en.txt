Regarding the relocation of adopted daughter Ume, I served as intermediary and handled all arrangements without delay. As a greeting, I sent omojūshi, one obi fabric, food money totaling 300 hiki, and as a celebration gift, one load from Ikura. In return, Keigorō and others were given gifts. Since our house has deep old obligations and this was not an external matter, I repeatedly declined, but since it was a celebration, everyone gladly accepted without reservation.

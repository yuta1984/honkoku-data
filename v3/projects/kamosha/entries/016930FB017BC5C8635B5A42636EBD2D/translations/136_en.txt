Both sides were in such condition. From there, returning through Yamanaka with source fog, the return route over Koseki Pass was extremely muddy and difficult. Night fell at Keage.

18th Day, Tsuchinoe-Saru, Clear - Made direct attendance for shrine duty rotation.

19th Day, Tsuchinotono-Tori, Cloudy - Brief extraordinary festival. Made shrine visit in the evening.

24th Day, Kinoe-Tora, Clear - From Nariki of the fifth group's junior officials, after reviewing the circulated notification ledger, signed below my name and transmitted it to Hitsukeken's office. The contents of said ledger are copied as follows:

Last August, the shrine liaison official summoned representatives, stating that reports had been received of inappropriate and unlawful individuals among Kamo shrine personnel who did not conduct themselves according to their official positions, and ordering that such matters be reported without concealment. Despite repeated attempts to decline this directive, it was not accepted. Recently, there were incidents of people striking young persons at Kamo shrine, and reports of fights at the sacred pond. Detailed written reports were demanded. Additionally, reports were received of specific individuals - Okamoto Takumi-no-Taiyu and Fujiki Maki-no-suke-Taiyu - and others traveling to other places without swords, all requiring investigation and written reports. Therefore, regarding matters known within the shrine community, such details should be reported, and for those matters specifically named but not understood, inquiries should be made and responses submitted. Regarding those traveling elsewhere without swords, since this was difficult to determine, this matter would be overlooked for now, but strict regulations should be enforced within the shrine community henceforth - this excuse was submitted. However, yesterday on the 7th, the liaison official summoned representatives and, with everyone present, issued the following directive on a separate document:

1. Regarding reports of misconduct within the shrine community that should be investigated, out of compassion this matter will not be pursued at this time. Henceforth, all members should maintain strict discipline and vigilance, with this directive to be communicated without omission to anyone.

The directive stated that this should be communicated without exception to all shrine priests and shrine families, and that a written acknowledgment should be submitted after everyone's understanding. This was conveyed from the shrine community to the three groups of senior, middle, and junior members. Although the shrine community had already requested four or five patrol members to prevent future misconduct, it was decided today by the three groups that additional strict cautions should be issued to prevent any misunderstandings.

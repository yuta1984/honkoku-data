came to apologize, and the rest was completed as usual. ○ Takahashi Wakasa-no-kami from the Imperial Kitchen Office came with his household, bringing in Sawamura Iyo-no-kami's son Osumi and others for a visit. A drink and rice gruel were served. His wife Somegawa visited for the first time.

5th day, Mizunoto-U, the auspicious Dragon Boat Festival: Heavy rain and strong winds all day. The sacred ceremonies and horse racing meet proceeded as usual. As the supervisor for the lower steps had been consulted in advance, at the third drumbeat I quickly donned summer court dress and hemp formal wear and headed to Kisaki-tei on the right side of the lower steps. However, on the left side of the lower steps were Supervisor Masayasu, Tsunetake, and Yasuyuki, while on the right side of the lower steps were Supervisor Kisaki, Tsunesue, and Tsunechika. Red rice and celebratory sake were served as usual. Soon I took my position for duty, and the proceedings followed previous years' precedent. However, in the third race the left side's voice-caller's timing was off so he withdrew for a restart. In the tenth race the left side lost. The remaining eight were draws, and needless to say there were no falls from horses. It concluded without delay at the late afternoon hour. Of course, Shizuori's imperial horse was changed to the main celebratory horse, etc. ○ As it was a ceremonial day, I attended the lord's gate early in the morning to offer felicitations, then immediately withdrew.

13th day, Kanotono-I, cloudy: When I reported for duty at the lord's gate at the usual hour, I was summoned by the senior retainers around the Horse hour. The administrators Okamoto and Sakamoto, myself, Okazaki, and others of both offices assembled and proceeded to the senior retainers' office, where Horikawa Omi-no-kami and Irie Awa-no-kami were both present and conveyed instructions in writing. The content was as follows:

Right Military Guards Lieutenant

While there should be those who receive strict orders regarding their official duties, out of His Lordship's compassion they are left in their current positions. Henceforth, regarding official matters, there shall be no individual discretionary handling, and all should consult with each other and serve with sincerity.

The above was conveyed, and furthermore it was stated that the written orders given to Namba Bizen-no-kami, Sasaki Dazai-no-daikan, Tachikawa Tonomo, and others should each be examined, as follows:

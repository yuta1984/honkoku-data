Due to the busy official duties of the shogun's household, I declined both positions.

5th day, Hinoto-Ushi, cloudy - The fifth meeting of the shogun's household lecture was held at Okudaya in Sanbon-machi. I went at the hour of the Horse and it concluded at the hour of the Dog. ○ For yesterday's (4th) shrine duty shift, I requested Teisei to serve as substitute.

7th day, Tsuchinoto-U, clear - Accounting for the shogun's household lecture.

8th day, Kanoe-Tatsu, clear - The shogun's palace single-temple construction meeting was held at Yoshidaya in Sanbon-machi. I went before the hour of the Horse and returned home after it concluded at the hour of the Rooster.

13th day, Kinoto-U, clear - For the 33rd memorial service of the late Gotokuseji-dono, Buddhist services are being conducted today and tomorrow at Tōfuku-ji Temple, and the Great Retired Shogun will attend both days.

14th day, Hinoe-Inu, clear - Today I accompanied the entourage to Tōfuku-ji Temple and paid respects at the mausoleum.
○ Tsuchiyama Suruga-no-kami had been ill since the 7th month, but I heard that his condition did not improve and he passed away. Therefore, I went to offer condolences to Tsuchiyama Kosaji and others, both for courtesy and private matters. Since it was during the period of ritual impurity, I made the inquiry from outside the gate. The public announcement will be made after the 50-day mourning period for the late Sanuki-no-kami concludes. Suruga-no-kami died shortly after Sanshū's death. The grief of the entire household is beyond words.

15th day, Hinoto-I, clear - Horikawa Ōmi-no-kami's son Saemon-shi had been ill since the year before last, and due to certain private misconduct, he resigned from office and returned his court rank certificate. In connection with this, there is a private agreement for adoption and succession involving the son of a Confucian physician residing in Kyoto named Shingū Ryōtei, who lives below Muromachi-Ebikawa, with a dowry of 400 gold pieces. Negotiations have been ongoing through the matchmaker Asai, and recently Ryōtei, as a representative of Ōmi-no-kami and his relatives, requested a direct meeting with us for discussions. Tonight at a tea house below Higashino-tōin-Ebikawa, we held our first private meeting and discussed various conditions. Awazu Inaba-no-kami and metalworker surnamed Asai, who are Shingū's relatives, were also present. Sake was served with various hospitality, and I returned home at half past the hour of the Rat.

18th day, Kanoe-Tora, light rain - For the shogun's household granary duties, I reported for service early in the morning. Rice totaling approximately 150 koku was delivered from various villages. All matters proceeded as usual, concluding at the hour of the Rooster, and I returned home at the hour of the Boar.

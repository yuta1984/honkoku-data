Five types of dishes; the formal meal consisted of one soup and three side dishes. Lord Sanii sent a box of delicacies as a souvenir (sea bream, ark shells, and fifty steamed buns, etc.), and departed around the hour of the Dog.

23rd day, Kinoto-I, clear: The Young Lord completed his mourning period today and attended court service, so there was a visit. ○ I visited Lord Fujinami to express gratitude for yesterday's visit.

24th day, Hinoe-Ne, rain then clear: The accounting for the seventh Kagura lecture took place after the hour of the Horse at the council chamber, and we assembled. Kohō was absent. All matters proceeded as usual and concluded at the hour of the Sheep. However, regarding the borrowed silver matter of the late Katsusei, there was a petition from his relatives, and various consultations took place on the 13th, but it was roughly decided that compassionate handling at this time would cause interference elsewhere, so the matter should be considered after the completion of the full lecture series. Therefore, Kesen conveyed this privately to Naoichi in advance. Subsequently, Naoichi stated that waiting until after the full lectures would make continuation too difficult, so he earnestly requested that the principal sum be returned immediately, the overdue interest of 96 monme be forgiven, and 2 ryō and 2 bu in additional funds be provided toward the principal, humbly requesting compassionate reconsideration. When this matter was discussed today, it was approved without objection. Therefore, the petition from last winter was returned, and the mortgage documents will be returned after the principal is fully repaid. The petition was returned through Kesen, and this decision was communicated.

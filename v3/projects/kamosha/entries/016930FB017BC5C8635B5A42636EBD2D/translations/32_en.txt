and was particularly requested to serve at the regular duty office. Especially since accounting officer Okazaki Taitō and assistant Dōsui are currently unavailable due to Taitō's illness and confinement, Kawase Shuzen has been working consecutive shifts for the past few days. Therefore, it was stated that I should begin duties at the current office immediately from tomorrow. This was also reported to chief retainer Yamaguchi Geki of the personal attendants that from tomorrow I would be stationed at the accounting office. After withdrawing in less than half an hour, I immediately made courtesy visits to the retainer household, bringing name cards. The copy is as follows:

"Having been appointed to concurrent service in the accounting department and granted one koku of rice as official stipend, I humbly consider this a most grateful fortune."

Respectful thanks,
Kondō Oribe

After completing this, I returned home in the evening. Though my father was on duty, I informed him in detail of today's unexpected appointment. In reality, this was an appointment as head of accounting - something unprecedented at the palace, bringing unlimited great joy to the entire household. It is truly precious. ○ The household's children and daughters celebrated the Doll Festival with celebratory sake as usual.

4th day, Kinoto-Tori, cloudy: I arranged for someone to substitute for my father's duty shift with Chokushi Jōkata. ○ At the noble house, this was my first day of full service at the accounting office. Naturally, when serving in full capacity, I appeared before His Lordship to inquire after his health, and notifications to various offices proceeded as before. Next, I received various instructions for office procedures and matters to be conveyed from colleague Kawase, after which Kawase departed. However, regarding the village headmen and elders in the domain, Kawase sent a circular notice announcing Kesen's appointment to full accounting officer, and similarly for the merchant households doing business with the domain - this was conveyed through the same person to contact chief Ogawa Ise, who then distributed it via circular notice.

5th day, Hinoe-Inu, clear: I departed from the palace around the hour of the Horse, and the remaining courtesy visits to distant members of the retainer household came today. ○ This was the fifth monthly meeting of the Three-Division Lecture Society in the third month. Although Kesen was originally involved, since this lecture group has about thirty members, he mostly did not attend after the initial meeting. However, this time warehouse magistrate Katoshi stated that having many people for these accounting discussions actually makes them less focused, so henceforth the Eastern Division would have Keiei, the Western-Central Division would have Kesen, and warehouse magistrate Ujihiko, etc.

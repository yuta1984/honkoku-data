When I conveyed this intent, the Head Priest replied that he would "accompany us." Hideaki also said, "As I have no preparation for formal shoes, I must by all means proceed ahead to serve." The Head Priest said, "According to recent precedent, we usually accompany together, so the shoes should be circulated."

Soon the Head Priest and others began their service, each donning formal shoes from the Head Priest's residence and proceeding together. At the board fence area of the entrance wall, they performed courtesy bows to the Riding Officers and proceeded to the Third Torii. The Head Priest and Deputy ascended from the western steps of the Palace Building, while the Deputy Administrator and Deputy ascended from the eastern steps. Accordingly, proceeding quietly, Kyōsen first removed his shoes at the bottom of the eastern steps and performed a bow, taking his seat when the Head Priest was seated ⟪marginal note: however, this was quite a late arrival⟫.

Prior to this, the supervisors Kyōi and Hitsaaki, who had been requested beforehand, wore hemp formal dress and undergarments and remained near the eastern steps area. Particularly, Hitsaaki was the deputy official for this year, namely at the right side steps area for the 5th day. From here onward, detailed records are kept in the Deputy Administrator's duty records, so I abbreviate here. However, when the Inspector brought the provisional inspector's document to the Palace Building, there was a discrepancy in the items, so I ordered that the provisional inspector's document we had provided should be retrieved, and informed the Head Priest of today's circumstances regarding the Inspector's document damage.

Soon when the inspector's document we had provided was retrieved, it remained damaged. Since this was a pressing matter, it was decided to conclude with the items originally received.

Deputy Administrator Lord Matsudaira Suō-no-kami's horse was his first for this year. The riding horse had thick purple trappings, the spare horse had thick crimson trappings, both being splendid in recent fashion. Moreover, during the hair arrangement ceremony, there was improper conduct in Riding Officer Kiaki of Miyagawa-shō's riding form, so the hair arrangement was lowered by one level.

All matters concluded as usual. At the time of departure, as initially, formal shoes were worn from the Palace Building, and at the eastern side of the Palace Building, each performed courtesy bows to the Head Priest. Since the Head Priest had no divine offering banquet according to recent precedent, the Deputy Administrator, Deputy, Assistant, Inspector, etc., each withdrew accordingly. At Naka-ōji, Kyōsen offered greetings to the Head Priest saying "Today the divine services concluded without incident, mutually auspicious," then parted, changed to straw sandals, and returned home. This was about half past the Hour of the Monkey (3:30 PM).

Immediately, I changed into next-level formal dress and went to pay respects to both supervisors' residences, greeting them that "matters concluded without incident, thank you for your efforts." Around the Hour of the Cock (6 PM), the Inspector arrived wearing hemp formal dress and apologized for the inconvenient circumstances and negligence regarding today's damaged provisional inspector's document. I told him to be mindful that such matters should not occur in the future, and he departed.

After nightfall, a servant came from the Head Priest saying "Today concluded without incident, mutually congratulations." Also, regarding today's departure, I believe that according to recent precedent, one should be accompanied to the gate, but today this did not occur. I would like to inquire thoroughly about the understanding of this matter.

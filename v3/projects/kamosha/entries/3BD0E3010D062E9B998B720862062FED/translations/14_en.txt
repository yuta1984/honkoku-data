What the shrine administrator and celebrant advance are each with arrows nocked to bows, and when the shrine servants report that waiting for the purification by the yin-yang master has ended, they shoot and discard the bow and arrows toward the purification. After that, there is sake presentation, and this ends.
Again entering through the torii, passing through the southern stairs of the narrow hall, they sit facing east on circular mats. The celebrant comes from the east and sits facing south. The sacred child sits slightly facing the shrine administrator, next to the celebrant.
The arrow-sword attendant comes and wraps and gathers rice, advancing the small box, first the edge of the small box. For rice: three bundles for the head priest's side, three bundles for the celebrant's side. The head priest's side first has the shrine administrator handle the small box; the celebrant's side first has the celebrant handle the small box. The sacred child's handling of the small box is the same as this. These rice grains are wrapped in paper by shrine servants, attached to sacred sakaki branches, and going down from the eastern stairs, they exit through the torii for the sacred procession. During this time, the shrine priests stand. The senior assistant official stands at the eastern end of the earthen section of the narrow hall.

A certain arrow-sword attendant comes and pours sake. Next, they announce the sacred meal. In those words they say: "We offer the sacred meal, offer the sacred meal, we humbly offer the sacred meal," and so forth. At that time the shrine administrator claps hands. They set up chopsticks.
Next comes the large table. There is sake presentation. Sake cups, the shrine priests separate. Setting up chopsticks ends and they withdraw. The shrine administrator goes to the sacred interior (sacred rice field?). In this sequence, the accompanying shrine priests and clan members wear purification robes. The celebrant also participates the same way. Residing in the sacred rice field, they present sacred paper streamers. These are set up on both sides. Next, taking the plow, they turn the soil. Next, they sow seeds. Only the shrine administrator sows seeds. Next, there is sake presentation. When the ceremonial dancing ends, they go to the celebrant's sacred rice field. First taking the plow and sowing seeds - only the celebrant. There is sake presentation. Sake cups, below the shrine administrator, taking the plow - the shrine administrator also does this.

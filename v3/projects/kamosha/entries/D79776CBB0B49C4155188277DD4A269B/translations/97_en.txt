Twenty-ninth day, Kanoto-tori (Metal Rooster), Clear weather
The imperial household has decided on great economies this time, and for the coming spring New Year celebrations, all items except for hishihanabira-kasane and similar items will be omitted. The meals will be offered in the inner quarters, and the samurai and above, as well as both role-holders, who previously received two koku of annual stipend rice each, will return this and receive only guard duty stipends. For the close attendants and below, one koku out of their usual two koku will be suspended. However, the御読初 (first reading ceremony) and 御書初 (first calligraphy ceremony) will proceed as in previous years, and the five delicacies, Horai decorations, etc., will be as usual.

The total expenditure for this season amounts to 1,826 momme and 8 bu in silver.

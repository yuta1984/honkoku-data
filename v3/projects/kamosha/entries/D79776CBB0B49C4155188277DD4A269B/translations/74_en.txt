Together with Middle Counselor Kuga's daughter and other ladies accompanying them, they proceeded to the right study hall, where the host Ryōtei came out to greet them at the Shōen gate entrance. After they were seated, tea and sweets were offered, and the same was served to the male and female attendants of both parties. At that place, the Confucian scholar from the capital, Maki Zensuke, lectured on the first year of Duke Yin from the Spring and Autumn Annals before His Lordship, and next the Confucian scholar from Izushi, Sakurai Ichirō, similarly lectured on the "Guan Ju" chapter from the Book of Songs. Afterwards, sake was offered, and one round of drinks was served to the attendants of both noble houses in the inner quarters during the day. After the hour of the monkey, they returned to the villa. I was scheduled to return before the hour of the boar. Today, Maki, through his introduction via Tsunechika, presented a seven-character regulated verse as follows:

15th year of Tenpō, Year of the Wood Dragon, 2nd month, 17th day
Lord Ichijō graciously honored the Shingū Seki at the Higashiyama study hall with the privilege of serving as lecturer, and composed this poem below to record his joy:

A place of string music and recitation among water and bamboo in three rooms
The ceremonial dress of ten thousand generations, the trusted advisors, who assists the surprising dream of the trouser-wearing minister, once helped
Since the Heavenly Grandson founded the country
This humble citizen Maki Yorii, in fear and trembling, bows twice

The Song Dynasty recluse Wei Ye wrote a poem thanking the minister for his visit, saying "Startled, I return from a glance at the immortal's dream, the scrolls call out that the minister has come." I respectfully record this for reference and inquiry.
Respectfully noted with reverence

Today Ryōtei gave as souvenirs one box of Imbe-yaki incense burner and one basket of steamed sweets, and in the evening gave each of the two Confucian scholars one portion of dried sweets.

23rd day, kanoe-saru, cloudy - Today there was a notice that due to the formal shrine relocation at Yamamori Shrine tomorrow evening, musical performances are prohibited from yesterday the 22nd through tomorrow the 24th.

24th day, kanoto-tori, clear - A prayer lecture was held again, with a stake of 1 ryō and 1 bu in the orthodox method, and Hitsukena's group joined with one card. Today was the first meeting, but I did not participate.

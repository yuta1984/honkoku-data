[Marginal note: Half-sheet] I have received and understood the official note. Now, since my uncle Okamoto Shimōtsuke-no-kami passed away this morning,
I shall observe the customary temporary three-day mourning and wear mourning dress for seven days. I hereby submit this notification. I humbly
request your favorable consideration. The above.

Later, an official letter arrived as follows:
We have heard that your uncle's illness could not be cured through treatment and he has passed away.
We think this must be a cause of great sorrow.
Therefore, condolences are extended to you. This is with great respect.

April 5th
To: Kondō Oribe-dono [Marginal note: He is the monthly duty officer] Irie Tosa-no-kami

Also, a folded letter arrived from the household retainers as follows:
We are sorry to hear that your uncle's illness could not be cured through treatment and he has passed away. We can only
imagine the extent of your grief. Therefore, we would like to call upon you to offer our condolences. The above.

April 5th, Yasuda Tōtōmi-no-kami
           To: Ijichi Hōzen
Kondō Oribe-sama

The name on the outer wrapper was the same. I replied that I would express my gratitude when I return to duty.

Tsunetake's sister's daughter-in-law is the adoptive mother of Mino-no-kami of the Yamazaki shrine family. The other day I sent word about Tsunetake's illness
not improving, but at that time Mino-no-kami was ill and serving as a substitute in shrine duties according to shrine law,
so until the 9th of this month he could not travel to distant places. Even if the illness
did not improve, his not coming to visit was considered improper, so after consulting with everyone, I sent word expressing our displeasure.
Tsunetake's funeral will be held tonight at the hour of tori (6 PM). Therefore, from evening I will change into mourning dress and attend the funeral

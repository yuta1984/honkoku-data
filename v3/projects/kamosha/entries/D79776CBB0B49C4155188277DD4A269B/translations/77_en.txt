There had been no communication whatsoever to uncle Tsunetō, myself, or others. However, since spring Tsunetake had fallen ill, and by this time he had not recovered, so the matter of whether it would be best to have adopted son Kiyosaki taken in was raised by Aki and others. Since it was decided he would be taken in on the 27th, two days ago, I visited Tsunetake to offer congratulations, but he has been particularly unwell for the past day or two. Tsunechika sent notification to Tsunetō, Hozai, and others. ○ Today at the hour of tatsu (8 AM), Tsuneaki received the oral imperial decree for Junior Fifth Rank Lower Grade at the residence of Hirohashi Kōmon-kyō, the court liaison for the shrine. This is most auspicious and precious.

April (long month)

2nd day, tsuchinoe-inu, rain - For the celebration of Tsunetake's adopted son Kiyosaki being taken in, I sent one cask of sake (three shō). Also, for Tsunetake's illness, I sent condolence gifts: two types of bleached cloth, powdered white sugar, one kyoku, etc.

4th day, kanoe-ne, overcast - Today physician Fukui Gōshū came to Tsunetake's residence for examination. While I was on duty for the imperial family, in the evening word came that Tsunetake's condition was extremely poor and tonight would be critical with an uncertain outcome. I requested to be excused and departed, stopping by Tsunetake's residence on the way home to observe his condition. His illness appears to be progressing. After a short while I returned home, but after the hour of ne (midnight) someone came to summon me, and when I went, Tsunetake was already in critical condition. This is infinitely regrettable. Aki, Takeaki and others assembled, and notification was sent to Tsunetō, Kiyoo, and others. First, regarding the family register: Tsunetake, Tsunetō, Tsunechika, Kiyosaki, etc. Tsunetake declined the shrine ritual duties, returned the tubes for Ikuta and Kifune fields to the junior officials, and the matters of Tsunetake's death date and the mourning dress notifications for Tsunetō, Tsunechika, and adopted son Kiyosaki will be submitted tomorrow. Takeaki will handle the arrangements. Tonight the notification rope at the gate was removed.

5th day, kanoto-ushi, clear - Regarding the matter of appointments and dismissals concerning Tsunechika's position in the administrative office, I consulted with Teikiyo. I also sent notification to him, as well as to Shigetake, Shigemasa, Shiaki, and others. Chinaki did likewise. Furthermore, I sent a messenger to Ōtsu Hozō from early morning. Chinaki went to physician Fukui and also to Abe and Yamai. For condolences, I sent one cask of sake (three shō) and three ryō in silver. From early morning I dispatched shrine priest Kameshirō. The mourning dress notification to the imperial family is as follows:

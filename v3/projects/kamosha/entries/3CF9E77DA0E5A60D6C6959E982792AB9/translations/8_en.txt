Counting the remaining flowers to be gazed upon, they are tears that scatter together with the blossoms
　　Composed on flowers when presenting one hundred poems during Emperor Sutoku's reign
　　　　　　　　　　　　Empress Dowager's Household Chief Shunzei

Mountain cherry blossoms—since they bloomed, people's hearts have grown weary of the sky, like white clouds on the peaks
　　When viewing flowers in a mountain village, someone asked if people don't pick souvenirs for home
　　　　　　　　　　　　Taira no Tadanori

Home souvenirs also don't know when to be picked, mountain cherries—since there has been no spring that returned without scattering
　　Composed on "geese returning in the evening sky"　Councilor Michichika

All birds have settled their roosts. Where do the returning geese head on their cloud path?
　　Composed on returning geese　　　Fujiwara no Takanobu

Gazing toward where the geese's voices sound, they are growing distant within the haze
　　　　　　　　　　　　Kamo no Shigenaka

　　　　　　　　　　　　Justice Minister Yorisuke

Hearts were not of the same group after all. Each returning with their own thoughts, the geese's voices
　　　　　　　　　　　　Palace Guard

Lord Hama says it combines "tsura" (face) with "tsura" (group/line). It cleverly applies the old saying "human hearts are like faces" to the geese

If you must go, see the flowers at their peak before returning. The same lodging of geese as when your heart first came
　　When various people composed on "geese returning in the rain" at Shigeyasu's house
　　　　　　　　　　　　Fujiwara no Yoshinari

The voices of geese that abandon even the flowers and return made all the more noise in the rain
　　Composed on returning geese for Lord Yorisuke's poetry contest　Empress Dowager's Household Chief Shunzei

Those who hear shed tears. The returning geese cry as they go in the dawn sky

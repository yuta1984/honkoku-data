　　　Kamo Shrine
　　　　Lantern Festival　Second Day of the Rat
On this day, they go to the sacred birthplace fields to gather lantern grass and small pines, offering these from the main shrine to the subsidiary shrines.

1. The reason this shrine uses the second Day of the Rat is that records show the first Day of the Rat is busy with divine ceremonies, so the second Day of the Rat has been used.

2. The origin of this public ceremony is the Day of the Rat excursion. In ancient times, people would go out to the fields on the Day of the Rat and pull pine trees. During the reigns of Emperor Suzaku, Emperor En'yū, and Emperor Sanjō, these imperial excursions likely took place as well. Particularly, Emperor En'yū's Day of the Rat ceremony was held on the thirteenth day of the second month of Kanna 1 (985), which was a Bosshi day {{Note: etc.}}

3. The Shūgaishō states: "What is ascending mountains on the Day of the Rat in the first month?" The tradition says: "Ascending mountains on the Day of the Rat in the first month, gazing far in four directions, obtaining the quiet energy of yin and yang is a technique for eliminating worldly troubles."

4. The characters for "lantern" are read as "miakari tomosu" in the Nihonki. Perhaps it was named lantern grass because it lights fires. Also, the Japanese name of this grass has been handed down as "tama-bōki" (jeweled broom).

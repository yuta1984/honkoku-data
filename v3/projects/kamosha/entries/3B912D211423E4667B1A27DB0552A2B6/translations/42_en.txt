Next, the shrine servants go toward the sacred stable and convey this message. Like the seven and a half times {{Note: many sacred rituals having already been announced before, they await the designated time}} Next, the white horse advances to the sacred courtyard
{{Note: this also takes Kataoka as the lead}} However, before this, before cockcrow, the stable administrator arrives at the sacred horse stable and rouses the grooms and other officials.
There is a ceremony of one offering at the outer waiting area.
　The procedure {{Note: according to the Seisoku Sacred Ritual Secret Notes}} First, one or two red-bordered tatami mats are laid out in the outer waiting area. The stable administrator takes the central seat
　{{Note: taking west as central}} facing east. Two clan members who lead the sacred horse position themselves north, ranked by west, facing south {{Note: each in purification robes and hakama pants, but regarding the administrator, though purification robes are recorded in the annual events, the master teacher also wears purification}}
　{{Note: robes with hakama pants worn between, which is appropriate; furthermore, the horse leaders are personnel from before and after the purification heads who serve in pairs each year, and most importantly, notification comes from the stable administrator three days in advance}} The inspector {{Note: in purification robes}} faces west from the east
　and sits on the long platform, while grooms and other officials below wait on the earthen floor {{Note: regarding the groom role, it is served by members of the shrine servants (or head priest) group; first pine needles are spread in all four directions of the earthen floor, and long platforms are set up on top, but a continuous three-section long platform is laid from in front of the administrator to the earthen floor}}
　{{Note: each positioned north-up facing east: first the master teacher, then two shrine servants from the head priest's group, but regarding the group members, due to the narrow space they sit facing west from the east; besides the two shrine servants serving with torches, two or three shrine servants who come for notification wait in the east; after congratulations, there are seven shrine servants in total}}
　Next comes the offering ceremony. First, the initial offering is presented. Three sake cups {{Note: three earthenware vessels}} are placed on offering tables, along with three pieces of dried abalone, three pieces of kelp, and pounded chestnuts

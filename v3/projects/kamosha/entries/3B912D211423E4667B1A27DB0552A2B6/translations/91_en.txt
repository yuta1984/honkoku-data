At the great floor, the visiting shrine officials also divide left and right as before, waiting above and below the stairs. Next, the sacred curtains are rolled up. Next, the negi side presents the sacred broom and sacred cloths (of two straw brooms, one at the handle portion, wrapped entirely in sacred cloth and placed on a small round seat and circular tray). Next, from the hafuri side as well (same as before) (both sides announce "sacred procession ahead"). Next, two sacred offering stands are brought out from the inner sanctuary (all the left and right ceremonial objects that had been stored are brought out and loaded. First the negi side, then the hafuri side. They are passed along in order so there is no confusion between left and right, and the negi side handles the sacred taboo river water in front of the sacred offering shelf, which the deputy administrator washes and purifies). Next, the negi side presents sacred paper candles (the chief negi holds them to illuminate the inner sanctuary). The deputy master presents them. Next, in the inner sanctuary (the sequence is recorded separately), the sacred cleaning is completed and the paper candles are removed. Next, the sacred broom and cloths are brought from the inner sanctuary to the outer sanctuary, the chief and deputy negi take them and sweep and wipe the inside and outside of the sacred doors, the great floor, etc., then remove them in sequence. Up to the Ōta negi and Shinmiya hafuri, they complete the sacred cleaning, sweeping, and cleaning of the high railings, then place them narrowly between the high railings. Next, the negi side presents the sacred offering stands (first negi side, then hafuri side). Next, the hafuri side proceeds to present summer garments. In this ceremony, the vestment keeper manipulates them at the Wakamiya worship hall. First, he takes the lid of the white wooden sacred bitter chest, the sacred lined robe (white silk with two-leaf hollyhock pattern, lined with habutae), sacred layered garments (sacred hem-continued gauze) (crimson with two-leaf hollyhock distant pattern), sacred braided belt (white), next the sacred court robe (gauze with golden dye and hollyhock arabesque pattern), sacred unlined robe (crimson silk with horizontal diamond pattern), sacred red hakama (crimson refined silk), next

the sacred cypress fan (white wood with two-leaf hollyhock pattern, pivot with butterfly and bird design), sacred court dress (white gauze with hollyhock arabesque pattern), sacred outer hakama (ironed ground with hollyhock and bitter grass circle pattern, lined with crimson beaten habutae), etc., are placed on the lid and presented (three or four times). Next, winter sacred garments are brought from the inner sanctuary (white silk with brocade ground pattern, etc., same as the lined robe), placed on the lid and removed, the vestment keeper receives them, stores them in the bitter chest, and transports them to the feast hall. Next, the sacred curtains are lowered. Next, the clan deity hafuri, shrine deputy, etc., rise in sequence, advance to the bottom of the stairs, stand in line, bow once, and return to their seats. Next, the sacred key is given in advance to the five-shrine hafuri (however, the Kifune officials take their usual positions on the hafuri side, and after completing the main shrine norito, they withdraw from before the deity and take a respite for the great circuit at the shrine precincts. The Ōta clan deity officials descend to the sacred birth place, and after completing the presentation of hollyhock to the main shrine, they participate. Therefore, they accompany the sacred cleaning and hollyhock presentation). Next, the seven-shrine officials rise (however, taking the Kataoka officials first is as usual. After the Kataoka negi descends the stairs and bows once, he proceeds directly through the Chinese gate to Kataoka without returning to his seat. The officials of Ōta clan deities and others complete the great circuit and take respite at the shrine precincts). They proceed to various shrines (Kataoka, Shinmiya, Wakamiya, Nara, Sawada, etc. Along the route, they make pilgrimage to each shrine). They perform sacred cleaning.

The ceremony involves first having both officials and attendants take seats at the worship hall. Next, the hafuri rises (without seated or shoe bowing) and advances to the earthen area for one bow, ascends to the great floor for one bow, and opens the sacred doors (everyone moves from their seats and prostrates). Next, the negi rises (seated bowing and shoe bowing as usual) and advances to the earthen area, the hafuri descends the stairs to stand alongside for one bow, they ascend to the great floor for one bow and enter the inner sanctuary for one bow. Next, the attendants advance and

Next, the deputy administrator proceeds to the falling veranda and announces the completion of the Kataoka earth ritual {{Note: The ceremony is as usual}} Next, the assistant head priest recites prayers {{Note: Together with the main temporary shrine}} After completion, hand clapping {{Note: The assembly responds}} At this time, after the completion of the main shrine prayers, the deputy shrine administrator proceeds to the small shrines to offer small pines and lantern grass.

The ceremony involves the following locations: Sugio Shrine, Tanao Shrine, Hashio Shrine, Yamao Shrine, Fujio Shrine, Kawao Shrine, Suwa Shrine, Hashimoto Shrine, Iwamoto Shrine, Kajita Shrine, Shirahige Shrine, Hyakudayū Shrine, Chinjū Shrine, and Fukutoku Shrine - fourteen shrines in total. After completely offering at all, they withdraw. However, the lantern grass remains placed on the great platform.

Next, the assistant head priest proceeds to the great platform, takes the lantern grass and places it on the left and right sides of the sacred doors {{Note: Both two bundles (or perhaps three bundles)}} He places the imperial table in its original location, performs one bow, descends the stairs and withdraws. After completing the great circuit pilgrimage, they proceed downward. Next, they offer in the outer sanctuary as the evening divine meal. The ceremony is as usual. After the rituals are completed, at the direct meeting (perhaps missing the character "者") it is the same as the morning divine meal {{Note: However, when today's assigned shrine officials and priests serve, they work in court dress and caps, and for the lantern festival ceremony there is no need to wear purification robes. However, this is the priest of Ōta clan deity}} {{Note: Even so, first the lantern festival ceremony at a certain shrine is completed, then they return to the main shrine to offer the evening imperial meal}}

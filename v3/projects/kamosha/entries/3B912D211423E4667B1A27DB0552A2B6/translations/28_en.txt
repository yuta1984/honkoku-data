Finely cut daikon radish is placed in the top piece of two stacked small earthenware vessels, and a small amount of fins is placed in the top piece of five stacked small earthenware vessels. In total, there are ten vessels. Since the ya-tone prepare and advance these, shrine servants carry them on boards and distribute them individually. However, passing to the rear seats throughout the year occurs only three times per year. Among these, on New Year's Day and the 14th, the ya-tone prepare and advance them. At this time, only the twenty-one shrine officials and head persons distribute them. The 7th is under the direction of the administrator. Therefore, besides the shrine officials, (purification?) head persons, and even those who visit at will each enter the triple [ceremony] and participate. Particularly outside of the right seating, five clan members on duty, deputy administrators, meal officials, etc., each receive one bowl, while yin-yang representatives who do not take seats do not participate. Twenty-one tone officials, three shrine servants [Note: including two ya-tone on rotation], two small deputy pine ceremony officials from the imperial food office each receive one bowl, three bowls for firewood workers, etc., are provided by the administrator. In total, about one hundred preparations [Note: and so forth].

Next, one cup of toso [Note: triple earthenware] is distributed individually [Note: this is the role of the tone officials]. Next, the tone officials bring trays to the end seats and announce the sacred chopsticks [Note: however, at this time they lower one foot to the board gap space when announcing]. At this time, each performs direct courtesy, then the inner sanctuary deity offerings are distributed.

For the head priest: one carp, one bird, one sea bream, eight rays, etc., are placed in sacred chests and shrine servants carry them directly from the offering hall to his residence. Therefore, they do not pass through the seats. First, for the senior celebrant: one carp, one bird, one sea bream, eight rays, etc., are distributed at the tone officials' seats. Next, from the senior negi to the Kataoka negi, two sea bream and eight rays each are distributed. From the Kataoka negi to the clan deity celebrant of certain shrines, for the deity offering two-portion direct meetings, the senior celebrant and below each have [offerings] placed in sacred chests and the tone officials distribute them. The tooth-hardening offerings are two portions for the red officials, but they do not pass through the seats; the tone officials deliver them directly to the shrine officials' summoned attendants.

Next, toso [Note: placed in sake servers, tone officials take and pour, with attendants added at the end seats], then sacred vegetables from the morning offerings are placed on round (square?) trays and distributed to left and right. The negi small equipment on the right consists of items from the outer sanctuary negi faction morning offerings - high arrangements, sacred grilled items, etc., are excluded and passed from the imperial food office to the tone officials, so everything is distributed. The items are three-cut items, somen noodles, dumplings, shaped rice cakes, pheasant from sacred soup, sashimi, vinegared fish, flat cuts, wood splits, torn items, etc. Salt wine, tide-boiled items, vinegar, cold soup, etc., are removed by meal officials at the imperial food office. However, for other sacred ceremonies, the sacred soup is excluded.

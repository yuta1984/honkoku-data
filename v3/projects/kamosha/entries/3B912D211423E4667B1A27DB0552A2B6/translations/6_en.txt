During important ceremonies, when it comes to the head priest's turn, they change and put on their upper garments《Note: etc.》

Next, the divine offerings depart from the offering hall. First, this involves offering rice to Nara Shrine, Udono Shrine, and others.

The ceremony first involves cooking sacred rice at the sake hall《Note: This is the duty of the head cook. The aforementioned rice is called "three-pestle rice," and for both inner and outer sanctuaries at the sake hall, the yatone and komokudai take turns every fifteen days to pound it. The upper fifteen days are handled by the yatone, the lower fifteen days by the komokudai》.

When completed, it is first placed in a handled measuring cup. One of the two people, yatone or komokudai《Note: When it's the yatone's turn, they wear yellow robes underneath; when it's the komokudai's turn, they follow the etiquette of the left way》 proceeds to Nara Shrine and offers it while standing outside the viewing gate《Note: However, this ceremony later involves offering before the deity, and the withdrawal of offerings becomes a direct meal for the kitchen staff》.

Next, the portion for Udono is placed in a sacred chest《Note: With sacred silk cover. After removal from Nara Shrine, it is again placed in the handled measuring cup and transferred to the sacred chest at the central depression. Pine needles are spread inside the sacred chest. However, it is piled in smaller amounts than the portion for Nara Shrine》. The firewood carrier《Note: wearing upper and lower garments》 transports it to the head priest's pavilion, where the divine teacher《Note: wearing court cap, large unlined robe, and pure white undergarment》 offers it while it remains in the sacred chest.

After withdrawal, the divine teacher holds a direct meal. Furthermore, after the main shrine's outer sanctuary divine offerings depart, one portion of cedar-shaped rice is placed directly in the handled measuring cup, and the firewood carrier brings it to the sutra recitation place, hands it to the offering monks, and prepares it for Fugen《Note: etc.》. Additionally, seven portions called "seven御料 round rice" are collected by the head priest's associates who come to the sake hall. In addition to the above,

two people called guard swordsmen《Note: However, one of them is for consultation, and is part of the rotating duty among the upper twenty-one people》. The above is the standard practice for every religious ceremony and daily offerings.

Before the divine offerings depart, a shrine attendant carrying sakaki branches goes first, announcing the sacred advance《Note: The shrine attendant wears yellow robes. The locations for the sacred advance are: between the third torii and stone bridge, next below the sakaki, next when entering the second torii, next below the jeweled bridge, when entering the middle gate - these five locations in total》.

Next comes the sake flask《Note: Carried respectfully by the tone. It has a sacred silk cover. Normally, before ceremonies at the deputy's pavilion, the junior deputy brings it from the deputy's pavilion to the shrine grounds. The ritualist's portion is normally kept at the offering hall, and now the junior deputy is made to send it to the offering hall》.

Next the sacred advance《Note: same as before》, next one sacred chest for the ritualist's portion《Note: Carried respectfully by the tone. Among the total forty-two tone, the upper twenty-one participate in every ceremony without fail, while the remaining twenty-one are divided into thirds with seven people each taking rotating duty》.

Next, similarly one portion《Note: This is the ritualist's shiiba rice cake. Carried respectfully by shrine attendants》. The superintendent and administrative officers follow, then come the outer sanctuary divine offerings《Note: Kitchen staff follow《Note: in pure white robes》. This is the morning offering portion. Placed in lacquered vermillion containers》.

《Note: The ceremonial chest has a sacred silk cover. Portions for Kataoka, Shingu, Wakamiya, and Sangū are placed in sacred chests, loaded onto the ceremonial chest, with two carriers and shrine attendants from the lower two rotating duty personnel》《Note: Each shrine official【written in vermillion】 perhaps respectfully bows【written in vermillion】》. When the divine offerings pass through the earth building, each shrine official moves from their seat and prostrates themselves. At that time, the yin-yang master holds nine hemp stalks and stands below the jeweled bridge to perform purification of the divine offerings《Note: However, the divine offerings called the chief liturgist's portion and the small shrine portions cross the jeweled bridge》.

《Note: They enter the tower gate, middle gate, etc., and arrive at the western offering place. The ritualist's portion goes through the connecting hall and enters the new shrine gate, Chinese gate, etc., arriving at the eastern offering place. The daily offering ceremonial chest goes from the sun gate to the western offering place》. Next, starting with the head priest, they rise in order《Note: First a seated bow, then a shoe-removing bow. However, the chief liturgist crosses the chief liturgist's bridge, and the ritualist crosses the ritualist's bridge to proceed before the deity》. One bow at Hashimoto Shrine, then the yin-yang master purifies the shrine officials.

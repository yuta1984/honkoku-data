Horeki 6th year, 9th month, 9th day《Kifune-hafuri deputy》
Junior Fifth Rank Lower, Kamo no Agata-nushi Yasumasa

The deputy ritualist performs the reading《However, regarding the ceremony of unrolling and rolling up, lowering to the right side and unrolling and rolling is the same as the shrine maiden's procedure》After finishing, he inserts it into the fine hall《east side》performs one bow and《turning right》descends putting on footwear《footwear bow》
As initially, he passes through the center《standing sand》and returns to stand at the east enclosure north head. The advance and retreat procedures are the same as the shrine maiden's method below《but there is only a left-right distinction》The matter concludes.
Both officials《facing east and west》face each other then withdraw《at the enclosure head, hanging the hem》and return to the earthen building《the route is as initially. The ancient ritual procedures state that together with the deputy shrine maiden and ritualist there is sumo ground division, with the east being the shrine maiden's side》
《The west is the ritualist's side. There is ground division starting from the east then the west. When that ceremony ends, again the sumo wrestlers line up and approach from the east, then the west does the same. However, at that time the ritual baton is placed at the waist, the sumo match roster is read, and passing by the west side of the standing sand it is placed beside the imperial blind, then holding the baton he returns to the original path. From there bird dancing, then sumo》
《When the sumo concludes they arrive at the earthen building. The daily imperial offering high-piling and sake cups, when that ceremony ends they proceed down to Sawada Shrine and take seats in the office building where there are procedures for ritual offerings, etc. In the clan records it says that using the ritual baton to process walking to completion is the duty of the Kifune dual officials. In recent times for over three hundred years》
《Since there is no position, this has not yet been performed. Since these dual officials exist from time to time, perhaps they perform the duty. When there are only five official positions, the deputy shrine maiden and ritualist become lower-seated so they stand to perform their duties. This is because there is no ceremony where lower-ranking people sit while higher positions should stand to perform together. Therefore when there are twenty-one positions, the Sawada shrine maiden and ritualist should become the ones to perform》
《this duty. This is because the clan deity dual officials are in the interval between shrine visitation and not yet returning, etc. Also the deputy's annual records are the same as this, saying it is done concurrently, but how is it that the deputy dual officials still perform this now? This should still be inquired about further》

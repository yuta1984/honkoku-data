Moreover, both Kifune officials withdraw from the divine presence after the main shrine's prayer words are completed, finish the small circuit, and still remain at the shrine grounds. Kifune visits the next day).

Next, the five officials take their seats for prayer words (the order is as usual). During this time, the deputy extinguishes the torch. Next, the administrator master goes to the outer veranda and announces that the earth festival

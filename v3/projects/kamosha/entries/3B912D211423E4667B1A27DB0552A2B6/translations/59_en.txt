Day of the Rat　　　　　　Nakazane
　Jeweled broom trees, plucked at spring's first sound, the grass fence made of jeweled cords

　The commentary states: The jeweled broom is made from grass called "lantern grass" to tie brooms, and is used to begin sweeping silkworms on the first Day of the Rat in the first month.

　On this first Day of the Rat in early spring, the jeweled broom trembles like jeweled cords when taken in hand

　The matter of jeweled brooms is recorded in detail in Kiyosuke's Fukurogoshi, as I recall. This should be further investigated.

　　　Lantern Festival　First Month, Second Day of the Rat, Hour of the Horse
First, two days beforehand {{Note: or the day before}}, the treasurer brings small pines, lantern grass, etc. to the shrine officials' residence. Twenty-one shrine officials each receive one bundle wrapped in sugihara paper {{Note: The bundle shapes have left and right distinctions, tied with mizuhiki cord and tagged. The treasurer retrieves them before the day's shrine visit guidance. However, the head priest handles fourteen subsidiary shrine portions}}
{{Note: Regarding shrine portions, Mori Renkyu's record mentions sixteen shrine portions - what of this? They are wrapped in half-sheets, not requiring tags. On the day, they are managed by the deputy administrator at the West Offering Hall}} When the day arrives {{Note: the second Day of the Rat. According to the Uji theory, this divine ceremony should be a Day of the Rat banquet, being the first Day of the Rat}}
{{Note: However, at this shrine they use the second Day of the Rat. According to Onkosai's explanation of this discrepancy, perhaps the second Day of the Rat has been used due to the abundance of divine ceremonies}} They make offerings at the outer sanctuary, with the duty shrine official preparing the morning sacred meal {{Note: as usual}} When finished {{Note: When there are two imperial offerings, how is this handled? Are both morning imperial offerings presented?}} Next comes the guidance, and the assistant head priest and below {{Note: the Kifune priest does not attend}} deputy shrine administrators {{Note: each wearing pure robes and ceremonial dress, appointing one attendant each}} chief administrator, deputy, officials {{Note: each in pure robes and ceremonial dress}}, purification leaders, chief administrator officials, etc. exit the west gate and proceed to the sacred hall {{Note: The lantern grass is placed in imperial chests, carried respectfully by the treasurer}} Each stands alongside {{Note: Do they enter facing north with east precedence, or facing east with north precedence? According to Kei, perhaps facing west with north precedence}} Next, the assistant head priest and deputy shrine administrators {{Note: According to Onkosai and Chōō, they speak of the northeast direction, perhaps facing the northwest direction. There is indeed a lantern mound}} rise and perform two bows. At this time, the chief administrator and officials present the lantern grass {{Note: placed in imperial chests}}
{{Note: Two chests - one imperial chest for the main shrine portion, one imperial chest for the subsidiary and branch shrine portions}} The assistant head priest and deputy shrine administrators take these and arrange them on the grass, reciting ritual prayers {{Note: Renkyu's Secret Record calls this the Second Day of the Rat Festival}}

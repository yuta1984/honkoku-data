Foundation Day of Public Affairs《6th month, 30th day》Great Purification
　The Great Purification means that all court officials gather at Suzaku Gate to perform purification. It occurs twice, in the sixth and twelfth months, beginning from the time of Emperor Tenmu. Ritual purification also occurs at times of defilement, and when conducting divine ceremonies there are also temporary occasions, but this Great Purification involves all court officials gathering together to perform purification. Also, today there is the custom of families passing through rings.
　　"Those who perform the purification of Minazuki's name-crossing are said to extend their lives for a thousand years"

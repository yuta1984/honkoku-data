The ceremony proceeds as follows: The chief priest (kamunushi) and hafuri advance from the tower gate via the jewel bridge and the negi quarters' bamboo bridge, etc., and line up at the carriage approach (kurumayose) of the bridge hall (chief priest on the west, hafuri on the east). At this time, the bettō (administrator) and shoshi (secretary) advance together to lower the hems of the chief priest and hafuri's robes. The bettō takes the chief priest's hem, and the shoshi takes the hafuri's hem, passing through the bridge hall (each still wearing their shoes) and descending to the north stairs, proceeding over the jewel bridge, turning back, and standing in formation facing southeast (the chief priest at the south riverside below, the hafuri at the north riverside above). Next, they hang the cotton tebukuro (hand coverings), and (as observed on April 18th, Hōreki 8th year, it seems questionable that there is no direct-facing ceremony) with mibitai, the bettō and shoshi perform their roles, then return to the bridge hall. The route taken is: the chief priest crosses via the west side bridge, the hafuri via the east side bridge, ascending from the carriage approach to the bridge hall, standing facing north at the third pillar passage (throughout, the bettō and shoshi hold their hems) (since the shoshi dayu keeps the ritual words in his breast, they are passed from the shoshi dayu to the bettō dayu). Next, the bettō dayu passes the celebratory words to the chief priest. Then the chief priest and hafuri advance to the second pillar passage, stand in formation, and read the norito prayers. First, the chief priest removes the ritual paper wrapping, etc., holds it up in the center and reads it. After completion, he rolls it up as before and passes it to the bettō, who passes it to the shoshi, who passes it to the hafuri, who reads it. The ceremony is the same as for the chief priest, and after completion, it is returned to the shoshi dayu. Next, they descend to the north side of the bridge hall and return to stand at the jewel bridge (at this time standing in formation facing north). Next, they cut and untie the hand coverings and throw them into the water below the bridge. The chief priest's hand covering is cut by the bettō and thrown upstream from the bridge, while the hafuri's hand covering is cut by the shoshi and thrown downstream below the bridge. Next, they proceed via the original route to the carriage approach and hang up their hems. At this time, the chief priest and hafuri each pass through the west side bridge to reach the carriage approach. After completion, they pass from under the north eaves of the hosodono through the camphor bridge, tower gate middle gate, etc., and wait at the shrine precincts.

Next, the chief priest and others arrive at Wakamiya shrine, where the hafuri divide left and right, advance before the deity, perform one bow and take their seats (as before, but the shrine officials of Kifune, Ōta, Nara, Sawada clan deities, etc. do not participate). At this time, the gon-negi advances directly from the Chinese gate, performs one bow at the bottom of the stairs, and ascends to the great platform. Next, the gon-hafuri performs one bow at the bottom of the stairs and ascends. Next, the gon-negi removes the sacred offerings, the gon-hafuri takes them and passes them to the tenkū, who takes them and places them on the negi quarters' sacred offering shelf. The gon-hafuri performs one bow at the bottom of the stairs and returns to his seat. The gon-negi places the sacred offering table in its original location, performs one bow, descends the stairs, performs one bow, and returns to his seat. Next, the chief hafuri rises from his seat and ascends to the great platform (advancing, retreating, bowing, and ceremonial saluting as before) (however, when evening approaches, the deputy dayu advances to the small courtyard and holds a torch (participating in court dress, hitoe, sashinuki, and folded eboshi cap)). The sacred doors are opened (moving from seat, prostrating). Next, the chief priest advances to the bottom of the stairs, the hafuri descends the stairs and they stand together, perform one bow above and below, and enter the inner sanctuary. Next, starting with the chief negi, they rise from their seats in order and advance to the stairs.

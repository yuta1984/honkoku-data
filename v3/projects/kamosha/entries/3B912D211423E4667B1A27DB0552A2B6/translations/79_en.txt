First day of the fourth month
From the previous night, the shrine officials <<twenty-one people>> each begin the divine purification for the Aoi Festival, so on the previous day the Yin-Yang Master erects purification bamboo (imidake) within the gates of their residences <<the prayer master erects it to the left of the gate, the ritualist erects it to the right of the gate. However, since purification is exclusively an external matter, it follows the left and right as seen from outside>>. From today, monks, nuns, and people in mourning dress are prohibited, and the sounds of military games and revelry are stopped.

For this ceremony, the Yin-Yang Master <<wearing court cap, large court robe, and purification garments underneath>> brings along one attendant <<wearing hakama>> and comes to the shrine official's residence <<not necessarily following rank order, but according to the route>>. The implements for purification are prepared. First, five sheets of ceremonial paper (sugihara) are cut for the four directions <<however, no special header paper is used, cutting with the same paper>>.

Five small offering wands (heigushi) are cut to about one shaku two sun in length, with one sheet of offering paper inserted into each rod <<however, the header paper portion extends about one sun forward>>. These are erected in straw bundles <<the straw bundles are wrapped with paper and bound with straw>>. Green bamboo serves as purification stakes (imigushi) <<one jō eight shaku long, bamboo of four to five sun diameter>>. Five grains are buried beneath it <<the varieties are rice, millet, barnyard grass, wheat, and beans, but nowadays it is often simplified to use rice bran. However, households of horse racing participants use the five grains, and their method differs slightly. Details are in the section on horse racing ceremonies below>>. This is the abbreviated ceremony of purification. Two earthenware vessels are used three times, filled with a little water, and one or two sakaki leaves are cut and placed in them. They are placed face down (utsufuse) beneath the purification stakes, above the rice bran.

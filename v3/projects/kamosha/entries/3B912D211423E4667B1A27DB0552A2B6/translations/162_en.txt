Next, the negi and hafuri of the Seven Shrines, along with the rotating offerers (one person from the Wakamiya and Kataoka shrine duty attendants is appointed; for the rest, as in every sacred ceremony, one purification leader is appointed to serve as customary) follow together and proceed to a certain shrine (in this sequence, shrine officials and clan members at the sacred registry building insert sacred sakaki and day-shade grass into their caps and court caps when proceeding. Previously, arrow-blade negi were placed on trays and prepared at the sacred registry building, and those making voluntary pilgrimages also insert these into their hair).

For the head priest's direct meeting, the chief administrator has the sword-bearer sent to the head priest's pavilion) are offered (this is an offering for one session of extraordinary festivals). Besides this, outer sanctuary daily offerings are as usual (both inner and outer are placed in sacred chests). Later, scenic objects are stored in the inner sanctuary (there are specific secret teachings; for those who have not yet received transmission, it may be acceptable to store them in boxes for scenic objects).

Next, the assistant hafuri exits the inner sanctuary, bows once above and below the stairs, and waits (beside the western stairs). Next, the negi exits the inner sanctuary, bows once, and prepares the left and right sacred table trays on the great platform.

After completion, both assistant officials advance to the assistant shrine (first negi, then hafuri). At this time, the deputy holds the pine torch as initially, and rotating offerers rise. Next, outer sanctuary sacred offerings are removed. The procedure is as at the main shrine. After everything is completely removed, rotating offerers return to their seats. Next, the assistant hafuri advances below the stairs, bows once, and waits (beside the western stairs). Next, the assistant negi returns to his seat. Next, the assistant hafuri ascends the great platform and temporarily closes the sacred doors (not yet fastening the sacred locks). At this time, everyone prostrates. Next, the deputy advances to stand in the small courtyard and holds the pine torch as initially. Next, the assistant negi advances to the main shrine (waits on the great platform). Next, the assistant hafuri advances to the main shrine earthen platform (however, after the assistant shrine sacred doors are temporarily closed, after bowing once above and below the stairs, he directly advances to the main shrine earthen platform). He bows once. At this time, the rotating offerers advance to the customary place. Next, outer sanctuary sacred offerings are removed (as usual). After everything is completely removed, rotating offerers return to their seats. Both assistant officials wait at the hafuri side (crossing hall).

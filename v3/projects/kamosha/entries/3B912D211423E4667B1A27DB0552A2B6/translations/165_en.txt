On the 19th day of the 11th month of Tenpō 3 (1832), year of the Dragon, a special festival was ordered to be conducted by the Imperial Court, and at that time the shrine officials assembled at the office building.
After gathering together, each performed hand purification. Each person's attendants served in this capacity, and for the chief hafuri, the officials served in this capacity.
Regarding the removal of the lid of the ritual chest in the courtyard, this is taken after shrine officials wait above and below the stairs. At the assistant hall, it is also taken after waiting above and below the assistant hall stairs.
The three-sun measurement for the assistant hall should be struck within the third pillar of the west corridor - this should be understood.

Small Festival (ceremony to collect this year's new grain; today daily offerings are presented at the noon hour; duty shrine officials conduct sacred meals as usual)
The time limit reaches around the hour of the Rooster for announcements. Three times, twenty-one shrine officials (one wearing court dress and cap) assembled at the attendants' building. Yin-yang masters, rotating offerers, purification leaders, purification attendants, administrators, chief administrators, officials, deputies, sacred vestment administrators, etc., first proceed to the shrine precincts (each person's attire is as usual; however, the official administrators move about the offering hall, attendants' building, etc.). After preparations are complete, the official administrator inquires about the sacred offering dispatch ceremony. At that time the head priest responds. Next, from the head priest down to the Sawada hafuri take their places at the earth building. Next, sacred vestments are dispatched from the attendants' building (first, the sacred vestment administrator proceeds to the shrine precincts. When the shrine officials have generally assembled, the white wood ritual chest that was at the sacred meal place is transported to the attendants' building. Two bearer sacred attendants and the sacred vestment administrator accompany it to the attendants' building and place it in the upper room. After from the head priest to the Sawada hafuri have taken their places at the earth building, as before, two bearer sacred attendants transport it before the sacred presence). When the two clan deity officials along with the sacred vestment administrator accompany each other past the earth building, each shrine official prostrates. At that time, the yin-yang administrator purifies them below the jewel bridge. From there, passing through the connecting hall, they enter the new shrine sacred gate, Chinese gate, etc., place them in the east corridor, and the two clan deity officials return to the earth building (however, the sacred vestment administrator remains by the ritual chest, though nowadays they often enter the shrine precincts to rest). Next, sacred offerings advance from the offering hall.

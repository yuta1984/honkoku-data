The manner is as follows: the negi faction enters from the south, and the celebrant faction from the north. Therefore, the celebrant faction passes in front of Nara shrine and enters the government office through the northern entrance. However, the chief priest and senior negi enter from the west of the board fence, while the other negi circle around to the south of the board fence to enter the government office. The chief priest sits in the center, the senior negi on the right, and the senior celebrant on the left, each facing east. The negi faction sits in a line facing north with west as the superior position, while the celebrant faction sits in a line facing south with west as the superior position. The purification leader sits next to the negi faction's ujigami negi, and the food servers sit next to the celebrant faction, each taking their seats.

After the shrine administrators withdraw from before the deity, the deputy senior official removes the tooth-hardening offerings.
The ritual proceeds as initially, with all transportation from the lower steps and kitchen staff duties being completed. When the evening offerings are removed, they are placed on top of the kara-bitsu chest and removed to the offering hall. The right side is all direct meeting for the chief priest (presumably). Therefore, it is placed in boats at the offering place and brought to the chief priest's residence. Particularly, the kitchen staff [Note: in purified garments] accompanies it [Note: However, at this time, two fans are placed on wooden boards by the kitchen staff and sent to the chief priest]. At this time, there is celebratory entertainment at the chief priest's residence.

Next, the outer sanctuary evening offerings are prepared and advanced [Note: The duty shrine administrators on rotation perform this role]. Previously, the daily offering kara-bitsu chests are advanced to the western offering place.

Two attendant porters and shrine servants accompanying the kitchen staff announce the sacred precedence. The locations are: between the third torii and stone bridge, next below the sacred tree, next the second torii, next around Hashimoto shrine, and then when entering the sun gate.

Next, the shrine officials advance to the earthen platform [Note: Previously they were seated at the senior negi seat. At this time there is guidance from the kitchen staff]. They perform one bow [Note: manipulating the hem as initially]. Next, they perform one bow at the great platform [Note: while seated]. Next, they place the left and right sacred serving trays directly on the great platform [Note: First the negi faction, then the celebrant faction. However, this is done after the senior officials advance to the earthen platform and complete one bow]. Next, five food servers on rotation duty perform this role. However, when there are impediments, absences, etc., it may be four or three people. Particularly, one person among them serves as senior official, while the remaining personnel perform the ritual of advancing below the advantage board level. Particularly, the manner of advancing is like the inner sanctuary deity offerings, being the ritual of receiving and transferring at the center of the temporary hall. It is essential not to carry past the center [Note: and so forth].

The deputy senior official advances [Note: Particularly there is guidance from the kitchen staff]. Next, they advance the left and right sacred eight-legged stands.
Particularly, there are sacred cloths. First the negi faction, then the celebrant faction. Particularly, after the senior official advances to the earthen platform and performs one bow, the food servers below receive these, ascend the steps, and pass them to the shrine officials. The following is the same as before.

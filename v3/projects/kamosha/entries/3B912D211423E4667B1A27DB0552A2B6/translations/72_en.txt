《they wait therefore this is delivered》. The divine servants take this and go outside the two torii, and when they return again, they announce "御先" (go-saki, "proceed first") 《three times》, finish, and the chief priest, Hafuri, and ritual abstainer deliver this, then the divine servants withdraw.

Next, the chief priest, Hafuri, ritual abstainer, and the shrine officials of the earthen building each finish their sacred offering feast and withdraw《however, except for the shrine officials, there is no feast ceremony》.

The pilgrimage is as usual《the procedure is that first the ritual attendant passes through the sacred chest offerings. First the chief Hafuri, then in order from the chief prayer master's wife and so on. The chief priest, as usual, need not pass through, and divine servants bring it to the village pavilion. The feast items are: for the chief priest, bird《one》, sea bream《one》, ray《four》; for the Hafuri, carp《one》, sacred bowl of rice《one》, ray《four》. Especially during single offerings, carp, bird and below alternate in feasts. The four from chief prayer master to Kataoka prayer master each receive sea bream《one》 and ray《four》. The sacred offerings of certain shrines are divided between two officials as usual. Also regarding ray distribution, during single offerings, one each is given in advance to ritual abstainer representatives and others, with ritual attendant and divine servant portions being the same as during multiple offerings. Other feast arrangements are as usual. Next, the Shirigi-Yatone prepares and advances clear sake along with one small earthenware cup with stand. From the next day's offerings, four raised portions are placed in the sacred chest. This is from the chief priest's feast where six raised portions are set aside, four of which the Yatone receives and passes through, with the remaining two being the offering place feast. The Nagoshi purification is the same as before, so there are no other sacred dishes. First at the seats under the eaves, it transfers from chief priest to Hafuri, from Hafuri to ritual abstainer, then in order to the earthen building shrine officials. Especially one cup is mutually transferred left and right. Next, sacred sweets are placed in the sacred chest and the minor administrator passes them through. Finishing, they rise and each crosses the ritual bridge, making pilgrimage from Iwamoto Shrine to Nara Shrine and withdrawing. However, shrine officials who completed pilgrimage first exit through the two torii and withdraw. Regarding the chief priest, Hafuri and others, after pilgrimage to Nara Shrine, they deliver rice varieties to the deputy Hafuri, deputy administrator and others at the west side of the board fence and withdraw》

Next, the deputy Hafuri, deputy administrator, ritual abstainer, and purification leaders go to the sacred rice field to perform the rice planting ceremony. The procedure is that the deputy administrator, ritual abstainer and others exit through the two torii from the shrine grounds, but regarding the deputy administrator, they pass through Nara stone bridge, enter through the three torii, proceed to the west side of the board fence and receive rice varieties from the chief priest. The deputy Hafuri also receives from the Hafuri at the same place《especially also receiving the handling chopsticks》. Again entering the three torii, passing through the stone bridge and east of the horse training ground, they head toward the Mitoyo-da field《also not taking torches but having lanterns carried》. The ritual abstainer, purification leaders and others do the same.

At this time, the deputy administrator, deputy Hafuri, ritual abstainer and others sit on long platforms or about two mats《west superior, facing south》. The procedure is to spread these in the upper part of the sacred field, slightly west of center. West of the chief priest's attendant role, since the administrator specializes in managing this matter, this becomes the seat of honor. Ritual abstainer in center, deputy Hafuri to the east.

Next they offer sacred sake. However, first at this time, the chief priest's attendant digs the rice field with a hoe, erects two sakaki branches and attaches four streamers《two sheets of half-paper with four streamers, one sheet each left and right》. Attaching these below the seedbed, they are placed in front of the sakaki and sacred sake is offered《especially prepared by both the deputy administrator and deputy Hafuri》. The sacred sake implements are one pair of pewter vessels, two pieces each of dried goods, cups three times, two earthenware vessels each, and about three gō of parched rice and black rice, about one gō of parched soybeans, etc. mixed together and placed separately in vessels. At this time, the deputy administrator and deputy Hafuri each place small amounts in two sacred serving trays. This is prepared by the chief priest and brought by attendants. After the offering, the Hafuri proclaims congratulatory words for a bountiful year, with two bows and two-stage clapping as usual. The purification leaders respond to this.

Next, they take out the rice varieties held by the deputy administrator, deputy Hafuri, ritual abstainer and others and plant them three times《sometimes planted before the ritual words》. Finishing, they remove the sacred sake, each partaking and withdrawing. Next they head to the eastern sacred field《the procedure is the same as for the prayer master's field, located to the left of the road outside Takegahana gate》. The procedure is that for the Hafuri's field, since sacred sake and below are prepared and advanced from within the shrine, each participates.

(The negi) takes precedence. During this time, the deputy administrator stops the torch. Next, the administrator informs Kataoka that the earth ritual has been completed. Next comes the prayer recitation by the five officials (both chief and deputy), clapping hands (everyone responds), and when finished, the deputy again takes up the torch (as in the beginning). The deputy shrine administrator proceeds to the small shrine and performs the sacred cleaning. The locations are the same as in the fourth month. Next, the deputy hafuri ascends to the deputy shrine and closes the sacred doors. At this time, everyone prostrates themselves. Next, the administrator advances the sacred lock wrapping (at this point, the sacred keys are handed to the administrator). Next, after wrapping the sacred lock, he returns to the hafuri side. Next, the chief and deputy negi cross the small courtyard and wait on the hafuri side. During this time, the deputy administrator advances to the small courtyard and holds the torch (as in the beginning). Next, the chief hafuri ascends to the great platform (with deliberation). Next, the head priest advances to the bottom of the steps, kneels in reverence, and waits on the hafuri side (the customary place). Next, the chief hafuri closes the sacred doors and everyone prostrates themselves. At this time, the administrator advances the sacred lock wrapping (as usual; at this point, the sacred keys are handed to the administrator). The hafuri takes it, finishes wrapping the sacred lock, and after one bow on the upper and lower steps, everyone withdraws from the hafuri side, makes a great circuit, and departs.

Regarding sending sacred lantern paper to the shrine grounds on the early morning before the Ainame-sai purification ritual.

During the purification sacred ritual, only the sacred paper candles are rotated while remaining seated below. Also, after the sacred cleaning is completed, sacred sakaki branches and day-shade grass are offered. The same applies to the deputy shrine (offering sakaki branches and day-shade grass occurs only when there are imperial instructions from the court). The same applies to certain shrines (when sacred brooms are offered, understand that sakaki branches and day-shade grass should also be offered together).

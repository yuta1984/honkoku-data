The dispatch proceeds as usual (today it is the sacred offerings for the hafuri side. Therefore, the offerings for the seven shrines are brought to the negi side, and the offerings for the main shrine hafuri side are brought to the hafuri side. Each is placed in sacred chests, with the sword-bearer holding them aloft, accompanied by the chief administrator and followed by the officials).
When passing the earth building, each shrine official prostrates, and the yin-yang master purifies them at the customary place. Next, the head priest and those below rise and advance to the divine presence, dividing left and right. At that time, the yin-yang master completes the purification of the shrine officials' bodies at the customary place, and the shrine officials take their seats in the east and west corridors (the route, advances, retreats, and bows are as usual). The purification attendants, purification leaders, etc. first take their customary seats. The deputy master advances to the small courtyard holding a torch. Next, sacred attendants bring two straw bags to the small courtyard (they are empty bags, tied in the middle with rope and stood side by side in the center of the standing sand. Mino paper is spread in the right bag and filled abundantly with washed rice; the right bag along with white rice, etc. are prepared and advanced by the sword-bearer). At that time, the chief administrator descends from the west corridor to the small courtyard, holds ritual earthenware vessels, and has the sacred attendants measure the sacred rice (this is the ceremony for presenting the new tax grain of the current year. For this ceremony, first the chief administrator places eleven ritual earthenware vessels on round trays and sets them on the sacred offering stand beside the east stairs of the assistant hall. First, one ritual earthenware vessel for the main shrine's portion is held by the chief administrator who descends to the small courtyard. At that time, the sacred attendants count "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine" like this three times, filling abundantly, dividing left and right and mutually counting six times to completion, then the chief administrator places it on the tray as before. Next, the main shrine hafuri side's portion is similarly prepared in this manner. The above makes eleven vessels total. Those portions are: two vessels for left and right portions, one vessel for the assistant hall, eight vessels for the eight shrines. The chief administrator holds each vessel and has the sacred attendants measure it completely, then the chief administrator places them on trays and brings them to the west offering shelf. The main shrine portion is placed on round trays, the eight shrines' portion is placed in sacred chests. The sacred attendants carry away the straw bags). Next, the administrator master advances the sacred key to the chief hafuri. The chief hafuri ascends the great platform and opens the sacred doors (at that time each person moves from their seat and prostrates). Next, the head priest and chief hafuri enter the inner sanctuary. From the chief negi to the clan deity hafuri, they divide left and right and wait above and below the stairs. The rotating offerers advance to their customary positions (first, after the sacred doors are opened, two junior attendants wait at the hafuri side). Next, the sacred blinds are rolled up (this is the chief hafuri's duty). Next, sacred chopsticks are advanced from the negi side (first making the proper announcement, and those below proceed as usual). The head priest takes them and offers them at the center of the great eight-legged offering stand. Next, sacred rice (placed in ritual earthenware vessels and set on round trays) is taken by the head priest and offered at the great eight-legged stand on the negi side. Next, sacred rice is advanced from the hafuri side (same as the negi side). Next, the sacred offerings: first sacred rice (placed in sacred bowls and set on round trays), next sacred carp (one fish, placed in covered ritual vessels), next sacred birds (one bird, same as carp), next sacred fresh offerings (five fish: one salted sea bream first placed in earthenware vessels, and all from the right sacred rice downward placed on round trays). All the above are taken by the chief hafuri and offered at the great eight-legged stand on the hafuri side. Next, the piled sacred offerings (fifty rays placed in sacred chests and offered on the sacred offering stand), next sacred confections (ten packages placed in sacred chests and offered on the third-tier shelf), next salted sardines (placed on wooden boards and offered on the second-tier shelf). All the above hafuri side portions are prepared by the chief hafuri (however, the round trays do not enter the inner sanctuary; when taking sacred offerings from the inner sanctuary, the round trays are removed to the negi side as usual).
Next, the komainu sacred offerings (one salted sea bream placed in a sacred chest, now offered to the komainu by the assistant negi from behind) and other rotating advances are completed, and the rotating offerers return to their seats. Next, sacred sake is advanced from the negi side (sacred cups and stands, etc. are as usual, placed on round trays and held aloft by the official master; the chief administrator fills them as usual below the assistant hall's sacred worship pillar). The head priest takes it and offers it at the first tier of the great eight-legged stand, then lowers the sacred blinds. Next, from the clan deity hafuri to the Kataoka hafuri, all return to their seats.
During this time, the chief administrator ascends to the assistant hall and offers sacred rice (after completely removing everything from the main shrine, the chief administrator also removes this).

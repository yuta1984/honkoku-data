When night falls, the assistant junior official offers the sacred lanterns.
On ordinary days, they light the main shrine left and right, the small auxiliary hall {{note: one on the eastern side}}, Kataoka {{note: negi side}}, Tanao {{note: one on the eastern side}} and other shrines {{note: only these}}, as well as three of the four golden lanterns in front of Tanao on ordinary days. Particularly, one is for Tanao Shrine, and two have benefactors, so all are lit. One circular lantern on the western side - this is a red (or perhaps "also") donated lantern. Although it exists, it is not lit on ordinary days. During the sacred ceremonies held for three periods within the first month {{note: only these}} and when daily offerings are presented, all are lit: the main shrine {{note: as usual, left and right two}}, auxiliary hall {{note: left and right}}, branch shrines each {{note: left and right}}, subordinate shrines, etc. However, for the tutelary deity, on days of daily offering presentation, wooden lanterns in the courtyard are lit, and during sacred ceremonies {{note: only then}} golden lanterns left and right are lit. Particularly for Ōta Shrine under the minor guardian's charge, regardless of sacred ceremonies or daily offerings, the minor guardian lights them every single day. Also, every year in the ninth month, during the latter fifteen days, regardless of daily offerings, all from the main shrine down are lit. The sacred oil expenses for the above come from the Ochida magistrate. The allocation is seven to and five shō, but in short months it is reduced by five shō.

Procedures for Preparing New Year's Day Teeth-Hardening Divine Offering Meal Service
First, six earthen high stands are placed on round trays and transported initially, then placed beside the sacred door on the negi side. Next, the teeth-hardening divine offerings are placed on top of them. Starting from the innermost area for the offerings, after the negi side's service is completed, the hafuri side performs the service. The ceremony is the same as for the negi side.

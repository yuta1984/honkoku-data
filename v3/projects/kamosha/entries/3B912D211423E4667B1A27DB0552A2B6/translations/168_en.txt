Next, the assistant administrator passes the sacred confections (kaya nuts and below, wrapped in paper).
When finished, the middle gate is closed. At that time, everyone prostrates and withdraws, crossing the sacred bridge.

The ceremony concludes (however, the shrine officials of Ōta clan deity hold a feast with sacred provisions at their shrine in the worship hall, and ask convenient nearby shrine officials to receive the sacred rice for them).

Next, sacred wrapped items《Note: Ten packages of sacred confections. However, there is no top placement, and the rest is the same as the liturgist faction》Next, salted sweetfish《Note: Same as before》Next, Koma offerings《Note: Same as liturgist faction. The deputy ritualist prepares this》Next,

Sacred sake is transferred forward from the liturgist faction《Note: Sacred cups《Note: With stands, each with metal fittings》are placed on round trays. Both sacred cups and stands are always kept in the deputy pavilion》

First, when the divine offering transfer from the ritualist faction is completed, the head of the offering bearers performs one bow《Note: While seated}} and returns to his seat. Furthermore, the two junior officials who proceeded to the ritualist faction also complete the divine offering transfer from the ritualist faction and return to the liturgist faction seats《Note: The manner is as in the beginning}}. Together, the deputy and director finish managing the ritualist faction and return to the liturgist faction. The director holds up the sacred cup, the deputy holds the sacred sake bottle, and they fill the sacred sake together from left and right. It is filled below the eastern sacred worship pillar of the authority hall《Note: However, it is filled while kneeling}}. The deputy announces the joint filling by liturgist and ritualist factions《Note: The offering bearers do not participate in this}}

Regarding the roles of deputy and director, until around the Meireki era there were five officials, but when other positions were vacant, it was customary for the deputy administrator, deputy, director and others to serve jointly. Due to this, thereafter all twenty-one positions were complete and filled. Moreover, from New Year's Day of Jōkyō 1, five offering bearers were appointed, but regarding sacred sake transfer, following the ancient form it remains the role of deputy and director, so the offering bearers do not participate. Now the deputy and director complete the ceremony of managing and the sake bottle is passed to the sword bearer《Note: sword bearer}}. Taking this, they carry it to the western offering place, arrange it on shelves, place it in cups for the seven shrines, and from the chest offerings the deputy administrator transfers them in order, with the chief liturgist advancing them to the inner sanctuary. The round tray is withdrawn to the liturgist faction, at which time below the main shrine's sacred worship pillar, the new shrine liturgist receives it, places it between the high railings, and waits by the western stairs.

Next, the sacred curtain is lowered. Next, the Ujigami ritualist and deputy administrator rise from their seats《Note: No seated bow}}, advance below the stairs, stand in line, perform one bow and return to their original seats《Note: However, seated bows and robe arrangement are as in the beginning}}. Next, Sawada ritualist with Ujigami liturgist, next Nara ritualist with Sawada liturgist, next Wakamiya ritualist with Nara liturgist, next Ōta ritualist with Wakamiya liturgist, next Shinmiya ritualist with Ōta liturgist, next Kibune ritualist with Shinmiya liturgist, next Kataoka ritualist with Kibune liturgist.

However, the Kibune liturgist often does not return to the original seat but withdraws to the ritualist faction and sits in the Kataoka ritualist's seat. After completing the main shrine liturgical words, both officials withdraw from the ritualist faction, make rounds visiting the various shrines, return to their lodgings to rest, change into pure vestments, and proceed to Kibune Shrine.

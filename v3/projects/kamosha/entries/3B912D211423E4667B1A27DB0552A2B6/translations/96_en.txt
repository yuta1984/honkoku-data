On the day of the Snake, the sacred enclosure is constructed (66 pillars, 33 reed door openings, 3 pieces of wood for the resting area, with sakaki placed at their ends).
On that day, there is a celebration within the sacred enclosure, and the menu is as follows:
　　(Spread with hinoki cypress leaves) Sushi　　(Navel earthenware) Ray fish piled high　Soup (Coarse soybeans)
　　　　　　Mullet (Finely cut) (Seasoned dish with mountain masu miso)　　　　Lacquered tray折敷
　　　　Yellowtail
　　　　　　Squid (Same preparation)　　　　　Rice
　　　　　　　(Navel earthenware) Pickles piled high　　Three offerings of sake, three sets of red bowls

On the festival day, there are three announcements for the divine attendants' pilgrimage, as is customary.

Regarding the divine offerings at Kifune Shrine, first the divine offerings of the inner sanctuary are prepared and completed, the negi returns to his seat, and the hafuri comes out from behind to prepare the outer sanctuary divine offerings. However, for the regular daily offerings, Sōichi serves as the leader and provides them.
Next, the hafuri arrives at the worship hall. Next, the offerings are transferred and the head priest advances to perform the Doi offering in the courtyard. Next, the negi and hafuri recite the ritual prayers from the worship hall (normally this is at Doi).

Special Festival (This is held on the middle day of the rooster. This festival was first performed by Emperor Uda, the 59th human emperor, on the last day of the rooster in the 11th month of the first year of Kanpyō. It is now discontinued. In ancient times, the ceremony was like that of the 4th month, but now, by decision of the shrine families, each year in the early 11th month, purification leaders are appointed and consult with the Kamo family to prepare and offer some collected rice and sacred offerings. When rice provisions are insufficient, they are provided from within the shrine community. Details of distribution methods can be found in the accounting records. When opening and storing the accounting box at the council place, the leaders consult together and announce the procedure to the shrine families, after which the box is stored in the triple-hand treasury).

Time limit (around the hour of the monkey): Shrine attendants provide guidance, and up to three times, shrine officials (wearing court dress and accompanied by one servant each; however, the two Kifune officials do not bring servants because they do not participate in this shrine's sacred ceremonies. However, the chief hafuri has two servants because they serve as advance guards carrying ceremonial items and sacred offerings, and during rain ceremonies they carry umbrellas) gather at the attendants' quarters (seating arrangements with left-right distinctions as usual; however, the chief hafuri sits in the main hall seat of the office building, as on September 9th).

However, the two Kifune officials do not follow this shrine but proceed to Kifune (around the hour of the rat, Ōta first visits the shrine. At this time, they inspect whether sacred offering implements are present at the offering hall. These items are listed in the inner sanctuary daily offerings section).

(Sacred offerings are placed in one sacred container and transported to Kifune. The two Kifune officials bring one person each, carry ritual offerings, and costume bearers serve as in every sacred ceremony.) The sacred doors are opened and sacred offerings are made to both inner and outer sanctuaries.

After completion, ritual offerings are made to nine shrines from the main shrine down to small shrines (these locations are: main shrine, temporary shrine, Kawao, Kuroo, general shrine, Ushi-issha, Ichishi, inner shrine, private shrine) (as usual; the two officials serve in alternating shifts. Details of the above procedures are found in the New Year's Day section, so they are omitted here). When finished, they withdraw.

Rotating offerers, purification leaders, yin-yang masters, administrators, deputies (clothing as in every sacred ceremony), ritual purifiers (wearing white robes with loose hair), etc., gather at the shrine grounds. First, the director and head priest visit the offering hall as usual. After all preparations are complete, the director comes to the attendants' place to inquire about the sacred offering dispatch ceremony (the head priest responds). Next, shrine officials arrive at the earth building. Next, sacred offerings depart from the offering hall. First the advance guard (role of shrine attendants), next sakaki branches and day-shade grass (regarding the order of erecting sacred offerings, the chief hafuri holds them as during the Double Yang Festival), next sacred sake vessels (abbreviated below? [written in red]), next daily offering sacred containers (morning provisions for both halls and portions for three shrines; loaded on top of sacred containers as in every ceremony), etc., are dispatched (Taguchi and others follow as usual; the director and head priest follow after the sacred offerings). When passing the earth building, shrine officials each prostrate. Next, the yin-yang master purifies the sacred offerings at the customary place. Next, sacred offerings arrive at the left and right offering places (the route is as during the Double Yang Festival; moreover, the chief hafuri's sakaki and day-shade grass are handed to the head priest, and arrival at the hafuri side and crossing the hall are also the same as before).

Next, the head priest and others proceed before the deity (dividing left and right). At this time, the yin-yang master purifies bodies (as usual). After completion, they take seats before the deity (route, advance and retreat, bowing and saluting as usual). Next, the rotating offerers, purification leaders (previously, they took seats as usual before the sacred offering dispatch), ritual purifiers (beside the eastern stairs), etc., take their customary places. Next, the deputy advances to the small courtyard and holds pine torches (however, if it is not twilight time, this ceremony is omitted). Next, the chief administrator passes the sacred keys to the chief hafuri, who rises and opens the sacred doors (bowing and saluting as usual). At this time, musicians perform music. Next, the head priest and others (move from seats and prostrate). Next, the head priest and hafuri (after advancing below the stairs and bowing once).

[The sacred wine] is offered at the center of the hollow bowls (perhaps the center of the sacred wine offering table) [Note: On the sacred offering table, the above is advanced seven times in total]. Next, the sacred curtain is lowered, then the negi exits the inner sanctuary and returns to his original seat. Next, the celebrant exits the inner sanctuary and performs one bow [Note: The ritual first involves the negi straightening the sacred offering table on the great platform]. Next, the sacred eight-legged table is advanced [Note: With spread silk, one leg]. The celebrant places it directly on the sacred offering table. Next, the divine offerings are advanced. The items are first sacred chopsticks [Note: One set, without stand], sacred rice [Note: Nine bowls, filled slightly in triangular arrangement, placed in small earthenware], salt [Note: One bowl, a small amount placed in a small vessel], sacred soup [Note: One piece of daikon radish, same earthenware as before], sacred pounded fish [Note: One bowl of ray scraps, same earthenware as before], sacred rice crackers [Note: One bowl, same earthenware as before], sacred dumplings [Note: One bowl with three pieces, placed in small eight-sided containers], sacred wine [Note: Served in earthenware, transported from Kamo in tubes], etc., loaded on round trays. The miko transfers and offers them, and the celebrant prepares them on the sacred eight-legged table [Note: For this ritual, see the transmitted diagrams. However, when there are additional imperial offerings, they are loaded on round trays and offered below the sacred eight-legged table, same as at Kamo Main Shrine].

After the above transfer of offerings is completed, the miko proceeds to Ushi-ichi Shrine and prepares the daily imperial offerings [Note: The items are the same as at the main shrine. However, since the main hall great platform of Ushi-ichi Shrine is narrow, they are offered at the temporary location]. At this time, the shrine attendants carrying the imperial offerings announce the earth ritual. Next, the celebrant prepares the outer sanctuary divine offerings and then performs the offering of sacred strips at the earthen platform.

The ritual involves both officials serving in alternating shifts. When it is the celebrant's turn, after preparing the outer sanctuary divine offerings, he descends to the earthen platform and immediately performs the offering of sacred strips. When it is the negi's turn, after the celebrant prepares and advances the outer sanctuary offerings, he removes them and passes them to the tōne. However, for Kifune sacred strip offerings, before Genroku 7 (1694), there were eight times per year: the five seasonal festivals, New Year's Day, the 15th of the same month, and the April festival. After that,

Seven times per year, among the five seasonal festivals, there is no sacred strip offering on the 7th day of the first month. There are New Year's Day, April festival, November extraordinary festival, etc. Sacred strip skewers are brought each year in December by the head carpenter: 32 sticks to the negi residence and 31 sticks to the celebrant residence [Note: For January 15th, the sacred strips from within the six districts of the sacred shelves are used concurrently, so the strips for the 15th are used for the April festival, it is noted].

Next, both officials proceed to the earthen platform, finish reciting the ritual prayers, and remove the outer sanctuary divine offerings [Note: During this time, does the negi return to his seat and the miko transfer offerings?]. After finishing, the sacred offering table is placed in its original location. Next, the negi and celebrant stand side by side, after performing one bow above and below, they enter the inner sanctuary, roll up the sacred curtain, and remove the inner sanctuary divine offerings.

The ritual first involves the sacred wine, next the sea bream and ray from the celebrant's side, next the rice cakes and shiitake leaves, next the sacred rice and sacred chopsticks, etc., completing the removal.
[Note: Next, does the negi remove the divine offerings [Note: Same as celebrant's side]?]

Next, they proceed to the sacred wiping, lower the sacred curtain, after placing the left and right sacred hollow bowls in their original locations, they finish wiping them. The negi performs one bow, exits the inner sanctuary, and returns to his original seat. Next, the celebrant performs one bow, exits the inner sanctuary, and closes the sacred doors [Note: Prior to this, the negi and others show their readiness]. At this time, they move from their seats and prostrate. Next, the miko advances the sacred lock wrapping [Note: This sacred lock wrapping is prepared and advanced by the miko. However, in this sequence, the celebrant passes the sacred key to the miko]. The celebrant finishes wrapping the sacred lock and goes up and down the stairs.

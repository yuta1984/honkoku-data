(Regarding whether it would be appropriate to recite norito prayers at the place where [offerings] are prepared, as one interpretation: after completing the inner sanctuary affairs and closing the sacred doors, then setting up the sacred offering table (one stand) again on the great platform and offering the sacred box divine offerings—this procedure is incorrect, as was conveyed from Elder Seiashi Ushio. This is due to the strict preparation and advancement of divine offerings for the eight shrines' outer sanctuaries during festivals, and so forth.)

(On Aoi Festival day, there are secret esoteric teachings regarding the procedure of placing hollyhock and katsura in the inner sanctuary. In the 48th year of Hōreki [1758], when I was serving as deputy negi, Hafuri Senior Fourth Rank Upper Tomisei did not provide the proper instruction, so having also been serving concurrently in the negi position, I inquired of Elder Seiashi Ushio, who indicated that it should be done according to proper procedure, so although I was in a deputy position, I performed [the ritual]. The hafuri does not participate in this procedure.)

Next, the head negi and assistant negi perform one bow up and down, and the head negi proceeds directly to the norito recitation hall (the procedure is to go through the side door of the transparent corridor, pass along the outer veranda of the norito hall, and open the side door to enter. When entering the norito hall, after the proper time has passed, one bows and opens the side door). The assistant negi and hafuri return to their original seats. Next, the chief priest and hafuri exit the inner sanctuary, perform one bow, descend the stairs (gathering their hems), perform one bow and proceed to the norito hall (however, the head hafuri follows the same procedure as the head negi, while the chief priest proceeds directly to the round cushion without passing through the outer veranda). Next, the assistant negi (bowing from their seat and rising) proceeds to the bottom of the stairs, performs one bow, ascends to the great platform and prepares the left and right sacred offering tables on the great platform. Next, the assistant hafuri rises and proceeds to the bottom of the stairs and performs one bow. Next, the negi side's transferred offering attendant rises and proceeds to the sacred eight-legged table (two stands with altar cloths, including silk). The assistant hafuri takes this, ascends the stairs and hands it to the assistant negi (same as before for worship). The assistant negi takes it and places it on top of the sacred offering table (first the negi side, then the hafuri side). Next, they advance the outer sanctuary divine offerings. The procedure begins with sacred rice, sacred chopsticks, salt, sake, and three-cut items.

(One name is "ground division." Three cuts of ray are arranged in four cloth-mesh bowls and placed on round trays.) The assistant negi takes these and offers them to the negi side. Next, the same as before (offering to the hafuri side). Next, high arrangements (eight bowls—though called "several cuts of ray," the number is within ten. One bowl is Azumi River high arrangement, substituting for carp but usually sea bream; during festivals one bowl of carp, pheasant, usually ray placed on round trays) are offered to the negi side. Next, goby (one bowl), dumplings (three bowls), sacred sake (first offering, with cloth-mesh, offered to the negi side together with stand). Next, sacred soup (daikon radish or lettuce), tide-boiled (one cut of ray placed in cloth-mesh), cold soup (a little sake served in cloth-mesh), vinegar (served in round earthenware), sliced fish (eleven cuts of sea bream, all high arrangements; regular practice uses salted mackerel), flat cuts (three cuts of thin, long ray), flat items (same as above), kawahagi (eleven cuts of sea bream, all high arrangements; regular practice uses salted mackerel), wood cuts (ray about two inches long cut into four pieces and arranged), torn items (about seven cuts of ray, torn and added), grilled items (one cut of mackerel, though for festivals it may be sea bream), etc. are offered to the negi side. Next, high arrangements (eight bowls offered to the hafuri), then sōmen noodles and below same as before (offered to hafuri side, however at this time the second offering of sacred sake is offered to the negi side). Next, sacred soup and below same as before (offered to hafuri side). Next, on high stands, one goby and three dumplings are placed in earthenware, first to the negi side, then to the hafuri side. Next, small sweetfish (five fish) are placed on round trays and prepared on top of the sacred offering table (under the negi side's sacred eight-legged table). After completion, the assistant hafuri performs one bow at the bottom of the stairs and proceeds to the norito hall (the procedure is the same as the head negi).

Next, the assistant negi performs one bow up and down and proceeds to the norito hall (the procedure is the same as the head negi). Next, the assistant director, hearing the Kataoka earth festival, takes a seat at the Wakamiya negi position (directly from the meeting place). Next, the five officials rise and perform two bows; at this time the assistant descends to the drop veranda and announces that the earth festival is completed. Next, the five officials recite norito prayers, clap their hands (the assembly responds), complete two bows, and the assistant negi rises, proceeds to the bottom of the stairs, performs one bow and ascends to the great platform.

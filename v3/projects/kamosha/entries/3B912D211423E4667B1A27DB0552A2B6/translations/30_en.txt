On the cut grass area, the negi (senior priests) and hafuri (junior priests) separate and take their seats.
The negi side sits in the western seats facing east with northern precedence, while the hafuri side sits in the eastern seats facing west with northern precedence. This is the lowest level, but for both ceremonies there is a formal response ceremony at the imperial residence.

The Seasonal Sacred Ceremony Procedures mention "four-direction worship" - what does this refer to? In the elder brother's year, the hafuri side goes first; in the hafuri's year, it begins with the negi. Each performs two bows in a single line. However, during one-direction worship, they perform one bow while remaining seated.

After completion, they make a pilgrimage to Ōta Shrine {{Note: processional seal and key, distant shrine worship}} and withdraw.

The divine offerings are removed and distributed as initially done. The deputy administrator receives them, places them in sacred chests, has the tone officials transport them, distributes them at the offering hall, and passes the direct meeting [feast] to the seats of the shrine officials.

However, among the above items, kokaki, zakko, neduka (possibly daikon radish), melons, eggplants placed on top of the layered imperial offerings, shrimp, and koma imperial offerings, etc., are for the deputy administrator's direct meeting. The pheasant substituting for large carp is for the head priest's direct meeting, so the head priest's associates receive it at the Western Imperial Food Office.

Sacred sake, tsumi imperial offerings placed on top of hōtō, skewered persimmons and citrus placed on top, and two pieces of ray fish from the layered imperial offerings, etc., are for the assistant senior official's direct meeting. Also, two pieces each of ray fish from the layered imperial offerings go to the purification child and deputy. However, the portions for the purification child and deputy are received and brought by the assistant deputy. For twenty-one tone officials, thirteen pieces - five pieces for the upper [officials] and eight pieces for the lower. The upper five people attend without fail, but the tone officials assigned to the eight shrines alternate attendance, one person per sacred ceremony. Accordingly, the ray fish direct meetings follow this pattern {{Note: etc.}}. For the divine attendants, of the two pieces, one piece goes to one of the two divine attendants on duty who brings the divine offerings in sacred chests to the head priest's residence, and the remaining piece is given because they bring a small amount of takii rice called "kaihigenomi" to the deputy administrator for each sacred ceremony. However, this only applies during comprehensive imperial offerings; there is no such ceremony during partial imperial offerings {{Note: etc.}}. One piece each of hōtō and shiiba-mochi from the imperial withdrawal is sent from the assistant senior official to the musicians (possibly per person). This is done separately in this manner. They are placed on a single wooden board. However, if forgotten on New Year's Day, they are sent within seven or fifteen days.

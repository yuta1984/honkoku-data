Following the earthen area, the sacred curtains are rolled up. Next, the sacred broom and cloths are presented (as materials for left and right: four sacred brooms and two sacred cloths. Two straw brooms are fully wrapped with one sacred cloth and placed in the sacred chest).

Both officials take the sacred broom and cloths and place them at the edge of the sacred offering stand. All the left and right ceremonial objects that had been stored are placed entirely in the sacred chest (however, the manner of removing the sakaki branches is oral tradition). These are removed, and the attendants take them and pass them to the sword negi. Next, the sacred curtains are lowered. Next, there is sacred cleaning. First, both officials take the sacred broom and cloths and sweep and wipe the sacred curtained platform, outer veranda, and the承塵 (decorative ceiling) and below (however, not sweeping strongly with straw brooms is ancient practice). Of the two sacred brooms, one specifically sweeps the ceiling edges of the sacred curtained platform and the承塵, while one sweeps below the sacred curtained platform (however, in ancient times they were divided into upper and lower using left-twist and right-twist). Above the sacred mats, located beside the left and right sacred doors, they are swept with bud brooms. When the sacred cleaning is completed, of the two brooms, two sacred cloths are wrapped around the base of the broom that swept above, and they are removed together to the outer sanctuary (first negi, then hafuri). The attendants on both left and right take them, and those with sacred cloths wrapped use the sacred broom for the inside and outside of the sacred doors (closing each door leaf completely for sweeping and wiping - first the negi side, then the hafuri side), while those without wrapping use the sacred broom to completely wipe the great floor and railings below, then pass them to the sword negi and return to the worship hall. Next, the称宜 and hafuri bow once and exit the inner sanctuary, performing upper and lower

bows and returning to the worship hall. Next, they rise and bow twice while reciting norito (however, Wakamiya, Shinmiya, etc. listen to what the Kataoka earth festival recites). Clapping twice and bowing. The hafuri (with seated bow) crosses over the seat, advances to the earthen area for one bow, ascends to the great floor for one bow, and closes the sacred doors (moving from seats and prostrating). Next, the attendants wrap the sacred lock and pass it to the hafuri before withdrawing. The hafuri takes it and completes wrapping the sacred lock, bows once, descends the stairs and bows once. The negi rises and withdraws.

Next, they make a great circuit, enter the second torii, and take respite at the shrine precincts.

Next, the deputy hafuri, deputy negi, chief negi, chief hafuri, etc., after bowing above and below, arrive at the norito house from outside the覽間 (viewing space) (when passing through the sacred front center, each respectfully bends and enters through the妻戸 side door). The head priest, after bowing above and below, takes his seat at the norito position from inside the覽間 (each without seated bowing).

Next, having heard in advance of the Kataoka earth festival, they take the Wakamiya negi seat. Next, the five officials rise and bow twice. Next, having descended in advance to the lower veranda, they announce that the earth festival has ended. Next, the five officials recite norito and clap twice with bows. Next, the chief negi, deputy宮negi, hafuri, etc. rise and cross the small courtyard to join the hafuri side. Next, the chief hafuri rises (from outside the覽間) and advances to the bottom of the stairs for one bow, ascends to the great floor for one bow (respite). Next, the head priest rises and advances to the bottom of the stairs for one bow, waiting on the hafuri side (below the sacred worship pillar, above the inch-edge board). Next, the hafuri closes the sacred doors (everyone prostrates).

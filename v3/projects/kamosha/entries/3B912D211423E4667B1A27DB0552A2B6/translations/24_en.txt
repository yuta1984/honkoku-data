The negi places them in layers on the great platform, taking one tray at a time and loading it with divine offerings from the inner sanctuary [Note: The chief priest and celebrant have the senior negi carry them]. The method of sequential removal is the same as before for each.

The ritual first involves the celebrant's side divine offerings: salt and sweetfish, next wrapped imperial provisions, next stacked imperial provisions, next fresh imperial offerings [Note: one throat], next the same, next the same, next the same, next the same, next imperial birds, next imperial carp, next shiiba leaves, next rice cakes, next the same, next blown items, next fern-frond rice [Note: Each of the above is removed by the senior celebrant]. Next, for the negi's portion: first salt and sweetfish, next large carp [Note: substitute for pheasant], next wrapped imperial provisions, next stacked imperial provisions, next fresh imperial offerings, next the same, next the same, next the same, next the same, next eggplant and melon [Note: removed at once], next leeks and radish [Note: removed at once together with two wooden pieces], next various throat items [Note: removed at once together with two wooden pieces], next kogaki [Note: removed at once], next imperial birds, next imperial carp, next shiiba leaves, next rice cakes, next the same, next fern-frond rice, next toso (spiced sake), next imperial sake [Note: However, is this ritual removed first?], next imperial chopsticks, next left and right komainu imperial provisions [Note: first celebrant's side, then negi's side].

[Note: Now the komainu imperial provisions are removed. Is the celebrant's side removed at the beginning of the celebrant's portion?] [Note: Is it removed at the beginning of the negi's portion?]

Generally, about thirty-two or thirty-three round trays are needed for the removal. However, since each divine ritual differs, the offering transferrers should understand this well.

Next, the imperial cleaning cloths are advanced [Note: Four sheets of white paper, paperweights, round earthenware vessels, etc. are placed on round trays and prepared and advanced by the senior official. However, these round trays are sequentially removed from the senior negi to the Shingu celebrant, placed narrowly between the railings, and the Shingu celebrant waits in line at the negi's side. Up to this point, the divine offerings are transferred at the base of the sacred worship pillar].

Next, the sacred curtain is lowered. Next, from the Wakamiya celebrant to the Shingu celebrant, they wait at the celebrant's side [Note: It states "respectfully bending," in one line, particularly as at the beginning, after one bow, each withdraws to the celebrant's side]. The offering transferrers return [Note: However, this should be done at an appropriate interval after removing the inner sanctuary divine offerings]. One small karakitsu chest of white wood [Note: On small festival days, the monthly attendants take this from the sacred treasure storehouse and place it in the direct meeting place] is transported from the direct meeting place [Note: by porters and shrine servants] and placed outside the celebrant's side Chinese gate [Note: north side facing east]. The Imperial Wardrobe Deputy [Note: purification robes and hakama] accompanies this [Note: The Imperial Wardrobe Deputy waits on the east side facing west beside the Chinese chest].

The lid of the small karakitsu chest is advanced to the inner sanctuary [Note: After completely removing all divine offerings, at this time from the Wakamiya celebrant to the Shingu celebrant, each waits at the celebrant's side. At this time, they perform a lateral bow at the center of the main shrine. From the celebrant's side, the Imperial Wardrobe Deputy takes the lid and passes it to the Wakamiya celebrant, who then sequentially transfers and advances it to the inner sanctuary]. At this time, the sacred curtain is rolled up. Next, the summer divine garments are removed. The items are first the imperial lined robe [Note: white silk with two-leaf hollyhock pattern, lined with habutae silk], imperial layered robes [Note: imperial train continuation gauze, red with two-leaf hollyhock scattered pattern], imperial cord belt [Note: white], next imperial train [Note: gauze with attached gold deep hollyhock vine pattern], imperial single robe [Note: red silk with horizontal diamond pattern], imperial red hakama [Note: red refined silk], next imperial cypress fan [Note: white wood with two-leaf hollyhock pattern, with butterfly and bird design], imperial court robe [Note: white gauze with hollyhock vine pattern], imperial outer hakama [Note: flattened silk with hollyhock vine pattern, round-lined habutae with river beating], etc., loaded on the lid and removed [Note: three or four times by the Imperial Wardrobe Deputy].

[Note: Stored in the small karakitsu chest and transported to the direct meeting place as before, with a tag attached, and later stored in the sacred treasure storehouse by the monthly attendants]. Next, the sacred curtain is lowered. Next, from the Wakamiya celebrant to the senior negi...

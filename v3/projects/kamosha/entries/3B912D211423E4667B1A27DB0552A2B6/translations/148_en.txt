Procedures for Rain Ceremonies at the Bridge Hall Carriage Approach
　The ceremony is conducted in the earthen floor of the bridge hall carriage approach. The ritual procedures follow the same precedents as for clear weather. However, both officials do not lower their hems, and when the shrine maiden presents documents for imperial viewing, she goes around behind the narrow hall, proceeds to the narrow hall, and enters within the blinds. The document inspection ceremony is conducted at the bridge hall carriage approach as in clear weather. Everything else follows the same precedents as clear weather.

October 30th Rice Harvest Ceremony (The Kanbun 9 shrine record states that the rice harvest should take place in the first month) Using the Seisoku Record

Arriving at the appointed time of half past the hour of the Monkey (First, about an hour earlier, the arrow sword-bearer comes to the deputy shrine administrator's residence to announce that he will participate. At that time, he is instructed to also notify the assistant ritualist, abstinence children, etc.)

The deputy shrine administrator and assistant ritualist (each wearing court dress with one attendant each), abstinence children (wearing white robes and loose hair with one female servant), etc. proceed to the sacred sealed rice field (the eastern rice field, with the arrow sword-bearer carrying two sakaki branches hung with four streamers, following along). They have the sacred farmer set up the outer rice stalks, prepare sakaki branches, offer sacred sake, and recite ritual prayers.

　The ceremony: each person arrives at the southern part of the sacred sealed rice field (called "below the basket," where seats are prepared in advance (one mat) - the ritualist gate official facing west and south, the deputy shrine administrator in the center west, abstinence children in the east, assistant ritualist)

　At this time the sacred farmer (ritualist attendant) takes up a sickle for the outer rice stalks (having previously left about one bundle of the aforementioned rice in the center of the sacred sealed rice field, wrapped around with straw and placed there), brings it from the east and places it at the southern edge below the basket, unties the bundle cord and lets it dry in the shade. However, in recent times it is dried outside before the appointed time, and after everyone arrives below the basket, this becomes the formal procedure. Next, have the arrow sword-bearer set up sakaki in front of the rice stalks (two sakaki branches with four streamers of half-sheets of paper hanging down, but hang one sheet each to the left and right). Sacred sake is prepared (for the inner service of the deputy shrine administrator, assistant ritualist, etc., the items are: one pair of tin vessels, two pieces of side dishes each, two pieces of triple sake cups each, roasted rice (three gō six shaku of black rice), roasted beans one gō, combined total. The Shigemura Record says that in addition to the above, two pieces of kelp are added, but this is not done now. Put into two small folding containers. The sacred sake implements, sakaki, etc. are provided by the administrative staff. Therefore, when proceeding, the council office caretaker brings them along) Two bows in two stages

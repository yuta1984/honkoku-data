(For the customary seating, since the shrine officials take their seats, it is appropriate to seat them in a single row across three or four circular cushions). Next, the chief administrator passes the sacred key to the assistant hafuri (the route is as usual, but when withdrawing, they do not pass through the center of the assistant shrine but withdraw directly through the transparent corridor to the direct meeting place). During this time, the deputy withdraws to the small courtyard, advances to the assistant shrine courtyard, and holds the pine torch (the procedure involves summoning shrine attendants after exiting the fence gate to hold torches in the assistant shrine courtyard, receiving them as usual).

Next, the assistant hafuri (passing through the center of the main shrine; since holding the sacred key, knee-walking is not required, perhaps a lateral bow) advances to the assistant shrine (bowing and handling robes like the chief hafuri). The sacred doors are opened (as at the main shrine). At this time, musicians perform music (the procedure for stopping the music below is the same as at the main hall, so it is abbreviated). The head priest and below prostrate themselves (each moves from their seat; however, shrine officials seated on the negi side form a single north-facing line when the assistant hafuri opens the sacred doors and ascends). Next, the assistant negi rises and advances to the earthen platform (however, before the assistant hafuri descends from the great platform, they knee-walk toward the negi side and handle their robes). The assistant hafuri descends the stairs (handling robes). They stand together, bow once, ascend the great platform, bow once, and enter the inner sanctuary (in the inner sanctuary, they first bow once, then both officials carry the large eight-legged table by hand and prepare it on the sacred table tray; all matters are the same as at the main shrine). Next, the two Kataoka officials (the negi knee-walks through the center space of the assistant shrine like the assistant negi; the hafuri moves laterally through the center space of the main shrine; the same when withdrawing) advance to the earthen platform, stand together, bow once, then wait on the great platform (left and right). Next, the two Shingu officials wait at the second level of the stairs. Next, the two Ōta officials wait at the fifth level of the stairs. Next, the negi and hafuri of Wakamiya, Nara, Sawada, and clan deities divide left and right and wait below the stairs (each bowing as at the main shrine). Next, the sacred curtains are rolled up (role of the assistant hafuri). Next, sacred offerings are advanced in rotation. First, the advance guard is announced from the negi side (same as before below, so abbreviated). Sakaki and day-shade grass are offered (same as the main shrine). Next, the same from the hafuri side (previously, two junior rotating offerers waited at the hafuri side after the assistant shrine doors were opened, and the procedure for rotating sacred offerings is as at the main shrine; specifically, the clan deity hafuri hears the sound of the hafuri side's advance guard, rises, passes through the center of the main shrine, proceeds with reverent bowing to the advantage boards near the hafuri side, and receives sacred offerings from the rotating offerers. At that time, the Sawada hafuri rises at the center of the main shrine to receive them and advances in sequence from there. Not carrying through the center of the main shrine is like how the rotating offerers serve in every sacred ceremony). Next, sacred chopsticks are offered from the negi side (as at the main shrine, there is always a preparatory pavilion, so they are offered by the chief administrator. The arrangement is as at the main shrine: one set for the negi side by the assistant negi, one set for the hafuri side by the assistant hafuri, offered on the large eight-legged table, so abbreviated).

Next boat rice offerings, next boat rice cakes, next sacred carp (substitute: one salted sea bream; lids, bedding, earthenware vessels, etc. same as main shrine), next sacred birds (substitute: six strips of dried squid tied with kudzu vine; lids, bedding and below same as before), next sacred fresh items (five portions, offered five times), next layered sacred provisions (quantities as at main shrine), next sacred sweets (Kataoka hafuri unwraps packages and presents to inner sanctuary), next salted anchovies, next komainu provisions (offered by Kataoka negi. The above sacred sakaki, day-shade grass, and sacred offerings below are all the same as the main shrine, but only carp and birds use substitutes. The chief administrator manages the presentation, advancing in sequence through the left stairs to enter the inner sanctuary. However, circular trays do not enter the inner sanctuary but are withdrawn to the hafuri side. At this time, the Nara hafuri receives them and places them on a vermillion-lacquered sacred desk beside the eastern stairs of the assistant shrine. This is the sacred desk where the head of rotating offerers places circular trays in every sacred ceremony). Next, from the hafuri side, rice offerings through komainu provisions are advanced in rotation. The items are the same as the negi side before, so abbreviated (the above are managed by the chief administrator and director, advancing in sequence through the right stairs to enter the inner sanctuary. At this time, circular trays do not enter the inner sanctuary; after the assistant hafuri takes the sacred offerings, they are withdrawn to the negi side and placed on the sacred offering shelf. Also, the Kataoka negi unwraps the sacred sweet packages, and the hafuri similarly offers komainu provisions. All procedures are the same as the main shrine).

After all rotating presentations are completed, the rotating offerers (two junior attendants), chief administrator, director, etc. return to the negi side and offer sacred sake (sacred cups and stands, each of metal objects; there is always a preparatory pavilion. Both sacred cups and stands are placed on circular trays, held by directors, and the chief administrator fills them below the crossing hall pillars. As at the main shrine, they announce combined filling for left and right. The rotating offerers do not participate in this. However, for sacred sake, no separate sake flask is prepared as the assistant shrine's portion from the offering hall; it is filled from one sake flask location of the main shrine hafuri side). Next, the sacred curtains are lowered (by assistant hafuri). Next, from the junior attendants (both clan deity officials), they advance in line below the stairs, bow once, then return to their seats (however, the Kataoka negi does not return to seat but descends directly through the transparent corridor to proceed to Kataoka, the procedure as in every sacred ceremony).

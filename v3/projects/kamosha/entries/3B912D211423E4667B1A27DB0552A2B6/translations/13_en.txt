They return to the shrine grounds. Ōta Shrine is always at the oshi (shrine guide) residence. Ujigami Shrine is at the komori (minor guardian) residence. Therefore they are opened before the ceremony.

The key to Ōta Shrine was formerly the same as Ujigami Shrine. At present there is no komori at Ōta Shrine, so there is an oshi residence. Therefore, midway they summon the key from the oshi residence and retrieve it to open the doors of the viewing space. Afterward, the key is returned to the oshi residence.

However, regarding the offering bearers, at Kataoka and Wakamiya shrines, those on duty at the shrine grounds attend. At Ōta, Shinmiya, Nara, Sawada, Ujigami and others, five purification leaders attend in rotation according to shrine custom.

They immediately proceed to offer the tooth-hardening ceremony to the liturgist side of the large platform and take their seats in the worship hall.

In this ceremony, first they perform one bow at the earthen platform, then the sword attendant brings the sacred offerings for the tooth-hardening ceremony, so they receive these and ascend to the large platform. They approach the komainu (lion-dogs) on the liturgist side and make offerings there. They perform one bow and withdraw. The items are: first, one mirror rice cake, one package of ai-shaped items, one package of nebuka leeks, etc. These three items on the right are placed on five-sun wooden boards. Next, one kai lid cup, two cups of high-piled sushi, two cups of high-piled radish, etc. are placed on seven-sun wooden boards and set on raised earthen platforms. These items on the right are put into sacred containers together with the sacred offerings of the inner sanctuary and transported. Therefore they are all brought out in the worship hall and offered first《Note: Do the offering bearers prepare these?》

Next, the ritualist rises from his seat, proceeds forward, ascends the large platform, and opens the sacred doors.

In this ceremony, first he rises without a seated bow, descends to the worship hall. There is no footwear bow. He proceeds to the earthen platform《Note: However, with knees bent》. He arranges his robe hem (or does not arrange his robe hem?). With his right hand he performs one bow, proceeds to the large platform and performs one bow《Note: While seated, however not holding the robe hem》. He approaches the left and right komainu, places the sacred chain wrapping and sacred chain lid etc. to the side at the rear, adds the sacred key and opens the sacred doors《Note: Three full cuts》. Prior to this, the shrine officials and offering bearers in the worship hall observe the situation, and at that time each moves from their seat, finishes prostrating, performs one bow, descends the steps, and arranges their robe hems.

At present there is no ceremony of approaching the komainu.

Next, the liturgist rises from his seat and proceeds to the earthen platform.

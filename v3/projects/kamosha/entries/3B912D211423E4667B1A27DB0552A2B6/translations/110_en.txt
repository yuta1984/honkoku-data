The items for the feast for the deputy chief administrator and below are the same as for the Tsuchi-no-ke Festival.

(The shrine officials from Kataoka and below should bring proper paper for wrapping materials. Clean white paper is appropriate)

(On the 24th day of the 4th month of Hōreki 8 [1758], at the Rice Planting Festival, since the deputy chief priest of Ōta was also serving in official duty, today the chief priest and below took their seats in the connecting hall to the right of the sacred presence seats, but the ritual child did not attend. At this time, deputy Kanesuke brought the sacred key and proceeded to the transparent corridor, but at this moment chief priest Tomehisa said, "Since the minor ritual child has not come, we should wait and see for a while." Due to this, the deputy returned to the western offering shelf as is. Later, the ritual child Hakukenjo came to duty and took her usual seat. After that, the ritual before the sacred presence began. In other words, since the ritual child was late today, the question was whether to wait for a while)

(Today's sequence for the sacred offering feast)

(First, the outer sanctuary evening offerings [upper three officials and ritual children arrange moon shapes] and sacred vegetables of ray fish [two pieces placed in cloth-textured vessels] etc. are prepared on food mats. Seats are determined and the stone shrine attendants distribute them, placing them in sacred chests and bringing them. However, the five officials hold these in front of Sawada Shrine and take their seats. Next, the ladled offerings [brought by shrine attendants]. Next, distribute the sacred chest offerings. Next, announce the sacred chopsticks)

(Next, the minor deputy distributes sacred confections. Next, Yatone distributes small utensils. Next, the minor representative distributes shiri-i [clear sake, cups, cloth-textured earthenware]. Shrine attendants distribute shiri-i [cups same as before]. Next, clear away the feast utensils. Next, after Yatone distributes the ceremonial items and makes the announcement, everyone rises from their seats)

(Regarding today's court musicians not attending duty, according to casual conversation by Toyo Iga-no-kami, attendance at Kamo is limited to the five seasonal festivals, Aoi Festival, special festivals, Ainamesai, and New Year's White Horse sacred ritual, with no attendance at other times)

(This year it was decided that the Aoi Festival would be held at the government office on the 18th day of the 4th month and the Rice Planting Festival on the 23rd day of the 4th month, but at the meeting on the 19th, it was rescheduled for the 22nd)

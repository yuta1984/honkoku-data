They enter the inner sanctuary. Next, from the senior negi to the clan deity hafuri, they wait in alternating positions on the stairs above (or below?). Next, the rotating offerers proceed to their customary places. Next, the sacred curtains are rolled up (this is the role of the chief hafuri). Next, sakaki branches and day-shade grass are offered from the negi side (the advance guard as usual - two small sakaki branches with day-shade grass wound around and attached to the sakaki, placed on a small round seat and set on a circular tray. Both items are prepared by the yatone offering officials. However, day-shade grass began to be prepared from the sixth year of Enpō). The head priest offers these (on the second-tier shelf of the large eight-legged table, positioned toward the negi side). Next, the same is done from the hafuri side (ceremonial items, same as the negi side. However, two junior rotating offerers wait at the hafuri side after the main shrine doors are opened and then advance in rotation. The procedure is as usual, with the director managing the presentation). The chief hafuri offers these (same as the negi side, but positioned toward the hafuri side). Next, sacred chopsticks etc. are offered from the negi side (as usual, the head priest offers them in the center of the first-tier of the large eight-legged table facing inward. One set from the negi side head priest is offered as usual, detailed in the diagram). Next, boat rice offerings (two boats placed on wooden planks and set on circular trays. The boat dimensions and lids are the same as in the Aoi Festival. However, after filling with rice, the lid vines are tied in the center, and after pointing to two places together, the chief administrator receives them. The same for the eight shrines. Kudzu vine is prepared by the yatone officials). Next, boat rice cakes (same as rice offerings, but ten ornamental rice cakes with a small amount of azuki beans placed in the center. Tied in the middle with kudzu vine, prepared by the chief administrator). Next, sacred carp (one fish placed in an earthenware vessel, covered with cypress leaves as a lid and placed on a circular tray. However, from the second year of Jōkyō, real carp has been offered; previously, one salted sea bream was used as a substitute). Next, sacred birds (one male pheasant; earthenware vessel, lid, and bedding same as before. This is also prepared the same as carp; previously six strips of dried squid were used as substitute). Sacred fresh items (five portions: one portion of salted sea bream offered five times; lids, bedding, earthenware vessels same as for carp. From sacred chopsticks to fresh items above, each is offered on the first tier of the large eight-legged table, specifically on the negi side). Next, layered sacred provisions (placed in sacred containers, quantities as usual, offered on top of sacred table trays). Next, sacred sweets (ten packages placed in sacred containers, varieties as usual, including spoons; the assistant negi unwraps packages and presents them to the inner sanctuary as usual). Next, salted Japanese anchovy (offered on the second tier as in every sacred ceremony; details found in the New Year's Day section; placed on wooden planks with lids and bedding, set on circular trays. After sacred withdrawal, shrine officials hold council in order for the direct meeting). Next, komainu provisions (as usual; details in the September 9th section. The senior negi offers these afterward. The above sacred offerings, like every sacred ceremony, are advanced and presented to the inner sanctuary in sequence by the chief administrator. At this time, circular trays do not enter the inner sanctuary. After the head priest takes the sacred offerings, they are withdrawn to the hafuri side. The procedure is as usual). Next, boat rice offerings are advanced from the hafuri side (the items are the same as the negi side. The chief hafuri offers them on the first-tier shelf of the large eight-legged table. Below, all are offered by the chief hafuri. The arrangement has left-right distinctions only; the procedure is the same as the negi side). Next boat rice cakes, next sacred carp, next sacred birds, next sacred fresh items (five portions), next layered sacred provisions, next sacred sweets (the senior negi unwraps packages and presents them to the inner sanctuary as usual, but the hafuri side has no spoons), next salted anchovies, next komainu provisions (offered by the assistant negi. The rice offerings and below are the same as the negi side. The chief administrator and director advance and present to the inner sanctuary in sequence. Circular trays are withdrawn to the negi side. The procedure is as usual), etc. The rotating offerers (two junior attendants), chief administrator, director, etc. return to the negi side. Next, sacred sake is offered (the chief administrator and director present it as usual; the head priest offers it on the first tier of the large eight-legged table). After completion, the sacred curtains are lowered. Next, from the junior attendants (clan deity hafuri), they stand in line, advance below the stairs, bow once, then return to their seats. Next, the senior negi, head priest, chief hafuri, etc. proceed directly to the prayer recitation hall (however, the manner of seating and distinctions between inner and outer observation areas are as usual).

Next, the two assistant officials rise and prepare the outer sanctuary offerings. In this procedure, the assistant hafuri (serving in the senior role), rotating offerers (five people), chief administrator, etc. advance in rotation, and the food preparation officials present the offerings. The shrine attendants' advance guard, musicians' performance, rice offerings and other sacred items below, and each advance and retreat, etc. are as in every sacred ceremony. However, although the deputy holds pine torches in the outer sanctuary, when presenting sacred paper candles, the senior official takes them, ascends beside the western stairs, and positions behind the candle stand. After completion, these are removed. The procedure is the same as before. After all preparations and presentations are completed, each returns to their seat (however, for the rotating offerers, their seating area this time is near the assistant shrine, below the advantage boards, around the third pillar base of the board fence).

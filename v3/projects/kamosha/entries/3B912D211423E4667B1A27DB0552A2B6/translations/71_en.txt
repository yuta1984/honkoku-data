The sacred doors are closed at the great platform《with musical accompaniment, below as before. However, the chief priest, after one bow, waits at the base of the Hafuri worship pillar and prostrates as usual》. Next, the sacred lock wrapping is advanced in preparation《oak and white wooden branches are advanced at this time》《exchanged with the sacred key》. The Hafuri receives this, finishes wrapping it, and after one bow withdraws, with each shrine official returning to their seats in the earthen building《especially the five officials and below, the two Wakamiya officials proceed from Wakamiya to Suwa Shrine in pilgrimage and arrive at the earthen building. However, first at the shrine grounds, they still wait to see the shrine officials of Ōta clan gods and others descend to the earthen building》.

The chief priest, Hafuri, and ritual abstainer take their seats under the southern eaves of the細殿 (narrow hall)《however, this is east of the steps. The chief priest to the west, ritual abstainer in the center, Hafuri to the east, each facing south seated on round cushions》. Next, the deputy administrator has the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of rice varieties appropriate for the current year divined, brings that divination document, and has the chief priest, Hafuri, and others examine it. During this time, the deputy administrator kneels in the center.

《The procedure is that the deputy administrator prepares the rice variety divination document in advance and has divine servants take it to the Bureau of Divination. Therefore, the diviner divines the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of rice varieties and marks the rice varieties appropriate for the current year with vermillion dots. Either all three or two types are marked among white rice, black rice, and red rice. This varies by year. Before the appointed time on the day, divine servants come to receive it and deliver it to the deputy administrator. Regarding this, from around the 26th day in advance, the deputy administrator sends inquiries to the chief priest, Hafuri, and others about whether there are any discrepancies in rank signatures and names. In recent times, this procedure is omitted, and the cover writing of the sacred register is recorded in the divination document》

After examination, it is returned to the deputy administrator《the procedure is that first the chief priest takes it, removes the cover and ceremonial papers, finishes examining it, wraps it as before and returns it to the deputy administrator. Next, the Hafuri does the same, finishes examining it and returns it to the deputy administrator. At this time, the chief priest states that "the rice varieties appropriate for the current year should be communicated to subordinate officials"》.

Next, the divination master comes out and at Nijima-i, purifies and cleanses the rice varieties at the western cut grass area, then divides one pair of round hemp into two, one each, places them upright on the left and right rice varieties, and withdraws《however, previously at this time, divine servants bring two bundles of rice varieties《however, one bundle contains ten sheaves, originally said to be 75 stalks each》. This is set up south of the two torii, on the cut grass, north of the temporary shrine grounds, arranged north-south or east-west. Also, two bamboo bows and arrows made with paper tips are placed leaning in front of the left and right rice varieties. The right bowstring is thin rope. The arrows are made of dwarf bamboo, about 2.5 feet long. Also, about 4 inches high above the left and right rice varieties, spanning across, one winnowing basket is made and loaded. This is made of straw, especially with handles wrapped in paper. Inside this, one sheet of half-paper is folded in two and spread, and a small amount of washed rice and one set of bird food is placed. The矢刀祢 (Yatone) prepares this. The bird food is 1.2 升 of gold-wrapped grain, obtained from the administrators. Also, of the two bundles of rice varieties, one bundle is from the御戸代田 (Mitoyo-da field), especially brought by the chief priest's associates and delivered to the Yatone. One bundle comes from the茶木原 (Chakihara) field territory of the late Kaneshina family. Now it comes from the Nagabuke area of Kanenori family territory. Both bundles of rice become the Yatone's ceremonial feast》

The chief priest and Hafuri rise and exit through the two torii, proceed to the front of the rice varieties, first perform shoe removal bow and sit down with sitting bow《chief priest to the north, Hafuri to the south, each facing south, with one tatami mat prepared. However, this is omitted during rain ceremonies》. Next, they take up bow and arrows to shoot and purify the rice varieties《the procedure is to take up two bows, first the chief priest shoots the first arrow, Hafuri the second arrow, releasing two arrows each in total. Next, the Hafuri shoots the first arrow, and the chief priest shoots the final arrow》.

After finishing, the bows are placed in their original location, they perform sitting bow and shoe removal bow, and return to their original seats. Next, three divine servants bring handling chopsticks and deliver them to the chief priest, Hafuri, ritual abstainer, and others《these handling chopsticks are made of dwarf bamboo, one pair each, with the base end bound with twisted paper. The Yatone prepares them. For paper, five sheets of half-paper are delivered from the administrator to the Yatone. Of these, three sheets are for the chief priest, Hafuri, and ritual abstainer, and two sheets are for the arrows and to be spread in the arrow field》.

Also, they bring three ears each of the rice varieties that were shot《however, now this is abbreviated, and three ears each are set aside in advance and brought》. At this time, the chief priest, Hafuri, and ritual abstainer use the handling chopsticks to handle and drop them, receiving them with paper《the procedure is that first the three divine servants alternately bring three ears of rice each, first bringing them before the chief priest. At this time they handle and drop them. Next the ritual abstainer, then the Hafuri. Now it is the chief priest, Hafuri, and ritual abstainer. The procedure is the same as before. However, there are three divine servants, and these three people take turns once each. Therefore, combining the three people's portions makes nine times total》.

Each finishes wrapping and delivers to the divine servants《however, the base end of the handling chopsticks is placed inside the paper and wrapped together, having the divine servants hold the portions for the chief priest, Hafuri, ritual abstainer, and others in one place. Especially of the three divine servants, two withdraw first and one remains》

They enter from the sake hall bridge, pass through the first and second torii gates and cross the camphor bridge {{Note: However, at the camphor bridge on dark nights, especially during groom duties, they go via the assistant head priest's plank bridge}}. At this time, in front of the tower gate, the inspector
takes the left rear rope {{Note: However, regarding the inspector, after the offering ceremony concludes, since the divine offerings from the outer sanctuary are present at the shrine head, they are summoned and this is handed over}}. Leading across the jewel bridge, presenting to Kataoka Shrine, and finishing,
passing through the connecting hall and from the New Shrine imperial gate {{Note: However, at this time there is a brief delay, awaiting the urging of the shrine priests from the inner sanctuary}} leading into the Chinese-style gate, where at the western eaves the two horse leaders
receive it {{Note: However, the senior takes the left rear rope, and the junior takes the right bridle. Nevertheless, now mostly the bridle is taken by the master teacher and companions, so the junior takes the right rear rope}}.

　The aforementioned sacred rice consists of about five cups of washed rice placed in a serving tray, brought out by the head priest. Therefore, beforehand the companions bring this and
　place it in the eastern area inside the Chinese-style door. At this time it is handed to the feeding attendant. At this time, while placed on the serving tray, it is given to the white horse, and then removed.
The affair concludes and they withdraw, leading the white horse down to the middle gate.
　Most importantly, in front of the Chinese-style door, the clan member of the horse leaders hands the rear rope to the inspector, arriving at the north eaves of the tower gate, where the inspector

　hands it to the master teacher. At this time the horse leaders and inspector offer one bow to the stable administrator and remain at the shrine head. When the sacred horse is an old
　horse, during dark nights when the middle gate stairs and stone platforms are dangerous, they exit through the side door via the center of the provisional hall through the sun

exiting the tower gate and handing it over, along with the assistant head priest's plank bridge, etc., passing from the second torii via Nara bridge and the third torii, leading into

The seven shrine officials rise and proceed toward the entrance of their respective shrines, making ritual visits to each shrine as customary, preparing the divine offerings for the inner and outer sanctuaries.
　The procedure first involves both officials' rotation of offerings {{Note: However, for the rotation of offerings, Kataoka and Wakamiya are served by those on duty, while New Shrine, Ota, Nara, Sawada, and the clan deity shrine are served by purification leaders. From the first leader to the fifth leader, serving in rotation as customary}}

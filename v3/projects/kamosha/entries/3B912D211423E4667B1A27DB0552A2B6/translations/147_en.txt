(Facing east, Kei says, perhaps an error for west) Next the left official rises (about the south center of the ground-taking circle), and for the sumo matches (starting with the leftmost and rightmost first) each bout the official declares the winner (by raising a fan). Ten bouts (this is five persons per side, but is it five matches? Nevertheless, the same person fights twice each, and depending on the outcome there may be three-bout matches, ending when both sides are finished). When the matches conclude, the sumo wrestlers withdraw (the Suetoshi Record says there should be stipend distribution - is this an omission?). Next, the sword-bearer and other officials withdraw.

However, regarding the assistant head priest's ground-taking and document inspection duties, in case of rain these are performed at the bridge hall carriage approach [written in red]

Next, the head priest and others rise from the earthen building, make pilgrimage rounds from Iwamoto shrine to Nara shrine, and take their seats at the office hall (the seating arrangement and manner of sitting follows the usual distinctions between shrine maidens and ritualists). The shrine officials and clan members prepare the deity offerings and communion meal with first chopsticks (two sets), sacred rice (inner and outer sanctuary portions served in triple earthenware, but the three offices serve in crescent shape), sacred vegetables (two cuts of needlefish placed in small earthenware), etc., arranged and stored on the food tables. Next, each takes their seat and the inner sanctuary deity offerings are presented (knife-bearers place them in the sacred chest and present them).

The items are: carp (one throat), bird (one), sea bream (one), ray (eight pieces). For the head priest's communion meal, following this precedent, shrine attendants bring them to the head priest's residence. First for the head ritualist, the items are the same as the head priest's, but in the order of seat presentation: from head shrine maiden to Kataoka shrine maiden, sea bream (two throats) and ray (eight pieces) each; from Kataoka shrine maiden to clan deity ritualists, each shrine's deity offerings are divided in two for communion meals as usual. All from the head ritualist downward are presented at their seats. Next, the outer sanctuary evening offerings are presented (the items are: one set of sacred chopsticks, one cup of sacred rice served in triple portions, two cuts of needlefish placed in earthenware, this portion placed on the food table).

After presenting these, the sacred chopsticks are announced (as usual). Next, small implements are presented (morning and evening outer sanctuary offerings placed together on a tray and presented as usual). Next, sacred confections are presented.

(The minor assistant presents these as usual) Next, serving stands (shizue) are presented (the minor deputy presents these as usual). Next, the announcement of offerings being presented follows in order, and the head priest and others withdraw.

First, the assistant senior official, abstinence children, deputies (two pieces each), twenty-one knife-bearers (thirteen pieces), shrine attendants (two pieces), etc. receive ray communion meals as usual (distributed by the deputy senior official, see New Year's Day for details).

First, the left and right officials and sumo wrestlers (under the offering hall eaves or in the corridors) receive the outer sanctuary deity offerings (the Mori Renkyu Record says today the shrine office communion meal day offerings are distributed to the left and right sumo wrestlers as rewards for sumo).

10th Day
Today at the office building there is a feast ceremony for shrine families aged sixteen and above. The knife-bearers (the upper twenty-one, excluding those with impediments, cooking rice with new grain) prepare this (the time limit is past the noon hour, striking the temple bell for urging). The deputy senior official and deputy senior official each supervise this in purification robes (for this meal rice: one to of judgment rice per deputy portion, plus five portions for those outside my name).

However, the twenty-one shrine official positions receive feast rice in advance from the administrative persons (but around the 8th day: head priest eight shō, from head shrine maiden to clan deity ritualists four shō each, using the gold-handled measuring cup. From the 8th day onward, names are written and people are sent to the meeting place residence to collect them).

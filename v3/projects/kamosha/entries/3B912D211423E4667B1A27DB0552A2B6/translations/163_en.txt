And they wait at the hafuri side customary place. Next, the chief hafuri comes and ascends the great platform, temporarily closing the sacred doors (not yet fastening the sacred locks). At this time, everyone prostrates.

Next, the head priest and below, the five officials withdraw (from the hafuri side), make a small circuit, cross the jewel bridge, enter through the tower middle gate, and at the sacred registry building, each inserts sakaki and day-shade grass into their hair. During this time, the deputy withdraws to stand in the small courtyard and extinguishes the pine torch. Next, shrine officials of the five shrines, Kataoka, Shingu, Wakamiya, Nara, and Sawada (shrine officials of Ōta and clan deities do not participate) take their seats east and west before the deities as initially. Next, the deputy advances to stand in the assistant shrine courtyard and holds the pine torch. Next, the assistant hafuri comes, ascends to the assistant shrine, and opens the sacred doors. At this time, everyone prostrates (previously, shrine officials of the negi side form a line facing north, as initially).

Next, both assistant officials enter the inner sanctuary (advance and retreat as initially). Next, from the Kataoka negi down to the Sawada hafuri, they divide left and right and wait above and below the stairs (specifically, shrine officials beside the stairs wait at the negi side, each in one line). Rotating offerers rise. Next, the sacred curtains are rolled up (the assistant hafuri's duty). Next, inner sanctuary sacred offerings are removed. The procedure is: first, round trays are advanced (three or five trays are used, advanced in sequence). Hafuri side sacred offerings are removed: first salted anchovies, next sacred confections, next layered sacred provisions, next sacred fresh items (removed in five stages), next sacred birds, next sacred carp, next boat rice cakes, next boat rice (the above are removed by the assistant hafuri). Next, the negi side portion from salted anchovies to rice is the same as the hafuri side. Next sacred sake, next sacred chopsticks (the above are removed by the negi) are loaded onto round trays.

(The round trays do not enter the inner sanctuary; shrine officials beside the outer sanctuary sacred doors hold them. At this time, they are loaded from the inner sanctuary and removed in sequence.) These are removed. Next,狛御料 (koma sacred provisions) are removed (first hafuri side, then negi side). After everything is completely removed, scenic objects are stored in the inner sanctuary (stored in left and right plain wood boxes). Next, sacred wiping cloths are advanced (four sheets of half-paper, weights and earthenware as usual). Both officials divide and take them, first lower the sacred curtains and remove the great eight-legged tables (both officials carry by hand). They place them in the original location and wipe them (wiping papers go in the breast). During this time, from the lowest rank (both Sawada officials stand together), they advance below the stairs, bow once, then return to their seats. Next, the assistant negi returns to his seat. Next, the assistant hafuri exits the inner sanctuary, closes the sacred doors, and everyone prostrates. Next, the chief administrator advances the sacred lock wrapping (the procedure is as at the main shrine; in this sequence, the sacred key is passed to the chief administrator). After the assistant hafuri wraps the sacred locks, he returns to his seat. Next, the deputy advances to stand in the small courtyard and holds the pine torch. Next, the chief hafuri rises and ascends to the main hall, opening the sacred doors. Everyone shifts position and prostrates. Next, the head priest and hafuri enter the inner sanctuary. Next, from the chief negi to the Sawada hafuri, they divide left and right and wait above and below the stairs (bowing is as initially; specifically, from the Shingu hafuri down, the negi side forms one line as usual).

Next, rotating offerers advance to the customary place. Next, sacred curtains are rolled up. Next, inner sanctuary sacred offerings are removed. The procedure is the same as at the assistant shrine, so it is abbreviated (specifically, for the negi side the head priest, for the hafuri side the chief hafuri removes them as usual). When completed, the sacred curtains are lowered. Next, rotating offerers return to their seats. From shrine officials of lower rank in order (bowing as usual), each waits at the hafuri side. Next, the head priest exits the inner sanctuary and waits at the hafuri side (customary place). Next, the chief hafuri exits the inner sanctuary.

(These are removed). Next, the left and right koma provisions (first right, then left; the chief and deputy negi remove these as usual). Next, sacred wiping cloths are presented. Next, the sacred curtains are lowered. Next, the rotating offerers return to their seats. Next, starting from the junior attendants (Wakamiya hafuri), they attend the hafuri side in order (bowing and saluting as at the beginning). Next, the head priest exits the inner sanctuary and attends the hafuri side (at the customary place). Next, the hafuri exits the inner sanctuary, closes the sacred doors, and each prostrates themselves. Next, the chief administrator presents the sacred lock wrapping (at this time, the sacred keys are passed to the chief administrator). Next, after the chief hafuri wraps the sacred lock, each withdraws from the hafuri side, makes ritual visits from Wakamiya to Nara Shrine, and arrives at the office building (left and right distinctions as usual).

Next, the evening provisions for the outer sanctuary are offered. The shrine official on duty prepares these as usual (however, if it is nightfall, sacred paper candles are held during the preparation and removal). When this is completed, they arrive at the office building. Next, the shrine officials and clan members hold a feast with the sacred offerings. The items are: two sets of sacred chopsticks, rice (one cup, morning provisions for the outer sanctuary), side dishes (one cup, same as above), three items, boat rice (two portions served in earthenware vessels; however, the three officials receive one boat each. The above refers to the custom where the director takes the inner sanctuary portions from the main shrine and eight subsidiary shrines and divides them into two portions). These are arranged on food trays, and after everyone is seated, the inner sanctuary sacred offerings are distributed.

The items are: carp (one fish), bird (one), sea bream (one piece), ray fish (eight pieces). This portion serves as the head priest's feast as usual. Shrine attendants carry these to their pavilion. First for the chief hafuri, the items are the same as for the head priest. Next, from the chief negi to Kataoka negi: sea bream (two pieces), ray fish (eight pieces), rice cakes (eight pieces). From Kataoka negi to the clan deity hafuri: the sacred offerings of their respective shrines are divided in half for the feast. However, among the seven shrines, boat rice serves as the feast at their seats, and for rice cakes, out of twenty pieces per shrine (four pieces) go to the head priest's feast, so sixteen pieces are divided in half between the two officials for their feast. The above refers to the practice from the chief hafuri to the clan deity hafuri of placing sacred offerings in sacred chests and distributing them at their seats. At this time, shrine officials hold their ceremonial scepters and bow once as usual. Next, rice (one cup) and side dishes (one cup) are distributed (these are the evening provisions for the outer sanctuary). Next, rice cakes are distributed (one decorative rice cake each, served in earthenware vessels).

Next, sacred chopsticks are announced. Next, sacred sweets are distributed (left and right portions from the main shrine are combined, served on wooden plates, and distributed to left and right). Next, small utensil sets are distributed (morning and evening portions distributed to left and right). Next, serving stands (the role of the junior deputy). Next, the completion of distribution is announced. Next, everyone withdraws.

One item: Ray fish feasts as usual for the chief administrator (two pieces), ritual purifiers and deputies (one piece each), sword-bearing attendants (thirteen pieces), shrine attendants (two pieces, one piece each).

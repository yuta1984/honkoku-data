{{Note: It is amusing that shrine officials line up facing north with eastern precedence at the sacred hall to recite prayers. This is not a ceremony for reciting prayers. In ancient times, this was a ceremony where small pines and lantern grass were picked on the Day of the Rat at the sacred hall, wrapped in paper, and carried in procession. This is something the assistant head priest and Kataoka priest should understand}} Clapping hands {{Note: The assembly responds to this. In recent years, there is no hand clapping}} Two bows, then the imperial chests are removed {{Note: The chief administrator and officials take them and hand them to the treasurer}} Next, they pick small pines, each offering prayers, then proceed downward, cross the御生所 bridge, exit the horse grounds, pass in front of the office, and proceed through the second torii to the sun gate {{Note: However, the road shrine attendants announce the procession. These are the above three locations}} They arrive at the seat before the deity {{Note: the transparent corridor on the head priest's side}} The purification leader takes his customary place. Next, the assistant head priest and Kataoka priest take their seats, bow and rise, proceed to the bottom of the stairs, stand in line, perform one bow, and ascend the stairs. They divide left and right and wait at the second level of the stairs. Next, the Shingu priest and Ōta priest divide left and right and wait at the fifth level of the stairs. Next, from the Wakamiya priest to the deputy shrine administrators, they wait at the side of the west stairs {{Note: Each in one line, and their bowing and saluting is the same as the assistant head priest}} Next, the assistant head priest prepares one imperial table on the great platform. Next, small pines and lantern grass are presented from the head priest's side {{Note: The procession is announced, but the head priest or senior head priest (perhaps missing "senior ritual priest") prepares them. Three bundles of lantern grass are placed on small round seats and loaded on round trays}} The assistant head priest takes these and arranges them on the imperial table {{Note: Perhaps missing "on the tray." However, the round trays and small round seats are removed, having been presented twice in Anei 2. First the head priest and senior head priest portion, then the senior ritual priest portion}} When finished, from the deputy shrine administrators to the Shingu priest, they return to their seats {{Note: After proceeding to the bottom of the stairs and performing one bow}} During this time, the chief administrator prepares lantern grass at the temporary shrine {{Note: The lantern grass prepared by the two deputy officials is loaded on round trays and offered. After the assistant head priest finishes reciting prayers (perhaps missing "removes them")}} Next, after the assistant head priest and Kataoka priest descend the stairs and perform one bow, the assistant head priest takes the prayer seat, and the Kataoka priest proceeds to a certain shrine {{Note: Without returning to his seat, he directly descends the transparent corridor}} Next, the priests from Shingu and below rise from their seats and proceed to a certain shrine to offer small pines and lantern grass. With Kataoka taking precedence, one assistant server follows as usual, as in every divine ceremony.

The procedure is: first, the priest and assistant server take seats in the worship hall. At this time, the treasurer brings lantern grass and round trays, but Kataoka and Ōta clan deities do not need to bring round trays, as they are always present at that shrine {{Note: However, the clan deity shrine has no round trays}}. After the preparations are complete, the priest ascends to the great platform and prepares the imperial table on the great platform. Next, the head priest (perhaps missing "ritual priest") portion loads the lantern grass on round trays and the assistant server presents them. The priest takes these and offers them on the imperial table. Next, the assistant server returns to his seat, then the priest returns to his seat and finishes reciting prayers. The priest proceeds to the great platform and removes the round trays, the assistant server receives them and places them in a convenient location or hands them to the treasurer. Next, the priest takes the lantern grass and stands it against the left and right sides of the sacred doors, places the imperial table in its original location, withdraws and bows as usual.

Today there is no seated ceremony, so they make rounds of the roadside shrines at will and withdraw. However, the Kifune portion is placed in the daily offering bitter chest, transported to Kifune, and arranged by all the shrine children.

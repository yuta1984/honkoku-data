　　　　　Hōreki 3rd year, 1st month, 14th day: Attendance at the Sacred Shelf Assembly

First, on the night of the 14th, all preparations are made in order, and there is a sacred visitation announcement {{Note: three times}}, and they proceed {{Note: wearing purified garments and hakama}}. From the Daily Offering Torii {{Note: one bow}} they enter the Second Torii {{Note: putting on shoes, one bow}} and arrive at the Earth Shrine. After the nineteen offices {{Note: Kifune and both officials do not attend}} have assembled, the Director comes to the Earth Shrine and asks "Are you all assembled? Shall we set up the sacred shelves?" {{Note: the head priest responds}}. Next, six sacred shelf legs along with the portable shrines of the three shrines - Kataoka, Shingu, and Wakamiya - are dispatched from the administrative building {{Note: five purification leaders each attend to their respective sacred shelves, with shrine attendants leading the way}}. When passing through the Earth Shrine, each person prostrates. Next, the head priest and others rise in order and proceed to the sacred area. The shrine officials of the seven shrines proceed directly to their respective shrines {{Note: they make pilgrimage visits to each shrine along the route. However, the Sawada shrine official, senior priest, ritual officiant, and crossing ritual officiant face diagonally toward the main shrine at the direction bridge and make one bow, then proceed to Iwamoto Shrine for one bow}}.

{{Note: Proceeding}} First, both officials and offering bearers take their seats and bow {{Note: before this, attendants carrying swords from the administrative building accompany them and arrive at the worship hall. Of course, the sacred offerings for the sacred shelves are courtyard offerings, therefore they have legs. However, there are separate records of the sacred offering items}}. Next, the offering bearers rise and proceed to the courtyard for one bow, and the portable shrines are carried and placed in the courtyard {{Note: the offering bearers and sword attendants perform this role}}. Next, both officials rise and take their seats in the courtyard, first making one bow, or sometimes while seated, then the offering bearers present the ritual offerings to both officials {{Note: however, there are six staffs, divided into two sets of three staffs each}}. Both officials hold these, rise, and make two bows {{Note: when advancing: left-right-left, when retreating: right-left-right}}. They recite the ritual prayers.

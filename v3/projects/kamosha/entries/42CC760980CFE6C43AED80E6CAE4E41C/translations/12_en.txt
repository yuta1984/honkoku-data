Traditional Format Passed Down from Hōbō

At this place, erecting thick shrine pillars, in Takamagahara,
Before the wide presence of the awe-inspiring voice of Kamo Wakeikazuchi no Kami, whose name is too sacred to speak,
As a regular ceremony, on a good day in the fourth month,
With sacred sakaki branches from the deep mountains, the sacred shade of hollyhock, the sacred shade of katsura,
Purifying and decorating, with the Kamo County Chief as
the foundation, naming the men as
"rough men," and naming the women
as "rough women," wearing hemp sashes
across their shoulders, with forehead bands, holding the divine words of the eight moats
of Yamashiro Province, along with leading many villages
together in offering the number of racing horses:

Priests' horses ten horses　Consequently horses ten horses　Chasing horses ten horses　Consequently horses ten horses
Head priests' horses ten horses　Consequently horses ten horses　Chasing horses ten horses　Consequently horses ten horses  
Official horses ten horses　Consequently horses ten horses　Chasing horses ten horses　Consequently horses ten horses

To the extent that blue clouds trail, to where white clouds
lie down, to where the smoke of the people
rises, throughout all the roads,
over five hundred horses, five horses, according to custom, we humbly
serve, and if you peacefully illuminate and govern,
protecting the Emperor's precious throne, firm as eternal rock, as night's guard,
as day's guard, protecting and blessing his reign,
and the civil and military hundred officials, extending throughout the realm, protect the nation
and bless it. We respectfully declare: according to custom,
the racing horses we offer shall not run sideways, shall not
stumble, and the riders, in front protection and rear protection,
please guard and bless them.

1. At the occasion of the yoriai-hajime (first gathering) at the Mokudai's residence, a folded paper worth 500 mon sent from the kasshi group to the Mokudai shall be prepared and brought by the Shoshi in advance.

However, this folded paper is a simple catalog. The paper used is Sugihara paper folded in three, written as "50 hiki for sake barrel fee." While this folded paper should originally be written and recognized by the Shoshidai according to proper protocol, it is now recognized by the Shoshi.

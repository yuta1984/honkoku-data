Since this was the case, if there were no particularly inconvenient or unseemly matters, it was decided to proceed with the appointment.

25th Day Entry

1. The farmers under Ōno jurisdiction came and petitioned as follows: Since orders were given recently, we requested the Ōno water officials to please provide drainage. However, they said that drainage work takes a full day, and given the current difficulties, they petitioned Your Shrine for meal allowances, but were told there was no precedent and it would not be provided. Moreover, the officials do not come out, so there is nothing to be done. Since this concerns the sacred domain, we request that the shrine officials come out as per the main village practice to order drainage so that the remaining fields can be planted. In the evaluation, since this concerns the sacred domain, it cannot simply be ignored. While the Ōno water officials have an improper attitude, planting must be done regardless, so it was decided that about three people from the assembly would take on additional duties, with one person each from the previous four water magistrates joining them to go out and order the drainage. Namely, Awa-no-kami Tomikiyoshi, Bunzen-no-suke Yasumune, and Noto-no-kami Yasushika accepted these additional duties. During recent deliberations, since other domains are intermixed, there was concern about whether it would be appropriate to take care of other domains' affairs if there were many in the remaining fields. Therefore, it was deemed proper to summon the Ōno water officials for inquiry. Immediately, Ike no Rokurōbē came and was questioned. In the Ōno jurisdiction's remaining fields, about 5 chō of unplanted area remains, of which Daitokuji domain amounts to barely about 5 koku, with the rest all being sacred domain. The total assessment is 300 koku, of which about 45 koku are intermixed with other domains. Yasutsu asked Rokurōbē: "Recently drainage orders were given to your group, but why haven't you carried them out? The remaining fields are also sacred domain, and since this is a matter between farmers, if you let water into the upper fields at night and drain it during the day from dawn (6 AM) until evening, planting could be completed. Can't your group handle the drainage?" He replied that if done as instructed, the remaining field portions could be planted in about two and a half to three days. Since we are constantly engaged in drainage work with no time to return home for meals, being completely occupied with the work, we petitioned to receive some meal allowance. Therefore, it was discussed whether, since going out from the assembly for such a small matter would be conspicuous, it would be appropriate to give about 1 kan mon in meal allowance and order them to proceed. Everyone thought this proper, so it was decided accordingly, and the additional duty assignment was canceled.

1. Today a letter arrived from the palace intermediaries Machiguchi Mino-no-kami Takaya and Tōtōmi-no-kami to the shrine officials. Regarding the matter recently communicated, they wish to obtain your opinion, so please come to the inner entrance tomorrow, the 24th. A reply was immediately sent.

1. After today's representative departure, a summons arrived from Lord Hino Ben to the head priest, stating that there is official business and the representatives should come to the residence immediately. This summons was issued before the initially dispatched representative had yet reached Lord Ben. Therefore, this matter was acknowledged and the representative appeared before Lord Ben before the messenger returned.

1. Around the half-hour of the Sheep (around 2:30 PM), someone ran back from Nakajuku to inform the representatives that he was currently resting at Nakajuku but would return shortly, so a meeting should be arranged. Therefore, a meeting was held.
Attendees:

1. Shortly after, representatives Yasushige and Yasuaki returned and reported: When we appeared before Lord Hino Ben, Mizutani Mokku came out and said that a summons had just been sent from here. We wondered if there had been some mistake on the way, and though we had not received the messenger, we explained that regarding the inquiry submitted yesterday, given the current circumstances, we had come to make the inquiry. We were told to wait while it would be reported. After a while, he came out and said: "Yesterday's submitted inquiry document has not been taken up. In any case, this concerns something granted from here, and there are no obstacles from our side. In the acknowledgment document submitted recently, it was written that the grant was received with no interference from any quarter, so such inquiries are inappropriate." Therefore, this matter was said to interfere with the shrine community...

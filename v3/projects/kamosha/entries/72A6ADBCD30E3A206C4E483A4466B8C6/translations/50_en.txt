Since we have submitted a petition for exemption from our village, we cannot distribute water to other villages during the specified period, so we must decline. The above　　　　　　　　　　　Koyama Village

Since Koyama Village does not agree as stated above, based on the ancient precedent of the nyōbō gobunshō (court ladies' documents), it should be granted through official channels from the densō (imperial messenger). With Koyama Village's current stance, it will be difficult to uphold the superior's command and maintain the shrine's dignity, so it would be appropriate to consult the densō about this matter. However, if Koyama Village has legitimate objections to the water allocation, they would not have submitted such a written statement. First, we should privately seek the opinion of the intermediary officials about this situation. If they say that this might be a misunderstanding by the farmers and that they will conduct a proper investigation, so we should postpone consulting the densō, then we should accept that and return. But if the intermediary's response is unsatisfactory, we should tell them that if this is the case, it will be difficult to uphold the superior's command, so we have no choice but to consult the densō, and then proceed directly to consult the densō. After various deliberations, it seems best to first consult the densō. If consulting only with the intermediaries yields no resolution, we should subsequently consult the densō. Or even if we appeal to the intermediaries, since ultimately the intermediary and the imperial garden administrator are one and the same, and this concerns Koyama Village's jurisdiction, it would be futile. In any case, since commands issued by the densō cannot be easily dismissed, it would be appropriate to consult about this matter. Since no decision was reached and Miyauchi Yasutoshi was absent due to a toothache, and since this is a serious matter, Yasudo suggested that we should seek His thoughts and opinions. Yasudo then went to Yasutoshi's residence.

When Yasudo visited and consulted with Yasutoshi about the above matter, Yasutoshi's opinion also aligned with the initial deliberation: they should prepare a petition to the imperial messenger, along with documents from Kyōhō 12, 5th month when Koyama Village petitioned the shrine, the shrine's petition to Lord Manrikōji Ben, extracts from shrine records, and letters of authorization from the intermediaries to the shrine officials. They should first seek the opinion of the intermediaries, and if they agree to postpone consulting the densō for now, they should accept that and return. But if no resolution is reached, they should proceed directly to consult the densō. When this was reported back to the assembly, everyone agreed this was the proper course. Accordingly, the representatives from the council meeting - Kubo Yasudo as chief delegate, plus one other person appointed as liaison, Kunishi - a total of three people would go. First, they went to the samurai entrance of the imperial palace and requested an audience. The messenger on duty, Ukon Nobutoshi, came out, so they presented their credentials and requested to speak with the intermediary officials. Word was sent, and soon the intermediary on duty, Kosaji Mikawa-no-kami, appeared. Yasudo addressed him: "We are grateful that you have graciously met with us despite your busy schedule. The matter we wish to discuss is not extraordinary. Due to the current drought, we recently received a grant of water from the imperial pond, which we were told to distribute to the farmers in the shrine territory for planting. However, the farmers of Koyama Village say that they have already received the water allocation from the 18th to the 25th of last month, so they cannot comply. Is this indeed the case? Since these are people of humble status, it's possible they have misunderstood some minor reduction in the regular water supply as a special water grant. We inquire about this privately. If this is indeed the case, then since the densō has ordered the water allocation, it would be difficult to uphold the superior's command, so we may have no choice but to consult the densō. If we leave a situation where the superior's command cannot be upheld as it is, we might face criticism later, which troubles us greatly. In any case, regarding the farmers' understanding..."

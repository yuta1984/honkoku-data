There is no such thing. Regarding the matter that the farmers petitioned and received as a grant, the shrine community was not aware of it. Moreover, according to precedent, the farmers consulted with the shrine community, and the shrine community made the petition, so there should be no interference. While the public grant has been completed, since there is no water to actually receive the grant as specified, we made this inquiry. Despite engaging in back-and-forth five or six times, the responses were unreasonable no matter how many times we appealed - like pushing against a shop curtain - so we decided to return first and inform the shrine community, then consult and perhaps make another appearance later. The deliberations covered various matters, and since this involves internal palace affairs, there may be irregularities making investigation difficult. In that case, insisting on the petition might actually be inappropriate, so it would be better to abandon this water request and henceforth make petitions that would establish the shrine's proper status. Since tonight is too late to prepare a petition document, an early appearance tomorrow morning would be appropriate. Moreover, since a letter arrived from the intermediaries today, it would be good to visit them as well while there. It was decided that three people should appear, with one person being Mikawa-no-kami taking on additional duties and jurisdiction. Therefore, Yasushige drafted the petition document and submitted it early. Later, Yasutsu made arrangements and completed it, then passed it to the scribe.

24th Day, Year of the Rooster, Clear Weather

1. Around the half-hour of the Rabbit (around 6:30 AM), we appeared at the council chamber. Since there were some discrepancies in the petition document the scribe had prepared last night, we sent for the scribe to rewrite it. Representatives Naruhisa, Suenori, and Yasushi appeared. When we appeared before Lord Hino Ben and made our presentation, Mizutani Mokku came out, so we made our oral presentation and submitted the petition document. We were told they would make their presentation and to temporarily withdraw to Nakajuku. Therefore, on our way back, we visited the palace samurai entrance and requested an audience. Terasawa Ichinoshin came out and conveyed the message. The intermediaries had not yet begun their duties. According to Ichinoshin's account, various people had been coming and going recently.

Soon after, Iimuro Iga-no-kami came out, bringing the documents submitted previously, saying that yesterday he had obtained your opinion by letter and wished to return these documents and obtain your opinion. This matter follows the established annual protocol that he had been familiar with for twenty years. Whether there are guests present, or especially when the pond is experiencing drought, we always communicate from our side to each of your parties. Such matters are occasional and not frequent. This will continue to be so henceforth. Regarding water matters, we hear they are somehow complicated, but other matters are beyond our knowledge. Therefore, we requested that henceforth, regarding official water use regardless of quantity, your parties should communicate directly to the shrine community. We informed them that henceforth we would not deal with water requests from Koyama farmers, so please keep this in mind. He replied that he understood completely in detail, then withdrew. We then went to Nakajuku to wait. Before the hour of the Sheep, a summons arrived from Lord Hino Ben, so we immediately appeared. Mizutani Mokku came out and announced that the petition had been reviewed by the Imperial messenger, but both Their Lordships found its intent difficult to understand. The petition document should be returned immediately, but due to tonight's sacred music performance at the Inner Palace requiring much attention, it would be reviewed once more and returned tomorrow. The intent of the previous document was also found difficult to understand. The representatives stated that if this petition is not accepted, the ancient shrine status cannot be maintained, which is lamentable. We will appear again tomorrow for the petition and requested favorable consideration. We then appeared before Imperial Messenger Lord Hamuro, reported these matters, and returned home. At Nakajuku, Mikawa-no-kami and Harima-no-kami consulted and decided this matter cannot be left as is, so they should return and promptly convene a meeting.

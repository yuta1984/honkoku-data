If Koyama Village continues to make such claims, it will be difficult to uphold the densō's commands, and gradually the ancient shrine status will be lost, which deeply concerns our entire shrine administration. If the commands recently issued also become impossible to implement, it will cause extreme distress to our entire shrine administration. If we leave matters as they are, we fear it would be even more improper, so we humbly inquire how this should be handled. We respectfully request your favorable judgment on these matters. The above.

Today's water duty was from the Hour of the Horse to the Hour of the Cock, with the sixth group, and Moriaaki Yasutoshi was on duty. Therefore, we declined the meeting from noon, but since there were consultation matters today and the location was nearby, we asked the duty partner to take care of things and continue the watch. If both of you have consultation duties, please inform the council chamber. With this understanding, we entrusted this matter to Haruaaki in place of Moriaaki, and he acknowledged it. From around the Hour of the Monkey, Yasutoshi went out on duty, so we temporarily sent Aizuru Dayū as a substitute. The location was at the middle Mizoguchi, so it was at Iwachiyo Dayū's gate.

This evening, while Yasutoshi and others were out on duty, it rained in the back mountains and the river water suddenly rose. Therefore, through consultation between water magistrate Mikawa-no-kami Suemichi and Buzen-no-kami Yasusato, they requested the meeting office to withdraw the water watch and summoned the junior officials to issue instructions. Immediately, the water officials went to report to Mikawa-no-kami: "The water appears to have risen, but since [unclear] above, water is not flowing down at all to the back of the main road, let alone near Rokuchō Bridge. We would like to maintain the watch at the channels and wait for the water to flow down." Upon this report, the junior officials were again summoned and instructed to continue the water watch.

23rd day, Year of the Monkey, clear weather
Today's meeting concerns the water matter. In attendance: Head Priest Masahisa, Yasuteru, Naruhisa.
Yesterday when three people attended, Yasutoshi gave a good speech: "This matter involves allocation quickly granted due to drought, and it would not be proper to handle the inquiry matter leisurely. It would be appropriate to attend for the inquiry before Lord Ben summons us." It was decided unanimously, and therefore representatives Naruhisa and Yasusato attended. After Naruhisa returned to prepare, he declined to attend due to stomach pain, so Yasuteru suddenly attended instead.

Yesterday's unexpected rain in the back mountains that increased the water was a response to prayers for rain, so it would be appropriate to first offer sake as a dedication. Everyone thought this was quite proper, so immediate instructions were given to the meeting office to dedicate sake, with the shrine compound duty officer making the offering.

The festival account books were submitted by the annual duty officers and read by the scribe.
A person named Uemon from Nakamura Village came to make a report (mentioned previously).
Kaga-no-kami Michikiyo requested to offer one thunder-protection amulet. This was approved.
Colleague Ichibei petitioned: "We understand that the two mortar woods in the council chamber are no longer useful and there has been a decision to designate them as split wood. If so, we would offer about two loads of dried pine split wood, and we would like to receive those mortar woods." This was granted as requested.

Minor attendant Kihachi petitioned: "Previously I requested leave, and when searching for a replacement, the son of Anemon from Jūrakuji Temple wishes to apply. When I spoke with Anemon directly, he said that if appointed he would certainly perform the duties, but since he is an inexperienced person, he finds it difficult to apply on his own behalf, so please kindly appoint him." The evaluation noted that he is a young person

Since this was the principle, they firmly refused, saying it was impossible for poor people to manage. However, when it became truly impossible to provide the silver, it would be submitted from Kishu to the magistrate's office, and from the magistrate's office there would be official orders to the shrine. If things developed in such a way, even Kyosen would be in an embarrassing position toward the shrine, and moreover, it was impossible to predict what developments might follow. Therefore, the two village officials Matakichi and Kakuichi came to the shrine again to repeatedly petition, requesting that since it was difficult for all village officials to carry out their duties, through Matsugai's arrangements, a permanent loan of five ryo in gold was granted and handed over. Because of this, they petitioned me again, and unavoidably I informed them that in addition to Sanjuro's residence, I would give them one plot of Chakihara paddy field. They said this was grateful, but given the current times, especially regarding silver to be procured tomorrow, they requested compassionate consideration in gold form, but I refused, saying there was no room for compromise. Then, stating the matter of these two people's borrowing, I heard that unavoidably two ryo in gold would be lent. Furthermore, Sado-no-kami Tsunemasu, through an intermediary, made inquiries about borrowing two ryo in gold, and finally five ryo in gold was properly given to both Matakichi and Kakuichi. This was, of course, an intermediary loan from within the official funds held in trust by Ichijo-dono. The said gold was handed over to Sado-no-kami, and the receipt was handed over through him as intermediary. Regarding repayment: if the principal is fully paid by the coming September 30th, no interest would be required; if three ryo are returned within that same day and the remaining two ryo are returned by the end of November, then from this August onward, according to regulations, interest of one and a half bu per month would be established. With this agreement, the matter was settled and concluded.

25th day, Kanoe-uma, clear. Today was the auspicious satogaeri (return to parents' home) of Hoshino Mie. This morning she went to the Horikawa house by palanquin, and from there walked for about the hour of the Sheep (1-3 PM). Accompanying her were Shui's daughter Tomi (age 7), one maidservant, two manservants, carrying luggage with shoulder poles. Mie, Tomi, the maidservant and others stayed over. To the two manservants were given celebratory sake, ceremonial celebration money of 300 mon, and two folded sheets of half-paper each.

For Mie's satogaeri, congratulatory gifts arrived from the Hoshino family: several dried bonito fish and 150 toshi-manchu. Previously, through the matchmaker Horikawa Jukoin...

Regarding this matter, he has succeeded as adopted son to Fujiki Echigo Toshiaki's house, therefore we submit this notification.
Sheep Year, 8th Month, 6th Day - Kondo Hizen-no-kami Tsunekazu
However, notification from Toshiaki's side was also completed yesterday on the 5th day, as rumored by the matchmaker Seisan.

○ As the annual religious sect inspection approaches, the matter of the above adoption succession was also reported to the Young Lord's representative today and completed.

○ In the afternoon, Tsunehiro went to bid farewell to the residences of Tsunetada, Tsunetake, Teisei, Hitsuaki, Seisan, Koho and others, as he will be moving soon.

7th Day, Mizunoto-I: Clear. As Tsunehiro was to move to Toshiaki's house tomorrow, due to directional concerns, from this afternoon he was sent to stay one night at Kawabata Mikumo Chusho's temporary residence for directional avoidance.

8th Day, Kinoe-Ne: Clear weather. Visited the residence of Nijo family retainer Matsunami Gagaku-no-kami. Regarding Tsunehiro's succession to the Fujiki family this time, there have been various arrangements both internal and external since the past days, so he offered greetings and sent one set of woven shoulder garment fabric. Next, he visited Fujiki Inaba-no-suke's temporary residence, offered the same greetings, and sent five dried bonito and one set of woven shoulder garment fabric, etc.

○ Today being an auspicious day, Tsunehiro auspiciously moved to Toshiaki's house. Therefore, luggage was transported in the morning, and in the afternoon I accompanied Tsuneki, taking along attendant samurai Yanaya Jubei and Shimogori Kameshiro, and headed to Kawabata Mikumo's place. There they changed clothes - each wearing flower-colored katabira and hemp formal wear, while the samurai wore haori and hakama. Immediately taking Tsunehiro along, they arrived at Toshiaki's residence in Teramachi Imadegawa Kamimachi.

Earlier, the introducer Seisan was waiting at the same place. Therefore, today's gifts were presented to him. The inventory is as follows, with each item wrapped in medium paper with white and red long mizuhiki cords:

Fans - one box
Dried bonito - one string

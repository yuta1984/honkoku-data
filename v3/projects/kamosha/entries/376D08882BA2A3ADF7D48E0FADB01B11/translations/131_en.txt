Negotiations continued step by step, and today was the satogaeri (bride's return to her parents' home), with the groom's formal entry on the coming 28th day. Shui made his first visit, and it was also agreed that Kyoko would make her first visit to the Hoshino family within the 2nd or 3rd of next month.

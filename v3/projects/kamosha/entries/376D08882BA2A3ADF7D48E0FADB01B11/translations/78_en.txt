The attendant role was performed by Keiki. ○ Keikan came and attended the shrine. ○ Today's festival転供祝方 (shrine offering rotation) was the second rank. For direct attendance, he arranged his hair in hiramoyori style, took a purifying bath, and after the hour of the monkey (申刻), when the third drum was beaten, he donned court dress with a simple cap decorated with sacred sakaki branches and shadow vines, accompanied by one minor official, one attendant, and Kameshiro with his son for service. He reported to the bathhouse officials and general administrators, then proceeded from the third torii through the second torii, Negi Bridge, Tama Bridge, tower gate, and middle gate to ascend to the banquet hall. At the second torii, he put on his shoes and made one bow at the wayside shrine. At the hour of the cock (酉刻), the sacred ritual began. After observing the shrine officials' procession, he proceeded to the celebrant area. Shortly after taking his seat, the sacred doors opened and divine offerings were presented on both sides as usual. After the outer sanctuary offerings were prepared and presented by the Negi officials, the doors of the pillar hall were opened again and divine offerings presented on both sides, also as usual. At this time, the celebrants rotated the offerings, proceeding to the eastern sliding boards of the main shrine to perform their duties. After completion, they made the shrine rounds. The first celebrant Ekiken and second Kesen proceeded to Kataoka Shrine, where Negi Keikyu and celebrant Masanao also attended directly. The sacred doors opened and inner and outer divine offerings were presented as usual. However, in the inner sanctuary, in addition to the usual sacred containers and offerings, there was what was called "the offering of forty-two" - forty-two small horse mackerel placed in small sacred containers. The rest was like the subsidiary shrines, with courtyard offerings, sacred wrapped packages, and other ritual duties performed as usual. After the head celebrant Ekiken completed his duties, they exchanged greetings and withdrew. Around the hour before the boar (亥前刻), Imperial Messenger Lord Atago Chujo and below, dancers and attendants each arrived, with Aoki Shinano and Koji among the attendants. By the hour before the rat (子前刻), all matters were completed as usual and the imperial withdrawal took place. Most auspicious indeed.

Thirteenth day, Mizunoe-inu (壬戌), clear. Horikawa Omi-no-kami Butsugi has been suffering from mental illness since last year, so arrangements were made through the mediation of Namba Iyo-no-kami Tsunenari for the adoption and succession of Urano Yasuyasu's second son Kotaro, age seven. Today, the adoption petition was submitted through the same family's Horikawa Danjojo. However, this succession was officially presented as being appointed by the will of the palace. The actual son of Omi-no-kami was already discussed with Shingu Ryotei through Kesen's prior negotiations.

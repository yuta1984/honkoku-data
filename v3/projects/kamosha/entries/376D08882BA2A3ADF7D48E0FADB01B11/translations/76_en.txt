Third day, Mizunoe-mi (壬巳), clear. The purification robe lottery and the banquet for the middle return ceremony were held as usual at Koshuku Kiubōtei. I gathered early in the morning and everything was completed as usual. ○ After the midday meal, the special festival distribution was made at Wakayaku Seigyo-tei, and I received 49 monme 9 fun 5 rin in silver per person. Due to the high rice prices this year, the offering money was decided at 500 mon each for this year only, and was distributed immediately as usual.

Fifteenth day, Kinoe-uma (甲午), cloudy, rain in the afternoon. Seo Yahei's wife Chiyo had been suffering from apoplexy in recent years, but it recurred recently, and her condition has been very poor lately. I sent a container of five kinds of simmered and dyed foods as a visit, but was informed by the same family's Jibei that she passed away last night despite care. The formal announcement will be on the coming 18th, with the funeral at Hōon-ji temple at the hitsuji hour on the 19th.

Sixteenth day, Kinoto-hitsuji (乙未), clear, rain in the evening. I visited the Seo Yahei household for condolence. Although there has been no formal announcement yet, since it constitutes ritual defilement, I visited today and had an attendant deliver one barrel of five shō of sake.

Nineteenth day, Tsuchinoe-inu (戊戌), clear. For the funeral at the temple gate at the hitsuji hour at the Seo Yahei household, I sent Aoki Hikobei from the palace group as my representative. He took along one lantern bearer and performed the farewell incense offering and other duties.

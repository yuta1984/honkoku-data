All lidded containers and such were washed and set aside.

24th day, Tsuchinoe-inu, clear. The day of thanksgiving prayers. ○Early morning: let down hair, bathed in water. Due to being busy with administrative duties, performed purification with only sprinkling of bamboo leaf water. Living quarters and various implements were purified as usual with sake and bamboo leaves, then departed the hall. All wore hemp formal dress around noon.

From the administrative office, regarding today's end of mourning, restoration to office, and court attendance, the courtiers were summoned and informed through the non-chamberlain. Immediately attended court to express gratitude, then visited the retired emperor, Omiya Palace, the quasi-empress, and others. All expressed joy and were given celebratory sake and delicacies.

25th day, Kinoto-i, intermittently clear. Today is the first daily visit to Kifune Shrine. Though Tsunekazu should have been brought along for service, due to ritual defilement ending in a few days, [I] refrained and postponed, requesting substitute service from Teisei. ○Regarding the lantern lecture duties, when [I] discussed with Hissaken, since both Hissaken and I are very busy with Kyoto duties, today [I] sent a declining message through Hissukubi to Shokuchu Kinjiki.

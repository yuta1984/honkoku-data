They were sent with the message that they were being provided. Although I declined firmly, since today's accounting was also completed, I received the money as is.

25th day, Kanoto-Hitsuji, clear weather. Visit to Tōfuku-ji Temple, from the hour of the Rabbit ■ to half past the hour of the Snake. Third seventh day memorial. There was an ill person among the close attendants, and due to lack of personnel, I accompanied the visit.

27th day, Mizunoto-Tori, cloudy. Afternoon evening shower with several thunder sounds. Condolence letters arrived from three parties in Kantō: the Shogun, the Inner Minister, and the Great Counselor. Today, representatives were summoned from the attached warrior families, and Shimohashi Yamato-no-suke went as a representative to receive them. However, due to the period of defilement, guidance was provided outside the gate, but it was deemed acceptable to proceed, and they were delivered by the public officials without delay, etc. The copies of the formal letters are as follows:

Regarding the death of Ichijō Quasi-Empress, this has been heard. The Great Counselor equally grieves over this matter. According to His will, this message should be conveyed. The above matter should be reported with reverence. With fear and respect.

The formal letter from the Inner Minister has the same wording, except that the two characters "御意" (His will) are written as "御諚" (His command). This is the only difference.

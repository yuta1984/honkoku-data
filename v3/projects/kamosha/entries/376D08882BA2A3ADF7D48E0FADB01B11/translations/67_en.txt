Twenty-fourth day, Hinoe-ne (丙子), clear weather. During the special exhibition at Tōfuku-ji Temple, Murata and I went early in the morning to inspect it, and it rained in the afternoon.

Twenty-fifth day, Hinoto-ushi (丁丑), rain. The special exhibition at Tōfuku-ji Temple concluded today after fifty days. ○ There was thunder at the hour of the Sheep (hitsuji, around 1-3 PM).

Twenty-sixth day, Tsuchinoe-tora (戊寅), clear weather. O-Yachiyo-dono, a junior court lady (ko-jōrō) attached to the women's quarters of the Western Citadel in Kantō, has been promoted to senior court lady and elderly attendant (ō-jōrō o-toshiyori), as was announced. Also, there was a name change to Uta-machi, etc. In connection with this, prayers for freedom from disasters and for increased military fortune and longevity were requested by Chiura, and one hundred hiki of gold came as an initial offering. Accordingly, I prepared twenty-one seats of hemp offerings, visited the shrine in the afternoon after purification, and offered sacred sake and gold. The shrine visit proceeded as usual, with a sequential visit to Kataoka Shrine completed, and sacred sake offerings were prepared by Keisen at the same shrine. Next, ascending to the shrine grounds, there was a prayer request for a specific wish, so I immediately applied to offer sacred sake to the attendants and requested preparations. I took one item from the shelf of the western offering hall and went to the offering hall. The hemp that had been previously placed at the pillar in front of Tanao Shrine was brought along. First, I opened the central door of the offering hall, entered, and made one bow, placing the hemp on the second western table. I arranged the white wooden eight-legged stand that was in the northwest direction opposite the high table, offered sacred sake on the right eight-legged stand using the usual sacred tray, and also prepared the initial offering on the sacred tray. After completion, I sat in the second western seat, made a bow and two prostrations, first recited prayers for the sacred sake and initial offering, then performed twenty-two seats of Nakatomi purification with hemp, followed by the three types of great purification, completed with two prostrations, seat bow, and scattering of hemp. Next, I removed the sacred sake, initial offering, eight-legged stand, etc., and completed the usual bows and prostrations before withdrawing. I ascended to the shrine grounds, returned the sacred tray to its original place, then made the usual sequential visit and offered sacred sake at Ōta Shrine in the worship hall. After returning home, I wrapped the twenty-one hemp seats in small ceremonial paper, wrapped twelve grains of sacred offering rice separately in small ceremonial paper, put both items in a box, instructed the carpenter, and told Yasuko to send them at the next convenient opportunity.

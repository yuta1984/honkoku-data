From the unconscious state, his vital energy gradually drained away, causing everyone to be deeply alarmed. In reality, he entered a critical condition after the hour of the Dog (7-9 PM). Accordingly, a coffin was promptly ordered, made of one-inch thick cypress boards with pine resin applied to the interior. ○For this funeral affair, three men were appointed: Namba Iyo-no-kami, Sasaki Dazai Daikan, and Murata Shikibu Daijō.

Third day, Tsuchinoto-Tori, Clear - Reports on his condition were submitted to the court messengers three times: at the hours of the Dragon, Snake, and mid-Sheep. At the hour of the Monkey (3-5 PM), notice of his death was submitted. Immediately the entire palace was arranged for mourning, with gates left open, felt mats spread at the carriage entrance and other locations, and straw sandals set out. From today, everyone takes turns wearing mourning caps and hemp court dress.
○The schedule determined by Kōtokui for the ceremonies is as follows: secret coffining on the 4th day of the 6th month at the hour of the Dog, formal coffining on the 10th day of the 6th month at the hour of the Dog, and funeral procession on the 15th day of the 6th month at the hour of the Cock.

Fourth day, Kanoe-Inu, Clear - The burial site was determined to be the northern grounds of Teigen-in Temple.
○From yesterday the 3rd until tomorrow the 5th, for three days of court mourning, there was a notice prohibiting musical instruments, as is customary. ○At the hour of the Dog, the secret coffining was completed by all the sixth-rank attendants and personal retainers. The Ōmidokoro, ladies-in-waiting, and all palace officials performed incense offering and paid their respects.
However, the coffin maker Kiguya Heiemon, following precedent, was ordered to make it entirely of cypress with pine resin throughout, but the wood turned out to be pine, and the delivery was delayed until well past the middle of the hour of the Boar - this was extremely inexcusable.

Fifth day, Kanoto-I, Clear - At Tōfuku-ji Temple, Jōsai-dō Sen-shuza was appointed as the officiant for the funeral services. The resident monks and head monks came to pay respects. The posthumous Buddhist name was determined as follows, with the memorial tablet inscribed by Sen-shuza: "Saisho-ji Jun-sangū Zen-Kanpaku Denka Tairei" (Spirit of the Former Regent, Associate of the Third Imperial Prince of Saisho-ji Temple).
○The funeral ceremony will be held at the Dharma Hall with three Buddhist services, and memorial services during the forty-nine-day mourning period will be conducted at Jōraku-an, all arranged according to the precedent of Kansei 7 (1795).
At the same time, it was ordered that Dainagon-sama would rest in the abbot's quarters, and all attendants from high to low would make preparations at the same location, also following the precedent of Kansei 7.

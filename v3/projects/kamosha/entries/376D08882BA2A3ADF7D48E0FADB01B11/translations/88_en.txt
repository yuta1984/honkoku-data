Teissei was additionally appointed and took charge of the duties.

Second Month (Small)

1st day,己酉, Clear - Since last winter, with rice at about 180 monme per koku, many peasants have failed to pay their annual rice tribute. The shrine community has established unified austerity measures from this second month until next year's first month of the Dog year, based on precedent. Accordingly, today there was no drawing of lots for the usual six roles, and duties were performed as before within the fuda-moto council roles.

2nd day, 庚戌, Cloudy - Lord Shigeino-i was appointed as kinshū-tsukai (close attendant messenger) for the Aoi Festival. Normally this would be announced on the 1st day, but due to it being an auspicious day at the Imperial Court, it was announced today. ○In the evening, light rain; around the hour before Inu (7-9 PM), a fire broke out at Murakumo Palace, and it was extinguished around the hour of I (9-11 PM).

5th day, 癸丑 - At the half-hour of U (around 6 AM), thunder rumbled several times; after an evening shower it cleared and the wind was strong. ○The 23rd meeting of the Palace's Hundred-hiki Lecture was held as usual, with Okudaya serving as officer.

7th day, 乙卯, Rain - How the lecture accounting was completed. ○As Yasuda Gyōbu Gon-shōyū, the envoy to Kantō, was to depart tomorrow on the 8th, I visited to offer congratulations and ceremonial sake. However, since Yasuda Ka[?] was a first-time young attendant this year, Fujikake Naizen was appointed as escort for the journey. Accordingly, farewell gifts were sent in advance to Yasuda, Fujikake Kozaburō, and their companion Kihachi. Yasuda received two pairs of tabi socks, while the others received one pair each. ○A message came from Yasufumi that the second son of Inkai Jun'zaburō had died on the 20th of last December. However, since it didn't warrant mourning attire and only a provisional two-day period was required for wearing the senshi garment, and several days had already passed, there was no need for such observances.

11th day, 己未, Clear - Evening shower in the afternoon. For the monthly prayer duty shift, I attended service, and Head Priest Nagatomo, Divine Master Mōchiku, and others attended with all matters proceeding as usual. ○In the early afternoon, there was a meeting for the western-middle accounting. I and Keikei attended, while Keiki did not participate. Due to this year's austerity measures, no meal was served, and one type of side dish was offered upon departure.

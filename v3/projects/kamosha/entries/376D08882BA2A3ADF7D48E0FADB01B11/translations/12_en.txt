6th Day, Kinoto-Ushi: Clear and fine. The second team worked on the storehouse. Three plasterers and seven assistants came.

8th Day, Hinoto-U: Clear. Regarding Kyōki's first visit to the west-central district this year, there had been advance notice that barrel fees would be paid today, so I had someone take one to of sake marked "Ōi-no-dayū" to the lecture hall as the first-visit barrel fee, and a receipt came from the head of the annual officials. From the staff, regarding the formal relocation of the Main Shrine on the coming 15th, Hotate came during the council meeting to report that assistance had been requested from the Senior Secretary of the Bureau of Documents. A short while later, when meeting with Council member Hobō on the way, it was reported that although assistance had been requested earlier, since no one was available, additional council support was ordered instead. Naturally, written instructions on procedures should be provided.

9th Day, Tsuchinoe-Tatsu: Clear. Today I completed the submission for the Planting Festival as usual. Yesterday the 8th there was a notice that from the coming 10th to the 15th, in preparation for the formal relocation on the coming 15th, musical instruments would be prohibited and earthworks should be covered. A notice from the young lord arrived, and I added marks and sent it around. The copy of the notice is as follows:

Twentieth day, Tsuchinoto-i (己亥), snow. This was the ceremonial visit after the end of mourning at the young imperial residence. Keiki participated as an attendant. ○ Yesterday on the 19th, Kinshin from the office came and requested that Keiki take on the fire patrol duties for the special festival. However, due to his attendance duties for the young imperial residence courtyard ceremony, he had to respectfully decline.

Twenty-third day, Mizunoe-tora (壬寅), clear. I had Keiki perform substitute duty for shrine duty and sent night food. However, due to this year's poor harvest, we economized with only two shō of rice, one side dish, and pickles.

Twenty-eighth day, Hinoto-hitsuji (丁未), clear. Regarding the special imperial festival scheduled for the 30th, due to impediments at the imperial palace, a postponement was announced last night, with further announcements to follow.

Last day, Tsuchinoto-tori (己酉), clear. It became cold after the hour of the rat.

December (short month)

First day, Kanoe-inu (庚戌), clear. The year-end cleaning was celebrated as usual. ○ Due to flood damage this year, prices have been rising steadily since October, with one koku now costing 180 monme, causing extreme hardship for farmers. ○ The entire palace staff had been on irregular meal provisions previously, but from this October, after collective deliberation, this was changed to regular rice stipends of two koku per person per year. The stipend distribution from the first day of this October through the last day of next September has been gradually distributed since October, and distribution to everyone has now been completed. However, for this matter, Kessen made particular efforts in planning and calculation.

Third day, Mizunoe-ne (壬子), clear. I requested substitute duty for Keiki's daily attendance rotation.

Fourth day, Mizunoto-ushi (癸丑), clear. The special imperial festival was announced for the coming 11th day.

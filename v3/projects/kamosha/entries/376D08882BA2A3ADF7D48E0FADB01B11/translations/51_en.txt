After reporting to the lower shrine community, he first stopped at Wakasaya, his lodging during his stay in Kyoto, then proceeded to the palace to offer New Year congratulations to both imperial residences, and immediately went to his middle lodging. He brought along his attendant Kameshirō, carrying eboshi court cap, hunting robes, and other items. In the afternoon, he was summoned by the magistrate Bōjō Sasashōben and each person appeared as usual, speaking directly as they wished, and the decree was proclaimed. From there he went to the liaison official and had an audience with Lord Shimizudani Chūnagon, and as usual received the oral decree document directly. Next he went to pay respects at Takatsukasa Palace bridge, and did likewise with magistrate Bōjō. After finishing, he returned home, and at the hour of the rooster (5-7 PM) immediately went to pay respects to the shrine community, still wearing his hemp formal dress. Next he also went to greet the representatives Toshihira, Chōken and others at their residences. The imperial permission was granted without incident - most auspicious and precious.

13th day, Hinoto-tori, clear. The mirror rice cake pounding for the fifth group's shelf ceremony was held at Hitsuyoshi's residence, and I had Keiki attend as my representative, wearing second-rank formal dress. ○ Keikei was supposed to pay respects to the shogunal family last night, but since it was late, he went to the palace this morning to offer thanks to both residences for yesterday's decree. The young lord bestowed three folding fans as New Year gifts.

This is an extremely blessed and grateful fortune. Most precious indeed. ○ Keiki had been ill since October last year but has fully recovered and returned to duty today.

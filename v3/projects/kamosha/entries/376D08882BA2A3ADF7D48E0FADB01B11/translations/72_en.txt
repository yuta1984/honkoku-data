The aforementioned Hōho-agata-nushi had received various kindnesses from our noble house since joining it, and was most accomplished in calligraphy. Following the late Hokō-agata-nushi, both generations had served faithfully, making his loss truly immeasurable.

Twenty-seventh day, Hinoto-hitsuji (丁未), clear then rain. Today Librarian Yamaguchi Udayu Yukiatsu received imperial permission for concurrent appointment. This Yukiatsu is the sixth son of Agata-nushi Kenkō. ○ Our noble house has long suffered financial difficulties, and in recent years the treasury situation has gradually worsened, causing great hardship. Therefore, after the current Bon festival, strict economizing was ordered. Senior Retainer Namba Iyo-no-kami as head offered to decline 2 koku of stipend rice, Chamberlains Sasaki and Murata each 2 koku of office rice, Accounting Department members myself, Okazaki, Ijichi and others each 1 koku of relief rice, and Stewards Imai and Fujita each 5 to of assistance rice, totaling 10 koku. Though we were ordered to continue receiving these through imperial compassion, since this would affect other economizing measures, we insisted on declining and our request was granted. ○ Due to over a thousand trees at Nara's Kasuga Shrine being broken and toppled, this was reported to the Imperial Court, and seven days of sacred kagura performances were ordered at Nara according to precedent. However, this follows the example during Lord Kaneteru's tenure in our house. Indeed, this year's continuous rain since the fourth month caused decay, and rumors suggest the actual number reached ten thousand trees.

Twenty-ninth day, Kanoe-inu (庚戌), clear. Tsunenori began his first tour of duty at the shrine, presenting one cask and one type offering.

Eighth Month (small month)

First day, Mizunoe-ne (壬子), clear. Palace celebrations concluded as usual. The farmers of our domain made their customary courtesy visits and were given celebratory sake. Though there was usually a cup ceremony, from this year due to economizing, cups were only given to head village officials with a limit of three rounds.

Eleventh day, Mizunoe-inu (壬戌), overcast then rain. Minami Gensuke submitted a request for crop inspection of the Semigagaito rice fields. I immediately took Kameshirō and inspected them, finding them to be 6 bu quality, 8 bu yield. Therefore I ordered that an average 1 bu yield exemption should be granted, to be conveyed through Kameshirō.

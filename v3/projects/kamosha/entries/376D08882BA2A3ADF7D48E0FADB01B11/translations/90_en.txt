Orders were given to strike down and cut them down systematically. Since it was difficult to predict whether members of this rebel band might flee to this area, Doi Ōi-no-kami sent word that any suspicious persons who might cross over should be arrested. This is communicated for your information. If there are urgent matters concerning the Imperial Palace, they should be reported immediately.

20th day of the 2nd month

The yoriki and dōshin of Matsudaira Izu-no-kami's group have been ordered to patrol within the palace grounds at night and are making their rounds. Regarding this, if anyone appears suspicious, even if they claim to be retainers of the Sekke families, Imperial families, or court nobles, depending on circumstances they may be arrested and interrogated. This has been communicated beforehand. Therefore, I report this matter.

20th day of the 2nd month

These two documents were transmitted from the Densō (Imperial messengers) as usual.

22nd day, 庚午, Clear - The accounting for the Gold-stake Lecture was completed as usual. ○ Seo Jihei has been ill since the 15th of this month with urinary retention, and his condition has been particularly poor for the past day or two, so I went to visit him. His pain appears quite severe. Several physicians including Fukui, Kurano, Irako, and Sugiyama have treated him, but since his urine would not pass, I recommended and arranged for Shingū Ryōtei to examine him. He arrived after a short while, and called his disciple named Iori, who inserted a catheter through the urethra. During the night, urine passed twice for the first time, about 7.5 gō. His son Mashirō and the clerks were greatly delighted.

23rd day, 辛未, Clear - I stayed overnight at the Seo residence from yesterday. This morning again, when Shingū's disciple used the catheter, much pus and fluid had accumulated in the urethra, making urination difficult. Despite various efforts, it would not pass, and they said all methods had been exhausted. Therefore, Ogino medicine was used again, and I informed the Shingū side of this decision. I returned home around the hour of Hitsuji (around 2 PM).

24th day, 壬申, Cloudy then rain - While going to visit the Seo Yahei residence, I encountered a messenger on the way.

The arrangement was completed and I made the proper greetings, with the family meeting for the first time. The residence is on the west side north of Imadegawa on Teramachi. Since this was a private matter, I went in regular dress followed by formal court dress.

Last Day, Hinoto-Uma: Clear. From about the hour of the rat last night until this morning there was wind and rain, followed by clear weather.
○As Tsunehiro still did not have a seal, I had previously commissioned one from a seal engraver on the north side of Imadegawa street west of Karasuma, and it was completed today. I provided Chinese water buffalo horn and paid three shu in gold for an eight-bu reverse seal with inverted characters, no silk wrapping, and box fee. ○From last evening the annual Gotoshiro performance took place as usual. However, since Nō master Kawakatsu Gonrokurō was in mourning, his substitute Terada Genroku performed.

Seventh Month (short month)
1st Day, Tsuchinoe-Hitsuji: Clear. Toshiaki came wearing second-rank court dress, accompanied by Seisan. We exchanged greetings regarding Tsunehiro's preliminary adoption agreement this time. Tsunehiro also wore hemp court dress for their first meeting, and there were very auspicious and congratulatory greetings. Then [gifts] were placed on a noshi stand which Tsunehiro brought out and were received by Toshiaki. They departed after a short time.
○Regarding Tsunehiro's move to Toshiaki's residence, it is arranged for early August, with immediate application for his first court rank.

Regarding this preliminary agreement matter, I previously sent letters to inform Yamamoto Sakyō in Ōtsu, Ikai Shōzaburō in Tehara village, and others. ○Regarding the submission of the family registry to Toshiaki's household for Tsunehiro's adoption and succession, it should have been submitted directly in the sixth month, but was delayed because the seal was not yet completed. Today it was sealed. The copy is as follows. This will of course be reported to the palace by Toshiaki.

Outer wrapper: Mino paper, marked "Family Registry"
Writing paper: Medium hōsho paper. However, it was later rewritten and submitted with court ranks removed as appropriate.

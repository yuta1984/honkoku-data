Fifteenth day, Kinoto-hitsuji (乙未), clear. For the Tsunekazu family gathering, I had Tsunenori and Tsunehiro issue time notices early in the morning. With the offering of sacred sake, eight people assembled: Tsunetsugu, Tsuneyoshi, Nobetsune, Tsunetake, Tsunetate, Tsunechika, Tsuneki (note: representing Tsunehitsu), and Tsuneari. During the meal, three rounds of sake were served, with the first two rounds being sacred sake, followed by several more rounds of ceremonial sake. Tsuneyuki presented one special gift. Tsunetsugu from the treasury administration sent one monme of silver for lodging expenses as usual. It concluded auspiciously after the mi hour (around 10 AM). The family box was immediately sent to Mitsetsune's place, last year's host.

Twenty-sixth day, Hinoe-uma (丙午), clear. I had Tsunenori serve as shrine duty parishioner representative. ○ After Kai-no-kami Koho passed away on the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month, there was no one of senior rank who desired his Kifune rice field, so it remained under provisional administration. Tsuneyuki applied for it and received it today. Properly dressed in formal court attire, he went to the shrine compound, and received a scroll from meeting place official Sueyoshi most auspiciously. ○ There has been a recent official notice that next year in the fourth month, the Eastern Regent will move the Western Palace Lord to the main palace. ○ From this time, the price has become 175 monme per koku, and accordingly, the magistrate's office occasionally sends rice and money to Kyoto as relief, to be distributed to those in distress.

Twenty-seventh day, Hinoto-hitsuji (丁未), clear. In gratitude for receiving the Kifune rice field yesterday, I visited the shrine early in the morning and offered sacred sake as usual to the main shrine, Kataoka shrine, Shingu shrine, Ōta shrine, and others.

Tenth Month (small month)

First day, Kanoto-i (辛亥), clear. The household lottery was held as usual with purification robes. I was invited by stable superintendent Aiko and attended.

Third day, Mizunoto-ushi (癸丑), clear. At the tora hour (around 4 AM), the Kyoto Deputy Matsudaira Izu-no-kami went out from this place to the imperial mud pond for bird hunting. This concerns storage facilities at both ends of the shrine compound. ○ This time, regarding Okamoto Taitō-dayū Kiyoha's hereditary domain annual tax rice: Uji five tan, regular yield five to, imperial rice one shō, Uji Kuroda yield three to five shō two gō, total eight to six shō one gō, barrel fee silver

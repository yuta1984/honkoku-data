They said they would send someone, but Tsunechika also replied that he would not agree to this. It was arranged that items would be sent from the other party to the Otsu warehouse, and from our side we would also send someone there together. The deadline was set for between tomorrow the 20th and the 23rd. Regarding other matters - various expenses related to Chiko's return home and ritual impurity from childbirth, as well as clothing prepared and sent by the other party - these are still being discussed through Yasufumi.

20th day, Kinoto-I, clear weather: Around the hour of Mi (9-11 AM), Goto Saichiro came and examined Tsunenori. His nervous condition calmed down somewhat. In the evening, Kameshiro and Daishichiro stayed overnight. ○This morning, there was a fire on Nawate Street below Sanjo that burned down about one building.

21st day, Hinoe-Ne, clear weather: To collect Michi's belongings, today I consulted with Fujita Yuzaemon of the palace catering department, and had him assign ten water transport laborers under a man called Tohei, who went to collect them from the Otsu Watanabe family warehouse. The belongings consisted of two chest of drawers, one long chest, one package of hanging scrolls, etc. The hanging scrolls made up one large package that was borrowed from the palace for transport. Although these belongings were to be brought directly to our place this evening, since Tsunenori is currently ill, I consulted with Horikawa Omi-no-kami and for tonight they were taken to his house. Through Kisaburo, they will be transported here once Tsunenori recovers. Today's wages for the ten laborers were 322 mon each including sake money, with an additional 2 bu in gold, and about 1 ri in silver was given to Yuzaemon for lunch and pocket money.

22nd day, Hinoto-Ushi, clear weather: Fujita Gonzaemon reported that Michie's belongings were successfully collected yesterday the 21st and are being kept at Horikawa's place. I immediately sent word of this to Yasufumi.

25th day, Kanoe-Tatsu, clear weather: Yesterday the 24th, the retainer Yasuda Totomi-no-kami of the noble family passed away, so I went to pay condolences and sent 1 shu in gold as incense money.

28th day, Mizunoto-Hitsuji, clear weather: I consulted with Teisei about having him substitute for Tsunenori's regular attendance duties.

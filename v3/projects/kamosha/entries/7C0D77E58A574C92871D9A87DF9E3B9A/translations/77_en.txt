Stakes and other materials were driven into the ground based on the above calculations.

One: By summons from the magistrate Ben-dono, one person named Kiei came forward and appeared before the magistrate. Ben-dono granted an audience and the matters he discussed were as follows:
　One: Regarding the timing of inquiring to Ben-dono about the shrine relocation, there would be no verbal command, only observing Ben-dono's countenance.
　One: During the offerings and return prayers, the clapping would be one clap from the head priest, then a responding clap, then another clap from the head priest, alternating in this manner.
　One: The seat for worship at Kifune inner shrine was designated to be in the courtyard.
　One: Regarding the rest quarters for the main shrine ceremony, where the Great Outer Secretary and the Official Affairs Officer were listed as sharing lodging - since this time the Official Affairs Officer has an impediment and Deputy Right Senior Official is participating in his stead, the Great Outer Secretary requests separate accommodations. Although troublesome for the shrine community, the arrangements should be revised so that the Great Outer Secretary has one house alone, while the Deputy Right Senior Historian lodges together with the historians and below in their rest quarters, and this should be brought tomorrow.

The rest is abbreviated.

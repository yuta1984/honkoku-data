In addition to the above, it was announced that the court ceremony would be held on the last day of the month, and imperial messengers would visit on the same day. They asked whether this would cause any problems for the shrine community, and since the imperial edicts for the six shrines would also be issued on the last day of the month, they inquired on what date we should appear to request the imperial edicts. They requested that responses to both matters be submitted together.

One: Regarding the above, the concerned parties gathered in the evening for consultation. First, they would report to the Western Administrator's Office and appear tomorrow. Also, on the coming 25th, verbal imperial appointment documents for transfers and new appointments would be handed over, and at that time there would be no impediment to the court ceremony execution on the last day of the month and the same-day visit of imperial messengers. Regarding the imperial edicts for the formal relocations of Shingu and the other five shrines below it, 

they could appear on any day up to the 10th of the 8th month, so it was decided that it would be appropriate to request that the imperial messenger provide guidance at a convenient time. With this decided, everyone dispersed.

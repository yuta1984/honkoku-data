1. Enpo privately conveyed a message from the imperial messenger (densō). The message stated: "Regarding the imperial decree ceremonies and offerings that took place during the Enpō and Shōtoku [eras], where exactly did the shrine officials sit? Please prepare detailed written documentation and have the representative bring it." Additionally, according to Yasutoshi's explanation, Enpo stated: "During the Kanpō reconstruction, when the imperial messenger made offerings, there were concerns about rain showers, so the shrine community was prepared for the offerings to take place in the sacred pavilion (osekiya). However, in Lord Hirohashi's diary from the Kanpō period, it states 'henceforth it shall be changed to the sacred pavilion.' The reason for this was the question of propriety regarding shrine officials sitting before the deity while the imperial messenger made offerings in the courtyard, hence the change this time. It was not at all due to concerns about rain showers, so this time as well, [the court] wishes to know where the shrine officials will be seated."

Furthermore, what was privately conveyed to Enpo earlier was: "Regarding Kōtokui's purification implements being provided by the shrine families, this was ordered through written instructions from Magistrate Lord Hinonishi. According to previous precedent, when Kōtokui made personal requests, the shrine community would provide them. However, being ordered officially as in this case differs from previous precedent, so we would like to respectfully decline. We would like to appeal directly to the magistrate," but when this was conveyed privately, Enpo's response was: "I privately reported this, and if it was not the shrine community's responsibility to provide [these implements] according to previous precedent, then the imperial messenger (densō) has instructed to respectfully decline to the magistrate explaining this situation."

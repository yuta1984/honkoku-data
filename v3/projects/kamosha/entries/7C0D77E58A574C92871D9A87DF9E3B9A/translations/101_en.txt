Upon the imperial visit, the General Administrator receives the tatami mats brought by the Palace Cleaning Bureau and spreads them on the courtyard ground under the eaves of the sacred temporary shelter. After being seated and the divine relocation is completed, [the imperial messenger] enters the taboo hut as before. This is said to be due to imperial attendance protocol. There are no attendants, and Hōshō provides guidance through presentation.
1. Similarly, after the imperial edict ceremony is completed, next comes the sequence of imperial ritual offerings. These involve the imperial messenger, controller, and assistant official.
　The seat for imperial ritual offerings is the same as for the imperial edict, but there was an instruction from the imperial messenger beforehand to set it up in the courtyard. However, due to intermittent light rain, though it was not a rain ceremony, it was ordered through Hōshō to conduct it in the sacred temporary shelter. Accordingly, that seat was set up in the second chamber from the west of the sacred temporary shelter. The imperial advance is distant from the first chamber. For the seats, the imperial messenger has green borders, the controller and assistant official have yellow borders, arranged by the Palace Cleaning Bureau as usual.
1. For the imperial ritual offerings, all three sacred tables are presented, then the head priest performs minor intermediary duties with Imperial Messenger Hamashima, Governor of Harima (he is the advance person, wearing full court dress), Controller Kitamen Hayamizu, Governor of Kazusa (wearing hunting robes and court dress, bearing a sword), and for the assistant official, attendants in plain court dress serve. During the above imperial ritual offerings, shrine attendants hold torches near Haji-no-o Shrine (under direction of the General Administrator). The head priest's response prayer is performed on the outer veranda of the prayer hut. For the above three sacred tables' ritual offerings, Head Priest Hirohisa prepared them in advance upon request to the shrine. The ritual wands are made of hinoki cypress, four shaku five sun long, one sun two bu wide, seven bu thick. The paper uses large formal paper, two sheets layered in four streamers (however, small mats with straw path matting are laid and set up here, at the General Administrator's discretion).
1. The assistant official presents the imperial edict to the imperial messenger inside the middle gate, then waits in a small chamber outside the middle gate where a round seat is temporarily set up. This ceremony is arranged thus according to preferences at the time.
1. Knotted lamp stands are set up on the left and right in front of the seats for the imperial edict and imperial ritual offerings. These are provided by the Carpentry Bureau, and the fire is lit from the imperial storehouse.
1. After all imperial ritual offerings are completely finished and [the messenger] enters the taboo hut again, officials present ritual offering containers - four matching lacquered boxes which General Administrators Kiyoashi and Yasutake receive and transport to the council chamber.
1. The head priest's ritual offerings are performed in the small courtyard. Both the minor intermediary and intermediary are Assistant Head Priest Yasuhisa.
1. For this occasion, white curtains are uniformly used for the divine presence, and the hanging method is on the east sliding boards of the main hall.

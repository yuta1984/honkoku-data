Before the ceremonial food servers, three shrine attendants were supposed to carry torches, but due to their late arrival, this was barely managed with just one person.
　The procedure for the imperial messenger and others' arrival was roughly as follows:
　First, three miscellaneous attendants led the procession, pulling iron staffs for path-clearing up to the second torii. Next came the sacred offering
　items in four bitter orange chests, with officials wearing rain capes due to the rainy weather in attendance. Next came the imperial messenger (in court dress with ceremonial sword),
　then the vice-minister (same as above), then the controller (in court dress) (the above hospitality officials led the way providing guidance). First, dismounting from palanquins at the base of the first torii
　and entering the torii, the Bureau of Divination performed purification rites. Next, when entering the second torii,
　the imperial messenger first bowed toward the shrine officials and below; the shrine officials and ceremonial food servers crouched low. Next, the vice-minister
　bowed, and each performed respectful genuflection. Next, the controller bowed, and each crouched low. Within the tower gate, the head priest did likewise.
　Regarding the imperial messenger's initial bow, this had been ordained by the court liaison in advance. Next, various
　officials formed ranks and proceeded. The four bitter orange chests of offering items were temporarily
　carried and placed on the west side near the stone platform and ablution area within the tower gate. After the controller and others proceeded to the curtained area,
　the chief administrator provided guidance, and they advanced to the divine presence, setting up the items in the courtyard. However, although they should have been

　arranged in the courtyard, due to the rain, reed mats were spread
　from the west side of the matted pavilion toward the third and fourth chambers, and the items were arranged there with the west taking precedence. The imperial messenger and vice-minister first entered the taboo hut
　within the tower gate to wait. The controller, historians, student historians, left and right officials, and summoned attendants
　took seats in the curtained area before the Wakamiya Shrine. Other officials from senior secretary down, having no designated seats,
　waited in the eastern area of the matted pavilion or within the tower gate, etc.

1. The senior head priests and ceremonial food servers below, after greeting the imperial messenger, returned through the Daily Offering Gate.
　The head priest group proceeded from the first chamber from the south under the pure shelves of the offering hall to take their seats before the divine presence.
　This ceremony involved taking seats on the west-facing corridor from beneath the temporary shrine's edge boards. However, the head priest
　faced west in the center, the head priest group faced south in eastern precedence order, and the ritualist group faced north in eastern precedence order, positioned facing each other for
　seating. The ten ceremonial food servers took seats in a single row facing east in northern precedence order at the west provision house (these being the senior head priests and below).
　Ablution facilities were set up at the eastern end of the west offering hall. The head priest's ablution area was
　set up on the open veranda of the head priest group's transparent corridor. During the shrine officials' ablutions, the administrative official served in this capacity.

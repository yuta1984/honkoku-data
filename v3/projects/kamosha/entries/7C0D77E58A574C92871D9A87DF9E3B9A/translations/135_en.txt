The above should be circulated promptly without delay, and returned to my residence from the village where it stops.

1. The notice prohibiting cattle and horses was conveyed to the magistrate of Shichicho Doroike Hiiragi-hara.
1. Festival spears were erected at both Kifune's two torii gates and inner torii gates. This was arranged under the direction of the chief magistrate. However, there were two spears each on the left and right at each location.
1. The purification ritual of Kifune Mizusha was conducted in the courtyard in the early morning, and the purification of the new shrine at the inner shrine was performed at the hour of the snake.
For both shrines, the onmyoji (yin-yang master) Kenji-kan Genshu participated. The cleaning and sweeping along with the inner compilation was done on the 29th, with two people for the three-sun dedication and transfer offerings, and two tōne participating.

1. The sacred treasures of the inner shrine were displayed in the worship hall, and from the hour of the snake to the hour of the sheep, people from the valley and elsewhere were permitted to view them. Instructions were given from the front guard post to the valley.
1. After viewing the sacred treasures, they were displayed inside the shrine. The head priest and both officials wore court dress, while the transfer offering attendants wore purification robes. White curtains were hung, and the inner shrine was decorated inside early in the morning of that day. The sacred treasures were placed in a Chinese chest in the inner worship hall, and shrine attendants were assigned night watch duty. Night watch was also assigned to shrine attendants at the worship hall the previous night.
1. As the daily offerings of the previous day, two meals each were offered to the inner shrine and worship hall. The offering negi priests and two transfer offering attendants came forth, and the tōne first made offerings from the worship hall shrine. Because this involved the sacred treasures of the worship hall, the land blessing liturgy transfer offering attendants sat on circular mats in the courtyard. In the Kanpō era, offerings were made two days after the shrine relocation, but this time after consultation, offerings were made on both the day before and after. These were morning imperial meals. Of the four meals for the inner shrine and worship hall, three were for the head priest and both officials, and one was for each direct meeting. The head priest celebrant did not attend.
1. Although great effort was made to erect spears at both the inner shrine and worship hall at the magistrate's guard post, this was unprecedented.

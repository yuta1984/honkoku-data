Having received the above instructions, [the official] proceeded to the Imperial Messenger and reported this matter. As an additional matter for Kanemochi's understanding, what was conveyed to the various stewards was that at Kibune, sake would not be offered outside of the well enclosure, and this should be mentioned when meeting with various government offices - this would also serve as proper guidance.

1. After completing the above, Kanemochi alone proceeded to the Western Government Office, where Mano Hachirobei met with him and conveyed the following: Regarding the Kibune shrine relocation, the Imperial Palace has ordered that dangerous spots along the bridges on the Imperial Messenger's route be inspected and repaired. Therefore, village officials along the route were summoned to the government office and given orders, with village headmen and elders required to provide written acknowledgments. However, for Kamo, since Kamo handles its own arrangements, no notification was necessary, as conveyed from the Imperial Palace, so no written acknowledgment was required. As a precaution regarding this matter, [he asked] whether any villages might have been overlooked and requested a review. Upon review, it was confirmed that no villages had been overlooked, and it was answered that arrangements for Kamo had been made previously.

Next, today at Magistrate Hinozai Ben's office, a notification document regarding the list of participants was presented and received by Hachirobei.

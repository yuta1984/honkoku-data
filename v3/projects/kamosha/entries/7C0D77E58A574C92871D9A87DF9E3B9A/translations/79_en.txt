1. Around the hour of the Monkey (3-5 PM), a small assembly was held at the retreat quarters, where the six monthly duty officers and related personnel gathered. Assembly leader Mori Akira announced that a request had been made by the Superintendent of Poetry Department: the ritual garments previously requested had not yet been distributed. Since the formal reconstruction ceremony is approaching, they requested to borrow them just for the day of the ceremony and return them afterward.
　　In the deliberation, after the Shōtoku-era shrine records were consulted at the 12th day assembly and assigned to the monthly duty officers, since there has been no general assembly, for the formal reconstruction ceremony day, they should attend wearing the 140 sets of garments previously distributed per assigned quota. It was decided to make another announcement at the next assembly. Also, regarding the poetry department, there are current shortages, and since there are no official duties for the reconstruction ceremony, if they wish to participate voluntarily, they should do so at their own

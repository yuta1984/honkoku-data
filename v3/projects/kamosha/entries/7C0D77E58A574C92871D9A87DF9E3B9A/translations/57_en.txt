Following the imperial command, each received [the documents] in order. As per custom, we expressed our gratitude, and on this occasion submitted diagrams and procedural documents for the formal reconstruction of the Main Shrine and Kifune End, which were duly received. We then visited Lord Hinowari Ben, the magistrate, and expressed our gratitude for the above. On this occasion, we submitted diagrams of Kataoka and Kifune Inner areas and procedural documents for the Kataoka Shrine formal reconstruction, but left them as he was absent. We then went to the non-courtier entrance, and when summoned by Magistrate Ben, we went and reported. In the audience, he conveyed that for the formal reconstruction, purification implements from the Bureau of Divination should be prepared, and gave us written instructions. Furthermore, Kōtokui would also notify the shrine community, so we should proceed according to previous precedent:

1. Sacred sake - placed in small vessels
1. Scattered rice - placed on second-tier offering stands  
1. Sacred wands - one piece, hinoki cypress wood
1. Front tablets - one stand, hinoki cypress wood
1. Knee cloth - one piece
1. Coarse mats - two pieces

1. For the ceremony of presenting offerings by the court official, we request that the shrine community prepare these items.
1. Regarding lodging assignments for various officials, written instructions will be submitted later. Whether the magistrate will convey this to the officials or the shrine community should communicate it, in any case it should be handled according to previous precedent.
1. On the day itself, the various officials wish to conduct an inspection, so we should understand this and make arrangements accordingly. We acknowledged this and withdrew. We then reported this matter to the court liaison.

1. After the hour of the monkey, Shiaken returned home and reported that he met Murayama Tomiemon, who said that for security requests, there were precedents from Shōtoku era, and in Kanpō they used the Shōtoku precedent. Since there is none this time, example documents should be submitted separately, and the dates and times for minor shrine formal reconstructions should also be written out.

1. To Komori Tenyaku-no-kami regarding the reconstruction of Main Shrine and Kifune, we sent a letter through the representatives requesting that toso [ceremonial sake] be prepared according to previous precedent, and a reply was received.
The gist being that for the upcoming 19th day Kamo Main Shrine formal reconstruction and 2nd day of 9th month Kifune formal reconstruction,

As reported, yesterday at the Western Office, it was stated that there would be no security due to the vacancy of the Shoshidai position. Regarding this matter, from last night until now, various requests have been made and consultations held between the Eastern and Western offices. However, it was decided that security matters require inquiry to the East (the shogunate), and since no directive has yet been received, it would be difficult to provide. This has caused great confusion. Certainly, there has never been a precedent for formal relocation ceremonies proceeding without security, so we earnestly request that proper arrangements be made and directives issued, even if it means providing some form of escort. When we conveyed our desire for security to be provided, it was reported, and later when we met, it was said that oral communication would not suffice, and a written petition should be submitted. Suenaga stated that since submitting a written document was a special matter, it should be done as a formal written report as usual. When he mentioned to Daizen that it might be inappropriate for him alone to sign, it was further reported that both names should be used to carefully prepare and promptly submit the document. It was also stated that imperial audience would be granted once the document was submitted. Therefore, he quickly returned home, consulted with the responsible parties, and brought the completed document as follows:

Respectfully Submitted
Regarding formal relocation ceremonies of the main shrine, according to precedent, security has been provided by the Shoshidai, so for this occasion as well, we requested the same from the officials as before. However, last night at the Western Office, we were informed that due to the Shoshidai vacancy, no security would be provided. Consequently, the shrine community again requested that security be provided by whichever officials possible, since this is an important formal relocation ceremony. We submitted written petitions repeatedly to the monthly duty Eastern Office, and although investigations were conducted, we were told that since Shoshidai security matters require consultation with the East and no directive has been received, nothing can be done, and our petitions were returned. From ancient times, there has never been a precedent for conducting formal relocation ceremonies without security when imperial messengers and others participate. The entire shrine community finds this lamentable and deeply concerning. Since military affairs are as described above, the shrine community has no other recourse for appeals. Since this concerns reverence for the divine, we humbly request that special consideration be given and appropriate measures be taken. The entire shrine community respectfully petitions for this. That is all.

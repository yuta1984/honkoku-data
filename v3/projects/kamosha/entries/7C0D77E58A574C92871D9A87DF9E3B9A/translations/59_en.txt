The above precedent documents were also brought to the Western Administrative Office. Returned home after the hour of the sheep (around 2 PM). According to the report: Earlier at the western [office], I encountered Murayama Tomiemon, so I submitted the Kanpō-era security precedent documents for the formal shrine reconstruction. After they received them, what was subsequently issued stated that regarding the formal reconstruction, an imperial envoy would be dispatched, and a written list of names of all participating officials should be submitted. Since no written list of names had yet been delivered from the imperial court, I replied that I would report as soon as it was handed down. They replied that the written list should be submitted promptly once the information becomes available. Also, they stated that written lists of landlords' names should be submitted for all rest facilities for the imperial envoy and below, various officials, and all general rest facilities for military house officials, as soon as [the arrangements] are finalized. After completing the above, [I] withdrew.

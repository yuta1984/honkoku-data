stating that it would be brought to the monthly duty office, whereupon he returned home promptly.

1. Regarding the above, first they brought a petition of inquiry to the West Office based on what Maeda had said, as follows:

　　　　　Respectful Inquiry Statement
Concerning the formal relocation ceremony of Kamigamo Main Shrine on the coming 19th, while officials of the shoshidai office were to be dispatched according to previous precedent, we have been informed and acknowledge that no security guard will be provided due to the current vacancy in the shoshidai position. The formal relocation ceremony of the main shrine is a matter of great importance, with the imperial envoy and others participating, so it would be most lamentable if there were no security for the sacred precincts. Should we petition the monthly duty office to dispatch officials of some department? Since this concerns your jurisdiction, we submit this matter in writing. We respectfully petition as one shrine united that security be provided according to previous precedent. The above.

　　　　　Petition Statement
　　Concerning the officials of the shoshidai office for the formal relocation ceremony of Kamigamo Main Shrine on the coming 19th, while we were previously informed that they would be dispatched according to precedent, we have now been informed and acknowledge that no security guard will be provided due to the current vacancy in the shoshidai position. The formal relocation ceremony is a matter of great importance, with the imperial envoy and others participating, so it would be lamentable if there were no security for the sacred precincts. Since there has been no precedent of not dispatching officials from the shoshidai office, we respectfully petition as one shrine that officials from any department be ordered to provide security around the shrine on that day. The above.

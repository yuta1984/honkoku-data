On the day of the above viewing, the monthly duty officers from the sacred treasures section and sacred vestments section shall attend and make arrangements.

1. According to Hosho's statement, it was conveyed through Enpo from the imperial messenger that on the coming 19th day for the formal shrine relocation, the shrine community should coordinate so that all matters proceed without delay, and the imperial messenger also intends to arrive at this location around the hour of the Sheep.

By council decision: shrine officials and below should attend without being late, and regarding decorations within the main shrine, these should be prepared from early morning on the day itself. Since during the Shotoku era the imperial curtained dais and tatami mats were also set up the day before, following that precedent, it was decided that twelve tatami mats and the imperial curtained dais should be decorated and placed the day before this time as well.

1. Hosho asked whether the sacred offerings for the subsidiary shrines' inner sanctuaries should be offered with the temporary shrine doors opened.

By council decision: as previously decided, except for the Aoi sacred ritual, the doors shall not be opened, and offerings shall be prepared in one location at the great platform for both inner and outer sanctuaries. The imperial offerings shall be all types of imperial offerings.

1. A written document was submitted from the head priest to the Master of Divination, presenting a calendar calculation for the formal relocation days of Kamo Kifune subsidiary shrines.

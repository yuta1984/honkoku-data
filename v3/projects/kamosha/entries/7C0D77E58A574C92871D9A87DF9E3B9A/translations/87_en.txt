One: Around the Hour of the Dragon, decorations inside the main hall were arranged, and the work was completed around the half of the Hour of the Snake. Twenty-one shrine priests in religious retreat (each wearing court dress with one hakucho attendant), ten food servers (wearing purification robes and hakama), an onmyoji named Akira (wearing court dress with hakucho attendant), and four tōne priests attended. Particularly around the area of worship before the deities, white curtains were hung in double layers (arranged by the head administrator). Sacred treasures were transported from the treasure storehouse to the blessing hall, and sacred garments were brought from the head priest's residence. Under the accompaniment of Yoshisue, superintendent of the sacred vestment office, shrine priests and food servers worked together to wipe and purify everything. Water was drawn from the sacred Mono-imi River, soaked into sakaki leaves, and used to purify everything thoroughly.

Next, the onmyoji came forward and performed purification with sacred hemp as usual. Then the head priest placed sacred garments and ritual implements into four large and small sacred boxes and covered them. Next, the shrine priests and food servers

advanced into the inner sanctuary. However, regarding the sacred shore platform, twelve tatami mats, thick tatami, and large room tatami, since there was precedent for this, after consultation it was decided for convenience to place them the previous day. The decorative items installed today were roughly as follows:

One: Sacred cushion　　　　　　　One: Bamboo blind　One: Sacred cord
One: Sacred canopy　　　　　　　One: Wall substitute　One: Sacred screen

　The above are furnishings for the inner sanctuary

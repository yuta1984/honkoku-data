One: After the hour of the Horse, representatives Hisahisa and Kanemochi returned home and explained, saying that first they went to Administrator Hinoki-sai Ben-dono and requested that the date inquiry document submitted earlier be exchanged. It was immediately exchanged. The folded document and time inquiry document were submitted to the Imperial messenger, then they went to the West Government Office where they met Murayama Tomiemon. Since the Imperial Palace had preferences regarding the relocation dates, the document was revised. When they requested the exchange of the previously submitted time inquiry notification document, it was immediately accepted and exchanged. On this occasion, Tomiemon mentioned that regarding the presence or absence of the administrator's attendance at the relocation, after examining the precedents from the Shotoku and Kanpo eras, a written report should be submitted by the day after tomorrow.

One: At the council chamber, pure white robes, hakama trousers, court caps, folding fans, etc. were distributed to 140 people. Each received them while wearing formal court dress. However, due to impediments, Dai, Ken, Yonehisa, and Ikyu were entrusted to the shrine community. The deputy head priest and song officials were accepted by the shrine community according to custom.

One: After the hour of the Sheep, a summons arrived from Hinoki-sai Ben-dono stating that the shrine representatives should immediately come to the Hi-kurodo entrance.

Regarding the discrepancy in the red markings on the diagram of Kibune Inner Shrine, it was replaced and brought; the record is as follows:
　　Folded official document
　　　　Memorandum of oral statement
Concerning the imperial envoy's courtyard
ceremony during the Enpō and Shōtoku main shrine formal reconstructions,
we have received an inquiry about where the shrine officials were seated.
During the formal reconstructions of Enpō, Shōtoku, and Kanpō,
the Controller was seated, and there were ceremonies for Senior Nobles and below, so
the Chief Priests and Ritualists, out of deference to the transparent corridor seats, were seated
in the Negi-gata crossing hall west of the temporary shrine, where all shrine officials were seated together. During the
ceremony as well, they were seated in that crossing hall. Regarding your inquiry about
precedent, we respectfully report this matter. The above.

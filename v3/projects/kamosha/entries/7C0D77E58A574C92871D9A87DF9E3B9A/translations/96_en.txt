1. Court musicians (each wearing court cap and robe, but receiving the ceremonial robes worn during the soul-installation ritual). They are seated in the west music pavilion as during the main festival.
　Preparations were made in advance by the repair office. However, each musician arrives after the deity transfer is completed.
　The roster of those in attendance is as follows: Yamanoi Chikuzen-no-kami, Abe Gagaku-no-suke, Toyo Oki-no-kami,
　　Abe Shinano-no-kami, Yamanoi Uhyōe-no-jō, Toyo Uemon-no-jō, etc. — six people in total.

1. After the shrine officials and ceremonial food service attendants take their positions at the shrine grounds, the Senior Secretary (wearing court dress and fourth-rank ceremonial robe) proceeds from the rest quarters to before the deity.
　The hospitality official Hajimeaki provides guidance at the north eaves of the middle gate, and the Secretary presents the imperial edict to the head priest.
　The head priest emerges from the side door (accompanied by the deputy, administrator, and deputy representative) to receive it and passes it to the Administrative Master. The Administrative 
　Master holds it aloft in the viewing box, proceeds forward to before the deity, and the head priest prepares it for divine viewing.
　Upon completion, the head priest returns and performs mutual bows with the Senior Secretary, who then withdraws. Next, the Deputy Secretary
　(due to the Secretary's impediment, Right Senior Historian Yamana Harima-no-kami serves as substitute) arrives (both the Right Secretary and Deputy Secretary attend with assistant envoys, messenger attendants, etc.). Three
　imperial edicts are presented to the head priest: the edict for the formal shrine transfer, the edict for sacred treasures and ritual vestments, and the edict for the offering envoy's attendance.
　The Administrative Master places them in the viewing box as before, proceeds forward, and the head priest prepares them for divine viewing.

　Upon completion, he returns and performs mutual bows with the historian, after which the historian withdraws. The head priest 
　retires to the communion hall. After this, all shrine officials don their ritual vestments.

1. Next, the divine offerings are dispatched from the offering hall, carried by the sword-bearer, while the yin-yang diviner takes position at the base of the sacred bridge for
　purification rites as usual. This differs from the standard procedure because, given the concern about confusion after the imperial messenger's
　arrival at the ritual hall corridor, prior notice was given to the court liaison, and it is conducted this way on this occasion.

1. Next, the imperial messenger and other court officials take their positions at the shrine grounds. By this time evening has fallen, so torches are lit from each rest quarters,
　and due to rainfall, umbrellas are held for the imperial messenger and others. Upon seeing the imperial messenger
　and others approach the first torii, the head priest and other shrine officials and ceremonial attendants emerge from the shrine grounds.
　The head priest advances to the west side near the temporary shrine of Tanao-sha within the tower gate to greet them
　(three officials in attendance, two shrine attendants carrying torches). The senior head priests and others emerge from the daily offering gate and form ranks to the west within the second torii,
　arranged with south as superior and facing east. This is to greet the imperial messenger and others. However, the shrine officials

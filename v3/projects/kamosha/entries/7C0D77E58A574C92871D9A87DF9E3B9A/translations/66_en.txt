1. After the hour of the Monkey (past 2 PM), the representative Kanemochi returned home and reported that he met with Fujino Hachirōbei at the West Administrative Office, who informed him that the request previously submitted regarding security, palace officials, both magistrates, and menial officials for the formal reconstruction of the three locations had been approved. On this occasion, he was told that since four or five construction supervisors would be coming for the formal reconstruction, arrangements should be made in advance for rest stations, and if space was insufficient, two buildings should be prepared. Then, when he went to the East Administrative Office, Inspector Tsumaki Ichinoshin appeared, so he submitted a notification stating that the same text of the security petition and precedent documents had been approved at the West Office the other day, which was immediately accepted.

1. Around the hour of the Monkey (around 3 PM), Kiēi returned home and reported that he had visited the magistrate and met with Assistant Inoue Tanomo. Recently, the Controller had given instructions that regarding the matter of imperial offerings on the day of the shrine reconstruction, the shrine community should take responsibility, with the head priests setting up the offerings, and documents regarding rest stations for Senior Nobles and below should be submitted. Also, regarding the matter that Kōtokui had recently reported through written documents, while investigating the purification implements for the day at the shrine community, he immediately went to head priest Kōtokui,

The content of the document that was handed down was carefully and wholeheartedly prepared as much as possible. The document that was handed down for this purpose was returned. This matter has traditionally been something that Kōtokui handles with dedication, but if it becomes the practice for the magistrate to give such instructions as in this case, it will eventually become items that the shrine community must prepare and supply, which would be troublesome, so he made a detailed request that this matter be approved and handled appropriately. Also, regarding the diagram of Kibune Inner Shrine that was recently submitted, since there were slight discrepancies in the red markings, he requested that it be replaced, but since the official was absent, the request was left pending. Then he went to the Imperial Messenger carrying documents for rest stations for Senior Nobles and below, and also submitted documents regarding the seating locations of shrine officials during the Enpō, Shōtoku, and Kanpō reconstructions that had been inquired about previously, but since the official was absent, the request was left pending.

Eleventh day, clear weather

1. After breakfast, Kane and Kiēi climbed the mountain to Kibune.

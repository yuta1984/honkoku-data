　　　　　　　Memorandum of oral statement
　　We were asked whether the Construction Administrator would be seated during the formal relocations of Kamigamo Main Shrine, Kataoka Shrine, and Kifune Shrine, so we report as follows:
　　　Kamigamo formal relocation
　　　　The Construction Administrator only stays at the shrine family's house and does not

　　　　　take a seat before the deity.
　　　　　In the Shōtoku era: magistrate group officers and constables; in the Kanpō era: deputy officials and clerks
　　　Kataoka Shrine formal relocation
　　　　Same as above
　　　Kifune Shrine formal relocation
　　　　The Construction Administrator stays at the lower guard post for subsidiary shrines. In the Shōtoku era:
　　　　magistrate group officers and constables; in Kanpō era: deputy officials and clerks.
　　　　However, there is no precedent of staying at the inner shrine.
　　　Regarding the above inquiry, we report that there is no precedent for Construction Administrators
　　　to attend occasions corresponding to this time, so according to precedent as written above,
　　　the duties are performed by deputy officials and below. Above

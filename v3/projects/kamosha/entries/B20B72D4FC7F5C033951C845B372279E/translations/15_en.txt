《Title: Record of Horse Racing》

【Editorial Notes】
【The particles "江 (e), 者 (wa), 而 (shite)" are kept as kanji characters.】
【Since the original text is a mixture of katakana and hiragana, katakana characters are rendered as katakana, and hiragana characters are kept as hiragana.】
【The character "リ (ri)" is difficult to distinguish between katakana and hiragana, so it is generally rendered as katakana, with some instances as hiragana.】

《Marginal note: Regarding the replacement due to overlapping seating arrangements of the kenshū and kishū groups》【Red ink】
Among this year's riders, there were three from the kenshū group and four from the kishū group, and because their seating arrangements overlapped, a messenger was sent from the seating group to their faction requesting replacements.

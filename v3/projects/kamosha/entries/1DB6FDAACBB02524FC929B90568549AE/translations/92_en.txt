《Matter of inquiry whether there would be taboo in presenting horses during the Shoshidai's mourning period》【Red ink】
One　In late April of the same year, the wife of Shoshidai Matsudaira Kii-no-kami-dono
　passed away. An inquiry was made whether there would be any taboo in
　presenting horse guards and such during the mourning period, and orders were given to
　report on shrine precedents. The shrine's report stated that since purification retreat had been
　conducted at a separate residence from the previous day, there would be no problem in presenting horse guards. Accordingly,

　following the shrine families' report, it was carried out as usual. The detailed
　documents of that report are in the shrine community diary, and are recorded in detail below.
《Matter of Kiyotsune serving as substitute for senior horseman because senior horseman Kiyoyori was in light mourning for one day》【Red ink】
One　This year was the first service for Takumi-no-jō Kiyoyori, and a substitute had been arranged, but on May
　1st, his elder sister Yoshiko《mother of Ujitomo》passed away. Therefore, he reported this to the Shoshi-dayū,
　and the evening assembly members gathered. Although a substitute had been arranged, it was said that there was no precedent
　for a person in mourning to ride. Accordingly, Tajima-no-kami Kiyotsune
《Matter of Kiyoyori serving as senior horseman next year》【Red ink】
　served as senior horseman. Kiyoyori is scheduled to serve at the beginning of next year,
　it is said. However, if there are impediments after the purification for shrine visit is completed, there are
　precedents, and he can ride as usual without problem.

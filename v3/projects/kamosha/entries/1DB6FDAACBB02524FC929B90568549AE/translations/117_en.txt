《Marginal note: Regarding the ritual procedures for offerings by kaidanka riders during rainy weather》【Written in red】
　One: On the 5th day, the offerings by kaidanka riders followed the rainy weather ritual procedures due to rain.
　　Each person took their seat in the ofuda-ya (talisman house)《Marginal note: with east as the upper position》, and the riders' offerings took place
　　in the ofuda-ya. The kaidanka offerings entered through the byōchū gate and ascended from the eastern side
　　of the norito-ya (prayer house), taking place in the norito-ya. This has been the procedure
　　since long ago. In recent years, it was the same in Genroku 15th year as well.
　　This year, when the riders sat in the chō-ya (office building) for the divine offering banquet, there was
　　debate from the front regarding whether or not to remove the ranso (ceremonial cords), but no decision was reached. This year, only (the leftmost) Shigetatsu
　　removed them, while all others kept them on for the divine offering banquet wearing ranso. Due to the rainy
　　weather ritual, while ascending the hall with muddy straw sandals, each person could not take their seat from the front

　　but instead took their positions from the rear. However, in the previous year and the year before that,
《Marginal note: The right-side kaidanka claiming illness and not taking their seat in the chō-za》【Written in red】
　　each person removed their ranso. The left-side kaidanka took their seat in the chō-za, but the right-side rider
　　did not agree with not removing the ranso, so claiming illness as the reason,
　　did not take their seat in the chō-za and withdrew.

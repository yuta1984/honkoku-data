at that place engaged in various idle talk, and furthermore when Ujiryo was departing, lay in wait at the corner of Yamamoto-
　　chō and repeatedly made excessive remarks. Due to this, Ujiryo had no choice but to strike with his whip,
　　whereupon the man instead took up a staff and confronted him, destroying his court cap and other items. Although Ujiryo had
　　his own thoughts on the matter, since he was dressed in the formal attire of a Shinto ritual and could not act as he wished,

　　a messenger and delivered an oral statement saying: "When I received your messenger earlier, I was at the horse grounds and could not respond immediately.
　　However, I have now understood what was conveyed to me, and regarding the court cap

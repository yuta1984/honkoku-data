《Marginal note: Ujinaga ran wildly from behind on the reverse course and lost》【Red ink】

In the seventh horse race, Kii-no-kami's horse was pulled down at the slope. Miki-no-kami Suemasa also struck immediately. After a while, Kii-no-kami rode alone. Although he had lost, he tried to go up to the left to receive a reward, but this was prevented and he was not allowed to receive the reward. At that time he dismounted and returned to the village. This was unprecedented in recent years. Twenty horses with saddles were all magnificently appointed - such things had not occurred in recent years. During the absence of the Regent for his eastern campaign, western warriors remained in Kyoto as guards, and these were the horses and saddles of the Shikoku warriors.

In the ninth race on the left initially, due to the distant journey of Minbu-no-jō's elderly mother, ladies-in-waiting and Kyōfuku attendants became substitute riders.

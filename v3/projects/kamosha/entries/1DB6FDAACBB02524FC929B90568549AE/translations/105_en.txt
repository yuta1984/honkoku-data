This morning, we were summoned by Lord Bōjō, Major Counselor and Kamo court liaison, and
he conveyed that the conducting of the horse racing ritual involves festivities and crowd
gatherings, and His Majesty considers this inappropriate for the current circumstances, so it would be proper to cancel it.
The above is submitted for notification. Above stated.

　　　　　　　There is no fixed address for the Palace Administrator
Due to the above matter, we also attended upon the Palace Administrator to make this notification.

　　　Oral report humbly submitted for inquiry
Last evening, we were summoned by Lord Bōjō, Major Counselor and Kamo court liaison, and
he conveyed that regarding the horse racing ritual, if crowds gather and it extends into the city,
His Majesty considers this inappropriate for the current circumstances. However, since there are precedents of conducting [such rituals] when attending the Magistrate's Office during such circumstances, His Majesty thinks it would be acceptable
to proceed. Therefore, we should make an inquiry and conduct it according to your directive.
This is what was commanded. As it is as stated above, we humbly submit this inquiry. Above stated.

《Marginal note: Matter of Lord Nobunaga's (5th day) son coming to observe》【Red ink】
It rained on both days, and the young Lord Oda came to observe. A献酒 (ceremonial drink offering) was presented from the entire group. Horses were provided by Lord Nobunaga on both days, which was most admirable and excellent. In the third race, Nakatsukasa-dayū (Mitsuhisa) on the left and Hyōgo-no-suke (Yasutomo) on the right had a contest without proper踏み擦り (starting procedure), and there was an obstruction at the embankment. A messenger came from below saying "ride again," but they did not ride again. Nakatsukasa-dayū lost and Hyōgo-no-suke won. This was a bad precedent.

One text says: At that time, twenty horses were provided by Oda Danjō-chū Taira Nobunaga.

Two of these were Nobunaga's own horses. One horse was positioned at Shidori, and Awaji-no-kami Ujiyori rode it on the first day. One horse was positioned at Shingū Negi, and Kunai-shōyū Yasumochi rode it, advancing to the second race. At that time, Kunai-shōyū's wife was in light mourning attire for Chikugo-no-kami Ujiyoshi. Nevertheless, Kunai-shōyū rode on the first day. These saddles and full equipment were new, and by imperial command that shrine personnel should ride them for the first use, this was announced under the supervision of Lord Ōta Matasuke. These stirrups were said to be the ones that Lord Hōgan (Yoshitsune) used when he rode down at Ichi-no-tani via Tekkai-mine and Hiyodorigoe. On the 5th day, Lord Nobunaga's son, Lord Ochōsen, came to observe. Due to the urgency, only the first race had three delays, and the rest were conducted with only stirrup-rubbing.

Moreover, in the third race, neither the proper drum nor the embankment coordinated. During the investigation, the fourth race's horse entered the barrier early, so the third race's Nakakyō lost. In that case, even the whips did not coordinate properly.

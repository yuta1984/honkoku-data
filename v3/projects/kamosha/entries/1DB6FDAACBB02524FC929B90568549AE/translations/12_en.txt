They were provided. This year, the ashifushi (preliminary event) schedule remained as is, falling on the 5th day.
There is a written record. (Ninth race, right) Kura-no-suke Ujinao, when ascending after the match concluded, pulled his horse southward and jumped over the fence. Soon there was a fall from horse, but
《Marginal note: In the seventh race, the left rider Ujitomo fell from his horse, so the horse was withdrawn, and after the tenth race ended, he returned to the raceground》【Red ink】
it said, but it was not problematic. The gon-hafuri's horse, ridden by the seventh race left (Ujitomo), fell and was withdrawn, and after the tenth race ended, he galloped into the raceground. Jumping over the fence was like a bird. It was Ise-no-kami Jūrō-dono's imperial horse. Called Kojika (young deer). This was after Izumo-no-kami Ujitomo's fall from horse. There was a fight in the raceground. One person from the Kyoto group was wounded. Nevertheless, it ended without serious incident.

Eiroku 2nd year
1. The Kubō's (Shogun's) visit was only on the 1st day. Details omitted below.
1. From the north of the Kawabata sendan to Ashi, it was three horses ridden, but this year it was six horses ridden. This is questionable.
1. The matter of waving the sacred streamers (gohei) on the left and right of the first race is questionable.
　　First race left: Gagaku-no-suke Kagehisa
1. The right sacred streamer being waved by the deputy officials, specifically Minbu-shōyū Yasuhisa, and also being waved from the reserved seating area - this is improper.
1. The matter of the first race right horse not being led to the right barrier, but instead being led under the sugi trees at the sutra hall and then into the river is questionable.

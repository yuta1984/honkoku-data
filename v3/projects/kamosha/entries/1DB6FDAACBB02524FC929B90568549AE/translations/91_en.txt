As the offense was not light, he should have been punished with banishment, but the shrine community
showed leniency, already reducing his punishment by one degree and dismissing him from his position alone.
Under these circumstances, there would be no reason for the horsemen group to further
intercede with the shrine community. Even if there were any petition, it was unanimously decided
that intercession by the senior horsemen would be unnecessary.

On the eighteenth day of the third month of Hōei 3 (1706), there was a meeting, and Rokubei of Tanaka-machi's
petition was again disclosed on this day, but according to the group decision
from August of last year, there would be no further lenient deliberation, and it was declared
to the senior horsemen that their intercession would henceforth be strictly unnecessary.

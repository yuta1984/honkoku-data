Princess Onna-san-no-miya 《Marginal note: My note: Later examining the Seirei diary, she died on the intercalary 4th month, 26th day of Enpō 3. It is clear that horses for guard duty were offered as usual》
　Died on April 26th, Enpō 3 [1675], it appears that horses were
　offered to the Imperial Court office

As stated above, according to what I heard later from Shiaki's account, during the time of Tōshō-gū,
horses were clearly offered as usual, as is clearly
recorded in the Keiba-ki (Horse Racing Records). Specifically, under the riders it states that those were the
horses of Magistrate Itakura-dono who was in charge, and since a request came to copy the Keiba-ki
later in the written record overview, I immediately copied it and sent it to Shiaki.
I also reported this matter to the Densō (imperial messenger) through the temple administrator by letter.

《Marginal note: Examples of postponing the two-day horse racing meet due to ritual defilement》【In red ink】
The Nisui-ki states: On June 1st, Daiei 6, at the hour of the Horse, Kamo horse racing
《Marginal note: My note: Later considering the Nisui-ki, this was for the events of June 11th and 15th》

was arranged for viewing with feet properly positioned 《Marginal note: the ceremonial day was postponed due to ritual defilement》, local people were invited and
there was entertainment with sake at the sutra hall and at Shinkō-in temple 《Marginal note: omitted》
Also, the Shake-ki states: As an example of postponing the May 5th horse racing
during times of court mourning and suspension of duties, in Daiei 6 《Marginal note: Year of the Fire-Dog》, on April 7th,
when Emperor Go-Kashiwabara passed away, the horse racing was postponed and
held from June 1st to the 5th.
Having researched the above precedents, we are now prepared for postponement. These are matters that should be
reviewed at your convenience, so I am writing to you hastily like this.
I should come in person to report this, but since there are no particularly urgent matters,
I am doing it this way. Of course, no reply is necessary. The above.

《Matter of presenting horses during the Shoshi's mourning period》
On the 24th day of the 4th month of Hōei 4th year, on this day, from the residence of Goshoshi Matsudaira Kii-no-kami,
his retainer Fujioka Bunzō came to the residence of the current shrine priest《Tomino Sanni Narihisa》and said:
Yesterday, the 22nd, Kii-no-kami's wife passed away and he is in mourning. The young lord has fifty days of leave.
In that case, what should be done about the horse racing ritual and horse guards? Are there precedents?
Details should be reported. Immediately there was a meeting to
consider precedents. On the same 25th day, the head shrine priest representing all shrines, Tomino Sanni
Narihisa, and the shrine administrator Okamoto Oribenojō, both went to the Goshoshi and
reported precedents in a verbal statement regarding yesterday's inquiry.

Verbal Statement

Regarding this time's inquiry about the manner of presenting御馬 御警固 for horse racing
during Kii-no-kami-sama's mourning period: In the past as well, purification has been
ordered for the personnel and horse guard members before presenting them, so
we humbly request the same procedure this time. Recently, in Jōkyō 3rd year of the Tiger, during Tsuchiya
Sagami-no-kami-sama's mourning period, it was done in the same manner. At that
time as well, when precedents were inquired about, we reported that during Inaba Tango-no-kami-sama's and
Gomi Bizen-no-kami-sama's mourning periods, they were also presented after purification.
The above.

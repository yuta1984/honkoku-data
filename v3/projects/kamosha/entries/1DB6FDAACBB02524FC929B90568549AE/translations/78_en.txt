Left　Tajima-no-kami Kiyotsune《Marginal note: lower left》
3rd race
　　　Right　Izu-no-kami Yasukado

In the 3rd race, the left rider Tajima-no-kami Kiyotsune fell from his horse outside the gate when coming to serve. His younger brother Gendayū therefore changed into ceremonial robes and rode as substitute. However, since there was no notification to the middle lower steps before the service regarding the rider, there was debate at the administrative building. With the consideration that delaying the sacred ritual would be problematic, after further deliberation, the horse race was completed.
《Marginal note: When coming to serve, suddenly riding as substitute, due to no notification about wearing ceremonial robes, became irregular status for three years》
Later, Tajima-no-kami's younger brother Gendayū was given irregular status for three years. This was because there was no notification before the service.

Genroku 3rd year

《Marginal note: While ancient law had none outside the three seats, by judgment eight retainers rode》
1st race right　Sama-no-suke Yasutane　　2nd race left　Sakyō-no-shin Yasushiro
3rd race left　Nuinodono-no-dajō Yasukado　4th race left　Uma-no-jō Yasuai
5th race left　Shuzei-no-jō Yasunaga　　6th race left　Mokutō-no-kami Yasurō
7th race left　Miyamatsu-dayū Yasunori　8th race left　Noto-no-kami Yasuharu

Regarding these eight retainers above, according to ancient law, there was no precedent for those outside the three seats. Therefore, whether it was appropriate to send a messenger from the seating area down to the eighth retainer among the riders was questionable, but the response was that there was no problem. Since there were no other riders available, this was done by judgment. This should not become a repeated precedent.

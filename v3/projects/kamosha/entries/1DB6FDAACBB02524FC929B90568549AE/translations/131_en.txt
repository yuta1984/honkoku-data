One: In the second match, the left side had the first horse and the right side had the pursuing horse. However, only the left side's horse ran while the right side's horse held back, so although there were arguments about the victory, since the cap sounds did not match and the first horse emerged from within, the victory was undecided and it was declared a draw as stated by the lower rank officials. However, Kiyotsuru fell from his horse before the decisive spear moment, resulting in his loss.

The head priest gave no clear response. In that case, there should be no deliberation on victory and defeat.

《Marginal note: Matter of the lower-ranking officials' dispute over the three ceremonial stands for祝義 at the office building》【Written in red】

Under these circumstances, it was proposed that the three ceremonial stands of both lower-ranking officials should be discontinued during the celebratory ceremonies at the office building. At that time, Suemichi said, "This matter has been deliberated since previous years and was decided by the government authorities. It is not something to be requested at this time."

Furthermore, the newly appointed shrine officials and various council members offered no opinions and said nothing - this is said to be the extent of their character according to rumors among the senior and junior shrine families.

In preliminary discussion, it was said: "First, this year is a precious time for various reconstruction projects. This year, there should be deliberation starting from the seating arrangement based on careful consideration. Hereafter, examination should be conducted even more thoroughly."

Following established rules, to Sakuaki of the left lower rank, through an official messenger: "This year there will be deliberation on determining victory and defeat starting from the seating arrangement, so please understand it as such" - this was conveyed through the messenger from the confrontation. At that time, Sakuaki replied: "This is a rare and novel deliberation. For three hundred years, there has been no such precedent. I have no knowledge of Sakuaki creating such a precedent, and if such a law is established, Sakuaki will not serve as a lower-ranking official." This was indeed a most reasonable response.

At that time, despite repeated attempts at resolution by the deputy officials and riders, no decision was reached. Therefore, there was extensive investigation from the evening of the 4th until the morning of the 5th. Among the deputy officials, Yasubetsu (fourth race, left) and Seiki (second race, right) were both riders on the 5th, so Kuranogonjō Yasukata and Genbanojō Ujiyuki became the deputy officials. Therefore, consulting with the head priest, they relied on Sahyōe-no-kami Yasumitsu. Since Yasukata was a deputy administrator and Ujiyuki was a deliberation official, they aligned under the head priest, resulting in such proceedings.

Immediately, Hōken convened a gathering of the seated members and made an announcement as conveyed by the aforementioned messenger. Seiban Sueyoshi was the clear order. At that time, deliberation took place, and Seiban said, "This has become something that is difficult to decide at this point. What would be a reasonable consideration?" At that moment, a young official was additionally assigned from the sixth group as a messenger who said: "We wonder about the propriety of Yasurō riding while in light mourning. Since there was no notification to our group, we roughly heard about and addressed this matter, but there is no precedent for this, and it becoming a first instance would be a difficulty for our group. Therefore, the rider should be replaced. In the current circumstances, regardless of rank, based on reasonable consideration, he should be allowed to ride in that position," and added "this must not become a precedent for the future." At that time, the consensus of the assembly was "This is quite reasonable. In this matter, the judgment of the seated members alone is insufficient. Fortunately, there is a meeting tonight,

so the inner intentions should be inquired." This was announced to the meeting through the administrator. The response was: "The deliberation by the seated members is extremely thorough. This is a matter of precedent. In any case, we believe the ancient laws should not be broken." During this time, the sixth group also notified the riders' side as described above. Also, regarding the notification from the group, through the first rider to Administrator Hōken, they reported: "Should the substitute for someone in light mourning definitely not be allowed? There is also a notification from our group to the pilgrimage lodging." At that time, the seated members also responded in agreement with this matter. Also, to that group: "There has been no precedent since ancient times for substitutes for those in light mourning. Especially since this horse racing is a joyous sacred ritual. Such unlawful acts should not be permitted" was decided by the seated members, and as a response to the group: "In the future, there should be a written record so that there will be no debate about such matters."

1. From around the hour of the horse (noon), there was heavy rain, and the riverbed area flooded with water levels gradually rising

　　Later, when the deputy administrator's officials and horse officials were withdrawing, the bridge became extremely
　　dangerous, so at the main grandstand the shrine officials held a council meeting and decided to expedite the sacred ritual.
　　They nearly decided whether the Shizuhata and the following ten turns should all proceed without any reduction.
　　During the deliberation, they consulted with Left Platform Ōmi-no-kami Tsunetsugu through Tsushima-no-kami Yasunaga,
　　and Tsunetsugu's response was that having no reduction at all
《Marginal note: Due to heavy rain and flooding from the hour of the horse, the first turn was delayed three times, and turns two through ten were each delayed once》【Red ink】
　　would set a questionable precedent for the future, so the first turn should be
　　delayed three times, and turns two through ten should each be delayed once."
　　Based on this input, the decision was made as stated above, and the ritual supervisor, platform officials,
　　and guardians conveyed this message to the mounted participants, and everything concluded without incident.
　　The horse officials withdrew successfully.

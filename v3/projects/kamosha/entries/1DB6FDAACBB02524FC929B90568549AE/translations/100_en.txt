1. Regarding Tanaka-chō Rokubei, who held the Tone position and was permanently dismissed from the riders' group on the 5th day of the 5th month of Hōei 2 due to his outrageous offense against a fellow rider, although he repeatedly made apologies to the riders' group thereafter, because his offense was not light, there had been no discussion of clemency until this year. Due to his self-reflection on his offense and repeated apologies, on the 23rd day of the 12th month of this year, there was a gathering of the riders' group where this matter was disclosed, and since the eighth group members and others had no objections, he was granted clemency.

On the 18th day of the 1st month of Hōei 7, when this matter was disclosed to the entire shrine community as described above, it was decided that since the riders' group had no objections, clemency should be granted. On the same day, Rokubei appeared before the entire riders' group to express his gratitude.

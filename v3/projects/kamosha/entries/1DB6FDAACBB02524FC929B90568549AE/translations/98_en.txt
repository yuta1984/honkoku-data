1. In this year's preliminary horse inspection (ashizoroe), the rider for Horse Bureau Chief Celebrant was Kiyochika, and the rider for Kifune Negi was Hitoki. When these horses were matched in the 9th bout, both were small and it was difficult to perform the three-delay tomoe pattern, and Hitoki fell from his horse. Due to this, from the 2nd day until the 5th day, a request was made to the Horse Bureau and Kifune Negi to replace one horse from the right side among the riders, but this was refused as a second request, so it was left as it was. On the same 5th day, in the 9th bout's horse kicking match, Kiaki had already fallen from his horse. Due to this, there was a meeting among the riders, and for future reference

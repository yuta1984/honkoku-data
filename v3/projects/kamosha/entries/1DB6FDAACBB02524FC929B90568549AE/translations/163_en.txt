First day
　Ten　Shingū Negi　Tsunetame　Lower-lower grade　Iwawaka Dayū Tsunenao

　Deputy Administrator Junior Fourth Rank Lower Grade Zetsuakira　《Marginal note: Supervisor》Yasuhiro Sadaakira
《Marginal note: Riding form extremely unseemly, whip not used, lower-lower grade hair attachment is appropriate, no dismounting so restart not necessary》【Red ink】
1. Shingū Negi rider Tsunenao, during the preliminary run, from around the cherry tree area after whip strike,
   his right leg crossed over to the left side, grasped the front ring of the left saddle and reached the finish line. Due to this,
   while it was determined as lower-lower grade hair attachment, from the main viewing stand, among the chief administrators,
   Kanenao came to the official residence and stated that the aforementioned Shingū Negi's rider's riding form
   was similar to a dismounting, so shouldn't this be a restart?
   In response, the deputy administrator and supervisors replied that the riding form was extremely
   unseemly and no whip was used, therefore it was determined as lower-lower grade hair attachment.
   Since there was no dismounting, a restart was not necessary. This matter was concluded.

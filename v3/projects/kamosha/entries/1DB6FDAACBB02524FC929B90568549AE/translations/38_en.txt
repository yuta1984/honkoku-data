It is said. Also, during times of court mourning and suspension of duties, the horse races at Kamo Shrine on the 1st and 5th days of the 5th month

were postponed. As an example of postponement, the Nisui Records state: "In Daiei 6, year of the fire-dog (1526), on the 7th day of the 4th month, when Emperor Go-Kashiwabara passed away, the horse racing was postponed, and horse racing was held on the 11th and 15th days of the 6th month." From Daiei 6 to Keian 4 is perhaps 128 years.

The deputies were: for the left court rider, Genba-suke in place of Uneme-suke; for the right court rider, Tanba-no-kami in place of Sakyō-shin.

《Marginal note: Yasuhisa's wife suddenly entered the fifty-day mourning period, making it impossible to ride》【Red ink】
For the third race, Uneme-no-jō Yasuhisa had a woman attendant whose mother suddenly died, putting her in a fifty-day mourning period.

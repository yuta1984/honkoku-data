And not a single person fell from their horse. Such a spectacle was an unprecedented event in all of history, etc.
Regarding Kanazu's illegal conduct, the nineteenth person to enter service departed but did not arrive at the office.
Next, after the match, they watched facing toward the right barrier. How should such a new ceremony be regarded?
Therefore, people said "Has the poison medicine worked in reverse?" etc. This was an unprecedented case of no falls
in all of history.

This was due to illegal direct entry. Someone said "This is indeed proper instruction. The third bout's horse - could this be
an error by the deputy?" Remaining silent was the most appropriate response. Therefore, the third bout participant was suddenly
given a difficult task. This lasted about one hour. At that time, both the third and fourth bouts were deliberated upon, etc.

    When emerging in a tomoe pattern, there was insufficient prescribed small movement, creating difficulty for direct entry, so it was declared.
    Made direct entry below and emerged from the wood rather than the prescribed horse. However, "not correcting in direct entry" is
    ancient precedent. Therefore, there was nothing irregular.

for the purpose of informal observation, he made his first appearance. In recent years, the Shoshidai had not made an appearance for a long time,
　　but this year's appearance marks the beginning in recent years, and so forth.

《Marginal note: Matter of whether the horse race should be postponed due to heavy rain on the 4th day》【In red ink】
　　On May 4th there was heavy rain that did not cease even into the night, and due to this, tomorrow the Shoshidai's horses, guards, etc.
　　might have difficulty crossing the river at this location, so for consultation there was a standing meeting
　　of a small assembly that lasted until evening. First, the two representatives within the drawbridge area and their respective attendants would
　　cross the river and lodge at Kubo-midō. Also, the shrine servants of Nishi-Kamo and others
　　would cross the river from this evening and lodge at the designated location, as unanimously decided by the assembly. First, during today,
　　even if it becomes night, the representatives should visit the Shoshidai and
　　inquire about tomorrow's arrangements, which would be appropriate. Regarding this, there are no recent examples of postponing horse races due to rain

《Marginal note: In my opinion, the matter of the Shoshidai's horses being brought out dates from the time when Itakura Suō-no-kami served as Shoshidai》
　　or not. Even if it is an ancient precedent, it was unanimously decided that the representatives should
　　bring written documents to present when inquired about in writing.
　　Due to this, when various people knowledgeable about precedents were
　　consulted, my father-in-law Kiyokiyo came from the council meeting to my place
　　and instructed that if there were examples of postponement due to rain, they should be written out.
　　Naretsunehisa also descended from the council meeting just now to consider precedents, and so forth.
　　I immediately wrote down the precedent I knew on a sheet of paper and entrusted it to Kiyokiyo to submit.
　　That draft is recorded below.
《Marginal note: Document on precedents for postponing horse races on the 5th day due to rain》【In red ink】
　One: The shrine family records state, the Bunmei records state, that the ritual horses of May 5th, Bunmei 9th year,
　　were postponed perhaps due to severe rain, and were performed on the 22nd of the same month. Because the Muromachi lord would
　　observe the event, it was performed on that day.

According to Kyōken, the ranking order was announced on the 11th day of the 3rd month this year, so the lower ranks will also be arranged by ranking from this year. However, for the lower ranks, perhaps from Hōreki 5th year?

One: The lower rank's horseback offering ceremony was conducted according to the rain ceremony format due to rain. Each person took their seat in the sacred tag building【with east as the superior position】, and the horseback offering was performed in the sacred desk building.

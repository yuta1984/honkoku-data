The relevant parties made no notification whatsoever, and later when Shidori replaced his horse, it was done in the same manner with notification only to the deputies. Consequently, among the deputy group, Seifuku came to my residence and inquired about the notification procedures. In response, I replied based on the records left by the late Sankō regarding the notification procedures when the horses of Anshi, Kibune festival deputy officials, and others were replaced on the 4th day of the 5th month of Kanpō 3rd year. The procedure is as follows: when replacing horses, the horse office notifies the riders of that horse and the riders of the opposing horse office, then notifies the deputies. The deputies notify the head priest and nineteen other horse office riders (twenty people in total), as well as the ceremonial officials. However, regarding the twenty riders, the procedure is to first notify the three lead riders and consult with them, and when they acknowledge,

it is not necessary to notify everyone. Regarding the fact that there was no notification from the horse office this time, I would like to make a submission even at a later date to ensure awareness of precedent procedures. Also, regarding the deputies' notification to the riders this time, when they submitted it to the lead riders and made the announcement during assembly at the office building, the riders had various complaints about it.《Marginal note: Diary of Elder Seiashi》

The disturbance was considerable, so on the evening of May 4th, from the shrine to the night duty officer,
the official said: "This year's commotion and blame is as such. If so, then in this horse race meet,
those who should not win shall be made to win, and those who should lose shall not be argued about as losers -
there must be no quarrels at all, and strict restraint is most appropriate. Especially, delaying the sacred ritual
would not be proper. Simply, the essence of swift and peaceful resolution would be best." Therefore,
starting with two horses, there was generally disorder of three horses within the barriers. However, the left horse of the seventh bout's entry into the barriers
and the opportunity to gallop out was very difficult to advance, and after about half an hour the right horse emerged. The left
horse also stood with only the appearance of continuing one or two ken and remained in defeat. After that there were some
brief intervals, and within the nine-nine it was again somewhat urgent. Then on the dawning 6th day, by imperial will, all
shrine family members appeared.

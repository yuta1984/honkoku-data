[Regarding the matter of omitting the small preliminary from the 4th race onward, differing from previous years - crossed out: 1st day, foot selection] 【Written in red ink, but "foot selection" in black】
During the race, Kataoka Negi's horse entered from the second late half, did not perform the small preliminary, and fell at the final turn. Moreover, from this year's 4th race onward, the small preliminary was omitted, which was entirely due to the negligence of the head officials.

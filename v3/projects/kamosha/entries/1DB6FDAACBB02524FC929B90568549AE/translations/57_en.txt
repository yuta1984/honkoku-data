{{Marginal note: Matter of changing horses after passing the nine curves |}}
In the first bout, Lord Nagai Iga-no-kami's horse, a black dappled chestnut, after passing the nine curves near the
Ton Palace grounds, showed strong temperament and appeared as if it would die from exertion, therefore
a substitute horse was used to perform the divine service.

Previously, at one shrine, according to the purport of new regulations, there was a fixed
evaluation regarding court nobles' attendants among the first riders of the current season.
First, the victories and defeats of those at the lower steps were heard and arranged, and with that purport, following the seating
arrangement, there was deliberation by divine messengers regarding the riding attendants. At that time, the riding attendants' reply was:
"We humbly receive the purport of the evaluation messengers. Furthermore, regarding formal ceremonies, we should consult internally with those at the lower steps."

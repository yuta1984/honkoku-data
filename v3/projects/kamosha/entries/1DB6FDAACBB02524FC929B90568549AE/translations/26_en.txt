There were two first-time riders. The remaining one person was determined by age order, so there were two people among the clan members. Therefore, reasoning was given from the clan members to the elder and younger members, and the expenses for Kibune were provided by the clan members. This settled the matter. It rained from morning until evening on the seasonal festival day. The next day, the 6th, there was a flood, and the riders made a pilgrimage to Kibune.

《Marginal note: Since there was one first-time rider short and there were two people among the clan members, the Kibune expenses were provided by the clan members》【Red ink】

《Marginal note: On the 6th day, due to flooding at Kibune, worship was performed from afar at Shiraishi》【Red ink】
Although they went as far as Shiraishi, they performed prostrated worship from there and returned. The celebratory ceremony for Kibune was held at the local government building. Therefore, on the same 17th day, there was a Kibune pilgrimage. The sake for the celebration was provided by the first-time riders. The rice was provided by the main hall. For the Kibune officials, there were gifts from the first-time riders. Since this is a long-standing custom, it is recorded here.

If it would be righteousness, then one should hesitate until the pain subsides a little," and he rose from his seat. At that time,
Kunai-no-shoyu Tamotsu said "All the more so, since it is precedent, wearing purification robes is the appropriate course
of action. It is indeed an opinion that accords with precedent," etc. At that time, the person in purification robes, Yasutak, at Kinoshita
was uncertain whether to mount or not, so he went to Suruga. Especially the usual strategy was certain. At the end of the horse arena,
he fell from his horse, and at the moment of remounting, being somewhat spirited again, it looked dangerous, etc. Therefore, the usual
climb was lacking, and the local people and shrine families were amazed and spoke words of praise. However, Yasutake immediately
boasted of riding in formal attire. The right side did not falter as usual, and it became the right's defeat.

        Left: Nishi-ichi-no-sho Fukuhisa  
    Second bout
        Right: Nuido-no-jo Yasufuku

The left's Fukuhisa tilted the barrier in front of Ton Palace to the east. Because he tightened the right rein,
he leaped over the barrier and galloped in before taking his seat, immediately falling from his horse. The right's horse also entered following, but
did not fall {{Marginal note: At that time did not mount immediately | This being heartless mockery}}. At that time, he rose from his seated position and wandered about, standing and resting beside. Then after a while, the left
withdrew to the west and immediately galloped together. Although the right was said to follow out, he was several intervals late. At that time, regarding the defeat,
a messenger was sent to the right's position below the steps. The reply was "It is rare for one who falls from his horse within the barrier to win.
I myself should not lose," etc. At that time, there was some dispute but it ended peacefully.

        Left: Izumo-no-kami Kiyoya
    Third bout
        Right: Chikara-no-suke Yasudai

In the third bout, although the left departed too early, he fell from his horse after passing the trees slightly. This was because it was his first ride.
He was unharmed. The right was extremely late.

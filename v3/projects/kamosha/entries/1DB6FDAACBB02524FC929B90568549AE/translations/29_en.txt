《Marginal note: The matter of the tenth match horse substitution proceeding without notification》【Red ink】
According to the Shigemura Record, at the horse racing meet on the fifth day of the fifth month of Kan'ei 6th year, the shrine priest's tenth match horse was substituted, but there was no notification from the shrine priest. However, the ujibito (shrine parishioners) said that "the tenth match horse was substituted," and asked the deputy officials, "Why was there no notification to the riders as well?" The deputy officials replied, "If there is notification from the horse office to the deputy officials, then the deputy officials should notify the riders at that time." There was no precedent for deputy officials to inquire at the horse office, so the deputy officials paid no attention to whether it happened or not. Also regarding shrine affairs, if the deputy officials did not come to inquire, nothing should be said, so this matter also went without discussion, and the ritual was completed by leading out the horses.

Also, regarding the greetings by the riders after the competition finished at the riding ground:
The previous practice appeared to be a gesture of respect toward the shrine priest, but from this year, they went around to the west to worship at the place where the sacred spears stand in the sand, and to the shrine priest they simply gave eye contact while standing.

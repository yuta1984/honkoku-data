　　　　To the Magistrate's Office

　When the above was presented, [we were told] to still wait and see the situation until the 5th hour (around 8 AM) tomorrow, and to report on the circumstances.
　[We were told] that depending on the situation at that time, there would be consideration,
　and we humbly acknowledged this instruction and withdrew.
　On the 5th day it was clear. There had been heavy rain last night, but it stopped after midnight and did not fall until this morning.
　During this time the river water did not rise significantly, it became clear, and the shrine greatly rejoiced.
　From early morning, villagers and the river magistrate went out to the sacred garden to have a bridge erected.
　Accordingly, the two representatives went to the military magistrate's office, and since it had cleared up,
　reported that a bridge had been erected, and requested that the horses and guards be sent out
　around noon, then withdrew, and so forth. However, the shrine servants also could not cross last night, and today
　waited for the bridge to be erected before crossing the river to come, so this morning's Shinto ritual was delayed.

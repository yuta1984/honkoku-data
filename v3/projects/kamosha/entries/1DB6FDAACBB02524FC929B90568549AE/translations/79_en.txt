This horse racing record was written by Shinchoku《Marginal note: Son of Chikachoku. Died on the 21st day of the 11th month of Meireki 1st year, aged 54》from Genna 1st year to Meireki 1st year, and from Meireki 2nd year to Genroku 3rd year by Shinchoku's eldest son Junior Fifth Rank Lower Takachoku《Marginal note: Died on the 82nd day of Genroku 6th year, aged 51》, who continued writing based on a book possessed by Junior Fourth Rank Lower Sueyoshi. The original manuscript in Shinchoku's own hand is now possessed by Konosuke-dayū Hiroaki, the third son of Imasuaki, so I earnestly requested to make a copy. However, the records of horse racing victories, defeats, and irregular incidents from Meireki 2nd year onward are quite unclear in their literary meaning, but I have copied and preserved them as they appear in the original document.

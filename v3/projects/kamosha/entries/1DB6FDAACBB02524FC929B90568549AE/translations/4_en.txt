Stand them up. Cross through the interior of Uchi (Raka), with the first on the left-north, and the right also with the first to the north.
For mounting, stand the horses.
1. For the first horse race, enter the horse from the left. For the second, enter the horse from the right. From the third onward, depending on the contest results, enter the horse from the losing side. Also, for the tenth horse race, enter the horse from the left.
1. Up to the first five races there are three thousand (chi). From the sixth race onward, only stirrup rubbing.
1. Contest disputes are matters before the six silks are hung. Restrain speech. However, also inquire well about the drums. Observe closely the whips of the inner horses.

1. If the imperial horse is replaced with anything, it becomes the first right contest rider. If the first left superior horse contest rider is replaced, it is for the negi (shrine priest) faction horse to be ridden. The hafuri (ritual officiant) faction horse is not to be ridden. The first left does not use a whip, and the right also does not raise a whip from the beginning when setting the horse in motion.
1. Five pine trees below the steps - there is a return to the imperial seat, so have them stand. Also, after the seventh race, the pines are arranged.
　　　Before Kiyoshige's additional investigation and the hoko spear revival, the pines were erected.
1. When the attendants below the steps - whether shoshi-dayū, bettō-dayū, or mokudai - go to the riders, first they must call for the wearing of their master's ritual white garments and make the announcement. Then the riders must dismount from their stools. If not done this way, the announcement is not made.

This was rumored to be an unprecedented breaking of shrine law, and it was mocked that henceforth these two men and Yasumitsu would become great enemies within the clan members. There is a record by Ujinawa as a rough account for future generations.

On the 5th, the debate between the lower-ranking officials and the head priest over victory and defeat was a serious matter. The 140 people and young members had no unity at all, and it was decided that thorough investigation must be conducted. With desperate determination, the clan members made up their minds at that moment. In the horse exit area within the barriers, many middle-aged and young members gathered, and around both lower-ranking officials' areas as well, about twenty or more young members each gathered, deciding that discussion should take place, and everyone assembled.

However, from the head priest's seating, not a single word of guidance regarding victory and defeat was spoken - everything was under the direction of the lower-ranking officials.

《Marginal note: Matter of Suemichi serving as advisor to the left lower-ranking official》【Written in red】

The advisor was Mokugon-no-jō Suemichi. It concluded peacefully, which was precious. Then the head priest took his seat in the office building and exchanged greetings with both lower-ranking officials. The head priest and the three lower-ranking officials held a sacred feast with three ceremonial stands as in previous generations. Especially, the head priest addressed the lower-ranking officials with various greetings, and cups were passed around with much drinking. "Excellent, excellent, we want such occasions in the future" - this is what people are saying.

This section is added from Sueyoshi's private daily records.
○ Suemichi's record is also detailed. I sat as the left lower-ranking official and added guidance, as observed.

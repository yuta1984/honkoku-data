[Sueyoshi] went as a representative to offer condolences and inquired about the investigation, saying "This is a matter from before. Once one has taken a seat, not rising from that seat is today's precedent. Therefore, there is no example of this in ancient or modern times." When this was said, Okihisa put away the viewing box. However, since Okihisa's argument was improper, he did not voice his objection and the matter was settled as it was. Since this appeared unseemly, his son Shuri-dayū Takehira offered his opinion, and they immediately withdrew together.
Such matters have been added in writing for future generations. Later it was heard that Matsushita Nobuhisa angrily declared, "To propose unprecedented matters without reason is beyond all bounds."
Today, Nobuhisa also did not take his seat in the government building, calling it unlawful.

Hōreki 10th year
On the 1st day around the inu hour, a fire broke out from a rotted large cedar tree on the west side of Babasaki, so everyone quickly rushed out with large drums and bells to extinguish it, but since it was difficult to put out, the cedar tree was cut down and the fire was finally extinguished. It was an extraordinary commotion. This matter was also reported to the magistrate's office the following day.

《Marginal note: Since competition between the same school could not take place, deputy representatives from each side took turns riding》【Red ink notation】

1. When each jockey assembled at the office building, Atsuaki of the sixth position left stated that Hiroyuki of the sixth position right was ill, so Yoaki would serve as his deputy. In that case, competition between the same school would not be feasible. Yoaki stated that while competition between the same school would indeed be difficult to achieve, although there are ancient precedents, there should be no problem with a substitute representative, and since there are recent precedents, he would serve as deputy. There were various arguments back and forth, but since there were recent precedents, everyone agreed that it would be best to proceed with discretion and continue the service as planned. However, since Atsuaki would not consent, there was no choice. Since this would cause the divine service to be delayed, they agreed to today's deputy participation, but with the understanding that there should be further substitutions during the competition. When this matter was discussed with Unkyu, the deputy for Yasukado of the second position right, he immediately agreed. During the messenger duties, Yoaki would serve as deputy for the second position right, and Unkyu would serve as deputy for the sixth position right.

《Marginal note: The order of the first horse and pursuit horse was confused, so they finished with only small movements, completed the run, dismounted and ascended to the imperial pavilion, and after untying the sleeve cords, they had to enter again》【Red ink】
　　　During the right second turn, the riders and the exit supervisors were not attentive,
　　　so the manor-lower entered first within the barrier with small movements and below, the manor-upper ran as the first horse and finished,
　　　then dismounted and ascended to the imperial pavilion, and after untying the sleeve cords, they entered again
　　　and ran directly

《Marginal note: Matter of the right side approaching the steps from within the barrier regarding the left side's sitting defeat》【Red ink】
　　The left side released their grip and immediately pulled away in a curve, resulting in a sitting defeat. However, despite being the left side,
　　since it was a matter of the exit, the right side approached the steps from within the barrier and questioned the details.
　　They responded, but after releasing their grip during the vocal competition and helmet encounter, it was deemed their own affair and was stopped.

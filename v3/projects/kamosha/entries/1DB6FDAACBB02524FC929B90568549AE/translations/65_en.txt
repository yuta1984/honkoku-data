This was completed. Then, the jockeys celebrated at the imiko-ya (purification hut) with what they called the ceremonial meal of Kifune. This is recorded in detail to serve as an example for future generations.

After the losing horse racing ritual ended, taking seats in the office building was according to ancient and modern shrine law, etc.

In the 5th month of Enpō 4 (1676), during the horse racing gathering, heavy rain fell. After the ritual ended, when the jockeys and the lower-ranking people took their seats in the office building, Nishiichishō Fukuhisa, one of the aforementioned jockeys, did not take his seat. Therefore, Shōhei conducted an investigation and declared that this was against ancient and modern propriety. The lower-ranking jockeys also agreed, saying "Indeed so," so they called out the lower-ranking shoshi (shrine official) and said: "Fukuhisa's departure is most irregular. He should definitely appear and take his seat." This was announced. They said that two jinjin (shrine attendants) should be dispatched immediately. The shoshi understood and called out the jinrin, instructing them about the irregularity. The shoshi privately mediated, saying: "This is unprecedented, unheard of in previous generations. This is the beginning of a precedent. He must attend." This was strictly announced. The jinrin acknowledged and attended.

Also, in addition to wearing pure robes from the beginning, Robuku-dayū Kiyotsune and Sen'ya-jin-dayū Yasunori participated. In response, they said: "We feel suddenly unwell, so we are withdrawing," etc. This was unprecedented misconduct, unheard of in previous generations. There will likely be further incidents. Therefore, this is recorded.

1. When Kibune negi rider Chiyozuru-dayū was performing the preliminary run, [the horse] stopped in front of the town magistrate's
　　viewing stand. Though it appeared to be a situation requiring re-entry and [the horse] was led down to the exit,
　　it was deemed a mistake and [the rider] mounted and rode up again.

1. In the fourth turn, the trailing horse (Kiyotsugu) galloped through, and the leading horse (Ujiso) stopped below the imperial messenger's viewing stand.
　　From there, when [the rider] mounted up, Deputy Administrator Guardian Ujito went
　　to where the course passed and ordered both riders that they should perform re-entry.
　　Accordingly, they rode down to the exit, but while the exit supervisor and general viewing stands
　　were deliberating with various opinions, Guardian Ujito again came to the
　　exit and stated, "There was some error just now, but re-entry is not necessary;
　　you should ride up." Therefore, they rode up without performing re-entry.

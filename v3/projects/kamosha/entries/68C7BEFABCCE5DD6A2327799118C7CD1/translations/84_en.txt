○Jōwa 4th year (1348), May 6th: Ten rounds of horse racing were held at the shrine grounds' horse track, following the same format as the ceremonial day. The costumes were also the same as on the ceremonial day. This was to fulfill a vow made by the shrine people, a vow made when Ōraiden Kan fell from his horse during the Genkō era. The participation of shrine officials was at their discretion. The costume was court dress (ho'i). For the reward ceremony, there were six officials, two or more tsuzumi-shōko musicians, and eight people selected from among the shrine people. They wore formal court dress (sokutai).

【Running from the second round with one delay - Added by Tsunekazu】
One: Bunka 8th year (1811), May 5th: Due to heavy rain and flooding, they were about to remove the bridge, so the ritual was hurried. Only the first round ran with three delays, while from the second to tenth rounds ran with one delay. This was an unprecedented example. The horse racing of Tenshō 2nd year - can this be called a precedent?
　　However, the ceremony magistrate requested to the lower steps left side Tsunetsugu that rounds after the first should proceed without any delays, but Tsunetsugu replied that since there would be no proper procedure in that case, it would be better to have at least one delay before proceeding with the rounds. Based on this response, the above decision was made, and the ceremony magistrate conveyed this decision to the riders.

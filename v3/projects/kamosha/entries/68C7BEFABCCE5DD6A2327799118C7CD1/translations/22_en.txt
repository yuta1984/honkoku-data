Using the wands in groups of six times six to represent the 360 days and employing the five grains—whether this is for prayers for the fulfillment of the five grains needs to be investigated.

One, during Shinto rituals, tabi (split-toe socks) are not worn. When wearing sokutai (court dress) or ikan (court cap and robe), wearing shitauzu (court socks) is naturally required, but this practice is inconvenient for the warrior class.

Of course, during military formations and horse riding, waraji (straw sandals) are worn, so from the Ōnin era onward, the warrior class named them "tabi" and split the big toe area to use them exclusively.

One, during Shinto rituals, there are taboo words for curtains. For viewing curtains, one says "hold" instead of other terms; "raising up" is called "shioru," and "setting aside" is called "store." For ship curtains, one says "make run"; for ally curtains one says "strike," and for enemy ones "pull." Also, for ceremonial curtains one says "stretch," and in general, one must not say "depart" or "fold."

Now, regarding the matter of horse racing ceremonies, during the reign of the 73rd Human Emperor, Emperor Horikawa, an imperial vow was made, and horse racing was first conducted at Kamo in Kanji 7 (1093 CE, year of Mizunoto-Tori) as prayers for peace throughout the realm and abundant harvests《At this time, there were five races》. Following this tradition, the ceremony has continued annually with ten horse races, carrying on the legacy of the ancient ceremonies that were once held at the Butokuden Hall within the Imperial Palace.

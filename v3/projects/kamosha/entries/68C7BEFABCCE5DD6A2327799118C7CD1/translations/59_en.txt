1. Third match: Right side's lead horse was Tsuneuji, left side was Kyōken representing Yasanobu. Subsequently, the left side lost position. They were attached to the right side's lower platform, but since the voices did not match, it was said that they should restart. However, since the voices matched and the crown alignment was also good, it was declared that Tsuneuji won. This led to a dispute, and since the rider said they should inquire with the exit supervisors, they inquired from the lower platform. Although they said that the voice was appropriate and the crown alignment was good, confirming the left side's loss of position, the left rider kept making various arguments, leading to deliberation. The left and right lower platform supervisors gradually spoke of reconciliation and said they should restart, but this was not accepted, and since the time had become extremely late,

When they inquired with the seated officials, they said that from this point no victory or defeat could be seen, and moreover, while victory or defeat did not matter, since the right side was direct participation and the left side was substitute riding, it would be appropriate for the left side to withdraw.

1. Second match: Left side's Sagami-no-kami Mitsaaki, first generation of the Kinori lineage, showed no opponent's courtesy. The right side Kaneta won. However, the absence of opponent's courtesy was a first precedent.

1. Enkyō 5th year (1748), 5th month, 3rd day
The exit supervisor came and said that according to annual custom, victory should be decided by two small gallops, so this was acknowledged. Additionally, according to annual custom, it should end with three small gallops, but if abbreviated, it should be done with one small gallop as in previous years, and everything should be done according to established precedent.

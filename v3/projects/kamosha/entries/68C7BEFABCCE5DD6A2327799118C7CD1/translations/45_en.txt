The ceremonial methods and riding forms of horse racing are not exclusive to Kamo horse racing, but date back to ancient times when horse racing was conducted at the Butokuden (Hall of Military Virtue) in the imperial palace, as well as at two locations: what is now Ichijo-Nishino-toin (formerly called the Sakon horse grounds) and what is now Ichijo-Omiya (formerly called the Ukon horse grounds). The ceremonial methods and riding forms used during horse racing and mounted archery at these locations were the same, and all of these have been transmitted to Kamo shrine and continue to be practiced to this day. These ceremonial methods are ultimately intended to ensure that horses and riders do not separate from each other, staying close together without anyone breaking away from the group, as has been passed down through tradition. The concepts of "slow path" and "fast path" that are commonly mentioned are also derived from these traditional forms.

This running horse ceremony began during the 27th year of the reign of the 30th human emperor, Shikishima-no-miya (referring to Emperor Kinmei), when an imperial edict was issued. An auspicious day in the fourth month was chosen to first conduct this festival, during which horses were run to pray for peace throughout the realm and abundant harvests of the five grains.

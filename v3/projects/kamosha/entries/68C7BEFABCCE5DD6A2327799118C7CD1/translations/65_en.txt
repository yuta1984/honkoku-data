For those who die on the ninth day, travel fields and assistance rice shall not be granted.

1. The twenty jockeys for horse racing shall be appointed as in previous years, and two riders shall participate each following period. Even if arrangements prove difficult, this matter should not be brought before the general assembly.

1. Regarding hiring the aforementioned jockeys as substitutes for first-time riders, this is strictly prohibited. Particularly in recent years, as riders have been participating out of proper order, this creates improper situations. Therefore, from now on, there shall be no more "flying riders" (emergency substitutes), but substitutes for first-time riders may participate.

The above articles have been determined through unanimous consultation of all elders and youth.

As above　　　　　　　Administrator

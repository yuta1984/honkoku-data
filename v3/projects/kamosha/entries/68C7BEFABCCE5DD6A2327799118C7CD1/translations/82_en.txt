Both men were granted the fifteen-year tribute (毛).

One: Jōō 2nd year (1653), May 5th
　　　Left: Uneme-no-suke Hoshin
　Second round
　　　Right: Ukon-no-shōgen Chikahisa

【Receiving salary reward on foot】
Both left and right riders fell from their horses. Chikahisa's horse owner became angry and led the horse away, so they had to receive their salary rewards on foot. This was said to be unprecedented.

【Losing and still proceeding to the temporary shrine】
One: Meireki 3rd year (1657), May 5th, Tōkoku-ji
　　　Left: Hyōbu-gon-no-shōsuke Kiyomura
　Fourth round
　　　Right: Zusho-no-suke Yasutake

Because Yasutake suffered a great defeat, he held down his reward silk and did not wear it. However, his relatives appealed to both left and right sides at the base of the stairs, saying that he should wear the reward while not losing, but this was not granted. Nevertheless, he forcibly proceeded to the temporary shrine and took his seat in the administrative building. This was said to be an unprecedented misconduct.

【Crown damage incident】
One: Tenna 3rd year (1683), May 5th
　　　Left: Takumi-no-suke Takehira
　First round
　　　Right: Izumi-no-kami Sadahisa

The left rider used Lord Inaba Tango-no-kami's horse. Takehira fell at a small embankment and was thrown from his horse. Since his crown was damaged and unusable, he wore a tate-eboshi (standing court cap). Everyone mocked him, saying it was against precedent.

【Red annotation】My humble opinion: There is precedent (Kenpō 5th year, Yorimitsu). When divine services face delays after beginning, temporary use of a hakutei eboshi (white servant's cap) would be appropriate.

Hōei 3rd year (1706), May 5th: Third round right, Kurando-no-kami Kiyofumi fell and damaged his crown. It is unknown what replacement was used.

One: The procedures for presentations before the deity and at the administrative building were the same as for the wood construction ceremony. However, this time there was a change: due to the reconstruction of the second torii gate, they proceeded from the western side path of the torii to the bridge hall, completed the rituals at the bridge hall, then proceeded to the divine presence. Since the Jade Bridge was under construction, they proceeded from the connecting hall to the tower gate.
　When entering, the steward informed the imperial messenger of these arrangements for their understanding. Everything else followed the standard procedures for the wood construction ceremony, so details are omitted.

One: The catalog sent to the imperial messenger and deputy at the administrative building during the wood construction ceremony was written vertically.
　During the Shōtoku and Kanpō eras, folded paper was used, but this time it was changed, with the sword catalog written on folded paper.
　The record: Medium-thick folded paper

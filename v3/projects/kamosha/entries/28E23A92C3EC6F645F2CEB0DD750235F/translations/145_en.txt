Memorandum of oral statement

Regarding the seating arrangements for the magistrate and officials during the main shrine's pillar-raising ceremony, according to precedent, white curtains are hung in the record hall with armrests or thin mats set up. For this occasion as well, we humbly believe the same arrangements should be made. Earlier, there was an inquiry about setting up the aforementioned seating area in the prayer hall, but ordinarily, not to mention during construction work, there is no precedent for seating arrangements or divine worship ceremonies in such a difficult location to set up. Since it is customary to set everything up uniformly in the record hall, we humbly wish to proceed in the same manner this time as well. Therefore, we submit this matter. The above.

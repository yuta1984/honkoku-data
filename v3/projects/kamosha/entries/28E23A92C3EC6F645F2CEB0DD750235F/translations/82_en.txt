　One: During the Shōtoku era, we brought the head representative of our shrine and went to express gratitude for the imperial permission. The oral imperial decree was bestowed on the same day. Both the regent families and the military imperial transmitters brought their representatives to express gratitude in the same manner as the shrine families. This appears in the shrine records as stated above. No records can be found regarding other detailed ceremonies. The above.
　　　　　Third month of the year of the Rooster　　　　　　　Kamo Shrine Community

Around the hour of the Monkey, head representative Yasuhisa Suenaga returned home and reported as follows: Since blacksmith Fujiwara Sadatsugu Izumi-no-daijo received the imperial decree last night, we brought him to first visit Magistrate Ben-dono to express gratitude. We apologized for the delay in expressing gratitude due to flooding since yesterday, and immediately presented fifty kan of official money and a two-fan box (katakii-style) to the assistant. However, Izumi-no-daijo wore a plain jacket with a short sword at his side. We also presented a separate document we had researched from shrine records regarding precedents for blacksmiths and gratitude ceremonies. We were told to perform gratitude ceremonies elsewhere according to precedent before returning, so we then expressed gratitude to the Imperial Transmitter, presented one hundred pieces of bronze, and submitted a two-fan case to the assistant. Then, since the Prince Regent's Assistant, Left Minister's Assistant, Right Minister's Assistant, Interior Minister's Assistant, and the current military imperial transmitters had gone to the Kantō region and

　were absent, we expressed gratitude by letter to the senior court nobles Kushige-dono, Madenokōji-dono, and others. However, regarding Izumi, he was invited to a corner of the entrance area by the Imperial Transmitter, Magistrate, and others, where two head representatives stepped forward before the intermediary and stated that Izumi-no-daijo had received the imperial decree last night and was brought to express gratitude.

　When we visited the Magistrate again, we were told that today there would be an imperial inquiry and directive. We sent this message to the shrine community by express messenger, telling the head representatives to wait at the intermediate lodging, and since the method of delivering the oral imperial decree regarding the blacksmith was unclear, we were told to have him wait first. So we waited at the intermediate lodging. Later, news came to the intermediate lodging about the imperial decree for those applying for court rank, so we all went to express gratitude. At this time, regarding the blacksmith as well, it was announced that the oral imperial decree would be bestowed at the Imperial Transmitter's office at the hour of the Snake on the coming twenty-second day.

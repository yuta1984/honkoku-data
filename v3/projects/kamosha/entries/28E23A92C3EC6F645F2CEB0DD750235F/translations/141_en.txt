Article 1: Today when the main hall's old building was to be moved, it was said that Kamo laborers would not be useful, so initially they began pulling without using Kamo laborers, but since the hall showed no signs of movement at all, suddenly there was an earnest request from the assistance team regarding borrowing workers from the Repair Office, and due to this pressing situation, three day-laborers from the Repair Office were dispatched, whereupon movement was finally visible. Due to this, another three men, totaling six Kamo workers, joined in, and together with the assistance team's day-laborers using levers to push and pry, from the upper part of the hour of the Sheep to the upper part of the hour of the Monkey, for about one hour, without delay they pulled it to the vicinity of the rear earthen wall, positioning it alongside the temporary hall's old building.

However, unlike in the Kanpō era, no ropes were attached to the main body of the hall, but [logs] were rolled in and laid under the hall's foundation timber.

Article 1: For the shrine direction: three vessels, pillow wood, bridge timber without knots, one chō of wood measuring one ken in length, three sun five bu in width, and two sun nine bu [in thickness] was earnestly requested and procured from the timber contractor.

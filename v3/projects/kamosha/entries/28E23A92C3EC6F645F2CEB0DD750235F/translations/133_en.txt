1. The imperial messenger ceremony was conducted as in previous visits, so the details are omitted. What differed this time was that when proceeding to the administrative building, since the torii gate near Nara Shrine was under repair, they took a detour via the lower cut path.

The viewing at the sacred archive building and the serving of cold sake for the divine offering banquet followed precedent

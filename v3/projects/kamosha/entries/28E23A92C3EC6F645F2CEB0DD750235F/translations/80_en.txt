Item: Around past the hour of Saru (after 4-5 PM), a letter arrived from Imperial Commissioner Hamuro Ben-dono to Matsushita Sanii. Its contents were as follows:
　　There is an urgent matter requiring attention, so Okamoto Sanii-dono should
　　immediately proceed to the Hi-kurōdo entrance. I hereby inform you. Above.
　　　　March 15th　　　　　　　　Hamuro-dono
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Secretary
　　　　　Matsushita Sanii-sama
　Today, since Okamoto Sanii Yasuaki was attending duties at Kifune for construction matters, after consultation with the duty officials, it was deemed appropriate for Yasurei to appear, so he immediately went to the Hi-kurōdo entrance.

Item: Fellow official Gisuke brought back Yasurei's letter. If it was good news, a small meeting should be held. Around the hour of I (10 PM-12 AM), Yasurei returned home and reported: Tonight, summoned by the Imperial Commissioner, he went to the Hi-kurōdo entrance where the Imperial Messenger and Commissioner were seated together and conveyed that there were matters to inquire about privately with Okamoto Sanii, but since he was on duty at the boats, you came instead. The matter to be inquired about was whether it would be acceptable to erect pillars at Kifune before the temporary relocation, and since there is also coordination with Shimozuru regarding the temporary relocation matter, although they intended to consult with Sanii about issuing this written directive, since time is running short and delay is impossible, it will be announced tonight.

　Although the representative should have been summoned, it will be conveyed to you. What is to be announced is:
　The matter of imperial permission for blacksmith Izumi Daijō. Since there is no precedent for this matter, it is treated the same as shrine families. When asked if this differs from shrine families, he replied that he understood it to be the same as shrine families, but would consider further and report back. Although Izumi should have been brought along tonight to perform courtesy visits, he reported that the bridge was unreliable due to flooding, so it was decided that since it was due to morning floods that caused the current situation, he would visit early tomorrow morning and at that time request the schedule and report on the precedents, and he returned home with reverence, etc.
　The copy of the written directive given during the meeting between the Imperial Messenger and Commissioner is as follows:
　　　　Gonden pillar erection
　　　　　March 19th
　　　　Same, ridge beam raising
　　　　　April 27th
　　　Right, schedule determined: March 18th, hour of Tatsu
　　　Same day: Imperial edict messenger's visit

4th day (Kanoto-Ushi), clear
1. Today is the wood construction commencement ceremony of our shrine. Around the hour of the Snake, the morning offerings for the outer sanctuaries of the main shrine, subsidiary shrines, and branch shrines were presented. For the main shrine, the on-duty shrine official Assistant Negi Yasuhisa; for subsidiary shrines, the duty group (except Kifune, which has daily service); for small shrines, Acting Shrine Administrator Sueyoshi (wearing court cap and robe). However, for the Ota, Nara, and Sawada clan deities as well as branch shrines, both morning and evening divine offerings were prepared together in one place before the wood construction commencement.

1. Offerings of rice (two portions), salted shellfish in high piles (two), rolled dried squid in high piles (two), Azumi River fish (one) in high pile (one) were prepared as additional divine offerings and sent to the construction magistrates.

1. The shrine attendants made announcements three times (specifically to the twenty-one shrine officials). At this time, the large drum was struck once, at the early part of the hour of the Sheep. Therefore, the shrine officials and other various functionaries assembled at the council hall.

1. Before the service began, three sacred timber logs that were in front of the second torii were transported to the shrine precincts. This work was done by twelve laborers (all wearing white court dress; as the logs were extremely heavy and could not be carried by hand, they used poles from offering boxes to carry them). The treasurer, wearing plain white vestments, placed his hands on the sacred timber, while shrine attendants went ahead announcing the procession. The sacred timber was placed in front of the sacred mat house (with sakaki branches spread beneath in three places; specifically using the sakaki from the shrine attendants' procession). These sacred timbers were purified by the shrine attendants at the sacred purification river.

1. After the hour of the Sheep, everyone took their positions and the procession was as follows:
Twenty-one shrine attendants leading (but since three were leading the sacred forest timber, there were eighteen), followed by Chief Priest Hirohisa (wearing hunting robes and plain garments, with one person in court dress, one in plain vestments, two commoners carrying umbrella and shoes, etc.), Head Priest Kaneyasu, Administrative Officer (Deputy Yasuhiro), Deputy Administrator (Deputy Fūsei), etc. (wearing pure vestments and court dress) in attendance, with other shrine officials (each in hunting robes and plain garments) and below following in procession. They entered through the first torii, passed through the second torii, the western bamboo corridor of the bridge hall, the Tama Bridge, etc., entered through the tower gate and middle gate, and took their seats before the deity (Negi section at the transparent corridor, Hafuri section at the eastern crossing hall).
(However, in previous years, the Hafuri section entered through the Kataoka Provisional Hall via the New Shrine Gate and Chinese Gate to be seated in the Hafuri crossing hall, but because many common people crowded in and it became difficult to clear them away suddenly, it was decided by group consultation that the Hafuri section should also go together with the Negi section, cross the Tama Bridge, enter through the tower middle gate, and reach the Hafuri crossing hall from in front of the deity.)
The construction site magistrate took his seat under the southern eaves of the prayer hall (on a round mat at the southeast corner, facing west).
The blacksmiths, carpenters, and cypress bark craftsmen lined up in front of the Haji-no-o Shrine (facing west with the south as the upper position).
Next, the construction magistrate took his seat in the sacred mat house.

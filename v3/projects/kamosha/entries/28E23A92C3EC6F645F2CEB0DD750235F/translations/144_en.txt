On the day itself, early in the morning, when sacred offerings are presented at the outer sanctuary of the main shrine's auxiliary hall and subsidiary shrines, court musicians perform music.

Before the appointed time, the shrine priests and deputy shrine administrators (each in court dress), the construction supervisor (in hunting dress), and the head temple administrators' representatives (each in purification robes) gather at the council hall (with shrine servants serving as guides three times). The designated craftsmen (in purification robes and hemp formal wear) also assemble.

When the appointed time arrives, the shrine priests and others proceed to the shrine precincts, entering through the first torii to the second torii, crossing the western bamboo bridge of the bridge hall and then the jewel bridge, and entering through the tower gate and middle gate.

Next, the shrine priests and deputy administrators take their seats in the corridor hall. The construction supervisor takes his seat in the upper courtyard within Hirajū Gate. The construction magistrate takes his seat in the record hall. Worshipping parishioners gather in the feast hall. The head carpenter and other designated craftsmen sit in rows near Haji-no-o Shrine.

Next, the designated craftsmen (wearing hemp formal wear) advance to the front of the main shrine's foundation timbers and erect pillars (numbering ten), then return to their seats upon completion.

Next, the head carpenter and head master builder advance to the western pillar base and perform a bow. Prior to this, two boards and cypress leaves are laid out on the east and west sides above the foundation timbers (set up by the construction office).

Next, one attendant (in hemp formal wear) brings forward the sacred offering box and hands it to the head master builder. The head master builder receives it and passes it to the head carpenter. The head carpenter holds it up and offers it upon the cypress leaves.

Next, one attendant brings forward a sake vessel and hands it to the head master builder. The head master builder receives it and passes it to the head carpenter. The head carpenter fills the earthenware vessels of the offering box and makes the offering. During this time, one attendant brings forward a sake pot and hands it to the head master builder. When the head master builder takes it and adds it to the sake vessel, the assistant head carpenter makes offerings at the eastern pillar base. This ceremony is the same as that of the head carpenter. At this time, the court musicians perform music.

Next, the head carpenter and assistant head carpenter recite ritual prayers at the left and right pillar bases, and upon completion, return to their seats.

Next, the head and assistant master builders, along with the attendants, advance to the eastern and western pillar bases, remove the offerings, and withdraw.

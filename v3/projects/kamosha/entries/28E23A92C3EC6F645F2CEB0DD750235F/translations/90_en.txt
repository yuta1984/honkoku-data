20th day (Hinoe-Inu) Clear weather
One: After the evening lighting, Gōkyū, Yasuaki, Yasudo, Kanetame (temple administrator), Kiē (administrative officer), Kaneko (meeting place), and Moriaki assembled. The purpose was that today, summoned by Lord Kushige Dainagon, Yasuaki went to the Non-Kurōdo entrance after the noon hour, had an audience, and returned home at evening. According to Yasuaki's report, today he went to the Non-Kurōdo entrance and in the audience with the imperial messenger relay official, it was said: "Before the main shrine's temporary relocation, there will be pillar-raising at the inner shrine - will there be any obstacles? On the 15th, after a general investigation, we wished to issue orders, but since Kifune is to participate, while discussing various matters, it might also interfere with the temporary shrine pillar-raising. To the representative Yasurei,
as the shrine's general representative, instructions were given regarding the timing." In response: "Regarding matters conveyed through military construction arrangements, since timing has been announced from the imperial palace, there are no obstacles within the shrine community," but then it was said "Hereafter, written instructions for military formations will be provided. Is this arrangement acceptable?" Therefore, copies will be made and communicated to the shrine community, then coordinated with the military authorities before reporting back. Additionally, regarding Kanpō, it was understood to be seven military formations, but according to this document it would become eight formations. When the Kanpō military formation records were examined, it appeared to show eight formations, so returning to coordinate within the shrine community and then communicating the written instructions to military authorities for response. Next, the imperial messenger relay official said: "Generally, one shrine, one formation is a weighty matter. According to what the shrine community submitted recently, having Kifune attached to a formation seems questionable." Regarding Kifune, since it is an exceptional shrine, by special consideration it will be made a separate formation. The shrine community had no choice but to petition the military authorities for a five-article single formation arrangement. Regarding Kataoka, it cannot be made a separate formation and follows precedent.

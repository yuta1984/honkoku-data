Vice-official Motomune (in court dress), ritual coordinator Toshiuji (in purification robes), one sword bearer holding sacred offerings, one shrine servant, and others participated. The ritual procedure was as follows: first, sacred ropes were stretched around the four directions of the newly built Shii Hall, then purification sand was placed in the courtyard, with offering tube stands placed in the center and sacred offerings erected. Next, eight high tables were positioned (four on the left, four on the right), with offerings placed on each (specifically, for one table: two sacred offerings, five grains wrapped in miscanthus grass, sacred sake served three times in earthenware cups, washed rice, one small sea bream, each placed in earthenware vessels used three times, and one sacred tree branch, etc. The remaining seven tables were arranged similarly). Next, two tables were set up in front center of the high tables (the left table held one small hemp offering, one Amatsu Oharae purification text, one prayer text, and one bundle of sacred tree leaves; the right table held one small hemp offering, one Kunitsu Oharae purification text, one Aōmi Oharae purification text wrapped in sacred tree leaves).

Next, two platform stands were placed in front (each with cross-shaped legs), with round cushions placed on top. After completion, white curtains were stretched from the pillars of the chief priest's corridor to the south end pillars of the connecting corridor, and also from the south pillars of the connecting corridor to the pillars of the temporary hall's worship area. After these preparations were completed, the purification ceremony took place. In this ceremony, first the vice-official proceeded to the main platform of the temporary hall, opened the sacred doors and withdrew. Then both the chief official and vice-official entered within the curtains and took their seats on the round cushions (removing shoes and bowing as usual, with the chief official on the left and vice-official on the right). Next, they bowed twice together, recited prayers, and clapped their hands (however, the vice-official did not recite prayers or clap).

Next, both officials took small hemp offerings and performed purification (at this time performing Amatsu Oharae, Kunitsu Oharae, and Aōmi Oharae purifications, though there was no formal opening of the three purification texts from beginning to end). Next, the chief official took the prayer text, removed the wrapping ceremonial paper, and read it. During this time, the vice-official took one bundle of sacred tree leaves and scattered them, then the chief official took one bundle of sacred tree leaves and scattered them, then the vice-official again took one bundle of sacred tree leaves and scattered them. After completion, both officials clapped twice, bowed twice, rose from their seats, and proceeded together to the temporary hall (crossing the center of the courtyard and ascending from the mounded area). They bowed once at the earthen platform (chief official toward the chief priest's side, vice-official toward the ritualist's side), ascended to the main platform, bowed once, and entered the inner sanctuary. The chief official circled from the chief priest's side to the ritualist's side, while the vice-official circled from the ritualist's side to the chief priest's side. After completing one circuit, they exited the inner sanctuary, then circled the main platform once (this procedure was the same as that of the inner sanctuary). After completion, they bowed once at the main platform earthen area and returned to their seats. Next, the vice-official rose, proceeded to the temporary hall, closed the sacred doors, and concluded. The sacred ropes of the hall, the central offerings, the sacred tree branches from the high tables, etc. were removed, and one or two strands of the sacred rope were taken.

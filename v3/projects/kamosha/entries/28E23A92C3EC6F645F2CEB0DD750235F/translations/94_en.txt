Concerning the construction of the temporary hall: April 11th is the day of the Misogi purification ceremony, and from the night of the 11th, both the middle gate and Chinese-style gate will have their doors closed and curtains lowered, and it is shrine law that no one passes through the shrine gates. Therefore, we would like to request suspension of construction within the shrine gates on the 12th and 13th. However, since this is urgent construction work, we cannot make this request. The 12th and 13th are governed by the ancient law as stated above, so we unavoidably make this request. We earnestly request your approval. The above.

1. For the reconstruction of the second torii gate, five rope-tying pots were attached to the lower crossbeam. Since the Construction Office had no objection to this, when the shrine community instructed the shrine attendants, regarding the matter of hanging the sacred ropes, they consulted with the helpers and day laborers, and hung them under the guidance of the shrine attendants. The pots were installed by local carpenters using scaffolding borrowed by the helpers. Although the sacred ropes should be hung by the shrine attendants, since the fresh paint might stick naturally, day laborers were asked to handle it before the inspection. However, regarding the regular rope ledger, the chief magistrates appeared and gave instructions.

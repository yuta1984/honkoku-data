Regarding whether it would be better to carefully finish the plain wood with raw silk, opinions were divided on this matter, but in any case, since this would differ from the specifications manual, it was decided that after consulting privately with the site officials to ensure no future complications with specifications, there should be further consultation.

One item: A speech was given from the same location stating that the pair of golden lanterns donated by the Imperial Court that stand before the main shrine were donated during the Kyōhō era, so during the Kanpō reconstruction they were left as they were. However, since repairs have now been ordered for the shrine's lantern stands as well, they would like to request that the Imperial Palace also provide repairs. After private consultation extending to Enpō era precedents and inquiring with Imperial Messenger Lord Kushinada, it was deemed appropriate to make this request to the Imperial Messenger this time. If so, repairs would continue to be ordered in the future as well. Therefore, a draft was read aloud, and it should be brought along at the next convenient opportunity.

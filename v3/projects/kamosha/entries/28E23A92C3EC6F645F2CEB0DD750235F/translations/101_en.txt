The head priest gave orders to the shrine servants, and the initial moving of the main hall began from the late hour of the Rat (around midnight) until approximately before the hour of the Tiger (around 4 AM), completing the attachment to the sacred ground. The garden torches were lit, the attendants advanced the sacred lamps, and the shrine servants and others rested briefly. Next, preparations were made to pull the foundation platform toward the worship hall, with the head carpenter having straw matting brought to the rear area. The garden torches were extinguished again and the foundation platform was pulled. This was indeed the pulling with straw matting prepared for the foundation platform. After completion, the garden torches were lit, the foundation platform was assembled under the main hall, and the binding of the sacred pillars was undone. Next, the head priest performed the offering ritual, the attendants served as intermediaries, and then the priest offered sacred sake as in the daily offerings. The sacred sake was received by the deputy head from the general magistrate, arranged on a sacred round tray and presented. Next, the evening offerings were presented like the morning offerings, and after completion, they withdrew.

1. Since the day laborers worked diligently, they were given three shō of sake. The valley shrine servants and others were given a five-shō barrel with woven goods.

1. At the retreat quarters, each person received the divine offerings and sacred sake.

Day 5

1. The area around the sacred ground and main hall, as well as around the worship hall, were cleaned by the valley shrine servants as instructed. The moving equipment belonging to the shrine association was collected and put away by the side-entering attendants as instructed.

1. Since the Kyoto carpenters were to assemble and construct the foundation platform for the new hall before the pillar-raising, there were instructions from the officials. Accordingly, Yasunao consulted with the magistrates about having the role carpenters install the floorboards inside the foundation platform, and thus the head carpenter and assistant head carpenter performed this duty. For other tasks such as transporting sacred pillars and temporary construction, the Kyoto carpenters and day laborers worked as they would on Kamo's temporary shrine.

1. For the daily offerings on pillar-raising day, the head priest, both officials, attendants and others proceeded to the subsidiary shrine and offered the single meal offering. The procedure was as yesterday, with each person having a communion meal at the shrine maiden's house, and one meal being a general market communion.

1. The morning offerings for the pillar-raising at the inner shrine were as yesterday.

1. Before the appointed time, the head priest and both officials (in court dress), attendants (in white robes and sashiguki), workshop official (in hunting dress), and the deputy head, administrator, and deputy administrator proceeded to the divine presence. A single tatami mat was placed in the center of the worship hall seating area, with the head priest to the west, the priest to the east, and the ritualist each facing north. On the west side, facing east in order of precedence from south, were the two attendants; on the east side, facing west in order of precedence from south, were the deputy head, administrator, and deputy administrator. On the garden above the foundation platforms of both halls, the workshop official sat on a round cushion in the southwest direction of the worship hall, and the role carpenters were arranged facing east in order of precedence from north, east of the rock boat. Under the western eaves of the worship hall were the plain-jacketed carriers handling the offering boxes and valley shrine servants (wearing upper and lower garments), with an additional five valley shrine servants in attendance wearing yellow robes.

1. From the construction team came Nakai Mizu-no-suke, Sakuma Jinpachi, Mano Hachirōbei (in noshime and hemp upper and lower garments), Kurahashi Sadanonjō, Murayama Tomiuemon, and master carpenter Kakui Saburōtarō (in hemp upper and lower garments). However, due to a mistake in Yasutsu's guidance, Yasunao went out to meet them near the retreat quarters and had them seated there. The master carpenter had formal matting laid out on the veranda as the place of honor, with the others seated behind.

Naturally, proper notification must be made to the meeting place at that time. Therefore, the regulations established by collective decision are as follows.
　　　　Tenna 3rd year, 5th month of the Year of the Boar
　　Such regulatory documents were handed over to the jitte (magistrate's assistants)

　　Since the descendants of Fujiki Gyōbu-no-taifu Sanao have died out, and there is a grandson of the 29-year-old heir, a report was made requesting to summon him to carry on the family succession.

The response to this was "Under these circumstances, it cannot be helped; I find this regrettable." 《Messenger: Uneme-no-suke》

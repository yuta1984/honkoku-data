These were Uji-yoshi, Ki-yō, and others.

On the 28th day of the 9th month of the same year, due to Uji-yoshi's death, he was relieved of sacred duties, and Sha-aki filled the vacancy. On the 1st day of the 12th month of the same year, due to the death of Kura-no-kami Toshi-aki, Kuni-aki, Sha-aki and others were relieved of sacred duties, and Yasu-kata, Sumi-aki and others filled those vacancies.
《Marginal note: However, this was during the period when Uji-yoshi's mourning period had not yet been completed》

- On the 3rd day of the 1st month of Kyōhō 3rd year, due to the deaths of Nara-uji Yoshi and Nagato-no-kami Kiyo-mitsu, I-aki was relieved of sacred duties. At that time, regarding those eligible for rotation duty, Kuni-aki was available for service due to his advanced age, and Uji-yoshi, though younger than Kuni-aki, was available for service having previously completed his term. With both already competing for the position, the council decided that Kuni-aki should fill the position based on the reasoning of his advanced age.

When the above-mentioned Kuni-aki and Uji-yoshi competed for the position, the relevant regulatory document had not yet been issued, so the council decided that Kuni-aki should fill the position based on seniority by age being appropriate. However, when the regulatory document was later reviewed, it was determined that henceforth the intent of the previous regulatory document should be strictly observed, and that rotation duty for any given year should follow the order of those who previously completed their terms. Therefore, this is added by council decision.

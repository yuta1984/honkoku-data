Regulations

1. Regarding the matter of the 120-day period before appointment to reciprocal fields: Until now, following the written instructions, ten people have been appointed annually. However, at present there are many people who have completed their required days of service. Therefore, the matter of establishing service days shall be temporarily postponed. Hereafter, when the 21st person in line for field appointment is reached, ten people starting from the first person onward shall be appointed.

However, even when reaching the first person, except for regular cases, it is not necessary to appoint from the halfway point.

1. Regarding service duties for the bi-seasonal purification ceremonies and cleaning: when all those who have completed their required days of service have finished their duties, service shall resume in order starting again from the duty head.

The above was unanimously decided through consultation among the three groups of elders, middle-aged, and young members.

8th day,己亥, intermittent rain. The ceremonial boar celebration was bestowed as in previous years.

9th day, 庚子, clear. From Shogo-in Palace's concurrent position at Shirakawa Village Shoko-in Palace, there was a formal visit to Omuro today. Tsunki was summoned as an attendant.

10th day, 辛丑, clear. Due to the shrine reconstruction, today after midday at the office building, everyone received individual grants of pure white vestments, hakama trousers, court caps, folding fans, etc. Advance arrangements had been made, and each person received them for tailoring and preparation. However, since I was on palace duty, I requested assistance from the head guardian. Also for this occasion, the shrine priests received full court dress sets, the clan people received pure vestments and below, the sword bearers and white shrine attendants received yellow robes, along with monks' vestment sets and other curtains, etc. The court outfitter Takada Benji, who serves our shrine, was commissioned by the shrine community, and he procured everything. In reality, Tsunsen had previously arranged through Tsuntsugu to have everything prepared. As a courtesy to me, one piece of gold was sent from Takada earlier. Furthermore, among the items distributed this time, the hakama trousers were to be made with especially good fabric, so during the warrior inspection, the monks' hakama were to be borrowed for inspection, then returned to the monks after examination, while Tsunsen's portion would be prepared later by Takada. Therefore, today I only received my portion of pure vestments, court cap, and folding fan.

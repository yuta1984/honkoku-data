This is what has been passed down from the beginning:
The chief supervisor continues in procession, and the officials sent by the Court of Justice
carry two arrows with eagle feathers,
while those of the Assistant Minister of Justice carry four with white feathers...
【Up to here is the continuation from the previous frame】
Others all carry two white feathers each,
placed there, appearing most solemn. The superintendent of the kebiishi (Imperial Police)
and the Assistant Minister of Justice and such distinguished persons have been
absent for a long time, so there are no ceremonies for the chief supervisor either.
This year there were many kebiishi of the sixth and fifth court ranks,
but I shall record the details.
The Assistant Ministers of Justice, palace kebiishi, and others
are said to have brought out their carriages and attended in the imperial procession.
In recent times, we no longer hear of such things.

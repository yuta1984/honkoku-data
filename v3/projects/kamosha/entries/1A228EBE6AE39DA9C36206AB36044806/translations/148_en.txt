Article 1: Among the internal wall notices, the three articles regarding fines for snow clogs, straw sandals, wooden clogs, etc., shall hereafter be removed from the front of the wall notices and placed within the annual events section.
I privately omit one article at this point.
Article 1: When tea masters and others are summoned by the annual event heads for irregular assemblies, it is unreasonable for the attending servants of the next-seated annual event officials to decline due to private matters.

【Red ink notation: Three Groups】Articles established by group consensus during the three-group assembly at the council hall on the last day of the 9th month of the same year
Article 1: While participants in the 10th and 11th day assemblies of the 2nd month are exceptional, for other occasions such as outer-group and west-central group assemblies and three-group meetings, since there are consistently no attendees and no one present, hereafter those who fail to attend three consecutive assemblies shall present one barrel and one dish per person to the assembly. This has been unanimously established by all three groups.
Article 1: Those taking leave for official shrine duties
Article 1: Those taking leave due to serious illness of themselves or, naturally, their relatives
Article 1: Those traveling to Kyoto or distant places
Article 1: Those facing obstacles or observing mourning periods or memorial services
For the above cases, their absence excuses shall be accepted. However, for those taking other types of leave who fail to attend despite assembly notifications, fail to attend subsequent assemblies, and fail to attend three assemblies, they shall present one barrel and one dish to the assembly at the fourth meeting.
For example, after a three-group assembly is held, if there is a west-central group assembly followed by another three-group assembly, the three-group and west-central group meetings are not counted separately, but as three-group assemblies

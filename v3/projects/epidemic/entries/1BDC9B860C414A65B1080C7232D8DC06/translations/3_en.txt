Heaven has unexpected storms and wind, and humans have unexpected illnesses.
If one does not treat according to the season, nothing can be done.
From late May of Bunkyū 2 (1862), measles spread generally throughout society,
and from mid-June it greatly proliferated throughout Edo. In any
household, four or five people or sometimes the entire family
would fall ill, and for several days many were unable to
conduct their family business, with not a single person
unafraid. Although this is an illness that has periodically
spread since ancient times, never has it been as severe as this time.
Therefore, to leave this as a tale for future generations,
I have decided to compile it into a small booklet.　　　　Written by Yōseitei Shigasai

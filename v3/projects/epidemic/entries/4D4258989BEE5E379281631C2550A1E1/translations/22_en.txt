Although the names of prescriptions for specific periods are recorded, since the quantities of medicinal ingredients are the domain of medical practitioners, laypeople knowing them would only lead to confusion. Therefore, I defer to the main text and omit these details, merely attempting to guide readers in understanding the principles of diagnosis and treatment, and to serve as a compass for ordinary people lacking proper knowledge, pointing out essential matters here and there. This is not intended for medical professionals to read, but merely presents the general principles.

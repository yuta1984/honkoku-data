Answering: The reason why using umbilical cord does not make the condition lighter is, as stated in the previous section, that when inherited toxins are deep, some may die and some may become severely ill. Rather than relying merely on the small use of umbilical cord, one should add medicinal treatments to provide rescue. After improving the manifestation of smallpox, evil heat may enter, or taking advantage when vital energy is exhausted by other diseases, some may die from the child's own inherent nervous disorders or parasitic accumulations.

In the "Gezhi Yulun" (Extra Treatises Based on Investigation of Things), there is an account where a Confucian scholar had five children who all died of smallpox, and when he reported this to Li Dongyuan, Dongyuan diagnosed that the man had red swelling and tumor toxins, and after treating this, he did not lose any more children to smallpox. This shows that one must examine the fundamental constitution inherited from the parents.

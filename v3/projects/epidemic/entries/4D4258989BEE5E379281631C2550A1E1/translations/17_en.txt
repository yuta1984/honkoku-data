○Also, making them eat akebi (chocolate vine) fruit is said to make it very mild.
　　A certain person's mother had mild smallpox at over seventy years of age. When she was young, she lived in a mountain home and often ate this fruit. Perhaps because of this effect over the years and months, she recovered mildly and lived to over ninety years of age. Hearing this story, I tried it on my child. Since it is difficult to obtain in the city, I searched for and procured just a little to use, and I heard that it was effective.

　　　Methods for Caring During Smallpox

○There is something called "smallpox contamination." Originally, epidemic qi has both visible and invisible spirits that touch and affect people, so if there are impure things, the pox color changes, becomes black and sunken, gets scratched and torn, and bleeds. For example, even if it is difficult to treat and one or two people die while one person has no problems, it cannot be trusted, but first, avoiding impurity should cause no harm. When young women are menstruating or when they have blackened their teeth with iron solution, they should not approach that place. Impure acts should not be performed. When contamination occurs, coriander wine should be sprayed on the four walls of the bedroom.

○For smallpox itching, frankincense should be burned under the bedding.

Answer: Living in harsh, mountainous terrain, there are places where epidemic pathogens do not invade. Areas around Yoshino in Yamato Province, Totsukawa, Kumano in Kii Province, Ryūjin, and in Kyushu places like Gotō, Hirado, Amakusa, etc., are said to largely avoid it. If food, drink, and clothing suit the person, fetal toxins are also reduced...

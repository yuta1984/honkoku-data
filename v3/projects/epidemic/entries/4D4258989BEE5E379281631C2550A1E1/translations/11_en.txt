It is good when it swells and fills. At this time, if the color is whitish and lacks firmness, it is because it has become cold or there has been diarrhea, preventing the "mountain opening." If you add cloves, milk, and glutinous rice to Naitaku-san, perforation of pus will occur. Chills and teeth grinding at this time indicate severe deficiency syndrome. Bushi-richu-to should be used. If the whole body becomes abraded, apply powdered new roof tiles by kneading. For dry retching, use Iko-san. In any case, provide nursing care without negligence.

However, use one large bowl to remove heat and dry it up. If used excessively, it will call forth kai-worms (intestinal parasites). Vomiting many roundworms is problematic. At this time, if stagnant blood accumulates in the abdomen causing abdominal pain, use Shunen-san. The common restorative medicines are Hogen-to and Hochu-

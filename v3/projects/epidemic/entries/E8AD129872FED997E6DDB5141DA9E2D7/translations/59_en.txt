Sake (rice wine) and bamboo grass (sasa) have examples of usage where the Japanese reading applies, and this should be broadly considered.

1. Barley does not stick when grasped in the palm, hence the meaning may be that smallpox scars will not remain.

1. Red beans (azuki) resemble sparse pox, as if azuki beans were split in two and applied, hence this may be favored.

1. Mouse droppings do not normally stick to the buttocks, hence this also means that smallpox scars will not remain.

1. The head of an old nail - just as a nail is quickly driven through, this may celebrate the hardening of the pustule heads.

1. Black beans neutralize all toxins, hence the meaning is to quickly resolve residual toxins.

1. There is the practice of adding soil from dog footprints. Even though this also leaves traces, the intention is for them to quickly disappear. Another theory states that since soil does not penetrate and stick to the soles of dogs' feet, this is used in sake decoction.

1. Bamboo grass (sasa) means "sake" (to avoid/leave). This represents the intention to purify the defilement of smallpox. It should be understood that post-smallpox prayers have no particular special significance and are simply post-smallpox charms.

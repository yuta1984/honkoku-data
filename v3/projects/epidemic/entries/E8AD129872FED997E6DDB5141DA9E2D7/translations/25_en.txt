《Note: Also called Kinnou Goougan (Golden Sac Bezoar Pills)》Generally, smallpox is a condition characterized by blood excess and qi deficiency, so the qi power to control toxic qi is weak. Therefore, when toxic qi becomes increasingly vigorous, it sinks into the spleen and stomach, causing toxins to stagnate between the muscles and flesh, making eruptions difficult to emerge. This causes stagnation both internally and externally, inevitably leading to adverse outcomes. When smallpox epidemics spread, using these Tenpu Pills resolves internal and external stagnation, preventing the suffering of toxic qi coagulation. However, this medicine does not reduce smallpox or resolve toxins per se - there is naturally a proper way to use it.

　　On Smallpox in Adults
Generally, smallpox in adults is more severe than in children because children embrace unity and have not yet separated from it, remaining as they were born without damaging their qi elsewhere. Adults have thick skin, exhaust their heart qi, indulge freely in alcohol and meat, and moreover become immersed in sexual activities, causing heart and kidney deficiency and depletion.

When such people contract smallpox, toxins stagnate in the surface skin making eruptions difficult to emerge, and because there is spiritual deficiency and depletion in what protects internally, pustules have difficulty erupting and suppurating. When toxins do not leak out, the abdomen and lower back ache, bowel movements do not pass, urine becomes oil-like, or bloody diarrhea occurs - all because toxins are vigorous while the interior is deficient. Medicine should also be given in large doses. One should keep women at a distance and deeply abstain from sexual desire.

　　On Smallpox in Women
Generally, after women begin menstruation, there are differences from men. When menstrual flow occurs during smallpox, it is good if it stops quickly. When it does not stop, adverse symptoms arise. If menstruation occurs during the eruption phase, the smallpox will not properly erupt and suppurate, becoming pale in color. Also, when menstruation occurs during smallpox, there may be day and night restlessness like madness with delirious speech - this requires prompt treatment.

The pain and itching were unbearable. Based on this, rice washing water has a cold nature, while sake has great heat. Therefore, when cold and warm harmonize together, they arouse yin and circulate yang, having the power to nourish and supplement qi and blood. One day, using this method and steaming with it, the pain and itching subsided by half, improved greatly after the second application, and after the third time all the sores were completely healed. It is recorded in the Honchō Ichiran that sake decoction began from this incident.

Then sake decoction should be performed. It must not be limited to the twelfth day. The method of sake decoction: first, have the smallpox patient eat comfortably, then put about one shō and five gō of hot water in a cedar tub, add about one gō of good sake into it, soak a red-dyed hand towel in the hot water, wring it well so there is no excess water, and for the first bath, steam the entire area from forehead to eyelids, both cheeks, and both jaws with the vapor.

However, the first bath should stop after one application. Immediately put the patient to bed with the wet nurse, cover the head and face with clothing, let them sleep well for about one toki (approximately two hours), and it is good to induce a slight sweat. This has the effect of neutralizing residual toxins. Furthermore, exposure to wind and cold after sake decoction should be prohibited. After performing the first bath, a god-sending ceremony should be conducted. It must not be limited to the twelfth day. Even though the god-sending ceremony is performed, one should be cautious about taboos as during the smallpox period and put effort into morning and evening care. There must be no negligence. The second bath should be spaced one day apart from this day.

There are also cases where the eruptions appear very densely, and recovery is achieved only after exhausting all treatments. There was also one case of severe adverse reaction leading to death on the sixth day, after which I prohibited the use of variolation methods. According to Li Renshan's theory, when variolation is performed on selected days, eight or nine out of ten cases proceed smoothly. However, even among those who contract smallpox naturally without variolation, eight or nine out of ten will recover completely if the treatment matches the disease. Therefore, deliberately inducing the disease through variolation may not necessarily be beneficial. Moreover, whether smallpox follows a favorable or adverse course, and whether eruptions are sparse or dense, is not determined solely by fetal toxins but varies according to seasonal conditions. Since diseases do develop naturally, if variolation results in dense eruptions and adverse symptoms, it would be harmful. One should refrain from such practices.

　　On Preventing Smallpox in Advance

[Left page]
There are many prescriptions from ancient physicians for preventing smallpox in advance: Xuantu Pills, Prophylactic Pills, Guben Pills, Xidou Baoying Pills, Xiaodu Xidou Pills, Xiaodu Baoying Pills, Longfeng Pills, Rabbit Blood Pills, Tuhong Pills, Erxue Pills, and various others that are too numerous to enumerate. However, when I tested and tried them, they showed no efficacy. The "Huoyou Xinfa" (Essential Methods for Protecting Children) also states that wealthy families, in their love for their children, summon physicians during smallpox epidemics to administer detoxifying and dispersing medicines. The physicians, not understanding that there is no reason to make the eruptions lighter, recklessly use medicines that damage the spleen and stomach, injure qi and blood, break down vital energy, and corrupt the flesh. Later, when the child contracts smallpox, the residual toxicity from the medicines used in anticipation creates adverse conditions, ultimately leading to incurable situations - truly pitiable.
I have already described in detail earlier that medicines should not be used recklessly before smallpox onset. However, there is a prescription called Niuhuang Tianfu Pills in the secret formulas of an ancient physician named Fengshishan.

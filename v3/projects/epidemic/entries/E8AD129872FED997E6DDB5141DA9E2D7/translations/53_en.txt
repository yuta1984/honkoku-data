may also depart together with the smallpox toxin. If one violates the taboos and neglects nursing care, harm will remain and become a lifelong affliction. One must be cautious. However, even though taboos should be the priority, it is only for about a hundred days after smallpox, so it is just a temporary matter. Nevertheless, it should not be taken lightly.

　　On the Theory of Sake Bath (Ritual Bathing)
1. The timing for the sake bath (also called sasa bath) for smallpox is around the fourteenth or fifteenth day from the initial outbreak. Depending on the density and severity, it is considered good to perform the sake bath on the tenth, twelfth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-first, or twenty-fifth day. Among common people, some believe it should be limited to the twelfth day, but this is a great error. If the smallpox symptoms become somewhat irregular, around the eleventh or twelfth day is just when suppuration is at its

peak, and it is still difficult to determine whether the outcome will be good or bad. Even if the medicine is appropriate and life is sustained, if it is this type of symptom, one should wait until around the seventeenth or eighteenth day to perform the sake bath. Also, there is a condition called "blood scab pox" where the sores are few and symptoms are light - in this case, the pus color becomes full on the fifth or sixth day, and on the eighth or ninth day, blood scabs form like split adzuki beans attached to the skin. For this symptom, the sake bath should be performed on the tenth day. Conversely, due to common people's sentiment, before the sake bath, they believe the smallpox patient is entrusted to the smallpox deity, and since the deity dislikes impurity, they diligently maintain cleanliness day and night and put care into all matters, which naturally benefits the smallpox patient. However, once they perform the sake bath and think they have sent the deity away, the household first feels relieved and naturally develops a neglectful attitude, not putting as much care into taboos and nursing as before, and the handling of all matters gradually becomes careless.

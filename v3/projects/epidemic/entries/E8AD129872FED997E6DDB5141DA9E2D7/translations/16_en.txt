Sardines cause qi and blood to stagnate, incense sticks and powdered incense diminish people's vital energy, and cycad and holly are adopted from the practice of using them during Setsubun based on the principle that they ward off evil spirits.

Also, rubbing and breaking the erupted sores on hands and feet causes them to become purulent.

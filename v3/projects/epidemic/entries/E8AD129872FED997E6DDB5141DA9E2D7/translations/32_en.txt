　　On the Theory of Worshipping the Smallpox Deity
The practice of worshipping the smallpox deity appears to exist in China as well, as recorded in books such as the "Hōei-roku" (Record of Protecting Infants) and "Ryūsei-shū" (Collection of Flowing Blue).
In Japan too, since ancient times, smallpox has been called a disease of demons and spirits, and worshipping the smallpox deity has been the primary practice. However, to blindly worship only the deity while neglecting medical treatment, thereby falling into superstition, is truly the height of unfilial conduct and lack of compassion.

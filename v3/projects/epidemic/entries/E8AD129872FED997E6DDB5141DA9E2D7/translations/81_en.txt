　　　　　When smallpox first appears and is red in color, it necessarily
　　　　　resembles blood heat. During the first four to five days of initial outbreak, it may be used little by little without problem. It should be well
　　　　　boiled, rinsed in water, and mixed with salted miso before giving.
　　　　　It should not be used carelessly during smallpox.
- Matsutake mushroom　　There is a theory that dried matsutake mushrooms decocted in water
　　　　　are effective for those whose smallpox does not appear initially, but this has not yet been tested. All
　　　　　mushroom varieties are spontaneously generated, so they should not be carelessly
　　　　　given to patients and children. However, the four varieties of stone mushroom, shimeji, namesusuki, and
　　　　　hatsutake are said to be harmless when given to patients and children, but
　　　　　it is also good to prohibit their use during and after smallpox.

- Kelp　　Non-toxic. It promotes urination and disperses nodular swelling. It should not be given
　　　　　raw. It should not be used from the fifth to the twelfth day during smallpox. It should be well washed
　　　　　and thoroughly cooked in soy sauce before giving. Both children and wet nurses may
　　　　　use it without problem.
- Shepherd's purse (nazuna)　　Non-toxic. It harmonizes the interior and moves down the qi of the five organs. It should be prohibited
　　　　　during smallpox. Those with eye diseases after smallpox benefit from its use. It should be well
　　　　　boiled and mixed with salted miso before giving.
- Chickweed (hakobe)　　Non-toxic. It is said to have the effect of treating malignant sores, but it also has the
　　　　　ability to break up blood. It should not be used during smallpox. After twelve days following smallpox,
　　　　　it may be given without problem.

1. Wild Boar (Inoshishi)　　　　Non-toxic. It supplements and moisturizes the skin and benefits the essence of the five organs. Generally,
　　　　　it is beneficial when used during the cold period after October, but it should not
　　　　　be given carelessly. Most particularly, people of Tosa in Shikoku always seek boar meat
　　　　　when there is smallpox, cooking it thoroughly in thin miso soup with a little added sake to give
　　　　　to the smallpox patient. If fresh meat is unavailable, salt-preserved
　　　　　meat may be well-cooked and given. If the child cannot yet eat solid food,
　　　　　the broth should be given. This is said to be good for recovery
　　　　　from smallpox. When I consider this,
　　　　　there is a theory in Hu's Eighty-One Essays about using pig tail blood. This refers to domestic pig
　　　　　blood, but since they are quite similar, perhaps this is why it is used.

　　　　　However, pig tail blood must not be used carelessly. If mistakenly given to patients with
　　　　　qi deficiency or weakness-type smallpox, it will necessarily lead to serious
　　　　　consequences, as should be known.

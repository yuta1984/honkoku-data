Along the Tōkaidō to the Hara-Yoshiwara area, the entire region suffered deaths. According to reports, there were extremely many deaths around Java (Kōba). British and Russian people came to Nagasaki to avoid the disease, but 20-30 people on their ship contracted this illness and landed in Nagasaki. It is said that the contagion spread from there. In my opinion, this was a type of ancient shichū (corpse toxin), similar to hishi tonshi (flying corpse, fleeing corpse). What is called chūaku kikeki (evil spirit attack) is also a symptom of this type. The conventional medical treatments are circuitous and slow. I have different ideas about this. The cholera of this year was most severe in Edo, with deaths totaling—combining men and women—25,554 from samurai families and 18,680 from merchant households. Truly, coffins could not be supplied in time, and with no space even in teahouses, empty sake barrels were piled up like at liquor stores. Some people are said to have revived after several days. This should be called the great epidemic since the Kyōhō era. The following year, Kimihibitsuji, it epidemic again, and subsequently ran concurrently with measles most severely. Continuing from this, it never ceased year after year, and in recent years

it has become severe from time to time, harming people in numbers beyond counting. Those who are doctors should especially devote their hearts to careful examination, investigate the fundamentals and seek the source, and must strive to save lives. However, regarding the symptoms of the Kyōhō era, no medical texts have yet been seen that discuss and record them. Concerning the Bunsei illness, only Nishida Shōkō (Kōetsu) of Osaka wrote a book called "Zakki-byō An" (Treatise on Miscellaneous Qi Diseases) and discussed it in detail. Also, Mr. Udagawa of Tsuyama translated Western theories and described the use of calomel. During the Ansei period, Western writings appeared one after another in the world. However, there was no settled theory regarding disease origin and treatment, and as for Chinese medicine, there were only one or two small works. When I investigate this in Chinese books, Wu Zhenfang's "Tan Wang" states what is called "with coffins and without coffins, the count at the nine gates already exceeded 200,000," and in the preface to Wang Ting's "Shazhang Yuheng," what is called "I was in the capital Yan, when epidemic disease greatly arose, patients' chests and abdomens became somewhat full,

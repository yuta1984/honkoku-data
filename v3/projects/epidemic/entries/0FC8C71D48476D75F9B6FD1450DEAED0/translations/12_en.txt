it becomes disease, quite severe, and is also named 'pestilent qi.' Though there are many varieties that differ from one another, there is no year without occurrence. As for gourd-flesh epidemic and pox-warm diseases, even the mild cases progress from morning onset to evening death, while the acute cases kill within moments. These are the most severe among all epidemics, symptoms rarely seen in nearly a hundred years. Therefore it is difficult to discuss them alongside ordinary epidemics" - this should be considered a sound argument.

In the autumn of Wuwu year, from the 29th day of the 7th month to the 10th day of the 9th month, I treated this disease in approximately 800-plus people, to the extent of forgetting sleep and meals day and night. In subsequent years, through accumulated experience I gained considerable insights, and therefore recorded these treatment experiences and authored works such as "Treatise on Epidemic Treatment" and "Essential Knowledge of Violent Diarrhea." Hence I will not elaborate on those treatment methods here as it would be redundant.

Originally this disease began in Europe and in recent times spread to our imperial nation. Many folk doctors in both Japanese and Chinese traditions consider it an unprecedented disease, merely imitating Western treatment methods while few know of the discoveries made by ancient sages. Therefore I present the historical records of Japanese and Chinese medicine to clarify matters for those who are confused.

　　　Appendix: Methods for Avoiding Epidemics

In the Analects it states "village exorcism," with Kong Anguo's annotation "to drive out epidemic demons." In "Suburban Special Sacrifice" it states "village purification," with Zheng Xuan's annotation "to expel strong demons, meaning to conduct exorcism, search rooms, drive out epidemics and chase away strong demons." If this is so, then already in the Zhou period there were rituals to drive out epidemics. Tusu wine and spiced plates were also the origins of epidemic avoidance, and since ancient times those who recorded such methods have been numerous.

Zhang Hua's "Records of Diverse Matters" states: "During Emperor Wu of Han's time, there was a great epidemic in Chang'an, and everyone in the palace fell ill with epidemic disease. The emperor did not hold entertainments, but ordered Qijian to request burning one piece of tribute incense to avoid the epidemic qi. The emperor had no choice but to consent, whereupon all the sick in the palace recovered that very day."

The "Compendium of Materia Medica" states: "Jiangzhen incense, also called purple perilla incense - burning it avoids seasonal epidemics and household anomalies. Once there was a person struck by lightning who fortunately did not die, but half his body turned black and would not heal for a long time. All physicians could not cure it, but a strange person taught him to burn jiangzhen incense and fumigate with it, whereupon the black color immediately changed and returned to normal. A miraculous prescription."

210　　　　　　Oral Immunization Against Dysentery, Typhus, and Cholera
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
These cells existing within organs participate in infection at almost their full expense; these cells likewise participate in defensive action to the same degree as mobile phagocytes. These entities that only superficially oppose all viruses and all foreign substances, namely the susceptible cells—fixed phagocytes—act only in the presence of bacteria that show specific selective affinity.
　Simply put, susceptible cells that share responsibility with the organism as a whole react with their own particular attitude, and also in cases of infection and immunity; this reaction becomes increasingly evident as the organs to which they belong differ. This autonomous system can be stated somewhat schematically and uniformly with little objection: each virus has its own cells, and each cell has its own immunity.

　　　　　Role of Mordants in Infection and Immunity
　Role des Mordants Dans l'Infection et l'Immunité(1)

　As soon as they are born, humans and animals are invaded by bacteria like swarms of clouds that strive to cover natural cavities, epidermis, and mucous membranes. Even though physiological functions continue to be accomplished without showing any recognizable difficulties, a tolerable state is established between these bacteria and the cells of the organism.
　The natural immunity possessed by skin and mucous membranes is, under normal living conditions, sufficient even against the most dangerous bacteria. In humans, apart from pathological states, it is well known how frequently one encounters dysentery bacilli, typhus bacilli, and cholera bacilli, not to mention all types of staphylococci and streptococci. In laboratory animals, it is known that these viruses can be applied to the epidermis or introduced into the digestive tract without showing any hindrance. Highly virulent anthrax bacilli can be instilled into the conjunctival sac without causing the slightest infection.
　As long as skin and mucous membranes are maintained anatomically intact, their immunity is not violated. However, when the equilibrium between cells and viruses is disrupted, it is sufficient to evoke latent infection: bacteria that had been living symbiotically with cells until that time suddenly acquire and manifest virulence, which one can hardly doubt.

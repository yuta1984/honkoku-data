To my dear colleague and friend,

I am delighted to learn that you have completed the Japanese translation of my work "Studies on Immunity in Infectious Diseases." I am well aware of how diligently you are working to promote the field of local immunology in Japan.

Therefore, it is quite natural that you should freely proceed with the publication of the Japanese translation.

I always cherish the fond memories of various experiences during your stay here.

We are fortunate to have been able to participate in the research you once conducted at the Pasteur Institute.

is a new and effective method for preventing one of the most severe diseases in children.'
　However, until today we are not permitted to agree with the author's optimism regarding the effectiveness of this vaccine.
　Even if it has been proven that heated streptococci can prevent strangles, it cannot be said that the same method would be applicable to scarlet fever, which has only rather distant similarities to strangles.
　If Gabritchewsky's vaccine protects against scarlet fever, above all, streptococci must be an important element in that disease. Even if we acknowledge that streptococci are the true pathogen of scarlet fever, there is no proof whatsoever of success in vaccinating against this disease with heated cultures. Whether it can be said with certainty that streptococcal infections, unlike most bacterial infections, cannot be prevented in animals by methods using dead bacteria.
　For all these reasons, we can hardly avoid reserving judgment about the effectiveness of scarlet fever preventive vaccines.
　However, recent studies conducted on monkeys by Cantacuzène, Bernhardt, and then Landsteiner, Levaditi & Pracek appear to have substantiated these reservations.
　Cantacuzène's experiments involved injecting lower monkeys (Cercopithecus cephus, Macaca rhesus, M. sinicus, Cercopithecus griseo-viridis) with blood, pericardial fluid, or tracheal-tracheobronchial lymph glands from scarlet fever patients. After an incubation period of 5 to 37 days, these monkeys exhibited the following symptoms: fever fluctuating between 40° and 41° for three days, adenopathy, and reddish-purple rash appearing on the trunk, face, and even forearms, lasting about 36 hours. This rash peeled off in large scales on the face and small scales on the back, and disappeared in the limbs within five days. One monkey also showed marked edema at the base of the tail, buttocks, and thighs.
　Soon after, Bernhardt published research on experimental scarlet fever; he particularly emphasized that the scarlet fever pathogen is never found together with streptococci, and that an invisible virus that passes through filters is involved. Using virus that passed through a Berkefeld filter, Bernhardt succeeded in causing disease in two out of four monkeys.
　At approximately the same time, Landsteiner, Levaditi & Pracek succeeded in applying tonsillar deposits taken from scarlet fever patients to monkey throats, causing temperature elevation, redness and swelling of the tonsils, followed by generalized rash in these animals.

　All these experiments, though not conclusive, now show that streptococci cannot be considered the true pathogen of scarlet fever, and therefore vaccines made with heated cultures of streptococci show no preventive action.

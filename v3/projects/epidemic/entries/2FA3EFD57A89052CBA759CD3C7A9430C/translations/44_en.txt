after contact, the plague bacteria that initially killed mice at a dose of 0.0005g became almost non-toxic, and mice showed no harm at 0.01g, which is more than 20 times the original amount.

Incidentally, bacteria rendered non-toxic become excellent vaccines, as seen in our experiments with typhus and plague bacteria as well.

When applying the grinding-based extraction method described earlier for typhus bacterial endotoxin to plague bacteria, we obtain a liquid showing slight opalescence. This liquid soon becomes clear, leaving a precipitate of intracellular bacterial debris at the bottom of the container.

In sealed test tubes, plague bacterial endotoxin could be preserved in the refrigerator for several months.

In contrast, the influence of high temperatures changed its appearance and simultaneously significantly reduced its toxicity.

Thus, when kept at 100° for 30 minutes, plague bacterial endotoxin extracted by the grinding method produces a considerable amount of white, coarse floating matter resembling boiled egg white. At 80°, coagulation is already nearly complete; however, at 100°, the volume actually decreases. At 70° (1 hour), the bacterial endotoxin takes on an opalescent liquid appearance; at 65° (1 hour), it begins to become turbid. The toxicity begins to decrease markedly as soon as the first signs of coagulation (65°) appear, and completely disappears when temperatures of 80°-100° are reached.

When 0.40g of dried plague bacteria, 0.15g NaCl, and 20cc H₂O are dispensed, we obtained bacterial endotoxin that could kill 15g mice within 24 hours at doses of 1/50-1/80cc by subcutaneous injection. With larger amounts (1/20-1/10cc), it killed them in 4-5 hours.

Intraperitoneal injection is even more toxic: the reliable lethal dose for 17-18g mice was 1/160cc in 10-12 hours.

White rats (50g) die with 1/8cc injected subcutaneously or 1/25cc injected intraperitoneally.

This plague bacterial endotoxin, so toxic to mice, as we said earlier,

no longer kills mice as soon as the toxin begins to coagulate. At 100°, it completely loses its toxicity. Already at 70° (1 hour), the toxicity changes markedly, and injecting 1cc (50-80 times the lethal dose) subcutaneously into mice is harmless, and the mice do not develop disease.

The weakening of bacterial endotoxin begins at 65°.

How does heated bacterial endotoxin become non-toxic? Everything suggests that the toxin is destroyed, because mice injected with coagulated bacterial endotoxin gain no immunity whatsoever.

With unheated plague bacterial endotoxin, exactly like bacterial bodies, it provides immunity against living virus but does not provide immunity against the toxin itself.

Thus, in our experiments, mice that first received subcutaneously a sub-lethal amount of bacterial endotoxin died exactly like controls when they received the minimum lethal dose of bacterial endotoxin 8 days later.

Therefore, at least in mice, active immunity against bacterial endotoxin does not appear to develop.

Plague bacterial endotoxin is very easily neutralized by anti-plague bacterial endotoxin serum: mice that received a mixture of 0.25cc of this serum with 50 times the lethal dose of bacterial endotoxin were certain to survive.

Having failed to obtain pertussis bacterial toxin by commonly used techniques, Bordet and Gengou resorted to the grinding method we recommended for bacteria such as typhus, plague, and dysentery to extract pertussis bacterial endotoxin.

These researchers chose 3-day cultures. Thick bacterial debris collected from 15 test tubes was suspended in 20cc of physiological saline, then vacuum-dried at 37° in the presence of caustic soda. The residue was mixed with 0.33g of dried salt and ground to make it as fine as possible.

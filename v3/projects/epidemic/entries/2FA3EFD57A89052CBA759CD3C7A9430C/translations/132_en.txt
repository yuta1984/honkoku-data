What direct experimentation has immediately proven is that in guinea pigs with cutaneous immunity, solid anti-anthrax immunity exists, but no trace of antibodies exists in the blood.

Although no one any longer disputes the favorable results of cutaneous inoculation, whose trials have already been put into practice today, its mechanism is still a matter of debate. According to Bordet, "cutaneous inoculation represents an extremely effective means of preventive vaccination" because he says "anthrax bacilli proliferate better intracutaneously than intraperitoneally. Furthermore, he adds, the skin does not admit to acquiring immunity without treating it the same as others."

Our esteemed friend's authority in immune substances has created an obligation to resolve the misunderstanding that this opinion has generated.

If we sufficiently understand Bordet's thinking, the immunity of guinea pigs given cutaneous immunity is not local but systemic, because not only the skin but all organs acquire immunity simultaneously. What we are reminded of is that organ immunity, as Bordet suggests, is not acquired immunity but natural immunity, and this immunity does not follow cutaneous inoculation; it exists beforehand and forms an inviolable zone in all normal guinea pigs.

The second opinion appears quite reasonable at first glance. "When attenuated anthrax bacilli are injected in small amounts into the peritoneal cavity of guinea pigs, they do not develop there; this succeeds better in the skin or intracutaneously." This is, according to Bordet, the reason why transcutaneous preventive vaccination gives better success than any other route.

If this were the true reason for the success of cutaneous inoculation, it should succeed only with living bacteria. However, experimental findings show that similar results can be obtained with sterile edema fluid. This fluid—a true anthrax bacillus antivirus—when inoculated intracutaneously, confers more solid and more lasting immunity than when injected subcutaneously.

Furthermore, this is exactly the same as in the case of cutaneous preventive vaccination against staphylococci or streptococci: that is, the relevant antivirus confers immunity without causing the development and proliferation of cocci intracutaneally, as will be described later.

In concluding the problem concerning anthrax, a few words remain to be said about the problem of passive immunity. Among known antibacterial sera, anti-anthrax serum is the one that most frequently gives satisfaction in practical use. Is this due to antibody content? This is probably not the case, and here is the reason.

Let us recall Ascoli's experiment, in which he brought anti-anthrax serum into contact with anthrax bacilli, and after thus depriving the serum of antibodies, he confirmed that this serum remained equally active after the procedure as before.

Therefore, it is not antibodies that give anti-anthrax serum its specific ability, nor is it antibodies that govern the generation of its active immunity.

Staphylococci and streptococci are characterized by their affinity for the skin involved in anthrax bacillus infection.

Staphylococci and streptococci can serve sufficiently as ordinary antigens, and this way of thinking is widely accepted.

Anti-staphylococcal serum hardly qualifies to occupy a position among the weapons of serum therapy. However, no one has been ignorant since Wright's work that vaccine therapy does not achieve much success in humans: anti-staphylococcal immunity should therefore not be denied, yet we never see so-called guarantee substances, namely antibodies, in the serum that confers this immunity.

In laboratory animals, exactly as in humans, anti-staphylococcal or anti-streptococcal immunity can be created. However, the main thing is that for this purpose, the usual methods aimed at antibody production must be abandoned. While preventive vaccination of guinea pigs by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal routes gives unfavorable or completely zero results, intradermal vaccine inoculation, where antibody formation is minimized, actually confers solid immunity. A more interesting fact is that vaccines applied to simply shaved or depilated

196　　　　　　Oral Immunization Against Dysentery, Typhus, and Cholera
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
The path we should take is fully described. Should we not undertake research to implement entero-vaccination?

This vaccination method has been proven by laboratory research, as we will describe later.

From the numerous experiments we conducted on rabbits or mice—experiments later confirmed by other researchers—it is clear that these animals can be prevented quite easily by oral administration. When we made them swallow killed dysentery bacteria, we confirmed that they acquired quite remarkable dysentery immunity already after a short period: these animals resist the certainly lethal dose of virus injected subcutaneously, intravenously, intraperitoneally, or administered orally. [(1) See previous page]

Very recently, Alivisatos and Iovanovic performed oral dysentery vaccination in rabbits using our experimental method. By varying the amount of vaccine, they found that when 70mg of vaccine was administered per os, the animals were reliably immunized against four times the lethal dose without causing any disturbance. Because immunity formation was rapid, they also observed that this method was superior to that observed in parenteral immunization methods. That is, they confirmed that immunity already occurred after 2 days, and by the 4th day this immunity became solid, with animals becoming resistant to four times the lethal dose of virus.

These authors further observed that immunity achieved orally was strictly specific. That is, when experimenting with various types of dysentery bacteria, they found no cross-immunity: protection against the bacteria occurred only when vaccine prepared with Shiga bacilli was administered orally; if the vaccine was prepared with bacteria such as Strong, Flexner, or Y, it provided no protection.

What is the nature of this immunity?

The rapidity of immunity establishment does not favor general immunity as commonly believed today. Indeed, according to the results of our experiments, following oral vaccination, immunity can be established in animals on the 2nd to 3rd day, which is considered an insufficient period for antibody production. Moreover, when examining the blood of animals immunized per os, it does not provide favorable evidence for antibody participation.

However, when blood is examined some time after a single administration of dysentery vaccine, agglutinins are discovered quite frequently. But do agglutinins control the development of immunity? This seems unlikely, and let me explain why.

If these antibodies were related to immunity, the more solid the immunity becomes, the more antibodies there should be. In other words, the agglutinin content of serum should increase with each new swallowing of vaccine. However, what we observe is the opposite: serum that agglutinates dysentery bacteria after the first swallowing of vaccine has far fewer agglutinins after the second swallowing, and more frequently, after the third swallowing of vaccine, it no longer agglutinates at all.

What is the reason for this? Here I will present the explanation that seems most reasonable to us. Following the first absorption of vaccine, the bacterial endotoxins contained in the vaccine cause ulceration in the intestinal wall; this can actually be demonstrated by macroscopic examination when animals are sacrificed shortly after inoculation; these ulcers form a kind of mild dysentery. The vaccine in the intestines passes through these lesions in the intestinal mucosa, enters the general circulation, and there forms antibodies, particularly agglutinins.

After a certain period, albeit short, these ulcers heal with scarring. After this time, the intestinal wall becomes specifically impermeable to dysentery bacteria. It is useless for animals to swallow new amounts of these bacteria, as the intestines resist like an impassable barrier against the bacteria, so the bacteria can no longer enter the living body. Antibodies are also no longer formed. Since this occurs when immunity becomes most solid, only few or almost no antibodies are seen in the blood.

Therefore, we can establish that the immunity of animals immunized orally against dysentery bacteria is not related to the presence of antibodies, but is particularly local and cellular in the intestines. We can further add that this intestinal immunity is quite important, because intestinal immunity is sufficient to make the entire animal immune to dysentery bacteria.

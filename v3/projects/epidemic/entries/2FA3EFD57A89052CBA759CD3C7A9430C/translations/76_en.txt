128　　　　　　　　　　　Cholera Vaccination
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
One will recall the research conducted on sensitized vaccines that formed the initial problem of this explanation. In animals inoculated with the relevant vaccine, local and systemic symptoms were reduced to extremely mild levels, and in the case of patients, symptoms were absent. Furthermore, in animals injected with sensitized cholera bacteria, immunity appears with a rapidity not seen in cases of ordinary vaccines. Would this not be the same in humans?

The Tokyo epidemic is particularly instructive from this perspective.
This epidemic occurred in 1916 in Japan's capital and its suburbs. This was at the same time as the great Romanian experiment in the Balkans mentioned earlier. That is, in the Balkans heated bacteria were used, while in Tokyo sensitized vaccine was used. It should be added that this epidemic was the first major epidemic during which vaccine was widely used.

The details of this epidemic were recorded in detail in an even more instructive study written by Yabe and published in 1920.

Before deciding to administer the vaccine to the public, it was determined that preliminary experiments were necessary: 15 people belonging to the Kitasato Institute received sensitized bacteria subcutaneously.

The side effects from the vaccine were not remarkable; those who were vaccinated showed large amounts of bacteriolysins in their serum: namely, under the conditions, it appeared justified in the eyes of Japanese scholars to use the vaccine over a vast range.

Beginning during the height of the epidemic's fury, preventive injections were administered particularly to people considered to be exposed to infection (fishermen, restaurant employees, etc.).

To reach a conclusion, let me describe details that are extremely beneficial to epidemiologists.

　　　　　　　　┌Among 2,244,796 non-vaccinated persons, 382 cholera patients,

――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
Combining urban and rural areas, among the vaccinated, the morbidity rate was about 25 times lower than among the non-vaccinated.

The results in this cholera prevention area are actually more remarkable than those shown in the above statistical table. According to actual investigation, there were only three cholera patients seen among the vaccinated, but this occurred in those who received insufficient vaccine doses.

During the Tokyo epidemic, hundreds of victims among the non-vaccinated were recorded as valuable facts for laboratory experiments, just as in the Balkans. In one district of the city, one-third of the residents were given vaccine, but not one contracted cholera; among the remaining non-vaccinated in that district, there were 18 patients. Another district was completely spared from the epidemic, as all its residents were vaccinated at once.

In families consisting of many people, only the non-vaccinated fell ill; the others, namely the vaccinated, did not fall ill despite living under the same conditions.

Regarding reactions from vaccination, according to Japanese researchers, they were not remarkable or completely absent in the majority (80-95%).

Despite vaccination being performed in large epidemic areas, not a single case of exacerbation attributable to the negative phase was reported.

This Tokyo experiment, being the first large-scale use of sensitized cholera preventive vaccine, should not be overlooked as particularly remarkable.

　　　　　　　　　＊　　＊　　．
Based on the several epidemic reports we have summarized, it would be wrong to challenge the efficacy of cholera vaccination. However, such is not the impression that comes from the initial part of our explanation. Where does this discrepancy between reality and the laboratory come from?

Complex reasons are involved in this.
First, there are psychological reasons. The insufficiently supported resolution of the French committee in 1885, as well as Ferran's excessive modesty at the beginning, caused severe dissatisfaction with the method.

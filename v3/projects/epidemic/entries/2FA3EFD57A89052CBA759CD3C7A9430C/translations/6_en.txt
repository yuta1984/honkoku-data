Preface
　The fifteen chapters contained in this publication are dedicated primarily to problems that we have researched from an experimental perspective over the past thirty years at the Institut Pasteur. Among the notable problems, those that are actually the same issue but present different appearances are the problems of prophylactic and therapeutic inoculation methods. Due to adopting materials from other researchers, the initial framework concerning this problem could not avoid frequent and significant expansion, and it was also unavoidable to occasionally make appropriate references to establish definitive opinions. What is summarized in this booklet is a unification of previously published critiques.

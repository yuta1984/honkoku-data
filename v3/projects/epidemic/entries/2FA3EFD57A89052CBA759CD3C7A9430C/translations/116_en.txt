208　　　　　　Oral Immunization Against Dysentery, Typhus, and Cholera

immunity comparable in all respects must be demonstrated.
　For this final demonstration, in collaboration with Golovanoff, we directed our experiments.

　We previously saw, in the case of staphylococcus and streptococcus, that susceptible cells of the skin are easily vaccinated not only by the bacterial bodies themselves, but also by soluble substances extracted from these bacterial bodies. We particularly drew attention to the effective results of applying specific wet compresses to humans and animals. At that time, we naturally questioned whether similar substances could be obtained using viruses that have selective affinity for the intestines.
　Experiments conducted with cholera bacilli based on this principle clearly demonstrated the validity of our expectations. Starting from old broth cultures, we obtained a non-toxic liquid that resists 120°C. When injected subcutaneously, this substance has specific preventive capacity and confers immunity against cholera infection without producing antibodies after 24 hours.
　This represents properties not typically encountered with subcutaneous vaccination routes, but rather represents a comprehensive presence of properties observed in oral vaccination cases. How shall we conclude from this?
　The conclusion reached is that immunity in cholera—and this appears highly probable in dysentery, typhus diseases, and other diseases as well—is merely a uniform mechanism, identical whether the digestive route or parenteral route is employed. This immunity, in its rapid manifestation, clearly operates through something other than antibodies. This immunity is, in other words, tissular and established within susceptible cells.
　Antibodies accompanying subcutaneous vaccine injection are clearly not indispensable for the establishment of active immunity. In our opinion, they merely indicate the invasion of foreign proteins into the circulatory system by routes other than the natural pathways of skin or mucosal damage.

　Regarding the period of 5-6 days after which immunity is established when vaccines are used parenterally, we believe this is merely a coincidental timing: even if commonly used cholera preventive vaccines only immunize after 5-6 days, this is because animals require this period to digest cholera bacilli through their phagocytic cells and subsequently release the specific substances contained within these bacilli. As soon as this substance—antivirus—is released, it binds to susceptible cells, and immunity is immediately established thereafter.

　Combining these facts gives rise to the idea that we should not blindly listen to antibody formation in immunity. We do not wish to say that antibodies are always unnecessary. That is, in cholera, which is considered an intestinal infection, the organism can produce antibodies despite the infection being in the intestines; in this case, intestinal immunity is sufficient to ensure protection of the infected animal. In other cases, there may be massive infections where the intestines are overwhelmed and cholera bacilli invade the entire organism. In such events, the animal must use all defensive measures at its disposal, including antibodies.

　It was upon the study of cholera infection and cholera immunity that almost the entire humoral theory of immunity was built. One knows the responses made by supporters of the cellular theory to this. After the memorable studies of comparative pathology of inflammation, how should we think about the existence of different defensive mechanisms in higher vertebrates than in other representatives of the animal kingdom? Also, Metchnikoff's general theory gained almost unanimous approval. The phagocytic theory was entirely transposed to the realm of higher vertebrates.
　However, this theory originated mainly from studies of invertebrates. In these latter organisms, white blood cells play a major, though not absolute, role in infection and immunity.
　But in higher vertebrates, one may question whether special roles should not be assigned to fixed phagocytes. In the struggle between viruses and higher organisms, in our opinion, it is the susceptible cells that participate as first-order elements. The organs'

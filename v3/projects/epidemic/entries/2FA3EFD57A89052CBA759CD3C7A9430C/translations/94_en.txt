nearby areas, and several heat rashes on the upper chest.
　Examination of the pemphigus serous fluid showed staphylococci in pure form. Through the action of bandaging with staphylococcal vaccine, the pemphigus eruptions healed in 2 days. The infected miliaria lasted slightly longer.
　Severe stubborn nasal catarrh resisted ordinary medicines (eucalyptus oil collargol solution), and transplantation specifically showed streptococci, so when streptococcal filtrate was instilled into the nasal cavity, it disappeared in several days.

　Observation II　Child Hélène H... born July 10, 1925, admitted to the Children's Relief Hospital (Parrot Ward) on August 18 for an abscess occurring near the left medial condyle; edema existed from the dorsum of the foot, front of the shin, to the knee. The abscess showing soft points formed a fistula the next day; edema and redness continued; body temperature persisted at 38.8°.
　When treated with bouillon-vaccine, the swelling over the edema disappeared, and complete healing was obtained in 5 days.
　October 15, the child who had shown indigestion all summer was in a state of second-degree malnutrition; the fat layer of abdomen and limbs had disappeared. The child newly presented pyodermatitis with multiple skin or subcutaneous abscesses on the hair-bearing skin; a massive tumor with extremely poor boundaries developed in the neck and back, edematous swelling extended throughout the neck area and further reached the lateral temporal region; bleeding was noted in the left earlobe. This is an abscess of hair-bearing skin in the malnourished, which Marfan considers particularly severe and often fatal. Incision was made; serous hemorrhagic fluid flowed out, and examination of its contents on glass slides and further culture revealed the presence of staphylococci.
　Through the action of bandaging with staphylococcal filtrate, the edematous swelling of neck and hair-bearing areas disappeared, pus was eliminated at the incision site; healing of the infiltrative abscess was obtained in 3 days.

　Observation III　Child Georgette L... born February 5, 1925, admitted to the Children's Relief Hospital (infectious disease ward) in early April 1925 for measles complicated by bronchial pneumonia.
　Within several days, small vesicles of pustular pyodermatitis developed on the forehead and right temporal region; vaccine-containing pomade was used on these: namely a mixture of lanolin and staphylococcal filtrate.
　Daily improvement of the lesions was recognized. On the 6th day, the pustular rash disappeared, dried, and was covered with crusts.
　There was a rash on the right upper eyelid where pomade could not be applied, which served as a control. Its inflammatory symptoms continued, forming small sacs containing pus, clearly distinguishable from the others.

　Observation IV　Jeannine S... born August 26, 1925, admitted to the Children's Relief Hospital (Pavillon Pasteur) on November 10, 1925. The reason for admission was that the child was not developing and had eruptions on the body,

severe heat rashes due to excessive sweating. This was rickets: craniotabes and beaded ribs. The child showed a massive abscess on the left buttock.
　When treated with bouillon-vaccine, the pyodermatitis lesions healed, and discharge was achieved on November 23, 1925.

　　　　　　　　　　　　Impetigo
　　　　　　　　　　　　Impétigo

　This infection, initially derived from staphylococci, often develops secondary infections with various bacteria. Local application of appropriate antivirus is the treatment of choice; in this case, a course of about 10 days is rarely exceeded.

　Observation I　M.S.S.B... following a knife wound received on the left ear, developed impetigo with ulcers and characteristic crusts on the auricle, mastoid process, and parotid region.
　From March 15 to March 20, 1924, vaccine was applied 3 times, leading to complete cure. After the first application, crusts separated; on March 20, all areas showed epithelialization.

　Observation II　M.G.G... cabinetmaker, frequently injured his fingers with wood fragments, sometimes developing ulcerative large pustular rash at injury sites, requiring cessation of all work. We had the opportunity to see this in March 1924—a suppurative pustular rash that had been present for a month with no improvement.
　After applying vaccine 3 times at 2-day intervals, it healed completely. The patient returned a year and a half after vaccine application; despite continuing work that frequently caused skin trauma, no further lesions developed.

　Observation III　Miss P.V... a young patient who had surgery for suppurative mastoiditis for 6 months, developed two impetigo-like lesions on hair-bearing skin: about 1 cm² on the forehead and 3-4 cm² on the occiput. Since February, these lesions showed no tendency to heal.
　We applied bouillon-vaccine to the forehead every other day from March 20 to 28, 1924, achieving healing; applied to the occipital lesion from March 20 to April 8 with similar results.

138　　　　　　　　　　Role of Skin in Infection and Immunity
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
The functions of skin do not stop here. The skin breathes. The skin absorbs. The skin regulates temperature changes. Even mentioning only its main functions, the skin alleviates shock.

In certain species, cutaneous respiration, if we may call it so, is the only one that enters into calculation. Also in frogs and reptiles, the exchange between the skin and the external environment seems to adequately substitute for pulmonary respiration.

In warm-blooded animals it is not the same. Humans, for example, reduce about 1/67 of their body weight transcutaneously within 24 hours. In adults, of this average 1 kilogram loss, the excreted carbon dioxide weighs only 5 to 10 grams; the remainder is attributed to water evaporation. In humans and mammals, the skin has quite limited significance as a respiratory organ. It is nonetheless true that the skin has sensitivity to emit carbon dioxide and absorb oxygen from the air.

The skin allows passage of all kinds of gases and volatile substances. One knows Bichat's old experiment: a limb was placed in an atmosphere of putrefactive gas. After some time the gas was absorbed through the skin surface and excreted through the intestinal tract.

Because of this absorptive capacity, the only practically important question was found to be how the skin generally acts toward water and liquids. A long-disputed question has now been resolved and has become a matter of negative significance. Today it seems established that normal human skin does not absorb water. Patients who had been immersed in bathtubs for a week and even months constantly felt thirst, and to the same degree as those living in free air. The same applies to aqueous solutions of salt, medicines, and poisons: that is, healthy skin absorbs none of these substances.

The impermeability of skin covering is largely due to sebum, the fatty product secreted by sebaceous glands. By closing the mouths of pores and oiling the epidermis, sebum makes skin tissue impermeable. Thus, sebum creates a barrier in water that can hardly be crossed under normal conditions.

The phenomenon of absorption changes fundamentally when the skin is not in a normal state. The result

is that when applying compresses, if contact between skin and water is prolonged beyond certain limits, the epithelium stops absorbing liquid and swells. The epithelial barrier breaks down and becomes somewhat permeable. Further penetration into deeper parts occurs when the outer skin is compromised, for example when vigorously rubbing hair-rich areas. Friction applied over hair causes ulceration; this is sufficient to allow liquid absorption through the skin, even if not visible to the naked eye.

Sebaceous substances defend skin tissue against invasion by foreign matter, but have other non-negligible functions: namely, they prevent skin drying and thus allow the skin to maintain its sensitivity.

Sweat glands also contribute similarly: namely, the constant evaporation occurring on the skin surface keeps the skin constantly moist; this produces its flexibility and ability to recognize fine stimuli coming from the external world.

Sweat glands have other primarily important functions: namely, ensuring regulation of animal body fluids. Sweat secretion increases with temperature; it is the sweat glands that correct the harm caused by rising ambient temperature.

The purely mechanical significance of skin covering has no value from the standpoint of natural immunity. Through pressure exerted on skin capillaries, the various layers constituting this outer skin create obstacles to excessive exudation. On the other hand, the stratum corneum, upper epithelial cells, and elastic mobile dermis combine to constitute armor that can soften external impacts.

Regarding the important functions attributed to skin tissue, it is difficult to understand with the concept of a mere sac protecting organs like a defensive sheath. When considering the complex structure of epithelium and dermis, namely recognizing there all kinds of cells—nervous, blood, lymphatic, glandular, connective tissue and muscular elements, as well as special cells not mentioned before, setting these aside—being rich in such various cells cannot be prevented from being considered as an indicator of complex functions, some of which are probably still unknown.

In invertebrates, natural defense mechanisms are simple: namely, in the great majority the body surface is covered with a more or less hard and thick chitin layer.

In vertebrates, at least some species have skin similarly covered with an impermeable sheath.

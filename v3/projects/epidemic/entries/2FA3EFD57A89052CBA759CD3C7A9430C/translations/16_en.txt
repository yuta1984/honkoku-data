8　　　　Bactericidal Power of Leukocytes
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
　To avoid the opposition his predecessors had encountered, Schattenfroh experimented by placing leukocytes in unrelated media such as physiological saline solution instead of animal serum.
Through various manipulations—which we will not emphasize here—he concluded that it is leukocytes that accumulate almost all the bactericidal power present in blood. He observed that serum becomes bactericidal only after the death of leukocytes. Of course, leukocytes can be produced in the living body of animals, that is, in their physiological state. By heating leukocytes at 60° for 23 minutes, or by immersing them for 2 to 3 hours after grinding, Schattenfroh succeeded in obtaining a liquid that conferred very strong bactericidal power; this ability disappeared with heating at 80°-87°.

　The attempt to lead this problem into the realm of physics or chemistry by creating leukocyte extracts faced results that were difficult to interpret, as we will describe later. We shall now mention here the existence of numerous bactericidal substances. Besides Buchner's alexin, which disappears at 55°, we know today that Löwit's leukocyte extract resists boiling, Jacob's has an unknown destruction temperature, Schattenfroh's extract is destroyed only at 80°-87°, and needless to say, that obtained by Bail's leucocidine method does not resist 65°.
　Should we conclude from this the differential nature of bactericidal substances existing simultaneously within leukocytes? Should we attribute the blame to the defects of our extraction methods?
　According to Bail, each of the enumerated extracts represents a single bactericidal agent with its own specific characteristics. This is not our feeling. These extracts, taken in combination or separately, do not seem to us to be true substances from leukocytes. The bactericidal substances contained within leukocyte protoplasm are certainly not of such simple chemical structure as to be extracted by the primitive methods used to date. We merely know how highly sensitive leukocyte protoplasm is to physical and chemical elements, and how complex the workings of this microcosm are to assume that simply grinding with glass powder and letting it decay in chloroform or physiological saline solution would be sufficient to extract the active molecules of leukocytes in a pure state.

　Would it not be better to attempt to study more thoroughly the reactions of living leukocytes to physical and chemical elements before beginning the extraction methods that must necessarily be experienced? After learning what their behavior is toward various temperatures and other elements in various media, we believe this should be combined with rational extraction methods.

　Judging from the results listed above, the authors show much interest in the bactericidal power of leukocytes and less interest in their necessary characteristic of digestive power. The concept of bactericidal power has come to dominate virtually the entire problem of immunity, to the extent that leukocytes are believed to have the mission of encompassing bacteria and particularly killing them. Now that we know that cells or toxic products of all kinds undergo similar phagocytic action from leukocytes, bactericidal power is merely regarded as one stage of phagocytic action in higher animals, like the preliminary salivary digestion and subsequent gastrointestinal digestion. This last way of thinking would have the advantage of broadening the scope of research, bringing research into the realm of digestive enzymes, and making us approach more closely the biological phenomena that exist in nature.

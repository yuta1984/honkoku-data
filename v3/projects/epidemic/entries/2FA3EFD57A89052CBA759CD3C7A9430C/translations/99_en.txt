　Chills and rigors. After preliminary examination of the uterus confirmed no placental fragments or membrane fragments, gauze was inserted into the uterus. At 2 AM, severe rigors, pulse uncountable; camphor oil, 20cc.
　May 8, morning, 39°; pulse 120, palpable. General condition improving. No new rigors. Urticaria over entire body. Evening, temperature 38.2°; pulse 110 Second tampon performed. Patient was able to sleep without anxiety.
　May 9, temperature 37.2°; pulse 98 New generalized urticaria appeared. Bouillon taste in mouth. Evening, 36.9°; pulse 88. Third tampon performed.
　May 10, temperature 36.9°; pulse 80. Subsequently became completely normal. On the 20th day, got out of bed in good general condition.
　
　Observation IV　M, 29 years old; gravida 4 para 4. Delivery at home for 5 days. March 28, 1925, transported to Saint-Antoine maternity hospital due to massive uterine hemorrhage. Numerous small fragments over the entire placental attachment surface were removed. Bleeding continued and was massive. Intrauterine tampon with antiseptic gauze was performed. Two days later, i.e., afternoon of the 8th day after delivery, temperature rose to 38.8°, then to 39.5°, further to 40°. First intrauterine tampon with filtrate was performed. Lochia was collected and cultured, showing pure streptococcal culture. General condition was concerning. Facial spasms, lead-colored. Excitement and depression alternated.
　9th day: temperature 39°; afternoon temperature 39.9°. Second tampon. General condition clearly improving.
　10th day: temperature 37.3°; afternoon temperature 38.3°. Markedly improving. Third tampon.
　From the following day, temperature fluctuated between 37.5° and 38.4°; then became completely afebrile on the 15th day. Patient was discharged recovered at 3 weeks.

　Observation V　F.C., gravida 2 para 2, 25 years old. Menstruation delayed by 2.5 months.
　October 24, 1925, uterine bleeding: fetal expulsion.
　25th, severe chills and rigors; 26th, several episodes of chills and rigors, each lasting 5 minutes. Patient was admitted to Saint-Antoine maternity hospital. On admission, temperature 40.7°; pulse 120. Immediate curettage and placental removal. Culture: pure hemolytic streptococcal culture. Intrauterine tampon with filtrate.
　27th, temperature 36.8°; pulse 88. Second tampon removed after 24 hours. Became afebrile. Discharged on the 8th day.
　Important and particularly numerous studies have recently been conducted at Saint-Antoine maternity hospital regarding early treatment of puerperal fever infections.
　This study was conducted on 3,010 deliveries performed at the hospital, and 1,244 deliveries that began at home and were then sent to the hospital's isolation ward. Treatment uses intrauterine tampons with streptococcal antivirus

　These tampons are left in place for 24 hours, then renewed for 3 consecutive days.
　Preventively, antivirus tampons were used in cases of difficult delivery (forceps extraction, uterine inclination, artificial delivery, placenta previa, etc.). Of 35 cases, 35 were successful. One case was particularly interesting: after 101 hours of labor, two attempts at forceps use, and one craniotomy, the temperature did not exceed 37.7° and required 48 hours of bed rest to return to normal.
　Therapeutically, tampon use involves intrauterine tampons with antivirus immediately after delivery when symptoms of intrauterine infection already exist. Of 21 cases, 20 were successful; the only failure was observed in a woman presenting symptoms of generalized peritonitis; this case, however, did not fall within the normal scope of the treatment.
　Secondary and late treatment tampons were performed 3-4 days after birth or one week after delivery. Of 16 treatment cases, 16 were successful.
　Tampons for retained membranes were performed in 8 cases; this is always important and sometimes causes complete retention. In all cases, after the second or third tampon, temperature returned to normal and local uterine condition was seen to recover extremely rapidly.
　Finally, of 10 cases of abortion that developed sepsis, all 10 treated with antivirus were successful.
　When considering that very reliable statistics show an average 40% morbidity rate under similar conditions, it will be recognized that all results obtained at Saint-Antoine Hospital's maternity ward deserve our attention.

　Observation I　Primipara. On delivery day, temperature 38.9°. By the next day, abdomen was distended, tense, and painful. On the 3rd day and the following day, large amounts of brownish secretions with obvious putrid odor.
　7th day, sutures used for perineal repair were removed; before that, there was a large wound covered with suppurating membrane and necrotic tissue; the wound base was congested and infiltrated; surroundings showed marked edema. The cervix had numerous lacerations covered with necrotic tissue. The uterus secreted large amounts of purulent fluid:

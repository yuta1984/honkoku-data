been immunized by this method. To definitively determine its value in humans, perhaps the necessary period of observation may still be lacking. What can be established now is that oral immunization never causes the slightest harm, and when implemented together with subcutaneous injection, the results were hardly inferior to those obtained by conventional vaccination methods.

While not opposing the principle of oral immunization, a question that still remains reserved is: what particularly should be required is whether the addition of bile is necessary—which has now become an established fact—in humans who are highly susceptible to typhus bacilli or cholera vibrios, as is the case with laboratory animals that do not acquire immunity without sensitization.

Theoretically, this reservation was supported: in practice there are numerous facts to the contrary. Here I will cite facts recently observed.

At the end of September 1925, one typhus patient appeared at the tuberculosis sanatorium in Roscoff. Immediately, all the children and nurses at this sanatorium were given oral preventive vaccination. However, they neglected to perform the preliminary sensitization method with bile. Within the month of receiving preventive vaccination, 9 typhus patients were reported among those who had taken the vaccine. In October, 10 other children became ill. The same policy of preventive administration was followed. Among those last vaccinated 12 days later, one typhus patient was identified.

This failure was attributed to the value of the oral preventive method; in practice, what should be blamed is the technique. Humans who take typhus or cholera preventive vaccine without sensitization become like the rabbits in our experiments: that is, immunity is not established. The vaccine slides down along the intestinal tract and is excreted from the body without making contact with receptive cells.

Administration of typhus or cholera preventive "bili-vaccine" has already been extensively performed.

Regarding vaccination methods against cholera, it had not been very long since its use began. Here I will briefly summarize a few records reported during epidemics that occurred in India:

　　　　　Oral Immunization Against Dysentery, Typhus, and Cholera　　　　203
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

a) At the end of November 1925, a severe epidemic broke out in the region of Pondichéry; it continued throughout December and ended in early January 1926. Therefore, this epidemic was short in duration: about 40 days. There were many victims: 831 deaths among 1,039 patients.

At the beginning of the epidemic, part of the population was vaccinated. A total of 5,200 people were immunized orally after pretreatment with bile. Here, according to the health department's report to the Colonial Minister, I will describe what the final outcome in this region was:

"Among the 5,200 people who took bili-vaccine against cholera, only 2 deaths were recorded in those who were undoubtedly already in the incubation period. Among the police officers particularly exposed to infection, only 1 became ill; this police officer was on leave at the time of vaccination and did not take it."

b) Many cholera outbreaks were recently observed in Rajbari and its vicinity. Here I summarize what was confirmed at the end of the epidemic:

Before vaccination was implemented, 41 patients and 23 deaths were reported among a population of 8,680.

693 people were vaccinated. The epidemic continued and still produced victims; after vaccination implementation, 41 new cholera patients and 17 deaths were still recorded.

However, all these new patients occurred among non-vaccinated individuals. Not a single person among those orally immunized became ill.

c) Comparative trials of oral and subcutaneous vaccination methods against cholera were conducted in India under the direction of A. I. H. Russell. The cholera prevention work began at the end of 1925 and continued until the beginning of 1927. This was carried out among Indians living under the same conditions in terms of nutrition and hygiene.

Subcutaneous vaccination was performed in 236 villages; oral "bili-vaccine" inoculation in 52 villages; in 72 villages, both were used simultaneously.

Here I will present the main results extracted from the report published by the League of Nations (end of October 1927).

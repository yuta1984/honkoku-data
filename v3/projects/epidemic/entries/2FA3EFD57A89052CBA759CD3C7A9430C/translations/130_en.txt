　　"No one has ever proven in an undeniable manner the development of solid immunity
　　without the manifestation of antibodies." Jules Bordet (Traité de Physiologie normale et
　　pathologique, by H. Roger and Binet, 1927, p. 354)

Our knowledge concerning the mechanisms of immunity, which cannot be denied from an experimental standpoint, is still based on observations subject to controversy. Despite the classical research of Metchnikoff, Bordet, Ehrlich and others, immunological theory is still in its growth phase today, and we cannot foresee future stability. We too must feel that we can easily express some private opinions.

At any time, those who attempted to treat so-called infectious or "miasmatic" diseases necessarily determined that it was essential to directly target the elements that should be expected as the causes of these diseases; they hardly considered the body in which the disease develops as an issue. Already when Hiéronyme Fracastor recommended inhalation and application of mercury for syphilis, he held this therapeutic concept: in his view, mercury removed from the skin should destroy the syphilis pathogen, which was then considered a skin disease, when passing through the pores.

Four centuries later, when the bacteriological era arrived, it brought no recognizable change to this method of treating infectious diseases; there was no other concept than pathogens that took more concrete forms. Jewish physicians and surgeons then confronted each other in the search for substances most certain to kill bacteria easily.

Metchnikoff's discovery of phagocytosis resulted in turning the struggle against infectious diseases in another direction. In his research, he learned that within the organism itself there exists innately an apparatus capable of exerting bactericidal action against viruses.

As is known, it was Bordet who very clearly defined the boundary between the domain of phagocytic cells and the humoral domain.

Even closer to us, there was an era that advocated humoral bactericidal action to explain the mechanisms of natural immunity.

Behring did not believe that immunity against anthrax in mice was due to the bacteriolytic action of serum against anthrax bacilli; did he not argue that this was the key to the foundation of all immunity?

Today, Behring's concept belongs to history. We know that in the majority of cases, natural immunity arises from phagocytic action.

In the case of acquired immunity, certainly, the practical relationship with phagocytic cells cannot be denied, but its significance is even weaker than in the case of natural immunity. According to the doctrine that has the most supporters today, what stands in first place is humoral power; "acquired immunity is a result that arises essentially from the development of inherently specific antibodies that appear in the blood" (Bordet).

Bacteriolytic action today has been attributed, since Bordet, to the cooperative action of two substances: on one hand specific complement-fixing substances and on the other hand non-specific alexin (aggressive substance). "Alexin represents, so to speak, a kind of weapon that normal animals already possess, but when this substance coexists with certain complement-fixing substances, its action becomes even more pronounced, so that thereafter, thanks to antibodies from vaccine injection, it specifically targets the bacteria against which the animal has been immunized" (Bordet).

The theory of dual substances generally accepted today, as is known, originated from Bordet's memorable research on hemolysin; from this, the theory was transplanted to the field of antibacterial immunity. According to what the originator tells us, "hemolytic serum corresponds extremely well to anti-cholera serum in its composition and in its mode of action." Its

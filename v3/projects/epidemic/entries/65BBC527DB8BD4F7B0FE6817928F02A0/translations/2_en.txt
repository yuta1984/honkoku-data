Physicians who wish to perform smallpox vaccination should apply to the former Tōkō (Eastern School), undergo examination, and receive a license. However, there are now many physicians in various prefectures who have received such licenses. From now on, when disciples report to their jurisdictional office that they have learned and practiced the technique from a licensed physician, local officials shall conduct examinations within their authority and grant practice licenses if there are no unsuitable circumstances.

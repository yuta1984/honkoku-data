We trust that you continue in good health,
which is indeed a matter of great joy. Last year
in the fourth month, when there was an incident at Shimabara,
you kindly sent an envoy to inquire
about our situation and showed such consideration, for which we are
deeply grateful. In appreciation of this kindness,
we send this envoy to express our gratitude.

While matters beyond help are naturally 
unavoidable, if there are further misunderstandings
and such, it will not suffice, so
although regulations for clothing and such
have been established beforehand, following those precepts
proves insufficient. First and foremost,
spending money on unnecessary

banquets with food and drink,
and coming to regard the way of frugality
as something base—
from such circumstances, imperceptibly one arrives at
daily privation, so even if one has
such intentions,
naturally military preparations and such will be inadequate.

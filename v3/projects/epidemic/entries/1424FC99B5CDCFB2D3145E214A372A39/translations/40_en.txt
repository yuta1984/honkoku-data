Petition Statement Record
　　Regarding my son Gendatsu, [I wished for him] to
　　study medicine in Edo, and requested
　　a three-year leave of absence in the past
　　year of the Dog. The request was
　　granted as petitioned, for which I am most grateful. However,
　　at that time, I petitioned to receive

　　provisions for one person while in that place.
　　However, due to the official system, it was decreed
　　that those who had been studying thus far should return
　　before being sent out again, so
　　I have been waiting and observing the situation. Gradually,
　　as he grows older, I believe the optimal time
　　for study will pass us by.

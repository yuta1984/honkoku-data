This is what we now call measles (hashika), as can be seen in scholarly explanations. Even though we speak of smallpox and measles, things that don't resemble them may also be smallpox and measles. To give an example of things that have the same appearance but different hearts: they are like narcissus and green onions, or like an honest person and a half-honest person. However, since the common people think they are similar things, they compare this to iris and kakitsubata flowers, making smallpox the "beauty determiner" and measles the "life determiner." Measles is not a life determiner. Smallpox should be the life determiner. Be that as it may, do people nowadays think that in addition to the smallpox god on their household altars, there is also a measles god? That Genpachi and Sairoku are frightening each other about being possessed is absurd.

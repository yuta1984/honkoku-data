Rock sugar, white sugar (large amounts are not good), dried bonito flakes, dried sardines
Abalone, oysters, Japanese whiting, halfbeak
Sea robin, red gurnard, sea bream (During smallpox days 7-8, cook in light miso and give. After the 9th day, strictly prohibit.)

Foods good after smallpox (Give after 15 days/after scabs fall off. If there is residual toxicity, depending on symptoms, some items should be prohibited even after scabs fall off.)
Tea, black beans (roasted beans and bean powder are not good), sweet bean paste (do not give in large amounts), kashiwa mochi
Azuki beans, white cowpeas, yae-nari, green peas
Barley, wheat, buckwheat, udon
Millet, sorghum, foxtail millet, taro (good after 21 days)
Carrot, Chinese cabbage, garland chrysanthemum, yomena
Lotus root, broad beans, sword beans, lettuce
Turnip, winter melon, luffa, kelp
Flounder, sole, carp, ark shell
Shark, rockfish (small ones are good), crucian carp (avoid for those with diarrhea)
Eel (small ones are good. Large ones are toxic and should not be given. Avoid for those with diarrhea.)
Hard clam (good after 30 days), corbicula clam (good after 30 days), duck (good for those who have returned to normal)

Other than the items listed above, during the 100 days after smallpox, strictly prohibit giving anything else. For infants who drink milk, wet nurses should also carefully observe the same prohibitions.

The timing for sake-yu (bathing) is around 14-15 days from initial onset. Depending on the density and severity, it is good to perform sake-yu on the 10th, 12th, 15th, 18th, 21st, or 25th day. Common people sometimes believe it should be limited to the 12th day, but this is a great error. Even if eruptions have formed scabs, if internal symptoms are not stable, never rush the sake-yu. If too early, it will turn malignant. One must be cautious. Only when smallpox scabs have already formed and the pus has dried, becoming yellow, red, and black, and when touched by hand feels rough and sticky

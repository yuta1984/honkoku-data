...and there is never a moment of quiet. The child cannot sleep well and is easily startled. Also, eruptions on the hands and feet tend to be rubbed and broken, leading to suppuration. Especially when going here and there, the patient is easily exposed to wind and cold. Therefore, even for urination and defecation, use a chamber pot indoors in summer and beside the kotatsu in winter. One must carefully guard against wind and cold.

○During smallpox, massaging the body, hands and feet is extremely bad. This should be strictly avoided.

○Worshipping the smallpox deity also occurs in China. Since all gods dislike impurity, setting aside whether gods truly exist or not, if one believes that a god resides in the smallpox patient's room, one will naturally be mindful of cleanliness and thus will not be infected by impure qi. However, relying solely on the gods while neglecting medical treatment is extremely foolish.

○Things that should be avoided in all aspects in a smallpox household are as follows:

1. Avoiding wind, cold, impure qi, and unclean things is most crucial.
1. People with body odor must not enter the sickroom.
1. Do not engage in sexual activity within the room.
1. Avoid the sweat smell of people who come hurriedly from distant places.
1. Avoid the smell from pumping sewage from ditches, latrines, etc.
1. Dislike the smell of women's menstruation and postpartum impurity of newly delivered women.
1. Avoid the smell of people suffering from malignant sores and clothing stained with pus.
1. Avoid the smell of burning mosquitoes, burning hair, and also the smell when oil lamps, candles, or paper torches are blown out.
1. Avoid the smell of sulfur, musk, borneol, and incense.

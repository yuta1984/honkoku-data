7. The disinfection time requires contact with steam at 100 degrees Celsius for one hour or more.

(E) Chemical disinfection

A. Carbolic acid
Preparation of carbolic acid water: Carbolic acid is the most widely used disinfectant, forming white needle-shaped crystals. Although it changes to reddish-brown when exposed to light, there is no change in its disinfective power. For disinfection purposes, a twenty-fold dilution is used (crystalline carbolic acid 5 parts, hydrochloric acid 1 part, water 94 parts). The preparation method is as follows: first, dissolve one bottle (containing one pound) of crystalline epidemic prevention carbolic acid by the furnace or in hot water, transfer this to a large container, add a small amount of water (dissolution is faster if warm water is used), and stir well or shake

vigorously (when using a bottle), then add a small amount of water again and stir or shake. Repeating this many times, when 4 sho 7 go 5 shaku of water is added (strictly speaking it should be like this, but ordinarily it is acceptable to remember it as 5 sho of water to 1 pound of carbolic acid. Since a standard bucket holds 5 sho of water, dissolving 1 pound of carbolic acid in one bucketful of water will yield twenty-fold carbolic acid water), the initially white turbid liquid becomes transparent. Furthermore, adding about 4 shaku (78 cubic centimeters) of pure hydrochloric acid will yield the required twenty-fold carbolic acid water. Carbolic acid water prepared with hydrochloric acid added has much stronger disinfective power compared to carbolic acid water without hydrochloric acid.

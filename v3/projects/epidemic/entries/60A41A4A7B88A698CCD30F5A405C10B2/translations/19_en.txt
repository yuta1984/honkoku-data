Prodromal period: This may be absent, or there may be several days of abnormal bowel movements, or rarely complaints of fatigue, loss of appetite, tongue coating, vomiting, abdominal rumbling and pain, etc.

Onset: Begins with several episodes of diarrhea, gradually increasing in frequency to several dozen times per day, in severe cases reaching over one hundred times. The stool contains mucus and blood, and during defecation there is abdominal rumbling, abdominal pain, tenderness in the left lower abdomen, and tenesmus (the condition where despite having a bowel movement, the urge to defecate does not stop and there is pain in the anal region). In mild cases, there is no fever and appetite is not affected, with recovery in a few days. In moderate cases, body temperature reaches around 38 degrees, with loss of appetite, nausea, gastric distress, headache, etc., healing after one to two weeks. In severe cases, there is high fever from the initial stage with general distress and headache complaints. Urine output decreases and appetite is lost. Stool becomes putrid flesh-like with severe odor. Thus some die within one to two days. In pediatric dysentery, fever is severe with convulsions and vomiting. Bowel movements are completely absent or there are only one to two episodes of diarrhea per day (mucous stool or mucous bloody stool). Some die within twelve to forty-eight hours after onset.

Diagnosis: When the aforementioned symptoms are complete, diagnosis is easy, but when symptoms are mild, differentiation from simple intestinal catarrh can be difficult. In pediatric dysentery, it is often misdiagnosed as meningitis. Also, small intestinal dysentery or cecal dysentery has symptoms quite similar to typhoid fever, making it nearly impossible to determine which condition it is. In such cases, bacteriological examination of feces must be relied upon. The Widal reaction does not appear in the early stage as it does in typhoid fever, so cases where it can be applied for diagnosis are relatively few.

Immunity: Even after contracting this disease once, immunity is not maintained for long. Sometimes

The cause of dysentery prevalent in tropical regions is not dysentery bacilli but rather protozoa called dysentery amoeba.

Resistance: Compared to typhoid bacilli, they are somewhat weaker in some respects, but are roughly similar.

Predisposing factors: Overeating and overdrinking, consumption of spoiled food or unripe fruits, constipation, cooling of the abdomen, etc.

Nests of dysentery bacilli: (1) Dysentery patients (2) Dysentery bacilli carriers (3) Excreta

There are three types of dysentery bacilli carriers, as follows:
(a) Some have been proven to excrete the bacilli in feces for nineteen days after recovery from dysentery. However, it appears that some cases may extend for several months.
(b) Those who recovered from mild dysentery without receiving a diagnosis of dysentery, and many of these continue to excrete the bacilli.

(c) Some who are completely healthy yet still excrete the bacilli.

The only dangerous excreta are feces, because the route by which dysentery bacilli are excreted from the body is solely through feces.

Route of dysentery transmission: Same as in the case of typhoid fever.

Intestinal lesions: In this disease, lesions appear mainly in the rectum and its upper part (left lower abdomen). However, cases where the small intestine is also affected are not uncommon, especially in children. The changes initially involve congestion and swelling of the mucosa, with countless small hemorrhagic spots appearing in various places. Subsequently, membranous material forms on the mucosal surface, becoming scab-like. The scabs eventually slough off to form ulcers, and finally heal with scar formation.

Symptoms: Incubation period: Usually two to three days, but may also be three to eight days

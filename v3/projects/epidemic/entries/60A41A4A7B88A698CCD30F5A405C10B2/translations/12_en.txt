　Bacilli and spirilla first increase in length and divide at the center into two organisms. The divided organisms then immediately grow and divide further. Cocci initially become short rod-shaped and then divide at the center. When nutrition, temperature, and other conditions are suitable, they continuously divide and reproduce in this manner. While the speed of reproduction varies, generally one bacterium will increase to approximately 34 billion organisms within twelve hours.

　　　Specific Diseases
　　　　Typhoid Fever

Cause　Caused by the typhoid bacillus discovered by Dr. Eberth from the corpse of a typhoid patient thirty-two years ago. This bacillus is a medium-sized rod-shaped bacterium with blunt rounded ends (Figure 1). Around the bacterial body are ten to twelve flagella (Figure 2), which enable active movement.

Resistance　Temperature―Dies when heated to 60 degrees Celsius for half an hour to one hour　Drying―There are cases of survival for 87 days when attached to military uniforms, and 60 to 70 days when attached to linen cloth　Sunlight―Cannot resist direct sunlight for long periods　Chemical solutions―Dies within half an hour in 1:1000 mercuric chloride solution and 1:20 carbolic acid solution　In feces―Survives for four months　In buried corpses―The bacillus can still be detected three months later　In soil―Survives for three to five months. Some have proven survival for eleven months　In water―Survival period varies greatly depending on surrounding conditions such as water flow, water quality, and temperature. Previously it was believed that this bacillus could not survive more than two to three weeks in water, but recent research has proven it can survive much longer　In milk―Lives for 21 to 35 days

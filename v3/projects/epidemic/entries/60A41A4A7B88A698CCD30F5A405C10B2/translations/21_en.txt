(2) Indirect transmission - When pseudomembranes or secretions are attached to eating utensils, clothing, toys, etc. used by patients, healthy persons introduce the pathogenic agent into their mouth and nose through these items or through hands that have touched such items. Furthermore, these bacteria can mix with dust particles and spread through the air, causing transmission.

Symptoms: Incubation period - 2 to 7 days

Onset: Often begins with chills or shivering, body temperature rises, and pain develops in the throat area, especially during swallowing. When examining the throat by opening the mouth and pressing down the tongue, both tonsils (Figure 6) show redness and swelling with grayish-white pseudomembranes or yellow secretions visible. These are symptoms of pharyngeal diphtheria, but when laryngeal diphtheria (also called laryngeal croup) subsequently develops, the voice becomes hoarse and a characteristic barking cough occurs. Inspiration becomes prolonged and takes on a particular sound. Thus respiratory difficulty increases and eventually leads to death by suffocation.

Diagnosis: When the aforementioned symptoms are pronounced, diagnosis will not be mistaken, but when they are not clear, confirmation can be obtained through bacterial examination of the pseudomembranes.

Immunity: After contracting the disease, a certain immunity is acquired, but its duration varies from person to person. Therefore, reinfection occurs, and in extreme cases, there are examples of contracting this disease three times in one year.

Scarlet Fever

Cause: Not yet clear.

Location of pathogen: The pathogen likely exists in the skin (vesicular fluid, desquamation) and in the mucus of the throat, nasal cavity, etc., and furthermore adheres to various surrounding objects, maintaining infectious capacity for a long time.

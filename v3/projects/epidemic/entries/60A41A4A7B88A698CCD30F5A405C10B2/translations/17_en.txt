When mailing, it is necessary to write on the container "examination material enclosed, Dr. So-and-so, pharmacist So-and-so, or such-and-such municipal office/police station."

Immunity: Once one has contracted this disease, immunity is acquired, so reinfection is rare. However, it is not absolutely impossible.

Paratyphoid

Cause: Caused by paratyphoid bacilli (medium-sized rod bacteria) discovered by Achard and Bensaude in 1896 (Meiji 29).

Symptoms: Generally resembles typhoid fever of somewhat mild severity. Sometimes it may present symptoms somewhat different from typhoid fever, but since it is extremely difficult to confirm diagnosis of this disease based on symptoms alone, in doubtful cases one must rely on bacteriological diagnosis (vesicant fluid and feces/urine examination, etc.).

Transmission relations and other aspects are almost the same as typhoid fever.

Dysentery

Cause: Caused by dysentery bacilli (rod bacteria somewhat shorter than typhoid bacilli, having no flagella (Figure 4) and therefore no motility) discovered by Dr. Shiga during the dysentery epidemic in Tokyo in Meiji 30 (1897). However, subsequent research has revealed that dysentery bacilli are not limited to the single Shiga bacillus (prototype bacillus), but that so-called variant strains exist with somewhat different characteristics. Also, mainly

(A) Sunlight exposure: When tatami mats, furniture, etc. with attached pathogens are exposed to direct sunlight (light on cloudy days or light through shoji screens has weak power) for several hours, the purpose of disinfection can be somewhat achieved. Furthermore, if this is repeated for several days, it will be even better. However, the bactericidal action of sunlight only acts on the surface and has the defect of not reaching deep parts. Therefore, this method should be used as an auxiliary method to ensure the effectiveness after performing other disinfection methods, and it is inappropriate to think that the purpose of disinfection can be achieved by sunlight exposure alone.

(B) Incineration method: This method can certainly achieve the purpose of disinfection, but it should only be applied to items that are inexpensive and not intended for practical use again after disinfection, or items where the cost of disinfection would be higher than the value of the items themselves. When incinerating, care should be taken to burn completely leaving no remainder. The cremation of corpses from infectious diseases is nothing other than the disinfection method by incineration.

(C) Boiling disinfection: Boiling disinfection is the simplest disinfection method. That is, it suffices to put items to be disinfected in vessels such as cauldrons or pots and boil them for a certain period of time.

1. Items suitable for boiling disinfection are as follows:
   (A) Glassware, ceramics, wooden products (chemical disinfection or steam disinfection may also be used depending on convenience)
   (B) Clothing, bedding, cloth pieces (when a steam disinfector is available, steam disinfection is preferable)

2. Inside the boiling cauldron, it is convenient to equip a suitable basket and put the items to be disinfected into it.

3. When boiling, all utensils should be submerged in water and covered with a lid.

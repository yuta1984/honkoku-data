Yet while people do not find it strange when one or two boils appear, why do they call it mysterious when many small pustules of smallpox appear? Should we call the many mysterious or the few mysterious? Moreover, why do they call it mysterious to suffer from smallpox pustules that have visible form, yet not find it mysterious when typhoid epidemics, having no form and being invisible to the eye, take people's lives? To use an analogy, this is like calling it mysterious when trees grow from planted seeds, while not calling it mysterious when clouds form in clear skies—it is laughable. Particularly, what both medical professionals and laypeople throughout history consider most mysterious is that this disease occurs only once in a lifetime. Since even the medical schools of past and present are completely ignorant of these matters, it is natural that common people do not understand them. The detailed reasoning will be recorded thoroughly later, and I will omit it here. First, the evidence that smallpox is not a disease caused by seasonal atmospheric influences, nor originally a disease arising from the qi of Japanese soil, can be found in Mount Ontake in Kiso, Shinano Province, and in the same province...

In China, it first spread and became epidemic when attacking barbarians in Nanyang during the first year of Jianwu under Emperor Yuan of Eastern Jin, hence it was named "barbarian pox" (ryōsō) as recorded in the book called "Elbow Reserve Emergency Prescriptions" (Chūgo-hō). Because its form resembled beans, it was also called "pea pustule pox" (entō-hōsō). Also because it resembled beans, the disease radical was added to create the character "tō" (痘). The common claim that it was transmitted during the Jianwu era of Emperor Guangwu of Later Han is probably an error due to the same era name. The theory by some that it was brought back when Zhang Qian of Former Han served as envoy to the Yuezhi Kingdom is a completely baseless claim.

In Japan, this disease first became epidemic in the seventh year of Tenpyō, year of the boar (735 CE), under Emperor Shōmu, as detailed in the "Continued Chronicles of Japan" (Shoku Nihongi). Twenty-nine years later, it became epidemic in the seventh year of Tenpyō-hōji, year of the rabbit (763 CE), under the deposed Emperor Ōi. Twenty-eight years later...

Smallpox and measles are malignant diseases with visible forms and odors that are easy to recognize. People become contaminated by these, suffer contagion, lose their lives, and become disabled. Such customs are truly beyond description in words. If you try asking blind people in the world, eight or nine out of ten are blind because smallpox destroyed their eyes.

It is extremely laughable.

The Origin of Measles
Measles, like smallpox, is a disease that did not exist in ancient times. Its beginning involved the transmission of poisonous qi from foreign lands from person to person, circulating through many great nations just as smallpox circles through provinces and counties, killing countless people throughout history. It is something entirely separate from seasonal epidemics. Because smallpox circulates through provinces and counties, its epidemics...

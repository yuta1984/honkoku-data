While residing in the medical academy, I already knew that Zenya was an extraordinary person. Moreover, the matter of avoiding smallpox, measles, and chickenpox concerns court deliberations and is not Zenya's personal opinion. Therefore, I do not refuse his request and add a few words to the beginning of this work.

Preface to the "Treatise on Severing Poison" in Japanese Script

1. Previously, I wrote the "Treatise on Severing Poison" and explained in detail methods for avoiding smallpox and measles, but since it was in classical Chinese, it was not easily readable by ordinary people. Since smallpox and measles are great calamities in human life, I desire to record an outline of the original Chinese text in Japanese script so that all people may understand it, and to make this public to the world.

1. As explained in this book, smallpox and measles are not seasonal epidemic diseases but contagious diseases similar to syphilis and scabies. If people throughout society uniformly understand and know this principle and come to detest and avoid these diseases, the root of toxic contagion will immediately be severed, and the great calamity of smallpox and measles will no longer exist in the world. This is my true intention in naming this work "Treatise on Severing Poison." Originally, lamenting that countless people throughout history have died untimely deaths due to these evil toxins, I took up my brush in indignation.

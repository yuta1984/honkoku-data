Végaraud (a physician) states: "Although some praise ammonium, it is not an appropriate medicine for this fever. If used recklessly, it will cause unstoppable sweating."

Chapter 37: Dosage Must Be Carefully Determined

The essence of treatment lies in ensuring that medicinal dosages are neither excessive nor insufficient. When pathogenic heat is intense, the harm is most severe. If the dosage is exceeded, the nervous system cannot overcome the medicinal effects, and even if it doesn't cause distension and convulsions, it will cause obstruction and discomfort, immediately bringing about fatal disaster. This is just like fire that blazes when it gets wind, but can also be extinguished by wind. How can one not think deeply about this?

Chapter 38: In Severe Cases, Change the Medicinal Formula

Medicine that once proved effective, when taken for several doses, becomes familiar to the body and loses its effect. This is like a person entering a fish market who naturally becomes unaware of the fishy smell. Physicians should observe the situation and adjust treatment accordingly, and must not cling to old methods and lose the opportunity for cure. Moreover, if medicine shows no effect but is still continued, it may sometimes cause harm. This is especially true for opium.

Chapter 39: In Severe Cases, Double the Dosage

When using stimulating medicines, if there are no signs of pathogenic heat dispersing during the period of procrastination and delay, and instead weakness and depletion increase, this may be because the disease is deep while the medicine is shallow. One should carefully consider and double the dosage. When physicians fail to properly assess the disease, lack comprehensive experience, develop doubts midway, and hastily consider other medicines, this is not the proper treatment method.

Pathogenic toxins and vital energy cannot coexist. When pathogenic forces are strong, vital energy becomes constricted and cannot expand. At precisely this moment, if one wishes to achieve victory through long-term strategy, merely discussing defensive retreat is enough to lose the opportunity. One should use elite forces to charge forward and quickly secure victory.

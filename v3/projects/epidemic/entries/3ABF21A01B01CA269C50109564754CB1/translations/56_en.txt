Cantharis is invasive, penetrating, and infiltrating, with a cruel toxicity in its nature, so it must not be used carelessly. When pathogenic factors lodge in the internal organs causing burning heat and drilling pain in those areas, and dispersing medications are ineffective with the condition about to transform into gangrene, it can be prescribed immediately.

Its formula:
Blistering Plaster (same as above) Main treatment: gastric pain and chest pain that are difficult to stop
Cantharis (cantharides) (fine powder, 32 sen) Yellow wax, Pine rosin (96 sen each)
Chicken fat (32 sen) Strong vinegar (56 sen)
Cook these over a gentle fire to make a plaster, then store it.

Usage: Spread on cotton cloth and apply to the affected area. However, it should not be applied to the lower limbs, as there is fear that the plaster marks might transform into gangrene.

Cantharis contains volatile salts in its nature (according to Blane's Pharmacology), and its nature is severe and harsh, capable of rushing forth to break bindings and restore paralysis. When combined with oil, its power is inferior; when combined with vinegar, its power is superior. Someone asks: how does cantharis produce blisters? The answer is: the acrid and harsh volatile salts enter through the absorbing vessels and immediately invade and irritate the nerves of the blood vessels. The nerves, sensing this, become startled and agitated, pouring and gathering water fluid to envelop the toxic salts and push them back out through the same route they entered. Cantharis does not have absorbing and drawing properties.

The pathogenic toxin attaches to the intestinal folds in seven to eight out of ten cases. If it attaches for one day, there is one day's harm; if for one hour, there is one hour's harm. This must not be taken lightly. If overlooked and time passes, calamity approaches with no time to take action.

From symptoms such as confused consciousness, severe headache, and abnormal eye conditions, one can see that pathogenic qi has invaded the brain. This corresponds to the various febrile diseases recorded in diagnostic texts, where flickering eyes are signs of brain membrane inflammation and swelling, eventually leading to mental derangement. The attachment of pathogenic qi to intestinal folds is a common problem of this fever, and represents the most important point for physicians to pay attention to. Both loose stools and constipation belong to this condition. Someone asks, "What causes the difference between loose stools and constipation?" The answer is: "When intestinal folds are paralyzed, there is constipation; when they atrophy, there are loose stools."

Chapter 5: Disease Progressing to Dangerous Territory

When the disease condition progresses to danger, diarrhea becomes frequent with mixed foam, touching anything below the waist causes pain, sometimes the spirit seems normal, sometimes there is delirious raving like madness. There are convulsions and muscle spasms, picking at clothes, stroking the bed, grasping at air and twisting invisible threads. Sometimes patients hate sounds and shy away from light, sometimes eyes cannot see and ears cannot hear. Sometimes there is dizziness preventing lying supine, or conditions like seeing ghosts. Sometimes there is coma with extreme prostration, pulse extremely thin and rapid, vomiting and hiccupping with reflux, sweating and bleeding. Sometimes the tongue coating is scorched and ulcerated, urine has a putrid smell, and stool is corrupt and foul, resembling lotus root mud. Generally, those who present with these symptoms have corrupted blood and putrid flesh, with death approaching within days.

Disease symptoms affecting the five senses result from pathogenic toxin invading the brain, causing nerve paralysis and dysfunction. Symptoms of perspiration leakage, bleeding, and putrefaction result from corruption of blood and flesh.

Postscript
○The master once translated over ten Western medical texts and subsequently authored several volumes of Internal Medicine Principles. We have now extracted the section on nervous epidemics from those works, summarized the essential points, created this booklet, and published it for the world. This section is most closely based on the works of Hufeland and Consbruch. Both books were published in recent times, their theories are most clear and definite, and their techniques extremely refined. However, the original works contain many records of the harmful effects of this disease in military camps, but as the narrative branches out and the matters are of no practical use, we have therefore abbreviated and omitted them. Nevertheless, from the stages of disease transformation to the strategies for therapeutic intervention, nothing relies on speculation—all emerges from complete exposition, so let readers take note.

○The original name is "Zeenieuw-koorts," translated as "nervous fever." This is because the fever that develops is related to the nervous system.

Chapter 18: Malignant Signs

When pathogenic toxins pervade without signs of separation, malignant symptoms will inevitably develop. For instance, muscle spasms and flesh tremors, touching clothes or fidgeting with hands are inherently ominous, but when it reaches the point of twisting threads or moving fingers, the danger is most severe. Also, when Rale sounds are not clear even though the illness has not lasted long, this belongs to ominous signs. Furthermore, when speech is difficult and labored, or when one cannot speak at all, these are signs of great misfortune. All of these occur because pathogenic qi lodges in the brain, compresses the nerves, and eventually causes them to become paralyzed and dysfunctional; the danger of this can be known.

When the disease develops and after four or seven days, there is sudden collapse of vital energy, development of stupor, convulsions, and hydrophobia leading to death, it is like a fire being extinguished. Events occur unexpectedly, and one cannot fail to memorize this.

After the disease has progressed for days, those who tend to vomit are signs of danger to be observed. Also, if hearing is not clear, then it is safe, but if sometimes hearing and sometimes deaf, it is dangerous.

Those who are silently fond of sleep are not good signs. Those who are in coma and snoring are malignant signs. People with constipated and blocked bowel movements often develop these symptoms.

Seki (Shingu Ryōtei) observes that muscle spasms and tremors are signs of pathogenic toxins irritating and invading the nerves. Touching clothes and stroking the bed are signs of losing consciousness. Difficulty distinguishing Rale sounds is paralysis of the fifth cranial nerve pair, and is a sign that it is about to spread to other nerves as well. Stupor, convulsions, and hydrophobia are signs of pathogenic heat severely harming the brain and nerves ○ Hydrophobia

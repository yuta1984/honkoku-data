Some people are misled by the name "fever bark" and erroneously believe that cinchona bark is exclusively a miraculous substance for resolving fever. They do not consider inflammatory swelling fever or epidemic fever, and use it recklessly without doubting that it causes harm. This is merely the fault of not understanding medicinal properties.

It is recorded in books on chemical separation techniques that the substance of cinchona bark is a wonderful combination of four elements: gum, fat, earth, and iron. Indeed, for febrile diseases with solid masses, relaxation, and diluted blood, nothing surpasses its efficacy. However, it naturally differs from volatile and dispersing medicines as much as ice differs from coal. Therefore, it cannot easily be used for inflammatory swelling fever or epidemic fever. Let colleagues not use it recklessly and then blame the cinchona bark for the consequences.

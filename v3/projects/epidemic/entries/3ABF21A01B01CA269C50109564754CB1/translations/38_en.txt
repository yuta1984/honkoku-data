[consciousness] is obstructed and perception naturally ceases. Moreover, responding to opium's strange taste and peculiar odor, [the nerves] abandon the disease and begin to struggle somewhat with opium's flavor. Similarly, when one tastes substances with consciousness-dulling properties like aconite, Sichuan pepper, or toad venom, although the tongue originally has other tastes, one immediately forgets the original taste and perceives that flavor. Opium likewise, with its strange taste, seizes the nervous system's perception for itself and alleviates the sensation of disease. According to Blumenbach's theory, consuming large amounts of opium causes the tongue to swell. Therefore, opium is used for conditions where one cannot overcome natural disease through fighting, and if left as is, would result in self-destruction.

Someone asks: "How is it that substances like henbane, though having little pungent taste, possess consciousness-dulling effects?" I answer: "This is also due to volatile salts that obstruct and block the concentration of neural fluid."

Another asks: "Why do other consciousness-dulling agents not make people sleep like opium does?" I answer: "According to Blumenbach's explanation, opium's substance contains abundant volatile and gaseous oil-salts, so when consumed, it immediately rises to the brain and quickly induces sleep in the person. Therefore, when used externally, it has no sleep-inducing or consciousness-dulling effect."

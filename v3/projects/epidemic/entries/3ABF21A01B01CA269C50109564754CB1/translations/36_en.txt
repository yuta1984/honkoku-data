Aromatic penetrating and volatile medicines, though sharp in qi and flavor, when used alone have isolated momentum and weak power, insufficient to achieve success. One should select similar types and gather flavors to obtain the benefits of adjuvant and messenger [medicines]. Those that are fragrant and mild like valerian root are indeed the best examples.

According to my [Shaku's] understanding, compounding is like preparing seasoned dishes - the method is to harmonize the five flavors. Even if there are delicious tastes, a single flavor alone is insufficient to please the palate. However, this does not mean one can randomly combine several ingredients. The principle is to apply careful attention to seasoning like salt and plum. If the seasoning does not achieve proper balance, even exhausting all the delicacies of mountains and seas would be inferior to a single morsel of properly seasoned food. Therefore, the Chinese also have the theory of sovereign, minister, adjuvant, and messenger in prescriptions, and its origin is not accidental.

Chapter 26: The Qi, Flavor, and Efficacy of Opium

Opium has a penetrating, stimulating, and volatile nature. It preserves the spirit, strengthens the blood vessels, and makes people intoxicated and sleepy, but its power is not like the movement of blood by alcoholic qi. Therefore, when there is conflict between righteous and pathogenic [qi], those who cannot overcome the pathogenic [qi] temporarily borrow this to calm and nourish the original qi, hoping for the effect of renewed effort. Although it has the nature of volatilization and dispersion, its effect is not in expelling pathogenic [qi].

Opium's qi and flavor are swift, bitter, intense, and poisonous. It is suitable to administer light doses continuously. If one exceeds the proper amount at one time, it merely strikes the original qi and strengthens the disease momentum. However, when encountering severe symptoms, light doses are also ineffective.

Chapter 3: Epidemic Patterns
This epidemic occurs in all four seasons, but is particularly frequent during autumn and winter. The symptoms initially often present with diarrhea, but cases occurring in late winter to early spring do not necessarily follow this pattern.

The translator Seki notes that worldly physicians call this "summer epidemic" or "epidemic dysentery," with symptoms so acute that patients die within four to five days of onset, often epidemic around the beginning of autumn. Among such diseases, some belong to this epidemic. This is added here for scholars' reference.

Chapter 4: Initial Symptoms
Initially, there is always first chills, followed by fever, rapid pulse, red eyes, dry mouth, and pain in the limbs. The condition resembles catching cold, but with confused consciousness, severe headache like splitting, diarrhea and fatigue, with a momentum as if unable to overcome the pathogenic influence. This represents malignant pathogenic qi lurking internally, preparing to erupt greatly after some days. These symptoms are clearly different from ordinary superficial common colds.

Some have muscle spasms and flesh tremors during sleep, some have belching and nausea, some vomit sticky foam and yellow fluid, some have unclear vision, some have eyes blazing like fire, some have diarrhea accompanied by abdominal pain. Other variant symptoms appear in hundreds of forms, too numerous to list.

From the initial onset, for eight to fourteen days, there is pure fever day and night, the pathogenic qi transmits to the intestinal folds, diarrhea does not stop, and patients readily enter dangerous territory. The treatment method should urgently rescue them; otherwise the intestinal folds become weak and atrophic, loose stools cause loss of body fluids, or constipation accumulates heat, blood becomes increasingly depleted, flesh increasingly wasted, and even with skilled physicians, the condition becomes beyond救 rescue.

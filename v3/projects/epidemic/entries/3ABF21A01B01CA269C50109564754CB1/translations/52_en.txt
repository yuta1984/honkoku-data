All such cases are exactly like this. At this point, the physician's administration of medicine is just like fanning a fire that is about to go out. If you fan too vigorously, the fire will be extinguished; if too gently, the effect will not reach it. Achieving complete efficacy is also difficult. I believe this condition easily develops tolerance to medicines - those who respond in the morning may find the same medicine ineffective when used in the evening, and in severe cases, the gastric organs become debilitated and oral medications have absolutely no effect. However, when facing this situation, medical techniques are not necessarily exhausted. One should separately employ methods such as external applications, enemas, medicinal baths, and the like, which have quite remarkable special effects. This is what is called the strategy of taking a castle through surprise attack when a frontal assault cannot gain victory.

Even when applying appropriate treatment to this condition, the fever becomes more intense daily while the spirit weakens daily, and danger cannot be avoided for twenty to thirty days. For physicians treating during this period, the dosage of medicines is extremely difficult. If even slightly excessive, it will conversely cause depletion of the spirit; if insufficient, there is no effect. It is not like other febrile diseases where fever quickly subsides when medicines are appropriately applied. In severe cases, pure fever does not resolve for fifty to sixty days, and there is a tendency to develop malignant symptoms at any moment. This condition often progresses to gastric and intestinal paralysis where internal medicines have absolutely no effect. Some patients may be constipated for several days, and even when purgatives are used, bowel movements do not occur easily, making this sign quite evident. Therefore, treatment should be administered from the exterior. Those who do not understand the principles of human bodily mechanisms only believe that external medicines are indirect and ineffective for internal conditions. According to Leeuwenhoek's theory, when medicinal solutions are injected into blood vessels, they reach their target rapidly, with effects ten times greater than oral administration.

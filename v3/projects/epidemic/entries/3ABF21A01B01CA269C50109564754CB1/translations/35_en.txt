...cannot achieve success, immediately causing symptoms of depression and dysfunction. This cannot but be a warning. However, those substances that are volatile in nature yet pure in qi and flavor can well fulfill their efficacy. Therefore, they are widely adopted and used together, but there must be proper measure in lightness and heaviness, and proper balance in application. Even when medicine is appropriate, overuse brings disaster, while insufficiency renders it as good as ineffective.

Chapter 24: Volatile Medicines

The reason for selecting aromatic penetrating and volatile medicines is no other than this: their function lies in dispersion and volatilization. Therefore, we value those whose medicinal qi ascends to the brain and are persistent, difficult to dissipate. These include camphor, musk, opium, cinnamon bark (kaneel), ether, alcohol, oil, grape wine, snakeroot, patrinia, and schisandra chinensis. Among these, grape wine is most effective.

Those that are volatile in nature with intense qi and flavor penetrate strongly but their qi and flavor dissipate easily. That is, those intoxicated by distilled spirits develop qi rapidly, and although they cannot withstand the intoxication momentarily, they also sober up quickly. Therefore, they benefit this disease little. With pure grape wine, the intoxicated person does not even perceive their own intoxication and sobriety. This is because there are gradual and rapid differences in how the qi affects the nerves. It is like the difference between awakening someone from sleep by tickling versus pinching - this is the physician's purpose when selecting prescriptions in treating diseases.

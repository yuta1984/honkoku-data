disappears. All of these are ominous signs. Also, when urine is like clear water, it is a sign that convulsions and spasms are about to occur, and nothing is more ominous than this. ○ Generally, the method of examining urine is to put it in a glass vessel and let it sit; after time passes, one can clearly know its condition.

In those whose disease moves toward recovery, the urine gradually clears, sediment gradually decreases, the color resembles citrus juice, and the sediment dissolves without coagulating. Those whose urine does not change after days pass show a good prognosis.

When a film forms on the urine surface, appearing like needle points, not dissolving for a long time and becoming turbid and cloud-like, this is dangerous. Also, when clear urine resembles Rhine wine 《name of wine from that country》 and sediment appears like mixed fine scattered threads, this belongs to signs of death. Generally, such people develop convulsions and die. Using this to judge life and death, not even one in ten will be wrong.

Seki (Shingu Ryōtei) observes that urine sediment is important for diagnosing the separation of pathogenic toxins and should not be despised. Therefore, not limited to this fever disease, among all the hundred diseases related to blood, there are none that do not show changes in urine. Generally, sediment like dissolved glue or good pus is a sign of pathogenic toxins maturing and separating, while sediment like needle points, small vesicles, or scattered threads is likely due to loss of the subtle harmony of body fluids causing salt decomposition, or the fibers of coagulated matter spontaneously corrupting and leaking. Nothing is more evident than this for the success or failure of internal conditions. Those who do not understand should not dismiss this as roundabout. ○ Also, in Hufeland's book, citing the theories of Hippocrates and Tissot, sediment like needle points and scattered threads will not disappear unless fourteen days pass. This is the most malignant

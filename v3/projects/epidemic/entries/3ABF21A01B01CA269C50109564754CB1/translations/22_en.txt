Chapter 12: Fatal Symptoms

When perspiration flows profusely, stool has a putrid odor, and the five senses lose their function, this is due to paralysis of the nerves causing internal organs to atrophy. This indicates that the blood is corrupted, flesh is decaying, and metabolic functions are about to cease. Even skilled physicians can do nothing about this condition. These changes generally occur on the 11th, 14th, or 18th day after the onset of illness.

In cases where the disease is violent, if proper treatment is not obtained, some die within two or three days. The time periods recorded here refer only to cases where skilled physicians have obtained proper treatment methods.

Those with rapid pulses have fundamentally severe illness, and those with irregular, jumping pulses generally belong to the dangerous category. The severity of illness and safety of life necessarily depend on whether the pulse is slow or rapid. If rapid, then dangerous; if slow, then safe. When the rapidity gradually decreases, dangerous symptoms also decrease. Those whose pulse is not rapid need not worry even if they have dangerous symptoms. The pulse originates in the heart - it is the source of vital energy and where blood circulates, and the subtle mechanisms of the entire body emerge from here. Therefore, nothing is more important than the pulse for distinguishing favorable from unfavorable conditions and determining success or failure.

Generally, when the pulse is irregular and jumping, this indicates that the nerves are being pulled, obstructing the mechanism of smooth blood circulation, causing the internal landscape to lose its normal function. ○ Someone asks: why does slow or rapid [pulse] relate purely to the mechanism of safety or danger? The answer is: rapid means

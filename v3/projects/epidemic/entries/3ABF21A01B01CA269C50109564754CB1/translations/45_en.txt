They consolidate and astringe what has become relaxed and deteriorated to the point of ulceration in minute areas, and even dissolved and dispersed fluids are gathered by them to become thick and viscous. Therefore, they are effective for symptoms of non-toxic weakness. However, in cases like this fever, although there is fatigue, since the nervous system is suppressed by pathogenic factors, this is why the harm is not shallow. This is nothing other than the principle of treating the manifestation while abandoning the root. To use an analogy, it is like when the branches and tips of a tree are cut away, the roots become even more solid.

Chapter 41: On How Cinchona Bark and Astringent Agents Cause Harm

Astringent tonifying medicines are harmful in this disease and should not be used. As for cinchona bark (fever bark), its substance is like glue and its taste is astringent. When it enters the stomach it does not transform, using substance to fill what is already substantial, causing pathogenic factors to become even more固 consolidated and heat to become even more excessive. If one forcibly uses it, it is sufficient to invite symptoms such as rapid pulse, diarrhea, fever, fullness and obstruction, collapse and exhaustion - one must be warned against this. Physicians of the world sometimes say that cinchona bark tonifies and resolves heat. They do not examine whether toxins are present or absent, do not discuss whether the heat is from deficiency or excess, bark at shadows and chase phantoms, recognizing it as a miraculous medicine for febrile diseases, carelessly and wrongly applying it - there has never been a case without harm. Now, cinchona bark is effective for people with nervous weakness and blood fluid leakage, but when used now, not only is it without benefit, but it actually invites harm - why is this? It is because this deficiency is not true deficiency, but deficiency caused by pathogenic factors. When the pathogenic factors are removed, the deficiency naturally recovers. This differs from ordinary deficiency-heat conditions, and one should know that the treatment must be different.

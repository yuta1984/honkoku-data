Through worry, hunger, and fatigue, pathogenic toxin is already formed within the body, gradually producing chills and fever, with various symptoms appearing progressively. This is called the ordinary type. The so-called acute onset occurs in young people who, perhaps overconfident in their robust health and fearless of consequences, enter steamy, hot, and contaminated sickrooms, suddenly contract the disease and develop symptoms rapidly, experiencing nausea, vomiting, and chills. Within a short time their lower back weakens, dangerous symptoms arise one after another over several days, fatigue increasingly accumulates, and they nearly enter the realm of death.

Someone asks, "Why does acute onset necessarily occur mostly in young people and rarely in those over forty?" The answer: "Young people have flexible nerves and keen perception, so when pathogenic qi comes to attack them, they quickly respond and mount a vigorous fight against the pathogen. Elderly people have tough, resilient nerves and dull sensation, so unless the pathogen greatly conflicts with them, their nerves do not mount a vigorous fight against the pathogen."

Chapter 8: Chronic Conditions

Late winter to early spring sees the highest occurrence of gradual onset symptoms. These symptoms begin with fatigue and exhaustion of vital energy, or a heavy head with insomnia, tasteless food and drink, yet still not confined to bed. After many days have passed and the disease condition has gradually intensified, there is body pain, mental stupor, shivering chills, burning fever, rapid irregular pulse, turbid urine, muscle spasms and twitching, frequent diarrhea, or hypersensitivity with aversion to sound, shame at light and preference for darkness. Severe cases lose consciousness, and the critical condition is also extreme. Though the onset is gradual, it is not easy to cure.

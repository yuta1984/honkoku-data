What is this? It is when patients become frightened upon seeing water and develop convulsive fits. People with convulsive fits from rabies also have this symptom.

Chapter 19: Favorable Signs

The separation of disease toxins generally occurs after twenty days, with coughing and expectoration of phlegm, spontaneous sweating and perspiration, and turbid urine being considered favorable progression. There are also those who develop rashes, those who develop spots, and those who develop abscesses. This is the pathogenic toxin collapsing and departing through these means, which is called "reverse favorable progression." There are also those with persistent dangerous symptoms who drool from the mouth. Although the toxin ulcerates outward, if it does not extend over days, the treatment cannot easily be expected to succeed. Generally, in symptoms of drooling, if there is no drooling, the pathogenic qi will not depart; if the pathogenic qi does not depart, the disease will not heal, but this does not necessarily belong to ominous signs.

These various symptoms, regardless of the severity of the disease, are signs of natural transformation expelling and separating the disease toxin, so any of these should be known as signs of pathogenic toxin dispersion. However, if it occurs through the smooth route, the transformation proceeds without difficulty and separation occurs; if it occurs through the dangerous route, the transformation encounters difficulty and separation occurs. This is the distinction between favorable and unfavorable progression ○ Generally, toxic diseases are expelled and separated by the subtle mechanism of transformation, so even if the disease is not severe, those without signs of separation are difficult to cure. Therefore, when confronting illness, the presence or absence of separation is where success and failure diverge, and is a matter of utmost importance in examining disease.

Tanaka Shōzaemon declined, saying he had currently returned to his home domain, so Tateishi Yoichi came instead. However, he is not an official permanently stationed here, and having just been newly assigned to the rice warehouse this time, he stated that he was not familiar with the details of certificate transactions and such. Therefore, no examination was conducted at this time.

Regarding the matter of Kaga no Kami's delayed delivery of stored rice, this has happened several times before. When there was a lawsuit last year, it was a matter of summoning Hideshima Mitsugu to handle the situation. Now that there is another lawsuit this time, it shows a negligent understanding of the long-standing directives regarding certificate matters. Moreover, with the officials claiming illness and not appearing, and sending officials who are unfamiliar with such transactions - considering all these circumstances, even if Saburōbei and Matabei are ill, arrangements should be made for them to appear nonetheless. Furthermore, since Tanaka Shōzaemon and Furukawa Moku no Suke have also gone to their home domain, they too should be summoned back quickly, and notification should be given as soon as both return.

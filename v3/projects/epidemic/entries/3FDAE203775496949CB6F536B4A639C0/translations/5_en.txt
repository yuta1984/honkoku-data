It manifests on the body surface due to epidemic pathogenic influences that occur around the time of two complete cycles of the twelve earthly branches (around 24 years). Therefore, smallpox produces pus, but measles does not produce pus. It probably existed in China since ancient times, but it began appearing in written records from the Tang and Song dynasties. People of the Ming dynasty called it "shama," and people of the Qing dynasty called it "shashi." Since it is a disease with strong heat toxin, it appears to be confused with "sha disease." While the year and month when smallpox first spread in Japan are clearly recorded in national history, the ancient occurrences of measles are unknown. Since it develops in conjunction with heavenly epidemics, people of old times must have also suffered from it, but there is no clear evidence. Among the records in national history that describe the occurrence of epidemic pathogens, there should also be measles. Generally, it spreads throughout the entire country every twenty-three, four, or five years. It spread in the Genroku kanoe-hitsuji year [kanoe-hitsuji does not exist], Hōei 5 tsuchinoe-ne year, Kyōhō 15 kanoe-inu year, Hōreki 3 mizunoto-tori year, and An'ei 4-5 hitsuji-saru years. The measles outbreaks of Hōei and Hōreki were extremely severe with many deaths, while the An'ei measles was mild. Even in folk sayings, it is said that "smallpox determines one's appearance, measles determines one's life." Since there are Chinese medical texts that discuss it similarly to smallpox, the treatment of this disease is of great importance. Although it is said to spread every twenty-three, four, or five years since ancient times, among these outbreaks, one time is severe and one time is mild.

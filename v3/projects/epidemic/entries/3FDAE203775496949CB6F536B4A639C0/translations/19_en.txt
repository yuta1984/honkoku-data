Very well. Among adults of today, many suffer from syphilis, or alternatively from gan-sō (scrofulous sores), ben-doku (venereal poison), bone pain, etc. They take medicine and think their illness has been cured, but this disease is deep-rooted and residual toxins remain. When they contract measles, the poison is extremely deep and abnormal symptoms appear. Initially, use San-ō-ka-kyū, and detoxification and poison elimination must not be neglected.

Detoxification Decoction:
Ledebouriella root, mint, schizonepeta, gypsum, cnidium
Platycodon, burdock seed, forsythia, rhubarb, licorice
The above should be decocted in water and taken

When measles attacks internally, this is extremely serious. Add pangolin scales to the surface-releasing formula. When there is obstruction from phlegm and asthma, use terra japonica with natural ginger juice. For decoctions, use ephedra, forsythia, red adzuki beans, pokeweed, rhubarb, apricot kernel, bitter orange, and licorice. During the An'ei period epidemic, unicorn horn was given and immediate effects were often obtained. The treatment methods of that time were effective using the treatment formulas from the "Measles Essentials" sections on "surface penetration," "non-surface penetration," and "early disappearance." Since the treatment methods in the Essentials are good, I will not elaborate here - one should go and read them.

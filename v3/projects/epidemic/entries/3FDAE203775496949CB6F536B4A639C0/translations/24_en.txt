This is a mistake [confusing gypsum with calomel]. Also, the saying that gypsum is bad for measles is merely a folk saying that old women and young wives have heard. This came about because during previous epidemics when the toxic qi was strong, people saw gypsum being used unavoidably in desperate measles cases and mistakenly believed that deaths were caused by the gypsum. It would be helpful for saving lives to explain beforehand to diligent people and patient families that gypsum should be used for measles since it is a heat-toxin disease.

Besides this, when various complications of measles develop, one should examine the severity, cold-heat patterns, and deficiency-excess conditions as described earlier and treat accordingly. Although Yoshimasu Tōdō does not discuss disease causes, it is essential to correctly investigate the causes of all diseases and apply appropriate treatments. Since measles is a disease that manifests on the surface due to fetal toxins and epidemic influences received in the qi aspect, the development of complications also depends on the severity of fetal toxins and whether there is proper or improper surface expression. Just as human hearts are not the same, like their faces, myriad forms of complications will appear. Treatment should be given through so-called flexible response to circumstances.

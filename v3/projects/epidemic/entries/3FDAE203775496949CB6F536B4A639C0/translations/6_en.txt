They spread, and whether severe or mild cases continue depends on the climate of that year. The Ming scholar Sun Wenyin's statement that it is "heat arising from the six bowels" is incorrect. The Qing physician Zhang Luyu says that "accumulated heat in the hand and foot taiyin and yangming meridians becomes measles," but this is not so. If accumulated heat exists in two meridians, then all meridians would have accumulated heat, and the accumulated heat in all meridians should manifest together. It is also said that measles is pathogenic heat, but if it were pathogenic heat, one would not be limited to suffering from it once in a lifetime but would suffer from it many times. Like smallpox, the fact that it occurs once in a lifetime means we should understand that measles is the surface manifestation of a type of fetal toxin due to heavenly epidemics. What is commonly called "three-day measles" is urticaria caused by epidemic pathogens. This is a mild condition that small children and weak elderly people sometimes suffer from. It appears that this is understood to be the same as measles. Measles is a serious disease. There are no solid texts among Japanese and Chinese books, and since it is a disease that spreads every twenty-four or twenty-five years, physicians do not frequently encounter it, so they do not pay attention to treating this disease. Even when treating it, when measles begins to spread, they hastily refer to the scattered, careless theories found at the end of various books or read the "Essentials of Measles" for treatment methods.

When one suffers from smallpox and measles twice, the former is chickenpox and the latter is urticaria. When measles and smallpox epidemics occur, chickenpox and urticaria necessarily spread intermixed with them.

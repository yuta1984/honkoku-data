Add half a bowl and mix well, add the powder of fourteen ingredients and knead into pills the size of red adzuki beans, coating them with cinnabar. When smallpox has not yet appeared, take one pill with thickly decocted licorice soup. Adults should take two pills. When there is fever, grind and mix with fresh ginger juice and take it, wearing thick clothing to induce sweating. However, do not take in large quantities.

Prevention Decoction (Yobōtō)

Buddleja flower 《eight bu》　Black cohosh 《one bu》　Safflower seeds 《ten grains, ground》

Decoct these eight ingredients in water. When taken before smallpox appears, it makes the condition very mild. Heavy cases become light, and light cases do not develop illness.

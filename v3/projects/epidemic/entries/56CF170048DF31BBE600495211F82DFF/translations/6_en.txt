Plum Blossom Smallpox-Preventing Pills (Baiei Kitō-tan)
　Plum flower stamens (7 rin, ground to powder) Cinnabar (finely ground and levigated with water, 1 monme)
　Mix these two ingredients with sugar and take on the night of Setsubun (seasonal division). Smallpox will surely be mild. If used every year, one will not contract smallpox. Alternatively, take plum blossoms in the twelfth month, shade-dry them, powder them, knead with honey into bean-sized pills, and regularly take with sake - this is also said to prevent smallpox.

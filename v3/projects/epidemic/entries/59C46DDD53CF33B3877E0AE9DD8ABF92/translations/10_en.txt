[Title] Post Station
Hachibe and Shirobei hold a troubled consultation
Medicine for fertility, completely troubled at Senju
Even while drinking it, crying "this is now a death inn"
Unbearable, with single-minded thoughts toward Kozukappara
Large portions abandoned, turning back at Shinagawa
Snacking belly, finally sleeping at Itabashi
Genmyo Chapter Twenty-One

[Left]
A thousand doses of medicine and Gonsuke, days passing with farts
A blind man's measles visit, candy as a get-well gift
With a thousand people having measles, Kishimojin is truly troubled
The foot soldier had his measles pass easily and conveniently
White robes and long hair, appearing like proxy pulse-taking
Even the evening hours, seventy-five days have passed
Breaking through the poison-breaking with a three-inch stick
What made a complete profit were the spoon and whisk
There's no way he wouldn't hear the poison-breaking - he's the son

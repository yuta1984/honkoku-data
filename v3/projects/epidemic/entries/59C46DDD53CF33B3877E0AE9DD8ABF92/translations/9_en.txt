Coming down from the mountain pass, the doctor rides in a palanquin
Even if light, the blind musician is fed up with mountain passes
At the poor health management pass, eating power rice cakes
The angular doctor and fishing line, and caterpillars too
The eel shop has become a melancholy house, what a pleasant life
Half a day at the bathhouse, but there's nothing to be done
[Duplicate] Okoshi comes out plenty, smiling nicely, dear resident
[Duplicate] The monk pounds the spent okoshi into rice cake
Overeating and weakening, poor health management
The freeloader makes porridge from thin gruel

Due to the doctor's negligence, the patient's legs gave out
A thousand doses of medicine, and Gonsuke passes days with farts
There's no way he wouldn't hear the poisonous threats - he's the son
The pill, already extinguished, is the spoon and ritual whisk
Wondering if it's contagious, the pharmacy owner goes trembling
Eel scratching causes injury, so scratching the head
Even rhinoceros horn becomes "Namu Amida Butsu," returning the precious horn
Breaking through the poisonous threats with a three-inch stick
Coming down from the mountain pass, the maid goes night-crawling
Placing it in and stabbing, telling them to die

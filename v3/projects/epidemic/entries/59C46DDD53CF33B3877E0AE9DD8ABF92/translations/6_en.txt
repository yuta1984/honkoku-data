Even the brothel madam gets measles - how hopeless!
Gonbei has measles, "gonna sleep, gonna sleep"
Without a maid and with measles, it's light - sleeping in the shape of the character for "fart"

[Title] Measles Theme

[Left page]
By divine providence, it passed lightly under the bridge
With fine rice, the tongue's sound stands out
A parent's compassion - even harsh medicine becomes sweet
A parent's compassion makes the mouth pucker with bitter medicine
Until it becomes obvious, the mother of an only daughter grows thin
The innocent child asks mother if milk is poison
Even journeys hard to undertake - my child reaches the mountain pass
Passing lightly, yet another hardship - only for the parent
While it's not obvious, how pitiful - the Echigo lion dance
Even with gold filling the storehouse, it cannot be helped

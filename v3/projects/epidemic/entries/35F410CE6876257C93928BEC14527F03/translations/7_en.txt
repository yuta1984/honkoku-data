　　General Rules
1. This volume contains secrets that the ancients kept deeply hidden, calling them "to be transmitted to only one person" and "not to be taught even for a thousand pieces of gold," which they would not carelessly teach or bestow upon others. However, for the sake of the people of the world, I reveal everything completely. Since this is not at all for the purpose of profit, I do not consider that people will hate and resent me. One should recall the old story of Ikkyū's medicine for throat paralysis.

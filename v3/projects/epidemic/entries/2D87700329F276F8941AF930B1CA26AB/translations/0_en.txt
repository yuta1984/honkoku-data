Smallpox Vaccination Advisory

Since the smallpox vaccine arrived in Nagasaki in the 2nd year of Kaei (1849), vaccination has been tried annually in Edo, Kyoto, Osaka, and other provinces. It has become clearly evident without doubt that this is an incomparable good method for preventing epidemic smallpox. Therefore, in the spring of the 5th year of Ansei (1858), volunteers gathered together to establish a vaccination center at Kanda Otamagaike, where vaccinations were exclusively administered. However, due to a fire in winter of the same year, with the financial assistance and combined efforts of distinguished individuals, the vaccination center was rebuilt in the spring of the 6th year of Ansei (1859) in Shimoiya Izumibashi-dori, north of the Todo family residence, where vaccinations were administered even more widely. Last winter of the 1st year of Man'en (1860), it became an official government vaccination center. We earnestly wish to cooperate with the benevolent intentions of the authorities so that not a single child in Edo and the surrounding areas will suffer from pockmarks, deformities, or early death.

Generally, while vaccination does not discriminate by age, it is considered best to vaccinate around 100 days after birth. Those who raise children should not forget the timing and come to receive vaccination.

1. This disease can only be prevented from spreading by two methods: prevention and disinfection.

1. Unless the general outline of this disease is explained, laypeople will find it difficult to implement preventive measures, so I shall describe the main points below.

1. Since this disease spreads rapidly, one must not carelessly neglect preventive measures.

1. Since this disease can spread from one person to many others, one should understand that they must not enter places where there are cholera patients.

1. From autumn to winter of Meiji 10 (1877), I examined over three hundred cholera patients in total. During that time, I achieved great effectiveness in preventing cholera through the two methods of prevention and disinfection. Therefore, without hesitation about my poor writing, I have composed this work to inform my fellow countrymen.

1. From summer to autumn, especially during the rainy season and prolonged rains, diarrheal diseases are common, so people of the world should follow these preventive methods and not meet an untimely death.

The Pattern of Epidemic Transmission

Cholera transmission is of a special kind, different from other diseases. If there is one patient with this disease, anyone who approaches that person and receives their toxic vapors will immediately contract cholera, no matter how many people there are. Its speed is like fire burning downwind, spreading in all directions - left and right, front and back - and epidemics occur in all areas where the disease toxin is transported. In the tenth year of Meiji, when our postal ship Shinagawa-maru was returning from China, two or three crew members contracted cholera, and those who landed in Kagoshima became the first beginning

of the outbreak. From there, it spread along the routes taken by returning soldiers, and also spread to Hokkaido through returning garrison farmers. However, unlike other diseases such as smallpox, fever, and malaria, it does not affect everyone in one locality, nor does it arise from atmospheric influences. It is necessarily direct contagion - infection occurs either through the foul air from feces and vomit, or contamination from the odor of corpses. Therefore, undergarments, belly bands, and all clothing and equipment that come near patients become intermediaries for cholera transmission.

For example, if there is a cholera patient here, and the surroundings are well isolated, all disinfection methods are implemented, and all clothing and equipment are incinerated, the disease toxin can be eliminated

descended to become earth, the harmonious spiritual energy became humans, and the stagnant energy of remote places became birds and beasts. Among these, I was formed from the condensation of evil yin energy, and after countless years since the creation of heaven and earth, I finally transformed into a golden-haired, nine-tailed, white-faced fox. Divine transformative powers were naturally endowed in me, and I could fly through the universe reaching every corner, penetrating beyond the three worlds with nothing unknown to me. Since I originally arose from the condensation of evil energy, I could not return to the unity of the Supreme Ultimate, and evil thoughts gradually sprouted and arose - oh, to kill all the people of the world and turn all lands into a demonic realm!

First, in China, during the time of King Zhou of Yin, I killed the daughter of Su Hu, marquis of Ji Province, entered her body in her place, and became Daji, consort of King Zhou. I encouraged evil tyranny, disrupted good government, promoted sycophants, rejected and killed loyal advisors, indulged in the depraved pleasures of wine pools and meat forests, instituted severe punishments like heated bronze pillars and snake pits, imprisoned Duke Xibo Jichang in Youli Prison, killed Empress Jiang by throwing her from the Star-Picking Tower, killed Boyi Kao and made his flesh into minced meat, captured Prince Bigan and cut out his heart, killed countless innocent people, and cut open the bellies of pregnant women - their numbers were beyond counting. Thus I disrupted the world and killed people, trying to fulfill my desires, when Jichang's son Fa became enraged and raised troops to punish crimes on behalf of Heaven and console the people. Heroes like Lü Shang, Lei Zhen, and Yin Jiao assisted him, and all under Heaven responded like an echo, with lords gathering without prior arrangement. The great army of tens of thousands faced no enemy wherever it went, the capital was easily conquered, King Zhou died by fire at Deer Terrace, and I was captured alive by Lei Zhen and received punishment under the executioner's axe. However, my true form secretly escaped and continued to wander in China. But since the virtue of Zhou was newly established and sage rulers and worthy ministers were in harmony, I could not find an opportunity to act, so I flew far away to the Western Heaven and was born as a commoner's daughter at the foot of Mount Huayang, using my beauty to become consort to King Banzu of the Yajie Kingdom.

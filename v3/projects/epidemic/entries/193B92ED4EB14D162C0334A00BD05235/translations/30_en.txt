"I saved you for just such a reason as this. He has now become a formless malignant disease, lurking hidden in the human body kingdom, thinking he has long escaped harm from our kind. However, we have received the reward of heavenly freedom, and our appearances and transformations follow our will, so from now we shall become a miraculous medicine army and enter the human body kingdom to strike down and destroy those evil followers. First, I shall become Enshūgan pills, Yin Jiao shall become Baikōsan powder, Xin Shen shall become Jisōgan pills, Bo Yi Kao shall become Kiryōtō decoction, and Taigongwang shall use his divine powers to constantly accompany you as your shadow, assisting with military strategy. With our combined strength, destroying the syphilis would be easier than taking something from the palm of one's hand. This will be a long-awaited chance to flex our muscles—what splendid entertainment it will be! How we wish the messenger would come quickly!"

Before these words had even finished, white light shone forth from the lower world, and a divine being riding on white clouds came directly before Junchoku and reverently bowed twice, saying:

"I am the guardian deity of the human body kingdom of one called Fukutoku Jizaemon. The master of our country was foolish and was deceived by the syphilis demon, consorting with a shapeshifting beautiful woman. From that time, the entire country was suddenly invaded by the syphilis bandit army, and in the other vassal states as well, all those who consorted with that beautiful woman have been overrun by the syphilis bandits, suffering in anguish for many years now. Though the masters of each country devise strategies for dealing with this, they lack the ability to recognize talent and leave everything to quack doctors, making weak palliative medicines their generals. Therefore, in battles on all fronts, our allies have never once achieved victory, and danger presses upon us morning and evening. I could not bear to watch this, so I joined hearts with the guardian deities of all countries to persuade and encourage the master to welcome you as military strategist and pursue and attack those evil bandits, seeking to restore peace to the nation. Therefore, as the general representative, I have come especially to welcome you. If you would not refuse this labor and enter our country, it would be most fortunate indeed."

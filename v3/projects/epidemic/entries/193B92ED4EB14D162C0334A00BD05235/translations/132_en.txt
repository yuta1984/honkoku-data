The various officials driven by lust are like the branches and leaves of the heart, while the people are like the nerves, blood, flesh, and other physical substances. The rebels are syphilis itself, and the medicinal army represents the remedies. Now, the divine spirits took pity on me for having labored for many years on the treatment of this disease, and informed me through dreams about the condition of the human body, the severity of illness, and the proper use of medicines. Among those Four Heavenly Kings, I have long used Jisogan pills and Kiryoto decoction, but the subtleties of their proper dosage were revealed to me in this dream. Although I had long contemplated the formulations for Enjugan pills and Baikosan powder, I had not yet used them openly. However, judging by the response in the dream, they would surely have the power to revive the dying. Waiting for that night to end, from the next day I began manufacturing these two medicines and gave them to patients as a trial. The effects matched exactly what I had seen in the dream, with mild side effects and rapid efficacy. They were truly miraculous medicines, so Juncho's long-cherished wish was fulfilled.

He rejoiced greatly and, combining them with Jisogan pills and Kiryoto decoction, named them the Four Heavenly Kings of syphilis medicine. Measuring the severity of illness and the patient's constitution, he used these remedies, and not a single person who came under his care failed to be cured. His reputation spread widely, and those seeking treatment and requesting medicine came to his gate in an endless stream. Since this was entirely due to the divine response in his dream, whenever he had leisure time, Juncho took up his brush and recorded in detail the events of his dream, which eventually became five volumes. Originally he had no desire to share it with others, keeping it merely for his own reading pleasure. However, a friend persistently requested to copy it, so he finally agreed and lent it to be transcribed. That person then lent it to others, and it was gradually copied and transmitted, which is how this book came to be widely circulated in the world today.

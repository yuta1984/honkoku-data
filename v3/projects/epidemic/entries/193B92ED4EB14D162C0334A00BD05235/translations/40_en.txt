Where exactly in the human body does this so-called "drug toxicity" remain? I do not yet know where it lodges. What is called "drug toxicity" is actually the medicinal potency. There is no medicine without any toxicity. This toxicity effectively breaks down disease toxicity. What is toxic to the disease should be called medicinal potency when it benefits the human body.

Also, when using strong medicines causes mouth pain and produces foul-smelling saliva, this is because the drug toxicity is expelled through the saliva from the mouth. As the drug toxicity is exhausted, the mouth heals accordingly. If drug toxicity remains, the mouth will not heal either. Syphilis is different in nature from other diseases and is not something that can be easily eliminated. Even if the visible symptoms are temporarily cured, this is merely like grass withering in winter. The disease root remains in the five organs, six viscera, and bone marrow. When the drug toxicity is exhausted, vital energy recovers, the diseased body becomes negligent, and poor health management occurs, the disease will manifest again.

Therefore, whether using Enjūgan, Jisōgan, Baikōsan, or Kiryōtō, if those who have obtained their benefits do not continue long-term treatment to extract the disease root, syphilis will recur.

At that time, they mistakenly name it "drug toxicity" and err in treatment. If drug toxicity truly remained in the body, it should not be limited to syphilis medicines alone. Even in cases where rhubarb (daio) is used, while rhubarb's toxicity remains in the abdomen, there is abdominal pain and diarrhea, but when rhubarb's toxicity is exhausted, both abdominal pain and diarrhea cease. Would rhubarb's toxicity recur later, causing abdominal pain and diarrhea again? Syphilis medicines should be understood by analogy to these cases.

To compare disease toxicity to something tangible, it is like a bad habit that has taken hold in plants and trees. Applying fertilizer is like medicine—without continuing to fertilize until the bad habit is cured, there will be no effect. Even though brave generals like Enjūgan can respond well to disease symptoms and achieve great success, if they are stopped midway and other medicines are used instead, the disease root will not be extracted.

For those with mouth pain, if they do not discard the effective medicine after waiting for the mouth to heal, and use it until the scars turn white or return to their normal color, eight or nine out of ten cases will have their disease roots completely extracted. If by any chance there should be a recurrence, then at that time use that medicine again...

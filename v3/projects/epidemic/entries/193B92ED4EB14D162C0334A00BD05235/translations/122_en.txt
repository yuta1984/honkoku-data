It has become so. "Now it is beyond our power, so the Great King himself should sally forth," they reported. When the Syphilis King heard this, he was greatly alarmed, thinking that surely this time there could be no plan for recovery, but given this situation, the national power would revive again and complete recovery would not be far off.

and do not flee, and even when pills and powders are doubled in dose to attack and strike, there are countries where this has no effect.
What the world's physicians argue is that when the mouth swells and hurts, and saliva comes out, it is because syphilis poison hidden and
lurking in the bone marrow is driven out by mercury preparations and inhalants, with no path to escape from the bones,
and since teeth grow from bones, it emerges through the tooth roots attached to saliva, so they

drinker through drinking sake. Also, it is not true that syphilis bandits will not leave unless the mouth necessarily ulcerates and saliva is vomited.
When the mouth rots and foul saliva is vomited, it is the medicine poison coming out,

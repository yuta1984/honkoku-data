It appeared that [the enemy] had advanced too deeply and fallen into the enemy's trap. In any case, [Ruireki-hare] ordered his soldiers to bring the defeated army into the camp, had the camp gates opened wide, led elite soldiers to wait outside the palisade, and struck down the pursuing medicine soldiers with meteor hammers.

Those who happened to remain behind were harmed by the medicine army.

To say it causes harm is from one's own mouth, and to say that using mercury powder has wonderful effects is also from one's own mouth - such false statements are obvious. I do not seek fame; I have researched for several years and compiled the treatment techniques and medicinal formulas I have mastered, writing them in kana script to create two books: "Trivial Tales of Syphilis" and "Miscellaneous Stories of Syphilis."

Those syphilis bandits possess mysterious techniques - when defeated in battle and unable to prevail, they sometimes hide in hair pores, sometimes hide in bone marrow, waiting for the right time, and when they emerge, they spread throughout the nation as before. They are truly unprecedented rebels. Among the 84,000 followers of this Syphilis King, there are dozens of generals worth a thousand soldiers each.

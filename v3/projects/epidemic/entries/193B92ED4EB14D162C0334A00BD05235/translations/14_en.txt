In these times, ignorant physicians use these [medicines] as they please, so that even common people know of them and think they are nothing but poisons. Is this not extremely lamentable?

If one knows the proper methods of adjusting mercury, quicksilver, etc. and uses them accordingly, no matter how severe the chronic illness or accumulated toxins, they can be cured immediately. Therefore, I consider these substances essential medicines for treating syphilis. In the first place, without using mercury, quicksilver, inhalation medicines, etc. for syphilis, what could be used to treat cases where sarsaparilla is ineffective? When harm occasionally occurs, it is the fault of ignorant doctors, not the fault of the medicines. Moreover, when quack doctors use false words to slander mercury and quicksilver and deceive patients, they obstruct the circulation of miraculous medicines and lose the key points of treatment - their sin is extremely great. Patients should carefully consider this and understand that when mercury, etc. occasionally causes harm, it is entirely the fault of ignorant physicians, and they should not be deceived by the false words of quack doctors.

To announce these principles closely to the people of the world, I compare the compatibility of diseases and medicines to the victory and defeat in war, and explain the proper adjustment of prescriptions. When this book is thoroughly read, one will naturally memorize and understand the proper path of syphilis treatment, avoid the misdiagnoses of ignorant doctors, and not fall into the evil schemes of quack doctors. This is my humble aspiration to save the world.

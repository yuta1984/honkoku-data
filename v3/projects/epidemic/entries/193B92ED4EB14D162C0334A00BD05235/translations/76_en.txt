Not a single remaining soldier was left; they all slipped and fell in the yellow mud, rolling and tumbling down beyond the barrier, their life or death unknown. Daio-botanpi-to took Ketsunetsu's head, pierced it on his spear tip, raised a victory cry, and quietly withdrew. At this time, Enjumaru left the fleeing Ketsunetsu to Daio-botanpi-to, led his own forces toward Mount Into, and attacked upward with battle cries.

From here the two generals combined their forces, searched thoroughly through all roads and provinces, between bone joints and meridians, pursuing and capturing the remaining bandits.

Junchoku led them to an audience with the king and reported in detail the course of the battle and the handling of the strategy. The king rejoiced greatly, saying "This great celebration of national restoration - I must never forget this profound debt even unto death. First I must reward your labors," and opened a great banquet to entertain Junchoku and all the generals.

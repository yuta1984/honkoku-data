All of these primarily use smilax (sankirai). For this reason, I employ the single general Kiryōtō. Since all of these are peerless brave generals, I make them my Four Heavenly Kings and use other medicines as their support.

Generally speaking, to attack and destroy syphilis poison, using these Four Heavenly Kings is sufficient. Other prescriptions should be used as reinforcements when facing critical situations and responding to changes. I also have practical experience in treating syphilis. When the three great generals—Enjūgan, Jisōgan, and Baikōsan—engage in battle, even syphilis bandits that have invaded the five organs, six viscera, and bone marrow scatter and emerge to the surface. Areas with wounds may develop pain for four to five days, produce swelling, and discharge pus. This is because the syphilis bandits are expelled and the flesh rises. As the syphilis bandits flee, the pain subsides, the pus ceases, the wounds heal, and peace is restored.

Also, depending on the constitution, internal syphilis poison, when attacked by Enjūgan, Jisōgan, or Baikōsan, may emerge to the surface, causing fever and rashes, then flee within four to five days. From this we can see that these are warm medicines with strong surface-releasing properties. It is absurd that people like you think of mercury as purely a cold medicine. Medicine depends on its preparation method.

Rice, koji, and water, depending on the preparation method, become sweet sake, vinegar, wine, or distilled spirits. Although these four are made with cold water, when they mature they become hot substances. Would you also classify wine made from cold water and rice as a cold medicine? I classify these three generals—Enjūgan, Jisōgan, and Baikōsan—as warm surface-releasing agents. The martial prowess of these three generals in breaking diseases and expelling syphilis bandits is godlike.

When I observe what contemporary physicians do, for example, with chancres, syphilis sores, bone pain, muscle pain, headaches, wounds on the limbs, chest, back, waist, and abdomen, or pain in the throat, nose, etc., they use various strong medicines to achieve great effects. Once they cure the external manifestations—wounds, swelling, or pain—they think the disease root has been extracted. Even though the syphilis poison has not been completely eliminated, they stop using the medicinal generals that achieved great success and instead use smilax preparations under the pretext of eliminating drug toxicity. This is a grave error.

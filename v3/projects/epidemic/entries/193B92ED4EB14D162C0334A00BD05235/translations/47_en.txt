cannot overcome the wisdom and courage of Kōsan, but there are some who can well defeat Kiryōtō, Gohōtan, Shikintan, Keirokusan, Keijūsen, and others. Even those who can well defeat Jisōgan, Enjūgan, and Baikōsan cannot overcome Kiryōtō, Gohōtan, Shikintan, Keirokusan, Keijūsen, and others. Speaking roughly of their proportions, if one fights with the wisdom and courage of Enjūgan, six or seven out of ten will undoubtedly achieve certain victory. Therefore, the syphilis bandits tremble their tongues in fear at the brave wisdom of Enjūgan. The disease bandits also greatly fear Baikōsan and nasal medicines. If Jisōgan, doroshi, and sukarutera preparations—these three—have equal wisdom and courage, fighting with them will certainly achieve victory in three or four out of ten cases. Therefore, these are also what the bandit forces fear. Kiryōtō, Gohōtan, Shikintan, Keirokusan, and Keijūsen—these five all primarily rely on the abilities of sankirai. Therefore, if the five have equal brave wisdom, fighting with Kiryōtō will

No matter how skilled a physician, none can know which medicine general to deploy against which formation for certain victory. No one in history has discussed this matter. Therefore, I do not borrow many generals but use four generals—Enjūgan, Jisōgan, Baikōsan, and Kiryōtō—gauging the opportunity of the moment and sending whichever I think best to the front lines. If I see that victory cannot be achieved, I stop this and send other generals forward. Seeing whether they win or lose is determined when battle begins and military supply routes, oral gates, gum swelling, slight bad breath, and muscle and bone pain occur.

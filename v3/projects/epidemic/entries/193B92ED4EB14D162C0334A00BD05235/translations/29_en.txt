please," Raishin stroked his beard and said, "Do you still not understand, doctor? The human body kingdom exists nowhere else—it is simply a person's individual body. What the Syphilis King just spoke of concerns the household of one called Fukutoku Jizaemon. Approximately seven countries of human body kingdoms have fallen into that demon's schemes, their countries invaded and tormented for quite some time now.

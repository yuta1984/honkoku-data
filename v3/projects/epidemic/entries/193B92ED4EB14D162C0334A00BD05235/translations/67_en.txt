When they attacked like a violent wind, even the medicine soldiers who had been fleeing until now rallied together and counterattacked, and their momentum attacking from left and right was incomparable to the beginning. The mold army was immediately cut down and began to waver unsteadily. Idoku-nuke-kane became greatly enraged and said, "Even if the enemy has devised a strategy, what does it matter?

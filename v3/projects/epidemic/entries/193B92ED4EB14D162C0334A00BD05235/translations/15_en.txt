1. The format of this work entirely follows novels and military chronicles, so the momentum of battles and the state of victory and defeat, where diseases and medicines attack each other, may become excessive. This is a common technique in playful writings.

1. The vulgar people of this degenerate age do not rejoice unless things are strange and mysterious, so I have borrowed from the "Tale of the Demon Women of the Three Kingdoms" which is still popular among the common people today, adding absurdity upon absurdity, such as the vengeful spirit of an evil fox becoming the Syphilis King, and divine spirits like the Thunder God becoming medicines like Enjyu pills. This is entirely to attract the interest of contemporary people and make them read this book thoroughly, not because I take pride in describing strange things.

1. The assignment of disease bandits and medicine armies to each province follows only the general outline. Do not force adherence to these arrangements.

That is to say, where there is heaven there is earth, where there is yin there is yang, where there is heat there is cold, where there is male there is female. Furthermore, good and evil, wickedness and righteousness - absolutely everything exists in opposition. Among these, medicine and disease are particularly antagonistic and opposing forces, and there is no disease without its corresponding medicine. In ancient times, diseases were few, so medicinal prescriptions were also few. In the latter ages, diseases became numerous, so medicinal prescriptions also became numerous. Indeed, the single condition of syphilis had no such name in antiquity. From the Yuan and Ming periods, there were those who spoke of this condition, but their therapeutic techniques were not detailed. Chen Sicheng of the Ming dynasty first wrote the "Secret Records of Syphilis" and clarified treatment methods.

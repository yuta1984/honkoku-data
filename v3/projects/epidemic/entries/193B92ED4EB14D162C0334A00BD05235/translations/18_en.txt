and bewitched the sovereign, causing him to commit various evil deeds. To destroy Buddhism from this country and kill all the people, I first had lions devour and kill a thousand monks, and also tried to cut off the heads of a hundred kings. Before this, my demonic energy was crushed by King Pumyeong's Buddhist virtue and I fell ill. The physician Giba discovered my true nature through pulse diagnosis, and brought medicinal herbs from Mount Geumbong to make medicine for me, which made my suffering unbearable. Moreover, the three honored ones manifested in the palace, and the Buddha's divine light illuminated and shattered my evil nature, instantly revealing my true form. I barely escaped with my life and fled, but could no longer remain in India.

From there I flew across to Japan, became the daughter of Sakabe no Yukitsuna, a retainer of the Northern Guard of Emperor Horikawa, was summoned to court and received the favor of Emperor Toba, being called Tamamo-no-Mae.

This news quickly reached the capital, and by imperial command Yasuchika again performed subjugation rituals, while Miura and Kazusa no suke were sent as attackers who rushed to Nasuno, surrounded me on all sides and attacked. Though I could fly freely, my supernatural powers were blocked by the subjugation rituals, I was shot down by the arrows of brave warriors, and my lifespan of tens of thousands of years perished in an instant, my corpse exposed on the plain.

However, my evil spirit still remained, attached to a stone in that field, blowing poisonous breath on anyone who approached, taking the lives of countless people and livestock. This too was soon shattered by Geno's Zen staff, and my evil spirit scattered once, but gathered again in the Lingnan region of China. Reflecting deeply, when borrowing a corporeal form with limitations, it will inevitably face complete destruction...

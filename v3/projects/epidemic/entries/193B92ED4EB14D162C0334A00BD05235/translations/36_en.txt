"If we continue to use such methods to defend the castle and merely pass the days in vain, the mold bandits will despise our allies, attack the five organs and six viscera, and gradually cause the entire country to decline until our vitality is exhausted and we can count on our fingers the days until destruction. While the nation's power is still strong, it would be essential to use divine generals like Enjūgan, Jisōgan, Baikōsan, and Kiryōtō for a decisive battle. If any of you have different opinions, please speak them."

From among those seated came the cry: "Unnecessary! Unnecessary! Great King, you must not believe the treacherous words of Kushōjin and recklessly employ violent generals with severe medicinal toxicity. If we must use someone unavoidably, it should be Kiryōtō alone. Although the three - Enjūgan, Baikōsan, and Jisōgan - are brave generals, being cold medicines, they have what is called medicinal toxicity, and after destroying the mold poison, they will instead torment the nation even more than the mold poison itself. I believe that Kushōjin has joined hearts with Junju to use such fierce and evil medicine generals, ostensibly to defeat the mold bandits, but ultimately to seize the nation.

Kushōjin became greatly angered and said: "You flatterers who ingratiate yourselves with the sick nation through clever words and pleasing appearance - for you to open your mouths rashly at this crucial assembly discussing the nation's safety and danger is the height of rudeness! Moreover, to call myself, Teacher Junju, and even the Four Heavenly Kings all companions of rebellion is something I cannot let pass. I would argue this myself, but if I misspeak, it would become a disgrace. Teacher, please make a thorough distinction in my place." He withdrew from his seat, and Junju...

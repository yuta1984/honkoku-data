1. The epidemic disease (cholera) that is currently spreading has extremely sudden symptoms, and those who recover are very rare. Therefore, preventing that malevolent miasma should be the first priority.

Clear water (one cup), high-quality vinegar (one spoonful), sugar (same amount)
Mix the above and drink one small tea bowl's worth every morning before meals. In addition, keep your living quarters clean and occasionally burn juniper berries, salt, and sugar as fumigation. Furthermore, put small amounts of cloves and camphor in your mouth and gargle frequently with cold water - this will prevent contagion of the epidemic disease.

If by any chance one contracts this disease, there is a miraculous medicine newly devised in the West (Holland).
Heat about two gō of sesame oil over fire, apply it to cloth, and avoiding the eyes, quickly and vigorously apply it frequently all over the rest of the body. Of course, at that time, close the doors and shoji screens, burn juniper berries and sugar indoors, dress warmly in layers, and when you sweat, you will surely recover.

The above method is a wonderful technique for helping people, so I wish that everyone would use it and be safe.

Since Oho Gen'go committed discourtesy, the written directive
handed from Nakamizo Magonoemon at Ninomaru to Minoda Sakuzaemon
was as follows:

　　　　　Retainers of Kii-no-kami-dono
　　　　　　　　　Nakajima Sadanoske
　　　　　　　　　Oho Gen'go

On the twenty-seventh day past, during the return journey from the Shiraishi hunt,
when these two men approached from the Minamida road at the western entrance of Ushizu,
the advance sweepers and other attendants
repeatedly informed them of the protocol to yield way,
but they did not comply and committed discourtesy.
There is no excuse for not knowing the proper conduct during a lord's passage,
and this was extremely negligent. Henceforth, such
incidents should not occur and proper instructions should be given. The above.

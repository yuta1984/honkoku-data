One　The above eight men from the mounted retainers and below submitted a petition stating that due to current circumstances,
　　they cannot continue their duties with their own resources alone, so they requested to borrow
　　even a small amount. Since their petition was deemed
　　unavoidable, they were each granted a loan of 400 mon in coins.

One　Ureshino Jinbei contracted a wind illness and showed
　　no signs of quick recovery, so he requested to resign
　　from his position, which was granted as requested.

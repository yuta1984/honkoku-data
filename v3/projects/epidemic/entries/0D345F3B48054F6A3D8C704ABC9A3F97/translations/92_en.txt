One　His Lordship lodged at Todoroki-gi last night, rested at Kanzaki today,
　　and arrived directly at Ogi around half past the ninth hour of midday.
One　For the messenger to inform Tanshu-sama of the arrival, the intermediary
　　was supposed to go directly from Kanzaki to Saga in the early evening to carry out this duty,
　　but this time with reduced personnel, only one intermediary was sent down, and due to lack of
　　personnel, someone from here was to serve instead, as word had come
　　from the journey earlier, so Tomeshu Hachirozaemon served in this capacity.
　　[One line folded and difficult to decipher]
　　was sent, and after this person's arrival, Hachirozaemon went to Saga to
　　carry out the duty.
One　To the various lords and ladies for notification in Saga, and also
　　to Okiyo-sama, notification was sent from the Western Palace.
One　Upon arrival, His Lordship entered his private quarters, and his meal was
　　taken outside.

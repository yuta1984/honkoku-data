　　　　　　　Preface
Generally speaking, there is no human disease that does not originate from carelessness in health maintenance and prevention—this has already been clearly proven by wise predecessors and requires no further elaboration. Particularly with infectious diseases, the carelessness of just one household or one person can extend to an entire city or village, and in severe cases, eventually spread throughout the entire nation, causing indescribable harm. This is truly something to be feared. While the disease's severity naturally varies in degree, when viewed broadly, the situation is no different from floodwaters overwhelming and washing away villages, or fires spreading and reducing neighborhoods to ashes. Now, to prevent floods there are embankment facilities, and to combat fires there are firefighter preparations. How then can we treat infectious diseases with negligence and leave them unchecked? Having observed one or two infectious diseases that have recently appeared in various places throughout this prefecture, I have compiled simple prevention methods here to be implemented in the future, hoping thereby to prevent the misfortune of premature death among the people.

Methods for Preventing Infectious Diseases

　　　　Precautions for Preventing Typhoid Fever
Typhoid fever (commonly called epidemic disease) is also a fearsome infectious disease like cholera, and while its severity varies according to the nature of the epidemic, every year many people contract this illness and meet untimely deaths. The disease poison originates in animal putrefactive matter (rotted meat, decayed hair, etc.), evaporates into the atmosphere, or penetrates into the ground and mixes with well water and springs.

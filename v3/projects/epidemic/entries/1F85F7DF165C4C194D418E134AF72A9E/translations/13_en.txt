may appear. During fever, one should not judge based on severity. Generally,
food cannot be eaten. Smallpox from beginning to end is fundamentally based on stomach qi.
Even in severe cases, as long as the patient does not completely stop eating (literally "chopsticks do not cease"), this should be considered auspicious and
one should endure through it. Those born with hyperactive liver qi may
stare fixedly during fever, but one should not be alarmed. This will necessarily become calm
afterwards. Those who speak much nonsense and cannot even recognize people are
difficult cases. Also, greatly malignant cases during initial symptoms have heads and faces that appear
red as if burned by fire, as if rouge had been applied. When examined by candlelight, between flesh
and skin, clumps of red matter can be seen in places, unmoving.
When the fever is strong and lips appear purple-black, and especially when no voice can be produced,

making sounds like a wild goose crying, this is greatly malignant pox. However, this cannot be judged categorically.
Vomiting and diarrhea with abdominal pain has two causes: food stagnation with cold qi, and toxin-fire of smallpox.
Among these, diarrhea during initial fever is difficult to stop
quickly. Vomiting is serious because the toxin-fire of smallpox moves upward. In any case, vomiting should be
treated. If diarrhea caused by cold is not stopped, the smallpox lesions will not emerge properly.
When bowel movements cease for several days, some movement should be facilitated. When smallpox toxin-fire
causes abdominal pain, it extends to the lower back. This is necessarily serious. During fever,
sweating indicates harmonized qi and is an extremely good symptom. Bleeding symptoms are bad.
Nosebleeds during fever should be treated. There is no need to worry.

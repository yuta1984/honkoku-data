When they emerge and float uniformly, this is called the "upper barrier," and when they hold pus and begin to dry, this is called the "later barrier." Those that emerge but do not float have difficulty passing the upper barrier of five to six days. The later barrier occurs on the tenth or eleventh day. However, for children under one year of age, they dry early without waiting for the fifteen-day period, so for severe cases of smallpox, the eighth or ninth day should be considered equivalent to the tenth or eleventh day for three- to four-year-olds. It is common knowledge that the entire process takes twelve days, and the ritual of "sending off the gods" should determine the fortune of the smallpox. For good smallpox, no medicine should be used from this point. Also, even if it appears mild, cases that involve other complications should not be left alone, and the guidance of a good physician should be sought.
　　Concerning the judgment of good and bad during the three days of fluid filling (suppuration stage)

First, if scratched and broken during the fluid-filling stage, even good smallpox will change and become bad. When fully emerged with distinct skin areas and raised pustules that fill with fluid, this is a good sign. Greatly auspicious smallpox has coarse pustules with redness appearing around them, and the color of the smallpox shows strong vigor. Smallpox with insufficient qi lacks red borders, appears whitish with the same color as the skin, and has weak vigor. The fever subsides after full emergence, and fever appears during the fluid-filling stage. Good smallpox, even with surface heat, remains cool inside and appetite continues. At this time, if blood heat is strong and the smallpox color becomes bloodshot and loses moisture, the poison should be quickly resolved. Also, those that become blood blisters due to qi deficiency and burst while still bloody are severe smallpox. Water blisters, as they are called,

Regarding warm-damp diseases: From this observation, miasma is precisely the qi of warmth and dampness. Particularly in the mountainous regions of the south, this qi is most severe and violent, hence it is called miasmatic qi.

Regarding "tongue coating like accumulated powder": This is also seen in the various symptoms section of the lower volume.

Regarding Dayuan Decoction: The Yaozhi Tongyi states: "Furthermore, Wu Youke believed that when warm epidemic evil initially invades the membrane source, Dayuan Decoction should be used. In the formula, the three ingredients - areca nut, magnolia bark, and tsaoko - work together to directly reach the pathogen's nest, causing the evil qi to collapse and quickly leave the membrane source," etc. Considering that Youke's foundation was established from malaria theory, this formula also has its embryonic origins in the various decoctions for treating malaria and clearing the spleen. When tested through observation and hearing today, in the capital it is greatly praised as effective, but in places like the Eastern Capital, its use shows little effect. This is likely due to the influence of local qi. However, the membrane source is precisely the position between half-exterior and half-interior, and the resulting disease is actually of the lesser yang, which is what bupleurum governs. Why would one need to seek elsewhere? Cases like the three elimination drinks syndrome also belong to what great bupleurum is suitable for, yet that formula is scattered and mixed, making it seem particularly meaningless. Youke urgently endeavored to establish his theories, hence he created these various formulas while treating bupleurum merely as a treatment for residual heat. Scholars should not be rigidly attached to this.

Regarding "lingering and dragging": Liu Songfeng says, "a state of lingering entanglement and discomfort."

Regarding "toxin easily transmits and transforms": Liu Songfeng says, "transmission refers to the momentum of evil qi circulation; transformation refers to the mechanism of evil qi change."

Regarding "suddenly": Liu Songfeng says, "dou sounds like 'dou' (fight), meaning suddenly." According to Duan Yucai: "Dou means ten sheng. It is borrowed to use as the 'dou' in 'dou ao' because the dou shape is square and straight. The common creation of the character 'dou'" comes from the Shuowen, juan 14, dou character annotation.

Regarding "transmission and change are inconstant" (in the categorical compilation volume 1, the text differs greatly, written as "Theory of Inconstant Transmission and Change").

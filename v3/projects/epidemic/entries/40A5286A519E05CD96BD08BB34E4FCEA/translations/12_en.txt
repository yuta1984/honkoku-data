It is appropriate to promote sweating, but one must not use heat-natured medicines like ephedra (mahuang) and cinnamon twig (guizhi). One must use Cinnamon Twig and Ephedra Decoction with added scutellaria (huangqin), gypsum (shigao), anemarrhena (zhimu), and cimicifuga (shengma). Even when there are cinnamon twig and ephedra symptoms in summer months, one must not take scutellaria preparations, as they will instead assist the heat qi and cause jaundice and spotted rashes to appear. Although White Tiger Decoction can be used, it merely treats heat stroke and is a surface-releasing medicine for post-sweating conditions. White Tiger Decoction alone cannot expel exterior pathogens. Moreover, in summer months when yin qi is interior, or when people with qi deficiency suffer from heat diseases, recklessly administering White Tiger Decoction often results in chest binding syndrome, because White Tiger Decoction has a cold nature and is not a medicine for treating cold damage. The same volume 6 states: "Question: Can White Tiger decoction be used for all cases after the summer solstice? White Tiger Decoction treats heat stroke and is merely a surface-releasing medicine for post-sweating conditions."

Regarding "using boiling water to stop boiling": The "Book of Han," volume 56, Biography of Dong Zhongshu states: "It is like using boiling water to stop boiling, or embracing firewood to rescue from fire - it becomes increasingly severe and brings no benefit."

If the pathogen has already entered the stomach: Liu Songfeng said: "The tongue coating is yellow and dry, with abdominal fullness and delirious speech, or constipation."

Regarding yang symptoms with yin pulse: The "Treatise on Cold Damage," Pulse Differentiation Method states: "Generally, those with yin diseases showing yang pulses will live; those with yang diseases showing yin pulses will die."

Regarding internal congestion without sweating (recorded in Leibian volume 3).

Regarding the classical theory of first resolving the exterior before attacking the interior: The "Treatise on Cold Damage," Cold Damage Examples states: "Generally, cold damage diseases are mostly contracted from wind-cold. Initially, the exterior is struck by wind-cold; once it enters the interior, it cannot be dissolved. There are none that should not be dissolved through warming and covering - this is not about symptom treatment. Even when planning to attack it, one should still first resolve the exterior before purging. If the exterior is already resolved but the interior is not dissolved, then this is not [correct]."

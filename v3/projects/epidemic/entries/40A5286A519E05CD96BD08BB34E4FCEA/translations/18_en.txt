Regarding Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction: Zhang Luyu said: "Blood disperses when it encounters acrid and warm [medicines], and congeals when it encounters bitter and cold [medicines]. This formula opens a separate gate for cold dispersal of blood, specifically creating a method for clearing heat and resolving toxins. Everything depends on rhinoceros horn, which promotes circulation in the Yangming [channel] to resolve the stagnation of rehmannia. Still relying on red peony and moutan to move qi downward and disperse blood, these are truly excellent assistants to rhinoceros horn and rehmannia. If there is interior excess, add rhubarb; if there is exterior heat, add scutellaria. When the pulse is slow and the abdomen is not distended, but the patient claims fullness, this indicates no heat. Simply follow the original method, and if it is ineffective, add cinnamon heart. This is the unspoken secret of the Thousand Gold [Prescriptions], which I unconsciously reveal here."

Developing jaundice is a fu-organ disease, not a channel disease. In Liu Fangzhou's edition, the original title additionally contains the two characters "fa huang" (developing jaundice). These ten characters form the heading as the main text, while Liu Songfeng deleted the eight characters from "dan" (jaundice) onward.

Regarding the old theory of developing jaundice: This passage is missing from both Liu's edition and the classified compilation, but there is a separate passage that states: "In my humble opinion, the old theory of developing jaundice includes cases following damp-heat and those following yin-cold. Yin-yang jaundice certainly has its symptoms - how can one say it is false? Damp-heat jaundice is especially common, roughly like fermenting yeast. When drink enters the stomach, stomach qi steams and transforms it into damp-heat, which penetrates human skin and interstices, thus forming jaundice disease. How could dry fire have the principle of developing jaundice? This statement is like a flaw on Wu Jun's white jade."

Yeguang notes: This relates to refuting Wu's theory, but the original text is missing. One should supplement Liu's classified compilation according to Nian's edition. Liu Songfeng said: "Wu Jun originally had no theory of dry fire developing jaundice - why speak of it as a flaw on white jade? Who is the critic here? This is particularly incomprehensible. As for saying there is originally yin jaundice, and also saying dry fire has no principle for developing jaundice, this is indeed sound theory. However, yin jaundice also exists in cold damage diseases and miscellaneous diseases, but not in epidemic diseases. Songfeng did not see..."

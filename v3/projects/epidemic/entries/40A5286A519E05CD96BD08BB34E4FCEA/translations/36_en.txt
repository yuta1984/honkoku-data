Raji Yinghuo《1 Back》　Some say that Raji refers to the two stars Rahu and Ketu. The Comprehensive
　Record of Things states that people greatly fear and avoid the two stars Raji. Examining the astronomical records of various dynasties, there is no record of these
　stars. It is unknown when this theory originated, but since it appears in the Song dynasty work Lihai Lu, this
　theory has ancient origins. The Guangya states that Yinghuo is called the punishment star.
Big Head Plague《1 Back》　According to Shuo Yi, its symptoms manifest on the top of the head, back of the brain, neck, cheeks,
　and eyes, with red swelling and pain, accompanied by fever. The symptoms resemble typhoid fever. Treatment methods are

Toad Plague《1 Back》　According to Shuo Yi, its symptoms include swollen and painful throat, thick and sticky nasal discharge and saliva, and in severe cases
　alternating chills and fever, body pain, stiffness, and constipation. It resembles typhoid fever and is also similar to twisted

　neck plague, but differs in that there is no abdominal distension. Treatment methods include cooling and dispersing, harmonizing and resolving, purging and attacking,
　and toxin elimination, treating according to symptoms will invariably result in recovery. Prescriptions are
　scattered throughout various medical texts in their respective sections, so I will not elaborate. The rapid treatment method involves, in the early stage, placing hands on the patient's both arms,
　from shoulder to neck with great force, pushing the stagnant epidemic qi and bad blood down to the wrists several
　times, then tying the wrists with cord to prevent the bad blood from dispersing, using needles to pierce the Shao-
　shang acupoint and the center of the thin flesh near the nail beds of all ten fingers, squeezing out the bad blood will result in recovery.

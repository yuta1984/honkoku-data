The four characters "horizontal connection membrane source" mentioned in the Needle Classic appear in the Seasonal Dew chapter of the Spiritual Pivot. Examining the Malaria Theory in Basic Questions, those that occur every other day are because evil qi internally presses upon the five organs and creates horizontal membrane connections. The path is distant, the qi is deep, its movement is slow, unable to travel together with defensive qi, and cannot all emerge, therefore it manifests every other day. Wang's commentary states that "membrane source" refers to the source connections of the diaphragmatic membrane.

In the Theory of Pain, when cold qi lodges between the intestines and stomach, below the membrane source, blood cannot disperse and small vessels contract sharply, hence pain occurs. When pressed, blood and qi disperse, so pressing stops the pain. When cold qi lodges in the vessels flanking the spine, deep pressing cannot reach it, so pressing is ineffective. Wang's commentary states that "membrane" refers to the membrane between the diaphragm, "source" refers to the source of the diaphragmatic membrane, and "vessels flanking the spine" should refer to the central governing vessel. Master Keisan has a study on membrane sources recorded in Medical Surplus, which can be consulted.

Long ago there were three people. The Record of Various Things states: Wang Er, Zhang Heng, and Ma Jun once traveled through thick fog. One person remained unharmed, one became ill, and one died. When asked why, the unharmed person said, "I drank alcohol," the sick person had eaten, and the dead person had an empty stomach.

Regarding "labor-lu": Some say that "lu" and "li" (strength) have similar pronunciation, and in later medical texts, "labor-strength" is often written as "labor-lu." Suzuki Juntei said: In Xunzi's chapter on Labor and Humiliation, there is "qu-lu swift strength." The commentary states that "qu" is the same as "gou" (restrain), and "gou-lu" means to restrain and bind oneself. "Gou-lu" also appears in the chapter on the Way of Rulers. Master Xie states that in Huainanzi's chapter on Governing Techniques, there is "courage, strength, eloquence, wisdom, swiftness, urgency, qu-lu." "Qu-lu" probably means laboring the body and suffering the flesh. Yang's interpretation as "gou-lu" is incorrect. Juntei notes that the "lu" in "labor-lu" and the "lu" in "qu-lu" are probably synonymous. In Laozi, "lu-lu" is written as "lu-lu" in one version, which can serve as evidence. If "li" (strength) and "lu" are used in opposition, then those who consider "lu" and "li" interchangeable are probably mistaken. Lu Wentao's Zhongshan

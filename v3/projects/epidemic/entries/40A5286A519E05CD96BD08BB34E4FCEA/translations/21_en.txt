Those who have abdominal pain due to residual heat that has not yet cleared cannot all be discussed as dysentery; one should carefully consider this in combination with pulse signs and symptoms.

Spontaneous Sweating

Three yang meridian modification method: This appears after the Dayuan Drink formula for the initial onset of warm epidemics.
Same principle as administering Chengqi decoction for coordinated heat diarrhea, etc.: Liu Songfeng deleted these eighteen characters, and also moved the twenty-two characters from "if mistakenly recognized" onward to the end of the compilation. Upon examination, the forty characters from "coordinated heat" onward should be moved to appear under the sentence "when the exterior is resolved, sweating stops," and need not necessarily be deleted or changed.

Ginseng Nourishing Decoction: The formula appears in the section on combining supplementation and purging.

Night Sweats

If the evil is severe, etc., it will produce crisis sweating: Liu Songfeng said, "These four sentences are explanatory discourse, not the main focus of this topic."

Assist it with Bupleurum decoction: Xu Dongzhuang said, "Zhongjing's harmonizing resolution only clears and resolves heat evil, while body fluids naturally remain. When yin fluids are already abundant and surge out to the muscle surface, external evil naturally disperses. This nourishes sweat to open the mysterious portals, which is vastly different from opening the mysterious portals to produce sweat."

If sweating has not stopped, add clean ephedra root: In the Ephedra section of the Zhenglei Bencao, Tao Yinju said, "Those produced in Qingzhou, Pengcheng, Rongyang, and Zhongmou are considered superior. They are blue in color with much foam. There are also some in Shu region, but they are not good. When using this, break off and remove the nodes. The nodes stop sweating. First boil for one or two boiling periods, removing the foam on top. The foam makes people agitated. The root also stops sweating. In summer months, it is mixed with powder for use. Common use treats typhoid fever, ranking first for releasing the muscle layer."

greatly full, and still producing chills and fever, then the disease is not eliminated. If the exterior is already resolved but the interior is not dissolved, with great fullness, great excess and hardness, and dry stool, then purging can naturally be performed. Even after four or five days, it will not cause disaster. If purging is inappropriate but one attacks anyway, the interior becomes deficient and heat enters, cooperating with heat to cause diarrhea, agitation, restlessness and countless other transformations - the mild cases will become severely ill, the severe cases will surely die.

Regarding "reaching from interior to exterior": Liu Fangzhou's version lacks the two characters "youzhong" (from middle). The Leibian deletes the three characters "youzhong yi" (from middle to). [Note: In the original disease section, there is text stating "essence qi reaches from interior through the membrane source to the exterior," so the two characters "youzhong" need not be deleted. This refers to the interior phrase, where "middle" refers to the membrane source.]

Floating pulse after purging (recorded in Leibian volume 3)

Pulse floating and slightly rapid, body with slight fever, spirit qi sometimes unclear. The characters "slight" and "sometimes" are key points.

Covering with a cup results in sweating resolution. The "Spiritual Pivot," Chapter on Pathogenic Visitors states: "For those whose disease is newly manifested, covering with a cup and lying down, when sweating emerges, it stops. For chronic cases, drinking three times will stop it."

Regarding floating and rapid pulse after purging: Liu Songfeng says: "This still follows from the two phrases about interior symptoms at the beginning of the chapter, using the distant connection method, not tightly following the preceding sentence."

Zhou: Same as "zhou" (complete cycle).

Liu Songfeng said: "At this time, gypsum should not be used in large amounts because it is after purging. One fears it will make the stomach cold, moreover when there are other diseases with prior deficiency and other deficiency symptoms."

After purging, pulse becomes deep again (recorded in Leibian volume 3)

Pathogenic qi gathers again (Leibian volume 3 writes "pathogenic qi gathers again after purging")

After purging, body conversely develops fever (recorded in Leibian volume 3)

　　Host-guest interaction　《Classified compilation volume 1《24 Back》 writes as "pathogens congealed and fixed in blood vessels forming chronic disease" - twelve characters》
　　　Liu Songfeng said: The original title's three characters "host-guest interaction" are not appropriate, in the discussion the phrase "host-
　　　guest interaction turbidity" should have the two characters "interaction turbidity" read together to be clear, if the character "turbidity" is cut off it doesn't make

　treats chronic malaria, blood depletion, and seminal emission. Using these two flavors as sovereign medicines, treats guest pathogens
　congealed and fixed in blood vessels. Furthermore, use pangolin scales' penetrating nature to assist them, drawing the efficacy of the two shells to work together and
　enter the organ-bowel channels and collaterals to achieve their function, hence the name Three Shells. Cicada molting is
　taken for its good shedding property, silkworm is taken for dispersing micro-accumulations, ground beetle is taken for breaking blood, angelica is
　taken for nourishing and activating blood, licorice is taken for detoxifying. When guest pathogens are in the body, blood must be injured,
　moreover with congealing accumulation and thick pathogenic toxins, using angelica and raw licorice also has great
　insight. Only oyster shell has astringent nature, seems unsuitable for use, etc. White peony has contracting nature, also seems similarly

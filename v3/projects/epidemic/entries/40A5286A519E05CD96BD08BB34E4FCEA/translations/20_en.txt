Combined Discussion of Rash Development and Crisis Sweating

Those who follow crisis sweating can achieve sudden resolution, those who follow rash development should seek gradual recovery: Liu Songfeng said, "There are also cases of crisis sweating that cannot achieve sudden resolution, and cases of rash development that recover completely without waiting for gradual improvement. One cannot make generalizations."

This should be cross-referenced with the rash development section and the section on nine transmissions of epidemics and treatment methods.

Crisis Sweating

Epidemic evil transmitting separately through exterior and interior, etc.; after purging warm epidemics, vexation and thirst decrease, etc.: Liu Songfeng said, "The above two paragraphs have no relation to crisis sweating."

Should purge but failed to purge: Ye Tianshi said, "When evil lingers continuously in the qi aspect, one can hope for crisis sweating. The method of expelling evil should benefit the stomach, making the evil combine with sweat. When heat reaches the interstices and opens them, evil exits through sweat. After resolution, stomach qi becomes empty and deficient, and the skin should remain cold for one day and night. Wait for qi to return, and it will naturally become warm as usual. When crisis sweating resolves the condition, evil retreats and the correct qi becomes deficient, yang leaks out with sweat, therefore the skin gradually becomes cold. This does not necessarily immediately become collapse syndrome. At this time, one should rest peacefully and quietly to nourish the return of yang qi. Attendants must not be alarmed or frequently call out, disturbing the original qi. Simply diagnose the pulse - if it is weak, soft, harmonious and slow, even though the patient lies wearily without speaking, with sweating and cold skin, this is not collapse syndrome. If the pulse is rapid and urgent, with restless agitation and inability to lie down, cold skin and sweating, this constitutes qi collapse syndrome. Furthermore, there are cases where evil is excessive and correct qi deficient, unable to resolve with one crisis, stopping for one or two days, then recovering through another crisis sweating. One must know this."

After crisis sweating, again after purging: Liu Songfeng said, "The character 'again' is questionable."

Those with unstoppable abdominal pain are about to develop dysentery: Liu Songfeng said, "After resolution, there are also cases..."

Coptis Drain Heart Decoction: Also found in the "root and manifestation" section of the lower volume.

The Plain Questions states "Where heat excess prevails, treat with cold and cooling": The Essential Discussion of Ultimate Truth states, "Where heat excess prevails, balance with salty-cold."

Shortcut/Easy path: In Qu Yuan's "Li Sao" (Encountering Sorrow): "Why were Jie and Zhou so prosperous? It was only because they took shortcuts that constrained their steps."

A certain type: Some say this refers to "there being one type of such pattern."

Bowel movements

Heat-coordinated diarrhea: Liu Songfeng said, "Heat-coordinated diarrhea in cold damage is different from this." He also said, "Whenever encountering symptoms of diarrhea in warm epidemics, one should first ask whether the patient's usual bowel movements are regular, in order to administer appropriate treatment."

Two to three days after diarrhea stops: The categorized edition connects to the previous chapter saying, "The original text has a raised heading making it a separate section, but now it is copied continuously."
Liu Songfeng stated: "When diarrhea appears in warm epidemics, the illness is also not light. Generally, those belonging to cold are three parts, those belonging to heat are seven parts, and dampness is only occasionally seen. However, Wu Youke's discussion of heat-coordinated diarrhea in his Treatise on Warm Epidemics discusses only heat patterns - is this not biased? I believe that diarrhea in warm diseases belonging to cold patterns is mild and superficial, and naturally cannot be discussed in the same terms as cold contraction in winter months or direct strike of yin channels."

Heat binding with spillover: Liu Songfeng said: "Heat pathogen binds the stool so it cannot descend, and only foul water can flow down alongside the stool, along with the decoctions and medicines that have been administered. This phrase should be explained in this way."

The original text therefore contains this theory.

The Confusion of Multiple Paths: In the Liezi's "Explaining Symbols" chapter: "Yang Zi's neighbor lost a sheep. He led his group and also requested Yang Zi's servant to pursue it. Yang Zi said, 'Alas, for losing one sheep, why are there so many pursuers?' The neighbor said, 'There are many diverging paths.' When they returned, he asked, 'Did you catch the sheep?' They said, 'We lost it.' He said, 'Why did you lose it?' They said, 'Within the diverging paths, there were yet more divergences. We did not know which way to go, so we returned.'"

Like Ice and Charcoal: The Discourse on Salt and Iron states: "Ice and charcoal cannot share the same vessel; sun and moon cannot shine together."

Evil in the Chest and Diaphragm

Epidemic Evil Lingering in the Chest and Diaphragm: When epidemic evil lingers in the heart and chest, this is a purging syndrome. This character "diaphragm" is the key point. The conditions of "fullness after purging" and "vomiting after purging" can be examined for reference.

Raw Gardenia Seeds: Xu Lingtai said: "Ancient prescriptions all used gardenia raw, so it would cause vomiting immediately upon entering the mouth. Later physicians, when making decoctions, stir-fried gardenia until black, so it no longer caused vomiting, completely losing the intention of using gardenia. However, when taken for vexation syndrome, it still has efficacy. I imagine this is because its nature of clearing the lungs and eliminating vexation remains. In the end, one should follow the ancient method and use it raw for the best effect."

Distinguishing Between Cold Damage and Seasonal Epidemics

You say cold damage and seasonal epidemics have a separation like heaven and earth: From Wu's preface.

When seasonal epidemics develop rashes, the disease declines: Liu Songfeng said: "When warm epidemics develop rashes, there are still cases where the disease does not decline."

When evil does not emerge, the disease does not heal: Liu Songfeng changed "while" to "then."

For example: These two characters manage up to the sixty-six characters of "no longer having the distinction between wind and cold."

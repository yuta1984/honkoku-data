The section on "vomiting after purging" states: "When epidemic pathogen remains in the heart and chest, and stomach opening heat is severe, all cause continuous vomiting. Purging should stop the vomiting." It also says: "When suffering from epidemic, there is distension and fullness below the heart, thirst, fever and vomiting. This is a syndrome that should be purged. After purging, various symptoms reduce by sixty to seventy percent, and vomiting also reduces by half. After purging again, distension is eliminated, heat recedes, and thirst stops.

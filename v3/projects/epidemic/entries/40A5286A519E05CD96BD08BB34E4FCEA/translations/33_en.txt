If one takes cooling medicines, the thirst becomes more severe and the agitation becomes more acute. Those with such disease patterns must urgently take pungent-hot medicines, and they will recover in one or two days. ○ If the yin toxin gradually deepens, the symptoms become heavy and sunken, with reverse cold in the four limbs, abdominal pain becoming more severe, or throat dysfunction, distention and fullness below the heart, hard binding with agitation and thirst, deficiency sweating that doesn't stop, or sometimes zheng voice, fingernails and facial color turning blue-black, and all six pulses deep, fine and rapid, with seven beats per breath or more. Those with such symptoms should quickly apply moxibustion of 300-200 moxa cones at the Qihai or Guanyuan acupoints, with the effectiveness measured by the hands and feet becoming gentle and relaxed. Additionally, one should take Correct Yang Powder, Cinnamon Powder, Return Yang Elixir, Reverse Yin Elixir, Aconitum Powder, and White Atractylodes Powder to penetrate and expel both internally and externally, allowing yang qi to recover and resolve through profuse sweating. ○ If the yin toxin is already deep and the disease momentum is困重, with the six pulses only barely detectable when pressed against the bone and disappearing immediately when pressed, with eight beats per breath or more, or uncountable, then at this stage medicinal attack becomes difficult. One can only use the scallion ironing method at the navel center, or apply 300-500 moxa cones - if the hands and feet do not warm up, it cannot be treated. If the hands and feet do warm up, further administer the aforementioned hot medicines to assist. If the yin qi disperses and yang qi arrives, gradually reduce the hot medicines and regulate the treatment. 《Volume 4》

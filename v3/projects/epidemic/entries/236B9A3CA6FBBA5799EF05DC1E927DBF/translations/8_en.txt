　　　Precautions and nursing care during variolation, and dietary restrictions

1. After variolation, pustules typically begin to appear around the third or fourth day and dry up by the eleventh or twelfth day, though one should know that there may be slight variations in timing from person to person. One should know that even a single pustule emerging is sufficient.

1. Fever usually develops on the eighth or ninth day, though it may sometimes begin from the start. During this period, some may be unable to sleep, some may lose their appetite, some may become irritable, while others may experience nothing at all. Though there are individual differences, these cause no harm.

1. After the scabs fall off, what is called "bovine pox rash" may appear as spots all over the body. Also, those with much poison may develop ulcers resembling moxa blisters that take long to dry. Sometimes these symptoms are visible even during the pustule stage.

　　Those with little poison need not worry about this. One should know that people who develop these symptoms carry poison so strong that they would not survive natural smallpox.

1. Keeping clothing and other items clean is good, but excessive warming is not advisable. Generally, it is best to maintain the same care as in ordinary times.

1. During variolation, going outside should be as usual, and play activities should be allowed as desired.

1. Daily bathing is acceptable. Taking baths causes no harm.

1. Shaving the head is acceptable.

1. Being naked during extreme summer heat is no problem. Water play is also harmless.

1. Even in severe cold, one should not overuse the kotatsu (heated table).

1. One should not wear tsutsusode (tight sleeves, also called teppōsode - gun sleeves).

1. When itchy, breast milk should be applied. Care should be taken not to scratch and peel off the scabs.

Such people know neither human compassion nor gratitude. Moreover, if collecting this material were not beneficial, noble lords would certainly not distribute it to their retainers, nor would physicians practice it.

　　Concurrent infection is not necessarily to be feared

When variolation is performed during a smallpox epidemic, it may occur simultaneously with natural smallpox, so it would be most reassuring to complete the variolation before an epidemic begins. However, if variolation is performed during an epidemic,

some say it will summon natural smallpox and cause concurrent infection, making treatment difficult, and many people fear this and refuse variolation. But there is no basis for such reasoning. After fifteen or sixteen days from variolation, one will never again suffer from natural smallpox, but during those fifteen or sixteen days, natural smallpox may rarely occur—this is the same whether or not one has been variolated beforehand. Since this is the inherent smallpox one carries, it may be either mild or severe. There is nothing to suggest that concurrent infection makes treatment particularly difficult. Variolation texts even state that when concurrent infection occurs, it is usually mild. Therefore, one should know that refusing variolation out of fear during an epidemic is tantamount to waiting for natural smallpox to come—a path that seeks out danger.

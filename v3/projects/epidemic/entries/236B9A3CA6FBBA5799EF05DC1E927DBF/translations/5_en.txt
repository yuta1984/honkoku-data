However, being overly fearful of this and neglecting variolation while waiting for natural smallpox to come is also imprudent. Therefore, this too should be left to the physician.

They especially dislike going to other houses to obtain vaccine material, and moreover, saying the physician's house is far away, they refuse to take the child there.

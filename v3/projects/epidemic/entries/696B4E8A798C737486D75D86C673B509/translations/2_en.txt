Master (Ogata) possesses a generous and magnanimous nature with profound scholarship, and teaches his students earnestly without tiring. Therefore, those who travel a thousand ri carrying their books to become his disciples are so numerous their footsteps connect - he is truly a great master of our scholarly community.

Previously, when the Master came to study in Edo, my grandfather, Master Shinsai, was composing the "Supplement to the Study of Natural Products." Knowing that the Master excelled in learning and was also skilled in mathematics, he entrusted him with the task of proofreading the new system of weights and measures. The Master gladly accepted this commission, consulted numerous texts, worked diligently day and night, and completed the task, which has already been recorded in the Supplement.

This book (General Principles of Pathology) was also something my grandfather had once commissioned, and the Master again inherited his will, and during breaks from his lectures, he invariably worked on it without fail. Among the books the Master has translated throughout his life, those completed and bound number several dozen volumes, yet he has not dared to publish them to present to the world. When this book was completed, he first had it carved and printed, intending to fulfill the aspirations of his predecessors and teachers before proceeding to his other works. His single-minded devotion to not forgetting his teachers' kindness, his loyal sincerity and honesty - how moving this is!

Now, the essence of this book lies in observing the functions and capabilities of the human body's organs and investigating why pathological conditions occur as they do, and in examining the mechanisms of various diseases. All of these return to the single method of empirical observation. For books on pathology to appear in our country, this truly serves as the beginning. Here, the various fields of Western medicine are for the first time complete and organized. Is not this achievement truly great?

That the literary style is precise and the narrative clear is commonly known in the world and need not await my words. Alas, if my grandfather were still alive, how greatly would he applaud and praise this work! In my excitement and remembrance, I respectfully record this joy on his behalf in this manner.

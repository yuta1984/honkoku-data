are produced, syphilis spreads causing growths and bone tumors, and cancerous poison infiltrates creating dangerous and severe cotton-like flesh formations—when irritation and impact are severe, morphogenic force also increases accordingly. However, vital force and responsive force are mutually antagonistic in their operation. Therefore, when vital force weakens and the body becomes emaciated with protruding bones, responsive force becomes excessively hyperactive, the pulse becomes thin and rapid, and sensitivity becomes acute (as seen in consumptive diseases). Thus, in organisms like plants where responsive force is extremely weak, vital force becomes increasingly vigorous.

In the human body, if even one limb segment is severed, it is difficult to regenerate it. However, among insects, there are those that, even when cut into two parts, can regenerate head and tail and remain active. As for plants, even when their trunk is cut down, they produce new shoots and flourish again. This also demonstrates the opposition between vital force and responsive force.

Responsive Force (Opwekkbaarheid or Prikkelvatbaarheid)
The eye seeing objects, the ear hearing sounds, the nose smelling odors, the tongue tasting food, the lungs breathing air, the heart circulating blood, the stomach digesting food and drink, the kidneys producing urine—all of these occur because there is something that senses externally and responds internally. What causes this to be so is called responsive force. Unlike vital force and morphogenic force, which are generally possessed by fluids, solids, plants, etc., this force is uniquely endowed in the solid matter of animals and governs all movement. This can also be divided into two forces.

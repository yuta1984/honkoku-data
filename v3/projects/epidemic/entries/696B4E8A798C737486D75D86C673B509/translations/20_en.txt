Its temperature does not increase greatly. This is because vital force suppresses and regulates those thermal elements. Things like electricity also differ from ordinary natural operations in organic bodies—when deficient, they are replenished; when accumulated excessively, they are expelled.

Observing from this perspective, vital force is a mysteriously profound and immeasurable power inherent in organic bodies. Indeed, when present in organic bodies, it transforms lifeless matter and transports it to living domains, operates various organs, brews various fluids, generates activity, and maintains life. Although its wondrous functions are manifold in countless forms, when unified, they ultimately consist of only two types: the mechanism of generation and development, and the function of sensation and movement. Therefore, taking this as the main principle, the subdivision of its details is as follows:

Generally, in organic bodies whose constituent apparatus is simple, the manifestation of vital force is correspondingly minimal. Therefore, things like plants have only the mechanism of development and lack the function of sensation and movement. In the human body, however, the various organs are abundant, meridians penetrate throughout, and it possesses discrimination and wisdom; therefore, the manifestations of vital force are multifarious and virtually limitless.

Formative Force (Plastische Kraft)
Formative force is the power that governs the formation of the physical structure of organic bodies and constantly provides their cultivation and nourishment. Therefore, it also has the name "Restorative Force" (Wiedererfüllungskraft). When divided, this reduces to the following two forces:

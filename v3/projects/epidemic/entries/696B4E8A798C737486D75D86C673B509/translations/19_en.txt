Although the nourishment is generally the same, there are cases where the physical properties and nature differ completely, like the difference between hollyhock and spurge. This is because each organism's vital force transforms its chemical force to make it so. Therefore, if the chemical force in the human body becomes dominant and the vital force cannot control it, the various bodily fluids lose their harmony and dissolve, collapse, and decay; or oxygen and alkali become free in the blood; or earthy substances coagulate to form stones, causing various diseases. Indeed, blood does not decay when inside the body, but immediately decays when it leaves the body. This is because it separates from vital force and follows chemical transformations.

Although the temperature of various inorganic bodies follows the temperature of the atmosphere, this is decidedly not the case with organic bodies. The temperature of human blood is 96 degrees Fahrenheit even during the blazing heat of midsummer. It is also 96 degrees during the severe cold of midwinter. This is unlike inorganic bodies that become scorching hot in summer and freeze solid in severe winter. Even when insects hibernate rigidly as if dead during severe winter, they do not freeze to death because vital force lies dormant within them. This is because thermal force is suppressed by vital force, so heat cannot perform its natural equalizing action. As a test, if you tightly bind the back of the knee with a bandage, blood cannot flow and the foot and leg become cold. At this time, if you place a bag filled with hot sand on it, that part becomes excessively hot. This is because vital force cannot function properly, so thermal elements freely become dominant. If this is then transferred to another part,

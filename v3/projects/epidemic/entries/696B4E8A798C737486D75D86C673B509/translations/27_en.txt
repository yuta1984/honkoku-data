and thus do not communicate with the brain nerves. However, when the so-called vegetative nerves produce extraordinary resistance, they can transcend their domain and reach the brain nerves, causing them to be recognized. For example, when stimulation of the stomach and intestines (by purgatives, parasitic worms, etc.) is strong, pain is perceived.

Brain nerves also transmit their sensations to the brain, but sometimes they generate motor force through the resistance of the brain marrow alone, without waiting for mental involvement. This can be seen in cases such as the opening and closing of the eyelids, the contraction and dilation of pupils, and various diseases involving spasms and convulsions.

Irritability (Prikkelbaareeid)

Irritability is the mechanism by which animal fibers contract in response to external stimuli. This mechanism is particularly observed in muscle fibers, hence it is also called muscle force (Spier Kracht). The movement of all organs throughout the body originates from this mechanism. However, unlike sensory mechanisms, irritability does not transmit sensations to other parts but only produces resistance at the site of stimulation. Yet there are also two types of this: one responds to stimulation from nerve force (nervous motor force) to produce voluntary and involuntary movements; the other responds to stimulation from blood and other substances, independent of nerve force, causing peristaltic motion. These are like the contraction and dilation of the heart and arteries, and the peristaltic function of the stomach and intestines. Indeed, although the muscle fibers of the heart have very fine nervous interconnections, they are constantly subject to stimulation from the blood.

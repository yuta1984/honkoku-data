(of the nerves). Both functions (recognition force and motor force) are sensory mechanisms of the nerves, differing only in the pathways they take.

The mind cannot directly move muscles but necessarily requires the mediation of sensory mechanisms. If one exposes a portion of nerve distributed to a muscle and touches it, one will feel pain in that area (recognition force), and the muscle supplied by that nerve ending will produce involuntary movement (spasms and convulsions) (motor force). Therefore, the movement of all muscles is governed by nerve sensory mechanisms and is not a direct transmission of mental sensation, as should be understood.

However, there are nerves that do not produce conscious recognition even when reaching their main trunk, and that cause involuntary movements at their terminals without relation to mental sensation. These are the nerves distributed to the organs of the chest and abdomen (the so-called vegetative nerves). These nerves are not directly connected to the brain but emerge from nerve ganglia and nerve plexuses to be distributed to various organs. Therefore, even when receiving stimulation, they do not report this to the mind but simply resist it and carry out their own autonomous functions.

The branches of the vagus nerve, sympathetic nerves, and others gather and combine with each other in various parts of the neck, chest, and abdomen to form small nodes, which are called nerve ganglia. Those that interweave to form a network are called nerve plexuses. From these, numerous nerves further branch out and spread to various organs of the chest and abdomen, various apparatus, internal and external muscle membranes, and other parts not involved in consciousness (the intercostal sympathetic nerves form their main trunk). Therefore, these nerves constitute a separate domain with different functions.

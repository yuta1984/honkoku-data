I had hoped to establish standards for posterity. However, since my youth I have devoted myself to Western learning, rushing about east and west, and have had no leisure to study literature. My work is crude and shallow, and I regret this beyond remedy. I thought that rather than having no good fragrance, it would be better to transmit no odor at all, and I was about to cast this manuscript aside, throw it into a box, and leave it unattended for the entire year.

Recently, scholars of aspiration from all quarters have heard of this undertaking of mine, and many reproach me for the delay in its publication. Some request it persistently, like those who hunger and thirst longing for food and drink. At this point, I again considered that the posthumous command should not be delayed, and without regard for its crudeness, I have finally published it and await future scholars.

Kumarajiva wrote in a letter to Huiguan: "The customs of the Tianzhu country greatly value literature. (omitted) But when Sanskrit is changed into Qin language (Chinese), its literary beauty is lost. Although the general meaning is obtained, the literary style is particularly separated, resembling chewed rice given to others. Not only is the taste lost in vain, but it also causes nausea and retching."

From what I have heard, the Sanskrit sutras were translated through conferences of great Confucian scholars of China. Yet even these have such criticism. How much more so my chewed and given rice. People will surely spit it out miles away. How could one avoid nausea? However, even so, if this is given to the hungry, would it not be better than endlessly watching them fill the ditches and valleys? Indeed, would it not be better?

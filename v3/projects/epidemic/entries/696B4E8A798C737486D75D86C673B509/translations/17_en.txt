Vital Force (Lebenskraft. What the Chinese call primordial vital qi, fundamental qi, correct qi, and true qi are all this)

Vital force is the power that governs the life and operations of animals and plants. While the fundamental origin of this substance truly cannot yet be thoroughly investigated and understood, we can only speak of it based on its actions. This is just like how the fundamental origins of attractive force and affinity force also cannot be speculated upon (Note: According to Hartmann (personal name), the origin of vital force is only the tensile and contractive forces that all things possess in common. Therefore, all movements are nothing but the actions of these two forces. Although his argument seems precise and worthy of adoption, there are still aspects that cannot be completely trusted, so we do not adopt it for now).

Organic bodies (animals and plants) are naturally also creations of nature, so there is no question that they possess nature's three forces (mechanical force, chemical force, and dynamic force). However, because vital force exists to govern these, all three forces are transformed and cannot freely exercise nature's ordinary spontaneous properties.

For example, something like blood is naturally a fluid, so it is its natural property to move downward with gravity to low places. However, in the human body, it circulates and flows equally in all directions—up, down, left, and right—without partiality, and does not necessarily collect in the lower body. Even when tightrope walkers invert their bodies, blood does not flow disproportionately to the brain. This is because when the gravity of blood pressure compresses the blood vessels, the vital force of the blood vessels also pulsates vigorously to resist this. However, if the body remains inverted for a long time without rest, gravity gradually gains dominance and vital force cannot control it, so blood finally accumulates excessively in the brain and manifests disease. Therefore, when someone whose vital force has become weak and exhausted after long illness stands and walks for a long time, swelling occurs in the feet and legs.

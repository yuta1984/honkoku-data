and present them in a simplified form. Before long, the master passed away, and by his dying command, Kōsai (Ogata Kōan) inherited his aspirations.

Kōsai then traveled to Nagasaki, where he directly engaged with Dutch visitors, repeatedly questioning them to resolve doubts, took up the original texts again and devoted himself to their study. He also consulted various other books, and through painstaking effort and anxious contemplation, changing his clothes ten times over, he revised his manuscript seven or eight times. This spring he finally completed the compilation and, intending to publish it and transmit it to the world, sent it by mail requesting a preface. I received and read it, and found the literary style fluent and the principles clear - without genuine accumulated learning, extensive scholarship, and skilled expertise, one could not reach such a level.

With the publication of this book, scholars throughout the realm will be able to understand the essence and details of Western medicine, recognizing it as learning that spares no expense or effort in truly saving lives and promoting longevity, and is decidedly not of the type that shows off oddities or competes for novelty. Is not Kōsai's achievement in carrying on his teacher's aspirations, making Master Shinsai live on even in death, truly magnificent?

Kōsai's character is profound and meticulous; he serves his parents with filial devotion and maintains faithful relationships with others. Years ago, he established his practice single-handedly in Osaka, and though not yet forty years old, his medical skills are widely practiced, yet his reputation has not caught up with his actual abilities. Once this work is published, scholars will surely come with provisions and carrying their books, gathering at his gate like ants.

Long ago, when Kagawa Taichū wrote "Kōyo Igen" (Medical Discourse), Gotō Gonzan said to him, "Your school will be busy from now on." I say the same about this work.

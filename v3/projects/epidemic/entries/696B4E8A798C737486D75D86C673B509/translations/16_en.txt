—tricity becomes excessive and still obstructs the cohesive force, so (dynamic action) it temporarily becomes clouds and drifts in the air. At this time, if newly rising water vapor has insufficient electricity and seeks equilibrium, taking away that excess electricity (dynamic action), those clouds immediately coalesce and return to their original form, descending with gravity (mechanical action). This is what raindrops are.

Also, the hydrogen contained in oil has affinity with the oxygen in air (chemical action), but when cold, it is obstructed by the oil's cohesive force (mechanical action) and cannot combine with it. If fire is lit and heat is applied, the cohesive force is thereby diminished (dynamic action), and that hydrogen exercises its affinity force to combine with that oxygen and become water vapor (chemical action). At this time, the caloric and light stored in the oxygen are expelled and also rise together (dynamic action). This is how lamp flames burn.

Also, water's molecular particles attract each other and try to congeal and form shape (mechanical action), but because it contains much caloric, it is expanded by this (dynamic action) and cannot solidify. If the atmosphere becomes extremely cold and takes away that caloric (dynamic action), attractive force and cohesive force assume exclusive authority, mutually attracting and gathering to immediately form shape (mechanical action). This is how water becomes ice (generally, the reason why fluids become solids and solids change to fluids all derives from this).

All other myriad phenomena of nature return to these three actions. Particularly, animals and plants cannot have their transformations fully explained by these three actions alone. This is because vital force exists within them.

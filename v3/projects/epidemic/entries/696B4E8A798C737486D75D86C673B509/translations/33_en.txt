lating substance. These are called "internal stimulating substances" (inwendige prikkels). For example, blood stimulates the heart, lungs, and blood vessels throughout the body; consciousness stimulates nervous force; nervous force stimulates muscular mechanisms; and various secreted fluids stimulate their respective secretory organs.

However, secretory organs secrete their own fluids, and these fluids in turn become stimulating substances for their respective secretory organs. Therefore, bile is produced in the liver and stimulates the liver, the liver resists this and secretes more bile; gastric juice is secreted in the stomach and stimulates the stomach, the stomach resists this and manifests peristaltic function; urine and seminal fluid also each stimulate their respective organs and again promote secretion.

Moreover, in the human body, all organs are interconnected and integrated, their operations mutually respond and become stimulating substances for each other. Therefore, when there is a change in one part, it necessarily extends to other parts. For example, brain disease affects the stomach, and stomach disease affects the brain. This is because the stomach and brain mutually become stimulating substances for each other (this will be explained in detail later). Outside the body, atmosphere, food and drink, light, sound, odor, taste - whether tangible or intangible, all are stimulating substances. These are called "external stimulating substances" (uitwendige prikkels).

Stimulating substances are a general term for those things that cause vital force to fluctuate. Therefore, increasing substances in the body is naturally a stimulus, and removing them is also a stimulus. Thus, the sudden decline of caloric and electrical forces is also a stimulus, and the sudden discharge of various fluids

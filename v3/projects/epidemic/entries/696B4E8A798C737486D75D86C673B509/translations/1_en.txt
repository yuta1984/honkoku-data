Preface to General Principles of Pathology

It has been over one hundred years since Western medicine entered our country. However, in the beginning, all were ignorant and without foundation, not directly inheriting the methods or reading the books, but merely observing what Western doctors practiced, making conjectures and imitating them, possessing only one or two acquired techniques to show off to the world. Later, talented individuals emerged one after another, scholarship greatly expanded, books brought by foreign ships increased, and translated publications appeared in succession competing with each other. Generally speaking, there were virtually no medical books that could not be obtained - it could truly be called prosperous. However, when it comes to the field of pathology, no one capable of advocating for it has yet been seen. This is for no other reason than that the principles are extremely profound and the arguments quite esoteric, and cannot be understood except by those thoroughly versed in scholarship.

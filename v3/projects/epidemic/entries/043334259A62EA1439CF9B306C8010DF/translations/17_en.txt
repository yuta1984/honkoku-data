[Right]
I　Like a wild boar acting bravely and being saved
　　Don't forget the lives lost to cholera the previous year

No　This disease poison that should be expelled, without negligence
　　Clean thoroughly both house and body

O　Oh my! More frightening and terrible than tigers
　　Is cholera disease that doesn't wait even two days

Ku　Diarrhea, vomit and other waste into garbage pits and
　　Throwing into sewers is bad

Ya　The symptoms of the much stronger true cholera
　　Produce purple wrinkles on the skin

[Left]
Ma　Spread occurs because there is poison in diarrhea
　　Everyone gets infected by smelling it

Ke　Sewers should be dredged so they flow properly
　　Stagnation is also poisonous to the body

Fu　Some begin without abdominal pain
　　With plenty of pale yellow diarrhea

Ko　Garbage in waste pits should be removed frequently
　　And preventive medicine should be sprinkled afterward

E　Shrimp, crab, unripe fruit, rice cakes, buckwheat noodles
　　Tempura and such should not be eaten

What we now consider polluted air is air mixed with foul odors evaporating from the unclean sources mentioned in the previous chapter: sewers, garbage dumps, kitchen waste, and toilets. When breathing such air, one immediately falls ill or often contracts epidemic diseases. Therefore, one should dispose of unclean materials as described in the previous chapter and allow fresh air to circulate.

The air in crowded places such as sumo venues, theaters, and variety halls is extremely bad, so one should frequently go outside to breathe fresh air.
Before sunrise and after sunset, one should not pass near ponds, swamps, and other wetlands, as bad air is evaporating from them.
When traveling, one should not depart before dawn.
One should not walk at night on an empty stomach, as this often leads to contracting epidemic diseases.
One should not remain shut up indoors. Windows should be opened frequently to exchange the air.
Particular attention should be paid to sickrooms, otherwise the illness may spread to caregivers.

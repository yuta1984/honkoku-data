　　Chapter Four: On Clothing
While it is natural to wear clothing suited to the season's temperature, in summer one should use white items as much as possible - not only umbrellas, hats, and clothing, but also gloves, shoes, and similar items. This is because white items reflect the sun's light and heat. Particularly, dirt shows well on white items, leading to frequent washing. Wearing dirty clothes is very harmful to health because one re-inhales the waste materials that have evaporated from the body - namely dirt and sweat that have adhered to the clothing.

Undergarments should be made of bleached cotton not only in summer but in all four seasons, and should be changed frequently. The same applies to loincloths.
Indigo-dyed items are primarily toxic to health and should never be used for undergarments.
One should always make a belly band of flannel or mompa fabric about eight sun wide and wear it day and night.
No matter how unbearably hot it becomes, one should not go naked or strip to the skin. To think this is merely about being arrested by police and fined is a great misunderstanding. When it is extremely hot, one should instead wear winter clothes such as woolen cloth or flannel, which will make it more bearable.

　　　　　　See how flowing water does not rot
When people likewise engage in appropriate exercise, they will never fall ill, just as flowing water does not decay. People who do not exercise have pale complexions, are susceptible to heat stroke, and prone to illness. Particularly because they cannot sleep well at night, the next day their bodies are tired and they become unable to perform their work.

People living in comfort or those engaged in sedentary work should exercise gradually after 20 minutes have passed following meals.

　　Chapter Seven: On Sleep
Sleep is nature's best method for recovering from the labor expended during a full day's work and also for nourishing one's mental faculties. Therefore, the times for sleeping and waking should be fixed - normally one should sleep at 10 o'clock at night and rise at 6 o'clock in the morning. When sleeping, one should calm the mind and settle it in the tanden, having no involvement whatsoever with worldly affairs. Even if one sleeps somewhat early at night, one should rise as early as possible in the morning. Conversely, being lazy by staying up late at night and rising late in the morning causes great harm to one's health.

Afternoon naps not only interfere with one's occupation but also cause great harm to one's health.

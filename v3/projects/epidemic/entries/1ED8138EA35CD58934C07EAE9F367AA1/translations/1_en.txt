Susami During Illness
Written by Muro Naokiyo

Long ago, Emperor Wen of Han intended to build a dew terrace and summoned craftsmen to inquire about the cost. When they reported that it would amount to one hundred gold pieces, the emperor said, "One hundred gold pieces represents the wealth of ten middle-class families. I should not spend the wealth of ten families merely to build a terrace," and he canceled even this modest dew terrace project. This deed continues to shine in the historical records to this day and has become a beautiful tale for a thousand years. From the beginning of the current Great Lord's (Shogun's) reign over his realm, he has never indulged in pleasures of song and dance, has not sought any personal luxury, has warned against extravagance in all matters, and has been frugal with wealth for the sake of the realm, comparable to the Han emperors Wen and Jing.

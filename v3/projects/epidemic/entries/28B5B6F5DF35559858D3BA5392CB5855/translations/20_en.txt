Since it is only a matter of a few days, one must be vigilant again and again.

One: Some people put red beans in a bag and tap the skin when smallpox itches, but this is extremely harmful. The tops of the pustules naturally burst or break, and severe smallpox greatly exhausts the spirit. Among these, the face is most to be avoided. If unavoidable, one should lightly stroke with a feather brush or rabbit's paw.

One: Recently, people make the sleeves of undergarments long and bag-like, but when it itches, they rub with those bags, so this is insufficient to prevent scratching and breaking. Simply wrap well with adult clothing so that the hands cannot emerge.

One: In today's world, both doctors and laypeople do not know the efficacy of rhinoceros horn, and many mistakenly believe it is a medicine that brings out the rash. This is a great error. Rhinoceros horn detoxifies smallpox poison and clears blood heat. Therefore, it should be used for symptoms where smallpox is purple-colored, dry and withered, and stools are hard. If used for deficient symptoms where eruption is difficult, it will inevitably damage the spleen and stomach, causing unstoppable diarrhea, inability to eat, internal attack, and death. It is like spending gold and silver to buy disaster. What are doctors thinking when they recommend this?

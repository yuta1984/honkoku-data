But using purgatives too early, using purgatives for deficiency symptoms, using purple pills for heat-toxin symptoms, using ginseng when fever has not subsided, or overusing rhinoceros horn causing diarrhea - these errors will ultimately lead to killing people. Those who are physicians should think deeply about this. The patient's family should also understand this well.

Regarding the matter of being appointed as deputy administrator (daikan) for Niimi-no-sho in Bitchū Province, which is a domain of our temple: Since it is a distant province, I have consulted with Senoo Tarōzaemon-no-jō and have promptly prepared and submitted his written pledge. I shall report the details of this matter to you later. With great reverence, I humbly submit this letter.

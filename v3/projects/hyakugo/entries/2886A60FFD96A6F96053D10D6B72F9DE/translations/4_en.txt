I humbly request and pledge:

Articles regarding the stewardship position (shomu-shiki) of Tōji Temple's estate in Yamashiro Province, East-West Kujō District

Article 1: Having been appointed to this position through the temple's benevolence upon my request, I shall not act with selfish freedom or negligence in any matter.

Article 2: I shall responsibly collect and submit to the temple the annual rice tax (nengu) and public duties money (kuji-sen) without delay beyond the designated time.

Article 3: When developing new rice fields and dry fields through river works (kawanari) and land reclamation (shinkai), I shall not conceal even small portions but shall report them and maintain fairness.

Article 4: Even if the annual rice tax is a small amount, it must be delivered to the main storehouse (sō-gokura), and shall never be delivered to private residences.

Article 5: As both deputy administrators (go-daikan), the head administrator (tō-shitsuji) shall conduct the stewardship duties each year.

Article 6: If there is any illegal conduct or negligence, even if dismissed from the stewardship position, I shall complete the settlement of accounts regarding collected taxes, and when various stipends including zassho payments and residences are confiscated, I shall not raise any objections at that time.

Regarding the above articles: Even if violating just one item, I may be immediately dismissed from the stewardship position by official punishment, and at that time I shall raise no objections whatsoever. However, if at that time there are attempts to seek intervention from various powerful families (kenmon), this should be quickly brought to official attention and I should receive punishment. If I violate these terms, I shall suffer the divine punishment of Hachiman Daibosatsu, the guardian deity, and Daishi. Therefore, this pledge document is as stated above.

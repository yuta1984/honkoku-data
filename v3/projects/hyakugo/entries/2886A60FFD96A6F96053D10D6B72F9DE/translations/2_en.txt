Petition Submitted

Regarding the articles of the administrative position (shomu-shiki) of Yamashiro Province Ōkōji, domain of Tōji Temple

Having firmly accepted this appointment, since it has been granted as a favor from the temple, I must not consider acting with selfish freedom or negligence in any matter.

Article 1: The annual tribute money for both seasons (spring and autumn) must be collected responsibly without exceeding the prescribed time and submitted to the temple. Additionally, when developing new rice fields and farmland from river floods, even small amounts must not be concealed but handled fairly and openly.

Article 2: If there is any illegal conduct or negligence, even if I am dismissed from my position, I must settle accounts for the collected amounts, and when residential property equivalent is confiscated, I shall not voice a single word of objection at that time.

Should I violate any of the above articles, even one, I will immediately be dismissed from the administrative position by official judgment. At that time, I must never raise any objection whatsoever.

However, if at that time there should be any intercession with various powerful houses, this must quickly be reported for official judgment, and I must firmly accept the prescribed punishment. If I still commit violations, I will suffer the divine punishment of Hachiman Daibosatsu, the guardian deity of this temple, and of the Great Master.

Therefore, this petition is written as above.

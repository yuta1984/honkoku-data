Regarding the contract for Kawaharajō-no-shō in Yamato Province, which is part of Tōji Temple's estate holdings: Although there are details in the petition for reconsideration, it has been firmly decided through council deliberation that fifteen kan-mon should be submitted, and I have received the official directive (orikamishi) to this effect. Understanding this directive, I will transport five kan-mon during May and ten kan-mon during October each year without fail. Furthermore, regarding extraordinary national duties such as tansen and other levies, none of these shall be paid from the income of this contracted estate. I humbly request that this matter be properly reported to the authorities. I shall comply as instructed. Respectfully and humbly submitted.

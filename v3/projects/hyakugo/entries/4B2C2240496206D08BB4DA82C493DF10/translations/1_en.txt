I hereby petition:
Regarding the administrative office (shōmu) of Aki Province's provincial government (kokufu)

Concerning the aforementioned administrative position, since it has been granted as a favor from the temple, I shall conduct all judgments fairly without personal bias, putting impartiality first every year. Furthermore, the provincial deputy (kokudaikan) shall submit the original document of the petition to Seishun for review, and shall not violate the appointment and dismissal of regular officials. Therefore, I shall diligently submit half of the annual proceeds. Should there be any unlawful conduct or negligence while serving as provincial deputy in this administrative capacity, I shall make compensatory judgment as a regular official. If compensation cannot be made, the temple's granted items may be confiscated at the collection office. At that time, I shall raise no objections whatsoever. Therefore, this petition is as stated above.

　　　4th year of Eiwa, 6th month, 1st day　　　　　　　Seishun (monogram)

I hereby petition and accept responsibility:
　　Regarding the temple rice (jiyo-mai) for Mimura-shō in Ōmi Province, domain of Tōji Temple
For the annual tribute of this estate, I undertake to deliver forty-five kan-mon each year.
Even if there should be drought or flood damage in the locality, or nationwide poor harvests and losses, regardless of what circumstances may arise, I will deliver to the temple without a single sen in arrears. However,
the breakdown of the contract amount shall be twenty kan-mon in the eighth month each year, twelve kan and five hundred mon in the tenth month, and twelve kan and five hundred mon in the eleventh month, which I will deliver in full payment. If
I am even one sen late beyond the agreed dates due to unlawful negligence,
my deputy administrator position may be immediately replaced, and if there are circumstances to be reported at that time,
a lawsuit may be filed with the Kubō-sama and severe punishment imposed.
Therefore, as future evidence, this petition document is thus submitted.

　　　　　　　　　　　Deputy Administrator Kawai Shinzaemon

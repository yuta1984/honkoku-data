Regarding the matter of Terada-koji-sho, concerning the repair fund holdings:

Although we received a comprehensive directive regarding the administrative affairs of all koji-sho south of Hachijo that were donated to us, and concerning the executor's landholdings, we petitioned about our dire financial situation that could lead to complete ruin. Through special consideration, we have been granted preferential exemption as a benevolent stipend for the monk community. Given this favor, and in accordance with the spirit of our repeated petition documents, we shall never again disobey the commands of the monk community.

Should we ever defy the community's orders, please announce to the assembly that we shall submit to judgment regarding these lands.

Respectfully submitted with trepidation.

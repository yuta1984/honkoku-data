Regarding the matter of the deputy administrator position of Ōra-shō, articles have been issued concerning the pledge document submitted by Nakao Yagorō Nyūdō. In accordance with this, I (this humble monk) shall not provide support or advice regarding his deputy administrator position in the future, as this is a minor matter. Furthermore, I shall strictly cease entering and exiting the domains of Yagorō Nyūdō from now on. Additionally, I shall not engage in overnight stays at residences in Rakuchū or Rakugai. Should I violate these stipulations, separate judgment will be rendered. I humbly and respectfully state this.

Kanshō 2nd year (Kanoto-Mi)

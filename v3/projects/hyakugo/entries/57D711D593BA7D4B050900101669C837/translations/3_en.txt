The petition submitted by Toji temple administrator (zassho) Raiken regarding the provincial office of Aki Province is as follows: Although [the lands] have been clearly designated by repeated imperial edicts as construction fund estates for our temple, in recent years, taking advantage of the chaotic times, various military governors (shugo) and local lords (kokujin) have unlawfully seized [these lands] according to their own will, which is improper. The construction projects of our temple are matters that require particularly strict administrative oversight. Furthermore, in accordance with the imperial decree of the 13th day, all disruptive administrative interference should be ceased, provincial affairs should be entrusted to the temple administrator, and collection agents should be dispatched without delay. This directive is transmitted by imperial command.

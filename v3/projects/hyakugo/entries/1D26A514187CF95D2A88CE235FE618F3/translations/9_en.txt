Question: Regarding the sutra text being lectured upon: "Perfect fulfillment of all wisdom, transcendent emptiness, Buddha's original supreme enlightenment and omniscience"
　　In relation to this, can it be said that "all-種-wisdom" applies to both self-realization and the transformation of others?

Question: In the current interpretation, regarding the clarification of the three natures' characteristics, according to our school's doctrine, among the three natures,
　　can it be said that parikalpita (conceptually constructed nature) is a delusory phenomenon, yet without being altered, it directly becomes the stage of enlightenment?

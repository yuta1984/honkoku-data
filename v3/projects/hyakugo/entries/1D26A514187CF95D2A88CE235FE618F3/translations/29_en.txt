Question: Regarding the text "The World-Honored One protects the bodhisattvas who practice the Ten Stages" in the lecture commentary sutra 【uncertain if the character should be right-aligned】
In connection with this, should we say "from the sixteenth volume and from the attainment of perfect enlightenment"?

Question: Regarding "attaining entry to the gate of the letter A" in the current interpretation 《marginal note: text》, in connection with this, can we say that through the practice of one gate, one achieves the fruit of the universal gate?

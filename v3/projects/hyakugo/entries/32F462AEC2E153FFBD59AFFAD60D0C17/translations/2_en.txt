Regarding the position of deputy administrator (daikan) for the Kamikatsura Ueno-no-sho estate in Yamashiro Province, belonging to Toji Temple

Having been appointed to the position of deputy administrator through the temple's benevolence, I shall not act selfishly or negligently in any matter, nor disobey the temple's commands.

Article 1: Annual tax rice, land taxes, straw, rice bran, corvée labor, etc., shall be delivered to the temple without delay beyond the prescribed time.

Article 2: When there are newly developed rice fields, I shall report to the superior officials and receive official inspection.

Article 3: When developing new rice fields and dry fields, I shall clearly report the acreage without concealment and properly handle the corresponding annual taxes.

Article 4: Regarding annual taxes and other obligations, even if one of the two administrators fails in his duties, the other shall make compensation.

Article 5: Annual taxes and official tribute items shall all be delivered to the central storehouse. If even a small amount is stored in private locations, severe punishment shall be imposed.

Article 6: Regarding tax exemptions for crop damage, I shall not process any appeals, even if submitted by village headmen or farmers.

Article 7: As accounting fees, the two administrators shall contribute 500 mon annually, with half (250 mon) allocated for administrative expenses.

Should I violate even one of these articles, my position as deputy administrator shall be immediately terminated without any opportunity for appeal. Furthermore, if dismissed for illegal conduct, any misappropriated tax funds shall be recovered from my descendants for generations. Should I falsely represent these terms, I shall suffer divine punishment from the tutelary deity Hachiman Daibosatsu, the Five Inari Shrines, and the Daishi, Three Treasures, and temple guardian deities. Therefore, this pledge document is submitted as stated above.

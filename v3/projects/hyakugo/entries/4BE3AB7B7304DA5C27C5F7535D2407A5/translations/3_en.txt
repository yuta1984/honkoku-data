shall become the temple's official domain. At that time, no objections whatsoever may be raised.
Regarding the above articles, even if one violates but a single matter, the deputy administrator position shall be immediately revoked.
At that time, no objections whatsoever may be entertained. Should this situation arise and there be interference from powerful noble families or
influential houses, such persons shall be swiftly banished from the temple grounds and shall be subject to severe punishment.
If anyone makes false claims regarding these articles, that person shall suffer divine punishment from
Hachiman Daibosatsu, the guardian deity of this temple, Inari Gosho Daimyōjin, and Daishi Sambō along with the guardian
deities of the temple complex - and it is Jōchin himself who shall bear this consequence. Therefore, I humbly submit this pledge document.

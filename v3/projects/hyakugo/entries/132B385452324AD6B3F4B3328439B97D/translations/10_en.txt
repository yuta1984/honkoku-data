Question: Regarding the sutra text in the lecture "All wisdom is also empty, Buddha's light supreme enlightenment, complete omniscience" [text]
In this context, can we say that complete omniscience encompasses both self-realization and the transformation of others?

Question: In the current interpretation clarifying the characteristics of the three natures, [particularly] according to our school's doctrine, among the three natures, can we say that the delusory dharmas of conceptual construction directly become the enlightened mind without transformation?

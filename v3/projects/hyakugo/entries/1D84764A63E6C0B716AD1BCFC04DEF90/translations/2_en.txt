This time, I believe there will be strict deliberation by each party. Although I personally have reservations about this, for the sake of future precedent, I am firmly resolved to state my position. Regarding matters that do not warrant discussion, should the practitioners report to the temple administration? Also, when receiving collective recommendations and inquiring about the protocol of the warrior houses, what matters should arise? Should there be urgent deliberation? Next, if that object appears, we should seek your opinion in the same manner as the principle of returning empty-handed.

With fear and respect, I humbly submit this.

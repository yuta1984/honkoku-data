Regarding the matter of the offerings to the Fudō Hall from the other day, how has it been decided? If there are still disagreements, should you quickly instruct the public documents and others about that matter of offering taxes in accordance with the regulations from previous years? Although this matter became a serious issue in previous years and underwent official deliberation, has there still been no clear directive? Therefore, it is inappropriate to have such discussions at this late stage near the deadline.

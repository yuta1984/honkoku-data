He entered Shinano Province and stayed at Ojiya and Niigata in Echigo.

Walking on the Beach, Composing with Deep Emotion
In wandering travel, I intend to forget worldly affairs. Yet I cannot help but look up to heaven and feel deeply moved at times. My gaze is cut off by Sado, a single blue dot. Where might Russia be?

Even during a brief walk, the old man did not forget his concerns about foreign affairs.

While Drunk
While drunk, I bid farewell to dwelling places wherever I go. This is naturally the remnant of abandoning the glorious court. In wild abandonment I show no signs of haggardness. I fear that other fishermen might recognize the Three Lu.

(The latter half of this poem refers to Qu Ping of Zhou. Qu Ping, styled Yuan, was a learned and pure person who served King Huai and became Grand Master of the Three Lu, enjoying the king's deep trust for a time. However, he was slandered by colleagues, and when the king died, he was banished by the king's son, King Xiang, to live in the mountains and fields. He wrote essays and memorials of defense, but they were not accepted. At that time he composed what he called "The Fisherman's Words," in which a fisherman (fictional) saw him and asked why someone who had become Grand Master of the Three Lu was now banished with a haggard face and withered appearance. He replied that the world was all muddy while he alone was pure, everyone was drunk while he alone was sober, hence his banishment. The fisherman laughed and said that when the waters of Canglang are clear, one should wash one's cap strings in them, and when muddy, wash one's feet, but Qu Yuan ultimately threw himself into the Miluo River and died.)

The old man too was banished and traveling, but said he showed no signs of haggardness. One can imagine the excellence of applying ancient stories to new situations and his heroic spirit. The old man also visited the grave of Gamō Ujisato at Wakamatsu castle town, returned from the far northeast to Shimotsuke again, climbed Mount Ōhira where Takeda Kōunsai would later make his base, and stayed in Tochigi town for over a month.

Miscellaneous Topics from My Lodging in Tochigi (Part 1)
Throughout life I have loved mountains and waters. How much more so as one wandering in travel? I have not yet been able to explore a single scenic spot. Feeling depressed, I pass three weeks. With idle affairs, the body easily grows lazy. With scattered interests, verses are hard to make fresh. Tomorrow I depart for the castle town. With what can I boast to old friends?

At this time the old man was suddenly summoned to the Edo domain residence. When he returned to Edo, the domain lord told him "due to serious rumors, you will be sent to the home domain," and he was detained in the domain residence as he was, with his wife and children similarly confined.

Banishment now for merely a few months. Water and clouds naturally rejoice in completing tranquil leisure. The urgent summons last night—what matter does it concern? Domain officials detain me and do not permit my return.

Thin quilts covering each other, cold at the fifth watch. Not like the comfort of lying face to face by the hearth. This is most truly a pitiful thing in human life. Wife and children also understand how to endure hardship.

The urgent summons seems to have meaning. Severe reprimand is particularly shocking. How could I not long for hills and valleys? Weary, weary, I lament my life. Prematurely aged, both temples white. Simple learning makes one's person light. No inch of service to repay the country. Holding the sun, I embrace slight sincerity. Could it be other than slanderous brocade? Why are the fabricated charges so elaborate? The rumors are not trivial. Five characters make the crime certain.

All past events can be regretted. Though I regret, what can be done again? Weather has no fixed standard. The human sea has enough wind and waves. Officers and soldiers take turns guarding me. They allow no other person to pass. Factional disasters are the same as in Song times. Imprisoned and confined, I think fondly of Dongpo. Upon reflection, there is nothing I have done wrong. Why need I be stirred to sad songs? "Empty fame invites real disaster"—these famous words cannot be erased.

Every word and phrase flows from his heart and lungs. What the ancients called "seeing the gentleman after not being accepted"—does this speak of the old man at that time?

4. The Great Purge of Boshi (1858)

Considering that the base of loyalist anti-shogunate conspiracies by patriots was in Kyoto, and when the shogunate resolved to eradicate them, Yoshida domain lord Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobutomo, who had deep connections to both the shogunate and Senior Councilor Manabe, had his own considerations and suddenly issued an order to banish the old man from Edo. This occurred on the twenty-first day of the fifth month of Ansei 6 (1859), when the old man was forty-six years old. Even before this, the old man's passionate indignation had reached its peak, and he composed the following poem:

Song of Abandonment
Deep sorrow surpasses weeping. Though I compose songs, they form no proper verses. Looking at flowers and facing the moon, I shed tears. Why ask whether this is feigned madness or true madness? When pain reaches its extreme, it becomes like no pain. When poetry is completed, it becomes bold and unrestrained. Drinking heavily and singing freely, morning after morning. This is real, not a dream, not a dream at all. Alas, a hundred years passes in vain while harboring a thousand years of worry. Poetry scrolls will surely remain long in heaven and earth. I chant to myself, laugh to myself, and weep to myself. Such waiting for a kindred spirit—enough, enough, enough!

Even when news of the old man's banishment was conveyed, it was rare for those who usually associated with him to come and visit. By chance, the Tosa retainer Matsuoka Tokitoshi (styled Yokutotsu, also called Kiken or Yōsetsu, the same age as the old man, who enjoyed the deep trust of domain lord Yamauchi Toyoshige [Yōdō] and, when accompanying him to Edo, would always visit the old man first; after the Restoration he was appointed as a recruited scholar from Tosa) came to visit and said, "Today, is there anyone who would plan for you other than Master Yasui Sokken?" He informed Sokken of the situation. Sokken (named Kō, styled Chūhei, from Nakano village in Kiyotake district of Hyūga Province, initially assistant professor at Obi domain school, later became a Confucian retainer of the shogunate, and served as matchmaker for the old man's wife) first arranged for the old man's wife and children, then considered destinations for the old man's northern journey. The old man left Edo and wandered through various places in Ryōmō, Shinano, and Echigo. In later years he wrote "Northern Journey Remaining Manuscripts," with a preface stating:

"The northern journey of Ansei 6 (1859) truly arose from unavoidable circumstances. I borrowed cup and wine to dispel my melancholy, and poetry also emerged from these diversions. Though I composed not a few works, I did not preserve the manuscripts, and only thirty poems happen to survive."

About to Depart on Northern Journey: Written to Show Koyama Shōkei and Katō Yūkō Who Saw Me Off

Guests seeing me off fill wine casks to the brim. There is no need to discuss fortune and misfortune in human life. I myself will fulfill my lifelong aspiration for mountains and waters. How could I know that this small punishment is actually deep kindness?

Infants lack wisdom and are difficult to explain things to. They ask when I will return from my mountain journey. After the disaster, our new residence's chimney is not yet blackened. Again I take my traveling gear to test the quiet passes.

Yūkō was the adopted son of his brother-in-law Ichisuke. The old man, having become a person in exile, sought to test the difficult barriers ahead. His emotions overflow in his poetry and move people's hearts and souls. Leaving the eastern capital, he first went to Ashikaga in Shimotsuke, where he paid respects to the portrait of his ancestor Ono no Takamura at the historic Ashikaga School:

There is no need to discuss the rise and fall of a thousand ages. I still rejoice that the old foundation of this small school remains. With what face can this drifter pay respects to the ancestral portrait? I am a descendant of the minister, but how many generations removed?

He received a grand welcome from local enthusiasts and daily responded to requests for poetry and calligraphy. Fifty-four people attended the farewell banquet, which was considered unprecedented for a literary gathering in that place. He then passed through Kiryū and Shibukawa in Jōmō, bathed at Kusatsu hot springs, and in the sixth month crossed Shibuya Pass, composing this poem:

Turning my head toward the darkening clouds, I lean against the steep cliffs. One sturdy bamboo stalk lends its strength in support. People should laugh at bold words spoken in dire straits. Standing alone between heaven and earth is also a wonder.

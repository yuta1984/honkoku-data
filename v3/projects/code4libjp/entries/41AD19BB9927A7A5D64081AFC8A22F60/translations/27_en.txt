confinement, restraint, salary reduction, suspension, shackles, expulsion from Edo, non-interference orders, and other crimes, each receiving their respective punishments. However, among those not recorded in history, a great many were executed in Edo.

Prior to this, the old man's close friend Katsuno Yūsaku (whose name was Masamichi, courtesy name Jin'kyō, styled Taizan, and used the alias Nishina Taichirō; he was a retainer of the hatamoto Abe Shirōgorō and an Edo native) visited the old man one day with a plan. Subsequently, Ukai Kōkichi of Mito came and held secret discussions frequently. Yūsaku obtained a letter of introduction from the old man and rushed to Kyoto, and Kōkichi also entered the capital. Soon after, the secret imperial edict was issued to the lord of Mito domain. Of course, there must have been considerably powerful supporters behind the scenes, but the letter of introduction that Yūsaku carried to Kyoto also had its own effectiveness, which was privately recognized among comrades at the time. From his youth, as recorded in previous chapters, the old man had an inseparable relationship with Mito, and if we use today's terminology, Mito domain served as a significant background for the old man's pro-imperial movement in many respects. When the great purge began, Yūsaku concealed his whereabouts and avoided capture. His eldest son Morinosuke was exiled to a remote island, and his second son Yasusaburō was confined. The old man's teacher Seigan contracted a sudden illness three days before the arrests, suffered for two days, and died at seventy. His wife Kōran was once abducted but, being resourceful, argued her case and was released. Many of the old man's close associates—patriots, scholars, and prominent figures—met this misfortune. That the old man was able to avoid cruel punishment and severe calamity was not only due to the protection of domain lord Nobutaka and others as mentioned in previous chapters, but also because the old man always made the restoration of imperial authority his sole objective and deliberately avoided extreme measures, claiming that shallow thinking would instead bring harm to oneself and benefit nothing for the nation. For example, he avoided such actions as killing foreigners, raising righteous armies, or plotting assassinations and poisonings. To avoid unnecessarily deepening the hatred of shogunal officials, he gracefully continued his social interactions of poetry, wine, and refined culture, not refusing anyone. Having considerable acquaintances among both shogunal officials and advocates of opening the country was considered most fortunate and beneficial for his personal safety.

Chapter 5: Confinement in Yoshida Castle

The place within Yoshida Castle where the old man was confined was formerly called Kawage and is now where the shooting range of the 18th Infantry Regiment is located, north of East Eighth District, at the site of the former Yagyū Gate. A mere three-room hovel served as what was called a "sitting room prison," surrounded by a wooden palisade of logs. Several foot soldiers and guards took turns keeping watch, and meetings were permitted only with a small number of domain retainers and those who had obtained permission from superiors. It was no different from an ordinary prison.

"Dignified"
Bearing the dignified body of a man of valor, confined in one room for many weeks already. How can I bear to make my wife and children labor in distant dreams? I am ashamed to leave my younger siblings to care for our loving parent. With no confidants in the world, I compose poetry with regret; my heart harbors deep sorrow and frequently thinks of wine. Yet I seek a place of pleasure within suffering—what kind of men were Dongpo and Taibai?

"New Year's Day of Kōshin"
Joyfully congratulating each other on the peaceful spring. I imagine the fresh sights of the capital gates. My children and wife are truly ill-fated. I know not in what condition they pass this day.

The old man sat calmly in prison, showing no trace of resentment, and devoted himself to reading and composing poetry. When the guards spoke to him about various changes in east and west, he remained silent and did not answer. Everyone was almost impressed by how remarkably composed his attitude was. As days passed and it was increasingly recognized that he had no other intentions, some secretly requested his poetry and calligraphy, studied his literary works, and sent wine and food to comfort him. The superior officers also...

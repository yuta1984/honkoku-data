spiritual beings. They do not even measure up to crows and herons."

"In human life, food is life itself. Without food, there are no people here. How admirable was the government of the ancient kings! Food came before funeral and sacrificial rites. Later generations valued money and goods, viewing food as something light and insignificant. They did not consider it serious to disrupt farming seasons, found no difficulty in abandoning people's fields. Once they encounter crop failure and famine, the starving form confused groups. Rolling up their sleeves they fight each other for food, voices harsh and faces filled with rage. There is no longer neighborhood goodwill - how could they know brotherly affection? How painful that humans, the spiritual lords of all creation, do not even measure up to crows and herons."

Eleventh Illustration: Disease, Suffering, Cold and Hunger Reach Their Extreme

"Hands and feet thin as firewood, face begrimed with dirt like earth. Having illness but getting no medicine, having no home, where can they return? Knocking on doors seeking leftover food, pulling at sleeves to tell of their hardships. Lips parched and mouth dry, what they obtain is truly how much? How could one know that lazy farmers transform into travelers of hunger and cold? Perhaps fearing the aftermath of heavy taxation, father and son lose their place. A single full meal never comes to pass, what use is there in remaining in this world? It seems like hearing the wailing of ghosts, naturally feeling one's spirit become desolate and sad. Do you not see in the marketplace how wine and meat satisfy the cunning merchants?"

The concluding lines are skillful with much satirical meaning. The other poems also effectively depict the sufferings of the common people, truly representing a great policy with literary merit that "the foundation of government lies in nourishing the people." Even in today's Showa era, they have value as moral teachings. When this book was published, Prime Minister Sanjo Sanetomi wrote the title inscription "Regard the People as if They Were Wounded." In Meiji 8, the old man presented this to His Majesty Emperor Meiji. On July 9 of Meiji 16, his son Masahiro, who was then a cabinet secretary, was summoned to the imperial palace and granted an inkstone and one bolt of Kyoto silk. The inkstone was over one shaku long, seven sun wide, with proportionate thickness, a magnificent Duan Creek stone with an inscription by the Qing dynasty person Deng Shiru. The old man composed poetry through tears of gratitude to express thanks for this special favor.

"The purple stone gleams with unusual luster floating, its lingering radiance illuminates and reflects on the old desk. I merely said that worldly glory was thin in my rustic retreat, how could I have anticipated that heavenly grace and favor would be so excellent? The name of 'quiet longevity' was not achieved in a day, the steadfast and firm quality naturally spans a thousand years. From now the world of arts adds a fine tale, this country old man newly establishes the Granted Inkstone Pavilion."

The old man then built a room and called it "Granted Inkstone Pavilion," and also had a seal carved with "Imperially Granted Duan Inkstone" which he used. This grand event was widely celebrated, many people sent congratulatory poems in matching rhyme, and the "Granted Inkstone Pavilion Poetry Collection" was published. The old man's close friend, Privy Council member Fukuba Bisei, sent a waka poem:

"My lord, my lord, your deep sincerity is also revealed,
Today's gift from the sea of inkstones"

Those who received Duan inkstones from the Meiji Emperor included, besides the old man, one other person: Date Munenari, former lord of Iyo Uwajima domain. Munenari was also a famous loyalist, erudite and long-lived, skilled in poetry, and had a deep friendship with the old man.

The old man not only received such special favor, but after moving from Tokyo to Kyoto, returning to Kyoto three times and establishing residence in Sugamo Myogi Hill, in February of Meiji 33, at age eighty-seven, he caught a cold that developed into pneumonia and became seriously ill. He received treatment from Dr. Sato Susumu and recovered after more than ten days, but when news of his critical condition reached the Emperor's ears, on the 25th of the same month he was granted the court rank of Junior Fifth Rank by special imperial decree. Throughout history, poets in our country who received court rank during their lifetime have been rare. The poetry collections the old man published from time to time received the honor of imperial perusal by the Meiji Emperor. He was granted a silver cup due to his longevity, and when the first imperial viewing of sumo took place at Hama Palace, he was specially permitted to attend and composed poetry. He was also frequently permitted to attend other grand events. Many high officials and people of elevated status joined the old man's poetry society and requested revision and critique of their poetry compositions. Imperial Prince Arisugawa Taruhito (Kasumi-do) and Prime Minister Sanjo Sanetomi (Nashi-do) both

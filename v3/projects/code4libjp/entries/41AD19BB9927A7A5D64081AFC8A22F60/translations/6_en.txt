The elder's final work (written 23 days before his death) - a poem composed on New Year's Day

[Poetry scroll]
Seeking refuge from the cold in the East Sea, encountering the spring sun
Suddenly aware that heaven and earth are adorned with auspicious light
For ten thousand ri, water and sky are one golden color
The sun's orb slowly rolls across the Pacific Ocean

At a moment during the New Year of the year of the Metal Dog, at a small hermitage on Cape Taitō in Nansō
The 97-year-old elder Kozan Gen
Died on March 23, Meiji 43 (1910)

(In the collection of Mr. Ono Takezō, Tokyo)

[Poetry scroll]
Who is it that transmits the divine imperial edict so majestically?
With one word, able to establish the foundation for ten thousand years
Pitiful is this old renowned scholar of Kibi
Shamelessly remaining in the same court and being called an imperial teacher

An old work inscribed on a painting of the Usa shrine ritual offering, written at the request of Mr. Fukutani
The 96-year-old aged elder Kozan Gen

(In the collection of Mr. Fukutani Motoji, Toyohashi)

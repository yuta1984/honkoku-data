[He] expressed various opinions. Also, since most of the high officials in the government were from western domains and were not familiar with the circumstances of the Kantō region, they frequently consulted with the old man who was well-versed in these matters. Many people came to know of this and were recommended through the old man's influence, but he also often encountered unexpected opposition. Among the opinions the old man expressed to those in positions of authority were that even the Tokugawa government's policies should be adopted where they had merit and should not be rejected wholesale. He also believed that national educational affairs should not be neglected for even a day, and submitted a proposal to quickly establish a university at Ueno Tōdai, along with many other opinions. However, these were not adopted.

Chapter 7: Filial Care and Retirement

At this time, his mother in Kohoku had already reached the advanced age of eighty. While she was not without joy at her son's advancement and success, she had in fact been chastened by past misfortunes and privately harbored extraordinary anxiety. She frequently claimed illness and persistently urged the old man to return home. The old man had no choice but to decide to return home and requested to resign his position. In February of the second year, he finally received permission and immediately set out on the journey home. Alas, his service lasted merely three months or so. The old man was fifty-six at this time.

Recording Grace on February 12th
How many times I turned my head back leaving the castle gate. Unknowingly dotting my collar with traces of tears. In returning I only hope to plan how to repay this favor. The grace of being allowed to return surpasses the grace of special conscription.

Ōnuma Chinzan wrote in his farewell poem:
To see opportunity and choose retirement is ordinary. To decline honor while successful is unique to this old man alone.

The old man also wrote upon returning home:

Returning Home (First?)
My name was in the court ranks for merely ten weeks. Warblers and flowers, the wind is warm in my hometown spring. My aged parent rejoices at my early return. In conversation and laughter, it's as if she forgets the illness in her body.

There is the sentiment that a loyal retainer is necessarily filial, and a filial child is necessarily loyal. The old man's friend and great scholar Nakamura Keiu (Masanao) later quoted a fragment of the old man's conversation in the preface to "Kozan Kinkō": "The world ultimately regards me as a poet. How can I help it? Such were the master's words. In my view, the master had foundations in learning, was not lacking in teachers and friends, had aspirations in practical governance, and achieved much real effectiveness. I only regret that he did not achieve great employment." In a section of "Toyohashi City Historical Talks" by Mr. Ōguchi Uzan, this passage is quoted, and regarding the old man's resignation, there is a comment to the effect: "That the old man included Keiu's preface in his own poetry collection—can we see this as the old man's agreement with that sentiment?" The author cannot help but sympathize with this observation. Earlier, in verses from a poem where Ōnuma Chinzan congratulated the old man on his appointment:

How could literary composition not benefit the Way? Practical governance achieves success when it meets the right time. Retreating and lying low for years, content like a fine horse in the stable. Soaring today, embarking on the path of the great roc.

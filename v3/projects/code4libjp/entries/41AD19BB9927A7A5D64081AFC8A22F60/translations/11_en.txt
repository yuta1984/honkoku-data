The ruins of the great sage are in the rocky valley, the village path winds deep and remote, entering the ivy-covered hermitage. The three-room thatched cottage still maintains its old structure, the garden pond is partitioned in one section with naturally clear ripples. The way is not far from the traces of Ji and Qi (ancient Chinese sages). The historical records continue the chronicles of Spring and Autumn, with achievements quite numerous. Who would have thought that the master of this dignified sovereign state would also sing the "Caiwei" song at West Mountain.

We have yet to see the western forces announce their triumphant return, rice prices in the city streets are a thousand sen per to. With zither and wine cask, we again pursue our mountain excursion plans. How joyful that we have received such abundance from Heaven.
Composed extemporaneously on the way to Stone Mountain with elderly Eiju, painter Kayō, poet Hōu, and refined friend Shūmu on an autumn day of the Hinoe-Tora year. Master of Kozan-rō

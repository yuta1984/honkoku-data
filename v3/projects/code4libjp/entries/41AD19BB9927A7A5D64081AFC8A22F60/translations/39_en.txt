In Sangu's poetry there is the line "Soft gulls and white herons are all my friends. Dark bamboo and green cypress are truly lovable." Zhou Maoshu of Song called the lotus the gentleman among flowers, but the old man called it "lovable" (kejin). If you remove the crown radical from the character "lotus" (he), it becomes "lovable" (kejin). Both the wordplay and verse construction should be called ingenious. Many poets throughout the capital composed harmonizing verses to these twelve poems, and later the "Lotus Pond Poetry Exchange Collection" was published. When the old man reached his sixty-first year, his kanreki, he composed:

"The year of my birth was kinoe-inu. This year I again meet the spring of kinoe-inu. Though I have grown thus old, there is no need to lament. A hundred-year lifespan still has four decades remaining."

The old man who boasted that a hundred-year lifespan still had four decades remaining actually lived to ninety-seven, so it was no mere boast.

Four Poems on Planting Flowers in the Pond Garden (Number One)
"Wine banners beckoning in the slanting evening light. This life plays with spring blossoms wherever I go. Planting flowers, I plant only in roadside ground. There is no need for scenic beauty to belong to one family alone."

He plants flowers only by the roadside, saying there is no need for scenic beauty to belong to one family alone. One can see the flash of a philanthropic heart that would share pleasure with the multitude.

Six Poems for New Year of Tsuchinoto-u (Number One)
"Sixty with six more added. The present me is not the former me. Poetic sentiment returns to coolness and detachment, spring dreams enter into nothingness. Hanging on the wall are ancestors' brushwork, entrusting to my son pictures of New Year's congratulations. Plum blossoms are truly my friends. Wind and bone are naturally pure and lean."

VIII. Imperial Grant of Court Rank

The old man once responded to a request from Yamanaka Hiroyasu (who took the literary name Koson) and viewed what Yamamoto Kintani had painted called "Illustrated Guide to the Destitute," which deeply moved him. The illustrations comprised twelve panels that skillfully depicted the utterly tragic conditions of people suffering from famine. The subjects were as follows:

(1) Continuous rain makes fields vast as a great lake (2) Wheat kernels transform into butterflies (3) Suffering from drought and praying for rain (4) Strong winds damage crops (5) Driving away locusts (6) Violent flooding (7) Displaced people begging for food (8) Digging grass roots and stripping tree bark (9) Bandits forming groups (10) The starving fighting each other for food (11) Disease, suffering, cold, and hunger reach their extreme (12) Distributing grain to relieve the destitute

In response, the old man composed one long poem for each illustration, titled "Remaining Thoughts on Zheng's Paintings," and published them as a volume. I will present three of them:

Ninth Illustration: Bandits Forming Groups
"Small thieves engage in breaking and entering, large thieves engage in robbery. Acting with violence and bullying orphans and widows, pillaging and indulging their cunning. You people are also human - why is your inherent nature so treacherous? One after another they are imprisoned, one by one they face criminal punishment. I think of the words about deceiving the people - the underlying causes are almost impossible to explain. Stealing salaries to benefit their wives and children, abusing power to bring disaster to family and state. Such is the entire world in its vastness. Who can carry out proper punishment?"

How exhilarating are these final lines! Contemporary readers should recite them three times.

Tenth Illustration: The Starving Fighting Each Other for Food
"In human life, food is life itself. Without food there are no people. How appropriate was the government of the ancient kings - food came before funeral and sacrificial rites. Later generations valued money and goods, viewing food as something light and insignificant. They did not hesitate to disrupt farming seasons, found no difficulty in abandoning people's fields. Once they encounter famine and disaster, the starving form confused groups. Rolling up their sleeves they fight each other for food, voices harsh and faces filled with angry rage. There is no longer neighborhood goodwill - how could they know brotherly affection? How painful that among all things..."

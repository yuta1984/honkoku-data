On the 10th day of the 8th month of Tenbun 11 (1542), Oda Nobuhide and Imagawa Yoshimoto fought a battle at Azukizaka in Mikawa Province. From the Imagawa side, a warrior named Asahina Yasuhide made the first spear attack, but neither side had yet determined victory or defeat. At that time, seven brave warriors from the Oda side rushed forward and distinguished themselves with their military prowess. This is called the "Seven Spears of Azukizaka."

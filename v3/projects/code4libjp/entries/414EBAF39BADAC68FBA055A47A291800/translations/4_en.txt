1. History
The city of Toyohashi, recognizing the yearly increasing trend of tuberculosis patients and the urgent necessity of establishing a sanatorium, obtained approval from the city council in February 1934 to construct it with a budget of 84,000 yen. The funding sources included a national subsidy of 42,000 yen, municipal bonds of 33,000 yen, and other general revenues. Additionally, for housing entrusted patients, the city received an assistance grant of 17,000 yen from Aichi Prefecture.

On July 13, 1934, an establishment order was issued by the Minister of Home Affairs, followed by construction approval from the Minister of Home Affairs on September 26 of the same year. In selecting the location, careful on-site investigations were conducted, and the current suitable location was determined. Construction began in January 1935, was completed in October of the same year, and the hospital opened on December 1, 1935.

The location of this sanatorium is situated on hills in the eastern suburbs of the city, in an area originally called "Takayama Imperial Estate." With verdant mountains stretching in succession, rich natural scenery throughout the four seasons, and clean air, it was built on the south-facing slope of the foothills, where wind speeds are extremely mild and it is most convenient for receiving sunlight. Moreover, there are no unsanitary elements such as factories or polluted marshlands, and villages are also at a considerable distance. We believe this tuberculosis sanatorium occupies an excellent location with truly ideal conditions from a medical standpoint.

Three years have passed since the opening, and the number of patients seeking admission has increased yearly, frequently exceeding the capacity of 60 patients. At this time, we are determined to work even harder on facility improvements and strive to fulfill the founding purpose of this hospital.

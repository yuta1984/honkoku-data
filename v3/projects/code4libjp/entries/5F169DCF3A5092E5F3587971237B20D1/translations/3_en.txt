Though I had not shown it to anyone, somehow this matter reached the ears of Kōshodō. The master came quickly and said, "Rather than let this collection remain idle as a paper tiger's ornament, let us hurry to carve it on printing blocks and spread it in all directions. You too shall let me obtain it." Perhaps as recompense for this, he said there was something of quality, brought out a jewel box, and reverently opened it to reveal none other than that wondrous stone called the Golden Rooster. Indeed, if this stone were with me, it would surely be

equal to Kazurayama-jin's Crow Stone. It is so mysterious and feels like reaching an itch in just the right place. The joy is beyond words, so feeling like that maiden who obtained the celestial feathered robe, I have named it "Suruga Mai."

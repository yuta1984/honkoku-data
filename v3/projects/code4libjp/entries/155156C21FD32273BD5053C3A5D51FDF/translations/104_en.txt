Due to delays in land acquisition, the construction progress of both routes was hindered, and construction could not begin within the fiscal year. Additionally, the railway commissioned construction work on Hachimachi-dori did not proceed as planned. Finally, with the completion of paved road surface construction on November 30, 1935, work orders were issued, and thereafter earnest efforts were made to supervise construction. A partial modification was deemed necessary during construction, and the contract amount was revised to 52,467 yen and 3 sen, with completion on February 16, 1936.

1. Hanada Line Street Construction Work
Based on urban planning project implementation, a designated competitive bid was held on October 18, 1934, but due to budget overruns, an immediate re-bid with the same designated parties resulted in the contract being awarded to Sakata Shinkichi for 3,144 yen. A construction contract was concluded on October 28 of the same year. However, since property relocation was in progress at the time and construction could not begin, it was decided that completion should occur within ninety days from the order date. A work commencement order was issued on February 8, 1935, and efforts were made to proceed with construction as planned. However, unexpected delays occurred in obstacle removal, leading to construction postponement and suspension orders. Completion was announced on September 14 of the same year. During this period, modifications were deemed necessary for sections connecting to sewer construction work, and the contract price was revised to 3,054 yen and 99 sen, completing the project.

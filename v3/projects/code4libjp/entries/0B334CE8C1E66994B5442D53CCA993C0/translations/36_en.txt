mon, hence the name.) Uo-machi (Fish Town) was originally called Uoya-machi (Fishmonger Town). The fish market in this town has had a prosperity rare among all provinces since ancient times. Fish from Katahama thirteen ri away comes not only in summer but also from the coasts of Kinugatira, Enshū, and Sunshū to form markets. There is no interruption day or night. The name "Fish Town" is not empty. In terms of fire prevention, it leads all of Toyohashi town.

The prosperity of fire prevention is greatest in the fish district - Sekine Chidō
Among the fire brigade, young men / Strong bodies and skilled hands crown the fish district
Born without the habits of butchers and wine sellers / Spring wind and chivalrous spirit can be discerned

○Fox Mound, Head-cutting Jizō, Nyūdō Pool - Fox Mound is in Toyohashi Uo-machi, Head-cutting Jizō is in Nakashiba of the same area, and Nyūdō Pool is upstream on the Toyokawa Sekiya riverbank, and all of them transmit strange tales and mysterious legends.

○Kanoko Furisode - When the song "When passing through Yoshida, they beckon from the second floor, with kanoko tie-dyed furisode" began to be sung is not clear, but seeing that it appears in Onitsura's verses and others, it is evident that it was before the Genroku era. When investigating its origin, there was someone named Hayashi in the kimono district of Yoshida post station, and his family had a graceful and beautiful daughter who, for some reason, became restless in spirit and constantly wore kanoko tie-dyed furisode, beckoning to passersby from the second floor, which is said to be the origin of this song. However, some say it originated from courtesans at Yoshida post station beckoning customers from the second floor, while others say it came from a young lady at Yoshida Palace in Kyoto who behaved this way. Which is true is difficult to determine through investigation.

○Toyohashi Products - Yoshida sweet potatoes, nattō, bean hail (mamearare), chikuwa, and Yoshida sickles are traditional products, but recently developing as national products are tobacco manufactured by Harada Factory and silk production, which are worthy of pride among neighboring provinces. Next, soy sauce brewing and mandarin orange production should also be counted as products.

○Haneda Library (Autumn Leaves) - Located within the grounds of Haneda Hachiman Shrine in Hanada Village, managed by Shinto priest Hanedano. This was established in Kaei 2 by Fukutani Suichiku and five or six others from Yoshida post station. Beginning with donated books from Lord Sanjō Sanemasa and Lord Gen'retsu of Mito Domain, the collection reaches as many as 13,000 volumes. The four characters "Haneda Bunko" on the plaque are written by Wada, and the five large characters "Sekichū Gai Shotei" are by the brush of Right Minister Sanehiro Sanbō. The collection is widely available for public reading. There are also maple trees on the grounds, famous as a spot for autumn leaves. It is only five chō from Toyohashi Station.

○Muro Ferry Landing (Fishing) - About one ri west of Toyohashi town, where the famous Kanno Shinden is located. To Tahara town across four ri of sea, steamships make several round trips daily for the convenience of travelers. This coastline has gentle waves, and in autumn, fishing enthusiasts gather in groups.

Places called Muro are all by the seaside. "Muro" is a corruption of "mure" (group), meaning where people live in groups. Southwest in the sea from this place is a spot called Tatsuae, where rain prayers were once performed. The following poems in the Fuboku-shū that read "Tatsu no Hosoe" might refer to this place:

Poem by Lord Tomoke, Junior Third Rank
Offshore waves at Tatsu no Hosoe's hidden bay
Wondering if the wind blows too, boat people stop

Poem by Lord Yukinō, Junior Second Rank
At Okitsu wind and Tatsu no Hosoe's repeated waves
What accumulates is resentment

　　　〇Miscellaneous Poems on Eastern Mikawa Famous Sites　　　Takemoto Suizan

　　　Mount Miyaji
Climbing up, ten thousand trees are newly dyed. The four directions crimson red, charming in late spring. I do not know
what feast the heavenly lord holds. That enables the autumn goddess to intoxicate the mountain gods.
The traces of the golden palace have lasted through ages. Hesitating, I look back toward the setting sun. Elegantly
not sparing to pick red leaves. Viewing them as brocade bestowed upon people returning.

　　　Akasaka
Princess Kotobuki's historic site veiled in pale mist. The lonely post station, spring wind evokes much nostalgia. For a thousand ages
her fragrant soul has not dispersed. Still remaining as flowers by Chōfuku Temple.

　　　Climbing Mount Hongū in New Spring
Looking back, the northern sea appears like lotus flowers. The boundless view is from this peak. Fine streams
and clear springs flow in continuous pulse. Old cedars and tall cypresses cast layered shadows. The spring wind deeply conveys
divine virtue. Remaining snow still shows traces of the demon woman. All grains cooked together, offered in bamboo
tubes. Within them, how much fortune or misfortune is divined.

　　　Kokubunji Temple
The evening sun strikes and announces the old magnificent whale. One roar still preserves the voice of a thousand ages. Pitiful
that the golden immortal's gold has peeled away. Not as bright as the patron's luminance.

　　　Mount Otsu
The famous mountain pavilion stands amid green layers. Wind enters pine and bamboo, creating cool scenic interest. Close at hand
are misty waves and Kinuura boats. East and west, the railway and Goyu lamps. Idle clouds come to accompany
poetry-writing guests. Gentle birds grow familiar with tea-brewing monks. Seven or eight provinces all fall within one
view. The spirit delighted to the extreme, wants to soar up.

　　　Mount Toyokawa
The golden lion-dog's incense smoke rises slantwise without cease. With spring warmth, more people come to worship. Warblers sing
in trees beside the fox king's shrine. Ten thousand lanterns' light reflects on the deep blue garden flowers.
Startled to hear rushing thunder emerge from the Buddhist temple. The great drum over ten feet reports the hours with its sound. Where forests and springs
bloom like brocade. Crying birds and swimming fish are accustomed and unalarmed.

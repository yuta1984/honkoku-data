○Consultation hours: 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM
　However, house calls in the afternoon; on Sundays and major festivals, medical staff provide consultations
○Inpatient treatment
　Previously, we often had to refuse admissions due to the narrow patient rooms, but we have now completed construction of a large new patient ward, so from now on inpatient treatment can be freely accepted.

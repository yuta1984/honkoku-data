Meiwa 6, year of the Metal Ox, summer, fourth month - recorded by the Owari hermit Yaari

The second [Bashō mound] is located beside the Motosaka highway in front of Saimyō-ji Temple gate in Hachiman Village.
　　Heat shimmer rising to my shoulder from paper clothes　—Bashō

The third is in the precincts of Kannon Hall in Kōfu-machi, erected by Hiramatsu Yoshiharu.
　　Red plum blossoms—unseen love creates jeweled bamboo blinds　—Bashō

The Mikawa Moshiogusa records: Long ago when Master Bashō stayed as a guest for a while at Shirai Umeka's place in our Kōfu village, thunder fell into someone's well in this village. People gathered and covered it with something like a strange noodle board. Hearing that thunder had been captured alive nearby, the master came here guided by Umeka, approached the well bottom, and when they removed the cover, there was nothing there. The master, host, and one other—three people—clapped their hands and laughed, composed a haikai verse, and returned.

　With no word of brightening dawn, the thunder god
　　　has met his end at the bottom of the well

●Maeshiba Port Located at the mouth of the Toyokawa River in Maeshiba Village, Ōaza Maeshiba. It is just over one ri from Toyohashi. Ship traffic is frequent and there is a lighthouse at the port. White fish (shirauo) are a famous local product for which the area is renowned.

　　　Maeshiba White Fish　　　　　Sekine Chidō
　Crystalline and white, small ones first to fall / Better than discussing coins and pearls
　At the wine shop's stove in spring, paintable / Selling crystal fish with jade-slender calculating rods

　　　Hakutō Collection　　　　　　Ōta Kinjo
　Precarious mast holds slender moon / Returning boat carries gentle breeze / Where are the fishing fires?
　Flickering bright and dim among reed flowers

　　　Biwa Garden Verse Collection　　　Shirō
　Floating up, yet writing nothing of floating—this sea cucumber

●Omika Port The coastline continuing from Maeshiba. In ancient times it was a cape, and the Areno-saki mentioned in the Man'yōshū is probably this Omika Port.

　　Song from when the Retired Emperor visited Mikawa Province in Taihō 2 (702)
　Where again might ships find harbor at Areno Cape?
　　　　Rowing wearily onward in a small boat without deck planking

According to oral tradition, in the second year of Taihō (702) during the reign of the 42nd Human Emperor Monmu, Retired Empress Jitō made an imperial visit to this village and temporarily established a traveling palace. At that time it was called Hikuma Field, and common people lived in thatched huts built here and there. Over 400 years after the retired empress's return, during the Bunji era under the 82nd Emperor Go-Toba, Hiki Tōkurō Morinaga, a retainer of Minamoto no Yoritomo (the Second Rank), was granted lands in Hoi District. When Lord Yoritomo was exiled to Izu Province, he made a prayer vow for the restoration of the Minamoto house to the great priest Daizen of Hōkoku-san Zenpuku-ji Temple in Tanno Village of this district. After Yoritomo's restoration, he had Morinaga outfit a saddled horse to offer to the temple hall. This horse spiritedly came out into the village areas, stopped at this village, and spent several months eating the young grass of Hikuma.

The villagers called this horse "Omika" (honorable horse), from which the place name arose.

●Gamagōri Town The location of the Tōkaidō Railway station. In recent years a seaside bathing area has been established on the coast, with wealthy families' villas and such, creating great crowds in summer. This region was formerly called Gamagata. This name probably originated when Minamoto no Noriyori became Mikawa Governor and built his castle here. Noriyori was born in Gama in Tōtōmi Province and was called Gama Kanja.

○Koi no Matsubara (Love Pine Grove) Refers to the pine groves along the seashore from Gamagōri to Katahara. To the south one can see the mountains of Atsumi District, and at the end is Irago

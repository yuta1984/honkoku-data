Guide to Famous Sites of Eastern Mikawa
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Editor: Sanyōshi

Preface

Mikawa Province was called "Ho-no-kuni" (Land of Rice Ears) and "Mikawa-no-kuni" (Land of the Imperial River) in ancient times, later renamed Mikawa, and at some point came to be distinguished as Eastern Mikawa and Western Mikawa. Eastern Mikawa centers around Toyohashi with the five counties of Kita-Shitara, Minami-Shitara, Yana, Hoi, and Atsumi connected to each other, while Western Mikawa centers around Okazaki with the five counties of Higashi-Kamo, Nishi-Kamo, Nukata, Hekikai, and Hazu linked together. The land of Mikawa is not without so-called famous places and historical sites that should be preserved, yet I have not heard of any guidebooks for these places.

I believe that introducing scenic spots widely to society not only serves as reference for history and geography and as a guide for summer retreats and winter escapes, but also becomes material for transportation and guidance for travelers, contributing no small amount to the prosperity of the region. Therefore, as a first step, we have come to publish this volume. However, due to the hasty compilation, the editor apologizes in advance to the public for any inadequacies in detail and omission.

This book is called "Guide to Famous Sites of Eastern Mikawa." It is not merely a collection of so-called famous places and historical sites, but broadly includes famous government offices, commercial establishments, and the like of the present time. This is precisely why we chose the term "famous sites."

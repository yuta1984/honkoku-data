Four

　　　Adera Child-Embracing Stone
By the seven-tiered waterfall, strangely shaped stones exist. Each stone embraces a child stone. The countenance of
General Zhao who saved his young lord. The figure of the great minister who protected the unborn child. Pitiably, though their nature is
stubborn to the core. They are lovable, resembling kindness from long ago. Skillfully, this preserves the way of
fatherhood among people. Though merely pebbles and stones, they become teachers to humanity.

　　　Ōno Inkstone River
The river's shape resembles an inkstone in the blue depths. Perfectly suited for clouds and mist, light and dark. With fragrant ink,
grinding and polishing the shadows of flowers and trees. With green brush, sweeping away the wind of willow branches. The writing implements are known to be
implements of immortals. Their elegant taste particularly becomes the work of creation. I would like to ask what was
painted in those days. The hermit Rishū atop Mount Hōrai.

　　　Hōrai Temple
When the era of military dominance ended, even the golden halls became desolate. The Zen temple too witnessed the vicissitudes of time. I don't know where
the immortal sage departed to. I want to ask about the phoenix that soared in those days. The twelve zodiac deities
are silently vacant. The stipend of a thousand koku has finally become vast and empty. Climbing up the
path to the summit of Gyōja Ridge. As before, the mountain pavilion carries the fragrance of fermented soybeans.

　　　Visiting the Grave of Torii Katsutaka at Nagashino
A single heart cannot be taken away. Upon the crucifixion stake, his body was killed. His righteous valor was like metal and iron.
For a thousand autumns, ghosts and spirits weep.

　　　Cherry Abyss
The water is warm, weeping willows sleep. The wind is light, small boats pass through. Where cherry blossom shadows sink.
Fish leap within brocade clouds.

　　　Honeycomb Rock
The water below Honeycomb Rock. One should draw from this clear stream. I ask, does the sake of Shinshiro,
when brewed, resemble honey or not?

　　　○Eight Views of Eastern Pilgrimage　　　　　Author Unknown
　Not knowing from what period these were composed, from among the
　eight-view poems and songs dedicated to Kumano Daigongen at
　Nagayama Kubo Saigō Shrine, I have excerpted one waka poem each. Perhaps
　they were composed during the Keichō era before the Tokugawa period.

　　　Toyokawa Returning Sails
　Inviting toward the direction of longing, with sails on the Toyokawa
　　　　River, boat people return following the waves

　　　Hoshino Falling Geese
　In the heavenly sky, even the stars cast shadows
　　　　Hidden in the pond water, geese are falling

　　　Ishimaki Autumn Moon
　The unmoving rocky roots of the mountain clearly
　　　　Appear in moonlight throughout the autumn night

　　　Hongū Evening Snow
　Mountain shapes resembling islands are buried
　　　　Peaks beautiful in the evening glow of snow

　　　Honno Clear Storm
　Deep green, even the storm sways with color

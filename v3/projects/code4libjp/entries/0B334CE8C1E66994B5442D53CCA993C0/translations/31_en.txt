The five counties of Eastern Mikawa are: Atsumi County, Hoi County, Yana County, Minami-Shitara County, and Kita-Shitara County. Among these five counties, Atsumi and Hoi are coastal regions, while Yana and the northern and southern Shitara counties are mountainous areas. However, thanks to the flow of the Toyokawa River and the convenience of railways, transportation between sea and land has developed increasingly. Timber and other goods from the mountains immediately gather at the Toyohashi market and are shipped to various places, while seafood from the coast is transported instantly, allowing even the mountain areas of northern and southern Shitara to have fresh fish on their tables the same day. The five counties are almost like neighbors.

Among the urban areas in Eastern Mikawa, Toyohashi town ranks first. Indeed, the prosperity of Toyohashi surpasses even Okazaki town and Hamamatsu town in Tōtōmi, truly holding the first position in both Mikawa and Tōtōmi provinces. The place second to Toyohashi in Eastern Mikawa is Shinshiro town in Minami-Shitara County, followed by Ōno town in Yana County, Ebi town in Minami-Shitara County, Toyokawa town in Hoi County, Tahara town in Atsumi County, and others. Goyu and Akasaka towns in Hoi County no longer retain their former appearance. Next, though not famous historical sites but recent establishments, the horse breeding station at Mount Dando in Kita-Shitara County and the Nakayama Artillery Testing Ground in Nakayama Village, Atsumi County, are both government facilities adding considerable luster to the region of Eastern Mikawa.

Guide to Famous Sites of Eastern Mikawa

○ Atsumi County

●Origin: In ancient times, the flow of the Toyokawa River was not as it is today. The area around Toyokawa town was the river mouth, with bays extending east to Ushikawa village, west to Kozakai and Ushikubo towns, north to around Ichinomiya, and south from Yoshidakata and Muro villages to the area of Akumi in Toyohashi town, which was all inlet sea. The Man'yōshū contains verses like "Launching a great ship into the rough sea" and "The white waves of the high rough sea," which derive from the turbulent waves around the present-day Akumi area of Toyohashi town. The term "rough sea" (araumi) likely transformed into "Akumi." Considering that the Wamyō-shō refers to "Azumi" and mentions an "Akumi" village in Atsumi, the origin of Atsumi County can be said to have been naturally named through the transformation of the word "Akumi."

●Toyokawa River: Also called Yoshida River or Ane River. Its source rises in Kita-Shitara, flows through Minami-Shitara, runs along the borders of Yana, Atsumi, and Hoi counties, and empties into Kinugasa Bay. Therefore, the prosperity of Toyohashi—indeed, the convenient development of all five counties of Eastern Mikawa—owes much to the flow of this Toyokawa River. The scenic beauty of various places along its banks is as described below, and many of Eastern Mikawa's famous sites owe their renown to this waterway.

　Poem by Kinugasa Naidaijin:
　If hunters lodge tonight at Yahagi,
　　　　Will they cross tomorrow the waves of Toyokawa?

　Poem by Masayo, former Dainagon:
　How many nights with temporary pillow on Toyokawa—
　　　　Hastening toward the end of morning-rising waves

　Yoshida River was formerly called Toyokawa; now about two ri north of this river there is Toyo

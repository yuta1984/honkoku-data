stone bridge. The scenic beauty of this area is most exceptional, and there are those who come from afar, cultured visitors walking with staffs. Chiiwa (Milk Rock), Tainai-dō (Womb Cave), Oni-ishi (Demon Stone), Ana-daki (Hole Waterfall), Semi-ga-daki (Cicada Waterfall), Hyakken-daki (Hundred-ken Waterfall), and Myōken-yama are collectively called the Eight Scenic Spots of Kawai. All are within about one ri from Kawai village, with fantastic rocks and precipitous cliffs beyond description. Since horse-drawn carriages and rickshaws travel from Ōno Town in Yana District, it is said that sightseeing visitors have been coming in succession recently.

Stone Bridge - Shōda Gensen
The rocky milk mountain is even harder to climb, cold in the blue storm and green mist of old
People who arrive at this secluded deep place only pay respects to the peaceful seated Kannon

●Bessho Castle Ruins: About three ri northeast from Ōaza Kawai in Miwa Village along the Bessho highway to Hongō Village, and across the Furikusa River lie the ruins of Bessho Castle. According to tradition, it was built by Takeda Shingen of Kai Province as a defense against invasion of the Mikawa region from the Iida area.

●Fukuden-ji Temple (Shingen's Grave): Located in Ōaza Taguchi, Taguchi Village, this Rinzai Zen temple was founded in Ōei 9 (1402), and its principal image, Jizō Bodhisattva, was carved by Gyōki. As recorded in the section on Noda Castle ruins in Minami-Shitara District mentioned earlier, Takeda Shingen's grave is within the temple grounds. There is also a burial mound dedicated to Baba Nobufusa, Mino-no-kami, who died in the Battle of Nagakute. The ancient blue-green color of the five-story stone pagoda is deeply moving.

●Gosho-gaitsu and Gosho-daira (Mayumi-yama): When Southern Court First Rank Commanding General and Minister of War Prince Yukinaga led troops toward Mikawa, on the 15th day of the 8th month of Ōei 31 (1424), after passing through Iida and Komaba Ōno, guerrilla fighters attacked from various places and most of his soldiers were killed, so he finally entered a private house in Namiai, Ina District, Shinano Province, and committed suicide, according to old records. The prince was the son of Prince Muneyoshi, and his mausoleum is in Gosho-gaitsu, Bussetsu Village. There is also a place called Gosho-daira in Ōaza Sakaba, Toyone Village, where there is a small shrine dedicated to Prince Yukinaga. It is known for its Hanesuo flowers.

When Prince Yukinaga was pressured by the Ashikaga family and went to Nitta in Kōzuke, he entered Bussetsu Township in Mikawa Province and composed this poem while viewing the moon over Mayumi Mountain:
Faintly brightening, as I gaze at the dawning sky
The moon alone shines clear behind the western mountain

Death poem:
Who would have thought that after escaping so many deep rapids
I would sink here in this Namiai

From Horikawa Hyakushu - Imperial Princess's Lady-in-waiting Kii:
Gathering companions, thinking to practice archery
In autumn we shall enter Mayumi Mountain

○Goten Village and Sono Village (Imperial Ruins): Even just the village names seem to have some historical significance. According to tradition, there is Goten Mountain northwest of Goten Village, and it is said this name arose because Emperor Monmu resided here before ascending to the throne. The truth cannot be determined. Also, in Sono Village, in the area called Higashi-sonome, there is a place called Ōiri, and according to tradition, after Emperor Kazan was persuaded by Fujiwara no Michikane to become a monk at Gangō-ji, when he secretly made pilgrimages to various provinces, he briefly stopped here. Originally written as "Ō-iri" (King's Entry), this was changed to avoid impropriety to "Ō-iri" (Great Entry), and the pronunciation was called Hanayama. Such oral traditions still exist today. Both villages seem to have historical significance, but reliable proof cannot be obtained.

●Tsugu no Sato: This refers to present-day Kami-tsugu and Shimo-tsugu villages. In ancient times it was called Binkaga-hara Chigu no Sato, but from some point it came to be called Tsugu, and now the character for "chi" (thousand) has been changed to "tsu" (harbor), as seen in the Sandai Jitsuroku. According to oral tradition, when Emperor Yōzei made an imperial visit to Sonohara Mountain in Shinano Province, his imperial procession passed through this Mikawa route and stayed overnight in Chigu no Sato, and it happened to be in the fourth month

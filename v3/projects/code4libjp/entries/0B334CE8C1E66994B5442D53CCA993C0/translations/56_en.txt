From the cape one can see Ise Province's Mount Asama and other peaks—a truly magnificent view.

　Is it perhaps in faint hope of still meeting
　　　　that the Love Pine Grove began to flourish?
　　　Fuji Rekiran-ki　　　　　　Middle Counselor Masakō
　Who in ancient times first gave the name
　　　　after the cold indifference of one who waits at Love Pine Grove?

○Site of Lord Shunzei's Residence The Shaguji Forest in Oe Village is said to be that place. Before the Genryaku era, Imperial Empress Dowager's Master Shunzei lived here and developed the two estates of Takeya and Uragata.

　The green color unchanged, constant through the world
　　　　How many generations unchanging, the village of Takeya
　　　In Mikawa　　　　　　Shirō
　Drying sea cucumbers, the cold of sleeves, crying plovers

○Islands and Sea Bathing Offshore from Mitani-machi are Ōshima, Kojima, and Hotoke Island. Takeshima belongs to Gamagōri and has a Benzaiten shrine. Also in the sea off Katahara Village is Kame Rock. All have excellent scenery, and many people come from far and near to pole boats and fish, enjoying water excursions. Especially the various coastal areas—beginning with Gamagōri, then Mitani, Omika, Maeshiba, etc.—are suitable for sea bathing, so during the intense heat of summer, crowds of tourists come to escape the heat.

○Ōshima (Solar Salt Production) Belongs to Mitani. Since ancient times, those pressed by poverty in the village have relied on the village community to move to this island and make their living. With the benefits of firewood, charcoal, rice fields, and seafood, they invariably escape their household poverty. This practice continues today. In this area, the following poem is widely transmitted as being by Lord Shunzei:
　Ōshima and beyond Kojima, Hotoke Island
　　　　In Suzume Forest, Love Pine Grove
　　　Fuboku Collection　　　　　　Kiyohara no Ason Motosuke
　The small grains of sand at Miyahama—
　　　　let us count my lord's treasure ranks

In recent years, a solar salt production facility (90 ken long, 24 ken wide) under patent from the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce has been opened on this island, achieving quite good results.

○Takeshima Benzaiten Shrine One of the three Benzaiten shrines of this province. Together with Enoshima in Sagami Province, Itsukushima in Aki Province, Amanogawa in Kii Province, Chikubushima in Ōmi Province, Fuse in Hitachi Province, Nojiri in Shimotsuke Province, and Takeshima in Mikawa Province, these are called the Seven Heavenly Maidens of Japan. It is transmitted that in ancient times Lord Shunzei transplanted bamboo from Chikubushima in Ōmi Province to this island, hence the name Takeshima.

●Kusunoki's Sarugaku In the first year of Genkō (1321), after the fall of Akasaka Castle, Kusunoki Masashige came with Onchi Sakon-tarō to Sarugaku Mountain on the border between Hiroishi and Kōfu, performed sarugaku, showed it to passersby, and spied on the military might of the Kantō, according to tradition.

●Oguri Hangwan's Hidden Residence Oguri Kojirō Sukeshige, who was sung of with Oguri Hangwan and Princess Teruru, fled from Kamakura and took lodging with his relative, the village samurai Sōbei of Akane Village, it is said.

"River is a place name, not a river. This is probably what the Fudoki refers to as the dwelling place of the wealthy man of Toyokawa." - Yamazaki An'sai

East and west, fishing commands postal stations / Along the main road, green pines form rows
The wind's color is truly abundant, wind and water peaceful / Yoshida castle town, Yoshida River
- From Mizunoto-mi Kikō (1653) by Hayashi Dōshun

Yoshida, ancient battlefield / Once success was achieved, imperial fortune grew long
On what can traveling guests rely to boast of Zichan? / Superior to Gangwei without bridges
- From Tōyū Kikō by Yamazaki An'sai

A small boat follows the flowing song / From horseback, briefly watching the pleasant short oar
Maku and Xue Zhang left advice / Writing for you as I depart from Yoshida Bridge
- Moon Viewing on Toyomizu (two poems) by Hakujotei

West of Toyomizu Bridge in the twilight sky / Boarding the bright moon boat at the fifteenth hour
The autumn wind brings no homesick dreams / For now, spending half a year for the sake of sea bass

What harm in staying long for poetry and wine / Again pursuing elegant interest in a light boat
Complete pickles, jewel-like sashimi, crystal moon / All together making a Mid-Autumn night excursion

Toyokawa Bamboo Branch Songs (two poems) - Sekine Chidō
Cloud-like hair, moon-combing, both beautiful / Pavilions beyond flowers, boats beyond willows
Not counting Weiyang's twenty-fourth spring / This one bridge claims these fine wind and mist

A thousand households prosperous, water in one river / Masts stand like a forest under the sea gate sky
As if having the art of supporting gold measures / Iron-cast long bridge connecting fire ships

●Toyohashi: Located at the northern end of Atsumi County, facing the south bank of the Toyokawa River. In ancient times it was called Imahashi, and until the Meiji Restoration it was called Yoshida. Yoshida Castle was built four hundred years ago in the second year of Eishō (1505) during Emperor Go-Kashiwabara's reign by Makino Naritoki, a retainer of Imagawa Ujichika. Later, the Ōkōchi clan, descendants of Matsudaira Nobutsuna (Chie-no-Izu), ruled this castle town with a domain of 70,000 koku until the beginning of the Meiji period. In Meiji 18 (1885), the 18th Infantry Regiment was stationed in the former castle grounds, followed by the establishment of the 17th Brigade headquarters. Currently, investigations are underway to implement city status.

At the place called Imahashi
- Former Dainagon Masayo
For your sake, crossing Imahashi from now on
How many thousands of generations will it span?

Lodging at Imahashi
- Priest Gyōkō
Together with the night, the moon crosses clearly at Imahashi
Standing and lingering until past dawn

From Tōkaidō Diary by Ono Michijo:
Because it bears the name of my hometown, how dear it is
Even though it's not the Yoshida of the capital

On the 29th, we stayed at a place called Goyu. When passing through a place called Yoshida, we heard many cuckoos singing, which we had not heard in our hometown
- Kōgen-in Taifu-jin

Even the first song was still unfamiliar, cuckoo
Spending days listening to voices that sing briefly

On the 3rd day of the intercalary 10th month of Tenmei 6 (1786), when Nyōin Shibayama Saishō Mochitomi-kyō came up from the Kantō region and stayed at Ōki Jūemon's residence:

The lingering reluctance to depart from this travel lodge
The host's deep kindness like the depths of night

Meeting at Mikawa Torinosu:
Not hiding it - the inn with vegetable soup and red pepper - Bashō

With Etsujin at Yoshida station:
Though cold, two-person travel sleeping is pleasant - Same person
Travel sleeping, did I see the world's year-end cleaning - Etsujin

Staying at Yoshida sake shop Hanagyū:
Let me rise to see the Indian summer through the sake storehouse window - Hasei

From Hinoe-tatsu Kikō by Hayashi Dōshun

strong, so rain, snow, clouds, and mist gather easily. From this, water is produced. There are also springs from which water directly gushes forth. Mountain water accumulates and first becomes "beek" <<marginal note: pond water in valleys>>, then flows down to become rivers, rivers merge to become "stroom" <<marginal note: where rivers are about to enter the sea>>, and enter the sea. "Beek" is narrow and shallow. Rivers are somewhat broader. However, they are still in high places and should be crossed on foot. When reaching flat land, they should be navigated and crossed by boat. Sometimes rivers flow directly down from steep and high places. This is called a waterfall <<marginal note: waterval>>.

Rivers have the distinction of right bank and left bank. Facing toward the mouth of the river, the right is called the right bank and the left the left bank. The greatest rivers are in Europe: "Garonne," "Loire," "Rhine," "Elbe," "Vistula," "Don," "Volga," "Dnieper," "Danube," "Po," "Rhône," "Ebro," "Tagus." In Asia: "Ob," "Lena," "Amur," "Fano," "Ganges," "Indus," "Tigris," "Euphrates." In Africa: "Nile," "Senegal," "Zaire." In America: "St. Lawrence," "Mississippi," "Amazon," "Rio," "La Plata."

"Strait" refers to a narrow bay's sea gate where it narrows between two lands. The most notable is that of "Calais"

Chapter 4: Geography by Natural Philosophers

The entire surface of the earth is mostly water, and land is extremely scarce. According to the theory of precise geographers, if the world were divided into three parts, water would constitute two parts and land one part. This water is called "Weereld-zee" (meaning world ocean), and land is called "Land." The utility of the sea is great. Its water evaporates and rises to become clouds, which follow the wind to cover the earth widely, moistening it, transporting fresh water, making the atmosphere clean and cool, and giving rise to rivers and streams. Also, people float on the sea to visit distant lands, exchange what they have and lack with each other, and mutually transmit learning and arts.

"Land" (territory) receives various names according to its size, position, and shape. Namely: "Vastland" (mainland), "Landengte" (narrow land), "Eiland" (island), "Schiereiland" (peninsula), "Vlakland" (plain), "Berg" (mountain), "Berg-engte" (gorge), "Bergketen" (mountain chain), "Heuvel" (hill), "Duin" (dike), "Vallei" or "Dal" (valley), "Kaap" (cape), "Kust" (coast), "Strand" (shore), etc.

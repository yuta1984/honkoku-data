The land in the western hemisphere and the land in the eastern hemisphere do not have connecting soil. The so-called "Vasteland" (continent) consists of one small continent and two large continents. That is, one large continent is within the western hemisphere, and one is within the eastern hemisphere together with the small continent. These three parts, combined with other small continents, are divided into five worlds. The five worlds are the so-called Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and Australia.

Europe and Asia do not actually have a true distinction between them. Asia and Africa are connected by soil through merely one strip of narrow land. South America and North America are also connected by soil through one narrow strip of land. This narrow land is named "Land-engte" (isthmus). The narrow land where Asia and Africa connect is named the "Suez" "Land-engte," and that which connects South America and North America is named the "Panama" or "Darien" "Land-engte."

Islands (Eiland) are land surrounded by sea on all four sides. The largest of these are "Groot-Britannia" "Ierland" "IJsland" "Spitsbergen" "Java en Sumatra." Also "Hebro" "Orkazi" "Atsuri"

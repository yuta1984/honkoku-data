follows the movement and position of the moon. When the moon reaches its extreme point relative to that location, it takes one and a half hours for the tide to reach its extreme point. After that, it retreats westward in one to two minutes (a "minute" is one-hundred-and-twentieth of an hour), reaches the extreme of low tide in three hours, and again the tide comes from the east in one to two minutes, which also takes three hours. However, the timing of the tide is delayed by 49 minutes each day. This is because the moon's passage through the meridian is delayed by 49 minutes each day. Also, depending on the position of landmasses, the depth of the seabed, and the configuration of coastlines, tides may deviate from their normal patterns. In the East Sea (Oost-Zee), the Mediterranean Sea, and the Caspian Sea, the advance and retreat of tides is not distinct.

The sea's light green color is pleasing to the human eye. The deepest seas are dark black in color. Holstel says, "The green color of the sea is a reflection of the blue color of the sky. As the water becomes deeper, the reflection becomes increasingly intense and turns dark blue. Therefore, one can distinguish the depth and shallows of the sea by its color."

Seawater sometimes emits light at night. There are three types of this. One is

kiring) or (Kreeft's Keerkring) {summer solstice line}, and that which lies south of the equator is called (Zuider Keerkring) {meaning southern tropic} or (Steenbok's Keerkring) {winter solstice line}.

The two poles PP of the equator are each ninety degrees from the equator, and the two poles PP of the ecliptic are also each ninety degrees from the ecliptic. The poles of the ecliptic are twenty-three and a half degrees away from the poles of the equator. This is the same as the degree of mutual obliquity between the ecliptic and the equator. A circle is drawn between the poles of the equator and the poles of the ecliptic. This is called the polar circle (called Poolcirkels). It has this name because it encircles the locations of both poles of the earth. These are pCCr in the second figure and GGGG in the first figure. That which is in the north is called the northern circle, and that which is in the south is called the southern circle.

The earth is divided into five parts to determine cold and warmth. There is one torrid zone, two temperate zones, and two frigid zones. The land of the torrid zone is between the two tropic lines. An area of approximately 4,821,159 ri of land belongs to this. The land of the temperate zones lies between the tropic lines and the polar circles. There are two zones, north and south, each with an area of 18,494,007 ri. The frigid zones are within the polar circles, with two zones north and south, each with an area of 386,705 ri.

People living in the torrid zone have the sun directly overhead twice a year

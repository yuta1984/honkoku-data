The mutual distances between them are determined by ten degrees each. This is established to make it easier to distinguish the degrees of east and west when viewing maps.

"Evenwijden" (parallels) belong to the same series as the equator, being small circles spanning east to west, with intervals of ten degrees each. These are established to distinguish the degrees from the equator to the north and south poles.

By means of all the above circles, one should distinguish the directions of various places. This is the distinction between latitude ("Brede") and longitude ("Lengte").

Latitude is the degree of distance north and south from the equator. There is a distinction between north latitude and south latitude. Longitude is the degree of distance eastward from the prime meridian. In geography books written by the English, there is a division between east longitude and west longitude.

Chapter Three: Ecliptic and Tropics (namely solsticial lines) "Poolkirkels" "Rugtkesteldheeden"

Following the annual revolution, the points where the Earth directly faces the Sun are collected and a line is drawn to form one great circle. This is called the ecliptic ("Zonneweg"). This line pierces through the center of the Earth and intersects with the equator, forming a difference of twenty-three and a half degrees with it.

The eie in the second figure and EEE in the first figure are the points where the Earth directly faces the ecliptic.

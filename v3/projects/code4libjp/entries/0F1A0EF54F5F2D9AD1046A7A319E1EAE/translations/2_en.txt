New Interpretation of World Geography

Chapter 1: General Overview
There are three types of geography. The first is called "Wis-Kyundehe" (mathematical geographers') geography, the second is called "Natuur-Kyundehe" (natural geographers') geography, and the third is called "Staat-Kyundehe" (political geographers') geography. "Wis-Kyundehe" geography involves drawing the North and South poles and equatorial reference lines on the globe to demarcate degrees, minutes, and distances, correlating these with fixed stars. "Natuur-Kyundehe" geography explains the fundamental principles regarding the natural properties of matter related to the earth. "Staat-Kyundehe" geography deals with national boundaries both extensive and narrow, administrative divisions of states and counties, religion and politics.

My (Kazan's) analysis: The meaning of "Wis" and "Kyundehe" refers to scholars or academics. This is the study of distributing heaven and earth. It differs from the limited perspective of Chinese astronomical disaster divination. "Natuur" means natural heavenly principle, and the reason it is called "natural" refers to the fundamental principle in natural philosophy, indicating that all things emerge from this primordial transformation. Heaven and earth both possess this. This study discusses only what pertains to the land. This is a discipline that never existed in China.

The equator and meridian are called "ki" (規) and also called "sen" (線), but this is not consistent. Whether called lines or circles, they are all artificial representations on globes.

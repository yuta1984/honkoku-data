continue and spread widely in all directions, far and near. Those that protrude into the sea are called islands. These are precisely the mountaintops.

Naturalists focus primarily on understanding mountain ranges in geography. Now I will list their outline below.

The highest place in Europe is the Alps mountains of Switzerland. Among them, the southwest is the highest, and this peak is called "Mont Blanc." Its height is approximately 14,000 feet. This mountain on the southern side bordering Italy is called "Alpen," that on the western side bordering France is called "Schwarzwald," and that at the eastern end is called "Arlberg." That which forms the boundary between Spain and France is called "Pyrenees." This is a branch of the Jura mountains. This mountain still extends across Spain, crosses the Strait of Gibraltar and connects to the mountains of Africa, spans across Turkey, and joins with the Taurus and Caucasus mountains of Asia.

The second highest place in Europe is in central Russia, at latitude 53-54 degrees, longitude 52

Each is at a distance of ninety degrees AA. This divides the earth equally into northern and southern parts, hence the name "dividing line" ("Evenaar"). The dividing line is also divided into 360 degrees, with each degree being fifteen ri in German road measurement, or twenty "Uur." One ri in German measurement corresponds to 1,967 Roede of "Rheinland" (in six-shaku measurement, one ri equals thirty-one chō, one ken, and eight bu).

The second large circle is the meridian ("Middaf-Kirkels"). It is like BBB. Among these, CC is designated as the prime meridian. These various circles are lines spanning north to south, and both their ends converge at the North and South Poles. This is determined by where the sun is at noon, so it differs according to location, and the number is unlimited.

In any region, when the sun reaches this line, it is called noon time. Therefore, it is named the noon line (meridian).

Where each local meridian ends is determined as due south by the horizon. The prime meridian is not uniform in where each place stands; sometimes the one passing over "Ferro" (place name) is used as the prime meridian, or sometimes those passing over "Tenerife" (Fukushima), "Greenwich," "Paris," "Vienna," "Petersburg," "Uppsala" (all place names above) are used.

The prime meridian divides the earth east and west just as the equator divides it north and south. The other meridians are their...

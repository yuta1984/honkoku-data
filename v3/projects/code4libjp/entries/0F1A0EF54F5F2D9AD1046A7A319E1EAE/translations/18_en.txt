"Poelen" <<marginal note: marsh>> refers to stagnant water within a country that does not communicate with river flows, has no waves, remains still and serves no purpose. Those that are shallow and mixed with mud and soil are named "Moerassen."

Chapter 5: Atmosphere and Wind

According to the geography of naturalists, there are three categories of things belonging to the Earth: namely, the atmosphere, earth, and water. Here we first explain the atmosphere.

There is a kind of fluid substance covering the entire surface of the Earth, surrounding it. Its nature is fine and highly elastic. It provides vital energy to animals and plants. This is called air

<<marginal note: "Lucht">>. In the air, vapor <<marginal note: "Dampen">> constantly evaporates and rises, and clouds and mist float about. All of this is collectively named the atmosphere.

The power of air consists of elasticity and gravity. Elasticity refers to the force by which it contracts when compressed and expands when released. Gravity refers to the force by which the accumulation of air constantly presses down on all associated objects.

"De La Hire" <<marginal note: person's name>> once experimented with this and found that the gravity of air originates from a height of thirty-five thousand three hundred sixty-three "Toisen," or nine and a half "Meilen" from the earth. Why

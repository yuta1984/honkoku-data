Chihaya no Mikoto and others are thought to have resided in the vicinity of Ōki Village in Hōi District, as already stated in the section on Izumo Tenjin in the lower volume of Kansha Shikō, and also in the section on Sōsha in the appendix.

Thus, regarding provincial governors (kokushi), they were first appointed during the reign of Emperor Kōtoku, but it is unclear who was the first appointee.

The Shoku Nihongi (vol. 3, folio 23) states: "On the jitatsu day of the ninth month of Keiun 3 [706], Junior Fifth Rank Lower Sakaaibe no Sukune Mitamaro was made governor of Mikawa." The same work (vol. 6, folio 4) states: "On the teishi day of the eighth month of Wadō 6 [713], Junior Fifth Rank Lower Enoi no Asomi Hirokuni was made governor of Mikawa." These are the first instances seen in official histories, and many more appear in subsequent reigns. This should be discussed in the relevant sections of each reign in the Rekidai Jiseki Kō.

Kuni no miyatsuko (provincial chieftain) means "provincial retainer," referring to one who serves as the Emperor's retainer and governs that province as its head.

Kokushi (provincial governor) is a general term for shu (governor), suke (assistant governor), jō (secretary), and sakan (clerk). The reason this is called "mikoromochi" is that it means "command-bearer," referring to one who receives and holds the Emperor's great command and administers the government of that province - so states Motoori Norinaga. Also, "sakan" refers to the government office, while "shu" refers to the person. As stated in the Ryōi-ki as "kuni no kami," according to Tanigawa Shissei.

The Sen'gaku Man'yōshō (vol. 18, folio 8) states: "Mikoromochi refers to provincial governors. The provincial governor goes down to his appointed province with an imperial edict, hangs that edict above the regular seat in the provincial office, and conducts government business before it."

[On Travel Distances] The Zatsurō (vol. 10, folio 27) states: "Generally, ten bu make one sun, ten sun make one shaku (one shaku two sun make one large shaku), and ten shaku make one jō." It also states: "Generally, when measuring land and weighing silver, copper, and grain, all use the large measure. For all else, both official and private use the small measure." Also: "Generally, when measuring land, five shaku make one bu, and three hundred bu make one ri."

The Engi Zasshiki (vol. 50, folio 2) states: "Generally, for all measurements and weights, both official and private use the large measure. However, when measuring sundial shadows and mixing hot tea, use the small measure. For that measurement, six shaku make one bu, and the rest is the same."

Thus, measuring land uses the large shaku, which corresponds to one shaku two sun of the small shaku. The small shaku is the same as today's curved ruler. Therefore, though the names differ between five and six shaku, there is no difference in the actual area of land, as stated in the Seikei Zusetsu. Hence, one ri in ancient imperial times corresponds to about five chō today.

The Shukei-shiki (vol. 24, folio 14) states: "Mikawa Province travel distance: eleven days going up, six days going down." This extract was probably recorded based on that document.

Travel distance refers to the journey from Kyoto to the provincial capital. Calculated at today's thirty-six chō per ri, it amounts to forty-six and a half ri.

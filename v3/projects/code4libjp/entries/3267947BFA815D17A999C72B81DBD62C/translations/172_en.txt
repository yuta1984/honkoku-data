○Komatsuhara (Small Pine Fields) ●Located in Atsumi District
　　　　●"Aki no Nezame" states that Komatsugahara has poems in "Fuboku," located in Ōmi Province ●Upon examination, in Keichū's
　　"Hoyoku-shō" as well - Shōan period ♪"Drawing together the same green twin leaves, plucking young leaves at Komatsugahara,"
　　Ōmi Province - though this is cited, the two poems presented here are from "Mikawa Province Famous Places Poetry Contest," so they certainly
　　were composed about our province. According to Keio's examination, the poem beginning with "midori naru" is included in "Fuboku" volume 22 following these two poems. The preface states
　　　　　　　　　　"Shōan Great Harvest Festival place names by Minister of Treasury Takanobu," so it must have been composed about Ōmi Province
　●"Fuboku" (Vol. 22, Miscellaneous 4) Tametada Ason's Mikawa Province Famous Places Poetry Contest, Komatsuhara (also in Ōmi or Bitchū) Kiyosuke Ason
　　　The small pine field visible far into the future - an example of your thousand years (external)
　●Same (same) Fujiwara no Michikata
　　　The small pine field that has grown since the age of gods - no one knows how many thousand years have passed (external)

○Chirifu (Pond Carp Crucian) ●"Mikawa Moshio-gusa" states it is in Hekikai District; "Wamyō-shō" lists it as Chiriyū,
　　　　　●"Segen Ben'ryaku" (Vol. 2, 23rd page) states: Because there are many carp and crucian carp in the sacred pond of Chiriyū Shrine, in the
　　　　　　middle ages it was rewritten as Chirifu (Pond Carp Crucian)
　●"Kōyō-shū" (5) Staying at a place called Chirifu - Lord Karasumaru Mitsuhiro
　　　I shall rely on the shadow of words - using the pine root as pillow that does not scatter away, though only for one night (white also)
　　　　Upon examination, the "u" in "chiriu" should probably be "fu" - this is incorrect
　●"Shun'sho" At Chirifu, seeing carp among the side dishes
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Same author
　　　Living up to this village's name - pond carp and crucian prepared as side dishes
　○"Kikō" Same author (or anonymous?)
　　　In this village where even carp and crucian live purely - how joyful to meet in this pure water's heart (white also)

(Anzen states in "Hoyoku-shō")
　　Komatsuhara Ōmi Province
(Shōan period "Drawing together the same green twin leaves, plucking young vegetables at Komatsugahara" - though it says Komatsuhara, below it says Ōmi Province. Also incidentally states: In "Meisho Gai-shū" Nagatō Hill - not yet determined Jōtoku 2nd year, first month, night of kanoe-saru, impromptu poetry contest on famous places)
("Fuboku" 21 Fujiwara no Saneki "Celebrating the first day of the year at Nagatō's small pine field, your ten thousand generations will continue endlessly" - upon examination, this Jōtoku 2nd year reference might be from the same time as Tametada Ason's Mikawa Province Famous Places Poetry Contest, because Tametada Ason died in Hōen 2nd year, and this Jōtoku 2nd year was only about thirty-nine years apart, not so distant. However, this is merely tentative speculation. Please consider this matter more carefully.)

"May people also pull the iris grass of Mikawa Pond that grows anew this year, as a long-lasting example"
　　　　This poem appears in "Matsuba-shū" volume 13, listed as "Mikawa Pond Ise Moshio." ●Also in "Zoku Senzai-shū" in the congratulatory section, a poem by the Former Kyōgoku Minister expressing court sentiments: "The autumn shadows of a thousand years are reflected in the Mikawa water beneath the flowers of the bush clover gate." According to "Moshiogusa," this is not about a famous place in Mikawa but is a court poem. Also in the preface to "Kokin-shū" spring volume:
　　　　"Composed upon seeing cherry blossoms scattering and flowing in the imperial channel water at the Crown Prince's elegant residence"
●From "Yakumo Gyoshō" which states "Mikawa water (usually refers to the imperial palace channels) is in front of the central hall," etc., 
　　　　we should understand that this does not refer to Mikawa but to the imperial palace channels.
　　　●In "Moshiogusa": "Mikawa water, how many autumns have you reflected our lord, Mikawa water, the eternal starry shadows in the clouds above" - this mostly refers to the palace channels, in front of the central hall. Also "Yakumo Gyoshō" states it is not limited to the imperial court, etc. ●The same book mentions "Mikawa Pond Ise."

○Mount Mayumi　　●According to "Mikawa Moshiogusa," it is located in Busetsu village in Shitara District.
　　　　　　　●According to "Futaba-matsu," it is a mountain parallel to Mount Ikoma in Busetsu village.
　○　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Prince Yoshiyuki
　　　Gazing at the gradually brightening sky at dawn, the moon alone dwells in the western mountain's shadow
　　　●According to "Mikawa Moshiogusa," when Prince Yoshiyuki of the Yoshino Palace, pressed by the Ashikaga family,
　　　　was traveling to Nitta in Kōzuke Province, he entered Busetsu village in Mikawa Province and
　　　　composed this while viewing the moon over Mount Mayumi.
　　　●Upon examination, Prince Yuranaga was the son of Prince Munenaga, who was a son of Emperor Go-Daigo. On August 15th of Ōei 31 (1424), he committed suicide at Ōkawahara in Shinano Province, as recorded in "Namiai-ki" and "Fujishima Shiki."
　●"Horikawa Hyakushu" volume 2, mountains, Yūshi Naishinnō's lady-in-waiting Kii: "Do friends who think to gather in a circle enter the mayumi mountain in autumn?" This poem is attributed to Shimotsuke Province in "Aki no Nezame" and other works.

[Right margin note]
According to "Tōsō-kō," while various records mention offering water from Hoshino Pond as imperial hair-washing water morning and evening, none specify which emperor, which is puzzling. Considering Emperor Jitō's imperial progress to Miyaji-yama and Hikuma-no, perhaps this famous water was offered morning and evening to that temporary palace. Since it would be quite close to that temporary palace, this seems plausible.

One should also consult the section on Hōi District in "Mikawa Kashū."

There is nothing else but to collect and examine them, etc. Now, there is also something called "Sōkoku Fudoki" (General Provincial Gazetteer). This consists entirely of fragmentary and incomplete volumes, but among them only that of Suruga Province is mostly complete, though it too has gaps due to insect damage and such. Now, these records have already fallen into disuse in the world, and even the little that remains in fragments has been damaged by insect holes and other causes, rendering them incomplete. The oldest versions include a copy with a postscript written by Nakahara no Morotsune during the Bunwa era (1352-1356), followed by copies with postscripts by various individuals during the Kakei, Bunki, Kōji, and Tenshō eras. There are also copies made during the Kanbun-Manji period (1661-1673) that lack the old postscripts. Now, while these books contain many erroneous and missing characters, they constitute historical records nonetheless. The severely corrupted passages were likely caused by copying errors in later times. When this General Provincial Gazetteer was compiled cannot be determined. It appears to be much later than the ancient fudoki discussed above. If we must conjecture, it seems likely to have been commissioned during the reign of Emperor Go-Sanjō (1068-1073), for which there is

evidence. This is because works such as Hyakurenshō, Gukanshō, and Zoku Kojidan record that "the Emperor halted the establishment of novel private estates in various provinces and for the first time established the Records Office and the Private Estate Document Office, thereby correcting the decline of the provinces." Considering this together, one can surmise that with deep imperial concern, edicts were quickly issued to the various provinces calling for fudoki, but since precedents for compilation were not yet established, draft-like documents were submitted from here and there to the Records Office. However, before all provinces had finished their submissions, the Emperor passed away, and the entire system of governance changed, so the matter of these records was abandoned and they remain buried in the official archives. Now, this fudoki was collected and compiled by Imai Jikan in his Man'yōshū-i in fourteen volumes. Along with this, I myself have now collected records from about twenty-seven provinces, gathering material from this province and that county. However, the format of this fudoki is vastly different from the ancient ones, and the writing is crude and inferior, clearly being from a later period, which raises questions about

　　In the evening mist of Takashi Bay with offshore winds, where might Hamana Bridge be visible?
●Same (Volume 23, Miscellaneous 5) From winter poems　　Tsuchimikado-in no Shōsaishō
　　At Hamana River, with the incoming tide and cold mountain winds, the interior of Takashi grows even more desolate (Ho)
○Nayose　　　　　　　　　　　　Gojō-naidafu
　　At Takashi Mountain, magpies perching in the pines at evening - the moon appears to cross over the base of their bridge (Ho)
　　●This poem appears in Matsuba-shū as Nayose, attributed to Gokujō-naidaijin, and in Ruijū as Motoka,
　　　it is said, but it does not appear in the Utamakura Nayose, so this should be investigated,
thus it is known,
Those that clearly refer to Tōtōmi Province are:
●Fuboku (Volume 20, Miscellaneous 2) Takashi Mountain (Takashi, Tōtōmi)　　Anonymous
●Rokujō (Volume 2)
　　Meeting is like Takashi Mountain in distant Tōtōmi - how high the burning thoughts in my heart (Ho)
These are the only ones. Thus, considering the ancient books and old poems cited in the above sections,
originally this name came from the mountain in this province [Mikawa], and later it was applied to include even the mountain in Tōtōmi,
and thus it became a great name spanning the mountains of both provinces.
　　Similarly, Mount Kiso is now exclusively called the mountain in Shinano, but in the Shoku Nihon-ki, Volume 2, in the entry for the 12th month of Taihō 2nd year, it states "first opened the Kiso road of Mino Province," showing that originally it was a great name spanning the mountains of both provinces. Also, that it originally came from the name of Mikawa Province can be discerned from the fact that in the Wamyō-shō and other ancient books, there are many examples referring to Mikawa, while those referring to Tōtōmi are extremely rare.

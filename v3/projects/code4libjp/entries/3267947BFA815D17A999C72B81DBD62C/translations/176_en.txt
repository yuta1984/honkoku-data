　　built and they claim it is the old site - this is suspicious
　●Haku says it is Yamanaka Hōzōji Temple. Ideumarudera was originally of the Hossō sect, but in the second year of Meitoku under Emperor Go-Komatsu, through Master Ryūgei of Kyoto's Enpukuji Temple, it became Jōdo sect and was renamed Hōzōji Temple, as seen in the temple records.

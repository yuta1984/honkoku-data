When [the documents] arrive, carry out the administration, it states. The intent of this official directive is that the various provinces should have drafts of the fudoki (provincial gazetteers) previously submitted, and this time they should review these and resubmit them. If these do not exist, they should search within the counties, question the elderly, and compile new records to submit. Many provinces likely responded to this official directive by reviewing and resubmitting drafts of previously submitted fudoki. There were probably also those who newly investigated the old accounts of elders and submitted them. According to the Honchō Shojaku Mokuroku (Catalog of Japanese Books), fudoki are recorded as "various local origins," so considering the overall intent of ancient fudoki, they were primarily records of accounts passed down by elders in each province from ancient times, serving as valuable evidence for ancient matters, making them extremely precious and valuable texts. However, many of the original ancient fudoki have been lost, with only those of four provinces remaining: Izumo, Hitachi, Hizen, and Bungo. Among these, the fudoki submitted during the Wadō era that survive to the present day are

only Hitachi, which should be considered one volume among them. This is clear because it begins with "The Hitachi provincial governor reports on matters of old accounts passed down by elders. When questioning about the old affairs of provinces and counties, the elders together said..." This is clearly text that follows the Wadō imperial edict. The fact that it records "villages" (sato) under "counties" (gun) also seems to be reliable evidence. The Izumo fudoki states "investigated and confirmed on the 30th day of the 2nd month of Tenpyō 5," so it was submitted about twenty years after Wadō 6. This was likely a record that was re-examined and resubmitted for some reason after being initially submitted according to the Wadō edict. The Hizen and Bungo fudoki have generally the same format as Izumo's, so they were probably submitted around the same time. Though the style of writing appears later than Izumo's, there is evidence that these were records existing from before the Enchō era. Have all the others been completely lost? They have not yet appeared in the world. Beginning with Senkaku's citations in the Man'yōshū Commentary and the Shaku Nihongi, various other ancient books have also cited them here and there.

are also not recorded, so there is nothing to consider regarding what kind of person this was.

●Elder Kamo's "Man'yō-kō" volume 1, folio 12 also approves of the left annotation's theory, saying: "Moreover, thinking that Irago Cape belongs to Ise Province or Shima Province is also an error. Though it is a later work, 'Kokon Chomon-jū' states that there is also a place called Irago in Iyo Province. There should also be places with the same name in Inaba." ●"Man'yō Ryakkai" volume 1, folio 23 also follows this theory.

●Keichū's "Man'yō Daishō-ki" volume 1, part 2 states: "Doubts remain about this annotation. Indeed, the Nihon Shoki is as quoted here, but one should not compose 'harvesting seaweed' without reason. Perhaps initially he was sent into exile to Ise Province, but was later transferred to Inaba, and the Nihon Shoki recorded the later version. Regarding the offering of sacred garments to the Grand Shrine of Ise, members of the Omi and Hatori clans were in that province, and perhaps due to the name Prince Omi, though it was Inaba, it was called Irago Island."

●"Mikawa Moshio-gusa" also states: "The claim of exile to Irago Island - was this a mistaken record by later people based on song lyrics, or was he transferred to Irago Island after being exiled to Inaba?"

●Now, this poem is also recorded in "Fuboku-shū" volume 23, Miscellaneous 5, with unknown title: "Wet by waves, harvesting seaweed of Irago Island."

●Haku states: "This poem, in present-day Irago, is chanted as 'Beating hemp, the noble lord, are you now a fisherman? Harvesting seaweed at Irago beach,' and is said to be transmitted as the composition of Lord Karasumaru."

●Upon consideration, "Lord Karasumaru" is probably a mistaken transmission of Prince Omi. Details are given in "Kansha Shikō," lower volume, under Iraku Shrine.

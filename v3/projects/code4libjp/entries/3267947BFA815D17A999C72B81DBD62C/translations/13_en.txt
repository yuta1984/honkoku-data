○were abolished, and the provincial-county system was adopted, with administrative centers established in each province, and provincial governors (kokushi) and district governors (gunji) appointed to govern them. This is stated following the ideas from Hirata Atsutane's "Koshi-chō Kaidaiki."
○Until this time, as had existed since ancient times, divine affairs and national government were unified, so at court the great ministers (ōomi) and great muraji (ōmuraji) and others served concurrently in charge of divine affairs, and in each province the provincial governors (kuni no miyatsuko) held divine affairs as their superior responsibility. From the time of this imperial system, the court established a separate Department of Worship (Jingikan) and had its officials handle divine affairs, while in each province, as the provincial governors came down from the capital and provincial administration came under their jurisdiction, the divine affairs of the provinces remained under the management of the traditional provincial governors as before. This matter appears in various texts and is as stated in the general purport of the first volume of "Kansha Shikō."
○Thus, in the provinces the four ranks of kami (governor), suke (assistant governor), jō (secretary), and sakan (clerk) were established, and in the districts the four ranks of dairyō (head district governor), shōryō (assistant district governor), shusei (administrator), and shuchō (recorder) were established. {{Note: Gunji (district governors) is the collective term for these four ranks of district administrators.}}
○In the "Chronicle of Emperor Kōtoku," in the edict of the eighth month of Taika 2, it states: "Village chiefs, omi, muraji, tomo no miyatsuko, and people of various clans, all

should listen and hear. The manner in which we now have you serve is to reform and abandon the old offices, newly establish one hundred offices, and also assign court ranks, conferring them according to official position," and so forth. It also states: "Abolishing the populations of imperial estates (koshiro) established by emperors of old, granaries (miyake) in various places, and the hereditary groups (kakibe) owned by omi, muraji, tomo no miyatsuko, kuni no miyatsuko, and village chiefs, as well as agricultural estates (tadokoro) in various places, we grant sustenance fiefs (heito)."
○In the "Shokuin-ryō" (Administrative Code): "One governor (kami). He oversees shrines and temples, population registers and record books, nurtures the people, encourages agriculture and sericulture, investigates his jurisdiction, handles tribute recommendations, matters of filial piety and righteousness, lawsuits concerning fields and residences and free and slave status, land tax and tribute, granaries, corvée labor, soldiers, weapons, musical instruments, postal stations, relay horses, beacon fires, castle pastures, travel passes, public and private cattle and horses, miscellaneous lost items, and the name registers of monks and nuns at temples.
In the Shrine Interpretation (Shisha Gige): 'Shrine worship (shi) means worshipping the hundred deities. Shrine (sha) means inspecting and supervising various shrines. All references to shrines and worship follow this precedent.'
One assistant governor (suke). Duties same as the governor. One senior secretary (ōjō). Oversees investigating and judging within the province, examining and signing documents, checking for errors, and investigating misconduct. One junior secretary (shōjō). Duties same as the senior secretary. One senior clerk (ōsakan). Oversees receiving matters, submitting reports, examining and signing documents, detecting errors, and reading and reporting official documents. One junior clerk (shōsakan). Duties same as the senior clerk. Three scribes (fubito).
○In the "Chronicle of Emperor Kōnin," in the third month of Hōki 6, senior and junior clerk positions were first established in Mikawa Province.

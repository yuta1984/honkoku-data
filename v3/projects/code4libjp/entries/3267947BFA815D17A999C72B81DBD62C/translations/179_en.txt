　　　Leaving the dew-laden lodging of a grass pillow, the night sky over Akasaka grows faintly bright

　　　The village I heard called Akasaka is clothed in autumn leaves - could this be why the name shines with evening sun

　　　　　　On the ninth day, departing from Yahashi, we passed through Akasaka post station. Long ago at this post station, there was a courtesan with a flower-like face,
　　　　　　graceful as spring, with an orchid-like refinement fragrant as autumn. Borrowing beauty from Pan Anren's
　　　　　　siblings, she formed a bond as wife and concubine to an official of Mikawa Province. The concubine
　　　　　　preceded her husband in leaving this world early, and the husband, left behind by his concubine, departed from home. Perhaps it was the manifestation of a beneficent bodhisattva
　　　　　　that guided the husband, or perhaps Enton Daishi's awakening of the religious spirit saved the concubine -
　　　　　　their mutual good spiritual friendship was a great karmic connection. The evil
　　　　　　resentment from his former wife's jealous curses transformed into the courtesy of good teaching, and from the morning mockery and contempt in foreign lands, his nose ran as he begged for alms, but suddenly
　　　　　　through the virtue of wisdom and practice he gained fame in Tang China and left honor in our country. The holy man is truly
　　　　　　precious. Who would say he was a saint who entered the path of initial awakening? This is indeed the original Buddha
　　　　　　appearing in the world to transform people. Walking along, speaking of the past, we still feel
　　　　　　compassion for the present.

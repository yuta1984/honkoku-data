　　　The white waves that can be inserted as hairpins for the sea god delay at Okitsushima Mountain

　　　●According to "Mikawa Moshiogusa," this poem is included in the miscellaneous section (volume 17) of the Kokin-shū, and the style of the poem is quite similar. Perhaps it was written incorrectly? However, since it has been transmitted in writing this way for many years, I record it as is.
　　　●According to "Ushikubo Mitsudan-ki," in "Shibaya Kikō" it states: "Passing through Udono Saburō's lodging during the day from Nishi district, there was yuzuke (rice with hot tea). Stayed one day at Makino Heizaburō's house in a place called Ina. There was also a poetry gathering: 'Deutzia flowers—waves delay at Okitsu Island.' Sōchō: 'Using the name of this Kijōjima, later: "White waves that can be inserted as hairpins for the sea god shake Awaji Island Mountain" by Sōchō.'"


○Mitsu (Harbor)　　●According to "Wamyō-shō," Mitsu in Hōi District refers to present-day Hiroishi village in Mitsu Manor.
　　　　　　The official shrine, Mitsu Shrine, is also located in this place.
　●According to "Mikawa Moshiogusa," at the southwestern foot of Mount Mitsu, there is a stone pavement of rocks. In ancient times there was a detached shrine here; it is now the back mountain of Daion-ji temple. ●Upon examination, it is located to the southwest of Mount Mitsu, within the territory of Nagino village, where there is a natural cave-like stone formation with a small shrine. It is called the Stone Pavement Aragami (fierce deity). It offers an excellent view overlooking the sea below.

　　　Great island, eternal pine grove, stone pavement—even if it crumbles away, I shall protect it
　　　●"Mikawa Moshiogusa" says this poem is traditionally said to be a divine poem by the great deity.
　　　●"Tōkaidō Meisho Zue" also states the same.

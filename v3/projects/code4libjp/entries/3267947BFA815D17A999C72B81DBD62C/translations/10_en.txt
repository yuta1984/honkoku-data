○This book (the Hitachi-no-kuni Fudoki) was compiled by Minamoto no Shitagō, Junior Fifth Rank Upper Grade and Governor of Noto Province, under the command of Imperial Princess Kinshi, the fourth daughter of Emperor Daigo. Minamoto no Shitagō died at the age of seventy-two in the first year of Eikan (983). This is stated in the Dai Nihon-shi 《Volume 218, Literature 5》, citing the Kasen-den (Biographies of Poet Sages) and genealogies. From the first year of Eikan to this year, Tenpō 10, it has been 856 years.

○When comparing the district names in this book with those in the Engi-shiki 《Volume 22, Ministry of Popular Affairs》, they largely correspond.

○According to Ban Nobutomo's theory, the village names recorded in the Wamyō-shō were compiled by ordering various provinces to officially report them, similar to ancient provincial gazetteers, recording exactly what the people of each province traditionally pronounced. Therefore, the usage of phonetic characters (kana) for pronunciation guides varies greatly and is generally difficult for most people to understand. Some place names written in kana have pronunciation guides attached, while other difficult-to-read place names lack pronunciation guides.

There are various types: some retain ancient pronunciations as they were, some have been commonly used since ancient times, some have become current through later phonetic changes, some have become corrupted through euphonic changes, some have abbreviated words, some have changed names, some have incorrect readings, some are pronounced with Chinese readings, some should originally be pronounced with Chinese readings, some are Korean words, some differ from ancient kana usage, etc. This diversity exists because they recorded exactly how people in each province pronounced them.

○Now, in the Izumo-no-kuni Fudoki 《Upper section, second page》, it states: "The character for 'gō' (village) was changed from 'ri' to 'gō' according to the regulations of the first year of Reiki." Beginning with recording all place names in that gazetteer as 'gō', not only the ancient Hizen and Bungo provincial gazetteers, but also later provincial gazetteers from various countries all recorded them as 'gō'. Therefore, based on this precedent, I title this work "District and Village Investigation" (Gun-gō-kō).

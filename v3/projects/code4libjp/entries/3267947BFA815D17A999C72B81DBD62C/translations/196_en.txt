○Shinozuka　Located in Hōi District　●Keichū's "Ruiji Meisho Waka-shū" volume 2 lists it as a famous place in this province　●"Aki no Nezame" places it in Mutsu Province
　　　　　　●"Wamyō-shō" Hōi District, Shinozuka Village　●"Sōgoku Fudoki" contains Shinozuka Village

●According to "Yamato Monogatari" (volume 1, page 20), when Tadafumi became a general of Mutsu and went down there, a woman called Kan no Myōbu secretly loved his son. [Omitted] When this man went down to Mutsu Province, he sent touching letters, but when she heard that he had fallen ill and died on the journey, the woman felt great sorrow. Later, from a place called Shinozuka Station, someone brought a letter containing touching sentiments sent through a messenger. Feeling very sad, when she asked when this was written, she was told that the messenger had taken an extremely long time to bring it. The woman composed:
　At Shinozuka Station, you who waited impatiently have died in vain
and wept. A person who had served at court as a page called Daishichi came of age and worked at the Kurōdo-dokoro, serving as a gold messenger accompanying his father.

○Yanase River　●"Mikawa Sōgoku Fudoki" states that following Yana District and Yana Manor, Yanase River produces fresh fish, mulberry, and willow. The exact location is unclear and requires further investigation.
　　　　　　●"Ruiji Meisho Waka-shū" (volume 5) lists Gyorayose River as location unknown

●"Kokin Rokujō" (volume 3)
　Hearing that this is an age where the shallows of Yanase River shift unpredictably, I too place deep trust in it
　●Upon examination, this poem is listed as "details unknown" in "Aki no Nezame" and other sources.

　　　Even if it were a dream, it would be fine if it were Yoshida village; awakening to reality, the painful journey continues
　●"Kōyō-shū" (Volume 5)　　At a place called Yoshida　　　Minister Karasumaru Mitsuhiro
　　　I think of it fondly—today is the divine festival in the capital, hearing that this place too is called Yoshida village
　○"Musashino-gusa"
　　　Thinking of the capital, it feels so distant; my walking stick has grown weary reaching this Yoshida of the same name

　　　●Upon examination, in the "Shūi-shū" kagura songs, there is "Since it is a staff of Yoshida village famous in name, even if it strikes, it will not wear out for your myriad generations." ●According to "Shōchi Tokai-hen," this song is a folk song from the Daijōsai ceremony of Tenroku 1, referring to Yoshida in Ōmi Province. ●The same book states that all other songs referring to Yoshida village or hamlet are about Ōmi. None have been found that compose about villages in Yoshida of Yamashiro. All that compose about forests or fields—everything concerning shrines—refer to Yamashiro.

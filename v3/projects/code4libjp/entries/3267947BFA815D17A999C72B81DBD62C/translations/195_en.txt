○Mount Ikoma　According to "Mikawa Moshio-gusa," it is a high mountain in the mountain range located in Ushiji Village, about six ri northeast of Asuke in Kamo District. It is commonly called Koma-yama.

According to "Mikawa Suzume," this refers to the temple placard of Entsuzan Ikuma-ji temple in Ushiji Village and Ikuma-yama of Saruhiki. Could this be what is meant by the famous Mount Ikoma?  According to "Sanpo Matsu," it is northeast of Asuke and is also called Shitara District.

○　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Anonymous poet
Saying "just for a while" and stopping at Mikawa Ikoma-yama, shall I go beyond, on the distant eastern road?

"Shinchokusen-shu" (Volume 19, Miscellaneous 4)　When composing a hundred-poem sequence　Former Grand Minister and Regent Gokyo-goku
The Ikoma-yama that appeared in the distant clouds turned out to be at the foot of spring haze.

Upon examination, the Ikoma-yama sung in ancient poems, as noted in "Yakumo Gyosho" (Volume 5, page 3) as "Ikoma-yama (near Yamato and Kawachi provinces, or a famous place in both provinces)," is located in Yamato or Kawachi, and not all references are to the one in Mikawa. This is evident from the following:

"Man'yoshu" (Volume 20): Rowing out from Naniwa harbor, I crossed the divine Ikoma mountain to come here
"Fuboku-shu": The cuckoo has moved to Takayasu, calling as it crosses Ikoma mountain  
"Nayose": People of Naniwa will look back to see the first cherry blossoms of Ikoma's high peak in their old village

These refer to Kawachi Province. There are also poems in Man'yoshu volumes 10, 15, 20, etc.

"Shinkokin-shu": Is it raining in Akishino or in the village of Toyama? Clouds hang over Mount Ikoma
"Gyokuyoshu": Mount Ikoma where the morning sun shines appears clearly, with mist rising from Akishino village

These likely refer to locations in Yamato.

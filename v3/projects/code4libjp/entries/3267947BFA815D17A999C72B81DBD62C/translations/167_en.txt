●This section on the study of Mount Takashi dates to around the 11th month of Tenpō 4 (1833), when someone from Tōtōmi, having heard through others about my draft considerations, wrote saying: "While it is very clear that the mountain is within Tōtōmi Province, your assertion that it is within this province [Mikawa] is very questionable - I would very much like to see your scholarly writings on this." So, though it was still an incomplete and humble consideration, I took out that draft, reconsidered it, and sent it over there. Therefore, though the format differs from other sections and may seem awkward, since rewriting would be an extremely troublesome task, I include it here as is.

Furthermore, ancient poems that sing of Mount Takashi are:
●Shin-Chokusen-shū (Volume 5, Late Autumn)　　　Kamakura Udaijin
　With clouds settling on distant treetops shrouded in mist, deer cry on Mount Takashi (Name)
●Shin-Senzai-shū (Volume 8, Travel) Composed at Mount Takashi when traveling east　Hōgen Gyōsai
　Mount Takashi, which I could not cross, does not clear at dawn - horizontal clouds above the mist-covered peaks
●Shin-Zoku-Kokin-shū (Volume 10, Travel) From the hundred-poem sequence offered in Jōwa 2nd year　Former Chūnagon Masataka
　The day does not end and sunlight still lingers on Mount Takashi - shall I pass by the lodging I had in mind?
●Fuboku-shū (Volume 4, Late Spring) Personal collection, "Mooring and Seeking Flowers"　Saigyō Shōnin
　Rowing out and gazing toward the offing of Takashi, not even a single cluster of white clouds blooms

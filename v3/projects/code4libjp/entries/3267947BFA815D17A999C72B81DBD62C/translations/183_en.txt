○Goyu　　●Located in Hoi District, now within Hachiman Village, the area called Kamijuku is said to be the old post station.
　　　　　●According to "Mikawa Suzume," there are three Goi (Five Wells) in Mikawa - upper, middle, and lower - and oil tribute was offered to the Imperial Court from the middle Goi. About 250 years ago it was renamed Goyu, and water from Hoshino's pond was offered to the Imperial Court as御鬢水 (water for the imperial coiffure) together with oil from Goyu, it is said. ●"Segen Benryaku" volume 2, folio 24 states that it was originally written as Goi, with three villages of the same name, this place being the middle Goi. Oil merchants from this location provided lamp oil for Prince Kusakabe's temporary palace, which later became the station name.

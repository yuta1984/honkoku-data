●Meisho Zue states: It refers to the area continuing from Shirasuka to Kitayama (place name). Another theory says that Takashi Mountain refers to the mountain continuing from the present Tenjin shrine to Shirasuka. The view over the sea is a magnificent sight during travel.

　　　●In my opinion, Takashi Mountain originally derives its name from mountains in this province, and would be a general name encompassing the mountains from the vicinity of present-day Takashi
　　　　Village in Atsumi District, through Hiuchi Slope, Taimatsu Pass, Shiomi Slope, and continuing northeast to
　　　　the mountains of Tōtōmi Province. The evidence that this is primarily from our province is found in Minamoto no Shitagō's,
　●Wamyō-shō: In the section on Atsumi District of this province, there is Takashi Village, and also
　●Daijingū Shinpō-shō mentions Takashi mikuriya of Mikawa Province, and
　●Dōkyū Kenkyū nenjū gyōji (vol. 2, folio 70) mentions Takashi mikuriya of Mikawa Province. (The full text is quoted and explained in detail in Kōbe-kō)
　　　　Even today there is a village called Takashi, and the general name for the low mountains extending two to three ri around that area is called
　　　　Takashi Mountain, and the villages in that vicinity - Akazawa, Ikobe, Takatsuka, Nanane, Terazawa, Kojima, Hosoya,
　　　　Ōiwa, Futagawa, and from there to the areas of Shirasuka and Nagatani in Tōtōmi Province - are all called Takashi-no-shō.
　●In the daughter of Sugawara no Takasue's Sarashina Nikki, it states: "Going further up, we climbed the indescribably desolate slope called Inohana, and reached what is called Takashi-no-hama in Mikawa Province."
　●Priest Masumoto, in his Tōtōmi-dō no Ki, hearing that pottery was made at Takashi Mountain, composed:
　　〽"Not ordinary - at Takashi Mountain's pottery making, I hear they fire thoughts of love"
　　This refers to how even today, in areas within Takashi Mountain - between Ōtsu Village and Ueta Village at a place with the character name Daizen,
　　and at a place in the mountains of Ōsaki Village with the character name Hiroshima - many fragments of unglazed pottery
　　are dug up, showing that pottery was made there.
　○In the personal collection of Lord Fujiwara no Masatsune, at a place called Hiuchi Slope, regarding hiding shoes, there was
　　such a person among the common people, which he heard about at the end of a poem and composed based on it:
　　　〽"Stone corners of Takashi Mountain - this must be it, at Hiuchi Slope where shoes are hidden"

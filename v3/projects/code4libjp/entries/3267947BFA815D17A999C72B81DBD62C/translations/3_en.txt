"face" and so on. (The Kojiki, middle volume, folio 59, in the section on the same emperor states: "Therefore, Takeuchi no Sukune was made great minister, and the provincial governors of large and small provinces were appointed, and the boundaries of various provinces as well as the district chiefs of large and small districts were established.")

This represents the first instance where the establishment of territorial boundaries in human society can be observed.

Thereafter, provincial scribes were appointed in various provinces to record words and events and compile regional chronicles, as seen in the Nihon Shoki (volume 12, folio 6) in the section on Emperor Richū's fourth year, eighth month of autumn. It is recorded that boundary markers for provinces were constructed during Emperor Ingyō's reign, as noted in the Shinsen Shōjiroku (upper volume, folio 38) in the section on Sakaibe no Muraji.

In the second year of Taika under Emperor Kōtoku, an edict was issued stating: "The boundaries of various provinces should be inspected, some recorded in documents, and some drawn in maps to be brought and presented. The names of provinces and districts will be determined when the time comes."

Furthermore, in the twelfth year of Emperor Tenmu, Prince Ise and others were dispatched to tour the realm and establish boundaries between provinces. However, the demarcation could not be completed that year, so in the thirteenth year, Prince Ise and others were again sent to establish provincial boundaries, as recorded in the Nihon Shoki (volume 25, folio 22; volume 29, folio 35).

Also, in the tenth year of Tenpyō under Emperor Shōmu, all provinces throughout the realm were ordered to

create maps of their provinces and districts and submit them, as recorded in the Shoku Nihongi (volume 13, folio 6).

○ As for the ancient divisions of provinces that can be observed, the Kojiki (middle volume, page 28, section on Emperor Sujin) mentions "Koshi-dō" (referring to the later Hokuriku-dō), and the same work (middle volume, folio 28, same emperor's section) refers to "twelve eastern routes" (referring to the Tōkai-dō; twelve indicates the number of provinces). The Nihon Shoki (volume 5, folio 6, same emperor's section) mentions "Hokurikudō, Tōkaidō, and Nishi-dō" (referring to San'yōdō), as well as "four routes" (Hokurikudō, Tōkaidō, Nishi-dō, and Tanba), and also (volume 7, folio 23, section on Emperor Keikō) "fifteen provinces of Tōsandō."

The imperial volume on Emperor Kōtoku (volume 25, folio 9) shows the establishment of the Kinai, and the imperial volume on Empress Jitō (volume 30, folio 22) mentions "four Kinai provinces" (at this time, Kawachi and Izumi were still one province). In the imperial chronicle of Emperor Tenmu (volume 29, folio 42), six routes are mentioned together: "San'yōdō, San'indō, also Tōkaidō, Tōsandō, San'yōdō, San'indō, Nankaidō, and Tsukushi." The name "seven routes" first appears in the Shoku Nihongi (volume 2, folio 5, section on Emperor Monmu).

As for the total number of all provinces, no ancient records specify an exact count. The Kokuzō Honki in the Kuji Honki (volume 10) lists one hundred and forty-four.

　　　　　　　　128　Omei-kō (Oe-shiki)　(13th day)
　Our founding master, Saint Nichiren, passed away at Ikegami on October 13th of Kōan 5. Since this day corresponds to his death anniversary, Oe-shiki ceremonies are held at Myōen-ji Temple in Shimizu-chō and other Hokke sect temples.
　　　　　　　　129　Kannamesai Festival　(17th day)
　This is the ceremony where His Majesty offers the year's first rice harvest to the Great Shrine of Ise, conducted at both the Imperial Palace and Ise Shrine.
This festival began with the autumn Kannamesai established during Emperor Monmu's reign simultaneously with the Taihō Code, and was traditionally called the Ise Regular Festival, held annually on September 17th. After the Meiji period, it was established as it is today. Imperial envoys are also dispatched to Ise Shrine, which became customary after Emperor Genshō sent an envoy to offer sacred offerings on September 11th of Yōrō 5.
　　　　　　　　130　Ebisu-kō　(20th day)　Old Calendar
　This is a ritual to worship Ebisu deity. In the past, it was held on January 10th (20th in Edo) and October 20th. January celebrates prosperity in business throughout the year, while October is performed as thanksgiving for this.
On this night, merchant houses offer sacred food and sake along with sea bream to images of the fortune deity Ebisu, and hold banquets inviting valued customers and relatives. Children would walk around to merchant houses to receive mandarin oranges and sweets. Not limited to merchant houses, people make vinegared dishes and offer sake and sea bream at household shrines in celebration.
In this region, unmarried people do not eat the food offered to Ebisu-sama, believing it would delay their marriage prospects.

　　　　　　　　131　Otori-koshi　(22nd day)
　The death anniversary of Shinran, founder of Jōdo Shinshū, is in November, but since sect followers become busy during that month, the memorial service is held one month earlier.
　　　　　　　　132　Shōkon Festival　(23rd and 24th days)
　The local Shōkon Festival is grandly held at the festival grounds set up at the 18th Infantry Regiment parade ground on the day of Yasukuni Shrine's autumn grand festival. This is jointly sponsored by the Third Division and Aichi Prefecture Loyal Service Association, honoring and mourning the loyal souls of local war dead who sacrificed themselves for emperor and country in various military campaigns. On this day, all their bereaved families are invited, and after military worship concludes, general public worship is permitted. With horse racing, bicycle races, and various other entertainments, it draws crowds not only from the city but also from nearby areas, making it a citywide lively festival. This festival was reduced to one day with the abolition of the 15th Division in Taishō 14, but from Shōwa 6, it returned to being held over two days.
　　　　　　　　133　Inoko　(Second Day of the Boar)　Old Calendar
　This event is said to have begun during Emperor Uda's Kanpyō era. Since October is the month of the boar, eating rice cakes on a boar day at the hour of the boar in this month is said to prevent all diseases. The first boar day of this month is called "ichiban inoko," the next "niban inoko," and if there's a third, "sanban inoko." Common households make and eat botamochi on the second boar day. It's said that common people observe the second boar day out of deference, since the castle lord celebrated on the first boar day.

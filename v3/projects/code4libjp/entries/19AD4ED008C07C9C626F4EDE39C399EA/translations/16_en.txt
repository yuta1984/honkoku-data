　　　　　　　　　52　Hatsuma (First Horse Day)　(First horse day)　Old custom
　Worshipping Inari gods on the first horse day of February is said to originate from when the Imperial Shrine Fushimi Inari Taisha in Kyoto was enshrined at that location on February 9th of Wadō 4 during Empress Genmei's reign, which happened to be the first horse day of February.
On this day, festivals are held wherever there are Inari shrines, and were quite popular in the past. On this day, red rice was steamed and formed into spindle shapes to give to children or offer to Inari deities. Children would write "Shōichi-i Inari Daimyōjin" on five-colored paper or red cotton and offer it so their writing would improve.
　On this day at Sakurashita Inari in Asahi-chō, lanterns were hung along the roadside and there were kagura performances and puppet theater, making it quite lively. Households keeping cattle and horses would visit Komatsuhara Kannon-ji temple on horse days of this month to obtain ema votive tablets and bamboo grass, hanging them at stable entrances as protection against evil. Originally only the second horse day was observed. Many people also visit Toyokawa Inari on this day.

　　　　　　　　　53　Kigensetsu (National Foundation Day)　(11th day)　Plus, Kenkoku-sai
【Left page】
　This is a national holiday to commemorate the day Emperor Jinmu held his enthronement ceremony at Kashihara Palace in Yamato Province. It began on January 29, Meiji 5, but was established as today's date in Meiji 7 when converted to the solar calendar. On this day there is an imperial ceremony at the palace, and domestic and foreign envoys are summoned to receive imperial banquets.
　In recent years, celebrating this day as "Kenkoku-sai" (National Foundation Festival) has become popular, and indeed in our locality too, after the congratulatory ceremony, various events are held under municipal sponsorship at the bronze statue of Emperor Jinmu in the 18th Infantry Regiment training grounds.
　　　　　　　　　54　Oni Matsuri (Demon Festival)　(14th, 15th)
　Originally a Shinto ritual of Shinmei Shrine, a prefectural shrine in Nakahachi-chō, performed on January 13th and 14th. A tengu-masked figure called Hanadaka, wearing a samurai cap and armored, wields a naginata halberd to fight a red demon wearing a demon mask and carrying a wooden club. The red demon is defeated and flees from the shrine grounds, running throughout all the parishioner neighborhoods, followed by young men wearing hakama with demon-crest patterns and red tabi socks, shouting "Ā-kāi, ā-kāi," scattering Tankiri candy along the way. People compete to pick it up believing it prevents summer illness. Other ancient elegant ceremonies are performed including Hinode kagura, archery, Hanadaka's naginata dance, Pontenzara, Chimba dance, Hanadaka Shitennō, kagura children, Sasara children's kagura, Enoki-ō competition, and the procession of Kashira-sama (head deity), etc. On this day, roadside stalls sell tengu masks, demon masks, naginata, wooden clubs, etc. related to this Shinto ritual.
　　　　　　　　　55　Nehan-e (Nirvana Assembly)　(15th day)　Old custom
　In our country this was first performed at Yamashina-dera temple in Kyoto in the early Heian period, becoming a permanent custom of that temple for a long time, but later came to be performed at the imperial court, and temples throughout the provinces followed this example in holding Nehan-e ceremonies. On this day each temple displays nirvana images and gives "nose dirt" to children who come to worship.

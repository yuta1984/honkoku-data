came to pass, and consequently some changes were recognized in the city planning as well. Therefore, it is believed that blacksmiths were gradually permitted to move out to the main street. However, there is a theory recorded in the "Record of Yoshida in Three Provinces" that it was during the time of Mizuno Kenbutsu that these blacksmiths were moved to the present main street, but it is unclear what sources this account was based upon. Therefore, I have decided to present the traditions passed down in this blacksmith town for your reference.

Now, Matsudaira Tadatoshi died of illness on May 5, Kan'ei 9, and on August 11 of that year, his son Tadafusa inherited the remaining domain of 20,000 koku but was simultaneously transferred to Kariya Castle, as I mentioned previously. In exchange, the one who came to Yoshida Castle was Mizuno Hayato-no-shō Tadakiyo, who had been at Kariya until then. In other words, Tadafusa and Tadakiyo completely exchanged their domains. I would now like to discuss this Mizuno Hayato-no-shō and the situation in Yoshida during his era.

**Mizuno Hayato-no-shō Tadakiyo transferred from Kariya to this place** ⦿Mizuno Hayato-no-shō

**Mizuno Hayato-no-shō Tadakiyo exchanges with Matsudaira Tonomo-no-kami Tadafusa** As I mentioned in the previous chapter, on August 11, Kan'ei 9, Matsudaira Tonomo-no-kami Tadafusa succeeded his deceased father Matsudaira Tadatoshi and was simultaneously transferred to Kariya in the same province of Mikawa. In exchange, Mizuno Hayato-no-shō Tadakiyo came from Kariya and was enfeoffed as lord of Yoshida Castle.

**Mizuno Tadamasa** This Tadakiyo was the grandson of the well-known Mizuno Uemon-no-tayū Tadamasa and the youngest son of Izumi-no-kami Tadashige. Tadamasa was the father of Tokugawa Ieyasu's birth mother, a member of the Mizuno clan. At that time, Tadamasa was also residing at Kariya Castle and died in July of Tenbun 12. However, his heir Nobumoto succeeded the house and began negotiating with Oda Nobuhide of Owari. Since Ieyasu's father Hirotada was at that time an unwavering supporter of the Imagawa clan, he considered this extremely unacceptable behavior and finally divorced his wife of the Mizuno clan, sending her back to Kariya. She remarried into the Hisamatsu family, and as I have mentioned several times before...

**Mizuno Tadashige** ...she later became known as Dentsu-in. This Hayato-no-shō Tadakiyo's father Tadashige was, needless to say, Nobumoto's brother, making him the younger brother. However, the brothers did not get along well, and he lived at a place called Washizuka, constantly belonging to the Tokugawa faction and showing particular loyalty to Ieyasu. Later, in Tenshō 3, when Nobumoto was killed, in the ninth month of Tenshō 8, he came to reside at Kariya Castle, the ancestral land of his forefathers. However, in his later years, for some reason he followed Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and when Ishida Mitsunari raised arms in Keichō 5, he was killed by Kagai Yahachirō Hidemori at Chiryū station at the age of sixty. Tadakiyo was his fourth son and youngest child. In the spring of Keichō 7, he was attached to Tokugawa Hidetada, became head of the palace guard, received noble rank and also served as an announcer, participating in both Osaka campaigns. On April 3, Genna 2, when Ieyasu's illness became critical, he summoned Tadakiyo and granted him Kariya Castle with 20,000 koku, saying it was "the ancestral domain of your forefathers." And now he has finally been transferred to this Yoshida Castle with 40,000 koku.

**Tadakiyo's Increase** Soon after, on August 11, Kan'ei 11, there was an increase of 5,000 koku in his domain. Prior to this, on June 20 of that year, Shogun Iemitsu departed Edo for Kyoto. The entourage at that time was quite magnificent - Date Masamune had already departed as the advance guard on the first day of the sixth month, and the total number of daimyo, minor lords, and their retainers was approximately 307,000 men. Mito's Yorifusa-kyō brought up the rear, and the famous Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami Nobutsuna, who had already entered the ranks of senior retainers by this time, directed various matters along the route.

**Shogun Iemitsu's Journey to Kyoto** At this time, Shogun Iemitsu lodged at Hamamatsu on the first day of the seventh month, visited Suwa Shrine on the second day and donated 200 koku of new shrine land, and spent that night at Yoshida.

**Events During the Stay at Yoshida** Regarding this occasion, the "Tokugawa Jitsuroku" contains the following account:

"At the hour of the monkey, he arrived at Yoshida Castle. Castle lord Mizuno Hayato-no-shō Tadakiyo provided entertainment and was granted a Samonji sword. After nightfall, Owari Dainagon Yoshinao-kyō sent his retainer Takekoshi Yamashiro-no-kami Masanobu as a welcoming party. Also, since yesterday Ōta Bitchū-no-kami Sukemune had been sent to inquire about Mito Chūnagon Yorifusa-kyō's health, today an envoy was sent to express gratitude. Also, Takahashi Kyūbē, who had come as an envoy from Ōmiya, went mad at Yoshida and wounded three passersby with his sword. However, since he carried a message from Ōmiya, no one dared approach him. At that time, Kagauri Kai-no-kami Nao...

domains as well, I believe), with various matters

naturally brewing suspicion toward the bakufu at this time, when the Great Elder, with his forceful disposition, held political power, there was no room for various considerations and discretions, and throughout the nation

borrowing the bakufu's authority, strict controls were implemented, with various confinements and such being ordered. This was like when a great bandit daily watches the gate while the master, oblivious, holds banquets - even when brothers and servants, having long noticed the danger, earnestly petition for strict internal and external security measures, not only are they ignored, but the great bandit is invited into the house while those brothers and servants are condemned to punishment and death sentences. Others hearing this either sneer or pity them, but none come to their aid. Throughout history, many instances of national security and survival have resembled this situation. Therefore, I surmise that the great outside domains generally abandoned the bakufu from around this time. The preceding and following

Imperial intentions were not communicated through, the sincere efforts of the Three Branch Houses came to nothing and were heard as treasonous, and particularly groundless

matters such as abdication became nearly critical affairs (these were entirely empty words and false theories of subordinates, not worthy of belief) that influenced public sentiment to such a degree. From then on, false theories gained the momentum of a soaring dragon while righteous arguments developed a dispirited tendency, leading to unexpected incidents like the Kōshin-jōmi disturbances and the Kiyū fifth-month riots - what is called "the body may be bent but righteousness must not be bent" - which I believe represents the natural order of things (the ebb and flow of yin and yang, the mutual advance and retreat of right and wrong - these principles are detailed in the Book of Changes, so recognizing the moment and rising to action is essential). Therefore,

I fearfully surmise that the bakufu too was gradually coming to realization. Those cunning English and French barbarians, extremely crafty and quick to seize opportunities, said that if the righteous arguments in temporary retreat should once gain extension and false theories reach the pinnacle of power, their greedy desires would inevitably continue, saying: "Prince Mito plotted rebellion, his remaining faction continues in office carrying on his will, making universal peace and trust ultimately unattainable - we secretly worry for your country's sake" - such was the world's public opinion (Lord Nariaki was feared and revered by the five continents, and after his death, a Frenchman, hearing of it, sighed and said: "One of the foremost figures among the five continents has now been lost - we sigh for the world's sake." This appears to be an inadvertent expression of true feeling). They also said: "One cause of your country's inexperience in foreign relations lies entirely in the obstruction by these rebellious elements. Since these rebellious elements have their base, if we immediately notify our home country and dispatch several warships to Mito territory, we believe the rebellious elements will gather at their base. Then, binding them together and massacring all the Hitachi men at once would be the greatest blessing for Japan" - such

slanderous, poisonous, insulting, and utterly outrageous statements were reportedly made (in truth, such "great blessings" for the barbarians were merely trial proposals, seeing that the senior councilors were troubled about their own safety, it seems). However, how did the senior councilors receive these words? Afterward, there were reportedly open discussions about this with the Three Branch Houses and others within the castle (surely they would not think this reasonable, but given their genuine deep concern about extremist lawbreakers at the time, perhaps they found some merit in it?).

The current Lord of Mito, being of gentle disposition and having long been deeply concerned about his extremist, law-breaking retainers, was reportedly almost prostrated with displeasure at this - though this is merely hearsay. However, such rumors can hardly be credited.

Furthermore, judging from the official announcements and such, thereafter there was absolutely no mention of coastal defense or expelling foreigners, with concern focused solely on domestic evil barbarians and lawbreaking scholars. Fearfully, His Lordship made no pilgrimages to the two mountains, and even the senior councilors' ascent to the castle from the slope - a mere few dozen steps - became a matter of extreme apprehension. While measures regarding the unpredictable foreign barbarians remained expedient and dilatory, investigations of our righteous but extremist remnants were extraordinarily strict, with frequent talk of incidents, military preparations being announced, and daily warfare seeming imminent - treating righteous, passionate groups entirely as enemies naturally

corresponds to the principle of the bakufu itself fermenting and inciting the seeds of domestic warfare (for example, steam naturally boils and becomes more violent when the lid is pressed down; water's nature is to flow downward, but if struck and prevented from flowing, it can be made to exist even on mountains. The bakufu's failure to consider these natural forces was, I fearfully submit, a policy error). Therefore, the recent overflowing disturbances in the Kinai region and elsewhere were, I fearfully believe, entirely

the result of such inflammatory policies by the bakufu itself (the disturbances in Satsuma and Chikuzen domains, and the unexpected developments in Higo and Chōshū domains, were reportedly of earlier origin. Domains like Higo, having received particularly deep favors from the bakufu and considering themselves equivalent to hereditary retainers, were greatly troubled by these events, though they were assigned to guard the capital area at enormous expense. Fearfully, the bakufu's policies showed lack of attention in all respects - such rumors from a certain Higo domain man I heard last autumn).

Now, since the Imperial intentions of previous years were not communicated through, there naturally

developed estrangement between Court and bakufu, so to achieve reconciliation, suddenly

the matter of marriage alliance with an Imperial sister was proposed, but

His Majesty was extremely unwilling, leading to various persistent entreaties, until finally last winter the descent [to Edo] was completed. However, fundamentally

the estrangement between Court and bakufu arose

from the failure to communicate Imperial intentions through. The communication of Imperial intentions means, I believe, the solemn establishment of national polity and national policy. Therefore,

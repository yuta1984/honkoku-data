matters have been investigated. I would like to add this as a supplementary note here.

**Lord Kuze Izumo-no-kami**

As mentioned in the previous chapter, the Ogasawara family had four successive generations - Iki-no-kami Tadatomo, Naganori, Nagasuke, and Nagashige - who served as lords of Yoshida. During Nagashige's time, on the 19th day of the 4th month of Genroku 10 [1697], he was promoted from Kyoto Deputy to Senior Councilor, granted an additional 10,000 koku in domain lands, and simultaneously ordered to transfer to Iwatsuki Castle in Musashi Province.

**Kuze Shigeyuki Enfeoffed at Yoshida**
The person who was subsequently enfeoffed as lord of Yoshida was Kuze Izumo-no-kami Shigeyuki. On the 10th day of the 6th month of Genroku 10, he was transferred here from Kameyama in Tanba Province and held 50,000 koku.

**Kuze Hironobu**
Originally, the Kuze family is said to be descendants of Grand Minister Michihiro. Shigeyuki's grandfather Hironobu was a retainer of the Tokugawa clan who initially served under Ōsuga Yasutaka and later achieved numerous military distinctions, so Ieyasu granted him a 300-koku fief in Bōda District, Kazusa Province.

**Kuze Hiroyuki**
Subsequently, he received several increases in fief and eventually held 7,000 koku. His third son was named Hiroyuki, who advanced through the ranks to be appointed Yamato-no-kami, eventually rising to Senior Councilor and becoming lord of Sekijuku Castle in Shimōsa Province. Shigeyuki was this Hiroyuki's third son who inherited his father's domain on the 6th day of the 8th month of Enpō 7 [1679], was transferred to Hirose in Bitchū Province on the 21st day of the 8th month of Tenna 3 [1683], and further transferred to Kameyama in Tanba on the 26th day of the 1st month of Jōkyō 3 [1686], before coming to Yoshida this time.

**Shigeyuki Again Transferred to Sekijuku**
The Genroku era lasted until the 16th year, after which it changed to Hōei in the 17th year. In that year, on the 9th day of the 10th month, Shigeyuki concurrently served as magistrate of temples and shrines, was appointed to the position of junior councilor on the 21st day of the 9th month of the 2nd year, and on the last day of the 10th month was again transferred to his former domain of Sekijuku. Consequently, his residence at this place lasted only ten years.

Shigeyuki later advanced to the position of Senior Councilor on the 3rd day of the 8th month of Shōtoku 3 [1713], served for eight years, and died on the 27th day of the 6th month of Kyōhō 5 [1720] at the age of 61. This man was truly loyal and steadfast and had quite remarkable episodes during his tenure as Senior Councilor.

**Main Text:**
Although this has no direct bearing on our city's history, his appointment as Senior Councilor came after the death of the 5th Shogun Tsunayoshi, shortly after Ienobu became the 6th Shogun. He participated in and strategized considerably in the so-called Shōtoku administration. Moreover, in his later years he held great weight in the government during the 8th Shogun Yoshimune's Kyōhō administration. As an aside, the current Viscount Kuze Hironari is his descendant.

**Mercy for Living Beings**
There are one or two matters I would like to discuss here. During Shigeyuki's residence in this region, as mentioned before, it was during the reign of the 5th Shogun Tsunayoshi, particularly during the Genroku period when, as you all well know, the infamous "mercy for living beings" policy imposed severe punishment on anyone who harmed birds or beasts. In the 3rd month of Genroku 14 [1701], a man named Ichibei from Asuke-machi, for some unknown reason, cut down a horse in Fudagi-machi in Yoshida, causing a great commotion. This person was eventually captured and sentenced to death by beheading. This is recorded in the "Sanshū Yoshida-ki."

**Commendation of Filial Sons**
There is one more matter recorded in the same book regarding the commendation of filial sons in Hōei 1 [1704]:

"Heisaku of Seko-machi, though his family was poor, was capable of filial care for his parents, and was therefore rewarded with six bags of wheat."

This appears to be the earliest clear record of a filial son being commended in Yoshida during the Tokugawa period.

**Lord Makino Bizen-no-kami**

As mentioned in the previous chapter, Kuze Izumo-no-kami Shigeyuki resided at this place for only about ten years before being transferred back to his former domain of Sekijuku in Shimōsa Province. The person who succeeded him and was enfeoffed here was Makino Bizen-no-kami Nariharu.

**Makino Nariharu**
As you know, this person's ancestor was Makino Shinjirō Narisada, who has been mentioned frequently before and who was from Ushikubo. Narisada's son was Yasunari, whose story has also

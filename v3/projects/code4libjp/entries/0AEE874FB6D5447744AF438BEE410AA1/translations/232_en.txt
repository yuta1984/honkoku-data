Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Foreign Affairs Issues and Yoshida Domain) 438

**Main Text:**
When dispatched, I gradually explained the situation to him, and he said it would be truly valuable, so he examined all the remaining manuscripts, and as a result, many items were donated to the Academy of Sciences by his grandson Haruji.

**Fukutani Keikichi**
Next I would like to discuss Fukutani Keikichi, which I believe you are all well acquainted with. This man was from Kaya-machi in Yoshida, his father was called Kikuzō, and he was born in the seventh month of Bunsei 2. Not only do his descendants still live in Toyohashi, but the well-known Fukutani Tōshichi and others are also his relatives.

As I mentioned before, the shogunate finally decided in Ansei 2 to send naval cadets to Nagasaki for the first time. At this time, the shogunate sent over thirty selected students including the famous Katsu Rintarō (Awa, Kaishū). This marked the beginning of our country's navy, and at that time various domains also obtained shogunate permission to send their own cadets.

The domains of Kagoshima, Kumamoto, Fukuoka, Hagi, Saga, Tsu, Fukuyama, and Kakegawa all sent varying numbers of students, but among them, Saga domain - that is, Lord Nabeshima - sent the most students. Keikichi was adopted by Lord Nabeshima at this time and joined the naval cadets as a Saga domain samurai. Looking at the student roster from that time, among those sent from Saga domain we can see names like Keikichi, Sano Eijūzaemon (Tsunetami), and Nakamuta Kuranosuke.

However, these students faced considerable hardships in their studies, with some studying for two to three years and others for four to five years. I don't think I have time to describe all the details of their arduous studies, so I will omit these.

Finally in Ansei 6, when the students' skills had become proficient, the shogunate decided to attempt ocean voyages, sending the warship Kanrin-maru (which had arrived from Holland in the ninth month of Ansei 4) to San Francisco in America. Naval magistrate Kimura Settsu-no-kami (Kaishu) boarded with selected students, departing Japan from Yokohama in the twelfth month of that year, successfully reaching that country and returning safely in the fifth month of the following year, Man'en 1.

**Main Text:**
This was the first instance of Japanese operating a Japanese warship and traveling to foreign countries. It was also at this time that Fukuzawa Yukichi traveled abroad under the name of being Kimura Settsu-no-kami's servant.

**Fukutani Keikichi's Journey to America**
Under such circumstances, Saga domain also decided to select two students to send to America for foreign observation, and Keikichi was one of those chosen. In Man'en 1, he boarded a foreign ship from Yokohama and traveled to America. At that time, Keikichi's father Kikuzō was ill and recuperating at home in Kaya-machi, Yoshida. When departing, Keikichi rushed overland from Saga to Yokohama, stopping only briefly for a few hours to visit his father's sickbed for their final farewell. His father died on May 16 of that year, by which time Keikichi had already arrived in America.

Indeed, Keikichi heard of the assassination of Senior Councilor Ii while in Washington. Since the Senior Councilor's assassination occurred on March 3 of that year, it's clear that Keikichi had departed Japan before then. Keikichi returned safely on September 28 of that year, and a diary of his return voyage is preserved in the Fukutani Tōshichi family house. This is quite interesting, though it's regrettable that the earlier portion is missing.

After this, he continued to sail to China under Lord Nabeshima's orders, entering the interior to conduct research on Chinese trade. After the Meiji Restoration, he served in the Ministry of Public Works, advancing to first-class clerk. However, around Meiji 16 he retired and spent much time in Toyohashi, dying of illness at age 71 in Meiji 22. His grave is at Shōrin-ji temple in Hanazono-chō, Toyohashi City. The printed materials and other implements he brought back from America when he returned in Man'en 1, as well as textile samples he later brought back from China, are still preserved at Fukutani Tōshichi's residence.

As described above, Fukutani Keikichi became one of Japan's first naval cadets as a Saga domain samurai and traveled to America in Man'en 1, but he was originally a townsman from our Yoshida.

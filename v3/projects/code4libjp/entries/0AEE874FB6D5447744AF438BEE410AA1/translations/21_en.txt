Toyohashi Historical Discussion　　(Construction of Imahashi Castle and Makino Kohaku)　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　16
【Main text】
　　　　　　University's "Dai Nihon Shiryō" (Great Historical Materials of Japan) clearly recognizes them as direct descendants of Kohaku. Indeed, after Kohaku, his son Narimitsu
　　　　　　succeeded him, but Narimitsu further adopted his younger brother Nobushige. When this Nobushige was killed in battle by Matsudaira Kiyoyasu, his pregnant wife
　　　　　　fled to Chita District in Owari Province and later gave birth to a child named Naritsugu. Naritsugu's son was called Narisato, and this person was quite valorous, being summoned by Tokugawa Ieyasu
　　　　　　through Ikeda Terumasa's introduction and serving as an attendant to the second shogun Hidetada. This became the ancestor of the Iyo-no-kami house,
Makino Genealogies　so I recognized the need to investigate this house first, but this house has two genealogies, old and new, passed down.
　　　　　　The older one, despite some differences, generally matches the "Kan'ei Keizu" and has many points of agreement with the Makino genealogy cited in unofficial histories.
　　　　　　However, the newer one was created much later and is quite detailed in its investigation, but it seems to have been compiled after the Kansei era.
　　　　　　In any case, these genealogies, along with the records passed down in the houses of the Makino clan including the aforementioned Nagaoka and Tanabe houses, should serve as excellent references
Kohaku's Origins　alongside various works like "Kan'ei Keizu" and "Kansei Chōshū Shokafu." Now, regarding Makino Kohaku's origins, the accounts in various books do not agree due to the circumstances described above,
　　　　　　but according to what the "Kansei Chōshū Shokafu" records, this man called Kohaku was the son of Makino Naritomi, and this man Naritomi
　　　　　　was also known as Yorishige and held the title Saemon-no-jō. During the Ōei era, by order of Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimochi, he first came to Makino Village in Chūjō-gō, Hoi District, Mikawa Province
Makino Naritomi　and took the surname Makino. Originally, this man was a descendant of the Heike warrior Taguchi Shigeyoshi (Naruyoshi),
　　　　　　and among Shigeyoshi's children was one called Tauchi Saemon Noriyoshi, also known as Narināo, but after the fall of the Heike, they scattered and their genealogy became unclear.
　　　　　　However, among his descendants was one called Taguchi Saemon-no-jō Nariyasu, and his son was called Tami Saemon Narikiyo, who was
　　　　　　Naritomi's father. Up to this man's generation, they lived in Sanuki Province, but in Naritomi's generation, they came from Sanuki Province to this Makino Village,
Naritomi's Tomb　according to the records. Indeed, Naritomi's grave remains in a place called Yanagaizu in Makino Village, and this tomb can be
　　　　　　recognized as authentic. Also, in the house of Mr. Makino Sachi in Makino Village are preserved sutras copied by the monk Jitsuzan of Fukushōji Temple and an old map of Makino Village.

Fukushōji Temple　These sutras are quite magnificent, and this Fukushōji Temple is said to be the temple that Naritomi deeply revered,
　　　　　　and the ruins of the temple are also shown on that old map. Now, the fact that Kohaku used the given name Shigetoki
　　　　　　is as I mentioned before, and he also held the title Saemon-no-jō, but there are traces that he initially also used the name Toshinari. This is because
　　　　　　there is a ridge beam tablet at Zaigaji Temple in Hoi District written "Bunmei 15th year, Makino Shuri-no-shin Toshinari," and in the records of the Tanabe Makino house and the Miyajima
Toshinari's Name　biography it says "Toshinari was perhaps Kohaku's name in his youth," and also in the same Makino house genealogy it says "Shigetoki, initially Toshinari." Of course,
　　　　　　the name Kohaku is a monastic name adopted after taking the tonsure, but the "Hankanfu" writes this as Kohaku (古柏). There are many books that write it as Kohaku (古伯),
Kohaku vs Kohaku　but I believe writing it as Kohaku (古白) is most reliable. The best evidence for this comes from the Zaigaji Temple ridge beam tablet from Meiō 4th year
　　　　　　and the ridge beam tablet from Meiō 6th year at Naka-ya Shinmei Shrine in Toyohashi City. The one at Shinmei Shrine still exists today, and both write it as Kohaku (古白).
　　　　　　There is also the renga poet Sōchō's "Sōchō Shuki." This Sōchō served as a page to Imagawa Yoshitada, later became a disciple of Sōgi
Sōchō Shuki　and studied renga, was summoned again by Ujichika, had a most intimate relationship with Kohaku, and frequently came to Imahashi at that time to partner in renga.
　　　　　　"Sōchō Shuki" was written by this man and is included in Hanawa Hokinoichi's "Gunsho Ruijū." This "Sōchō
　　　　　　Shuki" is a diary-like work covering events from Daiei 4th year to the 7th year, and though it covers events after Kohaku's death, it clearly records
　　　　　　his interactions with Kohaku. However, this also writes it as Kohaku (古白) and does not write it as Kohaku (古柏) or Kohaku (古伯).
　　　　　　Indeed, what requires research as one problem here is the existence of a ridge beam tablet from Zaigaji Temple's Bunmei 3rd year that reads "Petitioner Makino Kohaku (古伯)."
　　　　　　Until now, this Kohaku (古伯) has been regarded as the same person as Kohaku (古白) Shigetoki, but judging from this period, he might perhaps be
　　　　　　a different person. This is because Kohaku died in battle in Eishō 3rd year, making it 36 years distant from the Bunmei 3rd year mentioned on this tablet.
　　　　　　And since the name Kohaku is a monastic name adopted after taking the tonsure, as mentioned before, he could hardly have taken the name Kohaku in his teens or twenties. He would need to be at least thirty years old.

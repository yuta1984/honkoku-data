hearing that they were the most outstanding heroes, [Yoshiaki] sent secret envoys including Yamato Awaji-no-kami to these three provinces requesting the assassination of Nobunaga. Those documents are also preserved at Shōkō-in of Mount Yoshino. Given this situation, to eliminate the Oda clan, the Tokugawa house was the foremost rising power at the time, and the Tokugawa house was what the Oda clan relied upon. Therefore, [the plan was] first to overthrow the Tokugawa house, then invade Owari Province to destroy the Oda and raise banners in the Chūgoku region. For this purpose, Shingen broke his alliance, raised an unjustified army, and attempted to invade Tōtōmi and Mikawa. This is why the great battle of Mimatagahara occurred. When Katsuyori's time came, Yoshiaki again requested that he join with the Hōjō clan in a conspiracy to destroy the Oda. The messenger for this was Makishima Genba-no-suke. These documents are also preserved at Shōkō-in. This is why Katsuyori frequently attempted to attack Mikawa and Tōtōmi, and why the great battle of Nagashino occurred. Yoshiaki ultimately failed to achieve his objectives and later went down to Geishū to rely on the Mōri. This became the cause of the Toyotomi clan's Chūgoku campaign. Therefore, while the three great battles of Anegawa, Mimatagahara, and Nagashino represented mortal crises for our house, in reality they originated from Ashikaga Yoshiaki's schemes, with Asakura, Takeda and others using their treacherous plots to attempt to fulfill their usurpation ambitions. In general, from the Tōji-in Shogun onward, the Muromachi house made it their eternal and unchanging policy to accomplish their objectives by borrowing others' power, and after achieving success, to use other people's hands to eliminate those who had served them. This practice continued for fifteen generations without anyone abandoning this old stratagem. That they ultimately lost the nation through these same old schemes - was this not Heaven's will?

Such being the case, around this time there was a Tokugawa deputy named Ōga Yashirō who controlled the taxes of over twenty villages in the interior districts. Though he lacked for nothing, he harbored considerable unreasonable ambitions and secretly collaborated with the Takeda clan, plotting to seize Okazaki Castle. This also became one of the immediate causes, so in the fourth month of Tenshō 3, Katsuyori finally led a great army of over twelve thousand troops to invade Mikawa from Shinano. However, prior to this, Ōga's plot was exposed and all his family members were captured, so this was somewhat of a setback for Katsuyori's plans. Nevertheless, undeterred by such matters, he immediately divided off over two thousand troops to first besiege Nagashino Castle, while he himself led the remaining large army and on the sixth day of the fifth month set fire to Ushikubo and Rengi, then attacked this Yoshida Castle.

The Battle of Rengi: At this time Ieyasu had come from Hamamatsu and was at Yoshida Castle. First there was a battle between Takeda troops and the defenders of Rengi. Though Rengi's castle lord Toda Yasunaga was still young, his retainers obtained eighteen enemy heads and presented them for Ieyasu's inspection. This is recorded in Yasunaga's genealogy in the "Kansei Revised Genealogies of Various Houses." The "Mikawa Monogatari" also records that there was fighting at Hajikamigahara, and this Hajikamigahara refers to the present location of Rengi. At that time Ieyasu positioned five thousand troops in the suburbs of Yoshida, but on Sakai Tadatsugu's advice, they decided to withdraw the troops into the castle, with Tadatsugu serving as rear guard. The Takeda vanguard Yamagata Masakage pursued them, so Tadatsugu turned his horse to fight him, successfully bringing all troops safely into the castle without casualties. The following day the two armies fought three more times, and it is said that Tadatsugu and Masakage exchanged words and decided battles twice. However, Katsuyori did not dare press the attack on the castle, and on the following eighth day gathered his entire army at Nagashino, completely surrounding Nagashino Castle. At that time Ieyasu's eldest son Nobuyasu had come out and taken position at Hōzō-ji temple in the mountains. According to the "Mikawa Monogatari," from there both Ieyasu and Nobuyasu's banners advanced toward Noda. On the other hand, it is also written in the "Matsudaira-ki" that on the tenth day they sent fast horses to request reinforcements from Oda Nobunaga. Therefore Nobunaga departed Gifu on the thirteenth to provide assistance, spent that night at Atsuta, and on the following fourteenth day, when his son Nobutada arrived at Okazaki, he himself came to Chiryū. The "Matsudaira-ki" states that Nobunaga's arrival at Okazaki was on the fifteenth, but the General Staff's "Japanese Military History: The Nagashino Campaign" indicates he arrived within the fourteenth day. In any case, it can be considered fact that Nobunaga was at Okazaki on the fifteenth.

At this time, what was the situation inside Nagashino Castle? Okudaira Nobumasa (Sadamasa) was the commander, assisted by Matsudaira Kagetada, his son Jiseichō, and Matsudaira Chikatoshi, but the troop strength was only around five hundred. Facing an enemy force of thirteen thousand (Katsuyori's force was said to be twenty thousand, but I believe the actual number was over thirteen thousand), with food supplies sufficient for only four or five more days, they desperately needed to report this situation to Ieyasu and determine how far the Oda reinforcements had advanced. On the fourteenth day, when the Takeda forces launched their general assault...

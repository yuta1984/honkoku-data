Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Imperial Restoration and Yoshida Domain) 598

**Main Text:**
succeeded his father, but he was by nature an extremely gentle person, and his refined elegance and taste truly came from natural endowment. Later, for certain reasons, he became stationed in the home domain, but as you know, since Ono Kozan was confined in this Yoshida, he developed a deep friendship with him, constantly serving as his disciple and receiving his teachings.

Then, on the 20th day of the first month of Keiō 1 (Genji 2), he was ordered by domain lord Nobuhisa to go to Edo for military studies, and departed Yoshida on February 12th. There are poems by Rokusaburō from that time. These were collected by Ono Kozan in a book called "Kozanrō Poetry Screens." They are also included in that collection, but among those presented below, what is recorded first was written by Kozan, and the later poems were composed by Rokusaburō at the time of this departure for the capital.

(Poems concerning Shidō's departure for the capital) I should add that Rokusaburō's given names were Yoshioki or Yoshiju, and his literary names were Shidō or Chidō.

Yoshioki, courtesy name Ennen, literary names Chidō and Shidō, a person of Yoshida. Shidō had a thin physique as if unable to bear the weight of his clothes, but was naturally intelligent with exceptional talent and spirit. His poetry showed endless variation and transformation, composed without apparent effort, yet surpassing those who studied with great hardship. He also understood foreign writing early but did not become obsessed with foreign methods. He was well-versed in military strategy but did not enjoy discussing warfare. Having extensively studied national histories and miscellaneous records, he thoroughly understood the social conditions and human nature of past and present. In dealing with people, he was humble and gentle like an ordinary person. He was indeed a naturally gifted prodigy. I often praised him to others, but many did not believe me. It was not only that people would not believe it - even if Shidō himself had heard it directly, he would not have believed it either.

**About to Travel East, Farewell to the Gentlemen of Seiseisha**
東風吹促遠遊期　柳色青青春半時　豊水烟波帰昨夢　武城花月入吟思
一杯送別兼留別　満座新知興奮知　多謝諸公相厚意　彩箋争写餞吾詩

○

酔和驪歌意気雄　離情寄在酒杯中　身無妻子塵縁累　社有金蘭臭味同
擇善相師吾素志　以言贈別古遺風　自慚才学非丁老　一去誰人説易東

**Main Text:**
文士談兵未足奇　杜郎梅畟是吾師　半生事業孤燈在　十世君恩一剣知
客舎並州今日威　春天渭樹故人詩　雖然暂別又堪惜　満酌何辞金屈邑

**Same as Above, Shown to the Gentlemen**
渭城歌罷思紛紛　落日江山千里雲　憂命一朝酬宿志　遠遊三歳奈雖群
韜鈴要盡渭埃報　輸墨曽無尺寸功　惆悵断機人己去　空得別涙洒孤憤

**Reflections at Hakone**
曾侍阿兄過此山　客衣春暖落花間　何図今日氷霜底　独挈遺孤又入関

Among the above poems, particularly "Same as Above, Shown to the Gentlemen" contains elements that move readers to deep emotion. From this we can see that Shidō's departure for the capital at this time was something he had firmly resolved upon, but when he unexpectedly encountered Seiken on Mount Ueno, they both felt the strangeness of this coincidence and exchanged feelings about their long separation.

So Seiken said "well then" and took Shidō back to his lodgings in Negishi. As they gradually revealed their thoughts to each other, Shidō explained that he had left his home domain to study Yamaga-school military science, but secretly observing current conditions, it was absolutely necessary to master Western military methods. He had been greatly troubled by this matter, but having fortunately met you today, he wanted to receive your teachings. Moreover, there was still one person who had accompanied him from the home domain, and he was thinking of bringing him along as well. This being the situation, Seiken was greatly pleased, and on this day they simply promised to meet again before parting.

Indeed, the next day, despite a great storm, Shidō came with raincoat and hat, bringing one friend, and visited Seiken's lodgings again. This one person was someone you gentlemen know well and who is still vigorous today - that was Nakamura Michita.

So the three sat together and extensively discussed the future, but ultimately Nakamura decided to return home once more and then greatly

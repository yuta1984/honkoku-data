He ordered Masuda Nagamori, Ishida Mitsunari, and Natsuka Masaie to make the generals swear to cooperate in harmony to serve Hideyori, but this was only on the surface, and the generals' true feelings never reached mutual reconciliation. Consequently, various incidents occurred during this period, but ultimately Hideyoshi had Ieyasu decide on governmental affairs throughout the realm, made Maeda Toshiie Hideyori's guardian, and arranged for Mōri Terumoto, Uesugi Kagekatsu, Ukita Hideie and others to assist in politics from their positions, issuing various strategic orders. However, after Hideyoshi's death and the return of the overseas expedition generals, it became increasingly impossible to maintain smooth relations.

On the 10th day of the 1st month of Keichō 4 (1599), Hideyori moved to Osaka, and Ieyasu and all the other generals followed him there. However, on the night of the 11th, someone was seen prowling around Ieyasu's lodgings, so Ieyasu hastily returned to Fushimi the next morning. From then on, Ieyasu oversaw governmental affairs from Fushimi while Toshiie served as Hideyori's guardian in Osaka. The friction between the so-called civil administration faction and military faction not only continued unabated, but the military faction naturally came to rely on Ieyasu, and as his influence grew, the situation became increasingly precarious.

Therefore, Mitsunari and others concluded that the Toyotomi could never have peace in their realm unless Ieyasu was eliminated, so they plotted with Mōri, Ukita, Uesugi and others. Around this time, Ieyasu had privately arranged marriages with the Date, Fukushima, and Hachisuka houses without official permission, and when Osaka confronted him about this, public sentiment became quite agitated.

At this time, Ikeda Terumasa remained in Fushimi and, together with generals such as Katō Kiyomasa, Asano Yukinaga, Fukushima Masanori, Kuroda Josui and his son Nagamasa, Hachisuka Iemasa, Hosokawa Tadaoki (Nagaoka), Mori Tadamasa, Katō Yoshiaki, Tōdō Takatora, Kyōgoku Takatugu, Kanamori Nagachika, Oda Nagamasu, and Arima Noriyori, guarded Ieyasu's residence. Eventually the situation developed into a confrontation between the Osaka faction and Fushimi faction, with one side supporting Toshiie and the other supporting Ieyasu. Finally, someone like Hosokawa Tadaoki attempted mediation between them, and before long Toshiie and Ieyasu reconciled, but on the 3rd day of intercalary 3rd month, Toshiie finally died of illness in Osaka.

[Death of Maeda Toshiie] Thereupon, people like Katō, Kuroda, Hosokawa, Fukushima, and Asano plotted to eliminate Mitsunari and presented this to Ieyasu. At this time, Ieyasu had Mitsunari confined to his domain of Sawayama

where he was placed under house arrest, so the matter was temporarily settled. However, in the 6th month of that year, Ieyasu went to Osaka and had an audience with Hideyori, permitting many generals to return to their domains. Thus Hideie, Terumoto, Josui, Kiyomasa, Tadaoki and others returned to their domains one after another, and Uesugi Kagekatsu and Maeda Toshinaga also went to their domains. In the 9th month of that year, Ieyasu again went to Osaka and from then took up residence in the western castle there.

From then on, as Ieyasu's prestige grew ever greater, slander and suspicion arose on all sides, but Ieyasu also increasingly made arbitrary decisions, eventually taking hostages to Edo on his own authority, beginning with Maeda Toshinaga's mother.

As mentioned before, Ishida Mitsunari's plans had once gone awry and he was instead confined by Ieyasu to Sawayama, but he was certainly not one to remain quietly subdued. Ieyasu had anticipated this from the beginning, and his decision not to kill Mitsunari at that time but deliberately confine him to Sawayama was a deeply calculated move - historians evaluate this as a brilliant strategy devised by Ieyasu's strategist Honda Masanobu. Indeed, Mitsunari had made firm agreements with Uesugi Kagekatsu's senior retainer Naoe Kanetsugu, so after Kagekatsu went to his domain, he steadily repaired castle fortifications, recruited masterless samurai, and gathered provisions, making his hostility toward the Tokugawa increasingly clear.

Kagekatsu's domain was, as you know, Aizu in Mutsu, where he had built his castle in what is now Wakamatsu City in Iwashiro Province. This place called Aizu had initially been granted to Gamō Ujisato as mentioned before, but in the 3rd month of Keichō 3, Ujisato was transferred to Utsunomiya, and Kagekatsu was moved there from his former domain of Echigo.

Kagekatsu's activities were reported in detail to Ieyasu by warriors from Edo and the northeast, so in the 3rd month of Keichō 5 (1600), Ieyasu finally decided to attack him. However, due to opinions from Ukita Hideie, Mōri Terumoto and others, he sent an envoy to Aizu to urge Kagekatsu to come to court and questioned him about his recent activities. Moreover, he specifically sent the monk Shōtai, who was on intimate terms with Naoe Kanetsugu, to urge that Kagekatsu quickly come west to apologize for his actions.

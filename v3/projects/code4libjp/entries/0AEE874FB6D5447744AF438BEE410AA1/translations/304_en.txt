Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Imperial Restoration and Yoshida Domain) 582

**Main Text:**
At a time when military preparations were not fully adequate, the inability to carry out measures such as armed expulsion was perhaps an understandable course of action. Moreover, although we had maintained a policy of national isolation for three hundred years, in recent years when nations worldwide engage in communication and warfare, the isolation policy was naturally strict, but it was essential to prepare an opening policy in advance, using the opening policy to maintain the isolation policy, and employing offensive momentum to support defensive techniques - this being a fundamental principle of coastal defense. Therefore, I believe that after deciding on such policies, temporary expedient measures were implemented.

However, thereafter (there were occasions when the former Middle Councilor was told to visit the castle, and while outwardly it appeared he was being valued, in reality he was treated like a guest, with consultations only bringing up difficult matters related to the senior councilors' attempts to avoid blame, while the great reforms that Lord Nariaki had high hopes for received only superficial responses with no real implementation or vigor, leading Lord Nariaki to politely withdraw - such was the public opinion and rumor), the various foreign powers gathered one after another making demands, with Britain in particular boasting of its momentum in swallowing up China, while other foreign powers also used this as justification, generally following the precedent of the letter from the sixth month of Kaei 6.

During this period of the bakufu's indecisive measures, the foreign powers, thinking they must not lose this opportunity, persistently made lengthy demands, rapidly advancing from Uraga to Yokohama, from Yokohama into Edo castle itself (there is a book called "Japanese Travels" brought by the Dutch, from which this can be understood), gradually presenting various unreasonable demands and selfish requests without the slightest reserve or concern, their arrogance increasing daily. Surely at each occasion of negotiation, the responsible officials (including Iwase Shuri and other officials - their wisdom or foolishness and struggles, and even the foreigners' cunning observations of details, can be understood from works like "Japanese Travels") expended great effort and ingenuity, and while perhaps only one-tenth of their demands - those that were truly unavoidable - were granted, when one-tenth after one-tenth accumulates to become tens and hundreds, from the outside it appears that people grew weary of hearing "unavoidable, unavoidable," and the Great Elder and others became completely overwhelmed by their authority and schemes, readily granting whatever they demanded.

While initially for ten years there was talk of "military preparations, military preparations," this later ceased entirely, and generally there were no measures to refresh perspectives. Since the entire realm could not perceive that the bakufu truly intended to rouse itself for the expulsion of foreigners, the natural human tendency toward complacency and expedience took hold - like frogs in a well not knowing the great ocean, or sparrows building nests in fire - and ordinary clever men, not understanding matters deeply, initially felt shock and alarm but later became accustomed and comfortable with the situation. While occasionally hearing impassioned arguments, fearing to touch upon the bakufu's taboos, they generally...

...spoke only of stubborn rationalizations about what might happen in one's lifetime, and furthermore as foreign religions gradually spread, those who tasted even a little of their benefits easily promoted the mistaken theory of trade, saying: "Our customs are naturally narrow while their ways are extremely elevated. For us to doubt and think ill of their elevated truth through our narrow prejudices is naturally improper. Should we incur their wrath and brew resentment, if they use their powerful national strength to surround and invade our island nation, our dragonfly-like small country's power obviously cannot match theirs" - such seemingly reasonable but weak-spirited false arguments also arose.

Now, since this complacent and expedient human sentiment knows no distinction between high and low social ranks, such false theories about trade were easy to hear while righteous arguments for resolute action were difficult to implement. At a time when there was no clear deadline for when military preparations would be complete, when it seemed treaties might be exchanged in the year of Earth-Dog (Ansei 5, 1858), Lord Nariaki of Mito and others (with his brilliant and unprecedented character, his devotion to imperial reverence and expelling foreigners, and especially his sincere concern for the bakufu, as can be generally understood from his memorials such as "Meikun Ichiranchō" and "Suifu Kensaku." When the Lord of Hizen presented a poem saying "Among the heroes of the realm, few emerge; of lifelong confidants, I meet you alone," his reply poem stated "To unite Shinto and Confucianism and spread the great Way, one must rely on imperial relatives to serve the enlightened ruler." This can be seen in other works like "Hitachi-obi" and "Kaiten Shishi." Though he may have had some biased failings, his sincere concern for the public good of the realm is clearly evident), the Three Branch Houses (Lord Owari, though I hear nothing particular about him, is said to be one who steadfastly upholds correct principles), and the imperial relatives (the former Middle Captain of Echizen is also an enlightened lord with deep concerns for the country, as has been told since the early days of his succession to the Echizen house and recorded in works like "Fukuoka Genkōroku," and I understand he repeatedly advocated bringing Prince Hitotsubashi to the Western Castle during Lord Abe's administration) and others among the outside domains who held the realm dear, found their indignation and anguished concern unbearable, exhausting themselves in various memorials and sincere efforts. But without being employed, perhaps they had no choice but to resort to expedient measures. Since His Majesty would naturally find such men reliable,

though I do not know the detailed facts of that time, surely

their actions accorded with His Majesty's will. Therefore, some senior councilors were

summoned, and various

court deliberations took place, but this only increased the burdens and concerns of the Kantō without effect, so His Majesty thought it best to issue

imperial edicts to the Three Branch Houses to come to Kyoto, with the edict being sent to Mito. Accordingly, one of them would have proceeded to Kyoto, and strong arguments and admonitions regarding treaties and such matters would have been exhausted. (With imperial commands, especially in matters of great urgency, some said it was unlike Lord Nariaki's decisive character to observe ordinary protocols and await bakufu instructions, but this would contradict his cherished aspiration to "rely on imperial relatives to serve the enlightened ruler," and had such action been taken then, it would have been the same as the current actions of Satsuma and Chōshū [domains].)

○Insert annotation: Regarding our country's national polity and righteous spirit, it is difficult to engage in momentary debate with those who advocate false theories. For now, I will set this aside without argument.

**Annotation for line 13:**
○Insert annotation: Britain was considered the foremost power at that time, with no part of the five continents free from British encroachment. Yet their homeland is also merely a small country, not particularly different from our nation. Our country's divine military prowess has always been feared by the five continents. If we were to demonstrate our military might, the recent imperial declaration to make our imperial country the world's greatest power would indeed depend entirely on how the bakufu conducts itself - what a regrettable matter this is.

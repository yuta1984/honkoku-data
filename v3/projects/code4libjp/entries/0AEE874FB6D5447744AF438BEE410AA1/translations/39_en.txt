Therefore, comparing with these facts, it is clear that this document dates to Tenbun 16. Consequently, the passage "regarding last year's devoted efforts at Yoshida Castle" corresponds with the previously mentioned attack on Yoshida in the 15th year, further confirming these facts. Moreover, from the meaning of phrases like "hardships of garrison duty in Mikawa Province," it appears that Aki-no-kami had been stationed at Yoshida Castle since the previous year to guard it.

Now, the Toda clan at Tahara fell into a temporarily defeated state in this battle, but this was the point where the Tahara Toda and Ninrengi Toda clearly separated into two distinct houses. Subsequently, the previously mentioned Tadamasa, Yasumitsu's younger brother, demonstrated loyalty to the Matsudaira clan in western Mikawa, and through his son Tadatsugu, by the time of Takatsugu, was again enfeoffed at Tahara by Ieyasu and entered the ranks of feudal lords. This became the so-called later Tahara Toda, whose descendant was the lord of Utsunomiya Castle in Shimotsuke Province at the time of the Meiji Restoration.

Also, Yoshimitsu, who built his castle at Ninrengi, fortunately was not affected by these battles of Tenbun 15 and 16, so he continued to maintain his castle. This house was the Ninrengi Toda, whose descendants were the lords of Matsumoto Castle in Shinano Province at the time of the Meiji Restoration.

I would also like to add regarding Yoshimitsu, the younger brother of Masamitsu. After the fall of Tahara in Tenbun 16, this person lived in Kaji in the Tahara area, but later moved to Ninrengi and died on the 25th day of the 9th month of Eiroku 8, so he was buried at Shōen-ji temple in Nami-no-ue, Yana district. What is commonly called the Nami-no-ue Toda is precisely this person's house.

● Supplement: Regarding the Death in Battle of Makino Kohaku
The death in battle of Makino Kohaku occurred on the 3rd day of the 11th month of Eishō 3, and regarding this, there are two theories - the Imagawa Ujichika attack theory and the Matsudaira Nagachika counterattack theory - as I have already explained in detail in the previous chapter. However, from the 20th to the 22nd of the 8th month of this year, there was a battle at the Yahagi River between the Imagawa and Matsudaira clans, where the Imagawa forces became disadvantaged and finally withdrew their army to Imahashi, then retreated to Suruga. Since Kohaku belonged to the Imagawa forces in this battle, the Kansei Chōshū Shokafu's adoption of the Matsudaira Nagachika counterattack theory regarding Kohaku's death in battle

should be followed, as I also stated in that chapter. However, I also mentioned at that time, citing documents from Myōgen-ji temple in Kuwako village, Nukata district, that doubts still remained in this matter.

Subsequently, through the kindness of Dr. Mikami and Literature Scholar Watanabe Seisuke, I was able to examine documents in the collection of the Historical Materials Compilation Office of Tokyo Imperial University that serve as considerable evidence for these facts. These are documents that the Historical Materials Compilation Office obtained by chance, and this is also a very recent development.

The owner of these documents is a person from Mimasaka Province surnamed Date, who is said to belong to a family that shares ancestors with the Date clan of the former Sendai domain. These documents are letters of appreciation given by Imagawa Ujichika and Hōjō Sōun to his ancestor, Date Kurando-no-jō, who lived in Mikawa Province during the Eishō period and worked for the Imagawa clan. The full texts are as follows:

"Regarding this Mikawa campaign, your distinguished devoted efforts are most admirable and gratifying. That you will continue to work energetically in the future is also cause for joy. Asahina Yazaburō will inform you further. With fear and respect, humbly stated.
　　November 16th　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Ujichika (seal)
　　　　　　　　Lord Date Kurando-no-jō"

"Regarding this time in Mikawa Province, the battle on October 19th - though our forces were small, we received your military support, which was most welcome. Your incomparable devoted efforts have been reported to our lord. Asahina Yazaburō will convey further information. With fear and respect, humbly stated.
　　November 11th　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sōzui
　　　　　　　　Lord Date Kurando-no-jō"

Among these, the document signed "Sōzui," upon gradual investigation, strangely appears to have already been included in a book called "Mikawa Old Documents," so it seems to have been known to the world previously. And the earlier document by Ujichika

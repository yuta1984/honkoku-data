◉Sakai Tadatsugu and the Retainers of Eastern Mikawa

**The Beginning of Ieyasu Appointing Retainers as Castle Lords** As explained in the previous chapter, Yoshida Castle came under Ieyasu's control in the third month of Eiroku 8, and Ieyasu granted it to his retainer Sakai Tadatsugu. The "Tokugawa Jitsuki" states regarding this matter: "This was the beginning of our house appointing retainers as castle lords for the first time."

**Honda Hirotaka** Before this, Ieyasu had Honda Bungo-no-kami Hirotaka attack Tahara Castle, and at this point the castle garrison's strength was exhausted and they likewise surrendered the castle. At that time, Asahina Higo-no-kami Mototomo served as the Imagawa clan's castle deputy at Tahara Castle, and according to the "Toda Family Genealogy Correction Supplement," a donation document by this person dated the ninth day of the second month of Eiroku 8 remains in the house of the Kanada family, who are the head priests of Tahara Shinmei Shrine. If this is indeed true, then Tahara Castle's surrender must have occurred after that date, so I believe it ultimately followed the surrender of Tahara Castle.

**Tahara Castle's Surrender** Tahara Castle, along with the fortresses of Kaji and Nisaki, was granted to Honda Hirotaka, but the Makino Narisada and Makino Sadashige group from Ushikubo also openly submitted to Ieyasu, and all other retainers of eastern Mikawa likewise submitted to him, so the entire province of Mikawa became unified under Ieyasu's control for the first time. Therefore, Sakai Tadatsugu established his base at Yoshida Castle, became the leader in eastern Mikawa, and exercised command. He first repaired Yoshida Castle and also organized the urban districts.

**Bridging the Toyo River** Moreover, he built the first bridge over the Toyo River, and I believe the theory that this occurred in the first year of Genki (342 years ago) is correct. As you all know, the Genki era followed Eiroku, so Eiroku lasted twelve years, and its thirteenth year was the first year of Genki, making this bridge construction the sixth year after Tadatsugu came to Yoshida Castle. The bridge location at that time went from the present Sekiya area to Shimoji on the opposite bank, and this is recorded in the Hōreki 10 records of Ōaza Funamachi. The "Gomeiyō Kikigaki" and "Kōyō Gunkan" record that in the fourth month of Genki 2, Takeda Shingen of Kai invaded Mikawa and attacked Yoshida Castle. The "Gomeiyō Kikigaki" states that the Takeda forces advanced as far as the earthen bridge, while the "Kōyō Gunkan" records that the Takeda forces attacked the main gate with their entire army and also circled around to the rear approach. Comparing these accounts carefully, I believe this "earthen bridge" refers to the so-called rear approach and undoubtedly indicates the bridge over the Toyo River. This suggests that what Tadatsugu first built over the Toyo River was an earthen bridge, which must have already been completed before this battle, so the theory dating this bridge construction to the first year of Genki must be considered correct. Of course, as you know, the "Kōyō Gunkan" primarily records Takeda military tactics, and I question whether it should be completely trusted. However, I believe the aforementioned account provides valuable reference when compared with the "Gomeiyō Kikigaki," which is why I mention it here.

Tadatsugu also frequently managed and donated to local shrines and temples, and many ridge plaques and donation documents from him still remain today.

**Portrait Donated by Tadatsugu's Wife** Particularly among the temple treasures of Ryūnen-ji is a portrait of Tadatsugu's wife's mother that was donated by his wife. This is quite interesting and I believe it provides valuable historical reference. Originally, Tadatsugu's wife was a daughter of Matsudaira Kiyoyasu and sister of Hirotada, making her Ieyasu's aunt. She was known as Lady Kōju, but since Kiyoyasu had three wives, it's unclear which one was Lady Kōju's mother. Therefore, I cannot definitively identify the subject of this portrait at present, but I plan to investigate this matter in the future to clarify it. In any case, I believe it is extremely valuable.

**Satomura Shōha's Fuji Travel Record** On a somewhat different topic, there was a famous renga poet named Satomura Shōha. He died in the fourth month of Keichō 7 at age 79, and he wrote something called "Fuji Kikō" in Eiroku 10, which is a travel record of his journey down the Tōkaidō from Kyoto to view Mt. Fuji. It contains accounts of passing through areas where warfare was occurring in Owari, with military fires scorching the sky, making it quite valuable as reference material. It also contains a passage about Yoshida: "In the same province, the lord of Yoshida Castle is Sakai Saemon-no-jō, at the same Rinsen, bathing and viewing the mountain and sea scenery from the second floor..."

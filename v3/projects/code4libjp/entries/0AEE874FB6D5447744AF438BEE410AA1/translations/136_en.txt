Hōei 5, year of the rat, 10th month, 13th day [October 13, 1708] - Revised by village headmen of the twelve associated towns

In this way, during Narichika's era there were various administrative achievements worth noting, but as I mentioned before, Narichika succeeded as a boy of only nine years, so there must have been quite reliable people among his retainers who managed the administration. However, who exactly held this responsibility at the time is not entirely clear at present. Nevertheless, considering various sources, among the retainers of that time were people named Fujie Takeemon, Higuchi Ichizaemon, and Makino Hitoshi, so it seems likely that among these people there was suitable talent who undertook this duty. Thus, in the first month of Hōei 6 [January 1709], Shogun Tsunayoshi died, and the sixth shogun Ienobu succeeded him and was appointed Seii Taishogun. Hōei was changed to Shōtoku in its eighth year, and on July 12 of its second year [July 12, 1714], Narichika was transferred to Nobeoka Castle in Hyūga Province. At this time Narichika was fourteen years old, and father and son together had been lords of this Yoshida for merely eight years. The one who came to this Yoshida Castle to replace this Makino clan was Matsudaira Izunokami Nobutoki, ancestor of the present Ōkōchi Viscount family. Therefore, from now on I would like to gradually describe matters concerning this Ōkōchi family, but I would also like to briefly mention here about Dohi Nizō.

⦿ Dohi Nizō

The person called Dohi Nizō is famous in tea ceremony circles, but it is truly regrettable that reliable and detailed biographical material about him cannot be obtained. However, this person was a retainer of the Makino clan mentioned in the previous chapter, and while the Makino clan was stationed at Yoshida, he naturally lived in this area. At that time he lost his only son and developed a desire for retirement, eventually resigning his position, shaving his head, and going into retirement at Okazaki in Kyoto - this is fact. The main outline is found in Ban Kōkei's "Kinsei Kijin-den" (Biographies of Modern Eccentrics), which I think is what people are most familiar with, so I will excerpt it below.

(Kinsei Kijin-den) Nizō's common name was Dohi Magobei (the notation "Toki" in tea ceremony signature collections is incorrect). He served the Makino lord of Mikawa Province Yoshida domain with a stipend of 200 koku. Having lost his only son, he suddenly developed a desire for retirement and resigned from service, shaving his head. When people heard of this quickly and sent letters, when replying through others, "My previous name is no longer suitable; what shall be the priest's name?" "Well, there is no name yet." "Whether two or three, it matters not," and when "Nizō" (Two-Three) was written, "This is a good name," so he adopted it. Later he lived at Okazaki in the capital, calling his dwelling Jizai-ken (Self-sufficient Hermitage), barely large enough to accommodate one's knees.

From this came the name of his hermitage. In tea he learned the Oda style and also loved incense. He recited the Tale of the Heike and was moreover skillful at biwa. He usually wore surprisingly fine clothing, but once when asked why he carried old geta tied with rope, he said "I'm returning them to the person who lent them." He paid no attention to worldly matters and had no fixed place of residence. Suddenly coming

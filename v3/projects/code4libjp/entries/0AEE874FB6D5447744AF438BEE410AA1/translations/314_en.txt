and returned to Yoshida in consternation via that route. Kojima Kansō was of course among them, and there exists something he wrote, entrusting his impressions of that time to a dream. This is indeed good material not only for understanding Kansō's thoughts but also for examining the circumstances of that time. However, the person himself kept this secret throughout his life. After his death, I fortunately had the opportunity to borrow and read it, so with the consent of his successor, I wish to make it public below. I believe it is important for our Toyohashi city history.

(Kojima Kansō's Dream Story)

"Recently, being idle one night on duty, I leaned on a chair and fell asleep. Suddenly someone unknown called out frantically, saying 'The shogun has lost his position, lost his position!' And also said, 'Everyone in the hall, take your swords and die with honor! How can you alone sleep peacefully?' I woke with a start and answered, 'The shogun's resignation is a wise decision. How many days from now until the appointed day of Sekigahara? In general, matters have front and back, and situations have reality and falsehood. You gentlemen, quickly taking your swords and dying with honor is very good, very good. I will sleep a while longer and consider the inner reality. Later I shall combine the outer reality to tailor good clothes. Until then, gentlemen should not tire yourselves by standing. However, what do you think about the inner cotton? Do not spoil the cutting of the outer layer,' and so forth. When the exchange was finished, that person looked up to heaven and laughed loudly. Therefore I awoke with a start, the lamp was dim and mice were scurrying, there was no one around - it was all a dream. Reflecting vaguely on the content of the dream speech, empty theories and rash judgments naturally often touch on taboos, which is extremely frightening. If there should be someone who might report this, how could I face interrogation in the future? The situation is not entirely clear. Therefore I have listed the points and added notes, carefully recording this and storing it in my box. Written and completed by Gauga Sanjin in a humble thatched hut on a certain day of a certain month of Keiō 3."

Question: Also, is the general restoration of government an wise decision?
Answer: Tension and relaxation are the way of both civil and military affairs.

Secretly considering: Since the imperial visit to the capital in previous years, although sincere remorse was expressed, in reality it was outward compliance but inner abandonment, directing resentment exclusively toward Satsuma, Chōshū and others. In addition, the Aizu domain was obstinate and stubborn, exclusively expanding bakufu authority - perhaps this was also a matter of political expediency. From the affair of desertion and violent outbreaks, apologizing but not achieving successful defense of Chōshū, the momentum of asserting authority reached its extreme. It was like drawing a bow to its fullest and holding it there - even when forcibly released, the arrow's power is weak. However, in the situation where short weapons cut into close quarters, if clumsy actions are taken at this time, not only will the Tokugawa house suffer strange harm, but the imperial nation as a whole will fall into barbarian schemes. As the proverb says, in this world the strong win, and the strong are favored. Now, with two-thirds of the territorial strength, temporarily relaxing with humility and deference

and embracing such virtue, then taking the path of fairness and righteousness - this would indeed cause not only unexpected confusion among them, but the allegiance of outer domains and the resolve of hereditary retainers would begin from this. I believe this would be the opportunity for Tokugawa revival. Ultimately, being mired only in the bakufu's traditional old customs, speaking only of intentions and authority, temporarily abandoning barbarian insults, somehow trying to expand empty authority even by forcing domestic matters. Originally, while speaking of sincere hearts maintaining righteousness, during this time of focusing on external troubles, unexpectedly falling into shallow knowledge and partiality, instead going against the direction of nationwide indignation, unable to take the path of broad magnanimity. In the end, falling into this general situation - ultimately, to whom should this sin be attributed? However, one should not blame only the violence of Satsuma and Chōshū. It should be known that there were many mistakes of literary complacency and military pleasure among hereditary retainers and direct retainers. Of course, the principle of taking by force and maintaining through virtue, with authority and benevolence alternating, is the secret strategy of military government. Originally, regarding the incident of desertion and violent outbreak, while there was much merit in Aizu domain's support of the bakufu, not only was the punitive expedition unsuccessful, but from Kii domain on down, hereditary retainers and direct retainers all lingered without advancing, failing to achieve success. How regrettable!

If this situation continues to be maintained, with right and wrong confused and internal and external worries and exhaustion, it will become increasingly unbearable.

Secretly considering: Revering the emperor and expelling barbarians is the public way of the realm, while respecting gods and treating foreigners gently is the bakufu's deep strategy. However, public opinion is easy to understand while deep strategy is difficult to discern. Ugly barbarians worrying the country is the common feeling of all domains, and the origins of desertion and violent outbreaks are extremely difficult to understand clearly. With foreign barbarian arrogance unified and increasing, there is no time when nationwide suspicions can be unified. The bakufu forms an isolated position. Taking responsibility for defending key positions throughout the divine land with the solitary strength of one leader out of eight hundred, at a time when the tail is too big to wag and exhaustion is unbearable, several major domains in temporary frenzy advocate the path of fairness and righteousness, raising the banner of revering the emperor and expelling barbarians first. From the circumstances where heavenly way's right and wrong are sometimes unproven, and public opinion and deep strategy's comprehension varies in difficulty, should they seize righteousness while we bear the burden of wrongness, the allegiance of the court and various domains would indeed be difficult to calculate - the roots of the Hōhei rebellion and the repeated mistakes of Keinin need not be mentioned. Foreign barbarians will certainly seize the opportunity to support this and that. The bakufu territories scattered across sixty provinces - their gradual erosion starting from this would undoubtedly be clumsy. Due to several domains' mutual frenzy, the divine land as a whole would fall into barbarian schemes. Even so, as the theory of revering the emperor and expelling barbarians becomes increasingly popular while the strategy of respecting gods and treating foreigners gently ceases and its achievements do not appear, being blamed by the court for the crime of ineffective current measures, being reproached by foreign barbarians for the reputation of breaking agreements and losing faith, being suspected by various domains for the fault of internal and external inappropriateness, and being resented by all people for the suffering of lives in misery - would this not fall upon the Tokugawa house alone?

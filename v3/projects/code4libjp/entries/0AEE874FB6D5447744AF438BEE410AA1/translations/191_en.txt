Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Ōta Kinjō and Nobuaki) 356

**Main Text:**

The military formation for this occasion was quite large-scale, and Nobuaki served as what could be called the supreme commander. Detailed records of the situation at that time still remain today. At this time, Nobuaki received a jinbaori (military vest) from the shogun as a reward, which everyone considered a great honor, so I would like to outline this matter here as well. And there is one final matter I wish to discuss: the fact that Nobuaki possessed deep loyalty to the emperor.

**Nobuaki's Imperial Loyalty**
Naturally, it goes without saying that our people's loyalty to the emperor runs deep, but during the Tokugawa period, in their desire for the long prosperity of the Tokugawa military fortune, there were occasions when people's imperial loyalty was sometimes questioned. For example, in the case of Sadanobu during the Imperial Title Incident, he appeared to go against the court's wishes at the time. However, this Sadanobu was actually deeply devoted to imperial loyalty, and his intentions were frequently demonstrated in his actions. Nobuaki too was a person of profound imperial loyalty. Of course, given the times and his position as a Tokugawa administrator, I believe he prayed for peace throughout the realm while also hoping for the long military fortune of the Tokugawa house. At the same time, there are facts that prove he had deep respect for the imperial court. I have already mentioned two or three examples of this before, and I have recently discovered in Nobuaki's poetry clear expressions of these sentiments. I would like to cite specific examples and discuss them in detail, but time does not permit today, so I will limit myself to this general outline. However, I wanted to establish this premise here.

**⦿Ōta Kinjō and Nobuaki**

There are still many things I could say about Nobuaki's character and achievements, but having roughly covered the above points, I would now like to discuss Ōta Kinjō.

**Ōta Kinjō**
The famous Confucian scholar Ōta Kinjō was another person whom Nobuaki originally discovered and promoted from obscurity. Nobuaki employed this man as a Confucian official of the Yoshida domain. Originally, Kinjō was born in Daishōji in Kaga Province. His father was called Genkan, a man of extensive learning and strong memory who was well-versed in yin-yang and herbal studies, serving the Maeda lords of Daishōji domain for generations. This man married into the Kashida family and had eight children, of whom Kinjō was the youngest son. Kinjō too showed exceptional intelligence from childhood—at age five he could already distinguish between the characters for "shi" (warrior) and "tsuchi" (earth), at eleven he was composing poetry, and at thirteen he was lecturing on the classics and histories, earning him the reputation of a child prodigy in his hometown.

As you know, it's generally believed that those called child prodigies rarely achieve great success later in life. However, Kinjō was a great exception to this common saying. As he matured, he developed what we might call worldly ambitions, and eventually obtained his father's permission to go to Kyoto, later moving to Edo where he studied under renowned Confucian scholars of the time such as Minagawa Kien and Yamamoto Hokuzan.

However, finding himself unsatisfied, he resolved to seek learning from the ancients, and thereafter read through countless volumes, gaining great enlightenment. Being a person of such temperament, he tended to be proud and harbor unconventional ideas, never stooping to serve others carelessly. Of course, seeking recognition among the daimyo was unthinkable for him, so he lived in considerable adversity, struggling with poverty. There are stories that at one time he worked as a massage therapist to make ends meet.

At that time, there was a bakufu physician named Taki Keizan who was broadly learned and well-informed, but also deeply loved scholars. He particularly respected Kinjō's talent and learning, and had him teach his children. At that time, Zhu Xi learning was considered orthodox, and other schools were viewed as somewhat heretical. Despite heated debates among scholars, Kinjō steadfastly maintained his own beliefs, developing what could be called an eclectic scholarly perspective.

It was during this period that he came to Nobuaki's attention. According to one account, Keizan recommended him to Nobuaki. Thus Nobuaki invited Kinjō to the Yoshida domain with the courtesy due to an honored guest, having him lecture on the classics to the heir Nobunari. However...

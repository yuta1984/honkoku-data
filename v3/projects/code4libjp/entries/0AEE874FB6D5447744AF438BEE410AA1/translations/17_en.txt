　　　　　　and this eventually became Yoshida, then Toyohashi, reaching today's situation.
　　　　　　　●Supplement　In the 'Shoku Nihongi,' Emperor Shōmu, Tenpyō 12, 6th month, it records that Mure no Ōno and Akumi no Korahi committed crimes, but Muraoka's 'Nihon Chiri Shiryō' states that this Mure refers to Muro in Atsumi District, and that Akumi refers to the ancient name Akumi of this place. If this is correct, then the place name Akumi existed 1,272 years ago as evidence. I would like to add this here for your reference.
　　　　　　 What I have described above can be considered the origin of Imahashi, but now, what kind of governance did this region originally receive?
Shrine Territory　　From ancient times it was shrine territory of the Grand Shrine of Ise. This shrine territory came to be usurped by warrior families during the Warring States period.
　　　　　　 Currently this region has numerous Shinmei shrines. This is entirely the result of formerly being shrine territory. Also, within present-day Toyohashi city there was a place called Hajikami from ancient times. This corresponds exactly to what is now called Nirengi area,
Hajikami Place Name　　and the character name Hajikami still remains today. That this Hajikami, along with Akumi, Hada, and others were anciently shrine territory of the Grand Shrine of Ise
　　　　　　 is evident in records about the Grand Shrine such as the 'Shinpōshō,' as well as the 'Daijingū Zatsureishū,' and of course the 'Azuma Kagami' and 'Ujitsune-ki,' but
　　　　　　 it would not be very necessary to describe this in detail here.
　　　　　　 Now, regarding the exact period when the place name Imahashi originated, unfortunately there is no evidence to prove
　　　　　　this, so it cannot be stated clearly. There are many writings that record this matter, but it is regrettable that none are reliable enough to trust. However, what I think has some value for reference is the ancient records of Goshин-ji temple, and this writing appears to have been recorded during the Jōkyō-Genroku period. I observed this from the fact that the entries from the beginning of this book to around Genroku are all written with the same handwriting and same ink color, and in this book
《Interlinear note: Establishment of Jōgyō-in》　　　it records that the monk Zenshū came to the land of eastern Mikawa, arrived at Imahashi, and in Teiji 5 first established a temple called Jōgyō-in. This is the origin of the present-day

　　　　　　 Goshin-ji temple. Teiji 5 is a Northern Court era name corresponding to Shōhei 21 of the Southern Court (522 years ago), and regarding the establishment of this temple in that year, there remains separate irrefutable evidence. This is a portrait of the monk Zenshū in Goshin-ji's possession, authenticated as genuinely from that period. Its inscription contains the eulogy: "Hōgyō manmoku jin kakai chi jū u san kyaku takesai zai ji shunjū man sanjū tengen fudō chi kaikai kō Ōei ni reki hachigatsu nijūhachinichi." From this we can understand that Goshin-ji's founder Zenshū died in Ōei 2, having been at the temple for thirty years. Since thirty years back from Ōei 2 corresponds to Teiji 5, it becomes certain that the monk first established the temple at this location in that year. However, whether this place was already called Imahashi at that time, as stated in Goshin-ji's old records, is somewhat difficult to determine definitively.
《Interlinear note: Second Abbot Jichi's Donated Sutras》　　　However, there was a sutra text that the temple's second abbot Jichi donated to Mitsu Shrine in Hōi District. Its colophon states "Finished copying on the 29th day of the 12th month of Ōei 16 at Goshin-ji temple, Imahashi, Sanshū." Ōei 16 was 503
　　　　　　 years ago, and this is important for our Toyohashi, but regrettably that sutra text no longer exists. However, when Hadano Takao conducted field research during his lifetime, he apparently saw the actual item, as can be inferred not only from articles in his posthumous works but also because Yamamoto Teishin of Shimoji-chō, Hōi District, included a copy in his 'Yoshida Meishō Sōroku,' so that sutra text certainly once existed. I also recently investigated the same shrine and found there are indeed more than thirty volumes of donated sutras from before Ōei period, which are truly precious. Among them some are 70-80% decayed and completely tattered.
　　　　　　From this we can consider that the important sutra text for Toyohashi probably also decayed. This is truly regrettable, but in any case, we can definitely conclude that over 500 years ago, during the time of Goshin-ji's second abbot, this place was clearly called Imahashi. Later, in Eikyō 4, 9th month (480 years ago), Shogun Ashikaga Yoshi-

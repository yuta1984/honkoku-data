**《Relations between Kozan and Takao》** ...escaped such calamities. Because of these circumstances, during Kozan's residence in Yoshida, he formed a close friendship with Takao and others, finding their spirits completely in harmony. At that time, Kozan was confined in Yoshida as I mentioned before, but after the Sakuradamon Incident, his restrictions were gradually relaxed, and before long he was moved to one building of what was called the Ōte Nagaya (Main Gate Row Houses) located in what is now Hatchō. Initially, a foot-soldier inspector still kept watch overnight, and meetings were permitted only with samurai class members. However, this too gradually relaxed until eventually anyone could meet with him freely. Later he was moved to a house on the south side of what is now Nishi-Hatchō, where even today a large pine tree still stands along the street. He was eventually permitted to bring his wife and children to live with him. During that time, Kozan called his residence "Shōsei Yūkyo" (Pine Voice Hermitage) and styled himself "Ansai."

**Ritual Worship of Kusunoki Masashige:** Also at that time, he established a shrine to Kusunoki Masashige (Nankō) in his garden and worshipped there. When the restrictions on Kozan's confinement were relaxed, among the first to establish relations with him were Takao and others, who together advocated the principles of imperial loyalty and overthrowing the shogunate, finding their spirits extremely compatible. Therefore, when Kozan finally departed for Kyoto after the Restoration, he entrusted this shrine of Kusunoki to Takao. Takao raised funds from volunteers in the city, arranged for its renovation, moved it to his own garden, and continued the worship. This included a stone monument in Kozan's own calligraphy. Until recent years, these volunteers would gather in Takao's garden to conduct this ceremony, and even someone like myself, following in my late father's footsteps from childhood, participated in it every year. However, now for certain reasons it has been moved to Sakuraoka in the eastern part of the city, which I believe is something that deserves great attention for the future. There were many other instances where Kozan, Takao and others collaborated to honor filial sons and loyal servants, and to promote national customs. Since I plan to discuss these matters gradually in later chapters, I will refrain from going into detail about them here one by one. However, it must be said that the influence these people had on the moral atmosphere of our Yoshida was truly considerable. I believe I should also mention something here about the relationship between the townspeople of Yoshida and Kozan.

**Main Text:**
When Kozan's confinement was relaxed and anyone could meet with him, among the townspeople, the first to quickly seek relations with him was a physician named

**Kominami Setsuan:** This man's childhood name was Takeo, and his father was also called Setsuan. He was originally from Shimōsa Province and was also a doctor. However, on his way to Nagasaki for medical training, he settled in Yoshida and established a household there. He was quite a scholar and formed a close friendship with Ōta Seiken. His son Takeo was also a scholar following his father, and after his father's death, he inherited the name and was called Setsuan. He had many disciples in Chinese learning and poetry composition among the townspeople. People like Dr. Ōsawa Kenji, the late Suzuki Rinzō, Harada Mankyū, and Nagao Sankuzō also attended his Chinese learning classes. This Setsuan deeply admired Kozan and was foremost in seeking relations with him. This was initially a relationship between poets, but in any case, this became the starting point for establishing connections between the townspeople of Yoshida and Kozan. During that time, the imperial loyalist patriots who traveled east and west invariably visited Kozan's hermitage, and those who helped and protected these patriots were people like Takao and Hōu, while other townspeople also gradually drew closer to this cause. People like the late Kaneko Nanori and those still living such as Nagao Kayō and Ono Todō constantly visited the homes of both Kozan and Takao, providing assistance including financial support. Because of these circumstances, for the Kusunoki festival ceremonies I mentioned earlier, all these volunteers would gather at Kozan's residence. There is a poem that Takao composed in front of the shrine in 1869 (Meiji 2) when he was seventy-two years old:

Composed and respectfully offered at the sacred shrine of Lord Kusunoki Masashige on the grounds of the venerable Ono Kozan's residence:
The miraculous name of Kusuki
Spreads throughout the land below heaven
Like scattered flowers drifting across

And the discussion returns again to Takao, who also wrote various books. Among them were works on preparing for famines, sericulture...

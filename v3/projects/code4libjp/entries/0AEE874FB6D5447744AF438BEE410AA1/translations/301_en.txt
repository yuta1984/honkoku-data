[continued from previous page] but ultimately it was decided that Yoshinobu should retire from his official position and return his lands and people. However, this involved mediation by the three domains of Owari, Echizen, and Tosa, and was temporarily entrusted to the lords of Owari and Echizen. On that very day, the advance guard of Chōshū domain entered Kyoto, and on the 11th they were ordered to patrol inside and outside the nine gates. Furthermore, on the 27th, Prince Sanjō and other nobles who had been in exile were finally restored to office and entered Kyoto. Thus the anti-Tokugawa forces grew to towering proportions. At that time, Iwakura and others were determined that if the former shogun did not carry out his retirement and land surrender, the court should order the implementation of these measures from its side, and they had already prepared a draft. However, when these matters leaked out, his retainers and the domains of Aizu and Kuwana became increasingly indignant, and these forces showed their determination to attack the two domains of Satsuma and Chōshū. Although Yoshinobu made every effort to pacify them, they could not be easily calmed.

**Yoshinobu Withdraws to Osaka Castle**

Yoshinobu decided it would be better to temporarily withdraw to Osaka Castle, wait for popular sentiment to settle, and then return to Kyoto to petition for retirement and land surrender. He finally left Nijō Castle and went down to Osaka. However, the matter of returning official positions and territories became increasingly complicated, and discussions became more and more confused. Just when peaceful arguments seemed about to prevail in Osaka Castle, urgent news of the attack on the Satsuma residence from Edo once again aroused great anger.

**Attack on the Satsuma Residence in Edo**

This attack on the Satsuma residence was originally caused by the violent behavior of Satsuma domain retainers in Edo, and the domains responsible for security bombarded the residence on orders from the senior inspector to control them. However, some Satsuma rōnin escaped from the siege and fled to Satsuma ships anchored off Shinagawa, but shogunate ships also in Shinagawa Bay pursued them all the way to the entrance of Settsu Bay. This attack on the Satsuma residence occurred on the night of December 24th, and news of this reached Osaka on December 31st. At this point, even Osaka, which had once seemed inclined toward peace, was again filled with murderous intent, ultimately leading to the激成 [激成 appears to be an error - likely 激成 meaning "bringing about"] of the Battle of Fushimi-Toba.

[continuation] end.

As previously mentioned, peaceful arguments had temporarily gained the upper hand in Osaka, but all parties considered the court's recent measures to be biased, concluding that they were not true imperial will but certainly came from the conspiracies of the Satsuma rebels, and argued that the evil influences around the emperor must be quickly purged. Just on December 31st, Senior Inspector Takigawa Tomonori arrived in Osaka with troops from Edo and reported on the violent behavior of Satsuma retainers in Edo and the attack on their residence, so they immediately decided to go to Kyoto to undertake the purging of evil influences around the emperor.

**Yoshinobu Attempts to Go to Kyoto**

The dawn of Keiō 4 (later renamed Meiji) arrived. On New Year's Day, former Shogun Yoshinobu prepared his military forces intending to enter the court, planning to leave Osaka on the 2nd and enter Kyoto on the 3rd. He first sent Takigawa Tomonori ahead carrying a proclamation against Satsuma. Whether this action was truly Yoshinobu's intention is highly questionable, but

**Battle of Fushimi-Toba**

in any case, the shogunate army advanced along both the Fushimi and Toba routes at this time. However, this force clashed with the allied armies of Satsuma, Chōshū and others, and the shogunate army was ignominiously defeated—as you all already know, I need not elaborate on this. However, even the Satsuma-Chōshū side had not expected to achieve such a remarkable victory in this one battle. They had been prepared to escort the emperor via the San'in Road to Hiroshima, and had firmly resolved that no matter what difficulties they might encounter even if the war lasted for years, they must accomplish the great task of destroying the shogunate. This showed truly extraordinary determination.

However, Yoshinobu already recognized from this one battle that the situation was not in his favor, and even though he had not initiated hostilities, it was undeniable that this contradicted the principle of imperial reverence he had maintained from the beginning—he deeply regretted this.

**Yoshinobu Returns to Edo by Sea**

On the 6th he ordered all armies to withdraw to Osaka, and that night he secretly left the castle, boarded a small boat at Hakkenja, reached the offing of Tenpōzan, transferred to the Kaiyō warship the next day, and finally fled to Edo by sea.

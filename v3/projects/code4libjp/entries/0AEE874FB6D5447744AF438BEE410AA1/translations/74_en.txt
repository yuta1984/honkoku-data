[The theory states that] until the fourteenth day [Ieyasu] remained at Noda, but on the fifteenth day went to Okazaki to meet Nobunaga. This is not a theory that can be entirely rejected, but even if this were fact, those in Nagashino Castle at the time could not have known such detailed circumstances. Moreover, reading the accounts in "Mikawa Monogatari," "Matsudaira-ki," and other sources, it appears they believed that Ieyasu had come as far as the Noda area. That is, we must be convinced that Suneemon's purpose in leaving was first to meet Ieyasu and learn about Nobunaga's situation. In any case, I believe without doubt that saying Suneemon left the castle with the initial purpose of going to Okazaki is ultimately the source of error.

Now, on the sixteenth, Nobunaga immediately advanced his army from Okazaki and arrived at Ushikubo Castle, reaching Noda on the seventeenth. Despite Nobunaga's advice, Katsuaki wanted to inform the castle of this situation as quickly as possible, so he immediately left Okazaki on the night of the fifteenth, arrived near Nagashino Castle, and waited for an opportunity to approach the castle by mixing in among the Takeda forces' porters. However, he was finally discovered by Anayama forces and captured. Brought before Katsuyori, he was earnestly told by Katsuyori to persuade the castle defenders to give up and surrender to him. But Katsuaki pretended to comply with this instruction, and fortunately obtaining an opportunity to approach the castle, raised his voice loudly and shouted - as I mentioned before by quoting from "Mikawa Monogatari" - that Nobunaga and Ieyasu's reinforcements were approaching, so hold the castle firmly, and within three days there would surely be a path to victory. The Takeda forces were both surprised and angered, so they finally killed Katsuaki. There is also a theory that he was crucified at Shinobano, but in fact he was immediately stabbed to death on the spot, and I believe what is written in "Mikawa Monogatari" is indeed the truth:

"Since he speaks of the enemy's strength instead, quickly finish him off," and so they stabbed him to death.

[The Battle of Nagashino]
Thus on the eighteenth, both Nobunaga and Ieyasu positioned their forces at Shitarahara, with Nobunaga's particular design creating a strict defensive formation

by erecting long palisades, selecting marksmen from among the gunners and positioning them in the front ranks, and also placing gates of about thirty to fifty ken intervals between the long palisades to facilitate advances. The Takeda forces held a council of generals on the nineteenth to determine their attack strategy, on the twentieth Katsuyori himself led the entire army across the Takigawa, and on the twenty-first the battle between both armies finally commenced. At this time there is a theory that Katsuyori's favorites Nagasaka Kōkan and Atobe Ōinosuke were enticed by Nobunaga's general Sakuma Nobunaga with bribes, fell into his stratagem, and caused the Takeda forces to err in their strategy. However, the fact is that Nagasaka did not participate in this battle, and documentary evidence has already been discovered that makes this undeniable. I think this was also discussed when Scholar of Literature Watanabe Seisuke gave a lecture about Nagashino in Shinshiro town. In any case, in this battle the Oda and Tokugawa clans both exerted all possible strength, so their combined forces nearly tripled those of the Takeda, and especially as I mentioned before, they had large numbers of gunners, so it seems the outcome was already clear from this point.

[The Attack on Tobinoyama]
However, when Sakai Tadatsugu attacked the enemy fortifications at Tobinoyama on the night of the twentieth, one cannot know how much this broke the Takeda forces' morale. Therefore Tadatsugu was undoubtedly the greatest contributor to victory for the Oda-Tokugawa forces in this battle, and there is this story about it. Initially when Tadatsugu proposed this plan to attack Tobinosu to Nobunaga during a war council, Nobunaga was extremely angry and rejected it. However, after the war council ended and the generals withdrew, Nobunaga secretly called Ieyasu and Tadatsugu close to him and greatly praised the earlier proposal, immediately having it implemented. The reason he had pretended to reject it earlier was probably entirely due to fear that the plan might leak out. This sounds like it could be a fabricated story, but it appears in sources like "Kansei Chōshū Shokafū" and cannot be dismissed outright. This attack on Tobinosu achieved a remarkable surprise, with participants from the Oda side including Kanamori Gorōhachi Nagachika and Satō Rokuzaemon Norihide, and from the Tokugawa side Honda Bungo-no-kami Hirotaka, Matsudaira Tonomonosuke Koretada, Matsudaira Suhō-no-kami Yasuchika, Makino Shinjirō Yasunari, Suganuma Shinpachirō Sadamitsu, and Hon-

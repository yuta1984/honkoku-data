**Main Text:**
　　　　　　Yōdō went to the imperial envoy's residence and made various statements, ultimately deciding that while the shogunate had resolved to obey the imperial command regarding expulsion of foreigners, the timing and methods required the most careful deliberation, so no matter how much urging there was, this matter alone could not be decided hastily. Regarding the establishment of imperial troops, they held private discussions with the intention of providing a response at a later date. Originally, the role of escorting these imperial envoys fell to Tosa lord Matsudaira Toyonori (Yamauchi), who, as you know, was Yōdō's successor and was related by marriage to both the Sanjō and Mōri houses. From Chōshū, heir Mōri Sadahiro had already entered Edo in August of that year to mediate, so this time both Tosa and Chōshū domains took the lead. However, Chōshū's domain policy had initially favored a form of court-shogunate unity theory, and around May of last year (Bunkyū 1), Direct Inspector Nagai Uta, acting on domain orders, advocated his proposed theories of court-shogunate unity and maritime expansion in the Kyoto-Osaka region, eventually reaching the Emperor's ears. In December, he presented this to Senior Councilor Kuze Yamato-no-kami, and the shogunate was greatly pleased and inclined to rely heavily on Chōshū. However, this proposal later faced fierce opposition within the domain and was severely disliked by other domains, ultimately failing. Due to this, Nagai departed dejectedly for home on June 18th of this year (Bunkyū 2), and thereafter Chōshū completely transformed into a bastion of loyalist expulsion theory. However, as briefly mentioned before, in the Teradaya Incident that occurred in Fushimi on April 23rd of this year, unfortunate feelings arose between Satsuma and Chōshū domains. Particularly when Third Rank Ōhara came east as imperial envoy, Hisamitsu, who could be called Satsuma's domain father, served as his deputy and came to Edo, which likely caused even more displeasure in Chōshū. When Hisamitsu completed his deputy role and departed for home, Chōshū's influence immediately expanded in Kyoto, and this result became the motive for sending imperial envoys a second time, with their escort being entirely handled by Chōshū forces.

　　　　　　Now, the former Tosa lord Yōdō was a person who remained steadfastly committed to loyalist principles, yet also consistently maintained court-shogunate unity theory. Since he apparently did not necessarily desire to align with Satsuma and Chōshū domains, regarding this current matter he should be evaluated as having mediated most fairly and well. Since Chōshū also raised no objections to Yōdō's private proposal, the private discussions were decided accordingly. With Yōdō and Yoshinaga, as well as Matsudaira Toyonori, Mōri Sadahiro and others all working various mediations, Yoshinobu, who had once resolved to resign, was compelled to resolve himself again and rally to action. Thus on November 27th, the principal and deputy imperial envoys formally entered the castle and publicly transmitted the imperial edict. This day's ceremony was extremely elaborate, an unprecedented grand event since the establishment of shogunal government, and nothing had so clearly established the proper relationship between lord and retainer. The shogun responded to the imperial command on December 5th, but regarding the establishment of imperial troops mentioned previously, no matter how much he intended to be obedient, this could not coexist while the shogunate continued to exist, so he reluctantly declined this. However, regarding this matter, not only the imperial envoys but also Chōshū advocated zealously, with Sadahiro having already received imperial instructions in Kyoto before departure, so even when returning west he submitted a document to the shogunate arguing the necessity of establishing imperial troops.
　　　　　　Prior to this, on November 25th, the shogunate punished Ii Kamon-no-kami, Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami and other senior ministers from when Naosuke was chief minister, but both the guardian and president opposed this as untimely. However, Senior Councilor Ogasawara Zusho-no-kami's zealous advocacy, urged on by the imperial envoy's party, ultimately led to its implementation, and this too seems to have become a circumstance hastening the decline of the Tokugawa shogunate.
　　　　　　Moreover, the situation in Kyoto at that time increasingly brought the zenith of the loyalist expulsion party, and the shogunate's real power became completely transparent to the world, so it became necessary to gradually establish institutions to concentrate political and military authority in Kyoto

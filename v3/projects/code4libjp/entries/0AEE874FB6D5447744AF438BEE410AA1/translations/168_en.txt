Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Matsudaira Nobunao and the People of His Era) 310

**Main Text:**
His Chinese studies teacher was the famous Miura Chikukei, and since Chikukei's character was as I described before, Nobunao must have studied with considerable diligence and perseverance. Even now, the Ōkōchi family preserves many volumes of Chinese classics annotated in his own hand, with careful annotations added to every difficult passage and written with strict precision, showing clearly how steadily and earnestly he pursued his studies. Daily study schedules from that time also remain, which Nobunao himself created to set daily study times and subjects for self-discipline. When compared with the character of his teacher Chikukei, this becomes a truly interesting topic. Nobunao was also skilled in poetry and painting. Several examples of his calligraphy are preserved by the family, and they are by no means the typical amateurish works of a lord. The Ōkōchi family genealogy records the following about Nobunao, which I think gives us a good overview of his character:

"In daily life he found pleasure in poetry, calligraphy, painting, and playing the koto. He greatly loved ancient music and was especially skilled at the horizontal flute. In his youth he studied under Taira Yoshikata (a disciple of Ogyū Sorai), researching the Six Classics and comprehensively studying ancient prose styles of thirteen schools and widely reading works of a hundred schools. He was expert in history, having studied twenty-one historical works, but stopped at the Song History due to illness. Even when seriously ill, he never set books aside. His works include the Kyōjō Collection (6 volumes), Revision Collection (2 volumes), Prose Collection (1 volume), Poetry Collection (5 volumes), Waka Collection (20 volumes), and Musical Score Collection (2 volumes). His governance was peaceful and quiet, and the samurai and common people lived in harmony. On the day of his death, the entire domain mourned as if losing their own parents. Those who wished to escort his coffin to Edo numbered over 300 people, though officials limited it to 60 for the journey, which became a beautiful tribute."

Among the above, Taira Yoshikata refers to Miura Chikukei, but I regret that I have not yet had the opportunity to examine Nobunao's writings mentioned above.

I would also like to discuss one or two figures who appeared in this region during this era. Since I have already discussed Miura Chikukei, I will set that aside and speak of Hayashi Yajizaemon, a townsman of Yoshida who is somewhat worth mentioning. This person served as an elder of Yoshida town and also as headman of Togi-machi and Nakaseko. His formal name was Masamori and his literary name was Jiken. His ancestor was Hayashi Jūzaemon Kagemasa, who was skilled in archery and distinguished himself by defending the Akumi entrance when Takeda Shingen attacked this region in Genki 3 (1572), for which he was rewarded by the castle commander Sakai Tadatsugu, as mentioned...

...as I already mentioned in the previous chapter. His younger brother, Sukebei Masahide, served Ikeda Terumasa and died in battle at Nagakute, but his descendants eventually came to reside in Yoshida, according to their family tradition. The Masamori we are discussing is said to be the sixth-generation descendant of that Masahide. However, he was now merely a townsman, but a most devoted person who independently authored a work called "Records of Sanshū Yoshida." Its preface is dated September of Kan'en 3 (1750), and for a townsman to research such matters at that time must have taken considerable years. Though it may not be particularly valuable by today's standards, it contains many passages that serve as useful references.

This man was quite enthusiastic in researching old events and historical sites. He was the one who erected a monument to Makino Kohaku at the founder's tomb of Ryūnen Temple, and a copy of that inscription is still preserved at the temple. However, it is regrettable that the actual monument no longer exists. He also published one or two other books, all essays, but it is unfortunate that almost none survive today.

In connection with this, I would like to mention that Masamori's uncle was a monk named Kyōshun. This person was the thirteenth son of Masamori's grandfather Yajizaemon Kageshina - unusually, there were many male siblings. As a child he entered Fumon Temple in Akumi District's Kumo-no-tani, became a monk and served as its head priest for a time, then later went to Mount Kōya where he became head of Hokuhō-in and rose to the rank of Daikyōsei. He died on December 12th of Hōreki 1 (1751) at age eighty-three, and was renowned for his great learning. His calligraphy is still preserved at the home of Hayashi Sahei in Funa-machi, his descendant, and shows a most otherworldly style.

I would like to add one more related story about the famous book "Mikawa-no-kuni Futaba-matsu." This book was completed during the Gembun era (1736-1741), precisely during the time when Matsudaira Bungo-no-kami Sukenori was residing in the castle. Its author was Sano Kenmotsu from Nagayama village in Hōi District, with additions by Ogasawara Daini from within Yoshida Castle, Watanabe Taihaku from Dōta-machi, and four others. Among these collaborators was Ushiku...

Shingen's Retreat: Shingen found himself facing enemies on all four sides and had no choice but to secretly withdraw his army to Kōshū on the night of the 27th day of the fourth month of the following year. However, the Hōjō clan's methods were quite skillful - they made Ujimasa's son Ujinao the adopted son of Imagawa Ujizane, arranging it so that the territory would naturally fall into their hands. They also placed Ujizane in Numazu Castle under their surveillance.

The Hōjō Occupy Suruga: In summary, the Takeda clan's recent campaign had ended up allowing the Tokugawa to take Tōtōmi and letting the Hōjō reap the benefits of being fishermen, while they themselves had completely failed. It was natural that they could not remain silent about this. So in the sixth month of Eiroku 12, Shingen again led troops and invaded the eastern part of Suruga. In late eighth month, he further advanced from Saku District to western Kōzuke, entered Musashi, and in the tenth month finally approached Odawara, setting fires in the nearby villages of Isshiki and Sakawa. However, Ujiyasu and Ujimasa, father and son, had already experienced Kenshin's invasion, so they did not come out to fight. Moreover, for Shingen, attacking Odawara was not the objective - it was ultimately a diversionary tactic for invading Suruga. So before long he returned his troops to Kai, but in the eleventh month immediately sent troops to Suruga again to attack the Hōjō's subsidiary castles.

Shingen Conquers Various Castles in Suruga: This approach was steadily successful - he continued to capture Fuchū, took Kanbara Castle, and in the following first year of Genki advanced further to attack Hanazawa Castle in Shida District. In this castle, as mentioned before, Ohara Hizen-no-kami Shigesane was stationed at that time. However, he too could not possibly hold out, so Shigesane abandoned the castle and fled. Subsequently, castles such as Fujieda, Tokuno, and Isshiki also fell under Shingen's occupation. Shingen then repaired Fujieda Castle, renamed it Tanaka Castle, and had Baba Nobufusa guard it. He further built a castle at Ejiri and stationed Yamagata Masakage there. In this manner, within a short time, most of Suruga Province came under Shingen's control, so the Ujiyasu father and son at Odawara not only had no time to rescue it but also continuously requested aid from Kenshin. However, whether because the snow was still deep at that time or for other reasons, Kenshin ultimately did not move a single soldier. Thus the Takeda and Tokugawa clans

naturally came to face each other again across the Ōi River.

Shingen Invades Tōtōmi: At this point, Shingen was finally ready to invade Tōtōmi and Mikawa to test the Tokugawa clan's capabilities. For this, he first needed to threaten the Hōjō clan to sufficiently weaken their power in order to reduce concerns about the rear. So in the fourth month of Genki 1, he invaded Izu, besieged Nirayama Castle, faced off with Ujimasa at Mishima, and then withdrew his forces. After this, he finally sent troops into Tōtōmi - this was the route by which Shingen first came to invade Mikawa. The sequence of his invasion was as follows: first, in the second month of Genki 2, he sent out troops to build castles at Koyama and Sagara in Tōtōmi; in the third month he advanced to attack Tokugawa general Ogasawara Nagatada at Takatengjin Castle, while on the other hand organizing a naval force to attack Kaketsuka at the mouth of the Tenryū River.

Takeda Forces Raid Mikawa: In the fourth month, he incited local soldiers of Tōtōmi to enter western Mikawa, threatening the two castles of Iwazu and Okazaki. Then leading troops from Shinshū, he entered the western part of Mikawa, first capturing Asuke Castle, then turning east and moving south from the Tsukude area to raid Noda, Ushikubo, Nagasawa, and Rengi, finally approaching Yoshida Castle. Prior to this, in the first month of Genki 1, the new castle at Hamamatsu had been completed, and Ieyasu had moved there from Okazaki, placing his son Nobuyasu in Okazaki Castle.

Battle of Anegawa: In the sixth month of that year, the famous Battle of Anegawa took place, so at Oda Nobunaga's request, not only Ieyasu but also many Tokugawa generals including Sakai Tadatsugu participated and all distinguished themselves with special merit. Of course, at that time Takeda Shingen was, as mentioned before, exactly at the time when he had invaded Izu and was facing off with the Hōjō forces, so he had no time to observe what followed.

The Mountain Clans of Three Districts Join the Takeda: Now that Shingen himself was about to invade Mikawa, he first had Akiyama Nobutomo and others from Tōtōmi recruit the mountain people of the three districts in northern eastern Mikawa. So except for the Suganuma clan of Noda and Suganuma Sadauji's branch, all others including Okudaira Michifumi and the Suganuma clan betrayed the Tokugawa and joined the Takeda. Through the guidance of these people, he finally came to threaten Yoshida Castle.

Shingen Approaches Yoshida Castle: At this time, Toda Yasunaga, lord of Rengi Castle, was still called Torachiyo and was only ten years old, but Toda Yoshikuni served as deputy commander

Evening of the 18th day     Ryūsenin

In the above letter, "Kamechiyo" refers to Nobutoki in his childhood years, and "Ukyō" refers to Ukyōdayū Terusada (of the Ōkōchi clan from Takaki period), which is of course clear, but "Dewa" I believe refers to Yanagisawa Dewanokami Yasuaki. Moreover, the sweets and sake-lees pickles received from that household were sent from Edo to Koga with the note "since I received these from Lord Dewa, I am sending them to you." The sentiment behind this is truly admirable, and the affection between mother and child has an indescribable warmth to it.

Now, after Nobuteru, his son Nobutoki succeeded him, and this person was the very first to be transferred to this Yoshida domain, so from the next chapter onward, I would like to continue from before and describe Yoshida during the Nobutoki era in proper sequence.

**● Matsudaira Nobutoki and His Era**

**Matsudaira Nobutoki** As mentioned in the previous chapter, Matsudaira Nobutoki was Nobuteru's eldest son, and his mother was the daughter of Inoue Nakatsukasa-shōyū Masatō. He was born in Musashi on the 6th day of the 11th month of Tenna 3, with the childhood name Kamechiyo. On the 9th day of the 8th month of Genroku 6, when he was eleven years old, he was first given the name Nobutaka. A recommendation document written by the Head of the University (Hayashi Daigaku-no-kami) for selecting this name still remains today, as follows:

Name to be used:
Nobutaka     Opposing the character for "ship"
Genroku 6, year of the Water Ox, 8th month, auspicious day     Recommended by Daigaku-no-kami Hayashi Nobuatsu

Subsequently, on the 18th day of the 12th month of Genroku 10, he was appointed to junior fifth rank, lower grade, and governor of Kai Province. On the 18th day of the 6th month of Hōei 6, when his father Nobuteru was granted permission to retire, Nobutoki immediately succeeded him and was granted Koga Castle with seventy thousand koku. Indeed, his father Nobuteru appears to have been of naturally weak constitution, and until then Nobutoki had frequently served as his father's representative in official duties due to his father's illness. Now that he had finally inherited the family headship, on the 21st day of that month, Nobutoki was further renamed as Izunokami.

**The Genroku Era** Now, what were the circumstances of the Tokugawa period at that time? Here I must describe this matter somewhat, as it has become necessary to do so. As you know, the fifth shogun Tsunayoshi was naturally fond of learning, and while there were certainly demands of the times involved, when he first became shogun, he steadily reformed various policies and greatly promoted the flourishing of literature. As I have mentioned repeatedly, not only did he undertake historical compilation projects during the Tokugawa period, but he also promulgated the new calendar. Hayashi Nobuatsu (Hōkō) in particular gained his greatest trust, and this Confucian official, who had previously worn Confucian robes and maintained a monk-like appearance, finally grew his hair and became junior fifth rank, lower grade, Head of the University, and the revision of the Mikawa-ki (Chronicle of Mikawa) and compilation of the Butoku Taisei-ki (Great Chronicle of Military Virtues) were all accomplished by this man. Furthermore, Tsunayoshi built the Taisei-den hall to promote Confucian learning and also had national studies taught, so scholars like Kitamura Suehaki, Keichū, and the Ajari emerged at this time. Among civilian literary figures, the likes of Chikamatsu Monzaemon, Ihara Saikaku, and Matsuo Bashō also appeared in succession, resulting in the flourishing of literary culture, which I believe you are all well aware of. Moreover, Tsunayoshi's attitude toward Kyoto was quite deferential, as seen in his revival of the Daijōsai ceremony and repairs to imperial mausoleums, showing no small degree of sincere devotion. For such reasons, the harmony between court and military government was quite perfect, and the realm was truly at peace. However, when observed from behind the scenes, things did not go nearly as well as they appeared on the surface, and there were actually many corrupt policies on the other hand. First, customs became luxurious and fell into licentiousness, displaying the true character of the so-called Genroku era

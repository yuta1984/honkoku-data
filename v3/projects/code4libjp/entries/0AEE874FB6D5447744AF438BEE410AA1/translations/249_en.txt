◉The Ansei Purge and Ono Kozan

Under the circumstances described in the previous chapter, on June 20th of Ansei 5 (1858), the shogunate found itself compelled by unavoidable circumstances to sign the treaty with America, but of course imperial permission for this had not yet been obtained. Therefore, regarding this matter, Great Elder Ii Kammon-no-kami found himself in the position of taking full responsibility upon himself, but of course it would not do to leave matters with just submitting a single memorial explaining the situation, so the shogunate decided to send newly appointed Senior Councilor Manabe Noriatsu to Kyoto.

**Manabe Noriatsu's Journey to Kyoto**
However, in Kyoto as well, the previous memorial had caused debate to boil over even more intensely, and as a result imperial orders were transmitted urging the Three Houses or the Great Elder to come to Kyoto. But at that time the shogun's illness was becoming increasingly serious and no one knew when something might happen, so it was of course impossible to permit the Great Elder to travel to Kyoto. Therefore the shogunate explained the actual situation to Kyoto and arranged for Senior Councilor Manabe to make the journey as described above.

**The Death of Shogun Iesada**
However, prior to his departure, Shogun Iesada finally passed away, so naturally Noriatsu's journey to Kyoto was also postponed.

Now, regarding the situation in Kyoto, the various court nobles including Prince Shōren'in, Former Interior Minister Sanjō, Grand Minister Takatsukasa, Minister of the Left Konoe, and the Great Counselors Nakayama and Ōgimachi were greatly angered by the shogunate's arbitrary signing of the treaty and considered this precisely a violation of imperial orders, holding consultations day and night. However, only Regent Kujō served as a bridge between the court and the shogunate, working considerably to mediate between them, and for this he was severely ostracized by the other court nobles, with even his position becoming precarious.

**Imperial Edicts Granted to Mito and the Shogunate**
During this period considerable turmoil ensued, but around August 7th the court decided to grant an imperial edict to the Mito Middle Counselor. The gist was that the shogunate officials had concealed the shogun's wisdom and

acted arbitrarily to sign treaties on matters of great importance to the imperial nation, then reported after the fact, which was truly a reckless way of handling things. Even setting aside foreign barbarian matters for the moment, such actions caused imperial concern about how they might affect domestic order and disorder. Therefore, to exhaust the true situation of court and military and achieve eastern and western unity to devise policies for permanent security, they urged the Three Houses and Great Elder to come to Kyoto, but the Owari and Mito houses were under house confinement.

Originally it was unclear what crime this represented, but at present when foreign affairs were pressing, to thus clip the wings of the shogunate was a matter of concern regarding where people's hearts would turn. Previously they had hoped to hear the collective opinions of the Three Houses and other daimyo, and this was not solely about foreign barbarians—with domestic troubles it was even more necessary. Therefore, the Great Elder and Senior Councilors should of course gather with the Three Houses and other daimyo to concentrate group deliberation and ultimately devise policies to maintain domestic tranquility and court-military unity to organize internally and defend against foreign insults.

Since Mito was the head of the daimyo houses, Mito should transmit this matter to the collateral houses and other daimyo to convene conferences together. However, Regent Kujō was displeased with this. Therefore finally only the nobles Konoe, Takatsukasa, Ichijō, Nijō, Sanjō and others signed jointly to grant this to Mito on August 8th, but thinking it improper to keep this secret, two days later a similar edict was also sent down to the shogunate.

Therefore the Mito Middle Counselor immediately submitted a written acceptance of the imperial edict, and simultaneously consulted with the Senior Councilors about how to handle the matter. Ultimately, after deliberation, the Senior Councilors decided that regarding Mito, transmission should be limited to the Three Houses and Three Court Nobles, and regarding the court, they were in mourning for the shogun and hesitating during the mourning period, but soon Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami would travel to Kyoto and report details, which was the gist of their reply.

Prior to this, the well-known retainer and advisor to Great Elder Ii, Nagano Shuzen, had traveled to Kyoto with instructions from the Great Elder and worked extensively there in various ways. He was particularly close to Shimada Sakon, a retainer of Regent Kujō, and through this person gradually made various persuasive arguments to the Regent as well. However, at that time, as previously mentioned, the situation was extreme

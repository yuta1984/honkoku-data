Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (The Rise of Anti-Foreign Sentiment) 454

Fujita Tōko had already passed away by this time. As you know, Tōko died two years before this time, on December 2nd of Ansei 2, when there was a famous great earthquake in Edo, and he was crushed to death while trying to rescue his mother. This is widely known to all of you, I believe, but the aforementioned Kojima Kansō was also in Edo at that time and was trapped under collapsed buildings along with his father Rokusuke, but fortunately they were rescued and saved their lives.

Now, returning to our story, while Nariaki's opinion regarding Harris's demands was as described above, among the feudal lords of the main corridor, Tottori lord Matsudaira Yoshinori, being Nariaki's actual son, held roughly the same views as Nariaki. However, others had opinions that differed greatly from previous positions. Particularly Matsudaira Yoshinaga completely advocated opening the country and progressive policies, having completely changed his stance from what it was during the Kaei period that I mentioned earlier.

This was, as I mentioned before, said to be largely due to the enlightening influence of his advisor Hashimoto Sanai. Among the great hall lords, figures like Shimazu Nariakira also clearly stated that opening the country was unavoidable, so even those who still somewhat leaned toward isolationism, very few maintained the reckless and extreme positions of before.

However, the most important point to note here was that even if circumstances made it unavoidable to conclude a provisional treaty with Harris,

*Subheading: The Proposal to Seek Imperial Permission for Foreign Affairs*
this matter alone was of supreme national importance, so it must first be reported to the Imperial Court to obtain imperial permission before implementation - this was the general opinion and truly represented the most influential public sentiment of the time.

The shogunate had long held autocratic political power and had acted unilaterally on matters deemed important to the state without any hesitation. But why now, for the first time, did they seek to look up to the Imperial Court again? This seems to me a truly noteworthy and crucial point.

However, this did not begin just now. Already in Kaei 6, even Ii Naosuke had clearly stated that matters of foreign relations should properly be reported to the Imperial Court.

This is what he was saying.

Thus, regarding this foreign affairs issue, the idea that imperial permission must absolutely be sought from the Imperial Court became the prevailing public opinion of the time. However, as mentioned before, even in matters that seemed quite significant, the shogunate had previously made unilateral decisions without hesitation. Since all political authority under heaven was completely delegated from the Imperial Court to the shogunate, it was considered perfectly acceptable for the shogunate to act independently in all matters great and small, and no one found this particularly strange.

But now, when this matter of treaties with foreign countries arose, why did the arguments of feudal lords and samurai suddenly turn to the need to report this to the Imperial Court? This is truly a matter requiring scholarly research, but needless to say, our nation's national polity is eternal and unchanging, and as you know, it has a truly ancient and profound history.

That this governs the thinking of our people is completely beyond theoretical explanation, but the sincere feelings of our people expressed in the poem "Though I know not what divine presence dwells here, tears fall from overwhelming gratitude" flow continuously through all circumstances. This manifests when touched by events and circumstances, forming what we might call our nation's unique character. Particularly since the Tokugawa realm enjoyed long periods of peace, literature and learning gradually flourished during this time, and as historical research advanced, it naturally awakened national consciousness among the people.

Tokugawa Mitsukuni, as you know, was the person who undertook the compilation of the Dai Nihon-shi (Great History of Japan). As he delved deeper into the history of the imperial court, he increasingly felt the profound significance of our national polity. Even regarding the people of the Southern Court, who had been treated as rebels since the Ashikaga period, he recognized them as great loyalists, clarified the distinction between loyalty and rebellion, and built a monument to Kusunoki Masashige at Minatogawa.

*Subheading: Mitsukuni's Dai Nihon-shi and Sanyō's Nihon Gaishi*
When compared with Rai Sanyō's later work "Nihon Gaishi" (Unofficial History of Japan), one feels an indescribable fascination. Furthermore, as I briefly mentioned before, there was the rise of National Learning (kokugaku), which had various related factors.

Not only practical, but also interesting from today's perspective for understanding their historical development, so I would like to list them below.

(Town Names of Yoshida)
Enokikawagishi, Funamachi, Tamachi, Sakashitamachi
Kami-temmachi, Tennō-kōji, Honmachi, Fudakimachi, Gofukumachi
Kanejaku-temachi, Kajimachi, Shimomachi, Shimmachi, Kawaramachi
Kayamachi, Sashigasamachi, Uomachi, Mikoshi-yasumimachi, Tsujirokumachi
Kudarimachi, Shinzemmachi, Nakashiba, Tenpaku-mae, Shinmei-mae

Ryūnen-ji Seko, Saruya, Naka-seko, Dangō-miya, Midō-seko
Goshin-ji Seko, Yakushi-seko, Nishimachi, Nishi-shuku, Muro-kaidō
Kumiyashiki

Of course, regarding the historical development of these town names, there are various matters to discuss from much earlier times. Investigation has progressed gradually and some materials have been collected, but I believe there will be a time to discuss this in detail, so here I mention it briefly for reference.

Next, regarding Nobuaki's constant emphasis on frugality and simplicity toward his retainers in general, this is already well known. Nobuaki was entirely a person who followed the methods of Matsudaira Sadanobu. Fortunately, there exists a directive that Nobuaki had issued through his senior retainer to all members of the domain on the 11th day of the 2nd month of Bunka 14 (1817) in his later years. I believe this serves as an important reference for understanding the political direction of that time, so I would like to excerpt it below.

"Although the matter of frugality and simplicity has been repeatedly proclaimed and is well known to all, last winter it was again proclaimed. Even the lord's rice stipend has been reduced, and strict economy has been ordered. Considering the financial difficulties of the domain retainers is a gracious matter. Therefore, in order for all to maintain their household finances through frugality and simplicity, we wish to provide peace of mind to our lord. Regarding this, not only matters for the benefit of all, but if anyone has ideas about frugality that occur to them, they should report them. We therefore consult on the following articles:

...have been reduced, and strict economy has been ordered to such an extent. The lord's consideration for the household finances of the domain retainers is most gracious. Therefore, in order for all to maintain their finances through frugality and simplicity, we humbly wish to provide peace of mind to our lord. Regarding this, not only matters for everyone's benefit, but if anyone has personal ideas about economizing, they should report them. We therefore consult on the following articles:

1. For all domain retainers, regardless of auspicious or inauspicious occasions, meals shall be limited to one soup and three dishes
   However, simple meals may be at one's discretion

1. For promotions and other celebratory occasions, banquet dishes shall be kept simple, limited to soup and two types of simple dishes
   However, items like inkstone covers shall not be used

1. For duties outside the gate, trips to Edo, guard duty, beginnings, five seasonal festivals, congratulations, celebratory events, etc., clothing shall remain as before
   However, for New Year and five seasonal festivals, cotton sleeves may be worn if convenient

1. All domain retainers shall definitely wear cotton clothing when on duty in the castle
   However, thread-mixed single weaves may be used if convenient

1. Formal wear shall remain as previously held items

1. All domain retainers shall not use ro-chirimen (summer gauze silk) for summer haori

1. All domain retainers' family members shall not wear anything other than sleeve garments

1. The same shall apply when going outside the gate
   However, undergarments shall also follow this rule

1. Women shall not use expensive obi, woven fabrics, or other high-priced items

1. From dokurei rank and below, family members shall definitely wear cotton clothing. When going outside the gate, they shall not wear anything other than single-sleeve garments

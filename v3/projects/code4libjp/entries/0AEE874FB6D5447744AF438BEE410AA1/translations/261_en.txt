Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (National Learning Scholars in Yoshida and Hatano Takao) 496

Works like his "Yuraiki" (Record of Origins) benefited society considerably. He also wrote many tens of volumes including "Mikawa Province Historical Sites Investigation," "Personal Thoughts on Ritual Defilement," "Collection of Things Seen and Heard," "Desktop Diary," and "Miscellaneous Collection from Sakaki Garden." Among these, works like "Mikawa Province Historical Sites Investigation" were particularly thorough in their scholarly research. The original manuscript was once borrowed by the Geography Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs and was lost, but fortunately a copy remains, serving as a great reference for the world.

After the Restoration, Takao was quickly appointed as a lecturer at the Imperial Academy and went to Kyoto, but later resigned his position and returned home. In 1873 (Meiji 6) he was appointed as an assistant chief lecturer, and in 1881 (Meiji 14) as an assistant minor instructor, but as I mentioned earlier, he died of illness on June 1, 1882 (Meiji 15). A poem that could be called his death verse goes:

Until today I have lived according to the gods' will,
And after death too, according to the gods' will.

Seeing this, one should understand how much he had transcended this present world. Now regarding Hōu, this person also wrote books including thirty volumes of "Hōu's Linked Verse Collection." His diary in particular is truly magnificent, and these books have fortunately been passed down from the Hada Library to the Toyohashi City Library. In his later years he became known throughout the land for his haikai poetry, lived a life of few desires and simple tastes, and died of illness at his residence in Toyohashi's Hyakkuen on January 13, 1895 (Meiji 28) at the age of eighty-seven.

I would like to say a word here about Kozan's poetry collections. As you all know, there are truly many of these, and by reading them one can understand the thoughts of each era and also understand well his relationships with others. Since it is difficult to list them all now, I plan to discuss them gradually. However, when Kozan was still twenty-three or twenty-four years old, with his master Seigan's permission, he once opened a school at Otamagaike in Edo, but at that time he had no students at all. So he temporarily closed the house and went to visit Mito together with his senior, Fujimori Kō (Kyōsuke) An. At that time, among the poems he composed about Mount Nishiyama was:

"Flying through clouds and sky, diving deep into the abyss, for now I shall enjoy my remaining years with brush and inkstone. Reflecting on the broad learning of Master Bairi, I divine this place as heaven within a Peach Blossom Spring cave. The customs of scholars and people remain beautiful to this day, mountain flowers and wild grasses..."

"...studied in timely fashion. Clearly knowing that the inherited teachings remain stern, talented people continue to emerge generation after generation."

I introduce this here because I believe it shows Kozan's thoughts during his youth.

**《Corrections Regarding Ono Kozan》** ●Corrections: Regarding Ono Kozan

Regarding Ono Kozan's biography, as I mentioned in the previous chapter, there has been very little comprehensive research conducted to this day. This is because Kozan was truly someone who did not like to talk about his own personal history, which I believe was one cause of this situation. Therefore, since I was fortunate that Kozan was still alive at that time, I wanted to meet with him, open my heart sincerely, and listen directly to his personal history as much as he would allow. However, as I also mentioned before, I was completely unable to fulfill this intention, and my disappointment was considerable. But fortunately, among the gentlemen who had friendships with Kozan, some remain, and his son Masahiro is also still living, so I hoped to gradually meet with these people and listen to their stories. For these reasons, in this chapter I had planned to outline only the main points of the relationships between Kozan and the Bogo Incident and Hatano Takao and others, and then gradually discuss his biography as the narrative progresses through time. Of course, even to discuss the Bogo Incident and his relationships with Hatano Takao and others, I thought I should first consult with elderly people, so I have recently inquired with various individuals. However, since over fifty years have already passed since that time, while what the gentlemen say generally agrees in broad terms, when it comes to specific dates and details, their accounts vary considerably, making it difficult to piece together. In particular, regarding Kozan's personal history before he was confined in Yoshida, there is hardly anyone who knows about it. It's not that there aren't people who have heard something, but when examining it carefully, it doesn't seem very reliable...

Toyohashi Historical Discussion　　(Construction of Imahashi Castle and Makino Kohaku)　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　12
【Main text】
Research on Kohaku　Now, this is where the research on Makino Kohaku begins, but this is truly difficult because obtaining historical materials related to this region during that period is an extremely challenging undertaking, and indeed, it is often impossible to obtain them—this is the cause of the difficulty. Originally, research into historical facts requires obtaining documents from the period in question as the first necessity, but for this era there are only a few wooden temple plaques (munefuda) and nothing else. Moreover, while there are many books related to this topic, there are few that can be considered reliable source material.
　　　　　　 To give one example, there are many types of books such as "Records of Yoshida Castle's Origins," "Records of Yoshida Castle Lords," and "Records of Yoshida in Sanshū Province," but most are works by later amateur historians and are often unreliable. Also there are works describing events around that time such as "Mikawa Gofūdoki" (Later Gazetteer of Mikawa),
《Interlinear note: Historical materials related to the Imahashi period》　　　 which is claimed to be authored by Hiraiwa Shinkichi, but in reality it is completely fabricated, as proven by Ise Tenjō and others. There are countless others such as "Sōgyōki" (Records of the Founding) and "Mikawa-ki" (Records of Mikawa), and for "Mikawa-ki" there is even a book called "Mikawa-ki Variant Text Study" that researches the types of editions, showing how numerous the variants are. There is also a "Revised Mikawa Gofūdoki" edited by Narushima Jichoku and others, and for "Sōgyōki" there is a "Sōgyōki Critical Variants" researched by the Kishū house. Given this situation, while there are indeed many types of books, most are later compositions that naturally cannot be used directly as historical sources. However, there is "Mikawa Monogatari" (Tales of Mikawa) left by Ōkubo
Mikawa Monogatari　　 Hikozaemon Tadanori. This also has works of the same title but different content, and many of the "Mikawa-ki" works are said to derive from this, but the original is now in the collection of the Tokugawa ducal house and is recognized as reliable. Also there is a diary written by Ietada, ancestor of the Fukamizu Matsudaira clan,
Ietada Nikki　　and the original still exists in the Matsudaira viscount house. This Ietada was a man who died in battle along with Torii Mototada in the Battle of Fushimi in Keichō 5, but the diary was written from his youth and is treasured as the most reliable source.
　　　　　　However, this diary also has works of the same title but different content, and such variants are completely fake, requiring caution.
Matsudaira-ki　　　There is also a book called "Matsudaira-ki." The author is unknown and there are also fake versions, but the original is believed to be quite reliable.

　　　　　　However, both "Ietada Nikki" and "Matsudaira-ki" describe events from the Tenbun era onward,
　　　　　　so they are from after the Imahashi castle construction period, but since they include accounts going back much earlier to the time of Imahashi's construction,
　　　　　　I have mentioned them here for reference. There are also various works from later periods that investigated the Mikawa region, such as "Mikawa Tsutsumi," "Mikawa Meishō
Dai Mikawa-shi　　 Sōroku," "Mikawa Meisho Zue," "Mikawa Mizu," "Mikawa Fune," "Mikawa-shi," and "Dai Mikawa-shi." Among these, "Dai Mikawa-shi" was written during the Kansei era
　　　　　　and compiled by Matsudaira Raishin of the Nishio domain, and is reputed to be quite reliable. However, unfortunately I have
　　　　　　never seen it, which is regrettable. Also, "Mikawa Meisho Zue" was compiled with great enthusiasm by a metalware merchant from Yoshida Kamidenmachi named Natsume Jūzō, who invested his entire fortune,
Ushikubo Mitsudanki　 but unfortunately the sources he cited are unreliable, so it cannot serve as adequate reference material, which is regrettable. "Mikawa Tsutsumi" is similar, as for events during the Imahashi castle construction period it relies almost exclusively on the fake "Ietada Nikki," making many points unreliable. However, there is a book called "Ushikubo Mitsudanki"
　　　　　　which is also simply called "Ushikubo-ki," focusing mainly on Kohaku and describing events at Ushikubo since his time. This appears to have been written after the Genroku era
　　　　　　but is included in the "Zoku Gunsho Ruijū" and has many points worthy of reference. There is also something called "Miyashima Denki,"
　　　　　　which resembles "Ushikubo Mitsudanki." Additionally there is "Mikawa no Kuni Futabamatsu" written during the Genbun era, and its later supplement "Mikawa no Kuni Satsuhomatsu." There is also "Mikawa Suzume," and these works honestly record eyewitness accounts and traditions from the time, so they actually contain much useful material. Other works such as "Mikawa no Kuni Kobunsho" and "Mikawa
　　　　　　Zassho" are in the collection of the Aichi prefectural government and contain considerable material that can serve as historical sources. I think "Mikawa Kikigaki" and "Tahara Kingō Kikigaki" also have aspects that cannot be dismissed.
　　　　　　Given these circumstances, it is impossible to obtain reliable materials that record only events specific to this region, let alone original documents from this period. Therefore, we have no choice but to investigate broadly across general sources. So for works of general scope, something like Iida's "Yashi"

to defend against

Resenting the bakufu's lack of virtue, swallowing pain and remaining prudently hidden is ultimately

to ensure the Tokugawa lineage (not necessarily concerning the Shogun personally, but because they value the lineage, even if unavoidable circumstances require proposing abdication, ultimately ensuring that the bloodline of Tōshō-gū [Tokugawa Ieyasu] continues uninterrupted in the office of Seii Taishogun and does not lose control of national governance - this they consider essential) and the office of Seii Taishogun

maintains its position without losing control of national governance - if they consider this essential, then naturally it is crucial that even the lowest retainers not lose sight of this objective. Therefore, even if unable to endure the unbearable and transgressing into improper and unlawful conduct, somehow preventing the kind of激激 disturbance by the great outside domains that occurred this time, secretly seeking as quickly as possible

the bakufu's awareness and proper measures (in the memorials of the unruly rōnin this spring, it was written: "Among the people of Japan, from market children to foot soldiers, there is not one person who does not hate the foreign barbarians. Should any daimyo raise a banner in the name of punishing the barbarians, most would undoubtedly follow them. This is truly a time of crisis, when handling outside domains exceeds our capacity - what measures should be taken?" etc.) - such are the sincere feelings of ants and loyal devotion of dogs and horses.

It is precisely because they consider the bakufu's welfare foremost that they resent the senior councilors, exhaust their sincere intentions without regard for timely discretion or personal glory, and sacrifice their worthless lives - this is entirely

the inner sentiment of retainers who are the bakufu's own household members (Among those involved in the Kōshin disturbance was a Satsuma domain member, reportedly someone who came as an adopted son from Mito domain. Among this spring's unruly rōnin, only one or two were Mito domain retainers, the rest being rural samurai from shogunal lands, with no outside domain warriors involved. However, the names were

reportedly all changed). However, those great outside domain lords

while the bakufu's governance of the realm remained effective

looked up to the bakufu with respect, but once discipline relaxed and governance became ineffective, they would naturally drift away - this is the uniform and constant nature of such relationships. Among them, those who think deeply about the nation's welfare believe that presently

nothing can be accomplished while abandoning the bakufu, especially great matters like expelling foreigners, so they must

petition the bakufu for awareness as their primary concern, but ultimately

when the bakufu does not adopt their proposals, they naturally consider giving up, and policies of self-defense become matters of timing, particularly since, with great trepidation

His current Majesty is intelligent and has long been troubled by

Imperial concerns regarding overseas affairs (His current Majesty possesses a heroic and brilliant nature, and from his youth has already deeply considered the national situation and global changes, thoroughly studying the governance, order, and disorder of Japan and China throughout history. He has particularly worked to eliminate the evils of obstruction and stagnation, allowing even pale-faced scholars and inexperienced writings to easily reach Imperial attention. He apparently knows the names of most famous scholars and learned Confucians throughout the realm. When he heard of Mito's Fujita Seinoshin's death in an earthquake disaster in previous years, he sighed over the loss of talent, and when Chōshū's Yoshida died, he called his writings "loyal writings" - such cases make patriots throughout the realm feel deeply grateful). The nature of his sincere intentions

without much hesitation

will certainly be communicated directly to the Imperial Court. In that case, depending on Imperial instructions, he might one day be appointed to a position separate from that of Seii Taishogun, or

supporting the Imperial palanquin and advancing to Hakone, rallying the combined strength of all, he might forcefully petition

the bakufu once based on Imperial intentions (the relationship between Court and bakufu is like pulling a thousand-gold weight by a single hair). While the benefits of past peace will not be forgotten, when facing a great

crisis for the nation, they would not consider

the Tokugawa house so precious. Ultimately, it is because they think of the nation's welfare that they

exhaust their sincere efforts toward the bakufu with respectful words (the sadness of those of humble status, or writings mocking the Koume recluse, are probably typical of outside domain perspectives). Therefore, even the retainers

should understand that the long years of peaceful benefits must not be forgotten by high and low alike, but when facing such unpredictable times as the present, considering the nation

foremost, and naturally

not interfering with the bakufu, of course

they may discuss and evaluate the merits and demerits, advantages and disadvantages of bakufu policies as before, but retainers like those mentioned above are hardly suitable for trusted employment or contrition - they abandon body and house in inappropriate circumstances,

abandon the Shogun, resent the senior councilors, suffer meaningless punishment, and aspire to worthless deeds - one could mock and pity such people. Naturally

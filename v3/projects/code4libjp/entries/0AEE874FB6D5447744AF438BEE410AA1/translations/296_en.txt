　　　　　　　　　●Change of Osaka Castle Deputy and Subsequent Situation

**First Chōshū Expedition**

　　　　　　Now, as stated in the previous chapter, on July 19th of Bunkyū 4, which became Genji when the era name was changed, warriors of Chōshū domain attempted a counterattack in Kyoto and unexpectedly clashed with forces of Aizu, Kuwana and other domains. At that time Satsuma domain also assisted the Aizu and Kuwana forces to protect the imperial palace, and ultimately Chōshū domain was defeated. In any case, at this time Chōshū domain fired upon the Imperial Palace and deeply troubled His Majesty, so they finally received the stigma of being enemies of the court, and on the 22nd of this month an imperial edict for the Chōshū expedition was issued. This was the so-called First Chōshū Expedition. Of course, as you know, this incident involved extremely complex circumstances, but Owari Chūnagon Yoshikatsu was appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the Chōshū expedition, and Saigō Takamori also worked extremely hard on its resolution - I believe this too is already known to you all. In the end, Chōshū domain's senior retainers Masuda Uemon-suke, Fukuhara Echigo, Kokuji Shinano and others were ordered to commit seppuku, and domain lord Yoshichika and his son went into confinement to await punishment. The five court nobles including Sanjō Sanetomi, who were in exile in Chōshū domain at the time, were handed over to Chikuzen domain, and on December 27th the matter reached a temporary conclusion.

**Nobukatsu's Change from Osaka Castle Deputy**

　　　　　　However, with such developments the entire country was in an increasingly turbulent state. On November 1st of that year, Matsudaira Nobukatsu was suddenly ordered to proceed to Edo, and upon Makino Etchū-no-kami's arrival in Osaka, was commanded to transfer the castle deputy position. So Nobukatsu departed Osaka on January 21st of the following second year of Genji, stayed one night at Yoshida Castle on the 29th, arrived in Edo on February 8th, and attended the castle on the 15th. He was immediately relieved of the Osaka Castle Deputy position and further appointed to Tamari-no-ma duty. Of course, the position of Osaka Castle Deputy was an extremely difficult one, held by hereditary daimyo, but the primary difficulty was being unable to bear the expenses. Especially given the national situation as I have gradually described, the hardships endured by Yoshida domain during this posting were truly extraordinary. However, now the transfer was arranged, and simultaneously Nobukatsu was appointed to Tamari-no-ma duty, henceforth to participate in shogunal government

　　　　　　This was an extremely unprecedented matter, as traditionally Tamari-no-ma appointment was only given to great lords, and for a 70,000-koku hereditary domain to receive this was truly exceptional. I would like to briefly mention here Nobukatsu's name change.

**Nobukatsu's Change of Title to Gyōbu-taiyu**

　　　　　　As I have mentioned repeatedly, Nobukatsu had until then succeeded his ancestors and held the title Izu-no-kami, but on December 11th of Genji 1 he submitted a request, and on the 22nd of the same month changed his title to Gyōbu-taiyu. The reason for this change is quite unclear, but it was probably because around that time Matsumae Izu-no-kami was appointed as senior councilor, creating a duplication of titles.

**Nobukatsu Appointed to Tamari-no-ma Duty**

　　　　　　The official notification regarding his appointment to Tamari-no-ma duty reads as follows:

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Matsudaira Gyōbu-taiyu
　　　　　　　During his service tenure, on both occasions of
　　　　　　　His Majesty's visits to Osaka, he served with dedication, and by special consideration is
　　　　　　　appointed to Tamari rank. Regarding courtesy seats, henceforth monthly he shall sit next to the Gokuro-shoin Tamari, separately with Sakakibara Shikibu-taiyu, yourself, Sakai Kawachi-no-kami, and Sakai Saemon-no-jō together for
　　　　　　　audience. For the five seasonal festivals he shall take his seat next to the Goshiro-shoin Tamari
　　　　　　　for audience. The Osaka Castle Deputy position is hereby relieved.

　　　　　　With such arrangements, the Osaka Castle Deputy position that Yoshida domain had long struggled with was finally transferred, and the domain retainers either returned to their home province or followed the domain lord to Edo. This year the era name was changed to Keiō.

**Foreign Warships Enter Settsu Bay**

　　　　　　Furthermore, domestic affairs centered on diplomatic issues became increasingly turbulent. In September of that year, foreign ministers insisted that previous agreements must be fulfilled and ports at the two capitals of Edo and Osaka, as well as Hyōgo and Niigata, must be opened. Since most of the senior councilors happened to be traveling west at the time, with the determination that if no resolution could be reached with the councilors they would proceed to pressure the court directly, they suddenly [departed from Yokohama]

They encountered circumstances requiring fundamental reforms. Therefore, the purpose was not necessarily to arrest patriots and sweep them all up in one net to apply severe punishments, but as mentioned before, the trend gradually became more dangerous as events progressed, ultimately leading to the greatest purge since the founding of the Tokugawa house. In any case, given these circumstances, they initially detained Umeda and the Ukai father and son, hoping to promote reflection among court officials.

**Patriots Successively Arrested**

However, seeing that these measures had no prospect of success, on the 22nd they arrested Kobayashi Minbu-gon-taiyu, the house administrator of the Takatsukasa family, and within about a month thereafter witnessed the arrests of Kusakabe Isaji, Hashimoto Sanai, Fujimori Kyōsuke, and others. At this time, there were differences of opinion between Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami and Kyoto Deputy Sakai Wakasa-no-kami, and some differences also existed with Great Elder Ii in Edo. Essentially, Shimōsa-no-kami's views were roughly similar to Great Elder Ii's, with his attitude gradually inclining toward hardline policies, while Wakasa-no-kami consistently sought to resolve matters through moderate measures. However, this discord among shogunate officials became apparent to the court nobles, seemingly contributing to further escalation of the situation.

Nevertheless, the strategies of Great Elder Ii and Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami achieved some immediate success. Despite various complications during this period,

**Regent Kujō's Restoration**

they ultimately witnessed the restoration of Regent Kujō to his position. Great Elder Ii then vigorously urged Shimōsa-no-kami to advance the matter of imperial permission for the treaties, but this again became a difficult situation that could not be easily resolved. Meanwhile, interrogations of the previously arrested patriots gradually progressed, and their conspiracies were increasingly exposed, resulting in arrests occurring in various places. Since confrontations between those arrested in Kyoto and those arrested in Edo became necessary,

**Accomplices Sent East**

these individuals were ultimately transported to Edo, arriving on December 19th and placed in the custody of Sakakibara Shikibu-taiyu and Matsu-

daira Hida-no-kami. Among them was the well-known Rai Mikisaburō, and Yoshida Shōin was also sent to Edo under arrest. Amid this great turmoil, various disputes arose in the court, but through Regent Kujō's significant mediation,

**Imperial Decree Postponing Expulsion of Foreigners**

ultimately on December 24th, Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami's memorial was generally approved. However, what must be greatly noted here is that the fundamental policies regarding foreign relations already differed between the court and the shogunate. Therefore, the essence of Shimōsa-no-kami's memorial, seeking to handle matters as smoothly as possible through expediency, deliberately avoided fundamental issues of interest and described the current exhaustion of the nation's upper and lower classes and neglect of military preparations, explaining that abruptly rejecting foreign demands would truly be a great difficulty risking national survival. He elaborated that fortunately, once national defense was complete in the future, it would not be difficult to distance foreigners at any time following imperial wishes, and since they sought commercial profits, if profits were simply not provided to them, they would naturally withdraw on their own. The imperial decree recognized these unavoidable circumstances, essentially postponing the expulsion of foreigners and achieving temporary settlement. However, for Shimōsa-no-kami and the shogunate officials of the time, even this expedient solution carried more weight than the nine sacred tripods.

There is much more to discuss regarding these developments, but here I intend to present the main points and proceed, so I ask for your understanding in this matter. In any case, for the reasons stated above,

**Shimōsa-no-kami's Return to the Capital**

Shimōsa-no-kami had achieved his purpose in going to Kyoto and thus prepared to return to Edo. His departure was on February 20th of the following year (Ansei 6), and he returned to Edo on March 15th. However, in Edo, examinations of the prisoners previously sent east were being conducted, with Senior Councilor Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami as the supervisor, and

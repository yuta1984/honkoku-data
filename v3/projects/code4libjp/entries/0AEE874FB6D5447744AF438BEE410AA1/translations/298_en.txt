**Ceasefire of the Second Chōshū Expedition**

fell gravely ill and soon passed away. Prior to this, the shogunate had concluded that a ceasefire was inevitable and had appointed Katsu Awa-no-kami as negotiation commissioner. At this point, Yoshinobu summoned Katsu to Kyoto, gave him various private instructions, and finally decided to have him negotiate a ceasefire with Chōshū domain. Therefore, Katsu met with Chōshū representatives Hirosawa Hyōsuke, Ōta Ichinoshin, Inoue Bunta, and Nagamatsu Bunsuke at Taigan-ji temple in Hiroshima, Geishū. Ultimately, Katsu stated: "Now that the shogun has already passed away, in this time of domestic turmoil, the foreign powers are watching our country, waiting to take advantage of any opening. If we fail to comprehend the great trends of the world and merely engage in domestic strife, we may follow in India's footsteps and leave regrets for a thousand generations with no remedy. In today's circumstances, we should renew the great government, reform our discipline, and establish the foundation of our nation's independence. This is an urgent matter that cannot be delayed even one day. Yoshinobu's true intention lies precisely here. Therefore, the shogunate is about to issue ceasefire orders and withdraw forces from all fronts. Even if Chōshū domain is unwilling to comply with this order, we hope you will not pursue our retreating forces." Hirosawa's response was: "Chōshū domain has no intention whatsoever of invading others. Much less do we wish to take advantage of the shogunate's great misfortune to engage in warfare. If the shogunate intends to withdraw its forces and renew the great government, we only hope that its actual achievements will be clearly evident." With this, the ceasefire negotiations concluded. What was truly delightful was that at this crucial moment, both heroes Katsu and Hirosawa, motivated purely by patriotic sincerity without any personal agenda, engaged in these negotiations and laid the foundation for opening a new chapter in our history. At this time, Inoue alone visited Katsu's lodgings to discuss his impressions from his personal study abroad in England, arguing that our country must also follow world trends and enhance national prestige. He extensively discussed his theories of opening the country and imperial loyalty, and Katsu is said to have expressed agreement with these views.

**Relationship Between the Rise and Fall of Shogunate and Chōshū, and Foreign Diplomacy**

I would like to briefly mention here the diplomatic relationships of that time. As you know, France at that time was extremely friendly with the shogunate and sought to assist it in conquering Satsuma and Chōshū, while conversely, Britain tended to befriend Satsuma and Chōshū and encourage them to resist the shogunate. Originally, both Satsuma and Chōshū

domains had both once exchanged cannon fire with Britain, but since those peace negotiations, they conversely came to respect each other and solidified their friendship. Particularly in Chōshū, since Itō and Inoue had initially studied in Britain and returned with knowledge of that country's conditions, communication between them became even smoother. Indeed, the rise and fall of shogunate and Chōshū power at that time was greatly related to foreign diplomacy, and I believe this is an extremely important matter requiring research in Restoration history.

**Alliance of Satsuma and Chōshū Domains Achieved**

Now, as you have probably understood from what I have gradually explained since the previous chapter, ever since the Terada-ya Incident that occurred in Fushimi in Bunkyū 1, unfavorable feelings had gradually accumulated between Satsuma and Chōshū. From then on, they increasingly became estranged from each other, ultimately reaching the point of bitter mutual hostility. Chōshū people constantly told Satsuma people to consider the Shimonoseki Strait as the River of Three Crossings (the river of death), declaring they would never allow safe passage through this strait. However, subsequently in Satsuma domain, Saigō Takamori reemerged and assumed a position to influence domain policy. He secluded himself in Okazaki, Kyoto, constantly maintaining communication with the reclusive Lord Iwakura, while domain administration came under the control of Ōkubo Ichizō, who could adopt almost the same principles as Saigō. However, since Saigō was truly a person of outstanding wisdom and extraordinary ability, he carefully observed Chōshū's movements. Seeing that its radical party was recklessly impetuous, frequently making mistakes and falling into desperate situations, he did not easily ally with them. Also seeing that the shogunate was procrastinating and temporizing without any long-term strategies, merely patching things up temporarily, he naturally could not support it either. He maintained a cautious attitude, observing the trends of the times, as I believe I outlined in the previous chapter. Now with the Chōshū expedition, Saigō had much to decide. If they continued to let the shogunate have its way and severely oppress Chōshū, it would allow the shogunate to restore its former authority. This would contradict the spirit of imperial loyalty. Today's circumstances require dealing with new trends of the times, opening new prospects, and carrying out great reforms. To accomplish this, they must now ally with Chōshū to restrain the shogunate...

like a prisoner. The master composed poetry to express his feelings, showing absolutely no color of resentment or indignation, while his patriotic aspirations became ever more urgent. When officials and soldiers occasionally spoke to him about various incidents in the east and west, he would remain silent and not respond, looking up at the ceiling and sighing deeply. However, the master was naturally gentle and kind, and his discussions were different from those of the world's radical and violent elements. Therefore, when he heard of their plots to assassinate foreigners or gather parties to raise armies, he would again lament and say: "Crude schemes and shallow thinking only bring calamity upon oneself. What benefit is there to the country?" His aspirations were focused solely on rectifying stagnant governance, correcting shogunate politics, proclaiming imperial majesty, and repelling foreign enemies - he remained firm and unwavering from beginning to end. The officials and soldiers initially feared he might escape and kept extremely strict guard over him. Later, seeing that he showed no signs of resentment or indignation, they all came to respect and serve him quite intimately. Some secretly sent fine wine and good medicine, or requested poems and calligraphy. Although the master had incurred guilt from his domain, the fact that he escaped the deep injustice and bitter suffering during the shogunate's cruel laws was probably because he had always possessed genuine insight and integrity throughout his life, without a single point of self-serving personal interest. The master descended from Councilor Lord Ono. Since ancient times, his family had taken the surname Yokoyama from their ancestral domain's place name. Recently he restored his original surname Ono, so scholars throughout the land mostly called him Master Yokoyama, not knowing his surname was Ono. His given name was Maki, his courtesy name Kaishi, and also Shukō. In his later years he again changed his name to Chōgan with the courtesy name Dōō. The literary names Kozan and Kyōkyō were used throughout his life.

From what we see above, because Kozan was modest and would not easily speak of his personal history, Shigeaki created this biography based on a brief biography written by Kozan's disciple from what he knew. Moreover, this biography is quite trustworthy and its main points agree with the preface by Keiu that I mentioned earlier. That is, Kozan had already gone to Edo when he was quite young, and there is no doubt that he was closest to Yanagawa Seigan. Seigan's revival of Otamagaike in Kanda and establishment of a poetry society there was around the fifth year of Tenpō (1834), which is clearly recorded in detail in the Seigan Collection. Poets from throughout the land gathered there in great numbers, and it is a fact that Kozan also joined this poetry society. Since Seigan remained there until the second year of Kōka (1845), the journey to Mito by Kozan and Kōan that I mentioned earlier was around the eighth year of Tenpō (1837), still during Seigan's residence at Otamagaike. However, according to one theory, at this time Kozan had already established his own school at the same Otamagaike, but in those days he still had few disciples and was troubled by this - though I think this theory still requires research. Previously I simply followed that theory in my account, but here I want to also mention the doubtful points.

I would like to mention these points.

Now, in the second year of Kōka (1845), Seigan moved to Kyoto, but Kozan continued to live in Edo as before. Looking at the preface to Kozan's "Poetry Screen Volumes 3 and 4," it says: "Poetry Screen Volumes 1 and 2 were completed during the days of my new residence at Tamagaike during the Kōka-Kaei period, which is now 37-38 years ago." Since this preface was written in the 17th year of Meiji (1884), calculating from this, the "new residence at Tamagaike" was probably around the 3rd-4th years of Kōka (1846-1847), when Kozan was 33-34 years old. Thinking about it this way, perhaps this was when Kozan established his household at Otamagaike. I also mention this here, hoping to receive instruction from all of you.

Now, at that time, as I have gradually mentioned before, problems related to the arrival of foreign ships were becoming increasingly troublesome, and Kozan was truly unable to bear his feelings of patriotic indignation and sorrowful anger - it appears he could not sleep even when lying down. Therefore, he frequently presented memorials to his daimyo, and also made proposals to the senior councilor of the time, Abe Masahiro, as well as to Ii Naosuke. His arguments were quite alarming and capable of stirring people to action, but when a friend reproached him for speaking rashly without choosing his audience, Kozan replied asking how one could afford to be selective about people in times of urgent crisis. Also, because of his close friendship with Fujita Tōko, through him he also presented memorials to Mito's Nariaki, and through Seigan's mediation, he even presented proposals to the Imperial Court. At this time too, some among his friends blamed him for the crime of exceeding his station, but Kozan said that when the country faced foreign enemies, how could there be leisure to worry about punishment and censure? These matters are described in detail in the "Biography of Master Kyōkyō" that I published earlier. However, since all the original drafts of those memorials from that time were burned and discarded, the details are unknown, but fortunately, looking at the two or three poems included in the "Biography of Master Kyōkyō," one can truly understand their main purport quite well. Particularly the poem sent to the Head of the University Hayashi truly expresses his thought completely, and there were many other poems satirizing the world...

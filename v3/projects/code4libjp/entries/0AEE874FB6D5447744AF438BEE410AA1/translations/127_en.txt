Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (The Ogasawara Family Generations and Yoshida's Circumstances) 228

**Main Text:**
"This year the lord of Yoshida Castle divided [his domain] among two younger brothers: Ogasawara Tango-no-kami Nagasada received 3,000 koku, with administrative offices at Nagayama village; chief retainer Yoshida Hachibe lived within Yoshida Castle, deputy Gotō Kintayū lived in Nagayama; Ogasawara Geki received 2,000 koku, with administrative offices established at Nishikawa village."

From this, it appears that at this time Nagasada established administrative offices for his newly granted territory in Nagayama village in Hōi district, while Geki did so in Nishikawa village in Yana district.

Naganori was born in Kan'ei 1 (1624), with the childhood name Senkatsumaru. He later took the name Tadamoto, then changed it to Nagayori, and finally to Naganori. He was initially called Minbu, and on December 29, Shōhō 1 (1644), he was granted junior fifth rank lower and appointed Yamashiro-no-kami. When this man was still 27 years old, on the occasion of his deceased mother's 17th memorial anniversary, he personally copied and dedicated a Lotus Sutra for her spiritual merit. This sutra still remains at Rinzai-ji temple, and its postscript reads:

"Keian 3, year of the Metal Tiger, 8th day of the 10th month, on the occasion of the 17th memorial of my beloved mother, Hōgen-in Nisshin Daishi's noble spirit, to repay even one ten-thousandth of her maternal kindness, I personally and gradually copied this eight-scroll Lotus Sutra in gold letters, respectfully dedicating it before her, humbly praying for her immediate attainment of Buddhahood and for all sentient beings to escape the sea of suffering and directly reach the place of enlightenment. Ogasawara Yamashiro-no-kami Minamoto Tadamoto, burning incense, respectfully wrote this."

Moreover, examining the sutra text, every scroll is extremely detailed and completely written with care. Furthermore, when his father Tadatomo died in the 7th month of Kanbun 3 (1663), Naganori also relocated and rebuilt the current Rinzai-ji temple to pray for his soul, and for this purpose he issued proclamations granting special privileges to the village farmers, as I already mentioned in the previous chapter on the development of Kawara-machi. From these examples, I believe we can conclude that Naganori was a person of very gentle heart and deep filial piety.

Additionally, this person showed deep reverence for gods and Buddha. At that time, the Shinmei Shrine of present-day Naka-hachi district was still located within the castle grounds, and it was also Naganori who first donated a stone torii gate to it. This occurred on September 28, Kanbun 13 (1673), but the current torii was repaired after the original fell due to an earthquake. The donation plaque from that time is still preserved at the shrine.

Now, Naganori became a sōshaban (master of ceremonies) shortly after his succession, and from July 19, Kanbun 6 (1666), he also served concurrently as jisha-bugyō (magistrate of temples and shrines). Kanbun changed to Enpō in its 13th year, and he died of illness on February 8, Enpō 6 (1678), at the age of 55. He was buried at Rinzai-ji temple with the posthumous name Taiun-in Hōhō Shōin Koji. Afterward, his eldest son Nagasuke succeeded him.

Originally, as I mentioned before, this Ogasawara family began when Tadatomo first separated from the main family, so Tadatomo was, so to speak, its founder. From his time, four generations served consecutively as lords of this area, totaling approximately 53 years. Except for the later Ōkōchi family, this house ruled this area the longest. However, as you know, the Tokugawa realm was extremely peaceful at that time, so there were no upheavals to speak of, and there is very little to discuss. Nevertheless, some matters remain regarding civil administration, which I plan to describe gradually.

Now, this Nagasuke was born in Shōhō 1 (1644), with the childhood name Chiyomatsu, later taking names like Nagaharu and Naganori. On December 28, Kanbun 3 (1663), he was appointed to junior fifth rank lower as Noto-no-kami. On the last day of the 3rd month of Enpō 6 (1678), he inherited his father's domain, and on September 1st of the 7th year, he changed his title to Iki-no-kami. However, the following year, Shogun Ietsuna died, and the well-known 5th shogun Tsunayoshi entered from Tatebayashi to succeed the main family. From this year the era name changed to Tenna, Tenna became Jōkyō in its 4th year, and Jōkyō became Genroku in its 5th year.

Indeed, this was the height of peace throughout the realm during the Tokugawa period. Customs became quite luxurious, and the Genroku era represents the peak of Edo prosperity that everyone knows. This extravagant trend spread even to the provinces, and the famous Yoshida fireworks also became grand from this time.

Of course, these fireworks were performed during the festival of Yoshida Shrine. According to records preserved by the Ishida family, who were formerly shrine priests there, the first large building was completed in Genroku 13 (1700), measuring 13 ken long and 3.5 ken wide, costing 24 ryō. The festival float curtains for Honmachi district were also completed in Genroku 16 (1703), and the costumes for the bamboo grass dance from Kayamachi were originally cotton yukata...

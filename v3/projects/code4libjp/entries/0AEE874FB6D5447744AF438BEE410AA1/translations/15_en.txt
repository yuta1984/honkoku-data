　　　　　　I cannot but admire this deeply, and I always pay my respects to the elder's virtuous legacy. Therefore I earnestly desire to perpetuate his virtuous
　　　　　　legacy forever. Now, turning back to the era I mentioned earlier - from over a thousand years ago to over nine hundred years
　　　　　　ago - what was the situation of our country during this period? The year Jōwa 2 mentioned in the Grand Council of State decree in the 'Ruijū Sandai-kyaku'
　　　　　　was exactly during the reign of Emperor Ninmyō, seven years before Jōwa 9 when the rebellion of Tachibana no Hayanari occurred. The Enchō era when the 'Wamyō
　　　　　　Ruijūshō' is said to have been completed was during the reign of Emperor Daigo, and between Jōwa and Enchō roughly a hundred years passed, spanning the reigns of Buntoku, Seiwa,
《Interlinear note: Mikawa Provincial Capital and Provincial Governors}}　　　Yōzei, Kōkō, and Uda, when the culture of the Heian court was reaching the height of its prosperity. At that time, the Mikawa provincial capital
　　　　　　was located in Hōi District, and while there are different theories about its exact location today, it is generally believed to have been situated from present-day Kōfu-chō northward
　　　　　　in the vicinity of Yahata village. The people who served as provincial governors at that time included:
　　　　 　　Tachibana no Mototsugu, Prince Buzen, Sugawara no Tsugukado, Abe no Ujinushi, Abe no Yoshiyuki, Fujiwara no Yasumune, Nagaoka no Hideo, Fujiwara no Yoshitomo, and Minamoto no Susumu,
　　　　　　as recorded in the 'Shoku Nihon Kōki,' 'Buntoku Jitsuroku,' 'Sandai Jitsuroku,' and other works. The term of office for provincial governors at this time was four years, though some
　　　　 　　were reappointed and served continuously for eight to ten years.
《Interlinear note: Change in Tōkaidō Route}}　　　So, as I mentioned before, the present site of Toyohashi was a crucial route on the Tōkaidō during this period, but the river width was so broad that
　　　　　　travel was inconvenient. Therefore, the route was eventually changed, with travelers crossing the river at an upstream point to reach Toyokawa-juku, which is present-day
　　　　　　Furujuku. In the Ichijō Minister's sliding door paintings from Eikan 1, nine hundred twenty-four years ago, there appears:
《Interlinear note: Shigasuga Crossing}}　　　"Though there are boat routes that come and go, the Shigasuga crossing has left no trace"
　　　　　　This Shigasuga crossing refers to the area between Watazu and Akumi mentioned earlier, and references to it in Sei Shōnagon's 'Pillow Book' and other ancient
　　　　　　collections all seem to refer to this same place. However, the 'Sarashina Diary' describes this Shigasuga crossing as if it were on the border between Owari
　　　　　　and Mikawa, but since this diary contains many errors and omissions, it cannot be considered very reliable evidence.

San'yō Shimpō No. 3,682 Supplement　　　(Published February 14, Meiji 44)
【Main text】
　　　　　　This diary was written by the daughter of Fujiwara no Kōhyō who became the wife of Tachibana no Toshimichi, and dates from about eight hundred forty years ago. It includes
　　　　　　an account of her return journey from the east to Kyoto, and the aforementioned passage appears in that section. Also in the same passage, after mentioning Takashi Beach,
　　　　　　it refers to Yatsuhashi, then mentions Futamura-yama, and later Miyaji-yama - the order is clearly confused.
　　　　　　However, I find it quite interesting that it describes staying at a roadside house in the mountains of Futamura-yama where there was a large persimmon tree whose fruit
　　　　　　fell with plopping sounds throughout the night. In the Tokugawa period, pines and cedars were planted along both sides of roads, and zelkova trees at mile markers,
　　　　　　but in the Nara period, fruit-bearing trees were commonly planted so that travelers could freely pick and eat the fruit when they felt
　　　　　　tired. This passage seems to provide evidence of this practice, which I find quite fascinating. Now, there are various sources that provide evidence for this change in the highway route, and here we have
　　　　　　the 'Kaidōki' written by Minamoto no Mitsuyuki in Jōō 2. This work from six hundred eighty-seven years ago has traditionally been attributed to Kamo no
　　　　　　Chōmei and called the 'Chōmei Kaidōki,' but various scholars have established that it was actually written by Mitsuyuki. This record describes passing through Honno
Toyokawa-juku　　　ガahara and staying at Toyokawa-juku, then venturing out late at night to see the broad river flow - truly an abundant crossing. The sound of waves falling on the rocky rapids of the river
　　　　　　resonates in the moonlight, the sound of wind passing along the riverbank whitens the night, and in the dwellings of the shore birds there is nothing more familiar than the moon to sing about.
　　　　　　In other words, Mitsuyuki at this time took the new highway route to reach Toyokawa-juku, but naturally the river flow at that
　　　　　　time was different from today's condition, as the present river course changed due to the great earthquake of Meiō 8.
Minamoto no Yoritomo's Journey to Kyoto　Also, before this, when Minamoto no Yoritomo unified the realm and traveled from Kamakura to Kyoto in the tenth month of Kenkyū 1, seven hundred twelve years ago,
　　　　　　his younger brother Noriyori was governor of Mikawa Province with Adachi Morinaga as administrator. Yoritomo at that time also entered the Kumo valley of Mikawa from Hashimoto-juku in Enshū Province,
　　　　　　passed Fumon-ji temple and emerged at Iwasaki, where he is said to have dedicated a saddle to a shrine - the Kurakake Shrine still exists today. This place called Hashimoto was submerged and became ocean due to the great earthquake of Meiō 8, leaving only traces

Now, there is one more person I would like to discuss - Kawanishi Shiryū. Shiryū's given name was Sen, his courtesy name was Kakusuke, later changed to Sansuke. Shiryū was his pen name, but later he also used the name Kanshū. He was the second son of Yoshida retainer Nakai Gyōuemon Hōhō, but at age twelve he left and was adopted by Koromo domain retainer Kawanishi. He possessed exceptional natural talent and spirited character. He first studied under a man named Takemura Kaisai, but in his twenties entered Shōheikō school to study classical studies and literature, eventually becoming not only highly valued by his domain but also widely known throughout the realm. He died in Tenpō 13, second month, at age 42, which was truly regrettable. His writings have been collected into a book called "Kanshū Ikō" (Kanshū's Posthumous Manuscripts). Since this person's story belongs to the Nobuyori era, it would have been appropriate to discuss him then, but since I omitted him at that time, I am fortunate to be able to tell his story here now. The fact that this famous person was from our Yoshida domain came to my attention through Tabei Ryūtarō of the Aichi Prefecture History compilation project, and I would like to express my deep gratitude to him on this occasion.

Next is the story of the painter Yamada Dōsetsu. Previously I mistakenly mentioned this person's name as Yokoyama Bundō, which was completely erroneous. However, this Yamada Dōsetsu also served Nobuyori around the same time as Bundō. Dōsetsu was a disciple of Kanō Dōrin and was quite skilled in calligraphy. His brushwork still remains today and includes truly excellent pieces. This person died in Tenpō 13, sixth month, at age 61. His son Shinsei, whose given name was Okisane, was also a disciple of Kanō Shinshō and was a considerable painter. He also used the pen name Kasetsu and once worked on paintings during the restoration of Nikkō Shrine alongside his master. He died in Ansei 4, seventh month, at age 41, and was the father of the painter Nagatoy, who as you know died in Toyohashi in Meiji 17, eleventh month, at age 36.

Now, among the townspeople at that time there were also three or four painters, some with considerable skill. Onda Sekihō was the son of Onda Sanshō whom I mentioned earlier. His given name was Hō, his courtesy name was Taiku, and his common name was Kichisaku. He studied painting under Watanabe Nangaku of Kyoto and achieved considerable mastery. When Watanabe Kazan was confined to Tahara, a wealthy family in Tahara had a new gold screen made and wanted to commission Sekihō to paint on it. When Kazan heard of this, he requested that he be allowed to paint it instead. The family was troubled by this request, so they secretly loaded the screen onto a boat and sent it to Yoshida, politely declined Kazan's offer, and had Sekihō paint it instead. This story remains, and I believe it is not fabricated but completely factual. While it serves as an interesting anecdote about how Kazan's painting was not yet widely recognized at the time, it also indicates how renowned Sekihō was in those days. Also at that time, in Shimoji in Hoi District, there was a man named Yamamoto Teishin who thoroughly investigated local historical sites and ancient remains, and authored "Yoshida Meishōsōroku" (Record of Famous Sites in Yoshida). He apparently also intended to write something called "Mikawa Meishōsōroku" (Record of Famous Sites in Mikawa), but this seems never to have been completed. The illustrations in "Yoshida Meishōsōroku" were mostly painted by Sekihō, depicting the customs of the time as well as shrines, temples, and landscapes, all done from life, making them extremely valuable references for us today. Sekihō also studied flower arrangement under his father Sanshō, and later inherited his father's name and was called Shin'ōken. He died in Kōka 4, fifth month.

Also at that time, there was a painter named Baiu, son of Satō Nankan whom I mentioned briefly earlier. He was a disciple of Shukushinsai and was called Taikan. He died on May 14, Kaei 1, at age 75.

Then there was Fukutani Suichiku. This person's common name was Tōzaemon, and he was quite wealthy. He studied haikai poetry under Seiseishō Takuchi and also studied tea ceremony under Fuzōan of Okazaki, achieving mastery in both. He also had considerable skill in painting that could be called masterful. Works like the Buddha's Nirvana image that was kept at Satō Yakichi's place in Gofuku-chō were most interesting. This person was in Ka-

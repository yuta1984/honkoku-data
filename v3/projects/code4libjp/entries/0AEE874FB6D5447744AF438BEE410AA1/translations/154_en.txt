focused efforts on relief measures, but even during Yoshimune's time, the main concern of shogunal administration remained this problem of financial relief. Consequently, expense reduction became the primary concern, and its effects reached even to such matters as these. When comparing and contrasting the underlying causes with the actual results, I find it quite fascinating.

Since the officials for bridge construction were dispatched from the shogunate, Yoshida domain paid particular attention to their treatment, which is also recorded in the official diary entry for February 23rd, Shōtoku 3, as follows:

1. Regarding the departure of the bridge construction magistrates from this area in the near future, messengers were sent yesterday to both officials for farewell visits. The arrangements for hospitality in Yoshida, as previously communicated, are as follows:

Lord Kihara Inaba-no-kami
Lord Nishiyama Jūemon

1. When arriving in Yoshida, the town magistrate shall come to town
1. At the time of arrival, prepare suitable dishes and have them sent to the inn
1. One senior retainer each shall pay respects at arrival, twice during the stay, and once before returning to Edo
1. Gifts shall be presented once upon arrival, and thereafter once monthly with suitable items
1. Yasumatsu Kinemon and Horie Giemon shall occasionally pay respects and naturally communicate any official business
1. Kinemon and Giemon shall also maintain appropriate correspondence with the retainers of both officials
1. Upon completion of construction, sake and delicacies shall be presented to both officials

Town Master Carpenter

1. Items sent to inns and gifts should be appropriate in accordance with the magistrates' status
1. Yasumatsu Kinemon and Horie Giemon shall pay respects
1. Visits by senior retainers shall be arranged according to circumstances

The above

When considered from today's perspective, this seems quite amusing, but even today, when visiting remote countryside areas, similar practices are not uncommon. Those in positions of political authority must understand the common people's circumstances and strive to eliminate such abuses.

**River Control Notice Board**
The discussion of bridge construction has become quite lengthy, but I would like to mention one more thing: in Kyōhō 6, Yoshida domain erected a notice board regarding river control and bridge matters. This notice board was erected beside the Great Bridge. Fortunately, the actual board is now preserved in a Funamachi warehouse, and as it serves as valuable civil administration historical material, I will reproduce its full text below.

Memorandum - Cypress board (5 shaku 8 sun long, 4 bu thick, 1 shaku 5 bu wide)

1. When the river is in flood, as previously ordered, the Funamachi village headman, group leaders, boatmen, and laborers from Hatanaka shall gather at the Great Bridge and understand that they must remove bamboo and timber caught on the bridge pillars.

1. When river water suddenly rises and bamboo, timber or other items flow down from upstream, laborers shall retrieve them immediately. If the original owner comes seeking them, the village headman and group leaders shall witness the return according to ancient custom through direct negotiation. If the owner cannot be identified, the matter shall be reported to the authorities for instruction.

1. From below the Great Bridge to upstream of Yokosuka River, every year by June, the village headman and group leaders shall inspect and ensure there are no obstructions to boat traffic.

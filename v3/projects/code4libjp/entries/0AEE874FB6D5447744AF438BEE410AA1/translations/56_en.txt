died in battle, so at that time his father Yoshimitsu was still alive, but ultimately Shigesada's position was succeeded by his younger brother Tadashige. This person was initially called Jinpei, later Danjō, but died at Nirengi on the twenty-fifth day of the fifth month of Eiroku 10, so his son Torachiyo succeeded him.

**Toda Yasunaga** This Torachiyo later took the name Yasunaga and was called Tamba-no-kami, and was specially granted the Matsudaira surname by Ieyasu. However, at the time of succession he was only six years old, so Toda Den'jūrō Yoshikuni served as deputy commander (jindai) and assisted Yasunaga. Most sources record that Yasunaga was Tadashige's son, but there is a theory that he was actually Shigesada's son and had not yet been born at the time of Shigesada's death in battle. This is the theory of the "Toda Family Genealogy Correction Supplement" (Toda Kakei Kōsei Yoroku), which is quite a novel theory that I would like to mention.

What I would like to discuss here is the ancestors of the current Count Toda family, who were lords of Ōgaki before the Meiji Restoration. This family considers Kazuaki as their restoration ancestor, and the "Kansei Chōshū Shokafu" begins the genealogy from Kazuaki's grandfather Ujiteru.

**Toda Ujiteru** This Ujiteru was called Shinjirō or Magoemon, served Matsudaira Kiyoyasu from Kyōroku 2, and later also served Hirotada. He died in the seventh month of Kōji 3 at age sixty-five, and is said to have been the fourth-generation descendant of Toda Munemitsu. Since ancient records were completely lost in a fire at Yoshida long ago, the "Kansei Chōshū Shokafu" notes that details are difficult to ascertain.

**Toda Ujimitsu** This person's son, Kichibei Ujimitsu, when Ieyasu attacked Yoshida Castle in Eiroku 7, despite his mother being held hostage by the Imagawa forces within the castle, devoted his strength to the Tokugawa side out of respect for generations of obligations, and subsequently faced numerous battlefields, reportedly sustaining wounds in about thirty-six places. He died on the eighth day of the ninth month of Tenshō 15 (or possibly 17) at age seventy-five, and his son was Kazuaki.

**Toda Kazuaki** This Kazuaki initially took names such as Masanari, Nobuyo, and Yasutugu, and was also called Shinjirō, Jūbei, Samon, and Uneme-no-shō. He was born at Yoshida in Tenbun 10. He had considerable military achievements for the Tokugawa clan, and finally established a castle at Zeze in Ōmi Province where he resided and controlled 30,000 koku, but died on the twenty-fifth day of the seventh month of Keichō 8 at age sixty-two.

However, as I mentioned much earlier, when Makino Denzō Nobushige was defeated serving Matsudaira Kiyoyasu...

...there were his younger brothers named Shinji and Shinzō. Shinji retreated to Ushikubo, but Shinzō fled to Hōgen Temple at Akaiwa in Yana District and later succeeded the Toda clan, calling himself Toda Samon. Toda Samon would correspond to this Kazuaki, but I believe this theory is completely unreliable. The timeline doesn't match, and there is other contradicting evidence, as discussed in the "Hankanfu" as I mentioned before.

**Maki Shinbei** It's possible that such legends arose from the fact that the Toda clan traditionally used the childhood name Shinjirō and that Ujimitsu's younger brother Ujiyoshi called himself Maki Shinbei, whose descendants became retainers of the main family. In any case, since this legend is still transmitted at places like Hōgen Temple, I wanted to add a word about it. There are still more things I'd like to discuss about Kazuaki, but I'll mention them gradually. Now, what was the situation at Ushikubo at that time?

**The Makino Party at Ushikubo** As I have repeatedly mentioned in previous chapters, the main figures were Narisada, ancestor of the Nagaoka Makino family, and Sadashige, ancestor of the Tanabe Makino family. Narisada is believed to have secretly communicated with the Tokugawa clan even during the Battle of Yoshida, and after the surrender of Yoshida Castle, both families openly joined the Tokugawa side. Narisada was initially called Shinjirō, later Minbu-no-jō or Uma-no-jō, and was quite powerful as the leader of the Makino party. However, he died at Ushikubo on the twenty-third day of the tenth month of Eiroku 9 at age forty-two.

**The Tomb of Makino Narisada** His grave still exists behind Kōki-an at Ushikubo. Although Narisada's tomb is also said to be at Yōrin Temple in Ōgo, Jōshū Province, this was probably moved there after the Makino family was enfeoffed at Ōgo in Tenshō 18, and he was actually buried at Ushikubo. The tombstone at Kōki-an was erected by his third-generation granddaughter in Jōkyō 1, and large pine trees still remain. However, after Narisada's death, there appears to have been a dispute over the inheritance, which was a lawsuit initiated by Dewa-no-kami Narimoto, son of the previously mentioned Dewa-no-kami Yasushige, but ultimately Narisada's son Shinjirō Yasunari succeeded through Ieyasu's judgment.

**Makino Shinjirō Yasunari** A document sent by Mizuno Shimotsuke-no-kami Nobumoto at this time is still preserved in the Nagaoka Makino family, and it contains the passage "Concerning the matter of Dewa-dono father and son's lawsuit about returning home from somewhere, etc."

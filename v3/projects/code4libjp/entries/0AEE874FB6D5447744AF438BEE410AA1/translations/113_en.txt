"...serving in attendance. Naiki's son is the maternal grandson of Matsudaira Kii-no-kami's daughter, so Kii-no-kami insisted that he should inherit the family name. However, Shojiro is already serving in the guard duties, and though this is the case, it was decided to grant him [the inheritance]. He has been managing Tonomo's territory until now, and Shojiro has been granted 5,000 koku in Nishi District and is called Matsudaira Genba-no-suke. Naiki's son is to be assisted by Genba."

Moreover, both Ieyasu and Tadakiyo, father and son, appear to have died what is commonly called sudden death, as recorded in the Sunpu-ki and Todai-ki:

[Sunpu-ki] April 22nd: Tonight it was reported that Matsudaira Genba-no-kami, lord of Yoshida Castle in Mikawa Province, died suddenly yesterday, etc.

[Todai-ki] April 20th: At the hour of the boar, Genba of Yoshida in Mikawa Province felt unwell and became speechless, then suddenly died at the hour of the rat. Last year his father Genba-no-kami [Ieyasu] died suddenly in the same manner - truly extraordinary.

Today, ridge plates bearing Ieyasu's name are preserved at both Shinmei Shrine in Naka-hachi, Oyaza of our city, and at Hogen-ji Temple in Akaiwa. Both date from Keicho 9 and are quite interesting. Also, from when Ieyasu was residing at this Yoshida, there is a document setting transport fees for the route between Goyu-Akasaka and this Yoshida, endorsed by Tokugawa magistrates, which is still preserved at the residence of Mr. Hayashi Kojiro in Goyu-machi, Hoi District. I think this is also quite fascinating, so I will present the full text below for reference:

(Front)
Record of Fixed Transport Fees
- From Koi to Akasaka: for cargo of one pack-horse load of 40 kan weight, 15 mon in worn coins; to Yoshida as well, 50 mon
- One rider is set at 18 kan weight; even small loads should be weighed and sent promptly according to this calculation

- Worn coins shall be exchanged at 6 mon per eiraku coin
These articles have been ordered by the magistrate's office, so this document is written as stated above.
Keicho 7th year    Naraya
June 10th         Ichiemon (seal)
                  Taruya
                  Sanshiro (seal)
To Koi-machi

(Back)
                  Okubo Jubei (seal)
                  Itakura Kikoemon (seal)
                  Kato Kizaemon (seal)
                  Ina Bizen-no-kami (seal)

This regulation document not only serves as reference for understanding the postal system of that time, but also shows the exchange rate between worn coins and eiraku coins, making it quite valuable. The Naraya and Taruya mentioned are probably Edo wholesalers who contracted the Tokaido postal service. The fact that the reverse side bears the official seals of officials including Ina Bizen-no-kami Tadatsugu gives us insight into the administrative practices of that time, which I found particularly interesting. Regarding the genealogy and careers of the father and son Ieyasu and Tadakiyo, I believe the records in the Kansei Revised Genealogies of Various Houses are reliable, so I will excerpt them below.

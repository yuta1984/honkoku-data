**Main Text:**
In addition to the above, the riverside regulations issued by the government must be strictly observed. Particularly during June, Ise pilgrims and boat operators have been reported to act arrogantly and selfishly, causing hardship for other passengers. Ship owners must be especially careful about this in the future. The general practice of allowing travelers aboard ships through direct negotiation between boatmen and passengers shall be discontinued. Following the above procedures, mutual inspection shall be conducted, reports made to the ship inspection station, recorded in ledgers, and only then shall ships depart. Those who violate these instructions shall be punished.

Kyōhō 6, Year of the Metal Snake, October - Town Administration Office

There are countless matters to discuss regarding Nobutoki's era, though there were no particularly major incidents.

**Nobutoki's Proclamation Before Sankin Attendance**
Fortunately, when Nobutoki was to attend sankin in Edo in July of Shōtoku 4, the instructions he issued to the domain regarding conduct during his absence are recorded in the official diary. These are remarkably thorough, and I definitely want to describe them.

This instruction document covers everything from castle gate guards to inner palace staff and even procedures for childbirth, truly showing Nobutoki's usual policies. Therefore, although it is quite lengthy, I will record the full text here. This alone should provide understanding of Nobutoki's general policies.

Memorandum

1. Observing the periods when lords of various castles and domains are absent, there is often natural negligence in all matters. Those in our house and domain must be mindful and work even harder during the lord's absence.

1. From high officials to magistrates, leaders, and lower-ranking officials, all must be attentive in their duties, caring for widows, widowers, orphans, and the solitary in the domain, ensuring they suffer no hunger or cold, and handling official business and lawsuits with complete integrity. However, those of low status may become arrogant from such kindness and cause harm instead. Those who break the law shall be swiftly punished severely.

Note: Decisions from deliberations of various officials need not all be reported to the senior retainers in Edo.

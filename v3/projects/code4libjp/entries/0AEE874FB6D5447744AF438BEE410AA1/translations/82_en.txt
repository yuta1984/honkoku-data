At the time of the Honnōji Incident, Ieyasu happened to be in Sakai in Settsu Province, but he hastily braved the difficulties of crossing through Iga, emerged at Ise, landed in Mikawa, and from there immediately gathered troops to launch a punitive expedition against Mitsuhide, advancing as far as Owari. However, he received news that Mitsuhide had already been defeated at Yamazaki and killed, so he disbanded his army, as I described previously.

At that time in Kōshū there was Kawajiri Higo-no-kami Shigeyoshi serving as guardian for the Oda clan. Ieyasu immediately sent Honda Momosuke to pay his respects. Though Kawajiri and Honda had previously been on intimate terms, at this time Kawajiri greatly suspected Honda's intentions and took advantage of his sleeping to stab him to death. However, the people of the province had been displeased with Kawajiri from the beginning, so uprisings broke out in various places and eventually killed Kawajiri as well, leaving Kōshū completely without a lord.

The province fell into great disorder, but Ieyasu seized this opportunity and sent Ōsuga Yasutaka and others leading troops to subjugate the territory. He subsequently sent Ōkubo Tadayo, Ishikawa Yasumitsu, the father and son Honda Hirotaka and others into battle, and before long the province was pacified, with many former retainers of the Takeda clan coming to submit.

However, around this time Mori Nagayoshi, an Oda general who was guarding Shinano, also heard of the Honnōji Incident and headed west, so that province too fell into disorder with no unifying authority. Uesugi Kagekatsu of Echigo sent troops to occupy the four districts of Kawanakajima, but Ieyasu also planned to send troops from Kōshū to pacify the region.

Thus in the seventh month of that year (Tenshō 10), Ieyasu personally led troops into Kōshū, established himself at Shinpu, and supervised military affairs in the two provinces of Kōshū. However, at this point the neighboring Hōjō Ujimasa could not remain silent, so he had his son Ujinao lead troops through Usui Pass into Shinshū, repeatedly clashing with Tokugawa forces. At this time Sakai Tadatsugu also led various generals and soldiers from eastern Mikawa into Shinshū and achieved many military successes, though there are stories of him quarreling with Ōkubo Tadayo over disagreements when they faced Hōjō forces at Kajigahara.

However, I think these details would be too lengthy, so I shall omit them all. Ultimately in the tenth month, Ieyasu and Ujinao made peace, with the Hōjō controlling Jōshū and Ieyasu incorporating the two provinces of Kōshū, and they agreed that Ujinao would marry Ieyasu's daughter Toku-hime.

In this way, Ieyasu came to possess not only the three provinces of Mikawa, Enshu, and Suruga, but also gained control of the two provinces of Kōshū. In the twelfth month he had Hiraiwa Chikayoshi guard Kōfu, Torii Mototada pacify Tsuru District in Kōshū, appointed Naruse Issai as Kōshū magistrate, and furthermore left Ōkubo Tadayo, Suganuma Daizen and others in Kōshū to defend against Shinshū, while he himself returned to Hamamatsu. In this way Ieyasu's power gradually dominated the Tōkai region and his prestige increased ever more.

Roughly speaking, this was the situation: while the Oda clan was embroiled in internal strife between Nobuo and Nobutaka over succession issues, Ieyasu newly pacified the two provinces of Kōshū and made them his territory, essentially gaining the fisherman's profit. At that time his relationship with Hideyoshi appeared extremely amicable.

Indeed, when Hideyoshi defeated Shibata Katsuie, Ieyasu sent Ishikawa Kazumasa as an envoy bearing the famous tea bowl "Hatsuhana" to congratulate him on his victory, and Hideyoshi in turn petitioned on Ieyasu's behalf to have him appointed to Junior Third Rank and the position of Councilor, ranks higher than Hideyoshi's own, showing how he sought Ieyasu's favor.

However, the cause of the conflict that arose here was the relationship between Nobuo and Hideyoshi. Initially when Nobutaka plotted against Hideyoshi but found himself in desperate straits instead, as I mentioned before, Nobuo rather saw this as beneficial to himself and not only failed to rescue Nobutaka but facilitated his destruction. However, now that Nobutaka was destroyed, he found himself in the isolated position described by the saying "when the lips are gone, the teeth feel cold."

Hideyoshi, learning from Nobutaka's situation and thinking that Nobuo would be the next to repeat this pattern, wanted somehow to eliminate him. As one strategy he sowed discord between Nobuo and his senior retainers Okada Shigetaka, Tsugawa Yoshifuyu, and Asai Nagatoki. But Nobuo was quite shallow in his thinking, so he ultimately fell for this scheme, killed these three senior retainers, and broke with Hideyoshi.

However, Nobuo's strength was insufficient to oppose Hideyoshi, so he requested assistance from Ieyasu. At this time Hideyoshi also made various overtures trying to win over Ieyasu. But Ieyasu rejected Hideyoshi's proposals, citing both old friendship and their status as neighboring domains...

Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Nobuaki and the Conditions of Yoshida During His Time as Lord) 362

**Main Text:**
...on February 2nd at age twenty-six he was first appointed as a personal aide (sobayōnin), and on April 4th of that same year, he suddenly leaped to join the ranks of senior councilors (rōjū). Originally this promotion was truly exceptional, with absolutely no comparable precedent, but this was entirely due to the recommendation of Sadanobu. Sadanobu later once said to someone: "Though I hold heavy responsibilities, there is nothing I can boast of. I have only found one worthy man and advanced him. I hope this will absolve me of my faults." This "one worthy man" he spoke of obtaining was indeed referring to Nobuaki. From then on, Nobuaki devoted all his efforts to assisting Sadanobu's administration, but from then until December 22, Kyōwa 3 (1803) was approximately sixteen years, at which point he once retired from his position. From then until May of Bunka 3 (1806), for about two and a half years, he remained in an idle position. However, on the 25th of that month, he was again appointed as senior councilor and took the senior seat, once more wielding great influence in the realm for over eleven years, until he died of illness while still in office on August 16, Bunka 14 (1817). His age at death was fifty-five, but in the previous chapter, due to some error, the type was set as fifty-eight, so I would like to take this opportunity to correct this.

**Nobuaki's Constitution**
For these reasons, Nobuaki served as lord of this Yoshida for approximately forty-seven years, and during that time also served as the nation's chief administrator for nearly twenty-eight years in total, so it is natural that his achievements were numerous. Originally, Nobuaki had an extremely frail constitution as a child. When he turned thirteen, though he should have had an audience with the shogun according to custom, due to having accumulated qi illness from childhood and frequent bowel movements, he could not endure sitting for long periods, so this was postponed until he finally had his first audience in March at age fifteen. Therefore, it is believed he was not of particularly robust health throughout his life. However, as I have repeatedly mentioned before, he was a person of extremely outstanding energy. During this long period, he frequently obtained leave to return to his domain, and while in residence he paid particular attention to local administrative affairs. When he resigned from the senior councilor position and remained in residence for almost a full year from June of Bunka 2 until May of the following year, he greatly promoted both literary and martial arts within the domain, and stories of this are still passed down among elderly people today.

**Nobuaki's Funeral**
Also, when Nobuaki died, during his illness he received frequent inquiries about his health from the shogun, but his death was announced on August 28th, and from the next day...

...until September 1st, the cessation of music was ordered. The funeral was held on September 2nd, and the next day he was buried next to the ancestral graves at Heirinji Temple in Nobidomari. His posthumous name was Zuiryūin-den Kan'ō Gentoku Daokoji. I should add here that during his lifetime, Nobuaki used the alternate name Sugaku, but in his youth he was called Saihō.

Given these circumstances, during the long period when Nobuaki served as castle lord, various events must have occurred in this Yoshida. However, while materials concerning Nobuaki's own achievements are remarkably abundant, it is regrettable that very few other materials remain. Concerning those major points that are understood, I plan to discuss them gradually from now on.

**Establishment of Jishūkan**
First, what I would like to discuss here is the matter of Jishūkan. As you all know, this Jishūkan was the domain school of Yoshida domain, which continued to exist in this Toyohashi until the time of the Restoration. The person who established this domain school was, as I briefly mentioned before, Nobuaki's grandfather Nobunao. As you already know, this person called Nobunao studied under Miura Chikkei, so his learning encompassed ancient and modern times, and he especially devoted himself to loving the worthy and promoting talent. This person's collected prose and poetry still remain with the Ōkōchi family, and having recently examined them, I believe there are quite remarkable things worth preserving in his collected works. I shall discuss this at another opportunity, but in any case, being such a wise person, he had long harbored aspirations for promoting learning. When he was transferred from Hamamatsu to this Yoshida, he soon established a domain school and named it Jishūkan. This occurred in Hōreki 2 (1752). At this time, Nobunao commanded his senior retainer Kitahara Chūbei to write the academy's name on a plaque. Chūbei's given name was Tadamitsu, and he was the domain's skilled calligrapher at the time. Moreover, this plaque existed until after the Restoration, and later when Toyohashi town established a middle school and gave it the name Jishūkan, I recall that they took that same plaque and hung it in the entrance hall. I wonder whether it has now been inherited by the prefectural Fourth Middle School—if it fortunately still exists, I think I would like to preserve it as a memorial in Toyohashi's newly established library or somewhere similar. Also, the academy's regulations from that time remain...

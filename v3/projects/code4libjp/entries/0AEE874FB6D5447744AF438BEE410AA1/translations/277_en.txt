　　　　　　　　　　threw himself to his death by suicide. Sakaki obtained what was called Man-nosuke's written statement - the "Statement of Purpose for Eliminating Traitors" - and entrusted it to his disciple Kamei Magoroku (later changed his name to Yamamoto Hayao; his biography is on a separate sheet, please be sure to refer to it) who sent it to Takebei and others.

　　　　　　　As the cold weather gradually intensifies, I congratulate you on your continued good health. The other day, regarding the plaque requested by Kuraki Dayū, when you petitioned Lord Sanjō, he quickly took up his brush and submitted it to Sanzō-en. I immediately brought it to Kuraki-kun, who repeatedly asked me to convey his deepest gratitude for the prompt calligraphy, saying it was extremely honorable. Please be aware of this. Also, the calligraphy for "Waraku" has been completed and matches the characters "Kawa," which is most congratulatory. We hope that the Hamana Bridge inscription will also be completed after thorough review and approval. On your return journey, if it is convenient, please fulfill the request made earlier for a celebratory poem for the library completion banquet anthology. Hōu has also repeatedly mentioned this matter. Please make every effort. I wanted to mention these matters first. Written hastily and incompletely.
　　　　　　　　　　November 23rd　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Tokiwa
　　　　　　　　　　　　Mr. Takebei
　　　　　　　(Note) This letter appears to be from Bunkyū 2 (1862), and "Lord Sanjō" refers to Sanjō Sanetomi, who stayed at Takebei's house in October of that year while traveling eastward as an imperial messenger. The phrase "on your return journey, etc." in the text refers to the occasion of his return journey.

　　　　　　　I have come to your area accompanying my neighbor Kunisaku Ishikawa-kun, and take this good opportunity to write to you. Although it is the severe cold season, I trust that you are all safe and well. Here too

　　　　　　　we are all without incident and living peacefully, which is most congratulatory. I understand that you too have been in seclusion for a long time, and I sympathize with your pressing difficulties. Details are in the detailed letter. Regarding Hikobei's speech, I accompanied him and made detailed arrangements with Mr. Yasu, and I believe Hiko-kun has informed you of what was readily accepted. It should not become a particularly public matter. I pray from the shadows that you will resolve this matter within the year. Please let me know about recent developments.
　　　　　　　  First, the other day a person named Okada Izō from Tosa domain came to inquire, and he told a story that on the night of the 16th, the Russian, British, American, and French legations in Yokohama were destroyed by fire, and a person called the British minister's elder brother, a merchant leader named Gaa, was stabbed to death and his head was displayed in Kanagawa. He said that the same person also stayed one night at your house, and that there were also others including Kawabe-san and Kitazoe-san, and that thirteen people traveled together to Kyoto, and they would also request to stay one night at your house. However, there is no such rumor elsewhere. I wonder if they stopped by your house as well? Please let me know whether this is true or false.
　　　　　　　First, the day before, Koyama Suikei also stopped by Yokoyama and said he very much wanted to meet with this old man, but we missed each other and did not meet. Regarding the date of departure for Kyoto, Koyama said by warship within this year, and Okada said late January next year. However, since they are definitely departing on the 26th, and Ishikawa-kun also set out today, I believe there is no mistake. Truly, those staying in the countryside face extraordinary duties, and wealthy farmers are greatly troubled - quite a few have gone bankrupt, which is most lamentable. In contrast, day laborers in towns or those in rural areas who hold tax-exempt land gain considerable profit and are all peaceful. I imagine your area is probably the same. What an unexpected state of society - truly a world where selfishness prevails.
  　　　　　　　First, yesterday I received a letter dated the 14th from Mr. Hirata. I inquired about various matters in the Kamigata region, but the private circumstances are completely unclear. Everyone says that there will certainly be a major transformation before long.
　　　　　　　First, twelve volumes of "Historical Poetry" in three fascicles have been published, but they say it is difficult to send them due to transportation difficulties - what an inconvenient world

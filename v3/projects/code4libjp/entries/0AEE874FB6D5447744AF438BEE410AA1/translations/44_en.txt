It is traditionally said that Yoshimoto established these regulations, and this too is probably factual. Originally, the Kumano Gongen Shrine now in Omaza Uomachi was located in Omaza Fudagi, and fish markets were held within its precincts, with 20% of the market fees being allocated to shrine building construction costs. This matter is also recorded in a document given by Tokugawa Ieyasu's retainer Ina Bizen-no-kami Tadatsugu to the shrine priests of this Gongen shrine in Keicho 6. While the original of this document no longer exists, it contains the phrase "from ancient times" and so forth, which confirms that both the Gongen shrine and the fish market already existed during Yoshimoto's time.

Therefore, the claim that Yoshimoto established regulations for this market when he came to rule this area is not entirely unbelievable. Regarding post horses, there remains a regulation document by Yoshimoto in the home of Mr. Hayashi Kojiro in Goyu-machi, Hoi District. This dates from Eiroku 1, and its full text is as follows:

(Yoshimoto's monogram)
Regarding the post horses of this station: In Tenbun 23, five articles were decided with official seals, but as there are reports that the rate of 10 sen per ri is not being observed, the following articles are hereby reestablished:
1. No matter what official business or urgent border matters arise, post horses shall not be provided to those who do not pay 10 sen per ri.
2. Beyond the daily five horses, the rate shall be 15 sen per ri.
3. Even when this deputy official has supporting documents, 10 sen per ri shall be collected.
   Note: When post horses are not provided due to non-payment of 10 sen per ri, even if cargo is forced through, this shall not be permitted. Even if cargo is lost, this shall not be considered the townspeople's fault.

These articles shall be observed without deviation as in the previous decree. If there are any violators, their names shall be reported. Thus decreed.
Eiroku 1, year of the earth horse, 8th month, 16th day

From this, it appears that regulations in five articles had already been promulgated in Tenbun 23, and this regulation document was reissued in this year.

The post horse rates were set at 10 sen per ri for up to five horses, with six or more horses allowed to charge 15 sen each. However, the regulation that those handling post horses bore no responsibility for cargo belonging to people who forced their goods through without paying fees is quite noteworthy.

Now, turning to the political situation in the eastern Mikawa region at that time, there were powerful families in what is now North and South Shitara Districts, known as the "Yamaga Sanpo" (Three Mountain Houses). These were the Okudaira clan of Tsukude, the Suganuma clan of Tamine, and the Suganuma clan of Noda. Later, when a castle was built at Nagashino and a branch of the Tamine line resided there, sometimes Tsukude, Tamine, and Nagashino were collectively called the Yamaga Sanpo.

In any case, the Okudaira and Suganuma clans were dominant powers in northern eastern Mikawa. Other notable families included the Shitara clan of Shitara, the Saigo clan of Saigo, in Hoi District the Honda clan of Ina, the Udono clan of Nishi-no-kori, and the Matsudaira clans of Fukamizo, Katanohara, Takenotani, and other places. Ushikubo was the stronghold of the Makino clan, but one of their branches also resided in Ina. The Iwase clan residing in Otsuka is also believed to have been related to them.

These people either gave their hearts to the Imagawa clan or served the Matsudaira clan of Okazaki completely. Until the Matsudaira house's restoration, they had no choice but to submit to Imagawa domination. The Makino clan of Ushikubo, for instance, was quite close to the Imagawa clan, while the Honda clan of Ina and the Suganuma clan of Noda had long distinguished themselves in loyal service to the Matsudaira clan.

However, the Suganuma of Tamine and Nagashino, along with the Okudaira clan of Tsukude, seemed to consider it more advantageous to establish relations with the Oda clan, and were sometimes attacked by the Imagawa clan for this reason - such was the general situation.

The famous renga poet Sohaku's "Eastern Journey Record" also describes this region during that time. Renga was still quite popular in this period, and renga poets constantly traveled between warrior households, with performances being held frequently. In the Eastern Journey Record's entry for the 12th month of Tenbun 13:
"Until meeting the welcoming party from Ushikubo, Totaro, Matazaburo and others all traveled on horseback to a village called Otsuka, where in ancient times [someone] stayed..."

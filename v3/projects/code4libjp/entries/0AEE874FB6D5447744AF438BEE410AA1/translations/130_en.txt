Item: Regarding inspection of the harbor boat superintendent, we hold this matter of great importance as stated in the official notice board, establishing a boat station and performing duties without negligence. Twenty-four years ago, when Lords Sakai Hachirōbei and Ban Sakuhei toured various provincial harbors for inspection, they inquired about the historical background of our harbor, and when we reported these details, they ordered us to be even more careful in boat inspections and gave us a copy of the official notice. End.

Regarding the above tax exemption for Funamachi and inspection of various duties, these have been performed as handed down from ancient times and continue to this day as stated above. End.

**Nagasuke's Death**
Now, Nagasuke died the following year on the 17th day of the 6th month of Genroku 3 [1690] at the age of 47, with the Buddhist name Danshi-in Betsuhō Sōken Koji, and his grave is also at Rinzai Temple.

**Ogasawara Nagashige**
Since Nagasuke's son had died young, on the 7th day of the 7th month of Jōkyō 2 [1685] he adopted his younger brother Nagashige as his son. This person now succeeded him and received his adoptive father's domain on the 10th day of the 10th month of Genroku 3 [1690].

Nagashige was born in Keian 3 [1650]. On the 11th day of the 7th month of Kanbun 10 [1670] he became a page in the inner palace, on the 8th day of the 12th month he was granted 500 hyō of stipend rice, on the 25th day of the 4th month of the 12th year he was transferred to personal attendant, and on the 28th day of the 12th month he was appointed to junior 5th rank, lower grade, Governor of Sado. On the 6th day of the 7th month of Tenna 1 [1681] he became head of the library guard and on the 21st day of the 5th month of the 2nd year he was granted 1,500 hyō.

As mentioned before, since his elder brother Nagasuke had no living son, he became his adopted son and eventually succeeded him. Thereafter, on the 3rd day of the 12th month of Genroku 3 he became a presenter and concurrently served as magistrate of temples and shrines. On the 26th day of the intercalary 8th month of the 4th year he advanced to Kyoto deputy and was promoted to junior 4th rank, lower grade, chamberlain. Then on the 19th day of the 4th month of the 10th year he was appointed senior councilor with an increase of 10,000 koku, but

**Nagashige Transferred to Iwatsuki Castle in Musashi**
simultaneously he was ordered to transfer domains to Iwatsuki Castle in Musashi Province, so the Ogasawara clan, which had continued as lords of this place for a relatively considerable time, was once again to relocate elsewhere.

**Supplement**
Now I would like to briefly mention something as a supplement. In the previous chapter where I discussed the genealogy under "Ogasawara Iki-no-kami," I mentioned that Tadatomo's great-grandfather Nagatoki was at Fukashi Castle during the Tenbun era [1532-1555] when he was defeated by Takeda Shingen and fled to Echigo. This was mainly based on records in the Hankanfu, but upon further investigation, it turns out that "Fukashi Castle" was an error - in fact, Nagatoki was stationed at a place called Chūtō.

The Ogasawara clan first obtained Fukashi Castle during the time of Nagatoki's son Sadayoshi in Tenshō 10 [1582]. At that time, Sadayoshi is said to have changed the name from Fukashi to Matsumoto.

Originally, Sadayoshi was Nagatoki's third son, but he temporarily restored his father's fortunes. However, he ultimately faced adversity again, but his son Hidemasa later served under Tokugawa Ieyasu with many military achievements, so in the 10th month of Keichō 18 [1613] he regained his former domain of Matsumoto. Regrettably, on the 7th day of the 5th month of Genna 1 [1615], he died in battle at Tennōji during the Osaka campaign.

His wife was the daughter of the well-known Okazaki Saburō Nobuyasu and thus Ieyasu's granddaughter. Hidemasa had several sons, and his eldest son Tadamune also died in battle alongside his father at Osaka. However, his second son Tadasane was severely wounded but fortunately survived and succeeded his father. Meanwhile, Tadamune's son Nagatsugu was also later elevated to the ranks of feudal lords and established his own house. The Tadatomo who became lord of Yoshida was, as previously mentioned, Hidemasa's third son, so from Hidemasa's lineage, three houses of the Ogasawara family achieved feudal lord status.

From today's perspective, Tadasane's successors were the Kokura lords at the time of the Restoration and are now a count family, while the others are both viscount families. As for the successors of the Yoshida lords, they were the Karatsu lords at the time of the Restoration, and the current heir is Navy Captain Ogasawara Chōsei.

Furthermore, the Ogasawara family produced a work called "Ryūkei Taisei," which is quite voluminous but provides very detailed and excellent coverage of the family's

Appointed to the position of courtier (jiju)　　　　　　Toda Yamashiro-no-kami
The same　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Hori Yamato-no-kami

*Marginal note: Yamato-no-kami was appointed to the council of senior advisors, but due to repeated refusals, he continues his previous duties and was appointed as courtier*

The above appointments were made between June 10th and today.
Lord Doi has withdrawn and his attendance at court is difficult. These are truly gloomy affairs.

First, regarding the arrival of foreign enemy ships at Nagasaki, on the 29th of last month express messengers came from Lord Chikuzen with urgent reports, and on the same day messengers from Lords Nabeshima and Omura also passed through. The Chikuzen messenger passed through from Miya post station via Shinisumi, and when I inquired at Arai, I learned that Lord Nabeshima had already dispatched troops and Lord Chikuzen had also sent advance forces. The messenger departed carrying official documents, though I did not learn which country's ships or how many vessels were involved. According to the Satsuma messenger's account, the fleet numbers approximately 178 ships in three divisions, and it appears that Ryukyu has already been taken. However, this may not be factual, but there is no doubt that enemy ships have arrived, and they are certainly believed to be British vessels - this is indeed a grave matter.

In recent years, that country (Britain) has been waging war against China, which finally ended in peace. Seven trading ports were established in China, with an agreement that China would pay Britain 2 million ryo of gold annually at each port. Even though China is a great nation, paying such amounts yearly will eventually weaken the country and lead to internal rebellion - this was reported to our government by Chinese merchants last year. This is truly frightening and lamentable, and we earnestly hope for peaceful resolution. This is written as a seasonal greeting. Please give my regards to everyone. My family also sends their regards. Written hastily and incompletely.

(Note) This letter was sent by Sakaki to his family home, the Yamamoto household, and dates to around Ansei 1 (1854). It demonstrates that Sakaki was constantly concerned with national affairs at that time.

Privately heard poems of the retired lord:

"White hair, aged face, beyond myriad flowers
Lifelong fierce spirit not yet fully quelled
The precious sword struggles to be stained with Western barbarian blood
Instead I think of the old grass hut in my homeland"

"Let the floating clouds gather as they will
The autumn night's moon reflected
In the mirror of this world"

A poem by Umeda Genjiro:
"With a heart devoted single-mindedly to our sovereign's reign..."

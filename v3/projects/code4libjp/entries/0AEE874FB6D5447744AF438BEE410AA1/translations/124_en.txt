...are points that I believe merit consideration. In the fourth month of that fourth year, Shogun Iemitsu passed away, and Ietsuna succeeded him, becoming the fourth shogun. The famous rebellion of Yui Shōsetsu occurred in this year, during what could be called the height of the era of the well-known Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobutsuna's power. The Keian era continued for four years before changing to Jōō, which lasted only two years before becoming Meireki. Meireki also lasted three years before becoming Manji, and Manji similarly lasted three years before becoming Kanbun. On July 26 of Kanbun 3 (though the Hankanfu records it as the 29th), Tadatomo died at the age of 65. His grave still exists today at Rinzai-ji temple in Futsurenji, but originally this Rinzai-ji temple was built by Tadatomo when he was still at Kitsuki, and shortly after his transfer to Yoshida, he moved this temple here as well. The Mikawa Kikigaki records this as having occurred in Jōō 2.

Initially, this temple was called Sōgen-ji and was located in Akumi, but it is said that in the year following Tadatomo's death—that is, in Kanbun 4—his eldest son Naganori moved and rebuilt it at its present location for his father's spiritual benefit. The founding abbot of this Rinzai-ji was a person called Zen Master Nittō Gen'yō, who was quite famous.

This person was born in Shiraishi, Hizen Province, and at age nine entered a temple called Fukusen-ji in his hometown to become a monk. Later he traveled in all directions and entered Ryūkō-ji in Ise Province, where he studied under a monk called Kohaku Daisen for seven years. One day while reading the Engaku Sutra, he achieved great enlightenment, and his master Kohaku finally granted him certification. This certification is still preserved at Rinzai-ji today. Afterward, the Zen master went to Edo and resided at Ryūkō-ji in Komagome, receiving considerable devotion from the third shogun Iemitsu. So when Ogasawara Tadatomo first built Sōgen-ji at Kitsuki as mentioned earlier, he invited this person to be its founder, and when the temple was moved to this location, the Zen master also came to reside there. According to temple records, he died in the tenth month of Kanbun 7 at the age of 77.

While I'm on the subject, I'd like to mention briefly that the temple called Jingū-ji in the large district of Kon'ya was, according to temple tradition, rebuilt and renamed in Keichō 1 by a monk called Jūshin, who restored an old temple called Chōzen-ji that had existed from ancient times. This monk Jūshin was originally of the Kokubo family, born in Chita District, Owari Province...

...and died in the second month of Kanbun 20. A document dated the second day of the sixth month of Jōō 2, issued by Kōkai Dai-sōjō, the monzeki of Bishamon-dō, determining this temple's rank, still remains at the temple today. This occurred during Tadatomo's time as castle lord, and as it provides valuable material for temple history, I present it here.

Also, in the large district of Kawaramachi, there remains a record called "Kawaramachi Development Memorandum," which I believe was written down after the Enkyō period, and contains quite valuable reference material. This record details the early development of Kawaramachi, and includes the following passage:

"Item: In Kanbun 2, the year of the Tiger, during the reign of the former Ogasawara Iki-no-kami, Oya Yahachirō of Nitsurengi village petitioned to establish a new village, but permission to establish the new village was not granted, and the matter remained unresolved. In the following year of the Rabbit, Iki-no-kami passed away and the house was succeeded by Yamashiro-no-kami. In Kanbun 4, the year of the Dragon, when the family temple Rinzai-ji was built in Nitsurengi village, the deputy magistrate of that time, Aizawa Kan'emon, announced that since the family temple was being built in this village, any petitions would be favorably considered. Therefore, we petitioned again for the establishment of a new village. Although it was a difficult matter, since this was a repeated petition, we were told we could proceed at our discretion. In the Dragon year, land was cleared and lots were divided, with about twenty farmers settled on both sides from Jūō Hill to the eastern slope entrance, with residences set back slightly from the highway and enclosed in spacious plots. However, many people from the town and countryside desired lots and petitioned the lord, who then ordered that houses be built along the highway to form a proper town. The lots were redistributed three times to create a proper townscape."

From this, we can clearly understand the circumstances when Kawaramachi was first established, and at the same time, we can perceive that establishing new villages was not easily permitted in those days. We can also learn about the rapid development of new settlements and the influx of many settlers. While this record contains much more that would serve as reference material, I think it would be too detailed to continue, so I will end this topic here and proceed to discuss the famous tea master Yamada Sōhen.

This year of Kaei 7 was, as you all know, the year when the era name was changed to Ansei, and it was an extremely memorable year for our country's diplomatic history. Namely, only seven days after the Russian ships left Nagasaki, American envoy Perry again entered Edo Bay leading a fleet of several ships.

Prior to this, Perry had temporarily left our country and was in Hong Kong, but he had been constantly gathering intelligence about recent conditions in our country and was aware of the Russian ships' entry into port. It appears he thought this situation could not be left unattended, so in December of the previous year he had already set sail for Ryukyu, where he left some soldiers to make thorough preparations, and finally arrived at Edo Bay.

However, this time he would not consent to remaining at Uraga and immediately proceeded into the inner bay, anchoring nine ships in total majestically off Kanagawa, which greatly surprised our countrymen. Given such circumstances, the national sentiment at the time was truly at a boiling point. But as I mentioned before, at that time only a very small number of people were familiar with foreign affairs, so naturally the majority held to maintaining ancestral laws and advocated national isolation and expelling foreigners. Therefore, on November 1st of last year, Kaei 6, the shogunate, through Ise-no-kami receiving imperial orders, issued the following proclamation to the lords attending the castle regarding the American problem.

The main points were: even if the American envoy comes again to urge trade, they should somehow find pretexts to delay a definitive answer, not reveal whether requests for friendship and trade would be granted, and have them withdraw. While they should implement peaceful measures as much as possible, since there was no guarantee the foreigners wouldn't resort to violence, all daimyo should strengthen their defenses, endure loyal indignation, store up righteous courage, carefully observe their movements, and if hostilities should break out, all should unite in determination and spare no effort, high and low together, to avoid staining the national honor.

Furthermore, various other preparations were planned, and notably Mito Nariakira was heavily involved in this. Under such circumstances, the position of Ise-no-kami and other shogunate officials was to restrain reckless public opinion internally while suppressing foreign demands externally. Their difficulties are truly worthy of sympathy even when considered from today's perspective.

I believe.

So when Perry's second voyage finally materialized, the shogunate's reception committee consisted of Hayashi Daigaku-no-kami Akira, Town Magistrate Ido Tsushima-no-kami Gakuhiro, Inspector Udono Minbu-no-sho Chōei, Confucian scholar Matsuzaki Mantarō, and Uraga Magistrate Izawa Mimasaka-no-kami Masayoshi. The meeting place was decided as Kanagawa according to Perry's wishes, and a temporary meeting hall like the previous year was constructed, where negotiations began on February 10th of this year.

However, at this time Perry did not deeply press for the commencement of trade, but only sought the conclusion of a treaty of friendship. Not only were his demands relatively moderate, but Perry's show of force was so overwhelming that the shogunate, completely contrary to their initial expectations, had no choice but to accept, and as you all know, they concluded a treaty with roughly the following main points.

Namely, the main points of this Kanagawa Treaty were: First, regarding treatment of castaways, whereas previously they had been treated as enemies and subjected to imprisonment and confinement, henceforth they should receive benevolent and generous treatment. Second, when food, firewood, charcoal and other supplies are lacking aboard ship, they should be supplied upon request at any time, with payment always to be made. Third, ports where American ships may call shall be, in addition to Nagasaki, Hakodate and Shimoda in Izu from March of next year. Fourth, at both Shimoda and Hakodate, American nationals may land and walk about, with the distance being seven ri for Shimoda and to be determined after investigation for Hakodate. Fifth, regarding Perry's request that American officials be permitted to reside at Shimoda to resolve disputes between the two nations' peoples and advance mutual interests, it was decided that after eighteen months both sides would consult further, and if it proved absolutely necessary, this would be permitted.

Perry had made two or three other demands, but these were gradually withdrawn, and the above-mentioned points were to be concluded as a treaty. After repeated discussions of the draft, it finally became a twelve-article treaty of friendship signed on March 3rd.

However, this treaty could be called truly unprecedented for that time, so someone like Mito Nariakira...

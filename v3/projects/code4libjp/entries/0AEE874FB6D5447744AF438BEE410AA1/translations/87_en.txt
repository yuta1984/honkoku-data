These matters are recorded in the Butoku Hennen Shūsei (Chronological Collection of Military Virtues). This person's portrait, painted by Kanō Naonobu, is also preserved in the same family today.

⦿ The Peace Between Hideyoshi, Nobuo, and Ieyasu

Returning to our earlier narrative, Hideyoshi saw that there was absolutely no opportunity to gain advantage over the Eastern Army in the Komaki confrontation. He stationed Hori Hidemasa, Katō Mitsuyasu and others at Gakuden and Inuyama, while he himself led 60,000 troops on the first day of the fifth month, withdrew to Mino, then entered western Owari where he attacked and captured the castles of Kaganoi in Niwa District and Takegahana. From there he proceeded to Ōgaki, entered western Ōmi on the 21st, and finally returned to Osaka on the 28th.

On the Eastern Army's side, Nobuo returned once to Nagashima Castle on May 3rd, while Ieyasu remained alone at Komaki. On June 12th, he left Sakai Tadatsugu there and entered Kiyosu Castle himself. However, Maeda Tanetoshi, who was left in charge of Kanie Castle, betrayed the Eastern Army and let in Takigawa Kazumasu, attempting to cut communications between Nagashima and Kiyosu. Ieyasu and Nobuo attacked this castle, Tanetoshi was killed, and Kazumasu fled to Ise. After such disturbances, Owari ultimately came under Eastern Army control.

Hideyoshi again departed Osaka on August 15th and entered Owari, and this time too Ieyasu and Nobuo took the field. However, the two armies merely confronted each other, and Hideyoshi was again unable to achieve his objectives. At this time peace negotiations arose between the armies but failed to reach agreement. Hideyoshi moved to Ōgaki on September 17th and returned to Osaka on October 6th. Ieyasu and Nobuo also entered Kiyosu on September 27th, and on the 17th, Ieyasu returned to Okazaki while Nobuo returned to Nagashima.

Thus Hideyoshi repeatedly came and encamped in Owari but somehow could not achieve his aims. In October he changed his route and moved into Ise, establishing camp at Hazu on the 23rd. Oda Nobuo, who was at Nagashima, heard of this and was greatly alarmed, urgently reporting to Kiyosu. At that time Sakai Tadatsugu was stationed at Kiyosu, so he immediately informed Ieyasu at Okazaki...

...of this development. Consequently, Ieyasu took the field at Kiyosu on November 9th and sent Tadatsugu and others to Kuwana to relieve Nobuo. At this time, Hideyoshi again sent Tomita Tomonobu and Tsuda Nobukatsu as envoys to negotiate peace with Nobuo. Nobuo finally agreed to this, though there are alternative theories about this peace - some say it was Nobuo who approached Hideyoshi for peace. However, the theory that Hideyoshi himself promoted it, being urgent about unifying the realm, seems more credible.

In any case, on the 11th, Hideyoshi and Nobuo met at Yada-gawara, where Hideyoshi treated Nobuo with great courtesy. Nobuo earnestly requested that Hideyoshi make peace with Ieyasu as well, and Hideyoshi had always desired reconciliation with Ieyasu. So he returned to Sakamoto on the 17th and then entered Kyoto, while his envoys reached Hamamatsu on the 21st to meet with Ieyasu and conduct peace talks.

Earlier, on the 12th, Ieyasu had received word from Sakai Tadatsugu that peace had been made between Hideyoshi and Nobuo. On the 16th he sent Ishikawa Kazumasa to the camps of both Nobuo and Hideyoshi to offer congratulations, entered Okazaki himself that day, and returned to Hamamatsu on the 21st.

The peace between Hideyoshi and Ieyasu was also concluded, with Ieyasu agreeing to send his son Ogimaru as Hideyoshi's adopted son. On December 12th, Ieyasu had Ishikawa Kazumasa escort Ogimaru to Osaka, and Nobuo is said to have greatly exerted himself as an intermediary in these arrangements.

However, the calculations of both heroes, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu, during this period are truly worth examining - both sides were quite skillful indeed.

Originally, this war arose from the conflict between Hideyoshi and Nobuo, as I mentioned before, and Ieyasu was assisting out of duty in response to Nobuo's request. Yet Nobuo, when in trouble, borrowed Ieyasu's strength to oppose Hideyoshi, but when it came to making peace, he shook hands with the enemy quite arbitrarily without proper consultation with Ieyasu - from our perspective, this seems rather selfish behavior. But there was Ieyasu...

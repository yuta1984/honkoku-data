However, this secret letter unfortunately fell into the hands of shogunate officials, which further intensified the shogunate's hatred of Mito domain. In this way, not only had the facts of Mito retainers and those activists calling themselves "imperial loyalists" repeatedly opposing shogunate policies been gradually exposed, but as always happens in such situations, among these people there were not only sincere individuals but also quite a few of the usual dissolute and lawless types who arbitrarily donned the mask of imperial loyalty and delighted in creating confusion throughout the realm. Therefore, the shogunate felt compelled to gradually take decisive action in pursuing its convictions.

At this point, Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami departed Edo on September 3rd and traveled to Kyoto via the Kisoji route. But before his arrival in Kyoto, another upheaval occurred there. The center of political power in the court was the position of Regent, and the current Regent Kujō held the principle of court-shogunate harmony as mentioned repeatedly before, making him extremely inconvenient for those absolutely opposed to the shogunate.

**Kujō Regent's Resignation**
Therefore, for the anti-shogunate faction to act as they wished, they first needed to bring this key position under their control. So finally on September 1st and 2nd, they advised Kujō to resign from his position. Consequently, Kujō was compelled to resign from the regency. This information was immediately reported to Edo via Shimada Sakon through Nagano, and Great Elder Ii's shock upon hearing this was immeasurable.

**The Resolve of Great Elder Ii and the Cabinet**
With the situation having reached this state, Great Elder Ii and the other cabinet members resolved deeply in their hearts. On the 11th, they sent a letter to Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami, who was en route to Kyoto, reporting the situation in Kyoto while also conveying the cabinet's determination. Namely, even though Regent Kujō had submitted his resignation, his retirement was not yet finalized, so in this critical matter concerning national security, they must by all means use Kujō's influence to reach the Emperor's ears and clarify that the shogunate had never shown contempt for the imperial court or arbitrarily signed treaties without waiting for imperial permission.

In any case, until then it was absolutely necessary to arrange for Kujō's continued service, but to achieve this they were compelled to resolve that they must crush the enemy forces even if it meant arresting the rōshi activists in Kyoto.

At this time in Kyoto, the newly arrived Kyoto Deputy Sakai Wakasa-no-kami had already heard from the court messengers on the morning of the 4th about Regent Kujō's resignation, and was told that there was imperial intention to appoint Konoe as minister with regent proclamation, and was instructed to convey this to the shogunate. So Sakai Wakasa-no-kami reported this to Edo while also urgently informing Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami, who was traveling, adding his own opinion. Shimōsa-no-kami's opinion upon receiving this was essentially the same—that regarding this new regent proclamation, they should delay the shogunate's response as much as possible and handle the matter in the meantime, as there was no other way to proceed. This presumably aligned with Great Elder Ii's thinking as well.

**The Arrest of Umeda Genjirō**
Earlier, Nagano Shuzen had returned to Hikone and was then staying secretly in Ōtsu, observing the situation in Kyoto. On the night of the 5th, Shimada Sakon came secretly to meet with him and gradually clarified the circumstances in Kyoto. They became convinced that the source of court agitation was definitely these rōshi activists, and their ringleader was Umeda Genjirō, as briefly mentioned earlier, so they felt it necessary to arrest him first.

When this was recommended to Kyoto Deputy Sakai, Wakasa-no-kami initially agreed. However, Kyoto Town Magistrate Okabe Tosa-no-kami had concerns that since Lord Konoe had already received the imperial decree for nairan (preliminary review), arresting Umeda, who frequented his residence, might provoke the indignation of the nobility. So he discussed postponing the arrest with Wakasa-no-kami, who showed considerable hesitation. Hearing this, Nagano, while in Ōtsu, engaged in heated argument with Sakai's advisor Miura Shichibei, who had come to meet him, ultimately declaring that if the Kyoto Deputy was being lenient, he would arrest Umeda even using Hikone troops.

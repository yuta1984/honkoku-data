However, ultimately based on an inquiry from the Nagasaki magistrate, the shogunate ordered that they should first admonish them, and if they still pressed their requests, then accept their state letter. So the Nagasaki magistrate finally permitted the Russian envoys to land on August 19th and proceeded with the ceremony of exchanging documents. The main points of their letter were: first, to establish the national borders between the two countries, and second, to open one or two ports in our country for Russia's sake to permit trade, and also to supply Russian ships with food and other necessary supplies.

However, on October 8th the shogunate appointed two men - Resident Deputy Tsutsui Hizen-no-kami and Finance Magistrate Kawaji Saemon-no-jo - and had them accompanied by Arao Tosa-no-kami and Koga Kin'ichiro, dispatching them to Nagasaki to deliver a reply. The main points were: regarding borders, it goes without saying that these are matters requiring considerable investigation, so they cannot possibly be decided overnight. As for opening ports for trade, while this has been strictly forbidden by ancestral law, recently America has also made such requests, and considering the state of world affairs, we cannot simply adhere to old precedents alone. However, to carry this out would naturally require thorough investigation of the advantages and disadvantages, and moreover, since the matter is so important, it must be reported to the Imperial Court and the opinions of the various lords must be reconciled, so they should wait four or five years for national opinion to be settled.

From this we can see that although only a few months had passed since the American ships' arrival, the shogunate had already recognized the inevitability of opening ports, but there were considerations about the direction of national opinion that made them hesitant to carry this out immediately. This Hizen-no-kami was quite familiar with foreign affairs and recognized the inevitability of opening the country, and Saemon-no-jo also understood that reckless warfare would certainly not benefit the nation. Particularly, someone like Koga Kin'ichiro had been an advocate of opening the country since his father Doan's time, so this mission to Nagasaki appears to have resulted from the shogunate council recognizing the inevitability of opening the country.

However, the Russian envoy Putyatin repeatedly urged the Nagasaki magistrate, but when things did not go as he wished, he gradually changed his previous attitude and became quite aggressive. On October 22nd, despite the Nagasaki magistrate's various attempts at consolation,

he suddenly left Nagasaki with the four ships under his command, entrusting a copy of a letter addressed to the Senior Councilors. Regarding this withdrawal, Putyatin gave various pretexts to the Nagasaki magistrate at the time, but observing from today's perspective, it was precisely when relations between Russia and Britain and France were about to be severed, and having received this information, Putyatin could no longer remain in our country and temporarily withdrew to Shanghai.

However, the Nagasaki magistrate naturally had no way of knowing these circumstances and immediately reported the entire affair to the shogunate. At that time, Tsutsui Hizen-no-kami's party was already en route westward, but since the shogunate anticipated the Russian envoy's return, they had the party continue westward, and they reached Saga in early December.

However, on the 5th of the same month, the Russian ships indeed entered Nagasaki port again, so Saemon-no-jo and others hurried from Saga to Nagasaki, and finally on December 14th held their first meeting with Putyatin. Negotiations continued over several sessions, but it was natural that they could not easily reach agreement. Particularly regarding the border issue, Russia insisted that Etorofu Island was entirely their territory and claimed that most of Karafuto (Sakhalin) was also their territory. However, both Hizen-no-kami and Saemon-no-jo, as well as Finance Group Leader Nakamura Tameya (Dewa-no-kami Tokimaro) and others, earnestly protested, arguing that Etorofu Island was clearly entirely our country's territory, and that at least the area south of 50 degrees north latitude of Karafuto must belong to us. It was decided that further negotiations would be conducted after field surveys. Regarding the opening of ports, they ultimately made a promise that since Japan most desired to be close to Russia, if trade were permitted with other countries, it would first be granted to Russia, and as a neighboring country, Russia should be given special favorable treatment. This matter was temporarily settled, but during these negotiations Kaei 6 passed and they welcomed the following spring. Putyatin left Nagasaki on January 8th of Kaei 7.

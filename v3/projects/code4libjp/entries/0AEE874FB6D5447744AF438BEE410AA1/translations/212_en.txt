However, from sunrise to sunset.

1. Regarding book transmission, each school has its own traditions regarding speed, which cannot be uniform. Also, depending on the individual's nature and training progress, it may be difficult to set time limits. However, it has been heard that some, despite having immature skills in their art, desire books, or masters promote them quickly for advancement. Since book transmission should follow the regulations established by the founding masters of each school, the masters shall write detailed explanations and submit them to the inspectors.

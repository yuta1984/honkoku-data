She was buried at Hōzō-ji Temple in Nukata District, Mikawa Province. Although there is a theory that this person died on the 17th day of the 10th month, the Kansei Revised Genealogies of Various Houses and other sources adopt the former theory.

Now, regarding the relationship between this Tadatsugu and Toyohashi, namely Yoshida, this was as described in the previous chapters I have recounted in detail. From when Tadatsugu became lord of this area in Eiroku 8 at age thirty-nine until his retirement in Tenshō 16, approximately twenty-four years passed. As you know, Tadatsugu participated in major and minor battles including Mimatagahara and Nagakute, always leading the generals of eastern Mikawa. At that time, by Ieyasu's command, he served as the standard-bearer of eastern Mikawa, so all orders to the generals of eastern Mikawa had to come through Tadatsugu. For this reason, Yoshida as an urban center naturally became the center of eastern Mikawa and gradually developed. As I briefly mentioned before, Satomura Jōha's travelogue and such materials are quite valuable references. From the circumstances when Nobunaga stayed there, or the situation when Ieyasu's wife from the Toyotomi house entered the castle, we can infer that the castle complex at that time must have been of considerable scale. After entering the castle, Tadatsugu organized Yoshida's urban streets, and the bridge over the Toyo River was first built by Tadatsugu from the area of present-day Sekiya to the opposite bank, though it was an earthen bridge at that time, as I mentioned in the previous chapter.

Among Tadatsugu's documents remaining in the Toyohashi vicinity, there is a prohibition notice dated the 5th day of the 7th month of Eiroku 8 at Higashi Kannon-ji Temple in Komatsubara, Atsumi District, and a prohibition notice dated the 25th day of the 6th month of Tenshō 13 at Fumon-ji Temple in Kunotani. Both have his personal seal, and the form of the characters appears somehow prudent yet with flowing elements, seeming to reveal something of his personality. Of course, regarding Tadatsugu's career, you should be familiar with it from the stories I have gradually recounted, but this person originally possessed both wisdom and courage, and I think certain aspects of his methods greatly resembled Ieyasu's. Perhaps many of Ieyasu's actions during his youth actually originated from Tadatsugu's strategies, and particularly Tadatsugu always accompanied Ie-

...yasu in every battle. When Ieyasu wanted to advance, Tadatsugu would restrain him; when Tadatsugu wanted to advance, Ieyasu would restrain him. In this way, they mutually cautioned against rash actions and repeatedly exercised caution upon caution. Indeed, the Tokugawa style of taking great care upon great care and not rushing forward - this method can truly be seen in Tadatsugu's character. However, Tadatsugu was certainly not a person of timid deliberation. When he anticipated that the time was ripe, or when circumstances left no choice, he displayed what could be called a brave and vigorous attitude, truly demonstrating his military prowess. Of course, from middle age onward, Ieyasu learned considerably from Kōshū military strategy and gradually accumulated the merits of experience, so he often made his own plans and judgments. But regarding earlier matters, I think Tadatsugu's influence was quite significant. Although Ieyasu had many other wise and brave generals and retainers besides Tadatsugu, and their contributions were certainly not small, whenever I think about why the Tokugawa came late to rule the realm and yet maintained it for so long, I believe that while this was certainly the result of generations of Tokugawa self-cultivation, it also greatly originated from the support of Tadatsugu and others during Ieyasu's youth. Therefore, in studying Ieyasu, I think research into this Tadatsugu must be among the most important matters that cannot be neglected. However, it is truly regrettable that aside from one or two items, there are no concrete remains of Tadatsugu's works in this area, making it impossible to know the details.

Now regarding Ietsugu, Ietsugu was initially called Kogorō and was Tadatsugu's eldest son. His mother was Kōju-fujin, and he was born in Eiroku 7. At the Battle of Nagakute in Tenshō 3, at age twelve he accompanied his father to battle. In the 10th month of the same 16th year, he succeeded his father and became lord of this Yoshida castle, and on the 29th day of the 11th month of the 17th year he was appointed to the court rank of Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, and the title of Kunai-no-taiyu. However, in the following 18th year, the well-known Odawara campaign began, so I think it is necessary to discuss that matter somewhat here.

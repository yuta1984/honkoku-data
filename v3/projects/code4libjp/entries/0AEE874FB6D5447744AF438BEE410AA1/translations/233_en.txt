There was a domain samurai named Hozumi Seishichirō, who was truly a great promoter of Western learning in our Yoshida domain and should be greatly remembered, so I would like to open the discussion about this person here.

Seishichirō's father was also a Yoshida domain samurai named Hozumi Kizaemon, and Seishichirō was his eldest son. He was born in the first month of Tenpō 7 at the domain residence in Edo, and later took the name Seiken. His father Kizaemon was the chief retainer and became a close vassal to domain lord Nobuhisa, specializing in martial arts such as archery, horsemanship, spear fighting, and swordsmanship, with a stipend of 170 koku.

The Uraga magistrate's assistant Nakajima Saburōsuke, whom I briefly mentioned earlier, was Kizaemon's younger brother, making him Seishichirō's uncle. This Saburōsuke became famous when Perry first arrived at Uraga in Kaei 6, as he visited the ships and conducted the first dialogue with the Americans. In Ansei 2, when the shogunate sent selected students to Nagasaki as naval cadets, Saburōsuke was chosen along with Katsu Rintarō and others to go to Nagasaki. During his naval training, he studied alongside Fukutani Keikichi, whom I mentioned earlier. As you know, at the end of the Edo period when Enomoto Kamejirō fled to Hakodate and holed up in Goryōkaku, Saburōsuke joined his cause. Although Enomoto and others eventually surrendered, Saburōsuke alone held his ground, defending the battery at Chiyogaoka, and died in battle along with his two sons.

Having such a person as his uncle, Seishichirō had long been told of the necessity of studying Western learning. At age twenty, in Ansei 2 - coincidentally the year the shogunate established the Institute for the Investigation of Barbarian Books - Seishichirō was encouraged by Saburōsuke to finally undertake the study of Dutch learning. However, at that time he still could not neglect martial arts training, so he sought a Dutch learning teacher in a convenient location. It happened that a Dutch physician named Tsuboi Nobumichi had opened his practice outside Gofukubashi and taught Western learning alongside his medical practice, so Seishichirō initially began attending his school. At that time, Seishichirō's residence was in the domain's middle compound at Kitashinbori, so from there he would go daily to Tsuboi's place to study arduously for nearly two years while also practicing martial arts,

but he only managed to master one volume of Dutch grammar.

However, this was naturally a time when anti-foreign sentiment was strong, so Dutch learning faced rejection even among colleagues. Once, someone from his domain wrote graffiti on the cover of his hidden Dutch grammar book. Looking back now, that graffiti is quite interesting - it read "You can eat dumplings, but you can't eat Dutch language." This shows part of the mindset of young people at that time.

Given such circumstances, Seishichirō realized that to properly study Dutch learning required complete dedication - it would be unreliable to attend classes in his spare time from official duties while practicing martial arts. He finally petitioned his domain lord for leave, abandoned martial arts, and entered the school of Murata Kuraoku, who had opened a private academy on Kudanzaka. As you know, this Murata Kuraoku was the person later known as Ōmura Masujirō, who has a great bronze statue erected on Kudan slope. Seishichirō devoted himself to Dutch learning there, and later transferred to a school in Banchō run by Takahata Gorō (later called Bizan), a samurai from Awa domain.

However, at that time imported Dutch books were extremely scarce, so most had to be hand-copied. The main subjects were astronomy, geography, physics, military science, and medicine, and the research involved tremendous hardship and effort. Fortunately, the books Seishichirō used during that time have been preserved and were donated to our city several years ago by his younger brother Hozumi Torakurō, so I am pleased that they will be permanently preserved in the city library.

A memorial that Seishichirō submitted to his domain in Ansei 3, when he was twenty-one, also remains today. I believe this serves as valuable reference material, so I would like to present the full text below:

"Regarding coastal defense in recent years, with all due reverence, the authorities have been taking great care in this matter, and although our domain house has been thoroughly prepared since the time of the former lord, given the current circumstances, there is even more need for attention. Although it is most presumptuous for inexperienced persons such as ourselves to speak on such detailed matters..."

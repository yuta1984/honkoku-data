...various details about plotting rebellion were recorded and sent to Gifu, and Nobunaga was surprised. He immediately sent a messenger to Hamamatsu to summon Sakai Saemon-no-jō and Ōkubo Shichirō-uemon, and regarding the Third Lord, secretly Sakai and all the family elders had given advice numerous times, but he would not heed it. At that time both Sakai and Ōkubo were on bad terms with the Third Lord, so Nobunaga became angry, saying "How can such an evil person inherit Ieyasu's house? In the future he will surely become a great threat to the family." The two retainers made their statements here, and if they had made any defense, it would not have come to such a grave matter, but having long been on bad terms with the Third Lord, both were exasperated and said "Indeed as you say, he is a treacherous person. Your resentment is entirely justified." Ieyasu too became angry and declared "Such a person should commit suicide," and on the first day of the eighth month of Tenshō 7 this was reported to Nobunaga. Nobunaga too had been secretly angry about this matter, so he replied "Do as you see fit." On the fifth day of the eighth month Ieyasu went to Okazaki, sent the Third Lord to Ōhama, and moved Honda Sakuzaemon to Okazaki. The Third Lord thought this was temporary displeasure, but Ieyasu was at Nishio Castle. However, the Third Lord was moved to Horie in Enshū, and on the fifteenth day of the ninth month of the same year he was made to commit suicide at Futamata in Enshū. His mother Lady Tsukiyama also committed suicide for her long-standing evil deeds.

Looking at this, it does not appear that Tadatsugu served as a messenger for the Oda clan. Most likely at this time Tadatsugu happened to go to Azuchi on Ieyasu's business, but Nobunaga summoned him and secretly questioned him about the twelve-article letter, according to one theory. Various other speculative theories about this matter are still handed down, but I think there is no need to mention them all here. However, from any perspective, it appears that depending on how Tadayoshi and Tadatsugu had handled things at that time, Nobuyasu need not have died. Also, it is said that Ieyasu, though he had no choice but to let Nobuyasu die at that time, felt great regret about it. Regarding this, I will mention two or three stories. First, a man called Nonaka Sangorō Shigemasa was ordered to kill Lady Sekiguchi, and when he reported back to Ieyasu, Ieyasu said "Since it concerned a woman, though I ordered her killed, surely there was some way to handle it through an intermediary.

Yet you were so thoughtless as to actually kill her?" Shigemasa was truly mortified and thereafter went into seclusion, as recorded in his family traditions. Also, when Nobuyasu's tutor Hiraiwa Chikayoshi heard that Nobuyasu had been found guilty, he was greatly shocked and immediately met with Ieyasu, saying "If Nobuyasu committed misconduct, then as his tutor I am responsible, so please cut off my head and apologize to Nobunaga." At that time Ieyasu said: "I do not believe that Nobuyasu would side with Takeda in rebellion, but in this time of civil war, caught between powerful enemies, I depend solely on Nobunaga for support. If I now lose that backing, our domain would perish before tomorrow comes. To destroy the hereditary domain for the sake of father-son affection that cannot be abandoned shows one who knows how to love a child but does not think of ancestors. Without this consideration, to lose an innocent child and selfishly cling to a heartless life would be unbearable. Even if I cut off your head now, I do not think that would save Nobuyasu, so killing you now would be uselessly causing the death of one loyal retainer." He is said to have shed tears as he spoke.

Furthermore, that Nobuyasu was finally moved to Futamata and entrusted to Tadayoshi had deep meaning, but Tadayoshi never understood that meaning. Later when watching a Kōwaka dance performance, at the part where Mitsunaka orders his retainer Nakamitsu to kill his son Mimemaru, but Nakamitsu instead kills his own son as a substitute, Ieyasu turned to Tadayoshi and said "Watch this dance very carefully," and Tadayoshi was greatly terrified, it is said. In any case, regarding this matter, the actions of Tadatsugu and Tadayoshi are quite questionable, so I think there is room for research. In connection with this, what I want to mention here is the matter of the monk Hakushū Genryū.

The monk Genryū was a resident monk of that Ryūnenji Temple mentioned in detail in the previous chapter, and counting from the temple's founder Kyūya Sōkan, he was the fourth generation. This person was a so-called renowned monk and scholar, later receiving the imperial title Hōki Enmei Zenji. Among the thirty-six generations of Ryūnenji abbots, he was the only one to receive an imperial title. When this person was serving as head priest of Ryūnenji was precisely when Tada-

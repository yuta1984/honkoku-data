Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Matsudaira Nobuyori's Succession) 390

**Main Text:**
...was learned, and particularly his calligraphy could be called quite skilled, with many examples remaining in our Toyohashi region.

Now, I briefly mentioned Nakayama Biseki before. This man was originally born in Yoshida on October 10, An'ei 4, and died in the eighth month of Tenpō 14 at the age of fifty-nine. As I mentioned before, he was a disciple of Motoori Ōhira and wrote works such as "Gosenshū Shinshō" (New Excerpts from the Later Collection). The publication of this "Gosenshū Shinshō" seems to have caused him extraordinary hardship, particularly regarding expenses. Initially he borrowed part of the funds from the domain lord, but his struggles to repay this loan are evident in the "Court Records," evoking sympathy even today.

Looking at the chronology of the venerable Motoori Ōhira, we find that this Biseki wrote the preface, and in the disciple register he is listed first among the people of Yoshida. Since the names listed in this disciple register show what kinds of people studied national learning under Ōhira at the time, it is quite interesting, so I would like to excerpt only those who were residents of Yoshida:

**Mikawa Province, Yoshida**
**Disciples of Motoori Ōhira**
Nakayama Yasuke Biseki, Jissōin Kodō, Hashimoto Shūsaku Yōsei
Nishioka Ginsuke Masayuki, Nakayama Koemon Shindō, Koike Ichian Kyō
Kuno Itsuzō Tamekuni, Tomida Tomiji Ashiho, Ogawa Shūzō Chifumi

Hadano Hitachi Takao, Nakagawa family daughter Tamae

Among these names, some people's careers are known today while others remain unclear, but the "Lord Matsudaira" mentioned is undoubtedly Nobuyori. This is because at the end of Ōhira's "Uchitō" disciple register, under "deceased father's disciples with continuing correspondence," it records "Lord Matsudaira Izunokami Nobuyori, his concubine Machiko, and his lady-in-waiting Tamae." From this we can believe that Nobuyori also became Ōhira's disciple through Biseki's introduction and maintained continuous correspondence with the Motoori family.

I would also like to mention that five people from Yoshida became disciples of the famous Motoori Norinaga, Ōhira's grandfather, and are listed in his disciple register. These were: Suzuki Tosa (entered Tenmei 4), Suzuki Mutsu (entered Kansei 1), Suzuki Wakasa and Ōyama Jizaemon's mother Nui (entered Kansei 5), and Hōgyōin Kanren (entered Kansei 12). Among these, Suzuki Tosa and Suzuki Mutsu were father and son.

**Suzuki Tosa**
**Suzuki Mutsu**
These are ancestors of the current Suzuki Nobuji. The man called Tosa was named Yanamaro, and his son called Mutsu was named Shigeno. Both were quite remarkable people, but Tosa belonged to Nobuaki's era, so I should have discussed him then, but I mention him here now. This Tosa was truly frugal but also did many good deeds. The correspondence he exchanged with Norinaga still remains in the Nobuji family home, and he left behind quite a few of his own writings. Recently I discovered among his notes a record of the great fire that occurred in Yoshida Honmachi in the eleventh month of An'ei 8, which I find quite interesting.

**Suzuki Tosa's Record of the An'ei 8 Great Fire in Yoshida**
Of course, I briefly mentioned this fire when discussing Nobuaki's era, but I would like to include it here as a supplement.

"On the night of November 3rd at the seventh hour of dawn (November 4th), fire broke out from the residence of Fujii Sōjun in Honmachi. All of Honmachi burned, the Tennō shrine in Mikoshi-yasumi-chō was completely destroyed, the residence of the shrine priest Tanaka Ōmi burned down, then the fire spread to Uomachi, burning from the western part of Uomachi. A strong dry wind was blowing, and the house of a man named Zenkurō west of Gongen..."

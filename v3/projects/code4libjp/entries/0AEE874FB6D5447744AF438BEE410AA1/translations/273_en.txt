...should be dismissed. Also, when Shimazu Hisamitsu later visited the Hitotsubashi residence to take his farewell before departure, with Yoshinaga also present, he made various demands. Among them he stated that the newly appointed Kyoto Deputy Matsudaira Hoki-no-kami seemed to be problematic in terms of public sentiment, so he wished that after further deliberation, imperial will should be consulted regarding personnel selection. In addition to this, he said the same applied to the Osaka Castle Keeper. For this reason, at that time Nobutaka, being the son of Norikatsu, was not well regarded by the loyalist expulsion party. However, regarding the opinion about dismissing Nobutaka, both Yoshinobu and Yoshinaga declined to agree, so thereafter there was no particular incident and Nobutaka continued to serve as Osaka Castle Keeper. But given that he assumed such a crucial position during the turbulent times I have described in previous chapters, I imagine that both Nobutaka and the domain's senior retainers faced considerable difficulties. As chief retainer at that time, the aforementioned Nishimura Jiuemon accompanied him. This man was truly a distinguished minister of his generation, and I believe it could be said that it was fortunate they had him that they were able to fulfill this important responsibility. The well-known Kojima Kanso also accompanied them, having been transferred from his role as chief inspector to repair magistrate. Kanso also became someone Nobutaka relied upon greatly. On June 14th of that year, Bunkyu 2, still a little before taking up the Osaka post, there remains in the same family a document called "Written Acceptance of Secret Orders" submitted to Nobutaka. Careful examination of this reveals the relationship between Nobutaka and Kanso at that time, and I think it also allows us to infer much about the domain's situation. This written acceptance is quite long, but to summarize the main points: it was a document Kanso submitted on May 29th, saying he was truly overcome with emotion upon suddenly receiving Nobutaka's secret instructions. Essentially, Nobutaka's intention was that while hereditary stipends and positions are not necessarily bad, they can also become causes of stagnation between high and low ranks and sources of decline in government and education. Particularly in the current times, thinking of ancestor Minamoto Sanmi's loyal service to the Imperial Court and Izu-no-kami Nobuna's devoted efforts for the shogunate, and wishing to carry on both these lords' intentions and revive their legacy, it would be proper to open paths for selection and promotion, especially to recruit capable and heroic men who lie hidden among the grass and undergrowth...

...and heroes among those talented men whom other domains have overlooked and failed to employ. Of course, among these, merely capable men might end up as nothing more than farmers and rustics if not employed, but the so-called heroic men hidden in the grass and undergrowth, if there is no one to recruit them, could become insurgents and rebels causing disorder. Therefore, recruiting these men and allowing them to find their proper place would not only strengthen one domain's government and military prestige but also serve as a means of preventing disorder throughout the realm. This matter should be secretly planned, and those who bear this responsibility might sometimes serve as advisors morning and evening, sometimes travel far under the pretext of study, always fulfilling secret missions in hidden and obscure ways, accomplishing their subtle loyalty through natural and ambiguous means. This is the main purpose of entrusting this task to Kanso. Kanso initially appeared to decline this responsibility, but as it was a second command from above, he finally accepted it. Consequently, he continued to present his own opinions along with these circumstances in a written memorial. In this there was much discussion about the recruitment of talent, noting that long ago Zhuge Liang emerged to serve after three visits, while Kusunoki Masashige responded to the call after being moved by a single dream. These represent different paths of Japan and China, but essentially the principle of "sacrificing oneself while thinking of one's lord" is the great duty of our country, and similar points were written. Also, retainers can be broadly divided into two types: loyal retainers and strategists. Among these are those who are loyal retainers who also serve as strategists, and strategists who also serve as loyal retainers. A loyal retainer is one who knows only his own lord and knows no other lord, who can share safety and danger, survival and destruction with his lord to the end. However, strategists consider the realm as their home and feudal lords as their friends, so if employed well they will remain, but if not employed well they will leave. For example, Oishi Yoshio was a loyal retainer who also served as a strategist, while the aforementioned Zhuge Liang was a strategist who became a loyal retainer - such things are also written. In essence, from this we can see that at that time Nobutaka was urgently seeking talent and placed deep trust in Kanso. Moreover, Kanso's opinion was also to strive to obtain men who combined the rare qualities of both loyal retainer and strategist, and even if...

Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Nobutoki's Character and Some of His Achievements) 276

**Main Text:**
About fifty-five volumes are preserved, all meticulously recording daily events in his own handwriting every day. Moreover, these continue from Kyōhō through Genbun and Kanpō periods, precisely during Nobutoki's tenure as senior councilor, so if these were investigated in detail, I think there would be much material for research into the so-called Kyōhō administration, namely the government of the eighth shogun Yoshimune.

Also, there is a work compiled by this person called the "Ōkōchi Family Genealogy," which is a comprehensive study based on examination of the transmitted family records. It is divided into main genealogy, branch genealogies, appendices, descendant genealogies, and separate records. Among those currently stored in the Ōkōchi family, the main genealogy (5 volumes), branch genealogies (7 volumes), appendices (9 volumes), descendant genealogies (8 volumes), and separate records (4 volumes) are all in his own handwriting with a preface dated Kyōhō 19. In any case, if this was his spare-time work while serving as senior councilor, one can truly appreciate how diligent he was. In the preface to his family genealogy, he also wrote:

"I have heard that not knowing the good deeds of one's ancestors shows lack of understanding, and knowing but not transmitting them shows lack of benevolence. Though I am not gifted, I am ashamed of this. Therefore, whenever I have a brief respite after meals, I diligently record what I know, accumulating several volumes. The reason I follow common practice and dare not use refined language is that I want the achievements to be factual and easily understood by people. I hope that children and grandchildren will continue to compile and edit these records to praise and honor future generations. This is why I am ashamed of what gentlemen are ashamed of."

This truly shows us Nobutoki's character.

Moreover, looking at the binding of his diaries and genealogies, they are extremely simple. Particularly the diaries, which are just bamboo paper folded in quarters and bound with twisted paper cords, show how Nobutoki was a person who made simplicity and frugality his principle.

Nobutoki also composed poetry and painted, but frankly speaking, he was probably not quite at the level of a master in either. However, his paintings often show fine detail, and his meticulous and caring nature appears on the canvas. Works like the Kannon statue that remains at Jingūji temple in Toyohashi city today are quite well executed and best display his true character. At Ryūnenji temple there is also a Buddhist image on dark blue paper with gold paint that Nobutoki donated. In terms of precision, this is truly not inferior to any other work. The same applies to his waka poetry, and works like the "Kokin-

shū Hiden" (Secret Transmissions of the Kokinshū) is also something he copied himself and remains with the Ōkōchi family today. For these reasons, he was naturally someone with special dedication to learning, and his invitation of the scholar Miura Chikkei occurred after Nobutoki became lord of Hamamatsu Castle, precisely in Kyōhō 18.

The biography of this scholar Chikkei appears in volume 5 of the "Sentetsu Sōdan Kōhen" (Later Collection of Discussions on Former Sages). Regarding this matter, I received considerable guidance from Mr. Tabei Ryūtarō of the Aichi Prefecture History Compilation Section, so I would like to express my gratitude here. This Chikkei's given name was Yoshishitsu, his courtesy name was Shihin, his childhood name was Yoshinori, and his common name was Heitayū. He was from Edo, his father was called Heizaemon, and his great-grandfather Jinzaemon-no-jō Tameshige once served Oda Nobuo.

While still young, Chikkei was spirited and unbending, brilliant and principled, which led him to serve Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu and receive particularly generous favor. In Hōei 2, when Shogun Tsunayoshi visited Yoshiyasu's residence, Chikkei was seventeen years old and lectured on the chapter "The Way is Near" from Mencius before the shogun, receiving great praise. In middle age, he further studied under Ogyū Sorai. Being naturally gifted and outstanding, within a few years he mastered the classical texts, had original insights, and often surprised people with unexpected ideas. He was also skilled in regular script calligraphy and was particularly beloved by Sorai, but he did not wish to make his way in the world as a Confucian scholar, instead considering himself what we would today call a politician.

Therefore, when he was invited by this Matsudaira family, it was not as a Confucian official but as a samurai. He also served as tutor to Nobutoki's heir Nobunao, and later when Nobunao was transferred back to Yoshida, Chikkei also followed. However, he mostly resided in Edo and seems to have rarely come to Yoshida. Consequently, even today there are hardly any examples of this person's calligraphy to be seen in the Toyohashi area.

This person was by nature quite obstinate and full of indignant spirit. When conversation happened to touch on matters of loyalty and righteousness, he would immediately become solemn and shed tears, but conversely, once he encountered someone whose opinions disagreed with his, he would mercilessly denounce them, so he had quite a few opponents.

He died on May 5, Hōreki 6, at the age of 68, and was buried at Renshūji temple in Ichigaya, Edo. His writings include "Shagaku Seisō Kokuji-kai," "Ritsugaku Seisō Kokuji-kai," "Minritsu Yakugi," and "Chikkei Bunshū."

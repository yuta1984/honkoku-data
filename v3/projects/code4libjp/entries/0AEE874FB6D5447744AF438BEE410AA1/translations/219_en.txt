Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Matsudaira Nobuhisa's Succession) 412

**Main Text:**
...entered and succeeded the Ōkōchi clan, receiving its domain. Nobuhisa's childhood name was Risaburō, and he was born on April 23, Bunsei 12. He succeeded to the domain on November 15, Ka'ei 3, at age 22. Since this person continued from then until the Meiji Restoration, he truly encountered all the transformations of the late Edo period - from the complications of foreign relations to the Ansei Purge and the Meiji Restoration. Therefore, when attempting to describe the history of his generation, it is quite complex, so I intend to conveniently change chapters according to the periods to provide explanations. First, I would like to present the official announcement at the time of Nobuhisa's succession:

Ka'ei 3, Year of the Metal Dog, February 15, at Yoshida Castle
Lord Nobuhisa's personal writing, announced to the senior retainers in the great hall: "Regarding this unexpected succession to the family headship, I should inform everyone about political matters, but since the family administration of successive generations has been exceptional and beyond my inexperienced capabilities, I shall not add any personal innovations but shall prudently follow the old systems in all matters and maintain the family traditions. I ask that everyone also devote their full efforts to assist me."

"The previous lord's financial situation was extremely dire, and with no prospect of assistance for the retainers, he ordered exceptional economies, even wearing cotton clothes himself and limiting his meals to a single dish, causing himself deep concern. Yet he passed away before long - though it was his natural lifespan, it was indeed a sorrowful matter. From now on, I shall continue his intentions and practice even greater simplicity and frugality, hoping to quickly restore our finances and relieve everyone's hardships, but this is not easily accomplished. Truly, superiors and subordinates must work together - those above should show compassion to those below, those below should assist those above, and all should work in harmony with sincere dedication."

"The cultivation of literary and military arts is the primary duty of samurai, so one must always be mindful of this. Young men especially should encourage their aspirations and strive diligently without laziness. Learning should be applied to one's daily conduct. In all matters, benevolence and righteousness are indispensable."

Now, regarding the national situation at the time of Nobuhisa's succession, around Ka'ei 2-3, as I mentioned before, foreign ships were frequently arriving at our coasts and public opinion was gradually reaching a boiling point. The senior councillor Abe Ise-no-kami Masahiro specifically called upon Lord Nariaki of Mito for consultation and devised strategies to strengthen coastal defenses. However, at that time, the finances of both the shogunate and the various domains were in severe straits, causing difficulties for all. Even in Yoshida domain, on February 25, Ka'ei 3, Nobuhisa directly issued the following announcement to his retainers:

"Regarding coastal defense when foreign ships arrive, serious orders have been issued this time. Should ships arrive, we must immediately dispatch troops upon receiving notice, so we must prepare in advance for deployment. Since there may be those with years of rice debts and inadequate equipment, I would like to provide generous assistance, but given the current circumstances, though it goes against my wishes, I can only provide minimal aid. Though it will be difficult, please make do as best you can, prepare your equipment somehow, and upon receiving notice, quickly assemble, unite, and devote all your strength to defense measures."

From this, one can understand something of the circumstances of that time. Subsequently, foreign ship arrivals became increasingly frequent, and on June 3, Ka'ei 6, as you know, the American envoy Perry finally arrived at Uraga, and the Tokugawa shogunate's isolationist policy thus began to show the first signs of collapse.

Now, regarding this foreign relations issue, I have been discussing it gradually, but it is quite a complex matter, and the more one researches it, the more new facts are discovered. Therefore, I cannot possibly fully discuss all its implications within the scope of today's Toyohashi city history, but I must at least briefly outline the general course of events here, or there will be circumstances that hinder explaining Nobuhisa's generation. So I shall trace back somewhat to the beginning and summarize its origins...

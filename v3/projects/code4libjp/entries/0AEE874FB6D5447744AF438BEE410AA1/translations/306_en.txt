If the bakufu were to completely

follow Imperial intentions with determination and strive for expelling foreigners, then Imperial intentions would naturally be communicated through, and naturally

Court-bakufu unity would be achieved without needing to mention it. In that case, matters such as marriage alliance would be fine either way. However, without any regard for these preceding and following procedures, solely

using the Imperial sister's marriage alliance (I understand that the Imperial sister had already been promised to someone from the palace faction, but was forcibly separated and newly betrothed to the Kantō - this makes it even more problematic) to achieve Court-bakufu unity, and then accomplish the merit of determined foreign expulsion - such was the plan. Officially, the senior councilors jointly signed a statement saying they would necessarily raise punitive forces within ten years, but what their true intentions were is difficult to fathom. Moreover, the Kyoto deputy reportedly used massive bribes of gold and silver to win over court nobles, and particularly

even engaged in secret consultations with the attending physicians - such serious false rumors arose to the extent that various internal and external methods were exhausted to achieve success, which sounded somewhat like forcible seizure or unreasonable appropriation, and this too, I believe, became part of the inflammatory situation mentioned earlier.

Generally, even in marriage alliances between common men and women, agreements are naturally made after mutual harmony between both parties, or sometimes marriage alliances are arranged to establish harmony when there is discord. In such cases, one must first investigate the root of that discord, clarify the reasoning, communicate the intentions, achieve mutual harmony between both parties, and then have marriage alliances to solidify that harmony. If this is not done - if one desires marriage alliance first without resolving the root of discord, hoping thereby to achieve harmony - no one would consent to this. Even if consent were given and marriage alliance achieved, it would ultimately be useless for achieving harmony. This is natural human sentiment, without necessarily any distinction of social status. Therefore, fearfully, in this case

regarding the bakufu's

intention for Court-bakufu unity, while it is indeed important, they should first properly conduct the great ceremony of revering the Emperor and expelling foreigners, after which Court-bakufu unity and marriage alliance matters would naturally be arranged accordingly. Instead, solely seeking to establish unity first with subsequent plans as mentioned above

even if such proposals were made, given the previous dilatory behavior, how would they be received in the capital? Surely such matters would be considered extremely unreliable and superficial, but nevertheless, if strongly proposed on the grounds of serving the nation, they would temporarily entrust matters to Kantō's judgment. However, in reality

Imperial intentions have naturally not yet been communicated through

Though nominally Court-bakufu unity, in reality it can hardly be called harmonious consolidation. Meanwhile, the foreign barbarians have for years exercised authority and deception against our country, but

the bakufu's handling of these matters has been particularly dilatory and expedient, meekly accepting their insults, gradually imitating the barbarians' sorcerous methods, and variously

making unreasonable demands to the Imperial Court, achieving their wishes through authority and deception in unreasonable petitions - treating the barbarians as friends while

showing contempt for the Imperial Court. The samurai and people of the great outside domains would speak of this without reserve or concern (since the beginning of this reign, literary education has greatly flourished and ethics have been clarified, so that even three-foot children speak of revering the sovereignty of our ten-thousand-chariot Emperor - this is completely different from the Hōjō and Ashikaga periods). Fearfully, these matters too

resulted entirely from the bakufu's contradictory policies, causing inflammatory reactions.

Now, even within what we call the righteous arguments and loyal indignation of those concerned for the country, there are naturally great differences between inside and outside domains. In any case, the Three Branch Houses and hereditary houses, first and foremost for the sake of the realm

cherish the Tokugawa lineage, so they earnestly petition the bakufu about everything, and

even when the bakufu does not heed them

they do not act for the nation's sake while bypassing the bakufu (even when the late Lord of Mito made various appeals to Kyoto in previous years, his ultimate intention was, I believe, to borrow Imperial authority to make the bakufu more aware). Regardless of taboos, avoiding no suspicion, sacrificing self and domain to engage in troublesome disputes to the utmost - yet when brothers quarrel within the household, outsiders will scorn

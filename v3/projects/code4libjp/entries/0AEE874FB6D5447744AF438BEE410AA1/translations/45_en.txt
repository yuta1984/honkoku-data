...remembering how he had stayed there in the past, and being guided to Iwase Shikibu's residence. Soon the welcoming party from Ushikubo arrived, and saying "well then, from here on," they sent back the people of Nishi-no-kori. Then Makino Heishiro and others came to welcome them, and Denzaburo was waiting at the temple in Toyokawa.

The head priest also came out to receive them, with cups offered repeatedly - the treatment by the distinguished guests was excessive. When they tried to leave halfway through the drinking, various things were brought for the journey. Heishiro, Heizaburo and others of the same name, sent them as far as Tominaga. Oribe Nyudo and his sons, Imaizumi Yashiro and others had already gathered and were waiting. Since last year, conflicts had arisen between the mountain houses and the central provinces, making this road completely impassable, but enemies and allies escorted each other, meeting and parting. This was the area I had seen when making a pilgrimage to Horaiji Temple long ago. Oribe's new castle was quite surprising to see. Years had passed, and his eldest son Shinshichiro and many other children all appeared to be of good character. Though it was just a traveler's lodging with no special preparations, they had our humble traveling gear brought to the sukiya parlor. Soon we had baths and dinner, cuisine with the sound of wild geese, and famous sake from distant Bishu province - quite remarkable for a time when the roads were impassable.

Among these, "Totaro" refers to Udono, the lord of Nishi-no-kori castle, while "Makino Denzaburo" I believe was a person called Narimoto, son of Makino Dewa-no-kami Yasunari. It appears that at this time, Yasunari held power in Ushikubo.

Heishiro and Heizaburo were naturally members of his clan, with Heizaburo being someone who lived in Ina. The Socho memoir also mentions "Makino Heizaburo of Ina," and I believe this refers to the same person. "Oribe Nyudo" refers to Suganuma Oribe-no-sho Sadanori, whose son was Sadamura and whose grandson was the famous Sadamitsu, who later defended Noda castle against Takeda Shingen.

The passage mentioning "Oribe's new castle was surprising" raises some questions about which location this refers to, but I believe it corresponds to present-day Shinshiro town. At that time, Oribe-no-sho's main castle was at Noda, but around that period he built a new fortress in the area of present-day Shinshiro town, which may have been called "Shinjo" (new castle).

The text mentions being "sent as far as Tominaga," and this place, now written as "Tominaga," is within Iwakura village and borders Shinshiro town. Someone once claimed that this "Shinjo" referred to Noda castle, not present-day Shinshiro town, and that the castle in present-day Shinshiro was built even later.

However, regarding this place called Shinjo, there have been various theories since ancient times. Documents like the "Shinshiro Memoir" describe this castle as having been built during the Tenbun era by Suganuma Taizen-no-suke Sadatsugu, lord of Oya castle in Hirai village. This castle underwent many changes and at times fell into ruin, making it quite difficult to obtain clear evidence.

However, regarding the "Shinjo" mentioned in this Eastern Journey Record, I recently consulted Yoshida Togo's geographical dictionary and found the same opinion as my previously stated theory. This seems to support that theory.

Now, the Koji era followed Tenbun. In Koji 2, Matsudaira Takechiyo, who was with the Imagawa family, came of age at fifteen on the 15th day of the first month, receiving a portion of Yoshimoto's name and being given the name Motonobu. There is also a theory placing this in the 3rd month of Koji 1, but as this is not essential, I will not elaborate. In the following third year, he changed his name again to Motoyasu, and as you all know, this person later became Tokugawa Ieyasu.

The following year, the era name changed again to Eiroku. Ieyasu was seventeen that year when he marched to western Mikawa. His first battle was actually in the 2nd month of Koji 2, attacking the castle of Nanouchi in Nukata District, but from then on he participated in many battles. The famous provisioning of Odaka castle and similar operations occurred around this time. During the Battle of Okehazama in Eiroku 3 (362 years ago), he naturally joined the Imagawa army, first capturing Marune castle and entering Odaka castle to replace Udono Nagasuke on the very day of the Okehazama battle, the 19th day of the 5th month.

Originally, this Odaka castle was located on a small hill south of present-day Odaka Station. At that time, seawater reached deep inland near Narumi, and the castle protruded into enemy territory, making it quite difficult to defend.

Yoshimoto departed Sunpu on the 10th day of the 5th month, camped at this Yoshida on the 14th, gradually advanced, and on the 19th took position at a place called Dengaku-hazama near Okehazama. On this day, he was attacked and killed by Oda Nobunaga, as is widely known. The event was so sudden that the Imagawa forces were thrown into great confusion, with even the commander of Okazaki abandoning his castle...

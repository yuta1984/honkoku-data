Tenmei 8, 3rd month, 5th day
To Matsudaira Izu-no-kami

Now the topic changes again to the great fire that occurred in Yoshida on the 4th day of the 11th month of An'ei 8 (1779). The fire started from Honmachi and consumed 384 townhouses and one district of samurai residences. This happened just when Nobuaki had first entered his domain and was residing in the castle.

**Fire Brigade Organization:** I would also like to discuss the fire brigade organization of Yoshida town. In Tenmei 7 (1787), four brigades were established in the town, with eleven men per brigade. All equipment appears to have been provided by the domain. Fortunately, a document submitted by brigade members at that time remains in Funamachi, which I find quite interesting, so I will present the complete text here as well.

**Pledge Document Submitted**

This time, four town fire brigades have been appointed with eleven men each per brigade. Hatanaka Gensuke has been appointed as head of one brigade. As per the joint signature list, we shall serve as town firefighters.

1. When a fire occurs, we shall rush immediately and work diligently to extinguish it. If the fire proves difficult to control, we shall work at the fire site under orders from the castle officials and town officials. The brigades shall coordinate without scattering and work together. The firefighting signboards and various tools listed below have been distributed and are kept with the brigade leader. They shall never be used for private purposes.

1 set of happi coats: 11
1 set of work pants: 11  
1 set of matori lanterns: 1

We have certainly received the above items. When fires occur, if candles and other supplies are needed, we shall receive them from the monthly duty officials through written requests. If any tools are lost at fire scenes, we shall report this immediately. If items are lost through private negligence, the fire brigade shall promptly replace them.

1. Even if illness, obstacles, or distant travel affect any of the eleven brigade members, we shall always be vigilant and have substitute personnel ready so that fire response is not hindered.

1. We understand and humbly accept that firefighting equipment will be subject to periodic inspections.

1. Regarding rice stipends for this service:
The authorities provide two rice bags per brigade annually. The brigade leader receives 1 to 2 shō of rice, with the remaining rice distributed among the ten members as ordered. We are grateful for this arrangement. We understand that rewards will be given based on performance observed during firefighting efforts. Therefore, we submit this joint pledge document.

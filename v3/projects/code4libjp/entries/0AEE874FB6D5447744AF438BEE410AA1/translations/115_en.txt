**Toyohashi City Historical Discourse** (The Transfer of Matsudaira Tadatoshi) 204

Ōi-no-suke Yoshikage died on June 9th of Eiroku 4 (1561), and his eldest son, Ōi-no-suke Yoshikage, succeeded him. As already mentioned in the previous chapter, this person also had great military achievements for the Tokugawa clan. However, in the 4th month of Eiroku 4 (1561), at the age of 44, he died in battle against Kira Yoshiaki at the embankment of Zenmyōji in Hazu District. His son was Tonomo-no-suke Koretada, who was also a great warrior. In the 7th year of Eiroku (1564), during the Battle of Yoshida, he is recorded as having defended the fort at Kikenji together with Udono Hachirō Saburō Nagateru. He also died in battle at the Battle of Nagakute while attacking the fort at Tobino-su together with Sakai Tadatsugu, all of which I believe you are already well aware of.

Tonomo-no-suke Ietada: At this time, Koretada was 39 years old, and his son was the famous Ietada. This person also achieved countless feats and accomplishments for the Tokugawa clan, and as mentioned in the previous chapter, he died heroically in battle at Fushimi Castle on August 1st of Keichō 5 (1600) together with Torii Mototada and others. {Three generations of fathers and ancestors died consecutively for their lord} That both father and grandfather died in service to the same lord family is quite remarkable, even for the warring states period. Tadatoshi was still called Hachirō at the time, and when his father Ietada died in battle, he was in Kantō guarding Omigawa Castle in Shimōsa Province. After the Battle of Sekigahara ended, in the 2nd month of Keichō 6 (1601), he was again granted Fukōzu in this province, the hereditary domain of his forefathers, and ruled 10,000 koku. In the summer of the 9th year, he was appointed and took the title Tonomo-no-suke, and this time succeeded the Takenotani Matsudaira clan, finally becoming the lord of Yoshida Castle.

The Bell Inscription Incident: Such was the situation, but in the 19th year, the famous bell inscription incident occurred between Sunpu and Osaka. As you know, regarding the Great Buddha Hall in Kyoto that was destroyed in the great earthquake of July in the 1st year of Keichō (1596), Ieyasu recommended to Hideyori and his mother that they rebuild it, saying that since it was Toyotaikō's cherished wish, they should continue his will and help his soul find peace. Hideyori and his mother were greatly pleased and began construction in the 11th month of Keichō 7 (1602), but there were problems along the way and work was temporarily suspended. However, they resumed construction and it was finally completed in the spring of the 17th year. In the 3rd month of the 19th year, they decided to cast the bell, which was soon completed, and when they were about to hold the completion ceremony, the bell inscription contained the characters "kokka ankō" (national peace)

These characters were seen as inauspicious because they deliberately interrupted the two characters "Ieyasu." Moreover, there were points in the text that could be seen as curses. This sudden objection from Ieyasu became a major incident that ultimately led to the great war known as the Winter Campaign of Osaka. Originally, since the Battle of Sekigahara, as mentioned before, there seemed to be a particular barrier between Kantō and Osaka. While on the surface they appeared close through marriage alliances, it was never truly pleasant. From Kantō's perspective, the Toyotomi clan was truly a thorn in their side, and as long as they existed, they could never rest easy. There was undoubtedly a constant desire to remove them if the opportunity arose. Moreover, as Ieyasu grew older, he naturally seemed to become more urgent about matters. There were also great strategists like Honda Masanobu who devised various desperate measures. In contrast, on the Osaka side, their leader Yodogimi, being a woman, had shallow judgment.

Winter Campaign of Osaka: Not only that, but there was also a lack of harmony among her retainers, and they even dismissed loyal men like Katagiri Katsumoto. That such a trivial matter became the catalyst for opening hostilities is truly pitiful for the Toyotomi clan. While a detailed account of the Osaka campaigns would require considerable time, I think it unnecessary here, so I intend to keep it as brief as possible. Ultimately, Ieyasu decided to march on Osaka and departed Sunpu {Ieyasu's expedition to Osaka, stopping at Yoshida} on October 11th of that year, arriving at Yoshida on the 15th. At this time, Tadatoshi, the lord of Yoshida Castle, participated in this campaign. At that time, the castles along the Tōkaidō were provided with garrison troops in addition to their regular castle soldiers for defense. However, it appears that Yoshida Castle was deemed not to require this. This is evident from the "Kansei Chōshū Shoka-fu" (Genealogies of Various Houses Revised in Kansei) in Tadatoshi's biography:

"In this campaign, guards were assigned to castles at various places along the Tōkaidō. Toda Tosa-no-kami Takanao was ordered to guard Okazaki Castle, and reinforcements were to be placed at both Hamamatsu and Yoshida castles. The retainer Matsudaira Kageyū Saemon Yasusada was summoned to Okazaki, and [Ieyasu] asked Tadatoshi whom he would leave behind to guard [the castle]."

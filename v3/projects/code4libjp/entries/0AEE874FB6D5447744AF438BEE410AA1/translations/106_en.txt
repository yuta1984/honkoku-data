to advise him to do so. However, the responses of both Kagekatsu and Kanetsugu were far from being humble apologies; rather, they deliberately used arrogant and mocking language, which further enraged Ieyasu. Of course, Ieyasu had known from the beginning that this would happen, and even before his envoys to Aizu had returned with their reports, he was already preparing for military action. Upon receiving the aforementioned reply, he immediately announced his expedition to Aizu, though various magistrates and the three senior councilors advised against it, Ieyasu ultimately would not listen to them.

On the 16th day of the 6th month of that year, he had his retainer Sano Tsunamasa guard the western castle with only about 500 men, and finally departed Osaka himself with over 3,000 officers and men under his command, setting out on the eastward journey. At this time, as you know, Sakai Ietsugu, Toda Kazuaki and his son Ujitetsu also accompanied him. On this day at dusk, they arrived at Fushimi Castle, where Ieyasu appointed the castle's caretakers, making Torii Mototada the commander and assigning Naitō Ienaga and his son Motonaga, Matsudaira Ietada, and Matsudaira Chikamasa as his assistants for this duty.

Among these, Matsudaira Ietada was the author of the famous Ietada Diary that has frequently come up in our discussions, the former lord of Fukōzu Castle, who at that time was the lord of Oshi Castle in Musashi, as I mentioned in the previous chapter. This Torii Mototada was also, as you all know, someone who had served close to Ieyasu since his youth and had shared hardships and difficulties with him since the time when Ieyasu was a hostage in Suruga. He was sixty-two years old this year, but at this time he already foresaw that after Ieyasu's eastward journey, upheaval would surely occur in the capital region, and in that case there would be nothing but death in battle, so he recommended that Ietada, Ienaga and others should accompany the eastern expedition. However, Ieyasu refused this, saying it would leave too few people behind. He also instructed that if trouble arose and ammunition ran short, there were gold and silver ingots stored in the main keep that should be melted down to make more bullets - though I must say I would very much like to be shot with such bullets myself!

Thus Mototada and Ieyasu, knowing they would never meet again, spoke together of old times and shed tears. Mototada was left here with the aforementioned generals and only about 1,800

men to guard this castle.

Thus Ieyasu departed Fushimi on the 18th, passed by Ōtsu Castle to meet with its lord Kyōgoku Takatugu, then gradually entered Ise, reached Yokkaichi on the 20th, boarded a ship that night, reached Sakushima on the 21st, and arrived at this Yoshida on the 22nd. Earlier, Ikeda Terumasa had already returned to his domain and was preparing for military action, so at this time he entertained Ieyasu and others in the castle. On this day, after the entertainment ended, Ieyasu advanced to Shirasuka, then gradually proceeded along the Tōkaidō, making contact with the various castle lords along the way - namely Horio Tadauji of Hamamatsu, Yamauchi Kazutoyo of Kakegawa, Nakamura Kazuuji of Fuchū, Nakamura Kazuhide of Numazu, and Ōkubo Tadachika of Odawara - then passed through Fujisawa to Kamakura for falconry, finally arriving at Edo Castle on the 2nd day of the 7th month.

As you know, Ikeda Terumasa accompanied this expedition together with his younger brother Nagayoshi at this time. Then Ieyasu departed Edo again on the 21st and reached Oyama in Shimotsuke on the 24th, where the vanguard was stationed under Hidetada's command at Utsunomiya. At this time, Date Masamune responded to Ieyasu by deploying troops and had already captured Shiraishi Castle on the 24th. On this night, while Ieyasu was at Oyama, he received an urgent report that Fushimi Castle was under attack by Mitsunari and others.

Of course, Ieyasu had already known before departing Edo that trouble had arisen in the capital region, but since the timing was not yet right, he had proceeded this far with his expedition. However, urgent reports from the capital region continued to arrive, and on the 24th, as I mentioned before, the aforementioned report reached the camp at Oyama. He finally made his decision and gathered Hidetada and the various allied generals for consultation. In the end, the opinion of Fukushima Masanori and other allied generals was that if Ieyasu truly intended to serve Hideyori according to Hideyoshi's dying wishes, then they should oppose Mitsunari to the end and assist Ieyasu, and thus they decided to turn their army westward.

Fukushima Masanori and Ikeda Terumasa became the vanguard and began marching west in succession from the 26th. Among the Tokugawa hereditary retainers, Ii Naomasa was supposed to accompany this vanguard, but he suddenly fell ill and could not participate, so Honda Tadakatsu took his place and departed first toward Kiyosu in Owari on the 8th day of the 8th month.

Toyohashi Historical Discussion　　(Ninrengi Castle and the Toda Clan)　　　　　　　　　　40

Indeed. Now, this person Munemitsu was from a branch family of the Sanjō house, being the son of Inner Minister Kimiyasu, but one theory states that Dainagon Kimiharu had a son named Saneoki, who took up residence in Ōmi Province, and this person's son, Sanemitsu, was the first to come to Mikawa and live in Tahara, adopting the maternal family name "Toda" (originally written as "Jūda") and later changing it to Toda, making him Munemitsu's father. However, when compared with records such as the Kuge Bunin, this theory does not seem to correspond with the facts, so the previous theory appears to be correct. Also, the theory that Sanemitsu was Munemitsu's original name is found in the Kōsei Yoroku, and I think this should be accepted. There is also a theory that Munemitsu first lived in Toda in Kaitō District, Owari Province, and thus took the name Toda clan, but this also has absolutely no evidence and cannot be believed. However, that Munemitsu came to Ueno in Hekikai District, Mikawa Province, succeeded to the position of Toda Danjō, called himself Toda Magojirō, later changed to Danjō Saemon-no-jō, and married a daughter of Matsudaira Izumi Nyūdō Nobumitsu is supported by various evidence. Since it would be too complicated to discuss each point here, I won't elaborate, but I believe it should be accepted. Later, Munemitsu moved to Ōtsu in Atsumi District, and according to the Namiue Toda clan family records and two or three other records, this occurred in Bunmei 8. At that time, there was someone named Isshiki Hyōbu-shōyū Yoshitō living in Tahara, who died on the first day of the fourth month of Bunmei 13. This is recorded in the records of Chōkōji temple in Ōkubo, Atsumi District, and Higashi-Kannon-ji temple, among others. Munemitsu then succeeded the Isshiki clan and first established his base in Tahara. Namely, the temple called Chōkōji was built by Munemitsu in Bunmei 14 for the repose of the Isshiki clan, which is also recorded in the records of Chōkōji and elsewhere. For these reasons, as I mentioned before, dating Munemitsu's residence in Tahara to the Meiō period is inappropriate, and it must logically be around Bunmei 13-14. Therefore, the theory that at the beginning of the Meiō period he handed over Tahara Castle to his son Norimitsu while Munemitsu himself built a new castle at Ninrengi and moved there seems reasonable. This is what the Kōsei Yoroku discusses in detail, and this book called "Toda Family Lineage Correction Records," as I have mentioned repeatedly before, includes the "Study of Yoshida Castle Lords" as one part, totaling fourteen volumes. They are all manuscript copies, and the original is in the possession of the Toda

《Side note: Toda Family Lineage Correction Records》　Viscount family (Matsumoto lord). It was compiled during the Tenpō period by a retainer of the Toda house named Suzuki Jūkai, who seems to have spent about ten years on it. It is an extremely detailed investigation, and the arguments are generally recognized as accurate, so I think anyone studying the Toda clan should definitely refer to it at least once. Now, when this person Munemitsu was still living in Ueno, Hekikai District, he joined with Matsudaira Nobumitsu in Kanshō 6 to suppress a Mikawa uprising. This is a famous story that I briefly mentioned in the previous chapter. However, what I described then was truly simple, and looking at the written record, there seem to have been some misstatements, so I would like to make corrections and provide an overview here again.

Indeed, the most reliable record of this matter is the diary of the famous Ninagawa Chikamoto. In this diary, in the section for Kanshō 6, there are many drafts of official documents that Chikamoto and others from the Muromachi shogunate, including Ise Sadachika and Ninagawa Atsuchika, sent to Munemitsu and Nobumitsu. In all of these, they are written as "retainer Toda Danjō Saemon-no-jō Munemitsu" or "retainer Matsudaira Izumi Nyūdō." However, the Imagawa-ki records these two as "gokenin of Mikawa Province," so there are theories in the Hankanfu and elsewhere, but in any case, from the Muromachi shogunate's perspective, they were gokenin and retainers of Ise Sadachika, which seems to be the established theory. In particular, on the seventeenth day of the fourth month of Kanshō 6, Munemitsu went up to Kyoto and met with Ise Hyōgo Sadamune, an attendant of the Muromachi shogunate. At that time, he was entrusted by Ninagawa Kamon-no-suke Atsuchika with the position of deputy administrator of his domain, Ōhira in Nukata District, Mikawa Province.

《Side note: Kanshō 6 Mikawa Uprising》　However, Mikawa provincial warriors such as Maruyama Nakatsukasamaru and Ōba Jirōzaemon and others fortified themselves at a place called Inokuchi in Nukata District and committed violent acts. The guardian at the time, Hosokawa Nariyuki, sent troops to attack and defeat them. Maruyama was killed in battle at this time, but the other leaders and of course the remaining party scattered and were difficult to deal with. Moreover, there was suspicion that Munemitsu and Nobumitsu were rather hiding these people, so Hosokawa Nariyuki made a request to Ise Sadachika. Therefore, on the twenty-sixth day of the fifth month, Sadachika sent word to both Munemitsu and Nobumitsu about pursuing them, and Atsuchika also sent word to Munemitsu. As a result, among the remaining party, a certain Maruyama was killed by Munemitsu at Ōhira, Ōba was captured and killed by Nobumitsu's forces at Fukamizo, and Munemitsu and Nobumitsu sent their heads to Kyoto.

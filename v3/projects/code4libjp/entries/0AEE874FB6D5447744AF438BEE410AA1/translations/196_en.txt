**Main Text:**
...memorize the learning texts and not forget them shall be the primary focus
1. Reading texts should preferably be without punctuation marks. One shall not add kana readings on one's own
1. Regarding the number of chapters to read aloud, until the teacher gives permission, one may read as many chapters as desired. Do not seek to learn much; simply focus on not forgetting what has been studied
1. Reading texts shall be limited to Classic of Filial Piety, Analects, Book of Poetry, Book of Documents, Book of Rites, Book of Changes, and Spring and Autumn Annals. Works like Mencius and Doctrine of the Mean may also be read. Generally, after reading these texts, the rest may be read independently, so constant review should be conducted without negligence
However, those who begin reading at fifteen or sixteen years or older should focus on memorizing two or three of the above works, and with that foundation they will be able to read other books. They should begin without shame of their age. Moreover, older students should all attend lectures together, which will be greatly beneficial
1. For lectures, limit to the following six works: Classic of Filial Piety, Analects, Book of Poetry, Book of Documents, Book of Rites, and Book of Changes. Others may be abbreviated depending on the time
1. For group reading, use Rites of Zhou, Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial, Zuo Commentary, Discourses of the States, and additionally Records of the Grand Historian, Book of Han, etc., to be conducted gradually for advanced students
1. During lectures, group reading, and individual reading, and indeed at all times in the academy, useless gossip is forbidden
1. Those with sincere intentions may, even outside regular days, arrange group reading, discussion meetings, poetry gatherings, etc., in consultation with instructors
1. If there are any instances of rudeness in the academy, supervisors should be immediately informed, and arguments or loud voices are forbidden
1. Young students should not become bored with reading and gradually become lazy, speak ill of teaching methods, or establish their own opinions based on their limited learning, forget their teachers' benevolence, and criticize them
1. Among officials and above, young persons should attend even more diligently without negligence and pay attention to all matters. In this way, the academy will become increasingly strict, and it will serve as encouragement for those of lower rank

**Main Text:**
1. Young persons attending the academy shall first maintain proper deportment, follow their teachers' instructions, attend every morning, diligently practice reading aloud, and focus on reviewing so as not to forget what they have learned. The academy is an important place for literary and martial training, so they shall not have any misconceptions, shall not associate with bad friends from youth, shall advance in good deeds, and shall be diligent in practice. In this way, parents will be at ease, which constitutes the greatest filial piety. Moreover, if they are diligent in learning, as they mature they will become clear about moral principles, will be capable of any duty, will naturally conduct themselves well, and will bring peace of mind to their lord. Therefore, they should gradually understand the intent of the previous articles and never have misconceptions

These points shall be observed
Bunka 3, Year of the Fire Tiger, 5th month (1806)

For these reasons, Nobuaki particularly encouraged literature and martial arts during his residence in the castle and worked to promote domain education. Later, after Ōta Kinshiro was invited, there was also a period when he served as an instructor at Jishūkan. I mentioned this in the previous chapter and believe there will be occasions to discuss it in later chapters as well. Now, since the educational policy toward samurai children was of this nature, it seems to have influenced the education of commoner children as well. I believe that at that time, Jishūkan was open to commoner children without particular objection. While some records state that commoner children were not permitted to enroll, I believe the reality was not that enrollment was refused, but rather that among commoner children, hardly any came to attend. Commoner children's education was largely conducted in terakoya-style schools. Calligraphy practice books from that time remain with a friend of mine, and borrowing them to examine reveals quite interesting material. They bear the date Kansei 12 (1800), and most consist of letter-writing exercises that truly reveal the nature of correspondence used by townspeople of that era. Moreover, they are all practical, consisting entirely of material that could be immediately useful in daily household life—something that I think should be greatly referenced. Particularly noteworthy is that the names of various districts in Yoshida city are listed next, which are most practical...

"...regarding this matter, I would like to ease the rice deductions even a little, but due to enormous expenses continuing year after year, our financial affairs are in critical condition, and we can no longer sustain our way of life. Regrettably, I cannot fulfill this intention. However, to at least demonstrate the spirit of my intentions, I will distribute a small amount of money that I have set aside from my portion of rice to everyone. Furthermore, if our financial affairs continue as they are, we may eventually be unable to support our retainers, which causes me deep concern. Therefore, I have ordered strict economy measures in all areas, so please take great care to ensure nothing fails, and strive to establish even greater economy. Of course, if you have any thoughts on proper procedures, please speak without hesitation. I have given detailed instructions to the senior retainers.
5th year of the Rabbit, 26th day"

**Financial Distress of the Daimyo**
From this we can truly understand the state of the daimyo's finances at that time, which I believe was ultimately due to the ripple effects of the shogunate's own financial difficulties. In any case, this directive is truly candid and provides good material for understanding the internal situation of the time. Next, regarding Jishūkan, the circular was as follows:

**Circular Regarding Jishūkan**
"Regarding the promotion of literary and martial arts, this has been repeatedly proclaimed since the previous lord's time. The matter of Jishūkan was also strictly proclaimed in the Hōreki and Bunka periods, and everyone has been devoted to diligent practice. However, literary and martial arts have again been strongly emphasized, and it is desired that skilled practitioners emerge. Therefore, Jishūkan affairs are to be conducted even more strictly, with appropriate officials appointed, and all arts are to be practiced continuously at Jishūkan. Each person should practice the arts they are devoted to as desired. Although new training halls have been ordered to be built, everyone should sincerely devote themselves to practice so that they may advance through diligent effort. Officials and younger men in particular should focus on their own training, and older men should also occasionally attend and offer guidance.
Additionally, everyone should diligently practice calligraphy and arithmetic without neglect.

1. Young men should diligently practice not only basic reading but also begin training in all arts. Until now there have been some young men who did not practice at all, but henceforth such individuals will have their parents strictly reprimanded, so please be aware of this."

1. When transmitting knowledge of books, the responsible officials shall evaluate the skills.

1. There may be difficulties due to insufficient training halls, but given the current circumstances, it is difficult to fulfill all wishes. Masters should coordinate so that training can proceed without hindrance.

"The above has been proclaimed, and it has been ordered by Lord Magojirōemon that this be communicated to all retainers. Please understand accordingly. The above.

"Various training sessions at Jishūkan were held daily at masters' residences on non-designated days, but since those devoted to various arts had to travel to different locations for training, it became difficult to maintain consistent practice. Therefore, one new sword training hall has been constructed, and training shall be arranged as follows, with daily alternating practice regardless of weather:

1. Archery training for both schools: alternating monthly, at the hour of nine, morning and evening shifts of half-day each, training at Jishūkan
Note: One hour daily of blank firing practice with firearms

1. Spear training: full day sessions
Note: One hour daily of Munen-ryū sword training with three implements
New training hall

1. Sword training for both schools: monthly alternation of half-days, same as archery training
Training hall repairs

1. Wooden horse and iai training for both schools: coordinated as above

1. Jūjutsu training for both schools: coordinated as above"

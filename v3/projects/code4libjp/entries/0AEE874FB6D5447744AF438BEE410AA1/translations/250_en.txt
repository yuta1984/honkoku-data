Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (The Ansei Purge and Ono Kozan) 474

**Main Text:**
The general trend was extremely anti-shogunate sentiment rising up, so even the Regent could do nothing about it, and if handled poorly, his own position would be in danger. Therefore, for the necessity of resolving this situation, Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami's journey to Kyoto became all the more urgent.

So finally the new Kyoto Deputy Sakai Wakasa-no-kami set out for Kyoto in late August, but Nagano felt it necessary to first thoroughly understand the current situation in Kyoto before his arrival there, so he secretly traveled as far as Kuwana to strategize together. However, the court was also secretly plotting countermeasures against this, and there were various complicated circumstances between Regent Kujō and the court messengers Kuga, Hirohashi, Madenokōji and other court nobles. But ultimately, as mentioned before, the anti-shogunate sentiment was truly vigorous, and this was greatly aided by the persuasive efforts and activities of those loyalist activists.

In the end, the situation reached a point where no matter what views the shogunate held, there was no hope of them reaching the Emperor's ears. Therefore the mission of Manabe Shimōsa-no-kami, who bore the great responsibility of traveling to Kyoto this time, was truly momentous. But with things steadily proceeding in this direction, it was inevitable that the conclusion could not be settled through ordinary means, and the occurrence of this Ansei Purge must be considered truly unavoidable circumstances.

**The Activities of Umeda Genjirō and Others**
Among the activists who worked most extensively in Kyoto at that time, the most influential was Umeda Genjirō. This man's given name was Sadaaki and his pen name was Unpin, and he was originally a retainer of the Sakai clan of Obama in Wakasa Province. Later he came to Kyoto and made Confucian learning his profession, acquiring many disciples. Following the school of Yamazaki Ansai, he devoted his heart deeply to the imperial house and disapproved of the shogunate's friendly relations with foreigners. Possessing strong principles, he worked actively in national affairs, and eventually his arguments reached Prince Shōren'in and Lord Takatsukasa, finally gaining importance among the court nobles.

When the shogunate arbitrarily signed treaties in Ansei 5 (1858), he became even more indignant about this and frequently made proposals to the imperial princes and court nobles.

In fact, the previous demand for the Three Houses or the Great Elder to come to Kyoto was originally their proposal. Moreover, even in the imperial edict granted to the shogunate, there were parts based on documents they had submitted, showing how much their influence had reached the court nobles. The well-known Rai Mikisaburō, Yanagawa Seigan, Andō Iwami-no-suke, Yoshida Shōin, Ukita Ikkei, and the monk Gesshō were among their comrades and the principal figures among them.

Moreover, these people steadily worked through connections with various court nobles' retainers—Kobayashi Minbu-gon-dayū, Mikuni Daigaku, Takahashi Hyōbu-dayū, Kanada Iori and others—so they had underlying influence sufficient to sway court deliberations in some cases.

However, since the new Kyoto Deputy Sakai Wakasa-no-kami was Umeda's former lord, when Wakasa-no-kami was appointed as Kyoto Deputy, Umeda sent a letter to Tsubouchi Magobee of the same domain informing him of the situation in Kyoto. But as a result of his deep devotion to the Ansai school of learning, he regarded Great Elder Ii's act of signing treaties as purely treasonous behavior and severely criticized it.

When this somehow came to the ears of Nagano Shuzen, it was intolerable. It immediately became clear to him that the source of court opposition was probably these people.

**The Growing Rift Between the Shogunate and Mito Domain**
Not only this, but the people of Mito domain, given the circumstances described earlier, naturally came to hold increasingly anti-shogunate sentiments. Even the granting of imperial edicts was accomplished through the mediation of Kusakabe Isaji, originally a Mito retainer then serving Satsuma domain, along with Mito's Kyoto representative Ukai Kichizaemon and his son Yukiyoshi. Of course there were various other circumstances involved, but these ultimately served to increase the shogunate's hatred even more.

In such circumstances, regarding the matter of an imperial command for the lifting of Nariaki's house confinement, which Mito people had lobbied for in Kyoto, they felt it necessary to first strike a blow against Great Elder Ii, so they sent word to the Edo residence...

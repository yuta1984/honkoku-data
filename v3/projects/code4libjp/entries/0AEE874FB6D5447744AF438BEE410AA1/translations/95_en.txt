"Rain falling, tomorrow shall return to Sanshū by your lordship's command - this concerns the domain transfer and women's relocation."

From this, it appears that the domain transfer had already been decided at this time, and he had to return home urgently to prepare for the move. Although Ietada was ill on the journey, he hurried along the road and arrived at his castle town of Fukōzu in Mikawa on the fifth day of the eighth month. On the eighteenth day, having already made preparations, he departed for Kantō, finally arriving in Edo on the twenty-sixth day, where he was appointed to Oshi Castle through a messenger. Moreover, on the twenty-ninth day, he personally entered Oshi and received the castle from Matsudaira Suō-no-kami, so it seems that most other generals completed their transfers in similar haste.

Although Ieyasu's new territory was called the eight provinces of Kantō, the Satomi clan controlled Awa and the Utsunomiya clan controlled Shimotsuke, so Ieyasu's direct control extended to only six provinces. Even within these, various clans such as Yūki, Sano, and Minagawa still held separate territories, and moreover, remnants of the Hōjō clan were hiding throughout the region, making administration truly difficult.

However, from Hideyoshi's perspective, this was quite a clever strategy. While he gave Kantō to Ieyasu, he enfeoffed Gamō Ujisato in Aizu to control his rear, placed his own trusted retainers in the Tokugawa clan's former domains, gave Owari and Ise to Hidetugi, stationed Ishida Mitsunari at Sawayama in Ōmi, and placed Hidenaga in Yamato - this arrangement was extremely well-planned and thorough.

So Ieyasu distributed the lands of these six provinces among his retainers, which he announced on the twenty-third day of the eighth month. Regarding those connected to eastern Mikawa: first, Sakai Ietsugu, who had been lord of Yoshida castle, was enfeoffed with 30,000 koku at Usui Castle in Kōzuke; Matsudaira (Toda) Tanba-no-kami Yasunaga, lord of Nirengi castle, received 10,000 koku in eastern Musashi; Toda Samon Kazuaki, who was in Yoshida at that time and ancestor of the present Count Toda (former lord of Ōgaki), received 5,000 koku at Kushirai in Musashi; Makino Uma-no-jō Yasunari of Ushikubo received 20,000 koku at Ōgo in Kōzuke; Makino Sanuki-no-kami Yasunari received 5,000 koku at Ishido in Musashi; and others - Matsudaira Ietada of Fukōzu received 10,000 koku at Oshi in Musashi as mentioned earlier; Okudaira Nobumasa received 20,000 koku at Miyazaki in Kōzuke; Honda Hirotaka received 20,000 koku at Shirai in Kōzuke; Suganuma Sho-daizen Sadatoshi received... in upper

...province Yoshii 20,000 koku; Matsudaira Genba-no-kami Kiyomune received 10,000 koku at Hatayama in Musashi; Suganuma Yamashiro-no-kami Sadamasa received 10,000 koku at Sōma in Shimōsa; Suganuma Shinhachirou Sadamitsu received 10,000 koku at Abu in Kōzuke; Honda Nui-no-suke Yasutoshi received 5,000 koku in the Sakura domain in Shimōsa; Toda Saburōemon Tadatsugu received 5,000 koku at Shimoda in Izu; Saigō Magokyūrō Iekazu received 5,000 koku at Koyumi in Shimōsa; and Shitara Jinsaburō Sadamichi received 3,000 koku at Reha in Musashi.

In addition to these, Ii Naomasa, Honda Tadakatsu, and others all received appropriate territories. In any case, the people I mentioned earlier had their bases within eastern Mikawa, centered around this Toyohashi area, or were consistently connected to this region throughout - these were the people involved in the various battles and eastern Mikawa history that I have described at length. Since these individuals left Mikawa, where they had lived for many years, to undertake the development of Kantō, the relationship between Mikawa and Kantō is truly profound. Therefore, I believe that the center of this - present-day Tokyo, or Edo as it was then called - was indeed a place that gathered the essence of Mikawa.

[Pacification of Ōu] From there, Hideyoshi personally advanced to face Ōu, but since Date Masamune had already submitted during Hideyoshi's siege of Odawara, this region was also quickly pacified. Having completed the arrangements, he began his triumphal return on the twenty-third day of the eighth month, passing through Edo and Kamakura, then ascending the Tōkaidō as usual, returning to the capital in the ninth month. Later, there were small disturbances in the Ōu region, but Gamō Ujisato, Asano Nagamasa, and others followed Toyotomi Hidetugi and conquered these, finally achieving the first complete pacification of the realm. Thus, the long period of warring states came to a major conclusion, but I would like to discuss Hideyoshi's land surveys here.

[Hideyoshi's Land Surveys] Although there are theories that Oda Nobunaga had already conducted land surveys, there seems to be no clear evidence for this. However, as Hideyoshi was about to unify the realm, he conducted these land surveys throughout the entire country, attempting to standardize the various calculation methods that different provinces had used for land and tribute rice. The new system established one bu as six shaku and three sun of the curved ruler, and one se as thirty bu...

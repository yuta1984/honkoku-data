**Encouragement of Literature**
As I have frequently mentioned before, Nobuaki actively encouraged martial arts during his tenure to revive the fallen samurai spirit. However, he was not only that - he was also a great promoter of literature and contributed significantly to improving public morals and hearts through this means. Of course, some of these initiatives originated from Sadanobu's ideas, but as I mentioned earlier, Sadanobu held important positions for only seven years. After that, Nobuaki took complete charge of all these enterprises. First, regarding the revival of the Confucian Academy (Seidō), its completion was achieved primarily during Nobuaki's tenure as the responsible leader.

**Nobuaki and Koga Seiri**
While the famous scholars Bitō Jishū and Shibano Ritsuzan were summoned during Sadanobu's term, Koga Seiri was called to service during Nobuaki's time as senior councilor.

**Compilation of the Kansei Genealogies**
The compilation of the Kansei Revised Genealogies of Various Houses (Kansei Chōshū Shokafu), which I described in detail much earlier, can truly be called Nobuaki's achievement. This work followed the Kan'ei Genealogies and Jōkyō Records, correcting their errors and omissions. It has become the sole and most important source for the history of warrior families. This massive work consists of 1,525 volumes. Hotta Masaatsu, whom I mentioned before, was appointed as the chief editor, while Hayashi Jussai served as supervisor, and scholars like Narushima Shizhoku and Yashiro Kōken participated in the project. The work began in Kansei 11 and was finally completed in Bunka 9, taking fourteen years. Of these fourteen years, except for about two and a half years from December of Kyōwa 3 to May of Bunka 3, Nobuaki served as senior councilor throughout. I am convinced that Nobuaki's leadership and guidance played an indispensable role in this enterprise.

**Compilation of Tokugawa Jitsuroki and Chōya Kyūbun Hōkō**
Furthermore, the well-known compilation of the "True Records of the Tokugawa" and "Collection of Old Stories from Court and Country" also involved Jussai and Shizhoku. This project began in Bunka 6, when Nobuaki held the most influence as senior councilor, and was completed in Kaei 2. These too are massive works that remain important historical treasures for the Tokugawa period today.

I believe there were no other literary enterprises of such magnitude throughout that entire era.

**Nobuaki and Inō Tadayoshi**
Inō Tadayoshi's coastal surveys and creation of maps of our country also took place largely during Nobuaki's time in power. As I mentioned in the previous chapter, magnificent maps still remain with the Ōkōchi family today. Naturally, Nobuaki had significant involvement in this project as well. He was also the first to employ Ōta Kinjō as a Confucian scholar for his domain, but I plan to discuss Kinjō in detail in a later chapter.

**Afforestation at Mount Nikkō**
As I mentioned extensively before, the person who planted numerous cedar trees at Mount Nikkō and along its roads was Masatsuna, the uncle of Nobusuna. Since some of these cedar saplings died each year, the Ōkōchi family of Ōtaki, descendants of Masatsuna, had to work hard and spend money on replanting for generations. Following this ancestral legacy, Nobuaki also planned an afforestation project at Mount Nikkō in Kyōwa 1. A monument that Nobuaki erected at the afforestation site still exists, with the following inscription:

"In the land called Kayano, located east of Harigaya Village in Kawachi District, Shimotsuke Province, south of the Ōya River, west of Shionoshi Village, and north of Yanoguchi Village, within boundaries of 25 chō and 8 tan, planted 150,000 pine and cypress seedlings. Also dug irrigation channels around them to prevent wildfires, hoping that with time they will grow thick enough to embrace, serving as materials for repairing the two mausoleums at Mount Nikkō."

Unfortunately, I have not yet had the opportunity to see this monument myself, so I cannot state definitively whether it still exists today. However, according to someone's account, this forest has now flourished and become tremendously valuable.

There are still many more stories about Nobuaki's achievements, but I would like to conclude this chapter after mentioning one or two more important matters. This concerns something from Nobuaki's much younger days, carried out in Kansei 7. As I mentioned before, following the corrupt Tanuma administration, society had become truly indolent, so there was great need to inspire the samurai spirit. For this reason, on March 5th of that year, Shogun Ienari personally led a great hunt at Kogane Plain.

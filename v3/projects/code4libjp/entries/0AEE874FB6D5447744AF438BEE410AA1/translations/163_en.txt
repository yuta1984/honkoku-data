...cannot be listed here. Also, this is unrelated to Nobutoki, but in Kyōhō 2 (1717), the Benzaiten shrine now located within the grounds of Minatomachi Shinmei Shrine was built, with people from Funamachi collecting donations for its construction. Of course, it is not the current hall, but since this garden pond was designed by Yamada Sōhen as I mentioned earlier, there must have already been a Benzaiten hall at that time. I believe it was rebuilt due to damage this time. Looking at it now, that donation ledger is truly fascinating. This donation ledger still remains in Funamachi's warehouse.

**Subdivision: Nobutoki's wife, Lady Kyōgoku** ⦿ Kyōgoku and Nagai-no-Tsubone

What I definitely want to discuss here is the matter of Nobutoki's wife, Lady Kyōgoku. As I have mentioned repeatedly before, this Lady Kyōgoku was named Tane and was the daughter of Kyōgoku Bitchū-no-kami Takatoyo, lord of Marugame Castle in Sanuki. She became the adopted daughter of her grandfather Sakai Utanokami Tadaoki and married this Nobutoki on April 10th of Hōei 1 (1704). She lived to seventy-three years of age, passing away on December 16th of Hōreki 11 (1761), and was called Shōsen-in. Many examples of her handwriting still remain in the Ōkōchi family, with over thirty letters in particular. Those from her prime years show excellent calligraphy, all sent from Edo when her husband Nobutoki was in his domain. Moreover, while the letters are filled with deep affection, they also have a dignified quality that makes them quite exemplary. However, her later writings, perhaps due to illness, all show trembling handwriting and are quite difficult to read. These were mostly sent to her son Nobuaki after he had already become domain lord and was residing in his domain, and they show no small amount of maternal affection that can be deeply felt. In any case, it is clear that she was a virtuous woman, not an ordinary person. Among the women who came with this lady from the Kyōgoku family was one called Nagai-no-Tsubone, who also had an extraordinary personal history. Regarding the biography of this Nagai-no-Tsubone, it was once written in novel form in Tokyo's Jiji Shinpō some years ago, and it is also recorded in a book called "Beauties of Sanuki" recently published by Mr. Tsuda Jusei of Marugame in Sanuki.

Now I would like to tell you the main points here. This Nagai-no-Tsubone's real name was Amasaki Satoya, and she was born in Kazefukuro-machi in Marugame. Her father was a foot soldier in the Kyōgoku family's archery unit named Amasaki Kōemon. At that time, among Kōemon's colleagues was a man named Iwabuchi Den'nai, who was a scoundrel of very bad character. He became deeply infatuated with Satoya's mother, and one time, watching for when her husband Kōemon was away, he came to their house. At first he tried to seduce her with sweet words, but finally he attempted to resort to violence. At that moment, her husband Kōemon happened to return home from outside, so Satoya's mother immediately called her husband to another room and told him of this outrageous behavior. Thereupon Kōemon became extremely angry and confronted Den'nai about his rudeness, but since Den'nai was fundamentally a black-hearted scoundrel, he finally resorted to violence and killed Kōemon on the spot. Satoya's mother was greatly shocked to see this, but at that time Den'nai had already fled more than ten paces outside, so she had no choice but to take her husband's sword and throw it at Den'nai from behind. This successfully wounded his shoulder, but Den'nai still managed to escape and disappeared without a trace. The domain also searched for Den'nai's whereabouts based on this complaint, but could never find him. Satoya's mother, taking with her this Satoya who was two years old at the time, had no choice but to live as a dependent in the house of her husband's brother-in-law, a man named Sekine Motoemon. However, the constant worry day and night must have damaged her health, for though there was no particular cause of illness, she also died of sickness about half a year later, filled with infinite resentment. Thus this Satoya became an unfortunate orphan, but her uncle Motoemon thereafter raised Satoya as if she were his own child.

When Satoya turned thirteen, Motoemon first revealed the circumstances to her. Since Satoya had only thought that she was Motoemon's real child, she was shocked almost to the point of fainting. However, she pulled herself together and from then on served her uncle even more faithfully, though at this time Satoya had already resolved in her heart to take revenge. When Satoya reached eighteen years of age, she finally asked her uncle's permission to go to Edo, and this was truly the beginning of her path to revenge...

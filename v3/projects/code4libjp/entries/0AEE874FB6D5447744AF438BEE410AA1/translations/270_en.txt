**Main Text:**
I shall stop at just this, but it was truly a major incident for the times that shocked the hearts of people throughout the realm. In any case, it goes without saying that the shogunate greatly struggled with how to handle the aftermath, but first they persuaded Ii's retainers to keep the death of the Kamon-no-kami secret and earnestly advised the samurai against any rash actions. As for Sano Takenosuke and the others who carried out the attack, some died from their wounds, others committed suicide, and most of the rest turned themselves in, but all of these were sentenced to death by beheading in July of the following year. Regarding the Kamon-no-kami, they announced his dismissal from the position of Senior Councilor at the end of that month (March, Man'en 1), and simultaneously banned Mito Yoshiatsu from attending the castle. However, the next day, namely the first day of intercalary March, Kuze Yamato-no-kami Hirokane resumed his position as Senior Councilor, and by the first day of that December, this person was ordered to handle foreign affairs. Also, on April 28th, Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami was dismissed from his position as Senior Councilor, but at that time, among the cabinet ministers, Ando Tsushima-no-kami Nobumasa (Nobutomo) ultimately came to take charge of the main thrust of politics in place of the Kamon-no-kami. However, none could be called strong-armed politicians capable of following in the Kamon-no-kami's footsteps, so consequently their policies became quite moderate. I would also like to mention here that Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami Nobutaka, lord of Yoshida Domain, was appointed as Commissioner of Temples and Shrines on February 13th of last Ansei 6.

**The General Situation After Senior Councilor Ii's Assassination and Nobutaka's Appointment as Osaka Castle Keeper**

As stated in the previous chapter, it was Ando Tsushima-no-kami Nobumasa who took charge of shogunal administration after Senior Councilor Ii's assassination. This person had considerable talent and worked earnestly at his duties, but he was by no means as strong-armed a politician as Senior Councilor Ii. Particularly, as I mentioned before, the situation throughout the realm at that time was like a boiling cauldron, and Senior Councilor Ii's strong-arm tactics attempted to overwhelm this through high-pressure methods for a time, but since even he had fallen, there was no one capable of continuing the previous policies to their conclusion.

There was no strong-armed politician capable of thoroughly carrying out the previous policies, and even the Tsushima-no-kami gradually came to adopt moderate measures. However, in May of that Man'en 1, a Prussian envoy came requesting new commercial relations and concluding a treaty, and particularly the fact that the negotiation commissioner Hori Oribe-no-sho committed suicide made matters increasingly complicated. Although this Oribe-no-sho's suicide was recognized as being caused not by diplomatic matters but perhaps by illness, at the time these events became one cause leading unexpectedly to Senior Councilor Ando receiving the hatred of loyalist activists. Moreover, the rampages of loyalist activists became increasingly violent around that time, frequently attacking foreigners, and each time this happened, the shogunate was confronted with difficult negotiations by foreigners, causing no small suffering. With many other diplomatic problems immediately at hand, the only way to overcome these difficulties was to seek methods of court-shogunate unity, so Senior Councilor Ando, needing to implement so-called court-shogunate cooperation, finally petitioned for the marriage of Imperial Princess Kazunomiya Chikako, the emperor's sister, to Shogun Iemochi. Originally, I understand that the petition for Princess Kazunomiya's marriage was already planned during Senior Councilor Ii's time, but as you know, there were some internal circumstances involved, so Senior Councilor Ando's secret petition was once rejected in May of Man'en 1. However, the shogunate did not give up and continued to earnestly request permission thereafter, so on June 20th they finally received imperial approval. But when this matter soon leaked out, there was some unrest even among the court nobles, but among the so-called loyalist activists there was rather severe indignation, viewing the shogunate as having forcibly seized the imperial sister, and their anger was extreme. Consequently, Senior Councilor Ando's reputation became increasingly bad among the loyalist activists, and he gradually came to bear the full brunt of their resentment.

Thereafter, Princess Kazunomiya departed Kyoto on October 20th of Bunkyū 1 (Man'en lasted only one year before the era name changed to Bunkyū), traveled eastward via the Nakasendō route, and on February 11th of the following second year, the joyous wedding ceremony with Shogun Iemochi was finally held.

Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (The Rise of Anti-Foreign Sentiment) 456

**Main Text:**
As you all know, it was with Motoori Norinaga that [National Learning] truly came to demonstrate its essence. Regarding the National Learning scholars in our Yoshida, I had already opened just the beginning of that discussion in the previous chapter, so there should be more to add gradually. In any case, I believe it is a fact that the rise of such antiquarian studies stimulated our nation's inherent national character and encouraged its awakening.

At this point, the great problem of foreign relations arose. Initially, everyone believed in nothing other than the idea of maintaining isolationism at all costs. Of course, there were a few enlightened individuals who advocated that coastal defense could not be neglected for even a day, and that isolationism was ultimately untenable given world progress, but at that time such ideas were hardly accepted.

However, as foreign ships arrived more frequently and applied various pressures, and as understanding of world conditions gradually developed, people began to realize that isolationism and anti-foreignism were ultimately impractical.

But this was a mindset that emerged only among leading figures - the isolationist thinking that had been firmly entrenched among the majority of our people for many years could not easily be unraveled. Under these circumstances, the rise of anti-foreign sentiment was a natural trend, but needless to say, the Tokugawa shogunate at that time completely lacked the power to suppress it effectively. This was the fundamental cause that led to the fate I described earlier.

*Subheading: The Shift in Power at the End of the Shogunate*
In essence, encountering the unprecedented great problem of opening the country, combined with the shogunate's lack of power to overcome entrenched isolationist arguments and suppress opposition, ultimately merged well with our nation's inherent national character to give rise to arguments for seeking imperial permission. This is, of course, speaking in general terms, but perhaps when examined closely, this might be considered a subtle aspect of our national polity. At least, I think this is a point that students of Restoration history should pay close attention to.

Given these circumstances, in December of Ansei 4, the shogunate decided to conclude a treaty and had Inoue and Iwase begin negotiations with Harris. Simultaneously, they had Kyoto Deputy Wakizaka Awaji-no-kami, through the court nobles Hirohashi former Chief Counselor Mitsunari and Higashibojō former Chief Counselor Satosa, and via Chief Advisor Kujō Naotada, petition that trade and the residence of foreign officials be permitted, with the location and duration of such residence to be determined by considering domestic public sentiment, and that while the port of Shimoda would be closed, a replacement port would be determined through negotiations.

Furthermore, adopting Kawaji Saemon-jō's proposal, they dispatched special envoys to report on foreign affairs developments and to respond to imperial inquiries from Kyoto, ordering Hayashi Daigaku-no-kami [name withheld] and Inspector Tsuda Hanzaburō to proceed to the capital on the 11th. On the 15th, they issued instructions to all feudal lords permitting foreign trade and announcing major reforms to ancient institutions. Further, on the 29th, they specifically ordered the lords of the antechamber, main corridor, and great hall to appear at the castle, where each was granted a separate audience with the shogun. Afterward, with the senior councilors in attendance, they were asked to freely express their opinions on treaty conclusion. At these meetings, they also had the coastal defense officials, Chief Inspector Toki Tanba-no-kami, Inspector Udono Minbu-shōyū, and Iwase Higo-no-kami attend to give detailed accounts of the Harris negotiations.

This same procedure was carried out on the last day of the month for lords of the imperial audience chamber and below, while for the three Tokugawa branch families, coastal defense officials were specially dispatched to explain the situation.

However, the aforementioned Nariaki, who had been harboring various resentments recently, on this occasion too directed harsh words at the envoys Kawaji Saemon-jō and others, denouncing Senior Councilors Bitchū-no-kami and Iga-no-kami, and even went so far as to demand that both should commit seppuku and Harris should be beheaded.

*Subheading: Nariaki's Inflammatory Remarks*
Indeed, Nariaki at this time was quite different from before, becoming increasingly extreme, which not only distanced him from the shogunate but ultimately reduced his sympathizers - truly an unavoidable situation.

Now, the shogunate's two envoys, Hayashi Daigaku-no-kami and others, after arriving in Kyoto, promptly reported through the court nobles, first outlining the main points of dealings with foreigners since Perry's arrival in Kaei 6, then covering Harris's visit to Edo and treaty negotiations, also conveying the shogunate's intentions, and ultimately describing overseas conditions...

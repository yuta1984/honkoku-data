to recruit like-minded people and depart for the capital again. From then on, after consultation with Shidō, Seiken finally gave up his temporary residence in Negishi and established a house in Akasaka, publicly opening a Western studies school. The first to enter this private school were Sekine Shidō, then Abe Taizō who had come to the capital from Yoshida around that time, and others including a certain Isobe from a farming family in Yoshida, a certain Mitsuhashi who was a samurai from Amagasaki Domain, Iso Harusaku who was a physician from Kurohane, and a certain Ido who was a bakufu official.

(Seiken Opens a Western Studies School) Of course, among these, someone like Abe Taizō had initially studied under Konan Setsuan together with the current Doctor of Medicine Ōsawa Kenji and others, and later studied under Ono Kozan. Since Sekine Shidō's departure for the capital, these people also came to the capital in succession.

For this reason, Seiken had devoted himself entirely to teaching Western books from then on, but when Keiō 2 finally arrived, the world became increasingly tumultuous and noisy, and at a time when no one could predict what kind of upheaval might come, Domain Lord Nobuhisa felt greatly moved by something and urgently summoned Seiken back to the domain to assist in domain administration. So Nobuhisa summoned Seiken's father Kizaemon to convey this intention, and Seiken also considered this as a means to achieve his own aspirations, so he hastily closed his private school.

Seiken's Return to the Domain: He immediately returned to the domain residence within Gofukubashi, and was appointed as a public affairs official that same day, and was also ordered to teach Dutch studies to the younger men among the domain's close retainers. However, the storms of the realm became increasingly urgent, and the bakufu ordered each domain to quickly go up to Osaka and protect the shogun, but among the feudal lords there were quite a few who observed the situation and resolutely did not respond to the command, all hesitating and wavering. At this time, Seiken advised Domain Lord Nobuhisa that they should quickly obey the imperial command and go up to Osaka, but since overland travel was extremely inconvenient, he negotiated with the bakufu's naval department to borrow one of their ships, had the domain lord and his party board it, and he himself departed overland in October to secretly investigate conditions along the route.

Nobuhisa's Journey to Osaka: This was in Keiō 3, exactly when Shogun Yoshinobu had petitioned to return political power to the emperor. Domain Lord Nobuhisa accepted Seiken's proposal, and in November boarded the bakufu warship Hōshōmaru with domain retainers and departed from Shinagawa.

However, unfortunately they encountered violent storms and it took thirteen days before they could finally reach Tenpōzan. That is, they departed from off Shinagawa on December 13th (the previous mention of November was an error), but due to encountering strong winds they took shelter at Itakōra in Izu, and when they departed from there on the 18th, due to wind and waves they had to return to Itakōra again, departed from there again on the night of the 20th, took shelter at Toba in Shishū on the 21st, finally departed from there on the 23rd, and first reached Tenpōzan on the 25th (the ship was the Shōkakumaru, and the previous mention of Hōshōmaru was also an error).

However, as you know, the following year Keiō 4, that is, Meiji 1, in the first month there was the famous Battle of Fushimi-Toba, and former Shogun Yoshinobu secretly withdrew from Osaka on the 6th of that month, and on the following 7th boarded the Kaiyōkan from off Tenpōzan and fled back to Edo by sea. The confusion within Osaka Castle at this time was indescribable, but in our Yoshida Domain, on the 6th they held a senior retainer meeting in the presence of the domain lord and greatly deliberated on the policy they should adopt.

(Heated Arguments in the Lord's Presence) At that time, the ardent pro-bakufu advocate was Seiken, but among them there were those who, seeing the bakufu's decline, argued that they should rather outwardly petition to be the vanguard of the former shogun's journey to the capital, and then midway reverse their position when they saw the opportunity. At this time, Seiken placed his hand on his sword and shouted loudly, denouncing this as wrong, but the assembly finally decided on military service.

However, that very night they received secret intelligence that the former shogun had departed eastward in consternation aboard the Kaiyōkan with two or three retainers, so Domain Lord Nobuhisa also suddenly decided to return to his domain, and that same night, also taking only two attendants, escaped very secretly via the Ise route and returned to this Yoshida.

(Nobuhisa Also Secretly Escapes Osaka and Returns to Yoshida) However, when Seiken and others came out at dawn the next morning having prepared for military service, the scene was truly desolate and the situation had changed. When they learned of this matter, unable to bear their indignation, Seiken that day kicked and smashed the three ritual stands that had been set up to celebrate the departure for battle, showing his determination that even if he became alone, he would remain in this Osaka Castle and return an arrow to the Satsuma-Chōshū forces. But within that time there were those who explained various advantages and disadvantages, and reluctantly everyone in groups of three and five also took the Ise route

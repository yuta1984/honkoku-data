but he continued to serve the Tokugawa clan and gained Ieyasu's trust. From then on, he rendered meritorious service to the Tokugawa in each military campaign. While his biography would be lengthy to describe, since it has little direct relation to this historical discourse, I will limit myself to stating only the main points.

Now returning to the previous topic, the one who succeeded Ōkōchi Nobumasa was his son Nobusada, but Nobumasa was initially called Magotaro. The temple called Kongōin in Teratsu was founded in Tembun 2 by this Nobusada as the family temple of the Ōkōchi clan, and it still exists today. Nobusada's grave is also within the temple grounds. This person died on the 8th day of the 9th month of Eiroku 1, and his son was the famous Ōkōchi Kinbei Hidetsuna.

Hidetsuna also used the childhood name Magotaro and was born in Tembun 15. As you all know, he was quite a famous person, and the present Teratsu castle ruins are said to be where this Hidetsuna resided. Originally this Teratsu castle was called Fusechō Castle, and even the previously mentioned Sadatsuna appears scattered throughout various records as the Fusechō magistrate. Therefore, it is certain that the Ōkōchi clan had traditionally been based around the Teratsu area, but whether the currently existing castle ruins date from before Hidetsuna's time is unclear. This Hidetsuna was a man of considerable intelligence and courage. According to the Ōkōchi genealogy, he had a dispute with Kira retainers, and thirteen retainers banded together to attack Hidetsuna, but he single-handedly wielded a naginata and defeated all thirteen, finally leaving the Kira house and seeking refuge with Ina Bizen-no-kami Tadamasa. This led to his being taken into service by Ieyasu and granted territory at Hiehara in Tōtōmi Province. However, there are various conflicting accounts of this matter. According to unofficial histories, it was his father Nobusada who was granted the Hiehara territory, while Hidetsuna consistently served Kira Yoshiaki, maintaining his loyalty until Yoshiaki's flight, enduring obscurity for forty-four years until in his old age he was reduced to seeking refuge with Ina Tadamasa. But this seems to be an unreasonable account. As you know, Ieyasu took Tōtōmi in Eiroku 12, which was naturally after Nobusada's death, so

the claim that Ieyasu granted Hiehara in Tōtōmi to Nobusada is unacceptable. Also, since Kira Yoshiaki joined the Ikkō-senshū rebellion and again opposed Ieyasu, ultimately being defeated and fleeing to Ōmi Province in Eiroku 7, Hidetsuna was only nineteen years old at that time. Even if some Kira remnants remained afterward and did not submit to the Tokugawa, forty-four years of obscurity is somewhat hard to accept. However, when the Ikkō-senshū rebellion first arose and Yoshiaki was about to join it, Hidetsuna together with Masatsuna argued against this and admonished Yoshiaki. Moreover, in the 2nd month of Eiroku 7 when Ieyasu had Matsui Tadatsugu attack Tōjō, Hidetsuna and Masatsuna were both fighting vigorously among the Kira forces. From this we can infer that Hidetsuna's seeking refuge with Tadamasa was naturally after this, and judging from various materials, it seems to have been in the late years of Genki or early years of Tenshō. And I believe it was undoubtedly this Hidetsuna who received the Hiehara territory from Ieyasu. Now regarding this place called Hiehara, there are no clear records from ancient times. However, there is still a village section called Hiehara within Sodeura village in Iwata District, Tōtōmi, and I believe it was in this vicinity.

Now this Hidetsuna was not only intelligent and brave but apparently also quite gifted in administrative affairs, for after entering Ieyasu's service he handled tax matters for both Mikawa and Tōtōmi provinces, though of course this was not his only duty. In his later years he was granted a residence in Takashōchō in Edo Kanda (said to be present-day Ogawachō) where he lived, but after retirement he became a monk and took the name Kyūshin. He died on the 13th day of the 9th month of Genna 4 at age seventy-three and was buried at Herinji temple in Iwatsuki, Musashi Province. However, this temple was later moved to Nobidome in the same province, so his grave still remains there, though a grave marker has also been erected alongside Nobusada's grave at Kongōin in Teratsu.

Hidetsuna had four sons, with the eldest being Hisatsuna and the second being Masatsuna. Hisatsuna succeeded his father Hidetsuna and also took the name Ōkōchi Kinbei, and his childhood name was also Magotaro like his father and grandfather. He was born on the 15th day of the 12th month of Genki 1 in Mikawa

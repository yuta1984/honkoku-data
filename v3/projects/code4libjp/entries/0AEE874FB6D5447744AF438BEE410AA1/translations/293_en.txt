Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Yoshida Domain During Its Residence in Osaka and Yamamoto Hayao) 560

　　　　　　　1. Cutting down traitors between Kyoto and Osaka is becoming increasingly active. Starting with the various officials of ○○ Palace, including Reizei Tanetaka, and in Osaka, Tenma magistrate's assistant Uchiyama Hikojirō (formerly a Kii domain retainer, currently an inner attendant of ○○ Palace in Kyoto) and two other townsmen were killed.

　　　　　　　　As things gradually approach, I believe ever more strongly in the single-minded devotion to imperial loyalty. I will write more in a later letter. Hastily written. End.
　　　　　　　　　　Written on the last day of the fifth month　　　　　　　　　　Hayao
　　　　　　　　　　　　　Rokurō-sama

　　　　　　From the above, we can clearly understand the depth of his imperial loyalist convictions. In a letter sent from Osaka to the same person the following year, namely in the first month of Genji 1 (1864), his intentions are even more clearly revealed. We can sense that Hayao's resolve had already become firm by this time, so I would like to introduce a passage from it below.

　　　　　　　　　　　　(Omitted above)
　　　　　　　I write in strictest confidence. The time for a great transformation of the realm is truly approaching, and I believe the restoration of antiquity is not far off. Chōshū domain is also extraordinarily strong domestically, and the two men - Senior Councilor Shishido Kurōzaemon and Osaka resident representative Hōjō - are true imperial loyalists who have taken special pains regarding the Yamato rōnin matter, as I have learned privately. Also, all the Totsukawa rōnin are safe, though five or six among them were captured. The Mikawa Kariya rōnin all escaped safely to Chōshū, as I have learned for certain. No one in the realm knows of this - only one or two people know.

　　　　　　　1. I wish ever more to manifest my imperial loyalist heart, but it is still a bit early, so the time will surely come eventually. Though my affairs have reached various quarters, I must first properly settle the future of my aged mother and son, and then pursue my aspirations even more earnestly. Regarding this, if Kinoshirō could come to Osaka once, I would like to consult with him on various matters, so I humbly request that you send a letter from your end inviting him to Osaka.

　　　　　　　1. I have also been able to establish discussions with certain imperial loyalist daimyo, and I will report on palace conditions as I learn of them. The dedicated people in your area must

　　　　　　　　never let their hearts grow slack, and should earnestly promote imperial loyalty above all else. As for myself, I am already firmly committed to imperial loyalty, so if the Emperor calls up troops, I will immediately rush to serve. At that time, please by all means look after my mother, son, and household. However, I intend to return home temporarily first, so when it becomes late February, please say that my aged mother is ill. Then I would like to visit briefly in early March. I will write about this matter in more detail later. Give my regards to Natsume, Kamo, and Katō, and the same to Hatano.

　　　　　　From the above passage "if the Emperor calls up troops, I will immediately rush to serve," and what follows, we cannot help but be moved to tears. Furthermore, a letter sent to the same person around March of that year reveals the circumstances of the time even more clearly, so I will present its full text below.

　　　　　　　I respectfully write this letter. Though the spring has become warm, I rejoice that your entire household continues in good health. As for myself, I remain in Osaka without incident, so please be assured. Also, since you previously wrote that you will come to Osaka for duty next month, I await your arrival day by day. When you do come, I look forward to discussing imperial loyalty matters with you. Arrangements with various places are proceeding well, so I have various matters under consideration. Therefore, I eagerly await your arrival as soon as possible. However, the home domain also depends entirely on you, which is also a concern, but since this is a minor matter, I believe it cannot compare to the great cause. Also, as soon as this letter arrives, please quickly go to Master Hatano and tell him that although ○○ Lord has returned to the domain, he has absolutely no imperial loyalist intentions. Since Hatano is an honest and straightforward good man, it would be catastrophic if he were to tell ○○ Lord that I and others have imperial loyalist aspirations. Please absolutely keep this secret and request that Hatano not speak of me and others at all. When you come, I have so many things I want to discuss with you. Here in our domain, I am the only one with imperial loyalist aspirations - there are no others. Nakayama

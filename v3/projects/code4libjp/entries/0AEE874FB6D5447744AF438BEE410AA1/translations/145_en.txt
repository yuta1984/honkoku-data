On the 28th day of the 12th month of Kanbun 12, he was appointed to the court rank of junior fifth rank, lower grade, and governor of Izu Province. On the 7th day of the 1st month of Genroku 7, he was transferred from Kawagoe Castle to Koga Castle in Shimōsa Province. On the 18th day of the 6th month of Hōei 6, by his own request, he passed the family headship to his son Nobutoki (then called Nobutaka), and he himself retired, shaved his hair, and took the name Sōken. On the 18th day of the 6th month of Kyōhō 10, he died at the age of sixty-six and was buried at Heiruji Temple like the others, receiving the posthumous name Shinryūin.

**Nobuteru's Letters** I would like to say a little more about this Nobuteru, as I believe this person was truly someone of deep affection, particularly rich in compassion for those beneath him. Two letters from this person remain at the Ōkōchi house today, both sent to the wife of his son Nobutoki.

**Lady Otane** These letters truly contain something deeply affectionate and admirable. One of these letters reads as follows:

"Your letter of the 23rd, receiving it in particular brings me satisfaction. First, I rejoice to hear that you are in good spirits and leisurely taking the hot spring baths. As you wrote, Izunokami also returned to the capital successfully and had his audience, bringing great joy. Since the Ōtsuka and Imasato brothers are also in good health, you need not worry. The weather here has been unstable lately - how is it there? It has been clear since yesterday, bringing satisfaction. Seeing various rare sights here and there for entertainment has been most pleasant. Especially since the hot springs are suitable and your appetite is good, this brings the greatest satisfaction. Things here remain unchanged, so you need not worry. As you wrote, not having met for so long makes me yearn to see you. With further congratulations and respectfully,

4th month, 27th day     Matsudaira Sōken
In reply to Lady Otane"

This letter is a reply to one sent by the wife of his eldest son Nobutoki, a woman named Tane, who was at a hot spring at the time. The "Izunokami" mentioned in the text refers to Nobutoki, who was Lady Otane's husband. The sentiment in this letter shows such deep affection that it surpasses even that of commoners, and I find it remarkably kind. The other letter was sent when Nobuteru was in his domain,

before his retirement, sent to Lady Otane who was in Edo at the time. In it, he reports on a child's development:

"Kansai is quite mischievous, climbing high trees and playing - it's something to laugh about."

It's unfortunate that I cannot determine who this "Kansai" refers to, but the thoughtful way this letter is written gives us a glimpse into the living conditions of daimyō children of that era, which I find quite delightful.

**[Marginal note: Letter from Ryūsenin]** There is yet another letter remaining at the Ōkōchi house, sent from Terutsuna's wife - that is, Nobuteru's mother, Ryūsenin - to Nobuteru. This was when Nobuteru was stationed in his domain, presumably at Koga Castle at the time, sent from Lady Ryūsenin who was in Edo. The true feelings between mother and son are truly evident to see. I believe this also serves as a valuable reference for understanding the conditions of that time, so I will include it below:

"Again and again I rejoice to hear you are in good spirits - this brings me satisfaction. I look forward with joy to meeting you soon. With congratulations and respectfully,

Your letter brought me great joy. As you say, it is still extremely hot, but I am satisfied to hear you are in good spirits there. Things here remain unchanged, I am in good health, at the upper residence Kamechiyo is also well, at both places under Ukyō's care all are well, and at Asakusa too all are well. Since the sankin [attendance] is drawing near, I joyfully await meeting you with pleasure. Regarding this matter, I too will visit Ukyō's place and spend leisurely time there with joy. As I write to you, Kamechiyo too is being good and quiet, staying peacefully, which brings me joy. I hear that Lord Dewa's wife is in very good spirits. Tomorrow I too plan to visit Lord Dewa's wife to offer congratulations. I received some sweets with special wrapping from Lord Dewa, so I am sending them to you. With congratulations and respectfully"

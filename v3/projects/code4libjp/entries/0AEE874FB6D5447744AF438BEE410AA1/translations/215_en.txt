The problems became increasingly frequent, with not only English and French ships but also American vessels arriving. On February 6, Kōka 3 (actually said to be January 26), Emperor Ninkō passed away, and on the 13th of the same month, Emperor Kōmei ascended the throne at the age of 16.

Thus, during the confusion over foreign relations problems, Kōka 4 passed, and in the 5th year the era name was changed to Kaei. In the 2nd year of Kaei, on July 27, Nobuaki died of illness at the age of 21. He was also buried at Heirin-ji temple in Nobidome and given the posthumous name Bankiin.

Thus Nobuaki's rule as domain lord lasted only slightly over five years, from Kōka 1 to Kaei 2, which was not very long. However, the political upheavals centered on foreign relations problems were truly considerable during this period.

At that time, as mentioned before, the shogunate's financial difficulties had reached their extreme, and domains like Yoshida were greatly affected by these repercussions. The following directive issued to retainers on July 28, Kaei 1, truly reveals the internal situation:

"Regarding financial matters, in recent years there have been unavoidably enormous extraordinary expenses, and consequently debts have gradually increased to massive proportions. Without large annual borrowings, we cannot even pay the interest, and this year we have reached a truly critical situation where continuation seems impossible. Though financial reforms should have been implemented before reaching this point, due to continuous massive extraordinary expenses year after year, there has been no opportunity to establish reforms. With such enormous debt, there is deep concern about future continuation. This is truly a serious matter, so future reforms for continuation must be established. Though various departments have already reduced expenses by 30%, we must implement even stricter economies and extraordinary reductions in expenditures. Everyone should understand this thoroughly, and if you have any ideas for such economies, please investigate and report them. All departments must implement extraordinary economies in their expenditures, and we must work to gradually reduce debt, however slightly, to ensure uninterrupted continuation."

"Regarding how these measures should be implemented, if you have any ideas, even if they may not be adopted, please feel free to submit written sealed proposals to the inspectors by the 10th. Those who have no particular suggestions may report orally to the inspectors."

There were frequent subsequent directives regarding debt consolidation, but the directive of September 4 of the same year represents the extreme situation, so I will present it below as reference for the financial condition of daimyo at that time:

"Our finances have long been difficult, and on top of this, Lord Shōtenin served in distant provinces, after which there was the fire at the western bailey requiring substantial tribute payments. Additionally, the main mansion was damaged by fire, requiring considerable reconstruction costs, along with unavoidable ceremonial expenses. There was no opportunity for financial reform, and the financial officials managed year by year through borrowing, but this only increased annual debt with no prospect of reduction. Currently the debt has reached massive proportions with no means of raising funds, creating a truly critical situation. When this was reported, His Lordship was deeply concerned, reduced his meals to a single dish, wore only cotton clothes daily, and ordered financial reforms. From this year's end until next year of the Ox, for five years, strict economies have been ordered. Even with interest reductions and annual payment plans for debts, reforms remain difficult. Though His Lordship deeply sympathizes with the hardships of retainers, due to unavoidable circumstances, stipends will be proportionally reduced during this period. Everyone must understand these unavoidable circumstances, implement strict economies in all matters, and somehow continue their duties. Since extreme poverty may lead to misconduct, everyone must thoroughly understand this. These reforms require unity between high and low, and through consistent discipline, finances will be restored and eventually rice allowances will be resumed. Everyone must thoroughly understand this, overcome hardships, maintain household discipline, and perform duties without negligence."

Of course, not all domains at that time had finances in such condition, but in any case...

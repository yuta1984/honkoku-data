Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Supplement: Regarding Hatano Takao) 522

**Main Text:**
...those with even a single skill or talent in Japanese, Chinese, or Dutch learning, as well as astronomy, surveying, geography, mathematics, navigation, shipbuilding, etc., should be sought out to fulfill the lord's requests. This determination is clearly evident in this written acceptance. This policy indeed became the beginning of Yoshida Domain's further opening its doors and promoting talented individuals. As I mentioned before, when the shogunal restrictions somewhat relaxed in the spring of Bunkyu 3, they immediately elevated Ono Kozan from house arrest and appointed him as a school instructor - I find this quite interesting as it contrasts greatly with this policy.

Now, Nobutaka departed Edo on September 2nd of that year and finally took up his post in Osaka. At that time in the shogunal council, as I mentioned before, Yoshinobu and Yoshinaga had become the shogun's guardian and chief of political affairs respectively, dealing with the current crisis. They first attempted to carry out major reforms of shogunal government. As their first step, they established matters concerning the repair of imperial mausoleums, made changes regarding the daimyo's alternate attendance system, and planned various other measures. Following the Three-Point Policy, they finally decided on the shogun's journey to Kyoto. Of course there were various arguments about this, but the advocate of this Kyoto journey theory was Matsudaira Yoshinaga, and Choshu Domain also greatly hoped for it. Moreover, Yoshinaga's expectation was to create an opportunity for court-bakufu cooperation, but unfortunately things went completely contrary to his intentions. In the end, even Yoshinaga himself eventually fled from that whirlpool, and the shogun's journey to Kyoto resulted in the fact that the center of political power shifted from Edo to Kyoto - this too was an inevitable consequence of the bakufu's declining influence.

**● Supplement: Regarding Hatano Takao**

At this point, I think it necessary to discuss a bit more about Hatano Takao beyond what I have already mentioned, so I would like to add this as a supplement.

Takao's real name, as I briefly mentioned before, was Sakaki. However, he personally wrote it as Sakaegi or Sakaki, and...

...Takao was his formal name. Also, his birth date has been determined to be February 14th, Kansei 10, so I will mention this here as well, regardless of repetition.

What I want to discuss here is Sakaki's loyalist activities. That Sakaki was an early loyalist is still well remembered by elderly people, but especially since the Ansei Purge of 1858-59, he increasingly demonstrated this spirit. As I described in detail in the previous chapter, Ono Kozan was imprisoned in Yoshida due to that purge, but as the restrictions gradually relaxed, Sakaki regularly visited Kozan and they found their spirits most compatible. At that time, Sakaki's secret protection of loyalist activists traveling east and west was no small matter, but beyond that, he frequently went up to Edo to observe the movements throughout the realm and report to his comrades, helping their plans on many occasions. Unfortunately, most of the correspondence from that time has been burned and discarded, with very few surviving documents, but items like those listed below reveal much about the situation of that time, so although somewhat lengthy, I will transcribe them one by one below.

"Though the lingering heat is severe, I trust that everyone continues in good health and fortune, which I consider most precious. Everyone here is also well, so please be at ease. Today I received word from so-and-so and write briefly to inform you. The other day I received your thoughtful letter and read it with humble gratitude.

First, you may have already heard quickly, but on the 21st of last month, Lord Hamamatsu was commanded to resume service and take the senior position among the councilors, which was truly surprising.

In addition:
- He was sent on official business to investigate the aftermath of the suspension of construction work at Inba
- He was sent on official business to investigate the aftermath of the suspension of construction work on the Tokaido at Fuchu and other places  
- He was appointed as courtier and general supervisor of Honmaru construction"

This was Nobuaki's proposal, and the Date family was greatly pleased and wholeheartedly responded to this domain order.

Now, the conduct of the Russian ships this time was not only utterly lawless as mentioned before, but last year they had even taken four of our garrison soldiers as prisoners before departing. With matters having reached this point, the shogunate could no longer maintain a neighborly attitude. Therefore, in Bunka 4 (1807), they had already ordered the coastal domains to strengthen their defenses and commanded:

"Should any suspicious ships be sighted, handle all matters according to the instructions issued in Kansei 3, keeping this in mind."

However, this Kansei 3 directive was not an extreme exclusion order. If foreign ships were discovered, inspection officials were first to conduct thorough investigations. If the ships resisted, both ships and people could be driven away without concern. But for those who did not resist, appropriate strategies should be used to moor their ships, allow crew members to land under strict supervision, and if they absolutely refused to comply, they could be arrested as a last resort, after which immediate reports should be made to the shogunate. This was applied again this time, but for some reason, no Russian ships were seen visiting thereafter.

However, in Bunka 8 (1811), in May, they came again to Kunashiri in Ezo. This time, the guard officials, seeking to retaliate for the previous year's outrageous acts, cleverly deceived the sailors into landing and captured eight of them. Among these eight was the famous captain Golovnin, and the details of these events are said to be recorded in his well-known account of his Japanese ordeal.

The remaining Russian crew members were greatly alarmed to see eight of their companions taken prisoner, but apparently judging that resistance was futile, they ultimately abandoned them and hurriedly set sail.

Two years later, the famous Takadaya Kahei's ship was attacked by a Russian vessel near Ezo waters. In May, the Russian ship came to Kunashiri with Kahei, claiming that the previous year's invasion was the work of unruly people and certainly not sanctioned by the Russian government, and that the government had now punished those unruly people, so they requested forgiveness and proposed an exchange of prisoners.

**Main Text:**

The Matsumae Magistrate sent an urgent messenger to the shogunate awaiting instructions, and the shogunate allowed the Matsumae Magistrate to permit the prisoner exchange, carefully explaining in detail why Japan had maintained its policy of national isolation, and generously supplied rice, salt, sake, and food before allowing them to depart.

Of course, at this time Nobuaki was the main responsible official in the shogunate, so it is natural to view this treatment as originating from Nobuaki's opinion. Comparing this with Jissai's opinions that have been discussed throughout this chapter, I believe it clearly reveals Nobuaki's foreign policy approach.

Indeed, the treatment at that time was most appropriate, and it appears that the Russian ships thoroughly understood our intentions, as they never visited our country again thereafter. Thus, the long-entangled and continuous foreign relations with Russia came to a conclusion at this point. I firmly believe without doubt that this fact deserves special mention as a matter of great importance in history.

Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, the administration of Ezo was steadily implemented according to the initial policy, but this required unexpectedly high costs with relatively little income, leading to gradual criticism. Consequently, the shogunate was quite troubled by this point, but during this period of administration, they never allowed foreign reconnaissance of our northern seas. Not only the Kuril Islands, but our authority extended far to Sakhalin as well. This was truly one of Nobuaki's lifelong great undertakings, and it was precisely because of this situation that our national territory remained intact. I believe this influence continued even to the time of the Meiji Restoration.

However, as mentioned before, Nobuaki passed away from illness on August 16, Bunka 14 (1817), at age fifty-eight. After his death, as frequently discussed before, the shogunate's political situation completely changed, and the aforementioned Mizuno Tadanari immediately became Senior Councilor

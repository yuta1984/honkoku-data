Some make the theory that the previously mentioned Dewa-no-kami Yasunari did not die in battle at Ushikubohara but was still alive, but if one carefully examines those documents, it becomes clear that this is certainly not the case. That is, I believe this "Dewa-dono father and son" refers to Dewa-no-kami Narimoto and his son. However, since this matter has little relation to our city's history, I would like to stop here.

Next is the story of Sadashige, ancestor of the Tanabe Makino family. As I mentioned before, this person is recorded in that family's genealogy as the grandson of Kohaku. According to the Furukawa genealogy, when Matsudaira Kiyoyasu attacked Yoshida Castle and Makino Denzō Nobushige and others died in battle, Sadashige was among the Yoshida Castle forces, was wounded, and retreated to the vicinity of Furukawa village (near present-day Ōmura), where Furukawa Katsumichi, an ancestor of the Furukawa family, helped him and brought him into Ushikubo Castle. From then on, this Katsumichi served under Sadashige like a retainer. Sadashige was initially called Hachidayū, later Yamashiro-no-kami, and also became a prominent figure at Ushikubo. This person died on the thirteenth day of the eighth month of Tenshō 1, and his son Yasushige was initially called Sōjirō Hanemon, later Sanuki-no-kami, and was quite a valorous person. That is, in Eiroku 8 he joined the Tokugawa clan together with his father, and thereafter achieved numerous military achievements alongside Toda Yasunaga, Makino Shinjirō Yasunari, and others.

**The Tea Jar Fine** There is an interesting story about this person. This happened much later in his life, but when Taikō heard that he had purchased an expensive tea jar, partly out of envy and partly in jest, he said that paying high prices for such playthings was unprofitable, so he should pay one gold piece as an excess payment fine to atone for his transgression, and he was ultimately fined. Afterward, Ieyasu would often bring up this matter and laugh about it, and even now that jar is preserved in the Tanabe Makino family and is called "the excess payment tea jar."

At that time, the Makino clan at Ushikubo had people with the same names or very similar names in the same period, as mentioned before. That is, in the Nagaoka Makino family the succession went Sadanari, Narisada, Yasunari, and this Yasunari was also initially called Sadanari like his grandfather. Moreover, in the Tanabe Makino family the succession went Sadashige, Yasushige, so their achievements are sometimes confused.

**The Golden Fan Horse Standard** Indeed, regarding the origin of the golden fan that was Ieyasu's horse standard,

there are various theories that cause considerable confusion. Regarding this golden fan, the "Ushikubo Secret Discussions Record" records it in two places. The first states that in Eiroku 8 when Ieyasu attacked Yoshida Castle, he rested at Shōgen Temple in Shimoji, and at that time Narisada, since this was his first battle after joining Ieyasu, thought he must achieve some merit, so he prayed before Prince Shōtoku and left two golden fans as offerings before departing. No one knew of this, but later a temple monk discovered these golden fans and reported it to Ieyasu, who said it was a mysterious and auspicious omen, and from then on Ieyasu used them as horse standards. It also states that Narisada, on Ieyasu's orders, negotiated the surrender of the castle with Ohara Shigezane and achieved great merit. However, as I mentioned before, at that time Narisada, whatever his private dealings, was still officially on the Imagawa side, so I cannot help but doubt this account.

However, the story that there was an auspicious omen with fans at this time and that Ieyasu used golden fans instead of a war fan in this battle is a tradition preserved in the Tokugawa family.

**The Tokugawa Family's Armor Celebration Day** The "Chōya Kyūbun Hōkō" also records that since this occurred on the twentieth day, Ieyasu thereafter designated the twentieth as the day for armor celebrations. Considering this, Narisada had already established communication with Ieyasu at that time, and the idea that he secretly prayed for his personal future before Prince Shōtoku is not entirely dismissible. The Secret Discussions Record may have added various explanations that actually increased doubts.

The second theory recorded in the Secret Discussions Record states that during the attack on Odawara in Tenshō 18, Ieyasu saw that Makino Hanemon was refraining from using his family's traditional fan horse standard out of deference to him, so he brought up the previous incident at Shimoji Shōgen Temple's Prince Hall and told him it was perfectly acceptable for him to also use a fan horse standard. Considering this, this Hanemon was none other than Yasushige, ancestor of the Tanabe Makino family, and naturally a different person from Narisada of the Nagaoka Makino family. However, bringing up the Prince Hall matter here is questionable, but Hanemon Yasushige's receiving golden fans from Ieyasu occurred in Eiroku 8, and after the Battle of Yoshida, Yasushige joined Ieyasu and first went to Okazaki for an audience in the twelfth month of that year. Of course, Narisada also accompanied him at this time, so in the official records...

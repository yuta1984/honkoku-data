Roughly as described above, this is an extremely complex genealogy. Therefore, from the Bunmei period through the Genki and Tenshō periods, the Suganuma clan spread throughout the mountainous regions of Eastern Mikawa. However, due to geographical circumstances, they often opposed the dominant forces and fell into unfortunate circumstances. Only the Noda Suganuma clan consistently maintained loyalty to the Tokugawa throughout, and though severely troubled by Imagawa Ujizane and Takeda Shingen, ultimately became the final victors. However, the Suganuma clans of Tamine and Nagashino were quite unable to understand the general situation, or were in positions where independence was impossible. They initially rebelled against Imagawa Yoshimoto and failed, and though they fortunately joined the Tokugawa side during the Eiroku 4 incident, later some followed Takeda Shingen and brought about their own destruction, which is truly pitiable. Particularly after the Tokugawa pacified the realm, even those houses that fortunately joined the ranks of daimyo all died out without heirs, and one cannot help but sympathize with the Suganuma clan.

The Okudaira Clan: So regarding the Okudaira clan, which together with the Suganuma clan is counted among the Yamaga Sanpō, what kind of family lineage was this? Concerning their origins, there are various theories about this as well, but it is said that Sadayoshi's great-great-grandfather, Saemon-no-jō Sadatoshi, first came from Kōzuke Province

to this Mikawa Province and took control of Tsukude. Sadayoshi's son was Nobumasa, who later became famous for the siege of Nagashino, but Sadayoshi's father was Kenmotsu Sadakatsu, who later became a monk and was called Dōmon. This Dōmon initially served Matsudaira Kiyoyasu but later belonged to the Imagawa clan. However, from around Eiroku 8, Sadayoshi again rebelled against Imagawa Ujizane and followed the Tokugawa, achieving considerable military merit. But in Genki 2, his father Dōmon and the rest of the clan joined Takeda Shingen. However, midway through, Sadayoshi resolved to separate from his clansmen and rejoined Ieyasu. There are detailed stories about these matters, but I will relate those gradually. Next, I would like to discuss the Matsudaira clans of Fukauzu, Takenotani, and Katanohara. These three Matsudaira houses, as mentioned in the previous chapter, descended from Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami Nobumitsu. Branch families were established during the generations of Nobumitsu's son Chikatada, his son Nagachika, and his son Nobutada, all of whom took the Matsudaira name. Looking at the lineages of those well-known today, they are roughly as follows:

○Nobumitsu's line:
　　Takenotani　　Katanohara　　Ōkusa　　Fukauzu　　Nōmi　　Nagasawa
○Chikatada's line:
　　Ōkyū　　Nishifukugama　　Anjō　　Takiwaki
○Nagachika's line:
　　Fukugama　　Sakurai　　Tōjō　　Fujii
○Nobutada's line:
　　Miki　　Udono

The author of the Ietada Nikki (Ietada's Diary), which is frequently referenced, Matsudaira Ietada, belonged to this Fukauzu Matsudaira clan, and as you know, the treasure...

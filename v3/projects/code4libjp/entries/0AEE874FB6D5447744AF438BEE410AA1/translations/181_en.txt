When we consider that he actually implemented these policies, we can imagine the extent of his struggles, and we can also infer that his character was extraordinary. Let me stop this story here for now, and I would like to discuss matters concerning Nobuaki and foreign relations.

**Matsudaira Nobuaki and Foreign Relations**

Originally, Russians first entered Ezo territory quite some time ago. In Meiwa 2, a Russian named Ivan Reenchich came to Reshaba Island in Ezo territory, and until the year after next, he wintered between Etorofu Island and Uruppu Island. When he departed, he committed violence against the natives, which is said to be the first such incident. Later, in An'ei 7, they landed at Nemuro seeking trade, and after that they came frequently, with some even settling in the Kuril Islands. Previously, this had been left entirely to the Matsumae lord, and the shogunate did not interfere much. However, by Tenmei 5, it could no longer be ignored, so the shogunate ordered Accounting Magistrate Matsumoto Izu-no-kami to dispatch his subordinates to Ezo territory for inspection, and they reported back the following year.

However, at that time, Shogun Ieharu had just died, and even after Sadanobu became assistant, he was too busy with the Tanuma affair and other matters. But in Kansei 4, the development of Ezo territory became truly urgent, so a man named Mogami Tokunai Tsunenori was dispatched.

This man had already conducted a solo expedition to the northern territories in Tenmei 6, enduring great hardships and even meeting Russians there. His opinion paper had been adopted earlier, and Sadanobu had promoted him to construction magistrate. Now this same person was being dispatched again.

However, in the 10th month of that year, a large Russian ship came to Nemuro, escorting three Japanese castaways named Kōtayū, Koichi, and Isokichi, seeking trade and requesting to deliver a state letter and tribute to Edo. The envoy was a man named Adam Laxman, and his party numbered forty-one. So the Matsu-

-mae house urgently reported this matter to the shogunate and requested instructions. The shogunate immediately dispatched Inspector Ishikawa Shōgen Tadafusa, Murakami Daigaku Girei, and Foot Inspector Gotō Jūjirō to Matsumae. These men met with the Russian envoys in Matsumae the following year and told them that in our country, trade with foreign countries is not permitted anywhere except Nagasaki, so they should depart from here promptly. They supplied rice and other provisions and firewood and water, and gave them the following letter of passage before sending them away.

**《Small text: Giving a letter of passage to the Russian envoys》**

Concerning the inspection of one Russian ship proceeding to Nagasaki:
You accept what we have explained and wish to go to Nagasaki. The Christian religion is strictly forbidden in our country. Do not bring any images, vessels, books, or other such items. You will certainly be harmed if you do. If you strictly observe this and reach that place, we will investigate further and may permit you to land.

Kansei 5, 6th month, 27th day

At exactly that time in Edo, there was great commotion over the honorary title incident, with Lords Nakayama and Ōgimachi coming east, but this matter was barely resolved in the 3rd month of that year. However, the month after giving this letter of passage at Matsumae - that is, on the 23rd day of the 7th month - Sadanobu suddenly resigned from his assistant position, as I mentioned before. It was quite turbulent. Meanwhile, Ishikawa Shōgen and others, as I mentioned before, somehow managed to patch things up temporarily, returned in the 12th month, and reported to the shogunate on their meeting with the Russians.

Thus the development of Ezo was again neglected for two or three years. But when those castaways arrived in Edo, Shogun Ienari personally summoned them to the Fukiage horse-viewing pavilion to see them, and had officials question them about the details of their drifting. This apparently served as motivation to learn much about that country's circumstances, and in the 12th month of Kansei 9, the shogunate issued the following order:

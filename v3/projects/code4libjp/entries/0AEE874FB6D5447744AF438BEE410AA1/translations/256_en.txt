Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (National Learning Scholars in Yoshida and Hatano Takao) 486

The most noteworthy point here is that by this time, the so-called "Court-Shogunate Unity Theory" (kōbu gattai ron) was already beginning to sprout among promising young men. This theory appears to have been extensively studied among certain groups at the time. In any case, the young men of Yoshida domain who held such thoughts frequently visited the confinement quarters of Ono Kozan, who was filled with pro-imperial, anti-shogunate ideology based on what was called Southern Court legitimacy theory as I mentioned earlier, and engaged in mutual debates. When I think about this today, I feel an indescribable fascination in recalling those times. Gradually, however, Kozan's opinions influenced the young men of the domain, and after the Sakurada Incident, as the shogunate politics underwent changes, Kozan's confinement was naturally lifted. Though not officially announced, Kozan subsequently began teaching students at the domain school Jishūkan. People like Sekine Rokusaburō, whom I mentioned earlier, who went by the name Chidō, became one of the prominent figures among Kozan's disciples. In this way, Kozan's scholarly style was naturally infused into this land of Yoshida. Combined with the arguments of National Learning scholars that were spreading at the time, this came to inspire a kind of pro-imperial thought not only within the domain but also among certain segments of the townspeople.

**National Learning Scholars in Yoshida**

Regarding National Learning scholars in Yoshida, I touched upon this subject briefly in the previous chapter, but I think I can safely consider Suzuki Tosa as the first such figure. This person, as I mentioned earlier, was a Shinto priest at Hakusan Shrine who was called Yanagi Maro. Born in Kyōhō 16 (1731) and dying in Bunka 14 (1817) at age 87, he entered Motoori Norinaga's school in Tenmei 4 (1784) at age 54, which is clear from Norinaga's disciple registry. He maintained close relationships not only with Norinaga but also with Kamo no Mabuchi and Tanigawa Kotosuga, and the correspondence they exchanged is still preserved by his descendants.

Based on his own writings and other sources, he was quite frugal and diligent, and believed to have devoted himself to charitable work and relief efforts. His son, called Mutsu, also entered Norinaga's school in Kansei 1 (1789). This person's name was Shigeno, born in Meiwa 3 (1766) and died in Tenpō 4 (1833). This person also had close relationships with Ban Nobutomo, Hirata Atsutane, and Kanetane, and it is truly delightful that their correspondence is fortunately preserved in his descendants' house. In essence, both father and son were people of virtuous conduct. Even Ōta Kinshiro, who frequently associated with Mutsu during his residence in Yoshida, recorded the following and presented a poem:

"Since coming to Mikawa, I have associated with about a hundred people, but I am particularly pleased with Suzuki's gentle and honest nature, rarely seen in this world. Being deeply moved and intoxicated by this, I composed a poem to present to him."

From this, we can roughly understand his character. At that time, there were three or four other people in Yoshida who became Norinaga's disciples, as I mentioned in the previous chapter. Subsequently, National Learning in this area generally followed the trend and progressed with an increasingly flourishing tendency. People like Matsudaira Nobuyori became disciples of Ōhira, Norinaga's grandson, along with his concubine Kanai and elderly lady-in-waiting Nakagawa. Of course, at that time, as I mentioned in the previous chapter, there was a person called Nakayama Biseki who served Nobuyori for a long time and was employed considerably among the domain retainers as a professor at Jishūkan. Originally, this person was Ōhira's disciple and held the highest position among his fellow students. Additionally, around this time, an outstanding woman emerged: Iwakami Tohako. This Tohako was originally the daughter of Umame Genkaku, a domain physician serving Lord Inoue of Hamamatsu in Tōtōmi Province. Her childhood name was Ume, and she was born on January 10, An'ei 9 (1780). In December of Kansei 6 (1794), at age 15, she married Iwakami Kyūbei Toshitaka, a retainer of Yoshida domain. Unfortunately, her husband Toshitaka died of illness on September 18, Bunka 4 (1807) at age 37, so Tohako was 28 at the time. She had one daughter and one son, but this son died young, so inevitably...

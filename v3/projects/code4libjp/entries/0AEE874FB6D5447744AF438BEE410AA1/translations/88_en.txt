...was indeed so. Since Nobuo, who was the instigator of the war, had made peace with Hideyoshi, Ieyasu had no connection with either side. Rather than complaining or arguing about the fact that it was fortunate for both sides to become reconciled, he instead had congratulations offered and promptly withdrew his troops and returned to his domain - this is truly worth contemplating and reveals Ieyasu's character.

However, Hideyoshi was also quite shrewd. He immediately sent envoys in pursuit of Ieyasu to Hamamatsu to negotiate peace, and furthermore proposed to adopt Ieyasu's son Ogimaru as his own child, skillfully maneuvering to create a situation where he had effectively conquered Ieyasu.

Yet regarding this matter, Ieyasu calculated one step further ahead. Though he was forced to sacrifice Ogimaru alone, his method of striving to maintain his own power position throughout was perhaps what marks him as a hero among heroes. This point seems to reveal both heroes' characters completely.

Now, regarding this Ogimaru, Hideyoshi had him take the name Hashiba and renamed him Hideyasu, treating him with great favor. However, there was still something unreconciled between the two heroes - Ieyasu would not humble himself to go to Osaka, nor was there any likelihood of Hideyoshi coming to Hamamatsu, and both sides glared at each other with mutual wariness.

During this time, Hideyoshi pacified the Hokuriku, Chūgoku, and Shikoku regions, was appointed kanpaku (regent), and rose to the high rank of junior first court rank. Meanwhile, though Ieyasu faced issues like Sanada Masayuki's resistance in Shinano, he increasingly strengthened his relationship with the Hōjō clan to defend against Hideyoshi. His prestige dominated the Tōkai region and he would not easily submit to Hideyoshi, so Hideyoshi greatly desired to make him submit and seems to have suffered considerably over this. This is something well known to you all without my elaboration, but finally, as a strategy to bring Ieyasu to Osaka, he decided to marry his sister to Ieyasu. On the 22nd day of the 2nd month of Tenshō 14, the envoys Hashiba Takechika and Hijikata Takehisa first came to this Yoshida and met with Sakai Tadatsugu to discuss the matter, then Tadatsugu accompanied them to Hamamatsu...

After thorough discussions, the betrothal was arranged. The bride's procession entered Hamamatsu on April 14th of that year, and on the 11th, Tadatsugu's son Ietsugu went out to meet them at Nishino in Mikawa and received the palanquin. On the 12th they arrived at this Yoshida, and stayed on the 13th, when Tadatsugu entertained the party. The Ietsugu Diary records the following regarding the people who accompanied her and their lodgings:

"12th day, hinoe-uma: The honorable palanquin arrived at Yoshida. At Yoshida, Sake Sama entertained the provincial warriors and retainers from the capital and Owari. Asano Yahyōe and Okudaira Kuhachirō, Tomita Heiemon stayed at Noda-Saigō; Takigawa Kitayū at Shimogata-no-hara; Itō Tarōzaemon at Fukōzu; Goi Oda Gengo-dono; Takigawa Saburōhyōe at Nirengi; Iida Hanbee at Shitara. The ladies stayed with Sake Zaemon. All received gifts of gold and silver workmanship. Lord Itō gave a sword, certificates, and two bundles of Sugihara paper. From our side we presented only a sword and certificates. Lord Itō's lodging was at Toda Samon's place."

At this time, Asano Nagamasa supervised the party. Thus a marriage relationship was established between the Toyotomi and Tokugawa families. However, as Ieyasu still would not easily go to Osaka, Hideyoshi became increasingly anxious and finally had his mother Ōmandokoro go to Okazaki under the pretext of meeting her daughter - essentially as a hostage. Having done this, he further pressed for Ieyasu's appearance, so Ieyasu finally resolved to depart Hamamatsu on October 14th and set out on his first journey to the capital.

At this time, the senior retainers of the Tokugawa house all viewed this with alarm, and some worried that Ieyasu might be assassinated if he entered Osaka. Sakai Tadatsugu appears to have been the strongest opponent of this journey to the capital, and the Mikawa Monogatari contains this account:

"Sakai Saemon-no-jō said: 'This matter of going to the capital is an unavoidable decision, but please reconsider. Even if relations are severed, this journey to the capital is not advisable. Whatever happens, this journey to the capital should absolutely be reconsidered.' When everyone pressed him urgently with these words, Saemon-no-jō and the others..."

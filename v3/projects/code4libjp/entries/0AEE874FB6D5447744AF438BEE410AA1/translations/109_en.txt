He ordered Hidetada to lead about 38,000 hereditary retainers westward via the Tosando route. So on the 24th day of the 8th month, Hidetada had already departed directly from Utsunomiya toward Shinano. With him were Okubo Tadachika, Honda Masanobu, Sakai Ietsugu, Okudaira Iemasa, Suganuma Tadamasa, Makino Yasunobu (Umanosuke), Toda Kazuaki, and many others who had served the Tokugawa clan with distinguished loyalty since the Mikawa days. Sakakibara Yasumasa served as the vanguard commander.

However, as previously mentioned, Ieyasu departed Edo on the 1st day of the 9th month, traveled up the Tokaido, passed through this Yoshida on the 8th day, entered Kiyosu on the 11th, arrived at Akasaka on the 14th, and first planted his golden fan standard at the Okayama camp. But Hidetada was delayed and had not yet arrived.

The reason for this was that, as you know, Sanada Masayuki, lord of Ueda Castle in Shinano, and his second son Yukimura had decided to support the western army, and they held their castle at Ueda to block Hidetada's advance. Certainly, if Hidetada had known of Ieyasu's departure from Edo, he would have advanced by any means necessary, but the messenger bringing news of Ieyasu's departure was delayed by autumn rains and only reached Hidetada on the 9th day. Until then, Hidetada had no news of Ieyasu's situation and spent considerable time besieging Ueda Castle.

I would like to briefly discuss the Sanada clan here. Their earlier relationship when they served the Takeda clan has been mentioned many times before, as you well know, so I will omit it here. Masayuki had two sons, Nobuyuki and Yukimura, and at that time Nobuyuki was at Numata Castle in Joshu.

Now, this Nobuyuki had received considerable favor from the Tokugawa clan, and moreover his wife was Honda Tadakatsu's daughter who had married him as Ieyasu's adopted daughter. Therefore, when Masayuki first received word from Mitsunari about raising an army, he let his two sons choose their allegiance. Nobuyuki requested to join the eastern army while Yukimura wished to join the western army. Masayuki allowed both their wishes, and he himself joined the western army with Yukimura. Thus father and sons, brothers became enemies and allies, but at this time Nobuyuki

belonged to Hidetada and was among the besieging army. Now returning to the story of Ieyasu, as mentioned before, on September 14th Ieyasu arrived at Akasaka and established his camp on Okayama, then gathered his generals for strategic discussions.

At this time, Ikeda Terumasa and Ii Naomasa argued for immediately attacking and capturing Ogaki Castle, while Fukushima Masanori and Honda Tadakatsu argued for first advancing to Osaka to fight a decisive battle with Mori Terumoto and recover the hostages. However, Ieyasu ordered one unit to deal with Ogaki while the main force would advance to destroy Sawayama and head toward Osaka. They immediately began preparations, but that evening there was a small clash between the two armies near the Kabuse River between Ogaki and Akasaka.

In this encounter, the western army achieved what could be called a partial victory. That night, the western army learned of the eastern army's plans and decided they could not ignore this, so they resolved to block them at Sekigahara. This fell completely into Ieyasu's strategic trap, as the eastern army had hoped for this from the beginning. It is said that Ieyasu deliberately let word of his plans leak to the western army.

Thus the western army left Fukuhara Nagataka and 7,500 men at Ogaki Castle, and in the order of Ishida Mitsunari, Shimazu Yoshihiro, Konishi Yukinaga, and Ukita Hideie, they marched toward Sekigahara under cover of night to avoid enemy detection. As you know, Ogaki and Akasaka are separated by only about fifty cho, one located on the Nakasendo and the other on the road leading to Ise, but these two routes converge westward at Tarui.

From there, going slightly west to Sekigahara, the road divides into the Hokuriku Highway and the Nakasendo, making this area a crucial strategic point. Moreover, at Nangū-san south of Tarui, Mori Hidemoto, Chosokabe Morichika, Ankokuji Ekei, Nagatsuka Masaie, and Kikkawa Hiroie were already encamped, and at Matsuo-yama southwest of Sekigahara, Kobayakawa Hideaki was stationed. Mitsunari and his forces arrived at Sekigahara between 1 and 5 AM on the 15th and took position at the junction of the Nakasendo and Hokuriku Highway, with Mitsunari's unit and on the far left wing Shimazu, Konishi, and Ukita...

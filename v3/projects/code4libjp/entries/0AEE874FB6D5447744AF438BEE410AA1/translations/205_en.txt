The order for house arrest was issued on December 18, Tenpō 10, and from that time Kazan came from Edo to his home province and was confined to Tahara. During Kazan's confinement, he frequently came to this Yoshida, and many various anecdotes remain. I have the following story that I heard from an elderly person.

In a certain district of this Yoshida (I believe it was Uomachi or somewhere around Aburaya Seko), there was an eel restaurant whose proprietor was named Katsu. Kazan usually stopped at this house whenever he came to Yoshida. However, this Katsu had an extremely bad relationship with his wife, and there was never a time when they weren't quarreling whenever one visited. So Kazan once said to Katsu that he would write a charm on a plaque for him, and wrote the characters "不争而克勝" (Victory without contention) and gave it to him. He thoroughly explained the meaning of this phrase, and Katsu was apparently moved by it, for from then on the couple stopped quarreling. That plaque was later pawned and lost by Katsu, but I understand it is now preserved at the Takizaki Yasunosuke residence in Uomachi.

**Kazan's Coffered Ceiling**
Also, at Tenjin Shrine in Shinsenmatchi, there remains a coffered ceiling painted by Kazan. This depicts geese with the moon and is of extraordinary quality. A letter accompanies this work, which is truly interesting. This letter was once stored at my relative Satō Ichijūrō's house, so I viewed it many times, but now fortunately it has come to be preserved at Tenjin Shrine. Of course, this too is from the period of confinement in Tahara, and since it reveals Kazan's circumstances at that time and how he frequently traveled to this Yoshida, it is most fascinating and I hope it will be carefully preserved for posterity.

**Kazan's Diary**
Also, at the Asai Jōzō residence in Hanazonomachi is preserved Kazan's handwritten "Mōbu Yūki" (Travel Record of Mōbu). This is a travel diary from when Kazan journeyed from Bushū to Yashū in October of Tenpō 3, and it is truly interesting. Particularly, it records in detail how he unexpectedly became traveling companions with Ikuta Man from the outskirts of Itabashi and shared lodgings at Okegawa inn. It even includes a portrait of Man. When Dr. Mikami of Literature came to Toyohashi some years ago, he viewed this and said it was truly rare, so he explained its significance to me, and I gained much knowledge. This Ikuta Man, as you know...

...was a disciple of Hirata Atsutane, whose name was Dōman, born in Akita. When he heard that the rebellion raised by Ōshio Heihachirō in Osaka during the famine of Tenpō 8 was intended to save the people, he too gathered disciples in Kashiwazaki, Echigo, and on June 10 raised a banner inscribed "Obeying Heaven's Command to Punish National Traitors," attacking government offices and wealthy families, before committing suicide with his wife and children. The actual record of when this man unexpectedly became traveling companions with Kazan on his way to Echigo and first conversed with him, written in Kazan's own hand, is indeed a rare treasure.

Regarding Kazan's travels to this Yoshida during his confinement, I think there would be interesting stories to hear from scholars like Nagao Kayō and Suzuki Baigan, but regrettably I have not yet had the time. I expect there will be opportunities to add supplements later.

Now, to describe the affairs of this period would be quite complex. Since I want to proceed focusing as much as possible on matters related to our city's history, I must abbreviate, but the retired shogun Ienari finally passed away in the intercalary first month of Tenpō 12.

**Ienari's Death**
Thereupon Mizuno Tadakuni finally began implementing his long-held plans. On March 15 of that year, he first dismissed nearly one thousand people, including those who could be called powerful retainers of the western citadel such as Hayashi Higo-no-kami Tadahide, Mizuno Mino-no-kami Tadaatsu, and Minobe Chikuzen-no-kami, as well as Nichiren sect monks who had access to the western citadel's inner quarters, punishing each according to the severity of their cases. He then continued with major reforms and issued orders for frugality. However, because these measures were extremely radical, there was tremendous resentment, and Tadakuni's policies ultimately ended in complete failure.

**Yabe Shunshū's Death by Indignation**
At that time, the aforementioned Yabe Suruga-no-kami Sadakata had transferred from Osaka to become Edo magistrate, and as I briefly mentioned before, he was well-regarded for achieving the proper balance of leniency and strictness. However, because he opposed these reforms as too extreme, he incurred Tadakuni's displeasure and was finally dismissed on December 21 of that year, later placed under custody in Kuwana, Ise, where he died by refusing food in indignation. His replacement as Edo magistrate was the aforementioned Torii Yōzō Tadateru, who during the Kazan and Chōei incident had served as inspector and was quite...

**Biography of Master Kyōkyō**

"I have long enjoyed a friendship with the master that transcends age differences. I have always admired his integrity and kindness, feeling that he is not a person of this modern world. Therefore, I wished to write a biography of him. However, the master is modest by nature and has never boasted about his personal history. Thus it was impossible to know it. Recently I obtained a brief biography written by his disciple Iida Katō Shinitoshi. It records his personal history in considerable detail, so I have revised, supplemented, and compiled it to create this biography."

Who exactly is Master Kyōkyō? This can be understood by seeing the name he chose for himself. The master lived in Edo for a long time and had quite extensive social connections. He ordinarily did not concern himself with appearances and always approached people with sincerity. People immediately respected him upon first meeting. His character was straightforward and passionate, and his concern for the country was extremely deep. When the foreign barbarian incidents arose in past years, he labored in heart and burned with anxiety, unable to forget them for even a moment. After the years of Mizunoto-Ushi and Kinoe-Tora (1853-1854), he worked zealously and urgently, casting aside all other matters, braving dangers and difficulties, constantly forming alliances with like-minded men, or rushing to the gates of those in power, wanting to exhaust his heart and strength to serve the country. Therefore, in serving his daimyo, he performed the duty of direct remonstrance several times. But he was not heeded. When the Fukuyama lord served as attendant to the shogun's council, he presented defensive strategies through one of his retainers. When the Hikone middle captain served in government, he presented plans for handling internal and external affairs through one of his retainers. Sometimes he used alarming words to stir them to action. A friend criticized him for speaking rashly and inappropriately. The master answered: "The situation is urgent. How can there be leisure to choose carefully?" He was closest to Master Fujita Tōko throughout his life, and through him conveyed his intentions to the elderly lord Kageyama. From the lord's family affairs to national internal and external matters, there was nothing he did not point out and discuss. He was also close to Master Yanagawa Seigan, exchanging ideas and corresponding by mail. Through this he wanted to present proposals to the Imperial Court. His friend again warned him about the crime of exceeding his position. The master said: "This is the principle of 'accepting advice through the window.' Moreover, when the country has foreign enemies, it is like one's parents suffering from a severe illness. If one wants to seek a way to save them, why should one worry about minor crimes and punishments?" In the autumn of Mizunoto-Ushi, after reading the shogunate's order criticizing the various domains, he sighed and lamented for several days. A guest who happened to come from Uraga discussed border affairs, and they wept together. Then he composed a poem and presented it, saying: "Bōzan and Sōzan, what [unclear characters]. The dangers of sea barriers were set by Heaven. Moreover, the country's laws and orders are strict. Lords arrange military camps east and west. Recently heard barbarians engage in navigation. Giant ships appear and disappear among three peaks. Increasing troops and guards troubles the court's plans. Hoping to extinguish the evil miasma from the surrounding seas. This year, early in the sixth month of Mizunoto-Ushi. What creatures, these spotted barbarians claiming to be envoys. Receiving them kindly and earnestly reasoning with them, they do not listen. Crossing dangers and passing barriers is especially rude. With letters of profit inducement and威 deterrence. The barbarian feelings are strong while our feelings yield. For a thousand ages the golden bowl gains flaws and cracks. Who in later generations will be able to wash away this disgrace? My friend Chōzō has a heroic and generous nature. He once cast aside his calculating sticks and harbored the ambition to take up the brush. He naturally admires the clever plans of

Genкō's stratagem. He carefully studies martial arts in his leisure time. Upon first hearing of the barbarians' arrival, his hair stood on end with anger. Upon hearing again of the barbarians' departure, his eyes split with rage. What was the purpose of traveling a thousand li south? The situation in the south was known in too much detail. Officials are lazy, generals weak, military forces slack. Mountains bare, waters exhausted, people's strength depleted. There is nothing they won't do to deceive others and themselves. Showing weakness and accepting insults is the worst strategy. This body can be discarded but words can be useful. I directly plan to present strategies and knock at the heavenly gate. The heavenly gate is high and deep, impossible to reach. Wandering and facing the sky, writing 'alas, alas.' Returning dejectedly to visit me. Only seeing words tinged with sorrowful sobbing. Alas, what can be done about the temporary expedient? Making people sigh deeply with pain and resentment this summer, the sixth month." What is called "temporary expedient" uses the language from within the order. Chōzō was from Nihonmatsu, surnamed Nakajima with the literary name Kōzan. He was also said to be a man of noble and outstanding character. In the winter of Hinoto-Mi (1857), the head of the university, Master Hayashi, received shogunal orders to go on a mission to the imperial capital. The master said: "Is this still a time we can hope for?" So he again composed a poem to send him off, saying: "The fourth year of Ansei. The twelfth month of Hinoto-Mi. Master Hayashi received shogunal orders. On an urgent mission to the imperial capital. This embassy is no ordinary post. The matter involves state secrets. I secretly hear talk on the roads. That he will memorialize to decide on barbarian control strategies. If these words prove true. Which patriot can remain silent? Alas, the present situation. Six horses with rotten ropes. Those barbarians have been spying for long. Acting with cunning and craftiness. The court is in endless confusion. Procrastinating and resorting to appeasement. Laughing and fooling the King of Chu. What was Zhang Yi after all? Leading each other to bow to foreign barbarians. All like Qin Hui deserve death. The divine wind has long not risen. The great Way is almost blocked. Unless the great foundation is established. How can we avoid distress? In the past, at the time of Mizunoto-Ushi and Kinoe-Tora. The missed moves are regretted by all. Time does not come again. We look to today for reform. Taking decisive action looking up to the imperial will. Settling the multitude lies in one decision. Waiting for your return with the emperor's reply. Immediately making the realm solemn. Arousing loyal and righteous spirit to wash away the poison of complacency. Using clear retributive justice. Using war-tested defensive strategies. Imperial majesty can be proclaimed. National disgrace can be wiped away. We can defeat barbarian schemes. We can fulfill our ministerial duties. What is at stake is this great. How can you not strive? Though Kan may be dismissed from driving. For three generations [we] have been at your gate. Our humble loyalty hopes to offer water shield. Please forgive [our] insistent directness." Master Hayashi and his associates read this and were deeply moved. The master frequently recited Du Zimei's line about "avoiding people to burn remonstrance drafts," saying "The duty of a minister should be like this." Therefore, none of his various memorials and proposals were kept as drafts. However, by observing the previous two poems, one can know the general outline. His other poems satirizing the world are too numerous to enumerate. When the Bogo Incident prison arose, many renowned scholars throughout the realm were arrested. Regardless of whether the matters were right or wrong, true or false, the authority was violent and cruel beyond description. In the west were people like Yanagawa Seigan, Umeda Unpin, and Rai Mikiki. In the east were people like Fujimori Kōan, Kusakabe Isaji, and Katsuno Hōsaku. All were those with whom the master was intimate. Therefore, all his friends feared for the master. Yet the master still personally ran about and exerted himself, wanting to clear the false charges against these men. Finally, because of this he incurred the guilt of his domain and was exiled, unable to continue living in the capital. The master then undertook a journey to Shinetsu. However, everyone feared the shogunate's authority and worried about being implicated. Therefore, wherever he went he was in poverty and could not stay long. Eventually his domain also induced his return and, considering the contemporary criticism too serious, punished him and confined him in his home province. Officials and soldiers guarded him like a prisoner...

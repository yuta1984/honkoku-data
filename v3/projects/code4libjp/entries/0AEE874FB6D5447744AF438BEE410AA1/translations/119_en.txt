**Toyohashi City Historical Discourse** (The Transfer of Matsudaira Tadatoshi) 212

The only bridges that existed were just these four: Rokugō in Musashi, Yoshida and Yahagi in Mikawa, and Seta in Ōmi. During the Tokugawa period, all four of these great bridges were constructed by the government office and were not the sole financial responsibility of the local lords, making them quite "troublesome" affairs. This great bridge of Yoshida was well-known throughout the realm at the time - just as Nagoya is represented by its castle, Yoshida was represented by its great bridge. Therefore, research into the history of this bridge and considerations regarding its preservation in the future are matters requiring considerable attention, and I believe they have quite deep connections to local history.

However, since I have mentioned this bridge many times before, I think you are generally familiar with its history up to this point. Fortunately, records of each bridge repair during the Tokugawa period remain in the Funamachi district, so I plan to discuss these occasions in detail as we proceed chronologically.

**Record of the Eastern Road** There is also a work called "Record of the Eastern Road" written by Karasumaru Mitsuhiro in Genna 4, which contains the following passage:

"Passing through a place called Ōiwa. There appears to be a great rock on the mountaintop from which the name derives. On the southwestern side of the highway is the great bridge of Yoshida, measuring 98 ken. The castle cannot be seen from outside. Going toward Ōiwa, there are mountains that look like they are wearing painted caps. To the east of those mountains is a mountain that closely resembles Mount Hiei. To the south are smaller versions of Shiga, and to the north smaller versions of Hira."

**Castle Architecture** From this account, it appears that the castle buildings could not be seen from outside during this period. Although the bridge's position at that time was, as I have mentioned before, two or three chō downstream from today's location, even before the Restoration one should have been able to see Yoshida Castle's Nyūdō turret from the bridge. Even today, the army warehouse at the site of the old castle's main bailey can be clearly seen from the bridge, so ultimately, according to this "Record of the Eastern Road," the castle's architecture at that time was quite different from later periods.

**Friendship between Kobori Enshū and Tadatoshi** I would also like to introduce the travel record of Kobori Tōtōmi-no-kami Sōho, which dates from September of Genna 7 and contains the following passage:

"The wind was fierce, so I rode in a palanquin and took a nap. When I awoke and inquired, I found we had reached the village of Yoshida. In my dream I thought how far we had come on this long journey:
Even if a dream, well then, let it be Yoshida village -
Waking to reality is still this sorrowful journey

There was someone I knew at this lodging who spoke at length. The lord of this place is particularly close to me, so I suggested we stop and meet. He said the castle lord was indisposed and heading to Kyoto. We passed that place, crossed the bridge, and arrived at a place called Kozakai."

From this we can see that Kobori Enshū and Tadatoshi had quite a close friendship. This allows us to somewhat imagine what Tadatoshi's daily life was like.

**Relocation of Blacksmith Town** Regarding blacksmith town, fortunately various old documents remain in the Kaji district within our city. Among them is something called "Blacksmith Town Memorandum," a record from around the Enkyō period, which contains the following passage:

"This town consisted of about twenty blacksmith households living in the former blacksmith town. Over 120 years ago, in the Year of the Earth Horse, by order of the castle lord Matsudaira Tonomono-kami, we were commanded to move out to the main street. For this we received assistance rice. Also as a reward, we were granted a market six days per month in this town."

**Former Blacksmith Town** From this it appears that the present blacksmith town was established under Tadatoshi's management. The "former blacksmith town" mentioned refers to present-day Yoshiya district, where blacksmiths were initially gathered and settled in large numbers by Ikeda Terumasa, according to oral tradition and legend. This certainly seems plausible, as Terumasa, as I have mentioned several times before, excavated what is now Hatchō-dōri to expand the samurai residential area, and consequently moved craftsmen like blacksmiths to the outskirts where they were concentrated together. However, when the small hereditary daimyō later came to this area, such large-scale castle fortifications as Terumasa had planned became unnecessary, and

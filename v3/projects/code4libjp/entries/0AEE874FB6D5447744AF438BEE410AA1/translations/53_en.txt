...before that date is the commonly accepted theory, but when we consider it carefully, if this castle siege began on the fourteenth day of the fifth month and was concluded by the twentieth, it seems far too quick. Moreover, Toda Shigesada of Nirengi died in battle at Yoshida on the twelfth day of the eleventh month of Eiroku 7. While some records do not describe this as death in battle, most reliable sources including the "Kansei Chōshū Shokafu" record it as death in battle. Therefore, we must think that this castle siege continued until that time.

Also, regarding the food exchange documents mentioned in the previous chapter, while it is naturally questionable whether they are authentic documents from that time, if we accept them as factual, they date to the second month of Eiroku 8, which means the Imagawa side must have held Yoshida Castle until that time.

One theory states that regarding the surrender of this castle, Toda Tanba-no-kami primarily served as mediator between both sides, but this Tanba-no-kami must refer to Shigesada. Therefore, the conclusion should logically have occurred before Shigesada's death. Of course, this theorist probably does not consider Shigesada's death to be death in battle, but I believe that the mediator for this castle's surrender was not Shigesada but his father Yoshimitsu. As I mentioned earlier, while Yoshimitsu is widely believed to have died in Eiroku 3, he actually lived until Eiroku 11, so it is not unreasonable to say that Yoshimitsu's mediation occurred after Shigesada's death in battle. Considering various other circumstances that I will describe below, I increasingly believe that the Eiroku 8 fifth month theory for this castle's surrender is correct.

**Results of the Battle** Now, regarding the timing of the battle's conclusion as described above, besides Toda Tanba-no-kami, Honda Hikohachirō Tadatsugu and others also advised Shigezane, ultimately leading to the castle's surrender. However, Shigezane had no objection to concluding peace negotiations and surrendering the castle, but he demanded hostages in return. Therefore, the Tokugawa side decided to send Ieyasu's half-brother Matsudaira Genzaburō Katsutoshi and Sakai Tadatsugu's daughter Ofū as hostages to the Imagawa side, and with this...

**Ieyasu Grants Yoshida Castle to Sakai Tadatsugu** ...the matter was settled, the castle completely came under Ieyasu's control, and Ieyasu granted it to Sakai Tadatsugu. However, regarding the document that Ieyasu gave to Tadatsugu when granting him this castle, there are some differences in wording between the version in the "Matsudaira-ki" and that in the "Jisei Motoki," but both are dated the twenty-second day of the sixth month of Eiroku 7 as I mentioned earlier. This would seem to make it unreasonable to date the castle's surrender to Eiroku 8, but in the Sengoku period, it was not uncommon to promise the grant of a castle to a retainer before actually completing its capture, anticipating its fall. Such documents are commonly called "atefumi" (preliminary grants). I believe that the document Ieyasu gave to Tadatsugu at this time, containing phrases like "I have stationed troops throughout the Yoshida area, and when the castle is entered, I will grant new lands," is also of this type. The complete text of the document in the "Matsudaira-ki" is as follows:

"I have ordered the administration of Yoshida and eastern Mikawa. You should provide counsel. I have stationed troops throughout the Yoshida area, and when the castle is entered, I will grant new lands as promised. You should carry out your duties in the mountains as before. Even if there are borrowed debts and such matters, there shall be no objection. Written accordingly.
Eiroku 7, Year of Wood-Rat        Kurandō
Sixth month, 22nd day             Ieyasu
To Sakai Saemon-no-jō-dono"

I must make a correction here: I previously stated that Eiroku 8, fifth month was correct for the timing of Yoshida Castle's surrender, but this was completely my error - it should be Eiroku 8, third month. This theory is found in the "Hankanfu," "Genroku Zuihitsu," "Mikawa Kibun," "Okazaki Koki," "Yoshida Jōshu-kō" and other works, so I ask for your understanding of this matter.

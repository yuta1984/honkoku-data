　　　　　　　they expressed gratitude, then immediately set fire to the magistrate's compound and burned it down, led everyone to Sakurai Temple, left two or three people behind who seemed to be discussing something. Hada Jūzaemon and Uchiumi Tajirō came over, but since I was ill, I had my retainer report this and withdrew. Therefore, I hastily report these rough details. End.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Record of Petition

　　　　　　　1. Recently, a person called former Minister Nakayama from Kyoto, leading many men, burned down the Yamato Gojō magistrate's office and engaged in violence. Afterward, yesterday on the 22nd around the seventh hour of night, claiming to be Nakayama's messenger, forty men in formal dress carrying ten matchlock rifles and ten drawn spears climbed Mount Kōya, requesting lodging. We assigned them two merchant inns and heard their mission's purpose. As shown in the attached copy, they made their demands through formal channels and also stated orally whether we would support the Shogun's house or the Imperial court. If we did not support the Imperial court with our lives, they would immediately burn down the entire mountain, they declared sternly. Depending on our response, they seemed ready to resort to violence immediately. As clergy, we had no immediate recourse and temporarily complied with their demands, but if left as is, their numbers will gradually increase and this could become the source of major disturbance. We humbly request urgent assistance. End.

　　　　　　The Osaka castle deputy was consistently involved in this Totsukawa incident until its suppression, and because of these and other matters, Yoshida domain needed to summon additional troops to prepare for sudden changes, so the home domain frequently conducted such mobilizations. The well-known Yamamoto Hayao responded to this summons and came to Osaka in the fifth month of Bunkyū 3 (1863). Here I would like to briefly describe this Yamamoto Hayao.

　　　　　　Originally, Hayao was a Yoshida domain samurai from a hereditary swordsmanship family. His father was called Kamei Rokuzaemon, who also served Yoshida domain through swordsmanship. Hayao was initially named Kamei Magoroku, with Hayao being his formal name. He was born on December 20th of Bunsei 8 (1825) and had a rather frank and unrestrained character. From his youth he studied national classics under Hatano Takao and was also skilled in waka poetry. When he came to Osaka, he was exactly thirty-nine years old, and at that time he was completely filled with loyalist aspirations. Indeed, judging from letters and other documents of the time, he appears to have been truly a pure and sincere loyalist from the heart, mixing in no political calculations or personal ambitions whatsoever - such were these people. This undoubtedly came from the great influence of his teacher and friend Hatano Takao and others. First, I would like to present below a letter he sent to his relative Kamei Rokurōji in Yoshida while traveling to Osaka under domain orders.

　　　　　　　I respectfully write this letter. Though we are approaching the hot season, I am pleased that you continue in good health and diligent service. As for myself, I traveled without incident and arrived in Osaka on schedule on the 24th, and have been ordered to remain on standby. Also, during my stay there you showed me great kindness and hospitality, for which I am most grateful.

　　　　　　　1. This time I observed the fireflies of the Seta River, went up the Uji River, crossed Kisen Pass to Uji village, visited the famous Uji Bridge, Byōdōin Temple, and the tomb of Asahiyama Usagimichi Masaōji, then came out to Fushimi station intending to also visit the nearby imperial mausoleums, but as it had become around seven o'clock, I rested briefly and arrived in Osaka that night.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　At Fushimi:
　　　　　　　　　　Like bamboo in twilight, even in Fushimi's brief dreams
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　I lament this world we have descended into

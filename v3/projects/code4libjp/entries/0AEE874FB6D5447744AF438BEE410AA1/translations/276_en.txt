Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Supplement: Regarding Hatano Takao) 526

**Main Text:**
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　"I thought not even of my own existence"
　　　　　　　　　　　　When the same person's wife, in extreme poverty, had burned up all the firewood:
　　　　　　　　　"Having burned even the winter-withered eave timbers,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　In the garden there is no time for fallen leaves to accumulate"
　　　　　　　　　　　　Choshu Yoshida Torajiro's death poem:
　　　　　　　　　"Though my body may rot in the fields of Musashi,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Let my spirit and soul remain behind"
　　　　　　　Besides these, I have heard many others, but I will tell you about them when I return home, as I have written many times before. After reading this letter, please pass it on to Haneda Nishijuku Houkyu-kun and others. That is all.
　　　　　　　　(Note) The above letter was sent by Sakaki from Edo to his relative Iida Takebei in Arai, Totomi Province, in Ansei 6 (1859).

　　　　　　　Both the main castle in Edo and the current mansion in Osaka were destroyed by fire - truly the height of lamentation.
　　　　　　　　　　　　Rai Mikki's death poem, which I heard for the first time recently:
　　　　　　　　　　"My sin is evidence that my sincere heart
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Thinking of our sovereign's reign was not deep enough"
　　　　　　　This is truly moving. Together with Umeda Genjiro's:
　　　　　　　　　　"With a heart devoted single-mindedly to our sovereign's reign..."

**Main Text:**
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　"I thought not of my own existence"
　　　　　　　These form a pair of excellent poems that I find deeply moving.
　　　　　　　　(Note) This letter was also sent by Sakaki to Iida Takebei, but the date is unknown.

　　　　　　　(Previous section omitted)
 　　　　　　　First, regarding the Jogen incident, it has failed - this is factual. Choshu's Katsura Kogoro also recently concluded the matter without incident, from which you can understand the situation.
　　　　　　　First, regarding Ohashi's matter, it is completely unclear. It seems there is nothing particularly significant about it.
　　　　　　　I have heard and received the above information.
　　　　　　　The statement of purpose that was ordered from Mr. Kamei the other day refers to the written record left by Uchida Man-nosuke, who came to Nagazawa Matsudaira and then fled to Choshu. Please return the copy of this document as soon as you finish copying it. Written hastily.
　　　　　　　　　　April 20th　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Hatano Hitachi
　　　　　　　　　　　　Mr. Iida Takebei
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　For immediate attention
　　　　　　　　(Note) This letter was sent by Sakaki from his home to Iida Takebei and is likely from Bunkyu 2 (1862). The "Jogen incident" refers to the attack on Senior Councilor Ando Tsushima-no-kami outside the Sakashita Gate. Katsura Kogoro refers to Katsura Kogoro, later known as Kido Takayoshi. Ohashi refers to Ohashi Totsuan (Junzo), who is said to have edited the "Statement of Purpose for Eliminating Traitors" of that time. Uchida Man-nosuke was one of the conspirators in the attack on Senior Councilor Ando and later fled to the Choshu domain residence.

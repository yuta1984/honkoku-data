did not change his principles. However, finally in the eighth year, when Takatenjin Castle was restored to Ieyasu's hands, he was at last able to leave the prison, but due to his long confinement his legs had given out and he could not stand. Regarding this loyalty, it is said that not only Ieyasu but even enemies and allies alike were moved. Now, the story has gone greatly off course, but returning to the beginning, the Ōkōchi family lineage continued from Masaaki through Yukishige, Munetsuna, Sadatsuna, Mitsumasa, and Mitsutsuna as previously mentioned. By Mitsutsuna's time, the Muromachi shogunate had already fallen into decline and the realm was on the verge of chaos, but this man died in battle at Sannōzan in Hazu District on the 18th day of the 7th month of Bunmei 1. His son was Sanetsuna, and his son was Nobumasa. This Nobumasa was initially called Gorosaburo, later Ōkura-shōyū, and is believed to have also used the name Nobitsuna. From this person's era things become somewhat clearer, and his remains still exist in Teratsu, Hazu District. First, the temple called Gikōin in the same village was founded in Eishō 10, originally established by Nobusada, and his grave remains within the temple grounds with "Ōkōchi Ōkura-shōyū Gikōin-den Seigi Daizen-mon" carved on its surface. However, this is quite small and doesn't seem very old, so it's unclear when it was erected. The temple bell also has an inscription recording the brief history of its founding. This too is from a later period, cast during recasting in Bunsei 2, but these all serve as valuable references. Additionally, at the Hachiman shrine in the same village there is a ridge-plate offering donated by Nobumasa on the 12th day of the 4th month of Eishō 10. This also records his name as Nobitsuna. According to Gikōin's death register, this person died on the 22nd day of the 8th month of Eishō 17.

Also around this time, among the Ōkōchi clan was a man called Ōkōchi Bitchū-no-kami Sadatsuna, but his lineage is quite unclear. However, I believe it is certain that he was of the Fusechō Ōkōchi line. That is, the previously mentioned Naganawa Ōkōchi Sadaaki had a second son called Saburōsaemon-jō Sadayasu, and this Sadatsuna was truly his descendant, and what appears as Kaketsuna in the Ōkōchi genealogy

is certainly this person, I believe. During the Eishō era, Shiba Yoshitō of Owari happened to be the protector of Tōtōmi, and the Kira clan had this Sadatsuna stationed at Hamana-shō in Tōtōmi to coordinate with Yoshitō and fight against the forces of Imagawa Ujichika, who was then gradually extending his influence westward. At that time on the Imagawa side, a man called Asahina Bitchū-no-kami Yasuhiro was stationed at Utsuyama castle in Suruga and fought against Sadatsuna and others in the 5th month of Eishō 9, but Sadatsuna was ultimately defeated. However, in the following 10th year, Sadatsuna again gathered troops and attacked the vicinity of the Tenryu River, with considerable violent success. By then Yasuhiro had already died of illness and his son Yasuyoshi was still young, so his uncle Yasumochi was handling military affairs. In Eishō 12, Ujichika himself led troops to attack, and on the 19th day of the 8th month, Sadatsuna was again defeated and died in battle together with his younger brother Komi Shinzaemon Sadamasa. At this time, only Yoshitō surrendered to the Imagawa side, but Ujichika had him shaved and renamed Anshin, sending him back to Owari. This story is quite remarkable, so I have outlined its main points here. Additionally, I would like to mention that around this time among the Naganawa Ōkōchi clan there was also a brave warrior called Ōkōchi Zenbei Masatsuna. This person was the 14th generation descendant of the previously mentioned Ōkōchi Saemon-jō Sadaaki, and his father was called Mototaka (also written as Mototaka). This Mototaka was born in Eishō 12, lived in the previously mentioned Nishi-Naganawa village in Hazu District, and died on the 5th day of the 12th month of Keichō 17 at age 98. In his later years he became a monk and took the name Izumo-no-kami nyūdō Koken, but initially he served under Kira Yoshiaki and participated in battles at Kariya, Ueno, and Tōjō with considerable military achievements, but finally came to serve under Ieyasu. Therefore this Masatsuna also initially served under Kira Yoshiaki, and when Ieyasu attacked Tōjō in Eiroku 4 and 7, Masatsuna's fierce fighting among the Kira forces is quite a famous story. Most sources record that Masatsuna was only 16 years old in Eiroku 4, but since Masatsuna died at age 83 on the 23rd day of the 2nd month of Kan'ei 4, calculating backwards he would have been 17 in Eiroku 4. Later, when Yoshiaki finally requested surrender and left the province, Masatsuna became a hostage to the Tokugawa house.

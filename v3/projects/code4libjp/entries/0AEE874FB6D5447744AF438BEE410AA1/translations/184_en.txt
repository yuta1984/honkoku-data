seeking effective remedies, but it has become extremely difficult to treat. This is truly regrettable and inexcusable.

At that time, they made three requests: first, an audience in Edo; second, letters and gifts; and third, trade and commerce. To reject all three requests entirely would be too harsh, especially since we had given them a letter of passage and they came according to our instructions. For us to break faith in this manner is utterly inexcusable. I must insist on this point. However, since an Edo audience and permanent trade relations are not easily granted, if we cannot permit these, should we not at least accept their letter and provide a reply? (In the early days of our nation, there were many examples of letters being sent to various countries.) If not that, then should the Magistrate of Temples and Shrines send a detailed written explanation of the advantages and disadvantages to their officials? Moreover, since they are a neighboring country, to avoid perpetual discord, we should exhaust our courtesy through lodging, hospitality, gifts, and such to win their goodwill, then frankly explain our unavoidable circumstances and politely decline trade. This is what I submitted in detail.

However, you summoned me to your quarters for deliberation. At that time, the handling was done by Ōi-no-kami-dono, who greatly misjudged the situation, saying that the more politely we treat them, the more they will press their demands, so we should make them angry instead. If they become angry, they won't come again - this was the reasoning given. I strongly disputed this. Admittedly, it was a very urgent matter, so I gathered the Confucian scholars at my residence and divided up various points for submission within one or two evenings. I also stated that for more detailed matters, I should be consulted further and would submit comprehensive details. However, after that, there was no word whatsoever. I began to think that perhaps Ōi-no-kami-dono found my previous arguments disagreeable. After about three months with no word, I could not fathom how things stood, so I approached Uneme-no-shō-dono separately about this matter, but he merely said it was Ōi-no-kami-dono's responsibility to handle directly - just empty words with no substance. Since it became a matter of opposing views, I concluded that no matter how many times I spoke, it would be futile, so I ceased my appeals, etc.

From this, one can clearly understand the state of shogunate deliberations at the time of Rezanov's visit. The "Ōi-no-kami" mentioned in the letter refers to Doi Toshiatsu, and "Uneme-no-shō" refers to Toda Ujinori. Both were senior councilors of the time. Regarding Jussai's

recommendations, what Ōi-no-kami said in response is truly laughably absurd from today's perspective. However, the opinions of most officials at that time were probably all of this nature. This makes Jussai's opinion all the more remarkable as a brilliant insight for the times, truly deserving nothing but admiration. Yet as stated in his letter, it was never accepted by the officials, so Jussai, in his distress, went further to meet with Kondō Kichizaemon of the Inner Secretariat and thoroughly discussed this matter with him, strongly impressing upon him the importance of the issue. This too is recorded in the aforementioned letter, but despite this, Jussai's opinion was never adopted at all.

Moreover, the shogunate's treatment of the Russian envoy at Nagasaki was extremely inappropriate, causing not only the Russian envoy's resentment but also considerable criticism throughout society. Jussai also describes this in his letter, and later goes on to say:

"The farewell greeting at that time, particularly the magistrate's verbal message and the separate document stating they should never return, were laughably absurd. The sea routes belong to all nations of the world. How can we alone block these passages? Is this something we can or cannot do? Speaking in such a manner only makes them more spiteful - this is human nature."

This is truly an irrefutably brilliant argument. From there, Jussai further sharpened his criticism regarding the current incident, beginning with:

"Even now it cannot be undone, but if you do not fully understand these circumstances and exercise proper judgment in the current measures, I fear great mistakes will be repeated once again."

And concluding with:

"Today's matter is truly a most critical opportunity upon which the fate of our nation depends - a time when loyal retainers should risk their lives and use earth clods as pillows."

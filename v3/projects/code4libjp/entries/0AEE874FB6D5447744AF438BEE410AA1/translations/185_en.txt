I humbly believe this to be the case. I have laid bare all my innermost thoughts completely. I hope you will thoroughly devise strategies accordingly. What is regrettable is that if Your Excellency had been in office during the Nagasaki incident years ago, things would not have reached such a state. Even now it is too late to undo what has been done. I can only fear the further mistakes that may follow, etc.

Thus he concludes. There is yet another letter, which also contains discussion of the current incident, so I would like to introduce it below.

"Regarding this current affair, even if peace should eventually be restored, given that we have captured Sakhalin natives, burned down their huts, seized their possessions, and now taken similar measures again, we are already treating them as an enemy nation, making it quite impossible to establish the intended neighborly relations. Yet if we handle this matter too gently, it will show our weakness, and there is no telling how much more their insolent ambitions may grow, etc."

After this argument, he further points out the disadvantageous aspects of our nation's defense in the northern seas, and as a method to address this:

"Military operations naturally prize speed, and even in today's situation, once a reasonable cause is established, victory becomes difficult to achieve if the opportunity is lost. When one acts first, one controls others; when one acts later, one is controlled by others - this is a crucial principle."

These opinions were all in complete accord with Nobuaki's views, and that Nobuaki consistently followed this policy has gradually become evident in actual events.

Now, regarding this incident, when Russian ships first raided the Etorofu and Urup areas, the lords of Nambu, Tsugaru, Matsumae and others all sent urgent messengers to report this to the shogunate. At the shogunate, beginning with Shogun Ienari, they were deeply concerned that this was no ordinary matter and immediately held deliberations in the inner chambers. What has been passed down as part of Nobuaki's opinion at that time was: "Russian ships reconnoitering our northern borders is certainly not a matter of a single day or night. Should they ever establish themselves in Ezo or Sado, that would truly be a national crisis. Therefore, we must first settle the matter concerning Matsumae Wakasa-no-kami

and then order the daimyo of both Oshu provinces to strictly fortify from Tsugaru Sotogahama to Ezo Matsumae. Particularly urgent is dispatching a suitable person from the shogunate to Ezo to serve as inspector." This is also recorded in works such as the "Record of Lord Sugaku's Words and Deeds."

However, the matter concerning Matsumae Wakasa-no-kami requires some explanation - this refers to the famous Matsumae lord's transfer issue. Originally, the previous generation, Akihiro, had been favored by Hitotsubashi Harusato and had attracted attention since Sadanobu's regency, but was ordered into permanent house arrest in March of this year due to his dissolute conduct. The shogunate seized this opportunity to confiscate all of Ezo from the current lord Wakasa-no-kami and establish direct administration - this was the main issue. The shogunate implemented this policy, and in their notification to Wakasa-no-kami stated:

"Although Ezo has been administered by your house since ancient times, due to the difficulty of adequately defending the islands bordering foreign countries, Eastern Ezo was previously ordered to be surrendered and placed under direct government administration. Regarding Western Ezo as well, you have reported that emergency preparations and such cannot be adequately handled within your capabilities, and as the foreign borders are considered a matter of great concern, this time all of Matsumae and Western Ezo are to be confiscated, etc."

The intent is clear from this. As compensation to the Matsumae house, they were given land in Mutsu and Kozuke provinces nominally worth 9,000 koku but actually about 12,000 koku, and the matter was concluded. From then on, the shogunate began direct administration of all of Ezo island. As mentioned previously, initially the "Ezo Magistrate" was established, later changed to "Hakodate Magistrate," but this time it was again changed to "Matsumae Magistrate" to govern all of Ezo island.

Incidentally, Senior Councilor Makino Tadakiyo strongly supported Nobuaki's opinion, and for the Ezo mission, Junior Councilor Hotta Masaatsu was chosen partly because he was fortunately the uncle of Sendai domain lord Date Masachiyo, and Masachiyo was to receive the shogun's daughter Princess Asa in marriage. This too was actually

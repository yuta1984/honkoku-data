...withdrew to Nirengi Castle. However, regarding what the mother was placed in, there is a theory that it was not a long chest but an armor chest (gusoku-hitsu), and indeed the Toda viscount family still preserves that chest today. Perhaps initially she was smuggled out in a long chest and then transferred to an armor chest partway through the escape - this kind of account is also written in a book called "Zatsuwa Hikki" (Miscellaneous Notes).

Also, both the "Mikawa Monogatari" and "Matsudaira-ki" record Toda Tanba-no-kami as the person involved in this incident. Tanba-no-kami would refer to Yoshimitsu, but even if Yoshimitsu was still alive at this time, Shigesada was already the head of the family, so I believe the Shigesada theory is correct.

In any case, having successfully rescued his mother in this manner, Shigesada immediately lit signal fires to report this to the Tokugawa side, and the next day he received from Ieyasu land worth 3,000 kan and a written pledge.

Thus the Tokugawa forces finally surrounded Yoshida Castle and began their attack, but the Imagawa side also sortied from the castle to fight, and on the fourteenth day of the fifth month there was a battle at Shimoji.

**Honda Tadakatsu and Makino Sōjirō** At this time, Ieyasu's general Honda Heihachirō Tadakatsu was still only seventeen years old, but he **crossed spears first** with Makino Sōjirō of the Imagawa side. The "Butoku Hennen Shūsei" and other works record that this Makino Sōjirō was also seventeen years old at this time, but there has long been doubt about this person. The General Staff's "Nihon Senshi Okehazama-eki Hoden" quotes the "Honda-ke Bukō Kikigaki" and under the title "Maki Sōjirō's Aspiration" gives a detailed account of how this Sōjirō was the son of Maki Magozaemon, but hearing of the martial prowess of his father's colleague Kidokoro Sukenosuke, he was inspired and eventually came to cross spears with Honda Tadakatsu in this Battle of Yoshida.

However, according to the "Kansei Chōshū Shokafu" and "Makino-ke Kafu," Yasushige, son of Sadashige who was the ancestor of the Tanabe Makino family, corresponds exactly to this Sōjirō. Originally this Yasushige was born in the same year as Honda Tadakatsu and was staying in Ushikubo with his father at this time, but for this battle he withdrew from Ushikubo and took refuge in Yoshida Castle. Moreover, he was a person of outstanding martial prowess who could fight on equal terms with Tadakatsu.

**Kidokoro Sukenosuke** Kidokoro Sukenosuke was Yasushige's retainer who had once before crossed spears with Tadakatsu at Ushikubo, and at this time they again crossed spears with each other. However, one of Tadakatsu's retainers struck at Sukenosuke's arm from the side, so Yasushige immediately advanced...

...and personally engaged in fierce combat with Tadakatsu, with both receiving wounds. At that time, Yasushige already had the desire to join the Tokugawa side, so he secretly told Tadakatsu of his intention and withdrew. This is the account from the "Kansei Chōshū Shokafu" and other sources as I mentioned before. Yasushige was initially called Sōjirō and Hanemon, and later became Sanuki-no-kami, so while there is a difference in characters between "Sō" and "Sō," based on the period and other circumstances, I believe this Sōjirō who gained first spear honors was the Yasushige I mentioned earlier.

**Hachiya Sadatsugu's Death in Battle** Now at this time, Hachiya Hannosuke Sadatsugu of the Tokugawa side also advanced at the forefront, but since Tadakatsu had gained the honor of first spear, he threw down his spear, drew his sword, and cut into the enemy lines. However, he was shot and wounded by one called Kawai Shōtoku of the Imagawa side. Many records say that Hannosuke died instantly at this time, while others say he returned to camp and died there, but the "Kan'ei-fu" records that he died from his wounds in his hometown village of Mutsuna in Sanshū. He was only twenty-six years old.

**Sadatsugu's Mother** His mother was truly a heroic woman. According to the "Mikawa Monogatari," when news of Hannosuke's death in battle was brought to his mother, she said, "I understand that Hannosuke died in battle, but how did he conduct himself at the end?" When the messenger told her of his incomparable performance, the mother was truly relieved and said, "That makes me truly happy. Death in battle is the way of warriors, so there is no need for regret, but if I heard that Hannosuke's end was poor, there would be no point in my living longer." This truly represents the mothers of warriors of that time.

Besides this, in this battle there were many casualties on both sides, but on the twentieth day of the fifth month, Ieyasu personally took the field and intensified the attack on the castle. Especially the spearpoint of Sakai Saemon-no-jō Tadatsugu, the commander of the vanguard, was quite sharp, and Shigezane finally could no longer hold out.

**The Year and Month of Yoshida Castle's Surrender** However, when this battle was concluded - there is considerable doubt about the year and month. That is, there are already three theories about when this castle was surrendered: this year's fifth month twentieth day, June of the same year, or the fifth month of the following eighth year of Eiroku. However, since documents recording Ieyasu's grant of this castle to Sakai Tadatsugu appear in various books dated the twenty-second day of the sixth month of Eiroku 7, the surrender of this castle was naturally before...

Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (The Imperial Title Incident and Nobuaki) 320

**Main Text:**
In the 9th year, the era name was changed to Kansei, and shortly thereafter arose the famous Imperial Title Incident that you are all familiar with.

Now, this Imperial Title Incident - and it is presumptuous to speak of such matters - involved the then Sacred Emperor Kōkaku, who was the son of Prince Sukehito of the Kan'in Imperial family and had ascended to the throne. Having long wished to honor his father by bestowing upon him the title of Retired Emperor (Daijō Tennō), in the 8th month of Kansei 1 (1789), he first sought to consult the shogunate's opinion. He had the two court nobles Madenokōji Masafusa and Kuga Nobumichi, both serving as court-shogunate liaisons (densō), convey this intention to the Kyoto deputy (shoshidai) Ōta Bitchū-no-kami Sukechika. Indeed, His Majesty had harbored this intention for some time, as evidenced by his having commanded Nakayama Naruchika in the final years of Tenmei to research precedents. Now he had formally communicated this matter to the shogunate through the deputy. Ōta Bitchū-no-kami immediately reported this to the shogunate, but Sadanobu was the first to firmly oppose this matter. While there are various theories about his motivations, and the true reasons cannot easily be determined today, Sadanobu's stated reasoning was as follows: The imperial throne is absolutely sacred, and to bestow the title without having actually occupied the position lacks proper justification. Even if there were historical precedents, they need not necessarily be followed - one should examine the circumstances of the times and the propriety of the matter before deciding. Therefore, he wished the emperor would abandon this intention. If it was from filial piety that he wished to honor his real father, perhaps increasing the father's domain holdings would be more appropriate. Generally speaking, Sadanobu was, as I mentioned before, a person of high character, intelligence, and learning, who had frequently demonstrated loyalty to the imperial house. So this incident was surely not motivated by simple desire to suppress imperial wishes, but as mentioned before, various circumstances...

...compelled him to take the position that this matter must absolutely be stopped. Sadanobu first sent his views privately to Chancellor Takatsukasa Sukehira, and due to these circumstances, the matter was temporarily suspended. However, it was revived in the 2nd month of Kansei 3, and by the 1st month of the following 4th year, the court formally consulted the shogunate, adding private instructions to copies of court deliberations. Given the aforementioned circumstances, the shogunate could not respond immediately and delayed considerably, but finally felt compelled to reply according to their original policy that such a matter was inappropriate. This made the situation quite tense, but the court ultimately decided to temporarily suspend the title discussion, so the shogunate's position prevailed and the matter was settled. However, before this affair completely concluded, the shogunate requested that court-shogunate liaison officials come down to Edo for consultation. This reportedly caused considerable distress to His Majesty, but in the 2nd month of the following year, court nobles Nakayama Naruchika and Ōgimai Kimiaki finally came east. These two nobles, after arriving in Edo, had several discussions with shogunate officials both at Sadanobu's official residence and at the shogun's castle, debating this Imperial Title Incident. At this time, Nobuaki was exactly 31 years old and ranked at the bottom of the senior councilors. During these discussions, when Sadanobu was pressed in argument by Nakayama Naruchika and found himself unable to respond adequately, Nobuaki stepped forward from his junior position to respond. His reasoning was so clear and logical that all listeners were impressed, as recorded in works such as the "Records of Lord Sūgaku's Words and Deeds."

During this Imperial Title Incident, in Kansei 4 there was a change in the Kyoto deputy position - Horita Sagami-no-kami was transferred from Osaka castle keeper to replace Ōta Bitchū-no-kami as Kyoto deputy. When there was a change in the Kyoto deputy position, a senior councilor would always travel from Edo to handle the transition of duties, and this time Nobuaki was assigned this responsibility and traveled to Kyoto...

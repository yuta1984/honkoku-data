　　　　　　　[Continuing the grave inscription] advocating the great cause of imperial reverence, so the shogunal officials despised this and sought to capture him. Perceiving this opportunity, he fled to Yamato, but as the pursuit was extremely urgent, he avoided it and headed to the eastern provinces. Hearing of the Tsukuba uprising, he wished to join it and reached Kōfu, but it had already collapsed. He then turned and went to the Chūgoku region, took refuge between Inaba and Hōki provinces, gathered like-minded patriots and wished to conspire with Chōshū domain, but this was not achieved. Finally he entered the capital and approached Saigō Takamori, the strategist of Satsuma domain, requesting to borrow troops. Takamori said "The time has not yet come, wait a while." The gentleman left in disappointment. Later hearing that Chamberlain Washio was concerned for the country and loved men of talent, he went to meet him. The chamberlain treated him with great favor, and together with Kagawa Keizō, Fujimura Shirō, Tanaka Kensuke, Sakamoto Ryōma, Ōhashi Shinzō and others, they stayed at the Shirakawa residence watching for opportunities. This was because Lord Iwakura was secretly managing the affair. In December of Keiō 3, the chamberlain received secret imperial orders and led Kagawa Keizō and others to raise troops at Mount Kōya, with the gentleman serving as inspector and commander of the Eastern Third Unit. In January of Meiji 1 he returned to the capital, and in April the court ordered him to return to his domain. In intercalary April he was appointed as a recruited scholar to Assistant Judge of the Domestic Affairs Bureau, stationed at Mikawa Province Court, and also became Inspector of Musashi Province. Soon he became attached to the Iwaki Civilian Administration Bureau, in January of the 2nd year was appointed Judge of the Accounting Office Tax Department, in February promoted to Director of the Mining Department, in October became Mining Assistant Director, in November was granted Junior Seventh Rank and concurrently appointed Senior Councilor of Wakamatsu Prefecture. Wakamatsu was the former seat of Aizu domain, and since the Boshin War there had been continuous poor harvests, the samurai and people were displaced, and it was known as difficult to govern. The gentleman approached with both benevolence and authority, and the people's hearts were finally settled. In November of the 3rd year he became full-time Senior Councilor, but the following winter became ill and could not attend to government affairs. When Wakamatsu Prefecture was abolished, he was rewarded with gifts for his achievements. In November of the 5th year he was appointed to Seventh Grade Service in Ishitetsu Prefecture, but in the 6th year his chronic illness recurred and he received treatment in Tokyo. In June he was appointed to service in the Imperial Household Ministry and concurrently served as steward for the three princely houses of Higashifushimi, Yamashina, and Kachō. This was presumably a sinecure granted out of special favor. Before long his illness became increasingly severe, and he died on November 1st of the 7th year. He was born on December 20th of Bunsei 8, living fifty years. He was buried in the Yanaka Tennōji cemetery. His wife was of the Kojima family, and they had one son, Hayatarō, who currently serves as an official at Miyagi Primary Court. The gentleman had an imposing appearance and valued moral principles. From childhood he loved reading national classics, often saying "Born in this country, if one does not know the national polity, how can one distinguish great righteousness and proper relationships?" He also enjoyed waka poetry, composing and reciting when moved by thoughts, often with stirring results. During leisure from official duties he invited scholars to study domestic and foreign political principles, evaluated historical figures, selected the good and adopted the excellent, always determined to put them into personal practice. This is truly admirable. Recently old friends consulted together about erecting a monument at his grave, bringing this account and requesting my composition. I praise the gentleman's aspirations and conduct,序 outline the main points, and conclude with this inscription:

　　　　　　　　Loyal, sincere, righteous, and fierce　　　Early harboring deep concerns　　　The imperial way's revival　　　His long-held aspirations finally fulfilled
　　　　　　　　Had Heaven granted him more years　　　What achievements might he have made　　　To assist the imperial transformation　　　To accomplish distinguished service
　　　　　　　　Ah, his virtuous legacy　　　Inscribed upon this lasting stone　　　Though stone may wear away　　　His virtuous legacy will not perish

　　　　　　　　　　October, Meiji 23 (1890)
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Composed by Count Higashikuze Michitomi, Vice-President of the House of Peers, Junior Second Rank, Order of the Golden Kite First Class

　　　　　　Furthermore, at that time in Osaka there was a martial arts training hall (kōbusho) established for the regular garrison's martial arts practice, and Hayao was one of the supervisors. Of course at that time Hayao was still called Kamei Magoroku, but the supervisor for spear techniques was Nose Tatsuzō, and for sword techniques there were, besides Hayao, Sakabe Daisaku, Mori Kyōsuke, Sakai Shōsuke, Satō Tsunejirō and others. There were also retainers from other domains who served as supervisors, but I think there is no need to mention them all here.

**Nose Tatsuzō**

　　　　　　Among the people mentioned above, those like Nose, Sakabe, and Mori were quite accomplished masters of their arts and people with considerable backgrounds. Therefore I plan to describe their biographies gradually. Now, as you know, following the Totsukawa Incident came the famous Ikuno Silver Mine affair, which was an uprising planned by Hirano Kuniomi with Sawa Nobuyoshi, one of the Seven Nobles who had fled to Chōshū, as the nominal leader. Regarding this, since the Ikuno region was under the jurisdiction of the Osaka Castle Deputy, various reports from related shogunal officials at the time, as well as documents giving instructions about this matter, still remain today as valuable reference materials. However, since I consider that there is very little direct connection to our city's history, I will mention only the above and omit the rest.

**Rising Prices**

　　　　　　Also around that time, prices in Osaka gradually rose, and if this were left unattended, the difficulties of samurai and commoners would be truly severe. So around June of Genji 1 (1864), there are traces of investigating various causes and attempting to regulate the situation. However, since financial knowledge was extremely primitive at the time, there are some rather laughable aspects when viewed from today's perspective, but I think these are rather interesting problems, so if possible I would like to clarify those circumstances at a later date.

**Memorandum Record**

　　　　　　I am considering this. Additionally, regarding affairs during Nobukatsu's time as Osaka Castle Deputy, there are quite complex matters, but among the domain's documents there is one called "Kokorooboe-ki" (Memorandum Record), which records numerous correspondence documents from that time, as well as rumor reports sent from various places and retainers' mission reports. Of course, this alone does not provide complete knowledge of the circumstances of that time, but I think it could serve as one source for historical research, so I would like to briefly introduce this record here as well.

...viewing [the scenery] and having fishing rods brought over, being a harbor, the taste is especially delightful." The writing is extremely brief, but it somehow allows us to glimpse the situation of this area at the time, so I believe this place was already showing considerable prosperity as a harbor by then.

Also, the book called "Ieyasu Diary" (Ietada Diary) that I have mentioned repeatedly records events from the Tenshō era onward, and it contains many accounts of its author, Ietada, coming to Yoshida. Particularly, it includes entries such as "sent people to Yoshida for loan collection office matters." This suggests that Tadatsugu was the leader of eastern Mikawa at that time, and we can infer how this castle served as the stronghold of eastern Mikawa.

**The Sakai Family Genealogy** The above represents the general situation during Tadatsugu's residence at Yoshida Castle, but I believe it necessary to discuss Tadatsugu's genealogy here. Originally, the Sakai family had an extraordinary relationship with the Tokugawa house. However, the Tokugawa family genealogy has long been questionable and cannot be easily resolved. Therefore, the Sakai family genealogy is similarly problematic, but according to traditional accounts, the relationship between these two families is roughly as follows:

The Tokugawa clan originally belonged to the Nitta clan, which descended from Minamoto no Yoshiie. Yoshiie's son Yoshikuni resided in Kōzuke Province and controlled both Nitta and Ashikaga districts. He had two sons, Yoshishige and Yoshiyasu: Yoshishige controlled Nitta district and Yoshiyasu controlled Ashikaga district. These became the ancestors of both the Nitta and Ashikaga clans. Yoshishige had a fourth son named Yoshisue, whose sixth-generation descendant was named Arichika. He was pursued by the Ashikaga and finally came to Mikawa. His sons were Chikaoji and Yasuchika: Chikaoji became an adopted son of the Sakai family and Yasuchika became a son of the Matsudaira family, thus becoming the ancestors of both the Sakai and Matsudaira families. This theory is also recorded in the "Nihon Gaishi."

However, another theory states that Chikaoji was the first to come to Mikawa, initially entering the Sakai family and producing a son named Hirochika, then entering the Matsudaira family and producing a son named Yasuchika. Furthermore, works like the "Hankanfu" present various alternative theories about the Sakai family, and we naturally cannot determine which is accurate.

Regarding Tadatsugu's family line, the "Kansei Chōshū Shokafu" records the following:

Chikaoji's second son:
○Hirochika (Tokutaro, Kogorō) - Ujitada (Kogorō) - Tadakatsu (Kogorō, Saemon-no-jō)
                                  Masachika - ancestor of Utano-kami

Yasutada (Kogorō, Saemon-no-jō) - Tadachika (Saemon-no-jō) - Tadayoshi (Saemon-no-jō)
                                                            Tadatsugu (Koheiji, Kogorō, Saemon-no-jō)

However, this genealogy does not match that of the Sakai Utano-kami family at certain points, and the "Kansei Chōshū Shokafu" acknowledges these discrepancies.

Regarding Tadatsugu's genealogy, this is roughly the situation. Tadatsugu's brother Tadayoshi had a son named Tadanao, who opposed the Tokugawa alliance with the Oda clan after breaking with the Imagawa, eventually rebelling against the Tokugawa and fleeing to Suruga. However, Tadatsugu remained a consistently loyal retainer to the Tokugawa throughout, and because of his brother's family situation, he inherited the family line.

Tadatsugu was born in Taiei 7 and died in Keichō 1, tenth month, at age 70, so he became lord of Yoshida Castle at exactly age 39. While Tadatsugu's military achievements could be discussed extensively, it would be too lengthy to detail them all here, so I plan to discuss subsequent events chronologically in their respective periods. However, I believe it necessary to discuss the families of the various retainers in eastern Mikawa here.

**The Retainers of Eastern Mikawa**

**Toda Tadashige** As I have mentioned repeatedly, Nirengi Castle was located near Yoshida Castle, and the Toda clan of Nirengi subsequently served under the Sakai clan and devoted themselves to the Tokugawa house. The previously mentioned Toda Tonomo-no-suke Shigesada, in the eleventh month of Eiroku 7, at Yoshida Castle town...

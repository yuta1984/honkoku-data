**Interrogation and Punishment of Accomplices**

Those involved included officials from the Temples and Shrines Magistrate, Finance Magistrate, and Great Inspectors and Lesser Inspectors. However, while Itakura Suō-no-kami of the Temples and Shrines Magistrate and Sasaki Shinano-no-kami of the Finance Magistrate held the opinion of judging these matters with as moderate a policy as possible, Town Magistrate Ishiya Inaba-no-kami opposed this, seeking to thoroughly expose their conspiracies and punish those with treasonous hearts.

Great Elder Ii believed that such internal disagreement, if it became known externally, would surely be exploited by Mito domain retainers and others, potentially causing unforeseeable consequences. He ultimately had Izumi-no-kami dismiss both Suō-no-kami and Shinano-no-kami, replacing them with Temples and Shrines Magistrate Matsudaira Hōki-no-kami and Town Magistrate Ikeda Harima-no-kami. Given these circumstances, the investigations became extremely severe, and by the end of April, even Mito senior retainers including Andō Tatewaki, Ōtake Gihee, and Kayane Iyonosuke were subjected to interrogation. Previously, figures including Muraoka, the elderly lady-in-waiting of the Konoe family, and Maki Shikibu-shōyū, house administrator of the Takatsukasa family, had been successively sent east from Kyoto. The court also seemed to recognize the need to censure some court officials simultaneously with the decree postponing foreign expulsion at the end of the previous year, asking the shogunate's private opinion on this matter. As a result, on February 17th of this year, Prince Shōren'in was placed under house confinement, in March the Konoe and Takatsukasa lords withdrew, and on April 22nd the Takatsukasa father and son along with the Konoe and Sanjō lords were permitted to enter Buddhist orders, while Lord Higashibōjō Sōchō was placed under permanent house confinement. With events proceeding thus, on August 27th the shogunate announced the punishment of accomplices. Mito's Nariaki, who could be called the root of this great purge, was ordered to permanent house confinement in Mito, and even distinguished late-Edo diplomats like Iwase Higo-no-kami and Kawaji Saemon-no-jō were affected by the aftermath, being stripped of office and domains and ordered into confinement. This likely resulted from their previous association with the so-called Hitotsubashi faction regarding the heir issue. Among Mito retainers and various rōnin, some faced execution by exposure like Ukai Kōkichi, while others were ordered to commit seppuku or were executed.

were punished, while 53 people were exiled or banished. However, among the leaders of the retainers and rōnin, Umeda Genjirō and Kusakabe Isaji died in prison, and Yanagawa Seigan died of illness just three days before Umeda's arrest. At that time, the shogunate officials arrested and interrogated his wife Kōran. However, as Kōran was a woman of exceptional talent as you know, the officials ultimately could not pursue her further and released her. The Ono Kozan I wish to discuss here was also an accomplice in this great purge and a disciple of Yanagawa Seigan.

**Ono Kozan**

Kozan was originally a village samurai from Takahata village in Higashi-Asai district, Ōmi Province, born in Bunka 11 (1814). His original surname was Yokoyama and his given name was Gen, but later he changed his surname to Ono and his name to Chōgen, with the courtesy name Dōō; Kozan was his literary name. Takahata village was within the branch domain territory of Yoshida domain, where Yoshida domain held about 10,000 koku of land. At that time, a Yoshida domain retainer named Miyawaki Chūzaemon served as district administrator. Kozan loved learning from his youth and initially went to Edo to study under Yanagawa Seigan. His brilliant talent immediately surpassed his peers and he gained recognition. Later he followed Seigan to Kyoto and formed deep relationships with contemporary patriots including Fujimori Kyōsuke. Thus he was ultimately caught up in the Ansei Purge, likely arrested on September 22nd (Ansei 5). This is entirely my conjecture and not certain, but this was the day when numerous patriots including retainers of the Takatsukasa and Ichijō families were arrested in Kyoto. Actually, I had planned to meet Kozan-sensei while he was alive to hear about his experiences, and when going to Kyoto I obtained an introduction from the late Matsui Yuzuru, but Kozan-sensei happened to be away in Chiba Prefecture for the winter, so I reluctantly returned home once.

**Kozan's Confinement**

Later when I went to Kyoto again to visit him, he still had not returned from his winter retreat, so regrettably I returned home again without meeting him. Unexpectedly, Kozan-sensei fell ill while still at his winter retreat and passed away at the age of 97 that April.

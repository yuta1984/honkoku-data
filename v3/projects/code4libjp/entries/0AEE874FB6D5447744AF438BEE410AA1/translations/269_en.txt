**The Incident Outside Sakurada Gate**

There are still many matters regarding the circumstances of Yoshida Domain that I would like to discuss, but in any case, I first intend to provide an overview of the general trends of that era and then gradually delve into the details. Therefore, I shall stop the previous chapter's discussion here and return the conversation to much earlier events, continuing the discussion about the overall situation of that time.

Now, as I previously explained, in the Bogo Persecution, the main so-called loyalist activists were punished, and with the imperial edict postponing the expulsion of foreigners, the court ultimately came to understand the circumstances under which the shogunate signed the treaties, bringing temporary resolution. However, one remaining problem was the matter of the special edict issued to Mito on August 8th. Indeed, while we can respectfully understand that the imperial message sent to Mito Domain arose from the emperor's sacred concern for national affairs, it damaged the shogunate's authority and also contradicted the principle of delegating political authority to the shogunate, making it a serious matter that could not be left unaddressed for the future. Particularly, this special edict was delivered directly to Mito Domain through lowly intermediaries, and Mito Domain, rather than presenting it to the shogunate, secretly accepted it as an honor—this was no ordinary matter. If this were left unchecked, it would naturally become a source of national confusion. Therefore, it seemed that the shogunate's initial opinion was that this imperial edict should naturally be submitted from Mito Domain to the shogunate. Of course, Mito Yoshiatsu initially had the same intention, but as you know, one faction within Mito Domain refused to consent and showed determination to protect the imperial edict with all their might. Consequently, Yoshiatsu's orders could not be carried out, and the shogunate, recognizing that forcing compliance might lead to unpredictable incidents, waited for the right moment and delayed action. However, when the treaty signing issue finally reached a resolution, the shogunate ultimately petitioned the court to have Mito return the imperial edict.

However, at court there was a strong opinion that since this was an edict once graciously issued, having it returned again would be improper. But around February of Ansei 6 (1859), it was apparently decided to somehow have Mito Domain return the edict. However, the intended procedure seemed to be that the court would communicate this through the Kyoto Deputy (Shoshidai), and then the shogunate would convey this message to Mito. Yet the shogunate wanted to handle this matter as peacefully as possible, knowing that if the shogunate became involved, there would certainly be those in Mito Domain who would not obey orders. In such a case, since leniency would be impossible, bloodshed might result. This would be the worst policy for the current situation, so they hoped that the imperial messengers would issue commands directly to Mito Domain through the Deputy without shogunate involvement. Due to such circumstances, this problem made no progress for a while. But in November, after the treatment of Mito lord and retainers as associates of the Bogo incident was decided, the shogunate made further petitions, and ultimately it was arranged that the imperial messengers would communicate through the Deputy to have Mito Domain return the special edict via the shogunate. Thus, on December 15th, Senior Councilor Ii informed Mito Yoshiatsu that the imperial edict should be returned within three days. This became a direct cause of the great incident that followed, and from then on, confusion continued both between Mito Domain and the shogunate and within Mito Domain itself. The progressive and spirited faction, known at the time as the "Tengu group," including young men, finally showed determination to protect the imperial edict even unto death. Thus matters became increasingly complicated, and the turmoil within Mito Domain reached its peak. The imperial edict could not easily be returned through proper procedures. While this situation continued, the Sakurada Incident suddenly erupted. As you all well know, at this time seventeen men led by Sano Takenosuke, who had left Mito Domain, joined by Arimura Jisaemon, a deserter from Satsuma Domain—eighteen warriors in total—ambushed and assassinated Senior Councilor Ii on March 3rd of Man'en 1 (Ansei ended with the sixth year, then the era name changed to Man'en) as he was proceeding to the castle. There are various matters to discuss regarding this incident, but as they are not necessary now, I shall—

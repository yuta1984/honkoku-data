On the eighth day of the third month they camped at Okitsu, and on the eleventh day met with Nobunaga's vanguard commander Nobutada at Kofu in Kai Province. At this time Nobunaga had come as far as Kami-Suwa in Shinano, but ultimately Katsuyori met his pitiful end on that day, and the Takeda clan met their fate of destruction here, which I believe you gentlemen are already aware of. So on the twentieth day Ieyasu traveled to Kami-Suwa to meet with Nobunaga, and when Nobunaga distributed the former Takeda territories among his generals, Ieyasu additionally gained the entire province of Suruga.

⦿The Suicide of Matsudaira Nobuyasu and the Monk Genryū

As I mentioned in the previous chapter, the Takeda clan finally met their destruction on the eleventh day of the third month of Tenshō 10. From then, on the second day of the fourth month Nobunaga departed Suwa in Shinano, entered Kōshū, inspected the aftermath of the Takeda clan's destruction, went to Suruga, toured Mount Fuji, took the Tōkaidō route and returned to Gifu. The Tokugawa clan was thoroughly attentive, repairing the roads along the route and building boat bridges over rivers, paying particular attention to facilities such as temporary encampments and lodgings. Nobunaga lodged at this Yoshida on the seventeenth day of the fourth month during his journey, where Sakai Tadatsugu provided full hospitality, and Nobunaga in return gave Tadatsugu the sword Sanemitsu and two hundred ryō of gold, which is mentioned in various records.

Now this brought to a close the long-standing and irreconcilable relationship with the Takeda clan, so from here we should speak exclusively of the relationship between the Tokugawa clan and the Oda, and later the Toyotomi clan. But here I want to briefly mention the story of Ieyasu's son Nobuyasu's end, which also relates to the story of the monk Hakushū Genryū of Ryūnenji Temple.

As you know, Nobuyasu was Ieyasu's eldest son, born to Ieyasu's wife Lady Sekiguchi. This Lady Sekiguchi was the niece of Imagawa Yoshimoto, being the daughter of Sekiguchi Keibu-shōyū Chikanaga. That is, when Ieyasu was still under the care of the Imagawa family, he took her as wife at Yoshimoto's behest, but even after Ieyasu returned to Mikawa, she remained long in Suruga as a hostage, so when she was later brought to Mikawa

relations between her and Ieyasu did not go well at all. So she was placed at a location called Tsukiyama, which is why she is known to the world as Lady Tsukiyama. Thereafter Lady Sekiguchi's jealousy grew ever stronger, and moreover there were acts of misconduct as recorded in the Matsudaira-ki and other sources. It is even said that she finally conspired with the Takeda clan to kill Ieyasu and install Nobuyasu as ruler. And Nobuyasu too, though a brave and courageous man, repeatedly committed cruel and inhumane acts that caused the people's hearts to turn away from him, as is recorded. However, as befitting a pillar retainer of the Tokugawa clan, Ōkubo Hikozaemon does not clearly record such matters in his Mikawa Monogatari. Nobuyasu's wife was the daughter of Oda Nobunaga, and this woman and Lady Sekiguchi got along very poorly indeed. In contrast, Nobuyasu seemed to serve his mother Lady Sekiguchi well. However, Nobuyasu and his wife also gradually came to have a bad marital relationship. So this wife, the Oda lady, wrote twelve articles of complaint and sent them to her father Nobunaga. This was in the sixth month of Tenshō 7, and this became the cause for Lady Sekiguchi to be killed and for Nobuyasu to ultimately commit suicide. According to the Mikawa Monogatari, the messenger who carried this twelve-article complaint to Nobunaga was Sakai Tadatsugu. At that time Nobunaga read through the letter sent by his daughter and questioned Tadatsugu one by one about the truth or falsehood of each of the first ten articles, and Tadatsugu answered that all were indeed factual. So Nobunaga finally did not need to examine the last two articles, saying that since the family's chief retainer acknowledged each point, there was no longer any doubt, so he should tell Ieyasu to have Nobuyasu commit seppuku, and Tadatsugu is recorded as having accepted this order as well. However, what is recorded in the Matsudaira-ki differs somewhat, so regarding the circumstances of that time it is written as follows:

"Lady of the Third Lord - at that time relations between her and the Third Lord were bad, so she wrote these matters in a document and sent it to her father Nobunaga. First, that he bound and killed a monk at the hawk hunting grounds, also that saying the dancing was poor he shot town dancers with a bow, and other violent behavior, suspicious matters with Ieyasu, speaking beyond what people said, the misconduct of his mother, and also summoning Chinese from the Kōshū side for plotting..."

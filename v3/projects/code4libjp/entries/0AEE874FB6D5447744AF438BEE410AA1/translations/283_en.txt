　　　　　　Others fully understood that foreign commerce was inevitable, but used the expulsion argument as a political strategy to pressure the shogunate. Particularly, there were many who believed that imperial will favored expulsion and thought that loyalty to the emperor meant advocating expulsion, becoming so absorbed in this cause that they had no time to consider other matters. In any case, public opinion at the time was extremely diverse, and not only did the same individual's views change over time, but the meaning of the same words also evolved. When examining the content of these positions, there were undoubtedly several varieties of "revere the emperor, expel the barbarians" arguments. In essence, these expulsion advocates united as a group and pressed the shogunate from all directions using every possible means to implement their policy. The shogun found it impossible to remain in Kyoto and repeatedly requested permission to return to Edo, but was detained by imperial command, creating extremely difficult circumstances.

　　　　　　Such was the situation when another difficult matter arose - the imperial visits to Kamo Shrine and Mount Otoko. The proposal for the Kamo visit originally came from Chōshū domain, but on March 11th it was officially decreed that this would be carried out, and the shogun, who was staying in Kyoto, was also commanded to join the imperial procession. Since this was essentially for prayers regarding expulsion of foreigners, it was truly distressing for the shogun and shogunal councilors, and having the shogun accompany the procession alongside court nobles and other daimyo was problematic given his position. The senior councilors tried to avoid this burden as much as possible, but it proved impossible to decline, and eventually everyone had to join the procession. Then on April 5th, another imperial visit to Mount Otoko was announced. This also arose from Chōshū's scheming, and this time the sequence would involve the emperor personally bestowing a ceremonial sword for expelling foreigners to the shogun before the shrine. The distress of the shogunal government was thus immense. At this time, as you know, there was the Namamugi Incident - the case where Shimazu Hisamitsu, while returning from his mission to Kyoto as deputy envoy, had Englishmen cut down at Namamugi.

　　　　　　The incident had Britain pressing stern demands, and with this and other matters, the shogunate's alarm was all the greater. At this point, Shogun Iemochi finally claimed illness on the day of the Mount Otoko imperial visit (April 11th) and declined to participate in the procession. Yoshinobu, who was to receive the imperial edict in his place, also claimed sudden illness and declined, which further inflamed the attacks on the shogunate among court nobles and activists. With circumstances becoming increasingly urgent in their demands, the shogun finally responded regarding the expulsion deadline on April 20th, declaring that foreign relations would definitely be severed on May 10th - a statement made without real conviction. He sent Yoshinobu east to begin rejection negotiations with foreign countries. At this time, Yoshinobu was relieved of his position as guardian and became commissioner for foreign rejection negotiations. Owari Yoshikatsu was appointed as shogunal assistant, Nabeshima Kansō of Hizen was appointed general supervisor of civil and military affairs, and Sakai Tadatsugu of Himeji received the rank of senior elder. Yoshinobu, considering this advantageous for his own position, departed Kyoto on the 22nd and returned east. The shogun also left Kyoto on the 21st, visited Mount Otoko, and entered Osaka Castle that evening. At this time, Nobuhisa and others of布衣 rank and above, along with those who had arrived earlier, went out to meet him at Kyōbashi gate. Nobuhisa and others immediately entered the castle for an audience. According to the journey to Kyoto diary, it states "The castle commander completed his audience in the corridor before the audience hall," and also:

　　　　　　　　　One ceremonial robe, six　　　　　　　　　Matsudaira Izu-no-kami
　　　　　　　　　　　Bestowed in connection with his service at this post

　　　　　　From there, the shogun boarded a ship to inspect coastal defenses in the Settsu Sea, passed through Sakai, and arrived at Katanoura in Kishū province. On May 11th he returned to Kyoto and reported on the actual conditions of coastal defenses. Around this time, regarding the aforementioned Namamugi Incident, senior councilor Ogasawara Zusho-no-kami Nagayuki conducted repeated negotiations with Britain, but concluded that their demands could not possibly be rejected. The policy was to first provide the compensation they demanded, then proceed with negotiations to reject commercial relations.

Toyohashi City Historical Discourse (Nobuaki's Resignation as Senior Councilor) 326

**Main Text:**
summoned both of them to consult on this matter, but both opposed it. The following day, the shogun again called Sadanobu alone to discuss this matter thoroughly a second time, but Sadanobu still firmly maintained his opposition, and as his tone gradually became more vehement, the shogun finally changed color and reached for the sword at his side. At this time, a member of the inner circle named Hiraoka Yorinaga was nearby, and being quick-witted, he pretended not to understand the situation and said to Sadanobu, "Etchū-no-kami-dono, you are being granted a sword, so please accept it quickly." The shogun had no choice but to throw down the sword he had grasped and retire to his inner chambers. Years later, the shogun also consulted Aoyama Shimotsuke-no-kami Tadahiro on this Ōgosho problem, but he too opposed it.

Given such incidents, this matter alone would create various complications if implemented, making it a serious governmental issue. There is a theory that Sadanobu ultimately had to refuse the Imperial Title Incident as well, given the contrast with this problem. In any case, this was quite a difficult problem at the time, causing much concern among the senior councilors.

**Hisada Nuinosuke**

Originally, this Hitotsubashi Harunari had a chief retainer named Hisada Nuinosuke Nagakō who monopolized Harunari's favor. This man was quite ambitious and had considerable followers. Therefore, in the opinion of Sadanobu and others, if Harunari were granted the title of Ōgosho, this Hisada would naturally wield even greater authority. In this way, the efforts to dismiss Tanuma and reform the accumulated abuses of many years would come to naught with the creation of a second Tanuma, and the work would ultimately dissolve into bubbles, inevitably promoting corruption again.

Therefore, after Sadanobu's retirement, through Nobuaki's planning, the first strategy was to separate this Hisada from Harunari's immediate vicinity, so he was transferred to the position of chief inspector. Particularly before Nobuaki's resignation, the Ni-no-maru (Western Citadel) was being constructed, and the shogun intended to move Harunari there, but Nobuaki absolutely refused to accept this. A satirical verse of the time went:

*A bridge halfway extended to Ni-no-maru*

*What would happen to the shogun if he mistepped?*

It is believed that these were roughly the circumstances that led to Nobuaki's resignation from senior office.

**The Arbitrary Rule of Hisada and Others**

Indeed, after Nobuaki's resignation, Hisada Nagakō conspired with junior councilor Tachibana Izumo-no-kami Tanenori to achieve their private ambitions. Only three years after Nobuaki's resignation in Kyōwa 3, their misconduct was finally exposed, and even the tolerant shogun lost patience. On the 19th day of the 12th month of Bunka 3, both were dismissed from office and ordered into house arrest. However, in the 5th month of the following year 4, Nobuaki was summoned again to assume the position of senior councilor, and was particularly commanded to take the highest seat and control government affairs. This clearly shows the circumstances of that period.

**Hayashi Jussai and Nobuaki**

Nobuaki's resignation was certainly unexpected at the time, and those with aspirations deeply regretted it. The letter that the scholar Hayashi Daigaku-no-kami Jussai sent to Nobuaki at that time still remains in the Ōkōchi family and is considered quite valuable.

Originally, this Hayashi Jussai was the second son of Matsudaira Noto-no-kami Norikazu, lord of Iwamura Castle in Mino Province (a branch of the Ōkyū Matsudaira family). His given name was Kō and his childhood name was Kumazō. When Hayashi Daigaku-no-kami Nobuyoshi died of illness on the 5th day of the 4th month of Kansei 5 without an heir, Jussai succeeded him by special decree of the shogun. However, this was actually due to the recommendation of Sadanobu and others. This person had a cheerful and bold nature, could often surprise people with unexpected actions, and was known for frank speech. He also had genuine sincerity and was quite outstanding in scholarship.

There was exactly a four-year age difference with Nobuaki, with Nobuaki being the elder. The gist of the letter he sent when Nobuaki resigned was roughly as follows:

**Jussai's Letter**

"Your dismissal due to illness this time is truly an unexpected matter. At this time, both court and country, regardless of wise or foolish, feel only grief and regret, but this is ultimately because all society trusts in your normally upright and clear intentions. While your resignation may fulfill your personal wishes, for the nation it is truly an unacceptable matter that can only be lamented. Recently the customs of the world have gradually been declining..."

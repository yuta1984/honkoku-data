...if there were other purposes such as waiting for relief forces or simply holding the enemy here temporarily, it would be quite effective. However, relying solely on castle sieges without any other prospects ultimately amounts to nothing more than sitting and waiting for destruction. As you know, when Kenshin invaded Odawara in the past, and later when Shingen came, the circumstances were completely different from this time. In both cases, the Hōjō clan succeeded with siege tactics, but at those times, needless to say, neither Kenshin nor Shingen had plans for deep penetration into enemy territory. In other words, they had ventured too far, so when the enemy adopted siege tactics, their provisions could not continue and their rear concerns multiplied, making it impossible to remain for long.

This time, Hideyoshi had already subdued almost the entire realm, with only Kantō and Ōu remaining, so he had no rear concerns whatsoever. Moreover, bearing the imperial authority and commanding the great armies of the realm in his advance, his preparations were naturally complete.

Therefore, at this point, there was no possibility that anyone would suddenly exploit Hideyoshi's weaknesses while the Hōjō clan was under siege. If they relied on such possibilities, it would truly be vain hope, ultimately leading to nothing but destruction. This applies not only to military matters but to all worldly affairs, which is why I believe the fascination of historical research is truly infinite.

Now, what might be called a great upheaval following Odawara's fall was the Tokugawa clan's transfer. This was not only a major change for the Tokugawa clan but also marked a great dividing line in the history of our Toyohashi and this region. Namely, as the Tokugawa clan was now transferred from the five provinces of Suruga, Tōtōmi, Mikawa, Kai, and Shinano to the eight provinces of Kantō, all the military commanders I have gradually described in continuing these historical discussions over such a long period would simultaneously lose their connection to this region, giving me the feeling that history itself was being renewed.

Actually, I seem to have omitted mentioning this earlier, but when Ieyasu had gained the two provinces of Kai and Shinano in addition to the three provinces of Suruga, Tōtōmi, and Mikawa, since Hamamatsu was inconvenient as a base, from around the ninth month of Tenshō 14...

...he began preparations to move to Fuchū in Suruga, the former residence of the Imagawa clan. In the same fifteenth year, castle repairs began and were completed around the fifth month, making this the base for the five provinces. However, when Odawara castle finally fell, Hideyoshi enfeoffed Ieyasu with the eight provinces of Kantō, so the Tokugawa clan had to leave their ancestral lands.

This must have greatly troubled the Tokugawa side, as the Mikawa Monogatari records:

"Also, if Ieyasu is to change domains, let him go to Kantō. There is no need for reluctance - whatever is your wish."

When thus commanded, he replied "Most certainly I shall change," and the five provinces of Mikawa, Tōtōmi, Suruga, Kōshū, and Shinano were exchanged for the six provinces of Izu, Sagami, Musashi, Kōzuke, Shimōsa, and Kazusa, and he moved to Kantō in the year of Kōin (1590).

From this, one can see that Hideyoshi's authority at this time was quite formidable. As you know, Oda Nobuo was to exchange Owari and Ise for the Tokugawa clan's former territories of the five provinces Suruga, Tōtōmi, Mikawa, Kai, and Shinano. However, when he expressed dissatisfaction with this, Hideyoshi became angry and immediately confiscated even the five provinces he had promised to give Nobuo, banishing him to Shinano. Given this momentum, it seems likely that Hideyoshi spoke to Ieyasu in terms similar to those recorded in the Mikawa Monogatari.

But that was Ieyasu. He not only cheerfully agreed to the domain transfer but also listened to Hideyoshi's opinion regarding his base and decided on Edo for the first time. Moreover, he proceeded steadily with the domain transfer procedures and promptly handed over his former five provinces, so that even Hideyoshi was amazed by such swiftness. In any case, since all his retainers had to leave their ancestral homeland and take up new territories, the confusion must have been indescribable.

From the records in the Ietada Diary, one can see the situation of that time as if witnessing it directly. Even someone like Ietada, after seeing the suicide of the Hōjō Ujimasa brothers on the eleventh day of the seventh month, headed for Edo on the sixteenth day, arrived on the eighteenth day, but immediately returned to his old domain of Mikawa on the twenty-first day. The record for the twentieth day states...

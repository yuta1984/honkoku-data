which was written by him and has points of reference, but this also follows the first theory. The works belonging to the second theory are "Hankan-fu," "Mikawa Kikigaki," "Yoshida Castle Lords' Records," and certain types of "Mikawa-ki," with "Hankan-fu" also quoting from "Sōgyō-ki." Those taking the third theory are "Ushikubo Secret Discussions" and "Miyajima Biography," and "Yoshida Castle Lords' Study" is also an enthusiastic advocate of the two-wars theory. According to the single-war theory, in this battle the Makino clan was defeated, and Nobushige and many of his kinsmen and retainers died in battle, nearly resulting in complete annihilation. However, according to the two-wars theory, in the earlier battle Shigekazu committed suicide, and later in the subsequent war, many of Nobushige's clan died in defeat. From this perspective, the two-wars theory seems plausible, but here lies the reason why the first theory - the Kyōroku 2 theory - is powerful: the famous Jōkyō submissions. Among the submissions by Atsumi Tarōzaemon, Ōoka Chūshirō, Kobayashi Sōbei and others, there are sections describing their ancestors' achievements, all of which date this battle to Kyōroku 2. Particularly in Sano Yohachirō's submission, it states that a Yohachirō from five generations prior was the first spear in this battle, striking Makino Denzō and Denji with his spear, and having their heads taken by Shibata Nakatsuasa and Ōoka Chūemon, etc. Similarly, Ōoka Chūshirō's submission also records that Chūemon from five generations prior killed Denji. Additionally, Ishikawa Tononokami's submission also records that Shibata Nakatsuasa killed Makino Denzō. Thus, the deaths in battle of Denzō, Denji and other Makino clan members in Kyōroku 2 appear immovable. However, what could serve as counter-evidence is that there was a retainer of the Tanabe-Makino family named Furukawa Shōtsū, who lived in Furukawa village, Hōi District (near present-day Ōmura) and was from a distinguished family. During this fall of Yoshida Castle, he rescued Sadashige, the ancestor of the Tanabe-Makino family, when he fled wounded, and through this connection eventually served as his retainer. This family continues unbroken to this day, and they preserve something called the "Furukawa Genealogy." This is worth consulting as reference, but this genealogy dates this battle to Tenbun 1. However, since the records preserved by most families are predominantly of the single-war theory of Kyōroku 2, I believe we ultimately have no choice but to follow this theory.

Situation of the Battle
Now regarding the circumstances of this battle, fortunately it is detailed in Ōkubo Hikozaemon's "Mikawa Monogatari," so I think we can clarify the general situation. Although this tale gives no year, month or day, it records the battle only once. According to this tale, Kiyoyasu first departed Okazaki and took position at Akasaka, with his vanguard setting up camp at Goyu and Kōfu. At dawn, he departed Akasaka, raised his banner at Kosakai, and his vanguard set fire to Shimoji. Seeing this, the Makino forces, with fierce determination to decide the outcome here, crossed the Toyokawa river, landed on the opposite bank, pushed away all the boats and formed what is called a "back-to-the-water formation." Kiyoyasu then advanced from Kosakai and clashed at the embankment of Shimoji, with both sides contending to capture this embankment. "Mikawa Monogatari" records this scene:
　"Kiyoyasu tried to push up onto the Shimoji embankment. Denzō also tried to push up onto the embankment. Both sides clung to either side of the embankment for about half a day, with only the sound of nembutsu prayers, taking the matter seriously and calming their hearts in deep silence."
Is this not a record of infinite interest for understanding the state of warfare in this era? Kiyoyasu, not heeding his retainers' counsel, personally charged into the enemy lines together with Matsudaira Naizen Nobusada, but the Makino forces' momentum was fierce and Kiyoyasu's side was temporarily defeated. However, they counterattacked again and finally pushed the Makino forces back to the river, where Nobushige and nearly all of the Makino clan died in battle. Indeed, Kiyoyasu's side also suffered considerable damage, as according to the Jōkyō submissions, a considerable number of people died in battle. "Mikawa Monogatari" also describes the circumstances when Denzō and others were killed:
　"The four brothers Denzō, Denji, Shinzō, and Shinji were killed. The ladies in Yoshida Castle came out to watch, saying 'Come out to see what's happening at Shimoji,' and wearing 'kongō' (iron clogs), they came out and looked over the fence. Kiyoyasu, having won the battle as he wished, went around to the upper rapids of Yoshida River, rode across the river and immediately attacked Yoshida Castle, whereupon the ladies, wearing their 'kongō,' fled to Tahara."
I believe that the description of the ladies in the castle wearing "kongō" and fleeing to Tahara truly represents the conditions of that time.

**Takashima Shuhan**
He built reverberatory furnaces and devoted himself to the manufacture of guns and cannons. Originally, this Takashima Shuhan was formerly a Nagasaki magistrate who had long studied the most advanced Western-style gunnery from the Dutch, eventually establishing a school called the Takashima-ryu. In the final years of Tenpō, his techniques were once about to be adopted by the shogunate. However, since the conservative faction still held strong influence at that time, he fell victim to the machinations of the Torii Kai-no-kami faction and was banished in the seventh month of Kōka 3, being placed under permanent custody of Abe Toranosuke. Now, through the efforts of his disciple Egawa, he was pardoned (in the eighth month of Kaei 6) and became an instructor in gunnery. The following year, in the seventh month of Ansei 1, there were also various advisements from the Dutch regarding our naval construction.

**Kanko-maru**
A year later, that country presented our nation with a steamship, which was the famous Kanko-maru. The shogunate immediately sent promising young men including Katsu Rintarō to Nagasaki to receive instruction from the Dutch in shipbuilding, navigation, gunnery, and other subjects. This became the beginning of our country's naval establishment.

**Kōbusho (Military Arts Academy)**
Simultaneously, the shogunate also decided to greatly encourage martial arts to boost morale, establishing military academies at three locations in Edo - Tsukiji, Sujichigai-soto, and Yotsuya - in the second month of Ansei 2, implementing this from the fourth month of the third year. The shogunate also recognized the need for military system reform and had previously entrusted this matter to Mito Nariaki. However, since that matter had not progressed sufficiently, when establishing these military academies, at Nariaki's initiative the project was transferred to the academies, and commanders Kugai Inaba-no-kami and Ikeda Kai-no-kami were ordered to investigate this matter.

Under such circumstances, envoys from America, Britain, and Russia arrived in succession, and as a result of this impact, Western learning in coastal defense, shipbuilding, gunnery and other fields began to be actively adopted in some quarters as described above. However, this had not yet spread to the general population, so there were indeed remarkable differences in the thinking of our countrymen at that time. Therefore, I would like to describe a bit more about what the situation in our Yoshida domain was like at that time.

**Hikosaka Kikusaku**
Now I would like to talk a bit about Western scholars in this Yoshida. At that time, there was a great mathematician named Hikosaka Kikusaku living in Shinsen-machi in Yoshida. His father was called Hikosaka Kihei, who unusually for a townsman was skilled in waka poetry, with the given name Chizen and pen name Sugisono. Kikusaku was born in Kyōwa 3, with the given name Noriyo shi, courtesy name Tokumoto, and pen name Narimichi. From childhood he was rich in rational thinking and studied mathematics under Makino Denzō from Muro village. Later he went to Edo and entered the school of Uchida Kansai (Yatarō), studying astronomy, geography, surveying, calendar calculation, and of course natural philosophy, mastering their profound principles, while also reading Dutch books.

This Uchida Kansai lived within the estate of the aforementioned Egawa Tarō-zaemon in Shinsen-za, Shiba at that time. The letters he sent to Kikusaku contain truly interesting material for understanding the circumstances of that time. Fortunately these survive in his descendants' house and are being collected into the city historical materials.

In Ansei 4, Kikusaku was first summoned by Yoshida domain and enrolled among the samurai class, being appointed as mathematics instructor at the domain school. As you know, the irrigation method for Yoshida-gata-mura that this man devised was quite advanced - at that time, under orders from the domain and after consulting with his teacher Uchida Kansai, he attempted to apply Western natural philosophy to create an eclectic water pump to improve irrigation. The documents for this project also remain in his family house and can be viewed today, making them quite interesting.

This man lived to age 77, dying of illness in this place on January 28, Meiji 12. Those who entered his school and received instruction numbered in the hundreds, so his contribution to early introduction of Western natural philosophy to our region was indeed considerable. His monument is in the grounds of Ryūnen-ji temple, with the inscription composed by Ishikawa Kōsai. Also, among the mathematical works he researched were many truly valuable references, so recently the well-known Endō Toshisada from the Academy of Sciences for research into the history of Japanese mathematics...

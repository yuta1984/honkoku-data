　　　　　　Toyohashi Historical Discussion
　　　　　　　　　This municipal historical discussion consists of lectures specially given by Toyohashi Mayor Ōguchi Kiroku for this newspaper, which have been transcribed, strictly revised by the same gentleman, and published to be widely
　　　　　　　　　distributed to our newspaper's subscribers.
　　　　　　　 Regarding the Toyohashi municipal history that I have been researching as a recent municipal project, there are many people who wish to have
　　　　　　　 even a portion of it published, and there have already been such requests from certain newspaper reporters in various places. However, since it is still under investigation, the time is not yet
　　　　　　　ripe for making it public, and I have been hesitant about this. But as the investigation gradually progresses, I now believe that even though it is still a draft, it would be
　　　　　　　 beneficial to publish it and seek the opinions and teachings of knowledgeable people throughout the world, so I have decided to gradually
　　　　　　　 share only what I believe to be true.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　⦿Toyohashi before castle construction
　　　　　　　 The land of Toyohashi was formerly called Yoshida, and it was renamed to the present Toyohashi in the second year of Meiji. Before Yoshida,
　　　　　　　it was called Imahashi. It is also a clear fact that there was a place name called Akumi even before that. In this region, there are
　　　　　　　   shell mounds, Stone Age ruins, and numerous ancient tombs from which many artifacts have been discovered, indicating that people related to these artifacts were already
　　　　　　　　living here in very ancient times. However, since I believe this research belongs to the field of so-called archaeology, I will not include it in
　　　　　　　　this investigation. Therefore, I believe that the oldest reliable written record of this region's affairs is found in the Daijōkan-fu (Grand Council of State decree) recorded in the
《Marginal note: First written｜record of Toyo》　　　　'Ruijū Sandai-kyaku' (Classified Collection of Decrees from Three Reigns). This book contains the 'Kōnin-kyaku' in ten volumes compiled by Fujiwara
《Marginal note: hashi》　　　　　　　 Fuyutsugu and others by imperial command, the 'Jōgan-kyaku' in twelve volumes compiled by imperial command by Fujiwara Ujimune and others, and works compiled by imperial command by Fujiwara Tokihira and others

1. Around the same time, Lord Ieyasu's (Gongensama) opinion was: "Laws should be established like fire - that is good. When established like water, they harm people. Fire burns fiercely and roughly, so people are cautious beforehand and do not burn to death. Water appears calm on the surface but is deep below, so people become careless and die when the crucial moment comes.

Wait a little - I too will achieve distinction," and he rode back. Fortunately, he soon struck down an enemy, took the head, and they returned together to present it before [Ieyasu].

1. When Yonezu Seizaemon was appointed to the Sakai magistrate's office, there was an arrest to be made at Seizaemon's location. Gongensama said "Have you arrested him yet? Go and see," and sent Ochiai Koheita as a messenger

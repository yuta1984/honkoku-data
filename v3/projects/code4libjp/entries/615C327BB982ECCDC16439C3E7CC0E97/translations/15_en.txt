1. When retreating through mountains at night, there is a method called "cut matchcord" to deceive the enemy. Cut matchcord to about one inch, light it, and place it in tree branches at turns or elevated spots. The enemy will think [our forces] are still holding position and will hesitate to approach, allowing our forces to retreat safely.

1. When attacking enemy territory and taking positions, one should carefully observe main roads and escape routes everywhere, install palisades, and cut trenches. This is preparation against night attacks.

1. When fighting mounted warriors, one should cut or shoot the horse. Strike when the horse rears and the rider falls - so it was related.

1. When our forces are routed, one must not stay on the main road. Withdraw to the sides and stay in elevated places, as people will be watching.

1. Soybeans should be prepared like dried rice and carried in military pouches. They are good for feeding both men and horses, as Kichiuemon said.

1. A general should be cautious when: leaving his home castle for one day and night, or for three nights; entering enemy territory; and when departing from forward enemy positions. This is because those lying in ambush can easily deploy forces. Generally, areas around castles and escape routes are important tactical locations.

1. An enemy with military forces will raise banners, deploy foot soldiers, post lookouts, position themselves near the banners, and keep horses grouped to one side. When they are heavily prepared and completely quiet, this should be understood as serious - it is a proper formation. When banner units are moving and troops are restlessly making various disturbances, this should be understood as manageable.

1. In Fujita Sukebei's account, a man named Sugihara Tsune, depending on how he deployed foot soldiers, engaged fifty or one hundred [enemies]. For example, if there were fifty foot soldiers, he would divide them into two groups of twenty-five each. When twenty-five men charged up, he would observe carefully, draw the enemy in, give commands to avoid wasted arrows, have them shoot, then begin attacking again.

[Ieyasu] struck a bell with that sword of his. "There may be laws about receiving punishment for [striking] this bell, but I will not mention that place," he said, and broke and discarded the short sword. Fukaya Seijiūrō picked up the handle of that short sword, which was spoken of unfavorably.

1. At that time [Ieyasu] said, "Generally, when positioning forces near castle walls, one should place forest or thickets at the back, or position on mountains or high ground."

1. At that time, while conducting reconnaissance, he went down along the Sakawa River and sat at the water's edge by the seashore to observe the interior of the castle before returning. He scolded the retainers who followed behind and rode directly past the castle walls. "Those who pass near castle walls are the most likely, should [the enemy] sally forth from the castle, to die in battle on the spot. It would be unseemly to flee, and if they are killed, it would boost the castle's morale - these fools do not understand this," he scolded them. "The proper way to observe a castle is to ride around from the perimeter and view it from the side," he declared.

1. At that time, Suwanohara was the main camp. While he went out for reconnaissance, [he ordered] "Each of you remain here and establish positions," leaving behind Naitō Shirōzaemon, Umanushi Mizu, Watari Tadauemon, Kakehi Sukedayū, and Hattori Hanzō respectively, and took along five or six young retainers. When he returned and inspected the camp quarters, he summoned everyone and scolded them repeatedly: "What an ignorant way to position the camp! I thought you would all understand, but you are all beginners," and scolded them. When everyone began repositioning the camp, they ended up back-to-front, initially positioning to face toward the castle. His opinion was: "This way you will be surrounded. [The enemy] will not sally forth from the castle to fight. If they have such intentions, they would advance from the mountains in whichever direction. Being quickly surrounded like this, the castle's only recourse is night attacks. They will launch night attacks before the camp positions are settled. They will not fight when sallying from the castle. Since each direction has local guides, they can hide anywhere and break through from behind the camp formations to return to the castle - that is how they conduct night attacks. With precisely this understanding, one should construct camps near castle walls with the rear as the primary concern," he said as he scolded them.

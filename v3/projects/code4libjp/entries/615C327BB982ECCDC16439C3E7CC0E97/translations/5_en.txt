1. Yamamoto Kansuke said that it is good for castles to have many entrances (koguchi), as Sagami reported at the same time. If there are many entrances, to prevent attackers from cutting their way out from within the castle, troops are stationed in layers at the entrances. At all times, this serves the same purpose of exhausting the enemy's forces.

1. The same person spoke and recounted: If entrances and town gates are straight, the enemy can push through and see all the way to the rear, making it difficult to rally the troops and mount a counterattack. If they are curved, the attacking enemy cannot understand the turns and will also fear flanking shots, so they will not push in so far. Always counterattack at the turns. However, if there are too many turns, when retreating, allies may have their spears stepped on and knocked down.

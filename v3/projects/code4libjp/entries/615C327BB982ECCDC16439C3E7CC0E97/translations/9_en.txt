The troops would become demoralized, as people of old used to say.

《Note: Tamon construction》【written in red ink in the upper section】
1. Tamon construction in castles is extremely bad. During siege defense, even those with helmet visors find them covered and oppressive, as Honda Chūsho recounted in his tale.
During the siege of Shiga Castle, when three or four matchlocks were fired inside the tamon construction, it became dark with smoke and unbearable, as Kobori Shinsuke recounted.

《Note: Waist rations》【written in red ink in the upper section】
1. For combat, dried rice is good. Make cotton combat pouches with openings, and when needed, put dried rice in them and attach to the waist - since you chew it finely, it works well. Also, if you put the pouch as-is into water and leave it briefly, it softens and becomes like cooked rice, as Kichiuemon recounted.

1. Grind the flesh of pickled plums, wrap in silk, attach string and carry it - sugar is also good, the same person said.

1. During the retreat from Izu (Nirayama), at the moment of crisis, Ōkubo Jirōuemon led the banner guards while Naitō Shirōzaemon served as spear magistrate. When the enemy pressed hard and [Ieyasu] retreated in three directions - Saemon-no-jō (Ōkubo Jirōuemon) leading troops in one direction, Shichirōuemon accompanying the banner with troops in another direction, and his lordship retreating in a third direction - the assignment of banner guard duties to Naitō Shirōzaemon and spear magistrate duties to Ōkubo Jirōuemon must surely have been deliberate planning, as everyone discussed among themselves.

1. When laying out the rope boundaries for Odawara Castle: "Castles should simply be designed for easy retreat and to prevent enemy penetration - castles should be built defensively."

1. Lateral shooting positions were specially arranged in a rotating manner for the rope boundary layout.

《Note: Formations near castle walls》【written in red ink in the upper section】
1. During the Odawara campaign, when Lord Ii Hyōbu-shōyū Naomasa was dispatched with troops toward the Sakawa River area, [Ieyasu] ordered: "Position the troops with the forest at their back." However, when Hyōbu positioned his formation on the riverbank, [Ieyasu] became extremely angry, saying: "Generally, when forming up near castle walls, one should position with forest or thickets at the back to prevent the enemy from seeing the extent of one's forces. I cannot understand forming up in a place where the enemy can see through the forest right down to counting individual soldiers in the formation." When [Ieyasu] became angry, Hyōbu replied, "It was your command, so I positioned [the troops] in that location." At this, [Ieyasu] drew his short sword while mounted on his horse—

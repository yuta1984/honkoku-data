They create internal discord by speaking divisively, causing mutual suspicion and countless worries that lead to breakdown. Also, infiltration occurs when the enemy uses some stratagem to draw out castle defenders, appearing weak to lure them into a trap. When they send out one person to strike down what seems like a ploy, others rush out saying they won't be outdone, but then they cannot withdraw their forces in time, allowing enemy infiltration into the castle. These three points should be well understood. As this was always Gongensama's intention, everyone should understand well.

In a related story, when Shingen's Kōshū troops were transporting supplies along the beach in front of Kambara Castle in Suruga, the castle garrison sallied forth to drive them off and capture them. Shingen then had earth bags or grass bundles made to look like baggage, sent them along the same beach route, and placed hidden troops in the mountains before and behind the castle. When this fake baggage train passed and the castle defenders all came out to drive them off and capture them, since those accompanying the supply train offered only light resistance, the castle opened up and everyone came out. At that moment, war cries arose from front and rear as the hidden troops attacked, and the castle was taken immediately. This was a story told by Yonekura Tango.

When the castle defenders competed with each other in sallying forth, he deliberately appeared weak to draw them in, giving orders that not a single man should engage seriously. By feigning defeat to this extent, when the castle troops came out, he immediately counterattacked and infiltrated to capture it. This was a story told by Niimi Hikoemon.

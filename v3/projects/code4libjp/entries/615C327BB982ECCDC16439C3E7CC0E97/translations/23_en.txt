At Koyama, when making a strategic withdrawal by wheeling north, they engaged the enemy with fierce attacks while retreating. Until then, Saburō-sama had been retreating at the vanguard. When retreating from Tanaka with the enemy at their rear, Saburō-sama held back his horse and said "Gongensama should retreat first," but father and son courteously declined for a long time and would not retreat.

They say that if latrines are not emptied frequently, there will be nowhere to dispose of waste later, causing great inconvenience.

《Swordsmen》
1. There was a practitioner of military arts called Kodachi Hanshichi. He carried an iron fan and with it conducted matches and discussions of military strategy, distinguishing himself many times. When Taitokuin-sama inquired of his disciple, he replied: "There is nothing special about it - the secret is to engage in matches thinking it uninteresting and boring." This greatly impressed [Taitokuin-sama]. In matches as well as in actual combat, if one's mind is captivated by thoughts of it being interesting, there is nothing to fear, and strategies emerge without confusion - this accords with what the ancients said. In quarrels or sudden minor incidents, people become confused, making their responses slow and their techniques dull, as everyone says.

《Daily Mental Preparation》
1. Generally speaking, one should always assess locations wherever one may be - even in a sitting room, constantly thinking "if something happens, I'll do this and that." If one maintains this attitude regularly, one can respond quickly, as the old veterans tell us.

《Ground of Life and Ground of Death》
1. For humans, entering the ground of death is paramount. Generally, there are two kinds: ground of life and ground of death. Ground of life means wanting to live; ground of death means being resolved to die. Those who commit seppuku or great generals, when it comes to the end, have nothing wrong with them. This is because they enter the ground of death and are completely resolved. Since ancient times, desperate battles with odds of ten deaths to one life are fought well and surely won. Desperate battles without sufficient troops or strategy will surely be lost. It's the same as the saying "a cornered rat will bite the cat." Great generals not only consider themselves but also encourage and admonish their soldiers, leading them into the ground of death, thus achieving final deeds of valor. Even recommending and ensuring completion of service that would not normally be achievable has the same meaning.

《Ground of Death in Surprise Attacks》
1. When unexpectedly planning to assault a castle or suddenly engage in battle, consider the enemy's meal times - dawn attacks and evening attacks. Our side should prepare thoroughly and attack before the enemy has eaten. These times are: early morning (hour of the Rabbit), early evening (hour of the Monkey), and at night during the hours of the Rat and Ox.

《Spear Handling in Combat》
1. In combat, spears should be held vertically on the shoulder, ready to strike immediately as needed.

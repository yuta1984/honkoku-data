1. As something Gongensama said, this is a story from Abe Bitchū-dono. People especially rely on hereditary retainers for service. Those who come from outside serve well and fulfill their duties. When serving a lord, the hereditary retainers become dissatisfied, thinking they are losing out to newcomers, and neglect their service, running about day and night. Later they go elsewhere, and since they cannot be pampered as they were in their own house, they return and serve at that time, but it is already too late and there can be no harmony between lord and retainer. If hereditary retainers serve with an easy heart and proper dedication, why would they be replaced by outsiders? Serve with proper understanding - this was said to everyone.

1. Think of service to your lord as "one knot" [one generation's duty], he said. Grandfather served his lord for the sake of his position at that time, parent serves the parent's lord, child serves the child's lord - each is one knot. Do not take pride in your parents' and grandparents' service while neglecting service in your own generation, nor harbor thoughts of succeeding to military achievements you yourself have not performed - this was his teaching.

《The Three Precepts for Warriors》
1. Retainers have three precepts: [First,] leaking what your lord says to others - for example, even if you hear that your parent is to be punished, if you tell me about it, I will resent you even from beyond the grave. Second is gambling and mediating among fellow samurai - this has no place in a samurai's heart. Third is, no matter how you are employed, thinking your fate is unfortunate and harboring resentment toward your lord - such things were taught.

1. Once when accompanying [the lord] to Suruga, he said: "If you sleep at the inn after leaving Edo, you will be useless for service. Even when in the palace, there are times when you cannot serve due to just a paper screen barrier - this has been the case since ancient times. Think especially when traveling that you must not leave your lord's side."

1. Kenshin constantly said: "I learn military arts from Yoshitsune. People listen to dance and Heike tales as old stories, so they are of no use to themselves. I listen to the parts about Yoshitsune's military exploits by applying them to myself - I compare them to my own situation." Someone told this story, saying that truly in that gathering, he would relate everything to his own way and weapons. Those skilled in judgment listen for those aspects, while those skilled in poetry listen to the flow of words. Such things also for the future...

Prior to this, Yasunaga was granted the Matsudaira surname and married to Ieyasu's half-sister from the Hisamatsu clan, but later repeatedly distinguished himself in military service for the Tokugawa clan, and in Tensho 18 (1590), simultaneously with Ieyasu's transfer to the Kanto region, he was granted a fief of 10,000 koku in eastern Musashi Province. From that time onwards, Niregi Castle was finally abandoned and remains so to this day, but it is now owned by Mr. Oguchi Kiroku and partly serves as a farm.
　　　　　　The Clear Stream of Toyokawa - Various Ancient Names - Bridge Relocation - Land Tax Exemption
　　　　　　- Cargo Transportation Fees - Harbor in the Old Shogunate Era
　The river over which Toyohashi Bridge spans is indeed the Toyokawa River. Its source originates from Mount Dando in Kita-Shitara District, flows south past Danrei village, receives the Sakute River to become the Kankyo River, reaches Nagashino village in Minami-Shitara District where it merges with the Miwa River, then flows southwest forming the boundary between Hoi and Yana Districts and Toyohashi City, and enters Atsumi Bay at Maeshiba village, with a total length of about 17 ri. The ancient name of this river was Akumi River, later also called Yoshida River, and in recent times it had the alternative name Ane River, but this name is not widely known. In ancient times, there was a Toyokawa ferry called Shikasuga between Akumi-go and Watarai-go, but due to drastic geographical changes, its location is now unclear. Originally this name was written as Shikasuga, but from medieval times the characters for Shirasuga seem to have been used incorrectly, and later it was also written as Shikasuga. Crossing Toyohashi Bridge leads to Shimoji-cho within the city. On this side of the bridge is Funa-machi (Ship Town), which gradually developed due to Ikeda Terumasa's bridge relocation, and since there were many boatmen and transportation workers, during the Battle of Sekigahara in Keicho 5 (1600), they traveled to Tsu and Matsusaka in Ise Province under orders from castle lord Terumasa. This connection led to their continued appointment as ship service providers by the domain lord, and they were granted land tax exemptions and permission to collect transportation fees on cargo imported via this river. Moreover, during the old shogunate era, no other harbors were permitted along the Toyokawa riverbank, so ships traveling to and from Ise or Owari regions always congregated downstream, making Funa-machi remarkably prosperous.

　　　　Toyohashi's Famous Traditional Events
　　　　　　Sasa-odori Dance - Fireworks - Oni Festival
　The Genroku era was the height of Edo's prosperity, known to all, and its extravagant customs spread even to rural areas, so the fireworks of Yoshida also became grand from this period. Of course, these fireworks were performed during the festival of Yoshida Shrine, the prefectural shrine in Sekiya-cho, and according to records of the Ishida family, who were formerly shrine priests there, the first large "tatemono" (a type of firework) was created in Genroku 13 (1700), measuring 13 ken in length and 3.5 ken in width, costing 24 ryo. During the old shogunate era, traffic through Honmachi was prohibited during the festival and fireworks were launched within the city streets, but now they are conducted in front of the shrine and over the waters of the Toyokawa River. It is also recorded that the curtains for Honmachi's festival floats required for the same festival were first made in Genroku 16 (1703), and the costumes for the sasa-odori dance from Kaya-cho, which were originally cotton yukata, were changed to silk sarasa-dyed fabric upon entering the Genroku era, and by the 17th year, brocade costumes were created. Furthermore, the same records detail that among the drummers of large and small drums used to accompany the sasa-odori dance, quite remarkable masters emerged. The festival of Yoshida Shrine is held annually for three days starting from July 13th, reminiscent of Yoshida Shrine's elegance. The large cannons and hand-held cannons performed before the shrine on the 13th, the launched fireworks over the clear stream of Toyokawa on the 14th, and the sasa-odori dance on the 15th are remnants of ancient dengaku, while the procession of ten mounted warriors, Yoritomo's old woman, and manju-eating performances continue to be performed at this festival as nationally famous traditions. In addition, the main annual event in Toyohashi City is the Oni Festival at Shinmei Shrine, the prefectural shrine in Nakahachi-cho. This shrine's regular festival is held annually on February 14th and 15th, commonly called the Oni Festival, and the ceremony involves warriors wearing tengu masks and eboshi helmets with light armor chasing away red demons.

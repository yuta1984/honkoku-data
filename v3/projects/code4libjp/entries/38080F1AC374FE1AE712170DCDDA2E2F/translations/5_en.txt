・Hanada Village, and Toyooka Village, consisting of one town and three villages. Among these, the number of households belonging to Toyohashi Town was 3,597 households with a population of 12,339 people. Subsequently, in January of Meiji 28 (1895), the merger of Toyohashi Town and Toyohashi Village took place, and in July of Meiji 39 (1906), the two villages of Hanada and Toyooka were also merged, followed by the implementation of city status in August of the same year. At that time, there were 9,900 households with a population of 37,635 people. Due to the establishment of the 15th Division in November of Meiji 41 (1908), there was remarkable expansion, and by the following year of Meiji 42, it reached 11,759 households with a population of 44,687 people. In the national census of Taisho 9 (1920), the population was 65,163 people, but five years later in the interim national census of Taisho 14 (1925), it was 82,371 people, and in the second national census of October Showa 5 (1930), it reached 98,555 people. Even after the abolition of the division, there was no major impact, and the city continued to show a trend of increasing development due to the remarkable growth of the silk industry.

Furthermore, from September 1, Showa 7 (1932), neighboring towns and villages including Shimoji Town in Hoi County, Takashi Village and Muro Yoshida Village in Atsumi County, Shimokawa Village in Yana County, and Tame district of Ishimaki Village were merged, realizing the great Toyohashi City with a population of 140,000.

Thus, our Toyohashi City is located in the southeast of Mikawa, and now borders Toyokawa Town, Ushikubo Town, and Kozakai Town in Hoi County to the north; Ishimaki Village in Yana County, Chihata Village in Shizuoka Prefecture, and Futagawa Town in Atsumi County to the east; Takayutaka Village and Oitsu Village in Atsumi County to the south; and faces Atsumi Bay to the west. Its position is 137 degrees 23 minutes 30 seconds east longitude and 34 degrees 45 minutes 40 seconds north latitude. The topography is generally flat, but generally speaking, it slopes from east to west, with distances of about 3 ri and 20 cho each in the east-west and north-south directions, having a total area of 6.811 square ri, occupying a pivotal position in the Higashi-Mikawa Plain. Geologically, the lowlands of the city along the Toyokawa River are generally alluvial layers, but most of the urban area is highland consisting largely of Paleozoic layers. The climate varies somewhat from year to year, but summers are not particularly hot,

and winters rarely see snowfall or freezing, and throughout the year it is blessed with clear weather and moderate temperatures, making it one of the nation's leading healthy regions.

Currently, as of the end of March this year, the total number of households has reached 27,529 households with a population of 148,705 people, and both households and population show a trend of continuing increase.

Traditionally, what is called Higashi-Mikawa refers to one city and five counties centered on Toyohashi City: Atsumi, Yana, Hoi, Minami-Shitara, and Kita-Shitara. The towns and villages adjacent to Toyohashi are Futagawa Town, Takayutaka Town, and Oitsu Town in Atsumi County; Toyokawa Town, Ushikubo Town, Kozakai Town, and Maeshiba Village in Hoi County; and Ishimaki Village in Yana County.

Proclamation Regarding Military System Reform

Regarding artillery units:
As the Shogunate has adopted superior foreign weapons and techniques, our domain also commands military system reform to further strengthen our military preparedness, according to His Lordship's wishes. Therefore, each person should well understand this and diligently practice firearms drills. In this regard, the following is newly commanded:

1. Both large and small artillery units shall practice Western gunnery
   Note: Henceforth, all shall also practice square formation drills

1. Regarding unit coordination, this shall be based on skill level rather than social rank

1. As current warfare involves intensive artillery fire, armor shall be omitted and light, convenient battle dress shall be worn
   However: The use of chest armor, arm guards, half-helmets, chain headbands, and padding is acceptable

1. Regarding battle dress, the tailoring of distinctive uniforms and ornate decorations shall be unnecessary

1. Regarding the clothing of samurai rank, gusoku-shita (armor undergarments) and taisode (wide sleeves) shall be used

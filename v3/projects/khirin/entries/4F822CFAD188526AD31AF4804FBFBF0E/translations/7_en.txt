The peasant representatives of Wada Village have submitted a petition regarding a puppet theater performance as described in the attached document. However, as previously established, it is difficult to approve unless it involves donations to temples or shrines. Yet, since the village claims there are no temples or Buddhist/Shinto deities in the area, are they not submitting this petition under the pretext of erecting stone lanterns or similar? Please investigate thoroughly and report the facts in writing urgently. The above.

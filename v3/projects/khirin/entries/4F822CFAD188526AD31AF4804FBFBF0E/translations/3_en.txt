Since it is a riverbed area, many people lose their way and truly experience great hardship - there is no doubt about this matter. Therefore, as the religious association's own resources are no longer sufficient, we humbly request permission to hold a puppet theater performance as outlined in the separate document, and through collecting silver coins as donations and with the assistance of all people, we wish to erect a stone lantern and light a permanent night lamp as in previous years - there is no doubt about our intentions in this matter.

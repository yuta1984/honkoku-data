Memorandum of final written acknowledgments
Regarding the matter of domestic dogs within the protected hunting grounds, there have been repeated investigations since previous years.
Recently, many stray dogs have been wandering about, and there are also
persons with mistaken understanding who give them
food and treat them the same as domestic dogs.
This creates obstacles during falcon hunting expeditions and is
particularly problematic. Therefore, henceforth we order that stray dogs not be kept
and that they be disposed of by taking them to distant places.
This should be made known to every household in every village within the protected hunting grounds without omission.
After such notification is given, if there are persons who do not dispose of the dogs or who continue to keep them,
punishment will certainly be imposed. Therefore,
village officials must thoroughly understand this matter and pay attention from time to time to investigate so that there are no persons with mistaken understanding. After
notifying villages of the above intent, written acknowledgments from each village stating humble acceptance should be kept at
the village headman's place, and regarding this matter, one written acknowledgment per group should be
submitted to the District Magistrate's office by the coming 20th day. Furthermore, this document should be circulated urgently to successive locations
and returned from completed villages. The above.

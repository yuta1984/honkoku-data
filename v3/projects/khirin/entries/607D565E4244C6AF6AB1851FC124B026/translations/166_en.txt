Memorandum Submitted

For the skylark falconry hunt, the falcon masters are going out to the countryside on official business. As is customary each year, we were ordered to construct bamboo enclosures around each field well and erect bamboo grass markers. We humbly accepted this and immediately notified the organized villages and the Tōmyōdō group. They responded that they humbly acknowledge this. Regarding the written acknowledgment from Tōmyōdō village, they stated that the village would submit it directly to the government office. For the other villages, they submitted written acknowledgments as shown in the separate document, so we have compiled them and respectfully present them. The above.

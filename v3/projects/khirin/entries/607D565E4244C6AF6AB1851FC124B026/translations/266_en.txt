Report for Submission
Regarding the matter of Bon festival dancing, from the coming 14th to the 16th day, traditional dancing
may be performed as before. However, going beyond one's own village to other districts is strictly prohibited.
Sudden singing and dancing resembling theatrical performances are difficult to regulate, and every year
we issue notifications before the Bon festival, but repeatedly there are those who do not understand properly, and the
enforcement of these rules becomes lax. This is particularly problematic. Therefore, henceforth,
to ensure there are no violators, all people in the village regardless of status should be summoned and individually
given thorough instruction, and after they understand, each should provide written acknowledgment. Village officials should also
be thoroughly investigated to ensure there are no improprieties. This directive should be communicated without exception to all villages and settlements,
group-level written acknowledgments should be collected, and submitted to the district magistrate's office by the coming 20th day.
Having humbly received these orders, we promptly communicated the details of the official notice to each individual, whereupon
as shown in the separate document, humbly complying, the group village officials submitted acknowledgment letters, which we have collected and
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　respectfully present herewith. The above.

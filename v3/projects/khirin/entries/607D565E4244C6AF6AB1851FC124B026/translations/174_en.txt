Report Memorandum

As the falcon masters have gone out to the countryside for the lark falconry for official use, we have been instructed to construct bamboo enclosures around the field wells as usual and to erect bamboo grass as markers, which we humbly acknowledge. When we immediately notified the group villages, they submitted acceptance documents as shown in the attached paper stating their compliance, which we have compiled and respectfully submit. The above.

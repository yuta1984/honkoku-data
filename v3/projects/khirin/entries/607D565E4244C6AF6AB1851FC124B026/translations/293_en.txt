Memorandum of Completion Cover Letter

At this time, there have been reports of rōnin-like individuals moving about in the Kamigata region and nearby provinces, with prior intelligence regarding their activities, and among them we have heard that there are also those who have engaged in disorderly conduct. While it should be unlikely that such persons would easily cross over to our domain's coastal areas, given the current circumstances, it is difficult to predict whether they might infiltrate through various river mouths or land from the coastal areas. Therefore, detailed official notifications have been issued regarding this thorough investigation. We were ordered to notify all villages in our jurisdiction regardless of who they might be, and to collect and submit group acknowledgment letters. We humbly complied and systematically communicated this intent, and acknowledgment letters stating compliance have been submitted as shown in the attached documents. Therefore, we report the above matter with this cover letter. The above.

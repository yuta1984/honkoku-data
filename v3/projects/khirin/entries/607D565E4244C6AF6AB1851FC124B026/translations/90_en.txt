Regarding the matter of investigating persons matching the above description, we were ordered that each village should take responsibility, instructing village inspectors (gō-metsuke), guard outcasts (ban-hinin), and others to capture and report any such persons as soon as they are spotted. Furthermore, if no such persons have entered the area, written reports should be compiled by group and submitted. We humbly circulated notices throughout the villages in our group and conducted investigations, but since reports with joint signatures stating that no such persons had entered were submitted, we respectfully add our endorsement and submit this report. The above.

Memorandum
This time, all members of the lord's household have been ordered to practice frugality and economy for three years, therefore
the various samurai shall reduce the number of attendants they bring with them, or [travel with] one servant or
no servants, and furthermore shall travel in plain clothing. Accordingly, those of no rank,
lower-ranking persons, and townspeople and villagers, at roadside shops, ferries, and other places along the way
must be careful not to commit acts of rudeness or impropriety. Should there be any who lack understanding
and commit acts of rudeness or impropriety, [such acts] shall be punished without
leniency, therefore their supervising heads
or masters must give strict instructions to each [subordinate] to observe this directive firmly. This time [the order] has been revised and newly issued,
therefore it must be communicated urgently. The above.

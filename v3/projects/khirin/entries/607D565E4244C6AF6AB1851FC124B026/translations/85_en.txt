Memorandum of Acknowledgment Document to be Submitted

　　To the Great Inspector
Regarding the matter of exchange offices for old gold and silver coins including genuine-script two-bu coins and old two-shu silver coins, it was announced last year of the Dog that these would be maintained until October of the current year of the Boar. However, as exchanges still remain incomplete, the exchange offices will continue to operate as before until October of the coming year of the Rat. Therefore, those possessing old gold and silver coins and other such currency must exchange them without fail by the deadline of October in the coming year of the Rat.

1. Regarding grass-script two-bu coins and Bunsei-era recast two-shu silver coins, as has been announced from time to time, those possessing them should promptly bring them forward for exchange.

1. Regarding the circulation of one-shu gold coins, they will continue to be accepted as before until October of the coming year of the Rat, but after that their circulation will be discontinued. Therefore, those possessing them should promptly bring them forward for exchange. Moreover, if anyone continues to use them after the prohibition, this must be strictly reported.

1. As new gold and silver coins are being minted progressively, those possessing Bunsei-era recast gold and silver coins should definitely bring them to exchange offices for exchange. Furthermore, these coins will also be ordered to cease circulation in due course, so understanding this in advance, do not hoard them but diligently exchange them at this time.

From the 10th month onwards, circulation will be completely suspended, so henceforth it must be strictly prohibited from use. However, since there may be unavoidable remaining exchanges in distant provinces and elsewhere, those who possess them even after the suspension should promptly bring them to the previous exchange locations for conversion.
If anyone uses them after the suspension or keeps them stored without exchanging them, they will be strictly dealt with after investigation. The above matter should be announced.
　　　July

As stated above, since this has been proclaimed by the shogunate, the current official has ordered that this be announced in rural areas. Therefore, you must announce this to everyone in your affiliated villages and coastal areas without exception, ensuring no one is left out, and submit written acknowledgments from each village group.
This notice should be circulated smoothly from place to place without delay, and returned from the completed villages. The above.

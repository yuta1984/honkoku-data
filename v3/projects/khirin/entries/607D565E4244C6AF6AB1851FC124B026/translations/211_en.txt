　　　　　Memorandum of submission receipt document
　　　To the Chief Inspector
Regarding vermillion and vermillion ink, we appointed brokers to areas outside the vermillion guild - Edo, Kyoto,
Osaka, Nara, and Sakai - had them post notice boards,
and announced in Kansei 8, year of the dragon that purchases could be made
at discretion from both the vermillion guild and the aforementioned brokers.
However, since we have discontinued the aforementioned brokers, from now on
purchases shall be made directly from the guild.
It is acceptable to retail in the original packaging from the vermillion guild at fair prices.

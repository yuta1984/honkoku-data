　　　　　Petition
In recent years, fly poison has been exclusively sold at various shops in rural areas.
As this is a substance that can harm human bodies, it has been ordered to be prohibited hereafter. Regarding the sale of such substances at various shops and market places in rural areas, the local officials of those areas have been ordered to strictly investigate such matters. Humbly receiving this directive, I contacted the group villages, and as they humbly complied and submitted acceptance documents as shown in the attached papers, I respectfully submit these collected documents. The above.

Memorandum of Supplementary Report
Due to the unprecedented wind and rain of last July, many houses collapsed in the northern and southern districts,
and there are numerous people who have difficulty securing housing, resulting in general
impoverishment and complete hardship. However, regarding improprieties concerning
various merchants' buying and selling activities as well as wages of various craftsmen,
since decisions were made last year in the Mi year, improvements have been gradually implemented.
Nevertheless, to ensure there are no dishonest or misguided individuals, we were ordered to notify the village groups
and collect and submit group acknowledgment receipts. Humbly [complying], we immediately
issued notifications, whereupon each [village] acknowledged and submitted acknowledgment letters, so we have collected them
and respectfully present them with this supplementary letter. The above.

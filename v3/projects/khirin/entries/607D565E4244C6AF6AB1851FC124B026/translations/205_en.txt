For the official business of the skylark falconry grounds, the falconers
have departed to the countryside, so as usual we have been ordered to enclose the field wells with bamboo fencing
and erect marker posts with bamboo grass insignia. We humbly accept this order. Having immediately
communicated this to the villages under our jurisdiction, they have submitted written acknowledgments expressing their humble acceptance as shown in the separate documents,
which we hereby present together. The above.

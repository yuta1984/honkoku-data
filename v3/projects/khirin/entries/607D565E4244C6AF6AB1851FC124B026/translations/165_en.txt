Memorandum submitted with accompanying document

Regarding the matter of investigating those who engage in stone throwing and other illegal activities during wedding ceremonies, we have recently heard that there are those who act with improper understanding, which is extremely improper behavior. Therefore, henceforth investigations shall be ordered as stated in the separate document, and we were commanded to strictly convey the proper understanding according to the government's intent. We humbly accepted this and immediately notified the organized villages. As they humbly acknowledged this and submitted written acknowledgments as stated in the separate document, we present this with an accompanying letter. The above.

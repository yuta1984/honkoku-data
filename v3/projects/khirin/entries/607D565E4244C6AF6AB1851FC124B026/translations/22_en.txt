Memorandum submitted
We were summoned and told that at the locations used for hawking grounds and
fishing along the river courses,
there have been repeatedly unruly persons, which has caused
interference with the fishing activities and hunting gatherings.
Therefore, if there are unruly and thoughtless persons at such
locations in both our districts, it would be extremely
regrettable, so we were instructed to strictly control access to such locations.
Moreover, regarding such locations in your territory and throughout the district,
since the district magistrate also conducts
regular inspections according to his policy, of course we
must pay even greater attention and remain vigilant. Also, along the river courses
and when ducks gather around reed beds,
especially at locations where official hunting parties gather and preparations are made,
we must exercise even stricter control over access and ensure everything is
conducted to your satisfaction.
We humbly acknowledge these respective instructions.

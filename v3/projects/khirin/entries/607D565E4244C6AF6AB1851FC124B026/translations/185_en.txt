Memorandum to be submitted

For the skylark falconry hunt, the falconers have departed to the countryside, and as customary, we have been ordered to construct bamboo enclosures around each field well and to erect sasatake bamboo as markers. We humbly accept this order. We promptly communicated this to the group villages, and as they have submitted written acknowledgments expressing humble acceptance as shown in the attached documents, we have compiled and respectfully submit these. The above.

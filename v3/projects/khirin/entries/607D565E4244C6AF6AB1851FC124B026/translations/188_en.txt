We have been ordered to establish regulations through written rules so that there will be no future misunderstandings, to take thorough measures to ensure strict compliance, and to have village officials convey these to the guard outcasts and submit compiled group acknowledgment letters. We humbly accept this order. When we promptly communicated this to the group villages, the officials submitted written acknowledgments expressing their humble acceptance, which we have compiled and respectfully submit. The above.

Memorandum to be submitted

Regarding urban house and estate certificates, the deputies have affixed their endorsements and individuals have completed their verification seals before transferring them. However, concerning the matter of using these as collateral for pawning, there was a previous official notice strictly prohibiting this practice. In recent years this has become lax, and we have heard that there are people using these certificates as collateral for pawning, which shows a lack of proper understanding. Therefore, henceforth, even if people come to negotiate about using these certificates as collateral for pawning, we have been ordered not to accept them, to communicate this to the group villages, and to collect and submit acknowledgment letters. We humbly accept this order. When we promptly communicated this to the various villages, they submitted written acknowledgments expressing their humble acceptance, which we have compiled and submit. The above.

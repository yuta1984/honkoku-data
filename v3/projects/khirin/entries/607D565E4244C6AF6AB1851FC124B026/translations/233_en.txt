1. When various officials go on provincial tours and advance arrangements are made for their entry and lodging in villages, we shall immediately notify the responsible group leaders and village headmen with written notice. After their departure, we shall compile a written record of all expenses incurred during their stay and promptly submit this record to the group leaders and village headmen, and these amounts shall be collected through the bi-seasonal village assessments.

In respectfully submitting this pledge of compliance with the above arrangements, first and foremost, we shall constantly maintain vigilance, not only regarding the aforementioned hospitality matters but in all affairs, to ensure there are no inappropriate expenses and to reduce the village bi-seasonal assessment silver even by the smallest amount. Should any inconvenience arise in various matters despite what we have stated above, we shall not complain regardless of what orders may be issued. Therefore, we submit this jointly signed pledge without any discrepancy. Above.

Memorandum

Recently, among the townspeople and villagers, there have been those who behave rudely and outrageously when encountering samurai during travel, when boarding ferries together, or when mistakenly boarding river boats. Additionally, there are instances where eta and hinin mingle with townspeople and farmers during travel. Although there have been repeated official notices about this matter, the situation has become particularly problematic. Therefore, investigations are to be conducted as written below, as ordered by the current official. Understanding this, you are to instruct the group village and coastal officials under your authority, and these officials are to notify everyone from farmers to eta and hinin without exception. Furthermore, village and coastal officials and those in related positions should always remain vigilant and give familiar instruction. If there are any who do not understand their place, they must be strictly reprimanded. After thoroughly investigating this matter, compile written acknowledgments by group and submit them promptly. The above.

Memorandum of report
The falcon masters have departed to the countryside
for official duties related to the skylark falcon hunting grounds,
so we were ordered to set up markers at the field wells
as is done every year. Having reverently accepted this order, we immediately
notified the group villages, whereupon they reported their reverent acceptance, so we
submit this written acknowledgment from ourselves. The above.

　　　Memorandum of completed written acknowledgment
Recently, there are many who conduct transactions of various products
using fraudulent heavy-weighted scales,
causing trouble for producers, as we have heard. Of course,
regarding buying and selling, heavy-weighted scales are used in private transactions

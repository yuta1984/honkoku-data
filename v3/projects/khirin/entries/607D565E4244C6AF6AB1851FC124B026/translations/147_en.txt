Memorandum submitted
For the skylark hawking grounds, the official falconers
are going out to the countryside, so as usual, each field well
should be enclosed with bamboo, and bamboo grass should be erected as markers. We were ordered to do this,
and we humbly and immediately notified the group villages. When they responded that they humbly complied,
we submit this acknowledgment letter from ourselves. The above.

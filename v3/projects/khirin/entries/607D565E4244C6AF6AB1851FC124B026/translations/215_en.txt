To those residing along the highways of the designated group villages and coastal areas,
we were ordered to make announcements and collect acknowledgment documents by group and submit them.
We humbly accepted and immediately announced to the group villages, whereupon
acknowledgment documents were submitted as shown in the separate document, so we have compiled them and respectfully present them. That is all.

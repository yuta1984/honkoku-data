The aforementioned production amount should be reduced to one-third as planned. Of course, depending on the location, orders may be given to reduce even within the one-third production, or to completely halt sake brewing altogether, as this is at their discretion. Regarding these matters, sake brewers should be strictly instructed so that there are no misunderstandings. Written records should be made of both the amount of rice used for brewing and the reduced amounts up until the previous Year of the Snake, and these should be promptly submitted to the Finance Office (Kanjōsho) by magistrates, deputy officials, and administrators of directly controlled lands in the case of shogunal lands, and by domain lords and local lords in the case of private domains.
　However, for temple and shrine lands, the temple and shrine magistrates should collect and submit them, and for areas under group control, they should be collected and submitted at their respective locations.
1. Regarding sake shipped from various provinces to Edo and other places, it was announced in the 11th month of last year (Monkey year) that the number of barrels should be understood as one-third of the previous amount, and excess cargo should not be shipped. However, this time the original amounts will be strictly examined, so the matter of barrel numbers requires no special discussion. This should be conveyed to the sake brewers. Moreover, as with last year (Monkey year), inspectors may be dispatched for unscheduled inspections this year as well. If over-production or hidden production is discovered at that time, the person responsible will be severely punished, and even the local officials will be strictly dealt with.
As stated above, understanding this intent, supervision should be strictly enforced by each individual. If there are any negligent measures, it will be considered a grave offense.

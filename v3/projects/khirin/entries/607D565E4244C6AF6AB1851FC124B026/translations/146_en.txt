Gotō Shōsuke
As stated above, since the bakufu has now issued this order, understanding it as such, for the villages under our group,
we were ordered to notify everyone without exception, one by one, and submit
one acknowledgment letter per group. We humbly complied and immediately issued the notification. When
they submitted acknowledgment letters stating they humbly understood the intent of the notification, we have endorsed them and submit them herewith. The above.

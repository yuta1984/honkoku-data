Memorandum of Completed Written Acknowledgment
When various magistrates and officials make inspection tours to the countryside,
regarding the provision of meals and hospitality, arrangements had been previously ordered and established, but
recently there have been changes in practices, so this time the north and south group leader village headmen were
summoned, and future arrangements were graciously announced, with various
opinions and suggestions also being heard, as we have roughly been informed. Therefore,
regarding these arrangement matters, so that there will be no misunderstandings in the future, at this time official notification
documents were issued and ordered, and furthermore the group leader village headmen also
called together and kindly conveyed the instructions, for which we humbly and gratefully acknowledge each directive.
Accordingly, even the small farmers throughout the village were individually called to the village headman's residence,
and with the five-man groups present, we intimately explained the matter, whereupon they said that this
represents the government's considerate intent toward the farmers and they humbly and gratefully acknowledge it
as especially gracious, so hereafter we shall strictly observe the following and
provide hospitality services as required:
1. During inspection tours, we shall absolutely not serve alcohol
　　However, at official rest stops, lodgings, and even to those staying at the inn

Record of Submitted Written Acknowledgment
　　　To the Grand Inspector
The gold currency in circulation has undergone repeated reminting since the Keichō era, so naturally the quality of gold varies between old and new coins, which is a matter of course. There has long been an intention to remint all coins to the highest quality standard, but due to the difficulty of such an undertaking, it has now been ordered that new hanshin (rectangular gold coins) be minted according to the quality standard of Keichō gold, with each piece to circulate as five ryō in value. For currency exchange with silver and copper coins, one should understand the same proportional rates as with koban ichibus and nishūkin, and ensure smooth circulation.

1. It has been ordered that the aforementioned five-ryō hanshin be minted, and that koban ichibus also be minted with improved quality. Regarding this matter, since the total amount of gold will be reduced, in order to increase the circulating money for public convenience, it has been ordered that koban ichibus also be reminted with a weight reduction of five bu per ryō. Currency exchange should be conducted as before, ensuring smooth circulation. The deadline for exchange and other details will be announced later.

1. Regarding the circulation of nishūkin, this should be understood as before. As for nibuban, like with ishūkin, their circulation will be discontinued in the future, so this should be understood in advance. The above matters are to be announced to all provinces.

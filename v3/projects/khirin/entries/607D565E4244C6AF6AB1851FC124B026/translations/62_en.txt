To Tsushima, totaling thirty-five provinces, notifications were previously sent, but there are places where scales that should be confiscated have not been delivered to Jinzen Shirō's establishment, and there are those who engage in improper scale trading, replace cords and other parts on their own, use scales with incorrect weights, or under the pretext of dealing in old tools, engage in buying and selling scales such as wooden beam scales. Such behavior has come to our attention and is unacceptable. As previously notified, when officials from Jinzen Shirō's establishment make their rounds for inspections, all scales must undergo examination without exception. Scales from the thirty-three eastern provinces, thirty-three western provinces, as well as Iki and Tsushima that are not authorized for use and are subject to confiscation must be delivered to Jinzen Shirō's establishment. Those who conceal scales, refuse to submit them for inspection, engage in improper buying and selling, or replace balance beams, weights, cords, and other components on their own initiative shall be severely punished. As previously notified to all concerned parties, in government territories the deputy magistrates, and in private domains the local lords shall issue these notifications. The above.
　　　5th month of the Horse year

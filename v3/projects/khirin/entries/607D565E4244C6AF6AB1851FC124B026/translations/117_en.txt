grass-script two-bu coins, two-shu silver, one-shu silver, etc., have all been

gold and silver coins that have been discontinued up to now
must submit written reports of the actual quantities, however large or small, from each individual to the appropriate authorities.

the amount remaining unexchanged is still considerable, it appears that ultimately those with
sufficient means who hoard gold and silver coins are treasuring what they consider to be of superior quality
and keeping them hidden. While this may be understandable from a human perspective and is not entirely meaningless,
it is a misunderstanding, because gold and silver derive their value as treasure from their circulation in society.
Therefore, no matter how superior the quality of gold and silver coins may be,

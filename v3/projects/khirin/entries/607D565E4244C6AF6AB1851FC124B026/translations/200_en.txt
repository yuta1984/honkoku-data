Dutch book titles that are brought in must be reported to the Nagasaki Magistrate's Office, and those
that receive permission from the magistrate's office may be circulated among the public without problem. This has been ordered,
so henceforth, should anyone handle Dutch books omitted from the above report or privately
translate them, such books shall be confiscated and the person in question shall be subject to strict
interrogation. Regarding this matter, among those of ten thousand koku or more who
have Dutch books translated for understanding coastal
defense and such purposes,
they should record the book titles and report them to the Senior Councilors, and when translation
is completed, submit one copy to the Bureau of Astronomy. The above.

As written above, this time from the
Shogunate there was an official notice, so we have been ordered to disseminate this to all group villages without omission and collect acknowledgment letters to
submit. Therefore, disseminate this to each village without omission, and
prepare acknowledgment letters stating humble compliance, which should be submitted promptly. This document should be circulated to each place without delay,
and returned from completed villages. The above.

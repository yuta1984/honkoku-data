　　　Memorandum of Report
Regarding the skylark duties, as the falcon masters will be coming to the countryside,
we were ordered to have all villages enclose their field wells with bamboo grass and set up markers.
We humbly complied and notified the villages, whereupon acknowledgment documents expressing compliance were submitted as shown in the attached papers, so we have collected these and
submit them herewith with a covering letter. The above.

Such was the intent announced in the previous year of the Rabbit. However,
at this time we have appointed the brokers in the aforementioned five locations as before,
so all should understand according to what was announced in the Kansei era.
If we furthermore hear of any suspicious goods of unclear origin being
secretly bought and sold, we will conduct investigations and
impose strict punishments.
The above intent should be announced to imperial lands, private domains, temple and shrine lands, and rural towns
without omission.
　　Second month of the year of the Rat
The above should be announced accordingly. That is all.

As stated above,
this is an official government edict, so understand it as such. All of you in your
village groups and coastal settlements, regardless of who you are, must announce this, collect
written acknowledgments from each group, and submit them by the 15th of this month. Also, this notification
should be circulated urgently to other areas, and returned from villages once completed. That is all.

[Therefore], we enclosed the field wells with bamboo and erected sasatake markers for each,
and were instructed by the falconry officials to send written reports describing the completion of these preparations.
Understanding these instructions,
we collected acknowledgment letters from the group [villages] to be submitted by the 26th day of this month
as ordered, which we humbly accepted. Having immediately issued notifications, 
acknowledgment letters were completed as shown in the separate documents and submitted from the group villages.
Having collected these, we respectfully present this report with a supplementary letter regarding the above matter.

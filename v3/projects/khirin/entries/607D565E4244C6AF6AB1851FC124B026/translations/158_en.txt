Even though this is to be obtained, there is still a large amount in circulation among the public, and wealthy
households are hoarding them, or in remote and isolated regions
they are still using new and old gold and silver coins mixed together for transactions,
as can generally be heard. The matter of handling prohibited items is
naturally inexcusable, and hoarding them is meaningless. Since the recoinage has been
decreed, if there are many coins remaining unexchanged, the currency in circulation will
actually decrease, naturally causing difficulties in the circulation of all goods.
Therefore, to the leading figures within the domain, the above
purport should be thoroughly explained, so that they will sincerely increase their efforts to submit coins
for exchange. Moreover, depending on the items, there may be cases where the deputy governor will
need to be consulted, so this should be understood. Furthermore,
regarding allowances for exchange agents and holders as well as various travel expenses,
this should be understood as previously communicated, and for locations far from exchange offices,
applications should be made to the nearest deputy governor for
exchange.
The above was communicated after reporting to Lord Abe Ise-no-kami.
As stated above.

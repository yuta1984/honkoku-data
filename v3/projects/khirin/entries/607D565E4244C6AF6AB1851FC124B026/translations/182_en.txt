[continued from previous page] Except for those whose circumstances of concealing their true form have been acknowledged and investigated, temples of this sect shall not take as disciples any monks entering the sect who are not registered in the population records. Moreover, when taking disciples, one must establish as guarantors those who are devoted exclusively to religious duties. Originally, the Fuke Zen sect claims to be a branch of Rinzai, so it should exclusively maintain the Zen spirit, and should not be a path for retired military men or those who claim they cannot reveal their identities. Henceforth, only true komusō shall be permitted, and the designations of "religious connection" and "assistant blowing" shall be completely discontinued. Regarding mendicant practices, like monks of all other sects, they shall receive offerings according to donors' intentions, conduct appropriate religious duties, and lodge peacefully. They shall not claim "official business" or engage in improper solicitation. Since this has been announced to members of this sect, if there are any lawbreakers from now on, they shall be detained at that location and promptly reported to the appropriate authorities.

The above instructions shall be communicated to government domains, private domains, and temple/shrine territories without omission.

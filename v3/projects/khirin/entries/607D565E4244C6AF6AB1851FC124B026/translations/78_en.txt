　　　To the Chief Inspector
Regarding combs, hairpins, hair ornaments, pipes, tobacco pouches, paper cases, metal objects, and other such useless items, the use of gold and silver for such things has been prohibited as proclaimed previously. However, recently it has been heard that there are those who indiscriminately use gold and silver fittings and engage in commerce with them, which is most improper. Henceforth, it is absolutely forbidden for farmers and townspeople to use gold and silver for such items. Even if received as gifts from masters or patron houses, or inherited, no gold or silver objects whatsoever should be possessed.
Regarding this matter, items necessary for samurai use shall continue as before, and other items from samurai houses

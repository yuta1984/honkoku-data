　　　　　Memorandum
Regarding the matter of driving away various birds from rice fields and dry fields within the restricted hunting grounds, there are
some ignorant persons here and there who have
been the subject of thorough investigation ordered repeatedly since some time ago, but for this year, by special dispensation,
permission to drive away birds has been granted from this time forward, so that there will be no misunderstanding,
those responsible for investigation should properly drive away birds
and thoroughly investigate under your supervision

Memorandum of Completion Cover Letter

Regarding the recent designation within the reserved hunting grounds, we have heard reports that there are persons inexperienced in firearms handling who are firing guns indiscriminately, as well as those who fire guns at night during moonlit periods and such times. Therefore, we were ordered to notify the villages in our jurisdiction to ensure there are no such persons, and to collect and submit individual acknowledgment letters. We humbly complied and systematically communicated the intent of this thorough investigation. Each village has respectfully acknowledged this, and acknowledgment letters have been submitted as shown in the attached documents. Therefore, we report the above matter with this cover letter.

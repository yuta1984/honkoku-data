Memorandum of one acknowledgment letter to be submitted
This time, from the
Bakufu regarding the matter of exchanging old gold and silver coins as stated in the separate document
a written notice has been handed down, and accordingly it has been ordered that this be made known throughout the domain.
Therefore, understanding this intent, please notify throughout the villages. The above.
　　　December 25th
　　To the Chief Inspector
The circulation of old gold and silver coins with formal script ni-bu stamps, old ni-shu silver, as well as
Bunsei era gold and silver coins, grass script ni-bu stamps, ni-shu silver, and isshu silver
has been ordered to cease, so we issued a notice in the previous Rabbit year that they should be exchanged by the 10th month of this Dragon year. However, there are still
many remaining that have not been exchanged, so regarding the matter of exchange locations, once again
until the 10th month of the coming Snake year, things will be left as they have been up to now, so in all matters
as previously notified, even people in remote provinces and distant places should understand
and ensure that the exchange process is not neglected. In all provinces and localities,
for bakufu lands through the magistrates, and for private domains through the domain lords and local lords,
careful attention should be paid to implementing this.

Memorandum submitted with accompanying document

In recent years, there has been excessive use of firearms in illegal hunting in mountains and fields. As a proclamation has been issued as stated in the separate document, keep this in mind: village officials should summon poachers to their presence, explain the government's intent, give serious warnings about firearm use, ensure there is no relaxation of vigilance, spread this notice, and have each group prepare and submit written acknowledgments as ordered. We humbly accept this command and have submitted acknowledgments from the organized villages, which we now compile and present. The above.

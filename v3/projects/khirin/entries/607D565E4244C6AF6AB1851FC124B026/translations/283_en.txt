These aforementioned persons are said to be rōnin (masterless samurai) born in Hitachi Province.
Since they have fled, if you observe any persons of suspicious appearance, detain them on the spot,
and promptly have the magistrate (for shogunal lands) or the lord/headman (for private domains) report this,
first to the monthly rotating town magistrate in Edo. If you hear or see anything,
you must report it. Furthermore, you must conduct thorough investigations down to retainers and servants,
and naturally, concealing information or treating this matter negligently
and having it discovered by others would make one subject to punishment.
The above should be proclaimed accordingly.

As stated above,
this is an official proclamation from the Shogunate, so bearing this in mind, in your organized villages and coastal settlements,
regardless of who they may be, this should be made known to all. Furthermore, a written acknowledgment from each administrative unit must be submitted by the 14th of next month. Also, since this proclamation is urgent, it should be circulated quickly,
and returned from each completed village. The above.

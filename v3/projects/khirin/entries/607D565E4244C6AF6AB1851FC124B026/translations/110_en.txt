Memorandum of Completed Written Acknowledgment
Regarding the matter of frugality and economy, [orders] have been issued repeatedly since previous years, and even last year new orders were issued once again. Although it initially appeared that people were observing the official intent, gradually discipline relaxed, and by this time there have been some who lack proper understanding, leading to orders for arrests. This is particularly unacceptable conduct. Should there be anyone who fails to observe the intent of previous proclamations, including regulations on official dress, immediate punishment shall be imposed upon discovery.
Furthermore, the buying and selling of expensive lottery tickets, pet birds and other playthings, women's combs and hairpins, footwear, and even cotton goods if they are high-priced items is strictly forbidden. Therefore, should there be anyone who handles such inappropriate goods in the future, punishment shall certainly be imposed. If there are violators of these articles, the local officials shall also be punished for dereliction of duty. Therefore, vigilant enforcement should be maintained and notifications issued to prevent any misunderstanding.
Since the above orders have been issued by the current office holder, the official intent must be strictly observed at all costs, and furthermore, regarding the various articles of repeated official notices and investigations up to now, careful consideration should be given to ensuring proper instruction so that there are no further misunderstandings. Regarding what has been ordered above:
Since official inspectors will make rounds and there will certainly be punishment not only for violators and those handling inappropriate goods, but also for village officials as stated in the official notice, this should be understood and strict enforcement maintained so that there are no violators even among small farmers, with kind instruction given to all. This notice should be circulated urgently to each area, by group

Petition
Regarding the submission of annual rice tax, as investigations have been conducted recently,
it appears that there are those who handle matters carelessly, which is considered
most inappropriate, and therefore investigations have been ordered. Humbly receiving this directive, I contacted each of the affiliated villages,
and as they humbly accepted, acceptance documents have been
submitted as shown in the attached papers. I respectfully submit these collected from all affiliated villages. The above.

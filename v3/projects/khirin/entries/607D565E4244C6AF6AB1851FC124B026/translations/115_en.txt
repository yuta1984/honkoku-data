Record of Written Acknowledgment to be Submitted
　　　　　To the Chief Inspector
Although those who manufacture counterfeit gold, silver, and copper coins as well as those who sell them are
prohibited by official ban, recently there have been those who specialize in this practice in the Ōu region.
Therefore, after investigation this time, strict punishments shall be imposed on each respectively. Accordingly,
not only in both these provinces but in all provinces, strict investigations shall be conducted.
Each official must inspect without negligence, and if naturally there are any suspicious persons,
they should promptly report to the appropriate authorities. Depending on the case, rewards will be granted,
and arrangements shall be made so that no revenge is taken against such persons. However, if
anyone conceals information despite having seen or heard about such activities, and this becomes known from elsewhere,
even the people of that locality shall be subject to criminal punishment.

According to the above purport, in government lands the deputy magistrates, and in private domains the domain lords and local lords shall
notify all coastal areas, villages, and towns without exception. Moreover, the content of this directive
should be written on wooden boards and erected at the official notice boards.

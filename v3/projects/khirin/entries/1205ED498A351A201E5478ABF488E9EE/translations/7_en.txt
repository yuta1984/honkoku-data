Memorandum submitted regarding the second investigation and inspection
For the repair of the Nankokūzō Hall at Fukuman Temple in Hayabuchi Village, we previously submitted a petition requesting permission to hold a children's
jōruri performance. In response, you ordered an investigation to confirm whether there were no discrepancies with our petition. When we reported that there were no discrepancies with our written petition, you graciously granted approval.
However, due to continuous rainy weather recently, we have not yet been able to hold the initial
performance, and as children have been gradually gathering, the weather delays have caused
complications, creating great inconvenience. Nevertheless, we have heard rumors that we might engage in activities that violate our petition, and therefore you have ordered a second inspection, for which we are deeply apologetic. Regarding the matter of holding children's jōruri performances that we petitioned for previously,
there are no discrepancies. Furthermore, if there are any violations of our written petition,
we will not complain of inconvenience regardless of what punishment you may impose. Therefore,
regarding this second investigation and inspection, we submit that there are absolutely no discrepancies. The above.

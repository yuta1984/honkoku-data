However, as I have heard about what kind of situation has developed, I am asking whether the agreement will be carried out once more exactly as stated in the recent written agreement, and you must report this matter urgently. Of course, if there are any improper matters whatsoever, punishment will be immediately imposed, so I am making this unexpectedly strict inquiry with utmost seriousness. Furthermore, depending on the weather, an official will be dispatched, so please keep this matter in mind as well. The above.

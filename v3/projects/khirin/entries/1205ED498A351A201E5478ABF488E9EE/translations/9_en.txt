Regarding the petition for jōruri performances to fund repairs of the temple buildings at Fukuman Temple in Hayabuchi Village, we ordered an investigation into whether there would be any improper mixing of puppets with singing and dancing in the style of kabuki. Having received a response that there would be no improprieties, we acknowledge this matter.

We were instructed to investigate whether there were any arrangements that might violate the terms of our petition and to submit our application accordingly. We humbly complied and promptly conducted the investigation, whereupon it was reported that no arrangements violating our petition would be made, and we accordingly submitted our request on this matter. However, when asked about what kind of arrangements there might be, we were again instructed to investigate once more whether everything was consistent with our previous petition and to report our findings. We humbly complied and promptly investigated Fukuman Temple and the members of the religious association, and they reported that everything was consistent with what we had previously stated, as indicated in the separate petition document. In this regard, children have been gathering and staying here recently, but due to continuous rainy weather, daily food expenses have been mounting, causing considerable hardship. Therefore, they wish to hold the performance depending on the weather conditions. We hereby report through this written document the results of our second investigation. The above.

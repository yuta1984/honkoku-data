The above has been copied and communicated as stated. Although I had intended to report this matter during the seasonal installment meeting, since this was issued as an official directive, I am communicating it now. Regarding matters such as the number of pawnshop licenses and the list of names, I will seek your opinion during the meeting on the 13th. Until then, I believe it would be appropriate to refrain from group notifications. Please circulate this letter without any delay and bring it to Setoya on the 13th. Therefore, I wish to seek your opinion on this matter. The above.

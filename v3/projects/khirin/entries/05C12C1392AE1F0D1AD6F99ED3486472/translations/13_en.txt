When urban and rural residents have lost items, do they submit formal petitions, or do they come for private investigations? If the theft victims come directly, similar items can be shown on the spot, and we believe there might be cases of concealment or negligence. Since the hinin cannot properly identify similar items when shown, we previously submitted a petition based on this reasoning, and we are grateful that it was approved for all concerned parties. However, the rural residents have now petitioned that the ban-hinin should conduct investigations as before, citing inconvenience, so we respond to your inquiry on this matter.

1. The petition from the rural residents seems reasonable, but as previously stated, there are matters that ban-hinin cannot properly discern. Even if similar items are shown for comparison, unless they personally witnessed what was stolen, they cannot make definitive determinations. We believe this would rather result in double the trouble and expense. However, if the rural areas find it inconvenient, from now on when ban-hinin come as before, we shall conduct investigations and hand over results. However, as previously mentioned, since we must conduct immediate investigations, if days pass, concealment and other complications become difficult to calculate. Therefore, we petition that when lost items occur, investigations should commence immediately. Furthermore, when similar items are found, we propose giving the hinin written descriptions of such items with a set time limit, requiring that by this deadline either the theft victim or someone familiar with the items comes to conduct proper comparisons. This would be convenient for both pawnshops and theft victims, and would likely clarify the hinin's investigative efforts. Of course, we earnestly petition that the hinin be strictly supervised to ensure no irregular conduct occurs.

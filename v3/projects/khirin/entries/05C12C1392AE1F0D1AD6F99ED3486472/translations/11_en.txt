Memorandum of Report

When thieves break in and steal various items in rural areas, rural pawnshops will not accept pawned items unless brought by trustworthy persons. However, urban pawnshops handle whatever is brought to them, so most stolen goods are likely taken to urban areas to be pawned. Therefore, the ban-hinin immediately divide up the work and investigate urban and rural pawnshops, but this is not merely an investigation into whether pawned items exist—it is a duty to inquire about the physical appearance, age, etc. of those who brought items and to investigate leads for capturing thieves.

However, this time the official policy for the town quarters has been restructured, and when ban-hinin visit, they are told not to investigate pawnshop ledgers but to have theft victims go directly to the shops. When theft victims go to pawnshops alone, investigations are not thorough, and even if they encounter thieves, being ordinary people, they cannot capture them. When time passes, the thieves escape.

Therefore, the ban-hinin, who constantly raise their families with the help of rural communities and perform various official duties, find that when urban pawnshops obstruct them, this does not reach the common farmers, who simply think the ban-hinin are not working diligently. If the mood of the entire community turns negative, naturally assistance becomes scarce and official duties become difficult to perform.

Regarding thieves, they likely seek connections with dishonest people in urban areas and roam about. If investigations are not properly conducted, they become even more brazen, and conversely, it may appear that the ban-hinin's control is inadequate, which is deeply concerning. This causes various troubles, so with your mercy, if you would order that they continue to investigate urban pawnshops as before, we would be most grateful.

As a separate written petition requested that we report this matter, we discussed it and truly, if things continue this way, thieves will increasingly flourish. Most importantly, theft victims will lose the means of investigation, ultimately causing trouble for the entire rural community. Therefore, in the future, the ban-hinin...

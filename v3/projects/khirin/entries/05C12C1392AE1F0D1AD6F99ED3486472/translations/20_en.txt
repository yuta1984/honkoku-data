While we do not believe they would deliberately act dishonestly, among the many employees of pawnshops there are some who lack proper understanding, and there are rumors that some, driven by greed for profit, take suspicious items at low prices knowing that if they become forfeited pawns the profit would be substantial. Therefore, if in the future when theft victims and ban-hinin go directly to negotiate, there are no punishments for manipulating records or being negligent, and no fear of future troubles, their vigilance will certainly slacken and they will frequently handle matters carelessly in ways that cannot be predicted. We therefore request that the above measures be implemented.

However, if investigations are conducted as stated in the main text, since thieves rely on pawners somewhere, this would naturally lead to connections and could assist in capturing thieves.

We have stated our thoughts regarding the above inquiry. If assistance can be established for investigations of stolen goods to be thorough, stolen items will gradually decrease and this would be a good method for maintaining order. We therefore request that you consult thoroughly with city and rural authorities. Please advocate for this matter as appropriate. The above.

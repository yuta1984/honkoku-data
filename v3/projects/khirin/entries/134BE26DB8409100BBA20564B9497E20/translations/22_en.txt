The farmers use cotton seeds by steaming them for fertilizer in small rice fields, and although the profit from oil cake is inferior, considering the ratio from low prices, reducing the oil that becomes fertilizer and losing profit is entirely a loss for our domain. If prices were appropriate, after oil is actually produced, using that cake according to the standing crops would create differences in profit and loss.

If operations are concentrated in one water mill location, it would inevitably be criticized as monopolistic buying to gain excessive profit, leading to unpopularity. However, if there are provisions for domain utility and convenience, such suspicions would be dispelled. Furthermore, while commercial enterprises using water mills in urban areas are entrusted to townspeople according to regulations, rather than depriving them of their occupation and causing hardship, when water mill locations are in rural areas and concentrated in one place, being separated by long distances increases transportation miscellaneous expenses, making the remaining seeds cheaper. As stated in government proclamations, due to transportation complications and miscellaneous expenses, previously there were regulations for manual grass pressing, and it appears permission was granted to ship pressing materials to the Kansai region. Accordingly, rapeseed prices are firmly calculated at 80 me per unit, with transportation costs of about 37-38 kan, while 80 me of cotton seeds are calculated at 5 bu per kan, resulting in transportation costs of 1,600 kan. Comparing in silver terms, rapeseed is about 40 bales heavier, making transportation burdensome and immediately affecting prices. Therefore, using water mills conveniently within our domain would be greatly beneficial.

Regarding transportation costs for cotton seeds shipped from Oe, Awa, Mima, Miyoshi and other areas to urban markets, approximately 6 rin 2-3 mō per 1,000 me is required, while pack horse charges from urban areas to Sanagōchi mountains cost about 1 bu similarly. Even abandoning other shipping beach locations, transportation expenses are

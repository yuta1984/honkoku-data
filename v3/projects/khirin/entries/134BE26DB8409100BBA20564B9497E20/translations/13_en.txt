Those who make their living engage in handling these matters.

Item 1: Regarding textile work, even when skilled women in their prime work day and night, they cannot earn more than five or six bu per day. Therefore, for those with little money in this trade, as well as the elderly, young, and sick, it is impossible to earn enough even for daily sustenance, so they dislike even small price reductions.

Item 1: Regarding cotton seeds sold from rural areas, when prices were high, all were sold off. However, in recent years, as prices have fallen, among middle-class and higher farmers, a considerable amount is stored and used for steaming, composting, and field fertilizer. Although the profit from this is inferior to oil cake, since prices have become low, if sold appropriately, cotton seeds can be used to obtain oil, and the cake residue is also beneficial as fertilizer. Therefore, even if losses are small, they would dislike portions that result in wasted expenses.

Item 1: Regarding the collection of cotton seeds within our domain, it seems that commercial activities should be limited to urban areas. However, cotton imported from other domains has, according to ancient regulations, been limited to Shikkenya and Tomioka-cho in the city, where it is received and controlled to serve the domain's needs. Originally, even cotton from other domains, once sold and then the seeds extracted, corresponds to domestic production. Already, cotton wool processed from other domain cotton is treated the same as if called "Awa cotton wool." Similarly, like rapeseed cultivated in our domain, if those in rural oil production purchase directly at reasonable prices, the seeds would be equivalent. Therefore, it is difficult to make a firm decision on this matter, and I am confused.

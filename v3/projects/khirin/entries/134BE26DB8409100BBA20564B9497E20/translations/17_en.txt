Therefore, regarding the water mill operations mentioned in the separate document we respectfully submitted, we have discussed this matter repeatedly and believe that even if you order the commencement of trials at a total of five locations - one in the southern region and three in the northern region, in addition to Sanagōchi - there should be no shortage of cotton seeds. We respectfully submit the following rough calculations:

One item: Approximately 500,000 kan of cotton seeds
　　Note: This amount will vary annually depending on whether the cotton harvest is abundant or poor. However, as mentioned previously, the raw cotton used for the long looms and the seeds extracted from it have been increasing, so we believe it could reach 500,000 bundles based on this estimate.

One item: Five water mill locations
　　Note: While we estimate an average of 100,000 bundles of cotton seeds pressed at one location, we believe it would be uncertain whether such projected operations could be maintained at locations with weak water flow or in valley areas.

This [would produce] approximately 650 koku of white oil
　　Note: Based on a calculation of 1 to 3 shō 6 gō of oil per 100 bundles of cotton seeds

If water mills are established at five well-distributed locations in suitable areas of the south and north as described above, then regarding the white oil that has been restricted due to the previous prohibition of water mills, the newly increased production could naturally be directed for sale in urban markets. Furthermore, concerning seed oil, in areas throughout the three districts where there are no oil pressing facilities, there is insufficient lamp oil production in each district.

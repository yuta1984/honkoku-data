If there are provinces where the production methods for various colored oils are difficult to implement, they may henceforth send orders to the oil wholesalers in Osaka for purchase.

Article 1: Regarding seeds of plants and trees other than rapeseed and cotton seeds that are pressed for oil, products that have been sent to Osaka until now should henceforth be sold to the seed dealers (ryōshutsu-mono-donya) in Osaka, Sakai, and Hyogo. Particularly, items like sesame cake can also serve as food, so they may be sold at will not only to seed dealers but also to anyone who handles such products. If there is surplus from what is pressed for domestic use, this should also be sold to the oil wholesalers in Osaka. Having thus broadly mandated the buying and selling of oil seeds, and having permitted oil pressing for domestic use in the provinces, the provinces should increasingly expand the cultivation of oil seeds, striving to increase trade circulation beyond the previous levels of shipments to Osaka, and conduct sales by sending goods to any of the three locations: Osaka, Sakai, or Hyogo. In recent years, oil production in Osaka has decreased and prices have become high, so in order to bring them down, oil pressers in Osaka and the provinces of Settsu, Kawachi, and Izumi, oil wholesalers in Osaka, seed dealers there, and others engaged in the oil trade, who have until now been paying myōga tribute and transportation taxes to the government, are hereby exempted from all such payments. Since strict control measures have been announced, understanding these matters well, and regardless of individual profit, based on mutual accommodation among all provinces, oil seeds should be priced appropriately according to each year's harvest yield.

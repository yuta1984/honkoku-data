Moreover, with such low prices for transporting large quantities of goods over long distances, transportation costs will inevitably result in even lower prices. If it would be possible, we believe that if operations were permitted in suitable locations, about one per county, there would be no such inconvenience, goods could be sold at reasonable prices, and everyone would be grateful and understanding. If lamp oil were uniformly regulated, even if prices were somewhat high, people could use it according to their household needs and physical circumstances, and complaints would be minimal. However, since such burdens would primarily affect the common people, we humbly request your careful consideration.

As stated above, in response to your articles, we have frankly expressed our thoughts without reservation. Furthermore, even without specific investigation into the aforementioned concerns, if operations were permitted at will, we believe there would be fewer troublesome issues in commerce. Beyond the above articles, we have no other matters we wish to express. We request that this matter be reported appropriately as you see fit. The above.

1. Regarding the pots that the lacquer tappers request from you,
   only the remaining front type will do. The price is one chō,
   one monme and three bu. If you sell from your stock
   to the lacquer tappers, we will pay you one monme in exchange.
   Whenever you have need, we will supply at any time.
   This time we are sending by ship several bright barrels of two-shō capacity, seventy [units], two or three bu.
   As for the price this year,
   we do not know the market rate, so we offer
   at the shortage purchase price. We offer at five-day exchange rate.
   Regarding tare weight, unless it is properly determined,
   it will result in large losses. Separately, for already-filled barrels,
   we sell in bulk lots, and for seepage outside the tare weight,
   we charge an additional forty monme per sen monme.
   In any case, for barrels made in your region, please replace them
   with remaining front barrels and ship them.
   The accounts will be satisfactory. As stated in this document,
   please sell the remainder before new lacquer arrives. Moreover,
   if there is any leakage or movement,
   please record the excess accordingly. Please handle
   matters in this manner.

Thirty-one　Direct statement from the Agricultural Promotion District Magistrate　　【Note slip】"Up to the date"
1. In recent years, the expenditure for agricultural promotion silver has been extensive, and the lower classes have been
working diligently with their own efforts. This year is no different in this matter.
Until now, the initial and subsequent disbursements for public works silver are not fully paid out until around July
after everything is completed. Therefore, when public works are undertaken during spring,
the silver lenders must be asked for advances, which inevitably incurs interest charges,
causing hardship for the construction workers. Moreover, we have heard that public works
may not be completed satisfactorily. Given that there are many impoverished people due to recent poor harvests,
regarding the agricultural promotion public works for the current 27th year,
small farmers shall work diligently, and daily wages shall be distributed equally to each person.

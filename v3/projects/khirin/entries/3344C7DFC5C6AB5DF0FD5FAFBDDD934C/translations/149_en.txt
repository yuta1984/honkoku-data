　　　　Investigation report delivered to group headmen and village chiefs

Regarding persons from other domains without travel permits, suspicious persons, and Shikoku pilgrims and similar types, although investigations have been repeatedly ordered, they still appear to be infiltrating remote areas. Therefore, investigations and expulsions were ordered in June of last year, which initially reduced their numbers. However, recently such persons again appear to be infiltrating remote areas. This appears to be due to laxity in investigation methods, which is a serious matter. Therefore, strict investigations are once again ordered. With thorough understanding of the previous instructions, investigations shall be conducted simultaneously in all villages and coastal areas on the coming 18th, with officials in attendance, and after expulsion at the nearest domain borders, their domains of origin and names shall be recorded in registers and submitted to the district magistrate's office. Furthermore, regarding future matters, officials must thoroughly understand that they must not become lax in their duties.

Regarding the recent decisions on frugality, economy, and official clothing regulations, we have heard that due to the increase in people purchasing cotton and wool materials, prices have risen. We have also heard that some merchants are treating cotton and wool at prices equal to silk. This conduct contradicts the policy of frugality and economy and demonstrates a particularly poor understanding of the situation.

Should there continue to be such people, they shall be strictly investigated and punished. To this end, those engaged in such commerce shall be thoroughly investigated by the town magistrate's office. The investigation of the city has been conducted to this extent, and particularly now that the policy has been announced once, should there be any inappropriate handling of goods or price increases in rural areas, this cannot be left unaddressed. After conducting investigations, strict punishment shall be applied according to the circumstances.

Regarding this current matter, you (local officials) shall visit those who are engaged in such sales and thoroughly and kindly instruct not only the principals but also their family members and servants so that none shall be mistaken in their understanding. This was ordered to you in the 10th month of the previous year of the Ox.

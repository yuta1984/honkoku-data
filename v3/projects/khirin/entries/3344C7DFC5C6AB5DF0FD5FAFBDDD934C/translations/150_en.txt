○【In red ink】　　Notification to group headmen and village chiefs of various districts
Sixty-three

It is reported that people of the city and villages are properly observing the regulations regarding prescribed clothing. Furthermore, instructions have been given that they should understand not to become lax in this matter going forward, and this matter of official punishment has been communicated through notifications from the chief supervisors. Particularly, it is understood that handling of silk goods, and even cotton goods of high value, should not be permitted, yet it is reported that such goods are being handled in remote areas. Therefore, it has also been communicated that the sources of such sales should first be investigated. Accordingly, regarding this notification, it is of course necessary to investigate those who are negligent so as not to become lax. However, given that there are differences in local customs and mountain village conditions from ancient times, and that detailed enforcement throughout all areas both near and far must be adapted to the circumstances of each locality to ensure continuity, opinions should be discussed and reported regarding the direction of such investigations.

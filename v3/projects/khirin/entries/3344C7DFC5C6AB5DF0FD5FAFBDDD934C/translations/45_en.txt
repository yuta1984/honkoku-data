Allocation rice and similar provisions will be reduced proportionally. Each of you should communicate this to all members of the retainer band and the three named men of Ikeda, and should also inform those under your supervision.

Furthermore, regarding Kyoto and Osaka, this should be communicated to those residing in those places, as well as to those receiving stipend support and assistance grants, and this matter should be conveyed to the respective deputy governors (karō). Additionally, regarding temples and shrines that receive land grants, as well as town magistrates and district governors, the same reductions apply to temple stipends, townspeople's support allowances, small stipends, allocated rice fields, and land grants. This also applies to all other minor allocations, so arrangements should be made to ensure nothing is overlooked. The above.

However, regarding debt service and repayment of borrowed silver, if this continues as is, the hardship will become even greater. Therefore, through special deliberation, the burden will be somewhat eased during the designated period for salary reductions. Those who have borrowed funds should consult with the treasury magistrates regarding repayment methods.

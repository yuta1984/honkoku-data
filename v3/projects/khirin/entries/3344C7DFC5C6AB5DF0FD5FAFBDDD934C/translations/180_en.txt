As stated in the attached note:
Regarding the various disputes that have arisen since the 4th day of the 3rd month, for cases that should be decided at the government office, we request that they be handled at the government office. For other cases that have been assigned to local yorito (village group leaders) and village headmen in their respective districts, we believe they should be handled jointly this time. However, as stated in the main text, since approximately twenty days have already passed, we will be entering the busy farming season. Moreover, regarding the cases we are returning, since most involve complex interwoven disputes, we believe the timeframe and handling approach that were previously clarified should be adjusted. Therefore, we request that these matters be postponed for now. We respectfully submit this matter through this attached note.

1st day of the 4th month
　Note from the deputy on yellow paper
We respectfully request that the withdrawn dispute cases and all dispute handling matters since the 4th day of the 3rd month be handled as requested by the Myoto yorito.
　However, if handled as requested, since we will be approaching the 5th month, with a twenty-day deadline, we must proceed without delay...

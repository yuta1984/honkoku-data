Regarding the hunting of suspicious persons, as previously arranged between the city and villages, from the 28th day of the second month for four days, the dōshin, gesaiban, and bannin from Oyamashita and village districts conducted patrols in Misaki and withdrew after completing their rounds. Furthermore, in mid-third month, based on the arrangements made between the city and villages in the second year of Ansei (Year of the Rabbit), they extended operations not only to Oyamashita but also to distant areas, dividing into multiple teams, with particularly thorough measures to be taken in Oyamashita. While these various arrangements were being discussed, regarding the case of Shigeichiro, son of Jihei from Kajiyahara Village in Itano County, who while serving at Mikawaya Tōshichi's establishment in Kitahorie 4-chōme in Osaka, attempted adultery with Tōshichi's wife, wounded the couple, stole money and fled - concerning this investigation, the Osaka deputy (staying behind) was contacted by the Eastern and Western magistrates, and the deputy instructed the chief officials to conduct thorough investigations. Following orders from the main officials, detailed house-by-house investigations were to be conducted from Oyamashita and village districts to distant areas. While these arrangements were being made, there was also correspondence from Kamata Kyūtarō of the Sanshū road administration to Tsuchitani Ichizaemon in the city regarding wanted persons, and there were also consultations with the chief officials. The investigation of the aforementioned Shigeichiro and the pursuit of suspicious persons were to be handled simultaneously, with instructions to exercise the utmost care in these arrangements - Chief Official Sukawa Gentabei

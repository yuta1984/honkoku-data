Regarding the villages subject to tax collection, or indigo plantations and other areas that are entirely dry field cultivation where all collections are made in silver - for such lands, considering first the poverty or wealth of the land quality and the financial circumstances of the farmers, the village headmen and tax collectors should thoroughly understand the situation and provide guidance to the small-scale farmers. They should assess the actual conditions within each village and make every effort to arrange payments within the year. For amounts that are truly difficult to manage, they should ensure full settlement from next January through March. For the amounts that will remain until next spring, they should establish projections for how much can be managed in January, and how much each in February and March, and report these to their supervising group leaders and village headmen. Regarding the details of this matter, depending on the particular circumstances of each locality, they should thoroughly understand how to serve the interests of both higher and lower authorities and proceed with collections accordingly.

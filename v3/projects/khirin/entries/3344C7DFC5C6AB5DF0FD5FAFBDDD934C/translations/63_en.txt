Even if [the birds] cause damage, since [crops] will sprout again, there is no particular inconvenience. However, from around the twentieth day of the first month until the spring equinox is the time of grain formation and sprouting, so if [the birds] feed destructively during this period, [the crops] will not regenerate. If the farmers' labor of several months becomes worthless in an instant, this would cause particular worry, as we have heard. However, at that time it approaches the season when migratory birds depart, and the days increase, making the previous responsibilities difficult to manage. Therefore, from the end of the first month until the spring equinox, following the annual variation in climate timing, regarding this seasonal matter that is reported from time to time, would it be possible to grant some relaxation of the prohibition on goose-driving for approximately fifteen days? If so, the farmers would greatly rejoice and be deeply grateful, and naturally their understanding would improve, leading to better compliance and more thorough enforcement. Of course, if this request is granted, we will instruct that there be no inappropriate driving methods, and furthermore, the matter of investigation requires consultation. We humbly request your deliberation on this matter as appropriate. Above

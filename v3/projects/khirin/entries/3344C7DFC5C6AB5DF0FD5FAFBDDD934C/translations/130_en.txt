This is what has been decided. However, regarding the recent proclamation and circulation of orders concerning frugality, economy, and official clothing regulations, we shall consult further with the town magistrates and conduct thorough investigations starting from the primary sellers down to the very last link in the chain. Therefore, after ensuring thorough understanding and convincing each party accordingly, written pledges and agreements must be obtained and submitted.

Furthermore, you (local officials) must also conduct thorough investigations among the people of your associated villages and, based on this matter, remind them once again to observe the policy of frugality and economy.

If we assign handlers, there are also previous procedures, so there may be cases where resolution can be achieved quickly. Regarding Myōsai District, since this is also the time for mid-planting, we have ordered that in about three locations within the district, two or three people each should gather at the homes of the yorito and village headmen for approximately twenty days of case handling. If we do this, for Myōdō District, being nearby, the city center would be more convenient for the common people, while for Myōsai District, being quite distant, gathering and handling cases at the yorito's homes would be more convenient for the common people—such were the opinions you expressed. After investigating various matters and considering that the time period is brief, we now hand over once more those cases that were withdrawn as you requested. You should thoroughly understand the principles we agreed upon previously and exercise good judgment in case handling so that there are no mistakes in sequence. Regarding petitions and disputes from the 4th day of this third month onward, cases to be handled at the government office will be called up gradually, and matters to be handed over to you will be sent according to custom through written orders after consultation, as has been done traditionally. You should understand this accordingly.

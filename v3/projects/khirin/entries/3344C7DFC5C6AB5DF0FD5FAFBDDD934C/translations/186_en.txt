At this time, there was a request to begin around the tenth day of next month, so when we ordered them to set a deadline and present their thoughts for consultation, they stated that it would indeed be the busy farming season as mentioned, with no respite from next month through the sixth month due to wheat harvesting, indigo water collection, wheat ripening, indigo harvesting, and other tasks. Regarding Hyōemon, we surmise that he is considering the convenience of the office and will pay his respects on the tenth day of next month.

Under these circumstances, while urgent unavoidable matters at this time would be exceptional, if we follow the precedent of the twentieth day of this first month and have everyone handle cases from the twentieth day of the seventh month, then those who come and go would understand, and the group leaders could arrange official duties from now and prepare accordingly. We humbly inquire about this matter after consultation.

However, regarding the matter of Myōdō Tezaki as well, since it is as we mentioned in our previous brief submission, should this be ordered as stated in the main text?

Fourth month, nineteenth day, Year of the Horse

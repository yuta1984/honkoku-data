Regarding the matter of the goose-driving request, Wakayama Rokujuro reported that permission has been granted. Since this follows the annual precedent, he instructed that the method should be understood as similar to the boar and deer scaring guns, and that consultation with the falconry officials at the time should be conducted to confirm whether there are any obstacles. Accordingly, this matter has been communicated to the village headmen through the group leaders.

Correspondence from Rokujuro-san to Shobei, Fifth month, 27th day, Bunka 3, Year of the Tiger

Regarding the previously submitted request for permission to drive away the prohibited wild birds, after discussion it was understood that the villages are indeed facing unavoidable difficulties, and since this is a matter with limited seasonal timing, we have duly received and acknowledged [the request]. Therefore, Wakayama Rokujuro-san has instructed that when the time comes, applications should be made from time to time as needed.

Regarding this matter, the same instructions should also be communicated to all colleagues in similar positions. In response, when asked whether we should keep the petition we submitted in mind and consult as each occasion arises, [he replied that] since the official document also states that timing may vary according to annual climate conditions, you should proceed accordingly. Ultimately, once the fundamental framework is established, this will be handled similarly to the scaring guns, he informed us.

Memorandum

Due to the recent continuous heavy rains, when officials of the horse department were dispatched north and south to inspect the flooding conditions of the river areas, people from rural villages brought horses into the city and tethered them with long ropes for extended periods in front of shops and doorways, obstructing traffic. Previously, we had issued directives to use short ropes when tethering to avoid hindering passersby, and had prohibited driving horses ahead, yet we hear that some thoughtless individuals still occasionally drive horses ahead. Regarding these matters, we have repeatedly issued official notices since some time ago ordering strict compliance, but recently we hear that there are still some thoughtless individuals, which is quite unacceptable. Henceforth, strict measures must be taken to ensure there are no more thoughtless individuals. Should anyone violate the intent of these official notices in the future, not only the individuals themselves but also the village officials shall be punished. Therefore, to ensure this message reaches all villages in your groups without exception, submit written acknowledgments, one per group, to the district administrator's office by the 20th of this month. The above.

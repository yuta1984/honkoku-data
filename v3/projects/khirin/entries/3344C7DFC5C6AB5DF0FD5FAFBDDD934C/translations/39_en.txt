Regarding whether we should instruct those among the aforementioned Myōsai who are present to communicate accordingly.

Copy of Official Directive Regarding Pack Horse Regulations in Town Areas
○【Red notation】Thirteen　Kōka 2nd year, 6th month, 19th day
【Attached note: "Up to the proviso"】

1. From Tōrimachi-suji to Shimmachi Bridge area, from Nishi-shimmachi 1-chōme area to Sako-machi 11-chōme Kami-Aikui, and south from Daiku-machi area to Nikenya-machi.

Regarding pack horses on these road sections: when horse handlers accompany their animals and negotiate at shop fronts while tethering them, this is acceptable. However, when horse handlers unavoidably leave their horses and must tether them elsewhere, they must lead the horses into the shop courtyards. If the shop courtyard is too narrow, horses may be placed sideways under the eaves, with ropes kept short and arranged in a wide circle so as not to obstruct passersby. Should anyone violate these rules, upon detection, both the people and horses shall be detained at that shop, and after investigation, both the shop owner and horse handlers shall receive appropriate punishment.

Provided that when such regulations are ordered to be implemented, notification should also be sent to the district administrators, and we believe notification should also be given to those who serve as riding officials and water inspectors.

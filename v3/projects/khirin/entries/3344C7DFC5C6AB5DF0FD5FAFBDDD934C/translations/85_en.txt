Item: Regarding lodging fees for village headmen (shōya) and five-man group representatives
　who travel on official business for document submission or various official duties,
　previous regulations set the rate at 1 monme 2 bu for headmen
　and 1 monme for five-man group representatives. However, these standards have become
　lax, so although orders were given the year before last to follow
　the previous regulations, there are circumstances where they are not being observed.
　Therefore, henceforth, without distinction between headmen and five-man group representatives,
　2 monme each shall be allocated.
　This must be communicated not only to rural officials but also
　to everyone else without exception.
　The above is a copy of an official notice from the Kyōwa era

Item: Regarding the expenses for group leaders (yotō) and village headmen on official business
　that were recently reported—tatami fees, paper and ink costs, scribal fees, lodging
　at 1 monme per day, or monthly shaving and tobacco costs, etc.—matters that have been
　practiced in recent years based on traditional customs outside of the Kyōwa-era
　regulations should be thoroughly investigated by making detailed inquiries to the group leaders.
　Kaei 4, year of the boar, 5th month, 11th day: Following orders to make inquiries
　to both Matsue Shimasa and Satō Kumesaburō,
　a report is to be submitted by the 16th of this month.

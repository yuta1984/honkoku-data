Memorandum Submitted

This year, both rice and certificates have risen to high market prices. Following your previous determinations, we have been operating to ensure complete payment by the designated date. However, considering that further price increases might cause additional hardship, if you would grant an extension until next March for the portion of deferred payments (buekake), the market prices would naturally moderate. Through thorough deliberation, your intentions have been conveyed, and we have been ordered to discuss the implementation methods and report on the conditions in various districts, for which we are most grateful and humble.

We have reported in detail since recently, but as implementation across all districts uniformly is difficult, we have been further ordered to report on conditions district by district, which we humbly acknowledge. When we reconsidered and discussed among ourselves, regarding our district, since most are rice-farming villages, both regular annual tribute and deferred payments have already been investigated for their rice payment arrangements, and some villages have gradually operated and completed their full payments.

Regarding the remaining villages, when extensions are granted for deferred payments according to your intentions, while this would be a gracious measure, everyone would become relaxed, and with the New Year being an expensive month, this might lead to temporary extravagance and ultimately result in difficulties in collecting and organizing payments come spring.

We understand that we should operate to arrange payments as quickly as possible within the year, but if we rush to collect and organize everything, given this year's circumstances, many stipend recipients might fall into arrears.

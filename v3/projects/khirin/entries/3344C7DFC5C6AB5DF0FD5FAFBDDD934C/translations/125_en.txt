Item: Regarding the villages west of here, they have long suffered hardship due to poor water access. However, concerning the Enmei Village well entrance, a request was made to construct access to the cape platform marker within Irita Village territory. Public works have been ordered since this spring, and the arrangement worked out extremely well. From the time of summer planting, irrigation water reached even the lower villages, resulting in abundant harvests. Even the small-scale farmers of the entire well group are grateful and wish to offer 12 koku of rice from the surplus of this autumn's tax rice as a religious offering in gratitude for the national benevolence, from all the villages of the well group.

1. Due to the earthquake and tsunami of the year before last, the Tosa domain area has many collapsed and washed-away houses along the Shikoku pilgrimage routes, causing difficulties with lodging, so people shall not be allowed to enter the Tosa domain area. Within our own domain as well, Kaifu County has land that was devastated and lost due to the tsunami, and there are places where lodging arrangements are difficult. If they enter that county, they will face hardship. Particularly for begging pilgrims, they cannot arrange to receive alms. Since Tosa domain has such circumstances, everyone is being turned back, and as their distress is evident, this should be kindly explained at the domain border guard stations.
　　However, in order to quickly inform the temple stamp offices in each county about the intent of this main text, the village headmen and chiefs should have this explained to those who come for sutra copying.

1. Even if those listed in our domain's population registers come to village officials requesting travel permits to go on the Shikoku pilgrimage, they should be informed of the circumstances mentioned in the previous section.

The above arrangements are hereby ordered. Furthermore, matters pertaining to such cases should be handled according to the regulations from the year of the Boar.

Regarding the matter that all villages have good water access, all had abundant harvests, and are gratefully aware of this - there is no discrepancy in this account. Since this is the application of the entire group, the Tezaki district magistrate has submitted documents asking whether it would be appropriate to allow them to proceed as requested, with the petition attached. Having reviewed this, since this is an application from the assembly, the main administrators communicate that they should be informed to proceed as requested.

The above matter: On the 27th day of the 12th month of Ansei 1, Year of the Tiger, at the district magistrate's office, District Magistrate Misawa Shuntaro ordered that the aforementioned documents be handed over to Goto Shosuke and Yuasa Ryusuke, that copies be made, and that the information be passed on to other officials of the same rank.

○ [Red ink] Fifty-nine: To the Eastern Katsu District Office
His lordship thinks that the handling of official complaints (hakuso) and petitions (meyasu) is taking too long, and has issued instructions from Edo to the local officials here that such matters should be processed more quickly going forward. This was communicated by the head administrators, and we informed you of this the other day. We shall also inform the Tezaki group leaders and village headmen to handle cases more expeditiously when we meet with them. Of course, the names of said individuals shall be recorded, and above their names shall be written the date on which the matter was received.

As stated in the separate document, from the village headmen of both post-horse station cooperative villages to the Hiwada-ura magistrate's office in Ama District: Regarding the matter of porters for transporting the luggage of officials on official assignment and rotation from the Awa District area, since last year (Mi year), travel permits have been issued for the upper route through the Oe District post-horse stations, and although the routing is irregular, if there were disruptions in porters at these post-horse stations, it would immediately cause delays in official business, which would be most regrettable. Therefore, we have been performing these duties unavoidably to prevent such disruptions, but if this continues, since the post-horse duties in our district are already particularly busy with official business and the farmers are suffering greatly from the burden, they have complained about the hardship of performing such additional duties.

Therefore, while officials traveling from Tokushima to the Awa District area have customarily used the Naka-Ayukui route post-horse stations as established practice, for the transport porters for officials traveling from the Awa District area to southern areas as mentioned above, we request that travel permits be issued for the middle route post-horse stations according to established practice, which has been petitioned to us.

If such irregular post-horse station porter duties continue to be assigned, this becomes an additional burden, causing extreme hardship to the farmers of these post-horse station groups.

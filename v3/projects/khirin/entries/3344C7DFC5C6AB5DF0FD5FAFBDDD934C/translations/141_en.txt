Additionally, there are cases where some people, with a special mindset of accumulating hidden virtues, are providing a decent level of support.

Under such circumstances, suspicious persons without travel permits and other vagrants are wandering around various places begging for rice and money, which is particularly problematic and cannot be left as is. Although notices have been issued repeatedly since previous years, and investigations have been ordered multiple times from the 4th year of Kaei, year of the Boar (1851) to last February of the year of the Tiger (1854) according to the articles written below, it appears that suspicious persons are still wandering around in remote areas. While this earthquake affects all provinces, regarding the situation within our domain as mentioned above, if many vagrant suspicious persons continue to roam about, it could become a source of additional hardship for the already suffering people. Therefore, we are ordering even stricter investigations of suspicious persons from other domains who lack proper travel permits. Based on the articles below, conduct thorough investigations in villages and coastal areas. Regarding the expulsion procedures, begin from the city areas, extend to the villages at the foot of the mountains, and then systematically extend to remote areas in the prescribed daily schedule as follows.

However, regarding the legitimate pilgrimage travels with proper travel permits and entry permits that were announced in the articles early this year, since no time limit can be established for such travels, in this case, those who have remained within our domain for more than fifteen days shall be expelled at the border. Those who are genuinely unable to walk due to illness shall be allowed to recover and then expelled at the border after their recovery. Also, regarding wandering in monk's attire without proper credentials, investigations are conducted from time to time, but it is reported that there are those who enter rural areas and improperly beg for rice and money.

This is an unsatisfactory situation, so from now on, villages that do not report completion by the 20th as determined shall have their ongoing public works halted, and this should be understood accordingly.

1. Regarding the deadlines for commencing public works and completion notifications, until now these have been reported to the public works official's office, but from now on it will not be necessary to report to the public works official; instead, reports should be made to individual offices.

The above has been determined for the future, so first of all, you must thoroughly and deeply understand these matters, listen carefully to the instructions, and strictly observe them so that there will be no improprieties in the future. Regarding this year's matters, since the initial petition documents have already been submitted quickly, you should understand from last year's precedent as stated above, and regarding copying specifications, you should understand from this year forward as clearly stated above.

Delivered directly on the 4th day of the 12th month of Kaei 5, Year of the Rat [1852]

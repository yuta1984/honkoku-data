Following instructions received through consultation from Tsuda Kanō to Hozumi [Kōkō], the handling shall be as follows:
　　However, in the correspondence from Kamata Kyūtarō to Tsuchitani Ichizaemon,
　　it was stated that since this was an internal matter, it would be difficult to proceed without
　　official consultation, but since this time it concerns the investigation of Shigeichiro
　　from Kajiyahara Village, it shall be handled as stated in the main text.
　　　Intercalary Third Month, 13th day
As instructed by the chief officials as stated above, since this matter requires exceptional investigation,
one dōshin, two gesaiban, two village inspectors, and two bannin - these seven persons shall form
one group, with three groups dispatched to the northern areas and two groups to the southern areas for patrol rounds,
to be dispatched in the near future. Since investigations must extend even to the deep mountain areas of the north and south,
each group should understand how to properly utilize village inspectors and ensure all matters are arranged conveniently.
Regarding these duties, you too must remain vigilant and
alert, and should any suspicious persons be found, report them immediately.
　　However, since ship arrangements have also been ordered for this matter, when the time comes
　　and the dōshin request small boats for transport and deployment, you should understand
　　to ensure there are no obstacles.

We have received your communication by letter. On this occasion, the temple monk Seishin from Myōan-ji Temple in Kyoto, which is the head temple of komusō monks, along with his assistant Kaiki, both came down to oversee religious sect affairs and will be staying from this month until July. They have requested to conduct flute-playing pilgrimage training once per month, and contrary to the established agreement since Bunka 7 (1810), they have applied to our fellow officials in the north and south districts to receive three months' worth of flute-playing fees in three installments.

Therefore, meeting with fellow officials in the city, we two officials visited Seishin's lodging and have been engaged in various negotiations since the day before yesterday. Although we reached an agreement that he should receive payment for one time only and return to Kyoto as has been the custom, since the assistant Kaiki went to the northern district area recently and apparently made claims to receive payment for three times, we cannot easily hand over payment just because he requested it. However, since some village areas may grow weary of negotiations and mistakenly think it would be better to just give him the money since it's a trivial matter, we are notifying you as a precaution.

Please summon the village headmen of the villages in your group and ensure they thoroughly understand this matter. Also, please circulate this letter to the various areas without any delay. We are writing thus to inform you of this matter. The above.

Regarding the matter of frugality, economy, and official dress regulations, although written notifications have been transmitted repeatedly since previous years, and for the time being people appear to be observing the official intentions, they have gradually become lax, and particularly in recent years, it seems that especially arrogant people have been following extravagant trends. It is heard that there are those who go against the official intentions previously announced, which is a matter of poor understanding and misconduct. Therefore, henceforth, make firm reforms, observe the official dress regulations, and do not use expensive items from combs and hairpins to footwear. The above principles should be carefully enforced with thorough attention. Moreover, if there are still those who misunderstand and do not observe the transmitted official intentions, they shall be arrested and punished without leniency. Furthermore, when others travel on the roads, they should mutually yield the way to each other, but it is heard that some show no consideration at all and behave rudely and outrageously toward various samurai, which is particularly misconduct. Henceforth, such behavior should not occur. If there are violators of the above matters, the local officials will also be held responsible for negligence, so they should investigate thoroughly without negligence. This matter should be announced through the town magistrates and district governors, as communicated by the inspectors.

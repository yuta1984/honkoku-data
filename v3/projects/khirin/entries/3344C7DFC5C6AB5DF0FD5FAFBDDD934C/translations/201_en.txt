From the group leaders and village headmen to the village headmen
　　　　and tax collectors - General instructions to be communicated

Regarding the matter of the 3.5 bu deferred payment collection that has been ordered this time, although it should have been collected in the same manner as the regular annual tax, through careful deliberation it has been graciously extended from this time until next March. The intention behind this decision is as follows: if the collection of these deferred payments becomes too urgent, it would affect the collection of stipends and annual taxes, and even the stipend recipients might face pressing circumstances. If the collections from stipends also become too frequent, the peasants' finances would become strained and they would suffer hardship. Considering this situation, through careful deliberation, if the deferred payments are ordered to be fully settled by next March, the peasants' financial situation should become more relaxed. With this relief, the stipend payments and annual taxes should naturally proceed at a reasonable pace, and even villages that have fallen into arrears with their land taxes should be able to arrange full payment. This policy has been announced based on this expectation. However, if the deferred payment collections that have been mercifully suspended this time fall behind schedule, it would create inconvenient circumstances, so we respectfully and carefully consider all these factors.

Regarding the land matters in various rural districts, there are many obstacles causing hindrances, so
inevitably performances must be held within Niken-ya Shiomi-ji temple grounds or at Sako Ōtani,
which has caused continuous difficulties for the petitioners.
Concerning this matter, hereafter according to the above principle, all performances shall be held from the northern corner below Semi-yama to within Kannon-ji temple precincts, and most appropriately when venues
conflict and cause hindrance, they may also be held at other locations. Furthermore, when such orders are given,
regarding donation puppet shows and similar entertainments petitioned from the twenty-one villages and ports below the sacred mountain to the district magistrate's office, when the same location does not cause hindrance, performances
shall be held at the aforementioned location.

1. Regarding sumo wrestlers from the city holding one-day practice
wrestling matches monthly at various locations, hereafter all such events shall be held on the mountain behind Konpira
Shrine or within Kannon-ji temple grounds.

1. Regarding grand sumo, medium sumo, and celebratory puppet shows,
although we would like to hold performances at the aforementioned nearby locations, these require temporary structures
and considerably wide spaces, without which they cannot be conducted, so these
shall continue to be held at other locations as before.

The above matters have been communicated from the town magistrate's office.

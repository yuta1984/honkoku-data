We respectfully submit this letter to you. Regarding the matter of the koranrai (suspicious person hunt) this time, as you are aware during this period, concerning the御山下組々 (Oyamashita groups), rural inspectors have been assigned to patrol and reside in the villages. However, for areas outside of御山下, no such arrangements exist, and we fear that when the time comes, it may not be possible to provide proper convenience for official duties. Having discussed this matter among ourselves, we have compiled the details in a written document as follows and submitted it to you. Since it has been received, we ask that you acknowledge this matter. First, we respectfully request that you relay this matter to the appropriate authorities. The above.

Should we understand this as an official order?

One, group leaders, village headmen, and village inspectors should appear for duty wearing half-coats and leggings.

One, regarding the breaking of various tools, removal of roof thatch, etc., we believe these should be ordered by the attendant officials.

One, the outcasts have countless family members, and the labor required to handle this is difficult to calculate. How should we understand the approach to this matter?
If this workforce is insufficient, the attendant officials should arrange for nearby outcast guards to be assigned to proceed quickly.

One, when group leaders, village headmen, and village inspectors move to other villages, should we understand that they should report for duty daily?

One, how should we understand the matter of providing meals for the dispatched officials?
However, group leaders, village headmen, and other village officials should understand that they should come prepared with their own provisions.

We humbly inquire about instructions regarding the above matters.

Tenpo 13, Year of the Tiger, eleventh month - From the group leaders and village headmen of Tomita, Tsuda, Sako, and Okisu
Respectfully submitted to Lord Etsukuda Heibei

The above instructions are to be carried out as requested.

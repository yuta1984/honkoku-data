○【Red ink】Twenty-six　Record of Official Instructions

Regarding the petition submitted by the aforementioned affiliated post-horse station cooperative villages, on the 4th day of the 5th month of the Horse year, Gotō Shōsuke appeared at the Naka District Magistrate's office upon being summoned, where Deputy Kimura Gorokichi conveyed the following instructions: After unanimous deliberation regarding the aforementioned petition, while the petition regarding the irregular post-horse route assignment is quite reasonable, since the southern route takes two days and the northern route takes three days, the intention is that other routine official business shall henceforth be assigned to the northern route.

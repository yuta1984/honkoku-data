Although it has not been many years since the tax levy (bu-gake) was last collected, given the extremely dire financial circumstances with no other recourse available, after repeated deliberations, it has unavoidably been declared that a three-and-a-half bu levy shall be imposed.

Regarding this matter, all members of the retainer band (go-kachū) shall take note and, during the designated period, shall observe even greater frugality and economy while continuing their loyal service. Accordingly, the collection method shall be a mandatory three-and-a-half bu levy for a full three years from this autumn until the summer of the coming Year of the Dog. However, for those without stipends (mu-ashi), it shall be imposed at the rate of sixty me of rice and thirty me of barley, based on the precedent from the recent Year of the Horse. Furthermore, during the designated period, the repayment of extraordinary loans at the one bu high-rank levy rate shall be suspended, and the retainers' service silver, agricultural promotion funds, and well-related allocated rice shall be collected proportionally.

Regarding this matter, each shall receive notification to pass on to all members of the retainer band, as well as to the residents of Ōsato, Ikeda, and the three notable families respectively, and it should be communicated to their subordinates as well. For Kyoto and Osaka, this should be communicated to the residents there and others who receive stipends and assistance, and this should be relayed to the respective deputy governors (go-rusu-i). Moreover, for temples and shrines that receive land grants, as well as town magistrates and district governors, those who receive temple lands, townspeople's stipends, rural small-scale holdings, newly cultivated lands, and land grants, as well as all others with minor allocations, shall likewise have their grants reduced.

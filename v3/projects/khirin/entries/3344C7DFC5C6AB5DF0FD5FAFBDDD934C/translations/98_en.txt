One: When going out for farming work and accidentally finding and picking up items, later
　when there are official visits, bringing them out to their respective houses without discrimination
　—this type of behavior appears to be reasonable conduct
One: There are also occasionally those who, not avoiding the arrow tips, hide in willow groves and such places
　and pick up fallen items
　　However, this type of behavior is extremely dangerous. Nevertheless, regarding this matter,
　　there may also be people from other schools who have deep intentions to steal secret techniques,
　　which is difficult to measure, and while peasants generally do not think of such things,
　　it would be truly dangerous if there were those with misguided understanding
One: Recently, artillery practice is also conducted occasionally
　These projectiles, when fired toward targets like the artillery manuals of our school mentioned the other day,
　exploded where the projectile landed, so if one were present in that area,
　one would certainly face mortal danger, therefore this should be understood in advance
　and with careful attention, this should be communicated as Shosuke's cautionary instruction
　The previous types of behavior were also dangerous acts, but
　while they had been manageable until now, since artillery (practice) has begun, it is inappropriate

Copy of the Official Proclamation Regarding Dress Regulations
○【Red ink】
Sixty-six
Although repeated notifications and determinations have been issued regarding frugality, economy, and dress regulations, in recent years it appears that considerable expenditure to other provinces is not insignificant, and with such expenses, it is incalculable that the gradual decline of national strength may result. Should this occur, there would be nothing but trouble and hardship. However, when calculating the amount of money spent on procuring various goods from the Kamigata region, it is reported to be a considerable sum. Therefore, by establishing regulations to prevent inappropriate buying and selling, this would result in a general reduction of expenditure, and first and foremost, prevent those of inappropriate status from using official dress. The intent is that frugality and economy should naturally be practiced in moderation. Accordingly, both the city districts and Tomioka Shikenya-machi are ordered to establish regulations against inappropriate buying and selling. Therefore, understanding this directive, ensure there are no omissions, communicate this to each respective party, establish thorough regulations, and submit the collected written acknowledgments. The above.

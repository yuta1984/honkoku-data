Regarding various festival matters, we have been accepting petitions and processing applications in response to requests submitted from time to time until now. However, due to consecutive poor harvests in recent years, everyone has fallen into hardship, and petitions have appeared rather few at first. But regarding this year's situation, it has been generally a good harvest, and there are many who apply for earth god festivals or donations. Among these, there are some who act only for appearance's sake, disregarding village expenses and indulging solely in pursuit of profit, as we have heard. Naturally, some become caught up in petitions, and there are rumors that those who lack proper judgment do not heed the instructions of officials, which is quite problematic. Of course, given this year's circumstances, petitions submitted with the village's celebratory spirit are reasonable and appropriate. However, we hear that there are some improper behaviors as mentioned above, which is inappropriate. Therefore, the group leaders, village headmen, and rural inspectors should keep this well in mind. Not only should they refrain from initiating anything without proper petitions, but even when petitions are submitted, they should promptly stop any improper petition methods or inappropriate matters. To ensure such things do not happen in the future, they should kindly instruct village officials and others, and rural inspectors should patrol from time to time to thoroughly investigate and prevent any misconduct due to misunderstanding.

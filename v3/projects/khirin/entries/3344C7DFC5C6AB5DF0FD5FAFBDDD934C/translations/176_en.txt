On the 29th day of the first month, the verbal instructions from the District Magistrate were conveyed from Takai Yoshi to Matsue Shimasan as follows:

When disputes in this matter reach resolution, the parties involved should immediately settle their affairs at their lodgings first, and the official policy regarding this approval will be announced later. If this is not done, the disputing parties will likely suffer inconvenience, so arrangements should be made accordingly, and instructions were given to communicate to fellow officials in the district that a complete record of the resolution should be submitted later. This communication to fellow officials was carried out promptly.

○【Red notation】Twelve　Kōka 1st year, 8th month, 9th day　Document regarding the directive on Jimyōin temple solicitation

Regarding the matter of Jimyōin temple's direct solicitation, having consulted with the group heads and village headmen about the solicitation method, we first discussed the following matters with Oe, Awa, Myōdō, Myōsai, and Otesaki. Among those who conduct indigo sales through the indigo bed inspection officials, or those who communicate with procurement officials (possibly private use), there are group leaders and village headmen among the bed inspection officials. For these individuals, regarding Itano District, should Yamada Hanbē, Tada Tōemon, and Kondō Shōsaku be ordered to communicate accordingly? We have discussed that other Otesaki matters should be handled similarly, and therefore we humbly inquire about this matter.

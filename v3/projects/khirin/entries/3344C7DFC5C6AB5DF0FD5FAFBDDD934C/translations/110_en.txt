Regarding the matter of frugality, economy, and official dress regulations for all retainers of the domain, although directives have been issued repeatedly since previous years, it appears that some have become lax due to the recent trend toward extravagance in society, which is particularly troubling and shows poor understanding. Therefore, henceforth, not only official dress regulations but also frugality and economy must be observed. Should there be any who fail to understand this properly and investigations become necessary, it would first be most regrettable and inappropriate. Therefore, keep this matter thoroughly in mind and continue to pay attention to military preparedness in the future. Also, regarding the townspeople and villagers, notifications will be issued as stated in the separate document, so retainers must carefully instruct their servants in accordance with these guidelines without negligence.
Furthermore, the three samurai named Ikeda residing in Osato should also be informed without fail, and they should be told to communicate this to those under their supervision. Since this matter will not be made into a general proclamation, each person should call together two or three people in various islands and add earnest speeches so that none will misunderstand. This should be communicated by the inspectors (metsuke).

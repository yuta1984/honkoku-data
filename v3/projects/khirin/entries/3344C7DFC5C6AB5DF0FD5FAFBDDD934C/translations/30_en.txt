○ [Written in red ink] Seven: Copy of orders conveyed through an official note
Regarding last year's circumstances, it has been reported that various stipend recipients' annual taxes were not properly paid. Accordingly, orders have been issued from Edo directing the magistrate to pay attention and take care of this matter. With this understanding, if there are stipend recipients who fail to pay their annual taxes, village officials should pay attention and take care of such matters. This has been communicated to village officials in all villages.

○ [Written in red ink] Eight: The following has been communicated from headquarters today, and we hereby circulate this notice. The above.
Regarding annual taxes: In recent years, due to consecutive poor harvests, tax payments have been delayed well past the prescribed dates, sometimes extending until the end of the month. However, regarding this autumn's harvest, it is reported that it was a good year with sufficient yields. Therefore, orders have been given that this autumn's annual taxes must be completed by the prescribed date as in previous years, and this matter must be firmly resolved. Since such instructions have been issued for your understanding, we circulate this notice. Please acknowledge and circulate this accordingly.

Directive Speech to Group Heads and Village Headmen
○【Red ink】Sixty-eight
Regarding the current Tezaki matter, since the land base is a location under the jurisdiction of the mountain foothills and is exceptionally busy, various incoming and outgoing goods are directed to the port, which may cause trouble for the common people below. After considering the handling arrangements, this eighth month saw the insertion of personnel rotation records for Tezaki, making matters even more complicated. Already since the eighth month, petitions for one month have reached one hundred documents, and in response, temporary official duties have become numerous. Although we have ordered the clerks to work early shifts uniformly and have been conducting frequent investigations, there are no remaining days this year to begin handling the matters at the government office. Furthermore, regarding the legal matters to be handed over to you, while arrangements can mostly be made, the situation appears to be the same as before, likely causing trouble for the common people below. Therefore, we are making repeated arrangements for the handling methods, but since the clerks are few in number at this location and official duties have been exceptionally busy recently, the handling of the accumulated legal matters will extend even into next spring.

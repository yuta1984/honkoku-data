Thirty-two　　　　　　　　　　　　【With attached note】
Recently Western learning has become popular, and as people favor novelties,
those who prefer heterodox learning, without deeply researching such studies,
handle Dutch books and make conjectural and careless translations,
advocating strange theories and bizarre arguments, which we often hear about. Ultimately, recently
the matter of translating Dutch books into Japanese has become arbitrary, so such things
happening is quite problematic. Originally, Dutch books are meant to be
understood through translation, so if such questionable translations are circulated
and there are those who are mistaken in their understanding and believe only in such theories single-mindedly,
we cannot say what harmful effects might arise in the future.
Moreover, medical practice and such are similar matters. Therefore, from now on,
all book titles of Dutch books brought over must be reported to the Nagasaki Magistrate's Office,
and those approved by the magistrate's office may be
circulated to the public without problem. Henceforth, should there be anyone
who handles Dutch books omitted from the above report or privately translates them,
such books will be confiscated and the person in question will definitely
be subject to investigation. Regarding this matter, even those with stipends of over 10,000 koku who translate Dutch books
for the purpose of understanding western coastal defense, etc.,
should record the book titles and report them to the rōjū (senior councilors) first, and
once translation is completed, submit one copy to the Astronomy Office. The above.

Seventy
I hereby inform you by letter. From this winter for three years, a tax rate of 3.5 bu per unit will be collected, and those local officials who have been assigned this duty shall collect it at their respective offices and complete the accounting. The general amount is approximately 17,000 koku in total, with various separate assessments to be collected diligently within the year, similar to regular annual tribute. However, this affects all stipend holders' tribute payments, and stipend recipients have submitted various complaints about their difficulties and troubles regarding where this will lead. Given that we are undertaking the collection of such large amounts in stepped taxes, we cannot adequately address these concerns, and the stipend collection naturally becomes lax, with arrears increasing further. Among them, some have reportedly reached situations where their livelihood is severely affected. Furthermore, frequent collections from stipend holders regarding the stepped taxes have increased, and if the county magistrate's office also frequently collects stepped tax rice and barley in the same manner as regular tribute, it would lead to the impoverishment of small farmers and could result in unforeseeable difficulties. Therefore, for this matter, by special arrangement, rice shall be collected by the March deadline of the following year, and barley by the August deadline.

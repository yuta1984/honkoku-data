Thank you for informing us of your intentions through your letter. Although the cold has been quite severe recently,
we hope that you are all in increasingly good health, and we offer our congratulations.
Now, today when we were summoned, I and the instructors reported for duty, whereupon
we were ordered by Mr. Misawa Shuntaro to be given the written directive as noted below,
and we were ordered to communicate this to all of you through me.
Please acknowledge this and kindly consider
communicating this to the instructors in your group villages in due order.
Therefore, I have copied the separate written directive below

I write to inform you of the above matter. Hastily written. The above.

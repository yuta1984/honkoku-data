Petition Memorandum

Regarding the various legal disputes for which temporary procedures were ordered from the 21st day of the 1st month to the last day of the 2nd month of this year: among these cases, there are matters that we have handled but could not resolve, leading to various deadlocks, as well as cases for which procedures have not yet been arranged. As the deadline has expired, we are returning these cases. We humbly acknowledge that we have been ordered to consult among the respective procedure handlers and submit our opinions.

Furthermore, we truly appreciate and understand the value of this temporary procedure system. However, regarding the remaining disputants, although they have earnestly confined themselves within the previously announced temporary procedures, the deadline has expired, and they have unavoidably fallen behind schedule, causing them distress. Since the involvement cannot be resolved uniformly, would it be appropriate to order that these remaining dispute cases be transferred once more to our fellow officials within the district?

If such an order were to be issued, we would commence immediately from this time. Since the busy farming season will begin in about twenty days from now, we would work diligently until then, and for matters that cannot be resolved by that time, would it be appropriate to order that we submit detailed inquiries at that time?

In any case, our district differs from other districts in having many various disputes, so unless we work intensively to handle cases and reduce their number, the petitioners will suffer hardship...

First, without the above [measures], the peasants would forget their primary duty.

First, this is a time of great expenditure, and particularly an act of mercy unprecedented since ancient times. Although rice and grain prices are high, [the message] should be communicated to the peasants in such a way that they truly feel grateful to the depths of their hearts.

First, [they should be told] that this will not be something that will continue in future years.

I humbly request that such arrangements be added to the official document.

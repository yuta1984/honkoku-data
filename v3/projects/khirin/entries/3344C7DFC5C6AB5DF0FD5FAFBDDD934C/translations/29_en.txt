Copy of the above directive

Regarding the above matter: It was previously ordered that frugality should be practiced until this fifth month, and furthermore, we should continue to observe the same practices as before. The magistrate orally conveyed the benevolent directive, instructing us to practice frugality with provisions, keeping in mind these gracious intentions. We humbly received this instruction. When we carefully explained this to all the small farmers in our villages, they all expressed that they deeply appreciate and humbly accept the directive. We then collected individual written acknowledgments and keep them in our records. Therefore, we submit this collective acknowledgment with joint signatures, and there are absolutely no discrepancies. The above.

This is something we wish to ensure is thoroughly implemented. Therefore, it has been ordered that approximately six to seven parts of the initial public works silver be distributed, and the remaining silver shall be paid out all at once depending on the progress of the public works. Everyone should truly be grateful for this consideration, so when the public works magistrate visits from time to time, he should be entertained with whatever food is available, and there should be no inappropriate conduct.

Since there is such generous consideration from above, by the will of the magistrate, it has been ordered that those living in reasonable circumstances should be encouraged to contribute a small amount of labor through their own efforts to assist with the public works. This directive has been thoroughly communicated to the village officials. Since the senior officials must understand this intention, we wish to directly inform those who have come today.

Furthermore, this was later proclaimed to the village officials and village headmen at the government office.

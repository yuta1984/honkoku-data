Memorandum

Tomorrow, the 2nd day, is a "shajitsu" (seasonal festival day), which is a rest day for the first ancestral deity of agricultural work in our village district. On this day, everyone performs ritual ceremonies and visits shrines for worship. Therefore, we would like to make this day a rest day for the current proceedings. We humbly request that you submit this matter upward for approval in this manner.

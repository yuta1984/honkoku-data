Due to various directives from the financial office (okatte-kata), all members of the retainer band have been ordered to accept salary reductions (ayu-gakari) until next year, the year of the Rooster. Of course, as previously ordered, these were to be lifted next summer, but due to the current request for assistance (financial support), the salary reductions will be extended for another year. Although there have been deliberations beginning with the current officials, since everyone has been greatly troubled by the salary reductions imposed year after year, deep consideration has been given and various adjustments have been ordered. As definitively announced, the reductions will be lifted next summer. Regarding this matter, everyone should understand this thoroughly and maintain even stricter frugality and economy during the period of salary reductions. Recently, it appears that some people's attitudes have gradually become lax. Since such laxity regarding what has been earnestly announced would be utterly inappropriate for one's station and quite problematic, understanding these points and keeping them firmly in mind, and since only a short time remains, special supervision should be maintained.

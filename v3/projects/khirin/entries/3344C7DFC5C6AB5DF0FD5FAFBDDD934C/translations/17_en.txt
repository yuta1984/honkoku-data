First, regarding the annual tribute: after deducting miscellaneous grain continuation rice and the rice allowance for village headmen, the number of people granted a two-bu rate payment extension until April next year shall be determined and ordered.
　However, concerning the promissory notes for official funds, since these are sold separately from one's own annual tribute, if new treasury procurement orders are issued in the same manner, it would create confusion in the accounts and not be uniform, which would be inconvenient.

First, although the two-bu rate payment extension has been announced to everyone, those with adequate assets should make full payment and provide assistance to small farmers and the poor. Privately, extensions of two-bu, three-bu, or even half amounts until next summer may occur. We believe it would be acceptable if the total settlement achieves the two-bu rate payment.

We have reviewed this matter. Regarding the annual conditions, we understand that dry field farming villages are in distress with no alternatives other than purchased rice, but as a special measure, for this time only, we acknowledge the proposals regarding using Awaji rice for annual tax payments and stipend recipient fees, as well as matters concerning approval procedures, as submitted. We hereby communicate this matter. Additionally, we direct that this matter also be communicated to the granary magistrates through the head administrators.

as false and had Bian He's left foot cut off. He also presented it to King Wu of Chu. King Wu had many jade craftsmen examine it, and all said it was stone. King Wu also had Bian He's right foot cut off. Bian He wept blood and said, "There is no one in the world who recognizes a bright pearl, and they treat a loyal gentleman as a deceiver." He embraced the raw jade and hid at the foot of Mount Jing. Later he again presented it to King Wen of Chu. King Wen selected jade craftsmen to polish it, and indeed it emitted brilliant light, illuminating the dark night like daytime. Therefore it was named the Night-Shining Jade Bi of Chu. When King Huiwen of Zhao held a gathering of feudal lords, he obtained this from the King of Chu. Later, when Qin unified the realm and ascended to the imperial throne, this jade bi became what is known as the Imperial Jade Seal for transmitting the dynasty - this refers to this very jade.
The King of Qin again wished to meet with the King of Zhao at Mianchi in Xihe. The King of Zhao, accompanied by Lin Xiangru, arrived at Mianchi and met with the King of Qin.

The King of Qin ultimately gained no victory over Zhao.

Solely praising Lin Xiangru's great merit, he made him Senior Minister and placed his rank above that of Lian Po. Lian Po said, "I am Zhao's great general who has attacked cities and fought in the field, laboring my body and achieving great merit. Lin Xiangru merely through eloquence has been placed in rank above me. Moreover, Lin Xiangru was originally a retainer of Miao Xian. I am ashamed to be placed below him.

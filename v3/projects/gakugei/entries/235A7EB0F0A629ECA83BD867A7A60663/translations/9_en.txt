　　　Confucius explains about the seeds of duckweed, as well as Yan Hui's benevolence and integrity
King Zhao of Chu wished to honor the wise, recruit scholars, strengthen his military, and achieve hegemony. His retainer Zhu Liang said, "Kong Zhongni of Lu is the sage of our time. In the past, when the Duke of Lu employed him, the state of Lu was greatly governed, and territory invaded by Qi was recovered. Now he travels among the states and is in Jin. If Your Majesty truly considers achieving hegemony, please welcome him and entrust him with the governance of the state." Zong Mu said, "Kong Qiu is an impractical scholar who does not understand current affairs." King Zhao said, "I picked up an object at Jiangzhou. None of my ministers know its name. It is said that sages have holes in their hearts and know things that people do not know, so I will send an envoy to ask the name of that object and test him." He had Zong Mu carry the object to meet Confucius and question him. When Confucius saw the object, it was round, large, and had light. Confucius said, "This is the seed of duckweed. If eaten, its taste is sweet like honey." Zong Mu bowed, took his leave, returned, and reported to King Zhao. The king split it and gave it to his ministers. When they ate it, it was indeed like honey. King Zhao immediately sent a comfortable carriage with four horses to welcome Confucius.

said, "If Chu employs Confucius and achieves hegemony, our small states will be in danger. We must simply prevent Confucius from entering Chu." They suddenly raised troops and surrounded Confucius. When Zilu became angry and took up a halberd to fight, Confucius said, "A gentleman blames himself, not others. How could one cultivate benevolence and righteousness yet fight and quarrel with the vulgar world?" He played the qin and sang. The troops of Chen and Cai did not withdraw for seven days. Food ran out and the disciples became hungry and exhausted. Zigong took out the goods he had wrapped and secretly told a countryman, obtaining one bushel of rice. When Yan Yuan was cooking it, dust fell into the rice. Yan Hui picked it out and ate it. Zigong saw this from beside the well and thought he was stealing food. He told Confucius that Yan Yuan had eaten the rice and said, "Do even benevolent people and honest scholars change their principles when in dire straits?" Confucius said, "I have long trusted Yan Hui's benevolence. There must be a reason for this." He called Yan Hui and said, "Yesterday I saw my ancestors in a dream. I want to make offerings to them. Present the rice you have cooked." Yan Hui said, "Earlier, dust fell into the rice. To leave it would be unclean, and to throw it away would be wasteful, so Yan Hui ate it. It should not be used for offerings." Confucius said, "Then I too will eat it." After Yan Hui left, Confucius said, "My trust in Yan Hui is not just from today." Zigong heard this and was convinced.

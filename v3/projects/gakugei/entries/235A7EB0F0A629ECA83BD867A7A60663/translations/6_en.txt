King Fucha of Wu playing with Xi Shi at the Eight Scenic Spots

King Wu subjugated Chu and Yue, and with a peaceful mind built Gusu Terrace for recreation. Its height allowed one to see for three hundred li, and its width could accommodate six thousand people. The beams were carved with sculptures, the rafters painted with pictures, the pillars decorated with gold, and the railings made of jade. In the garden, beautiful flowers and plants were planted, rare birds and beasts were released, lake water was drawn to surround the front of the terrace, and ornately decorated boats were floated. On the left was Fragrant Water Valley, and on the right was Hundred Flowers Isle. The fragrance of flowers never ceased throughout the four seasons. This terrace was completed by accumulating three years' worth of wealth and gathering five years' worth of labor. The king came out to this terrace daily to play, arranging dozens of beautiful women beside his seat to sing and dance. At that time, Xi Shi was the foremost among them. Her beautiful appearance was incomparable, and the king's favor for her surpassed that for his empress and consorts. He also built Xi Shi Cave on Lingyan Mountain, opened Flower Appreciation Pool, created Fragrance Gathering Path, dug Jade Spring Well, built Guanwa Palace, and took Xi Shi with him, having his consorts escort them front and rear to play at the Eight Scenic Spots (the Eight Scenic Spots are: Gusu Terrace, Hundred Flowers Isle, Fragrant Water Valley, Xi Shi Cave, Flower Appreciation Pool, Fragrance Gathering Path, Jade Spring Well, and Guanwa Palace). Every fifty steps there was a pavilion, every eighty steps a tower, and at each pavilion they held banquets, at each tower they performed songs and dances. In spring, they searched for hundreds of flowers in all directions,

picked flower branches and inserted them in Xi Shi's hair, saying: "If I stood under a cluster of hundreds of flowers on a moonlit night, I would not know that the appearance of flowers resembles you, and your appearance resembles flowers." In summer, they loaded flutes and drums on numerous boats, admired lotus flowers with Xi Shi at Fragrant Water Valley, and had palace ladies pick lotus flowers. Xi Shi also tried to pick lotus flowers but accidentally fell into the valley stream. Many palace ladies entered the water to help her up, and the king himself embraced her in the boat, saying: "Xi Shi's appearance when drowning is like fallen flowers drifting on water." He also spread white pearls in the valley, drew clear water for bathing with Xi Shi. In autumn, he climbed Lingyan Mountain with Xi Shi to seek autumn leaves, resided in Guanwa Palace playing songs, dances, and stringed instruments day and night. In winter, on frosty mornings and snowy nights, the king wore fox fur robes with Xi Shi, had dozens of palace ladies pull carts to seek plum blossoms. From this time on, King Wu ceased governing state affairs, specializing in banquets and debauchery day and night. All state administration fell into ruin. Wu Zixu prepared memorials to remonstrate, but the king completely refused to accept them. Zixu withdrew and lamented, saying: "The end of Wu is like the reigns of Kings Jie and Zhou. How can it avoid destruction?" Later, it was indeed destroyed by King Goujian of Yue.

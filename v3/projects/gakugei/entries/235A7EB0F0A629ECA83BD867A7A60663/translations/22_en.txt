One day, when Lin Xiangru went out and saw Lian Po coming, he had his carriage turned around to avoid and hide from him. Lin Xiangru's retainers remonstrated, saying, "We serve you because we admire your high righteousness. Now when Lian Po speaks ill of you, why do you avoid and hide from him with such extreme fear?" Lin Xiangru said, "I did not cower even before the King of Qin and humiliated him and his ministers. Why should I now fear General Lian? I believe that the reason the strong armies of Qin are not brought against Zhao is because both Lian Po and I are here. If we two were to fight and quarrel now, we would both die from the conflict. My acting in this way puts the urgent needs of the state first and personal grudges last." When Lian Po heard this reported to him, he was greatly ashamed. He went to Lin Xiangru's gate, bared his torso, and carried a bundle of switches on his back to apologize for his offense. Finally, they rejoiced together and formed a bond of shared life and death.

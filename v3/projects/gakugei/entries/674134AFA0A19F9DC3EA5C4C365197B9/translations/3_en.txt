First Month (January)

Ki no Tsurayuki
My sleeves are wet
from scooping up the clear water—
now frozen solid.
Will today's spring wind
melt it away?

Second Month (February)

Archbishop Henjō
Light green
threads hanging down with white dew
strung like jewels—
is this the spring willow?

Third Month (March)

Ariwara no Narihira
If it doesn't come today,
tomorrow snow would
surely fall—
even if it doesn't melt,
I would see it as cherry blossoms

Fourth Month (April) - Anonymous

On my sleeves lingers
the scent of someone
from long ago—
the orange blossoms
await the fifth month

Fifth Month (May)

In the May rains
the sky also
thunders—
cuckoo,
what sadness makes you
cry alone through the night? —Tsurayuki

Sixth Month

Mitsune
Between summer and autumn
traveling back and forth
across the sky's
pathway—
on one side a cool
wind must be
blowing

Seventh Month

Tomonori
Following
the shallow rapids and white waves
of the Milky Way,
if I finish crossing,
dawn will have
died

Eighth Month - Anonymous

Against white clouds
wings
beating
in formation—
even the number of flying geese
can be seen
in the autumn
night moon

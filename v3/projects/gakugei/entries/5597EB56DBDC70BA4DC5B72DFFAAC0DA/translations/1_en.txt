The Emperor ordered Kobo Daishi (Kukai) to write a plaque for Kongodoji Temple, and sent an imperial messenger to Mount Takao to have it dedicated. It happened to be a day of continuous rain, and the waters of Kiyotaki River had risen tremendously, flooding the banks so that crossing was impossible. As the messenger was troubled about what to do, Kobo Daishi faintly heard of this matter and came out to the western bank of the river. The imperial messenger stood on the eastern bank holding up the plaque. Across the distant river surface, the master took a large brush, filled it with ink, and wrote toward the plaque. Mysteriously, the ink became like mist and fell upon the surface of the plaque on the opposite side, with the dots of hanging dew appearing vividly, and the force of "entering wood" remaining steady and composed.

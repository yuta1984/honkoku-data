○Clouds are the qi of mountains and rivers. Earth qi rises to become clouds, and heaven qi descends to become rain. Clouds have yin nature and rise to become yang function. All are qi of rain and moisture.

○Rain is water that evaporates to become clouds and descends as rain. Sudden rain is called bōu (violent rain), prolonged rain is called rin'u (continuous rain), evening showers are called shūu (swift rain), and seasonal rain is called shū.

○Thunder is the sound of yin and yang clashing violently. In Wang Chong's "Lunheng" (Balanced Inquiries), it describes thunder's form as a strongman holding numerous drums in his left hand and a whip in his right hand, striking to make sound.

○Lightning occurs in the second month. In this month, yang qi gradually becomes vigorous and strikes yin qi. This intense light is called den. It is commonly called inabikari or inazuma. The thunder god is called denbo (lightning mother).

○Halos are qi around the sun and moon, called "kasa." When the sun has a halo, there will be drought; when the moon has a halo, rain will fall within three days.

○Snow is rain that freezes to become snow. The accumulated yin qi of heaven and earth becomes rain when warm and snow when cold. What forms flowers is called snow, and what is round is called hail. It is also called silver flowers, six-petaled flowers, or silver flakes.

○Ice forms where yin qi gathers without leaking, binding together to become ice. Writing it as "氷 (hyō)" is incorrect; it should be written as "冰 (hyō)." Accumulated ice is called ryō, vigorous ice is called tō, flowing ice is called shi, and melting ice is called han. An ice house is called "himuro."

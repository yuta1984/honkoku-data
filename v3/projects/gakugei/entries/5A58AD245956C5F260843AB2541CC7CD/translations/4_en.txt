○The Sun is the essence of yang. Being ethereal and difficult to represent in form, a crow is used to symbolize the sun's shape, as it is a yang bird. The three legs represent the concept of yang numbers (odd numbers).

○The Moon is the essence of yin. Being ethereal and difficult to represent in form, a rabbit is used to symbolize the moon's shape, as the rabbit is a yin animal. The white rabbit represents the color of yin.

○Hokushin (North Star) is also called the North Pole and is the pivot of heaven. The complete rotation of heaven revolves around this North Star as its central axis. Located in the north, all stars face toward it. In the constellation of the North Star there are seven stars and four stars.

○Retsu-shuku (Lunar Mansions): These stars are positioned in the east, west, south, and north of heaven, with seven stars in each of the four directions. Together they make twenty-eight mansions. These are distributed over thirty days to govern each day.

○Kai (New Moon): Each month, if it's a long month it's the 30th day, if it's a short month it's the 29th day that is called kai. The moon is hidden underground with no light, so the character kai is read as "kurashi" (darkness). It means twilight darkness and deep darkness.

○Saku means "revival" and is read as "yomigaeru" (to be reborn). The moon wanes from the 15th day until the end of the month, then revives again from the 1st day (ついたち) and begins to generate light, hence it is called saku.

○Gen (Quarter): The 15th day of the first half is called jōgen (first quarter), and the 15th day of the second half is called gegen (last quarter). The first quarter is in the west, the last quarter is in the east. The first quarter occurs on the 7th, 8th, and 9th days, the last quarter on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th days. The moon's light appears sideways.

○Bō refers to the 15th day. On the 15th day, the sun and moon face each other from east to west, hence it is called bō (望, to face/look at). It is also called mochizuki (full moon).

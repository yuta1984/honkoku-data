○Taiji (the Supreme Ultimate) refers to when heaven and earth had not yet separated and yin and yang were undivided - a chaotic state like a chicken egg. Dark and containing a sprout within. This is called the "undifferentiated primordial vastness." That which was pure and clear spread thinly to become heaven, while that which was heavy and turbid remained stagnant to become earth. Thus heaven and earth separated, and between them all things were born. The time before this separation is called Taiji, and when heaven and earth, yin and yang separated, it is called the Two Principles.

In China, after heaven and earth separated, Pangu emerged first. This was the beginning of humanity. From this point, the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings continued, leading to the human age.
○Yamato: Regarding calling Japan "Yamato," after heaven and earth separated, the land was all mountains with no flat areas. When the human age came, people opened up the mountains and made them into flat land to live on. Therefore, Japan is called Yamato-koku with the meaning of "mountain traces."

　　　　Uta-gai (Poetry Shells) 《Also called uta-karuta or tsukimatsu-tori》
Uta-gai refers to what is now called uta-karuta (poetry cards). The era when it began is not certain. In a certain book, when Ariwara no Narihira went to Ise Province as an imperial messenger, Princess Teishi was serving at the Itsuki-no-miya shrine, and she wrote the upper verse of a poem on a sake cup and presented it. Narihira immediately took charcoal from a torch fire where pine torches had been burned and wrote the lower verse in continuation, as seen in the Ise Monogatari (Tales of Ise). From this, it was transferred to karuta and became a form of entertainment. Due to the connection of writing the lower verse with charcoal from pine torches, taking uta-gai came to be called tsukimatsu-tori (taking pine torches). Also, something similar to this appears in the Shūi-shū, where a certain woman sent the upper verse of a poem, and Yoshimine no Munesada replied with the lower verse.

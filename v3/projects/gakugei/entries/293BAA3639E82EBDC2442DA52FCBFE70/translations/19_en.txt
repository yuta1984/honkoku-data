When composing poetry, one should use ancient words to express one's thoughts in sequence. Even if a poem is interesting, new words are disliked. Books that collect and annotate poetic vocabulary include "Yakumo Misho," "Moshiogusa," "Yusai Kikigaki," "Zenshu," "Shogaku Wakashiki," and "Waka Yaegaki."

There are themes called "single-character themes" - pine, bamboo, peak, river, and such. There are "compound themes" such as "longing for a friend before the moon" and "making the pine a lasting friend." There are also themes from Buddhist scriptures.

There are "reply poems." These refer to composing a poem in response to one received from another person.

These are detailed in works like "Yakumo Misho," "Uta-makura," "Aki no Nezame," and "Meisho Buruiko."

There is something called "grouped themes."

When combining five autumn poems: autumn colors, autumn sounds, autumn fragrances, autumn emotions, autumn love, and such. When combining two poems of the four seasons: spring view of waterside villages, autumn journey on mountain paths, and such. These appear in the "Waka Kumidai-shu."

If anyone has the aspiration to compose poetry in sequence, they should first read books on how to compose poetry and books with vocabulary collections about ten times, and then

There is also the "Mana Ise Monogatari" by Prince Rokujō. It is written in Chinese characters with kana reading marks attached. This is said to have been created by the later Chūsho-ō.

"Yamato Monogatari" is said to have been written by Ariwara no Shigeharu. Shigeharu was Narihira's second son, also called Zaishi-kun. Alternatively, it is also said to be a creation of Emperor Kazan. A commentary on this tale was written by Kitamura Kigin.

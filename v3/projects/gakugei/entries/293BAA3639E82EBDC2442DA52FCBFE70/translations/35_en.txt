The method of writing records is: first write "Record of Ten Burnings Incense," then mark the tally symbols as Blue Pine, Red Plum, Yellow Leaf, etc., adding the name beside it. Below that, write the number each person guessed correctly, counting from the top and recording how many. If there are noble persons, record how many types. Finally, write the date and record the host's name below.

The author of "The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter" is not certain. It is also said to have been written by Minamoto no Shitagau. In the "Picture Competition" chapter of "The Tale of Genji," it is written that the Bamboo Cutter, who is the ancestor of all tale beginnings, competes with Toshikage from "Utsubo Monogatari," which refers to this tale. Also, what is composed about young herbs (wakana) in the "Man'yōshū" is said not to refer to this tale.

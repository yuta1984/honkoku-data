Among these fifty-four chapters, there are books that annotate the costumes and dress, such as "Gengo Sōzoku-shō" (Commentary on Genji Costumes) and "Nannyo Sōzoku-shō" (Commentary on Men's and Women's Costumes).

"Sagoromo" was written by a woman called Daini Sanmi. It is said to have been created in imitation of "The Tale of Genji." Since this Daini Sanmi was the daughter of Murasaki Shikibu, it would not be inferior to "The Tale of Genji" in the least. Among the books that provide commentary on this work, there is one called "Shitahimo" (Lower Cord). There is also a genealogical chart. The genealogical chart is said to have been created by Lord Shōyō-in.

"The Tales of Ise" is called so because it was written by Lady Ise. It is also said that Ariwara no Narihira wrote it himself. According to one person's theory, there existed Narihira's own written manuscript, and Lady Ise added various things to it, making it into a work of fiction.

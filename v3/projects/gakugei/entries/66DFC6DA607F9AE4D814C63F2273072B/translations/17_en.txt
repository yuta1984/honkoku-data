《Small text: A temporary shrine was established as a resting place for the deity during processions. This festival originated on June 3rd of Tenbun 10 (1541), when a divine palanquin drifted down the Arakawa River to this place. Since then, this day has been observed as the festival day. The site where the divine palanquin was retrieved still exists today.》

《Small text: It is an old custom to use thatch grass that grows on that land to roof the temporary shrine. The festival of Asuka Myōjin is held annually on September 15th.》

Zuikō Stone (Stone of Auspicious Light) 《Small text: Located on a small mound to the right of the main shrine. Also called Kei Stone. In ancient times》
《Small text: It is said that two deities appeared in the form of old men on this stone. Upon consideration, this is probably an ancient burial mound.》

Hōtokusan Seigan-ji Temple - Called Eshin-in. Located north of Asuka Myōjin, it belongs to the Jōdo sect and enshrines Amida Buddha as its principal deity. The founder was the monk Eshin Sōzu.
According to temple records, the Sōzu mastered both esoteric and exoteric teachings, studied various sects, and eventually devoted himself to Amida's original vow, writing the "Ōjō Yōshū" and other works that greatly benefited himself and others. 《Small text: This was the beginning of nembutsu propagation in the present world.》 At that time, the Sōzu told his disciple, the priest Keiyū, that the teaching of nembutsu had not yet spread to the eastern provinces, and instructed him to go and propagate it. Therefore, priest Keiyū received this command, traveled to the eastern provinces for missionary work, came to this place, and established this temple. 《Small text: In comparison to Eshin-in in Uji, this temple was also named Eshin-in.》 When it fell into ruin in medieval times, it was restored by Zuiha Dai-oshō, the 18th abbot of Zōjō-ji Temple, Ryōrensha Jōyo Shōnin. 《Small text: In a book called "Shiojiri," there is recorded》
《Small text: A letter of admonition sent from Eshin Sōzu's mother to the Sōzu. Thinking this might serve as instruction for those who study Buddhism, I record it here. The text states》
《Small text: When Eshin Sōzu was summoned to court by imperial command and gave lectures on the Shōsan Jōdo Sutra, the emperor was so moved that he bestowed upon him a Buddhist statue and imperial robes. In reply to sending the imperial robes to his mother in his hometown, considering this an honor and joy》

《Small text: Heartlessly, she was rather resentful. In that letter》
《Small text: After you entered the mountain path, though day and night my longing broke my heart, I thought joyfully that I had made you into a venerable religious person. But now you attend the imperial court, advance in official rank, change your robe colors to blue and purple brocades, face the emperor, lecture on sutras, and receive offerings - becoming a monk obsessed with fame and profit. How regrettable! I had hoped that you would limit your life to dwelling under trees and on stones, exhausting your body with gathering grass and eating tree fruits, cutting wood and gathering fallen leaves, solely seeking salvation in the afterlife. Yet again you prosper, attending the royal palace, adorning yourself with various ranks and elaborate robes, preaching for fame and accepting offerings for profit. This is not at all the work of liberation, but merely becoming one trapped in samsara. Having encountered the rare Buddhist teaching and thinking you would be saved in the afterlife, how sad that you are deluded by temporary fame and profit. Among the foolish, this is particularly foolish and regrettable. To consider this honorable is base delusion. What use is it to be known by people equally deluded in this dream-world? Rather, perfect enlightenment in the eternal world and make your name before Buddha. Even wise men who do not know Buddhism withdrew to Shouyang Mountain and refused royal commands. How much more so should you, with your shaven head and dyed robes, who undertook the practice of abandoning the body as a mountain hermit, not be so entangled with imperial edicts or venture into places where men and women mingle? What arrangement led you to accept those imperial robes? Even properly practicing monks are said to burn in hell when struck down by offerings. What should this nun do with the imperial robes given as offerings for lecturing on the Shōsan Jōdo Sutra? Far from helping the afterlife, they would drag you down to the three evil paths - how unspeakably wretched. Thinking this might reach your ears, I return them to this priest. [Above is a summary in abbreviated form]》

《Small text: Ah, how wise was this old woman! Thus the Sōzu increasingly detested this world, deepened his aspiration for the Pure Land, composed the "Ōjō Yōshū," and benefited himself and others. Monks and priests of this degenerate age who personally approach powerful families and flatter them seeking fame and greedily pursuing profit - if they saw the traces of this old nun's brush, how could they not sweat with shame? Those without shame at this would be inferior even to beasts. The Sōzu was not originally a person of fame and profit; that he returned even gifts sent with filial devotion so coldly and gave such admonishment was an act that later generations could never match.》

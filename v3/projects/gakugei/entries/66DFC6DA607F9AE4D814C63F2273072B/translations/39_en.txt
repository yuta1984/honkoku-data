While the remaining soldiers held the vanguard, the day had already reached late afternoon (around 6 PM) and the deep and shallow parts of the river could no longer be distinguished. Therefore, Yoshimune could not continue crossing, and with no allies following behind, he gnashed his teeth saying "This is not easy" and retreated to the main camp. (The above follows the intent of the Taiheiki)

Sunao Fudō-in - Also called Hashiba Temple. Located to the right of the road, slightly south of the ferry crossing. It belongs to the Tendai sect and is affiliated with Sensō-ji Temple. (In ancient times it was of the Hossō sect, but during the time of head priest Kyōen, from the year of Chōkan Kinoe-Hitsuji [1163], the sectarian practices were changed.) In Hōki 4, year of Kinoto-Ushi (773), Jaku-shō, a leading disciple of the monk Rōben, founded this temple and enshrined a statue of Fudō Myōō as the principal deity.
According to the temple's origin story, the principal deity Fudō Myōō is one of three statues carved by the monk Rōben when he was at Ōyama Temple in Sagami Province, made from the same wood and in the same style as that temple's principal deity. The monk once told his leading disciple Master Jaku-shō: "Of the three statues, one shall remain at this mountain, one I shall keep for personal devotion. The remaining one I entrust to you. Install it wherever you find a spiritually connected place." Therefore, after the monk's death (he died in Hōki 4 at age 82), when Master Jaku-shō was traveling toward Kazusa, he happened to arrive at this place, received a divine revelation, and knowing it to be a spiritually connected place, installed it here. He consulted with village elders and local people to build a grass hall, calling it Sunao Fudō-son. The Sunao Yakushi Nyorai is located within the temple grounds, and the principal statue is

the work of the monk Eshin. (According to "Nankōtei Sawa," one theory states that in this place there was once a person called Sunao Shuri-no-Taiyu who fought against Ōta Dōkan. This is called the Battle of Ishihama. There is indeed a temple built by the Sunao clan)
(It is said to be a Tendai sect temple called Sunao-san Fudō-in, but the temple records do not mention the Shuri-no-Taiyu, and battles with Dōkan are not found in various books. This still requires further investigation)

Myōki-san Sōsen-ji - A Sōtō Zen temple and one of the three principal temples of Edo. The founding priest was called Kaku-sō Sōshun Oshō. This temple serves as the mortuary temple (kōke-in) for the Chiba family. (In Eiroku 2, the Odawara Hōjō family's property register lists "Eka temple of Ishihama in Bushū," which likely refers to this temple)

Chiba Clan Graves - Located among the egg-shaped pagodas in the temple grounds, carved only with Sanskrit characters on blue stones about three feet long, without noting years or posthumous names. The temple has what is called the memorial tablet of the great patron Chiba-no-suke Moritane, inscribed as "Sōsen-ji-den Chōzan Shōton Taiko-ji." According to the temple monks, Moritane died on the eighth day of the eleventh month of Kōji 3, year of Hinoto-Mi (1557), but there seem to be considerable discrepancies regarding the time of Moritane's death. Also, "Edo Sō-kanoko" records that Chiba-no-suke Tsunetane's grave marker reads "Shunjō-in-den Teishin Koji," and Chiba-no-suke Sadatane's grave marker reads "Sokushin Jifūryū," but their current locations are unknown. This requires further investigation at another time.

Grave of Utsunomiya Yasaburō Nyūdō - Also located among the egg-shaped pagodas, consisting of two blue stone monuments, one dated the twenty-first day of the eleventh month of Shōan 1 (1299), the other the seventh day of the second month of Tokuji 2, year of Hinoto-Hitsuji (1307).
(Upon consideration, the Utsunomiya Yasaburō spoken of in temple tradition is likely Yoritsuna Nyūdō Shisshin-bō. He also used the name Renshō. After listening to the teachings of Master Genkū, he became a monk under Master Zen'e. He died in Kyoto in the eleventh month of Shōgen 1, year of Tsuchinoto-Hitsuji (1259), and according to his will, his grave was built beside his master's stone pagoda, as recorded in Master Seizan's biography. That place is on the eastern slope of Sanko-ji Temple in Seizan, Kyoto. Therefore, I believe the ones at this temple are likely grave markers copied and erected by former branch family members who lived in this area. However, both Shōan and Tokuji postdate Shōgen by more than forty years. There are many suspicious points.)

In essence, this temple demonstrates the profound principles of the Shōbōgenzō and opens the mental seal of true form and formlessness, the single path of advancement

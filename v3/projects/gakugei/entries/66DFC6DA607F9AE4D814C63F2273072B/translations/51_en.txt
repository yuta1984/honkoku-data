Land was granted in all four directions, and this was named Yoshiwara-machi. According to records, what are now called Izumi-chō, Takasago-chō, Sumiyoshi-chō, Naniwa-chō, etc. are the sites of the former district. Also, Kikuoka Senryō states that the land was swampland where only reeds and miscanthus grew abundantly.
The land was developed, so it could have been called "Yoshihara" (Reed Plain), but this was changed to the auspicious "Yoshiwara" (Lucky Plain). According to some sources like "Shiseki Katsukō" and books such as "Edo Kanoko" published in the Genroku era, the name came from the original Yoshiwara in Suruga Province that was relocated here. The construction was
completed the following year. However, as Edo became increasingly prosperous and houses multiplied, in the winter of Meireki 2, land was finally granted at the present
location. In Meireki 3, year of the Rooster, in the 8th month, it moved to the current location. Thus it came to be called Shin-Yoshiwara-machi (New Yoshiwara District). This pleasure quarter is truly
the foremost of the three capitals. Its liveliness is particularly outstanding during the cherry blossom season of the third month, when a single moment of a spring evening is worth
a thousand pieces of gold. The early autumn lantern festival began with memorial services for Tamakiku of Manjiya, and the white layered kimono of Hassaku
originated with Takahashi of Tomoheya. Even today this day marks the seasonal clothing change. The famous twice-monthly moon viewing and
the golden age are beyond description. There is no time to enumerate all of its beauty, so we shall
omit it here for now.

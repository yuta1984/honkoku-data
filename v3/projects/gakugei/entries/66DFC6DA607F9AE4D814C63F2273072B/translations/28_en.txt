Lamenting the state of the world, he retired to Mino Province. Therefore, the Uesugi family granted Sanetane's succession to his elder brother Yoritane and appointed him as Chiba-no-suke. This lineage was called the Chiba of Musashi Province. <<The above follows the intent of the Kamakura Ōsōshi>>

According to the Nanchō Kiden, in the third month of Kōshō 2 (1456), year of hinoe-ne, the Chiba house also split in two due to the conflict between Shigeuji and Uesugi, and Koretane and a certain person from Onjō-ji proceeded to Musashi Province.

According to the poetry annotations of Baikamujinzō on the Sumida River from Bunmei hinoe-uma: "Sumida is located between Musashi and Shimōsa provinces. There are willows by small mounds along the roadside, where Lord Ōta Dōkan constructed three long bridges to attack the Chiba of Shimōsa."

The same book's poetry annotations state: "Eight scenic views or snow poems were dedicated to Chiba. Kazusa and Shimōsa were under Chiba's jurisdiction. Those now residing in Musashi opposed the Chiba of Kazusa and Shimōsa, dividing the clan in two. This refers to when Lord Dōkan was in Musashi:
'After snow, moon, blue lakes, and misty rain / Fishermen's songs and bell sounds send off flying geese
A single sail travels a thousand ri to the flower market / Kazusa and Shimōsa return to your grasp'
This likely refers to Chiba Koretane who resided in Musashi."

<<According to books such as the Kantō Kosen-roku and Odawara Jikki, Chiba Daisuke Mitsu-tane's illegitimate son, Mutsu-no-kami Yasutane, lord of Makuhari castle in northern Sōshū, fought for succession with his half-brother Koretane. Yasutane won and became the family head. Therefore, the elder retainer Onjō-ji Sama-no-suke Jirō took Koretane to Edo Castle and requested protection from Ōta Dōkan. Dōkan pitied this noble house's weak position and granted them Ishihama fortress to defend. Later, Koretane died, and his son Jirō Tanetoshi served Uesugi Tomooki for a while but was again driven out by southern forces and left Edo Castle. He later served under Hōjō Ujiyasu's banner, was granted lands near Ishihama, and passed the succession to Tanemune. However, in the eleventh month of Tenshō 1 (1573), when Lord Yoshiuji of Koga attacked Sekiyado castle in Shimōsa, Tanemune was killed in battle. Afterward, the Ishihama Chiba house had only daughters and no sons, so by Ujimasa's order, the third son of Hōjō Hitachi-no-suke Ujishige was adopted, married to that daughter, named Jirō Tanemura, and made to inherit the Chiba legacy. However, since he was still young, he was entrusted to someone called Kiuchi Kōzuke. After Kōzuke's death in battle, his son Kunai-shōyū took charge, and at that time the Ishihama domain was worth 4,000 kan-mon. However, when Chiba came of age, he repeatedly requested the return of Ishihama.>>

<<Despite repeated petitions, Kiuchi's chief retainer Utsuki Kura-no-suke argued that his masters Kōzuke and Kunai-shōyū both had numerous distinguished services and achievements, so the confiscation of Ishihama would be unreasonable, thus causing delays. Meanwhile, someone called Sudō from among Chiba Jirō's retainers, feeling bitter about his lord's unfulfilled desires, targeted Utsuki and committed seppuku at Sōsen-ji, a subsidiary temple in Ishihama. When this was reported to Odawara, they concluded it must have been Chiba Jirō's doing, and ultimately never returned the Ishihama domain.>>

<<Upon consideration, the Kamakura Ōsōshi calls the Makuhari Mutsu-no-kami "Shōki," while the Kantō Kosen-roku calls him "Yasutane." Examining the Chiba genealogy, Yasutane took the tonsure and was called Shōki. He was the second son of Daisuke Mitsu-tane. Also, the annotation in Baikamujinzō gives "Koretane" but mistakenly writes the character for "tane." The Nanpō Kiden should be taken as evidence. Koretane was Sanetane's grandson and Moritane's son. From Sanetane to Koretane, they continuously resided in this castle, and by the Bunmei era, warfare resumed. In a Hōjō family document from Eiroku 2, the following are listed as Lord Chiba's domains: Edo, Akasaka six villages, similarly Niikura, Kotsukue's Kami-maruko, Kasai's Kami-hirai, Shimo-adachi's Fuchie, Ikōji, Nobūchi, Nogō, Ōtakubo, Numata, Hokiso, Mitsumata, and Ōkubo. Upon further consideration, this Ishihama castle was likely abandoned after the Chiba lineage ended in the Tenshō era.>>

Hashiba: From the vicinity of today's Shinmei Shrine southward to the boundary of Imado is called Hashiba. Its old name was Ishihama. <<According to the Shiseki Katsukō, the land of Ishihama is now called Shioiri.>> The Gikeiki records that on the 11th day of the 9th month of Jishō 4 (1180), year of kanoe-ne <<The Azuma Kagami states that on the 2nd day of the 10th month of the same year, Yoritomo crossed the Futoi and Sumida rivers. Futoi refers to the Tone River, which also appears in the Sarashina Diary>>, when Lord Yoritomo crossed the Sumida River traveling from Shimōsa to Musashi Province, two or three days of rain caused floods that submerged the banks, making it difficult to ferry the army across. The military commander ordered Edo Tarō Shigenaga to construct a floating bridge. Shigenaga refused to comply. Therefore, Chiba-no-suke <<Tsunetane>> and Kasai Hyōe <<Kiyoshige>> decided to help Edo Tarō. From their domains of Imai, Kurikawa, Kamenashi, and Ushimato <<the details of Kurikawa, Kamenashi, and Ushimato are unclear>>, they mobilized numerous fishermen's boats, and gathered several thousand ships from the western provinces that happened to be anchored at Ishihama, which was Edo Tarō's domain, constructing a floating bridge within three days.

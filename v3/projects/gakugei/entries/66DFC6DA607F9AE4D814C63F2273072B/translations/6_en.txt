This is the original tutelary shrine, with August 19th as its festival day. The bettō (temple administrator) belongs to the Tendai sect and is called Onozan Reishōin.
　　《Someone says that this shrine was formerly located beside the Seidō (Confucian hall) at Shinobugaoka and was called Ono Myōjin. Since Ono no Takamura deeply revered Confucianism and established a school in Ashikaga, Yashū Province, later at that place too, they enshrined Takamura's statue beside the Seidō and conducted religious services. Here too, following that example, it was placed beside the Shinobugaoka Seidō, but after the Seidō moved to Yushima, it came to be enshrined at the present location. It is also said that a white fox, who was the messenger of the local Inari deity, had its tail tip shine brightly every night, reflecting on the pine trees of the elevated ridge, so from the meaning of "the tail tip shining," various elements mixed together to create the name Ono Terusaki》

Bukkyōzan Anrakuji Temple　Located in Kanasugi, founded during the Shōhō era by the priest Shōrensha Iteki.《It is said that this temple is the former site where Prince Sonchō Hōshin of Chion-in resided in retirement》The main deity is Amida Nyorai with a jeweled crown. It is a branch temple of Isshin-in in Rakuyō (Kyoto) and serves as a sacred domain of the Shasei school. It conducts continuous nembutsu meditation day and night, which is truly admirable.

Hōkyōzan Enkōji Temple　Located in the village of Negishi, this is a Zen temple of the Sai school with Shaka Nyorai as its main deity. In the temple garden there are purple wisteria that create a magnificent sight when in bloom. Therefore, common people call it the Wisteria Temple (Fuji-dera). There is also a famous tree called the Mirror Pine in front of the hall. The tutelary Benzaiten is said to be the work of Kōbō Daishi.

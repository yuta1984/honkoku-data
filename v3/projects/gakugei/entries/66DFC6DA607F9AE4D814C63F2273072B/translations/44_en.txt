Similarly, the bettō (head priest) belongs to the Tendai sect and is called Shōrin-in. The festival is held annually on August 15th, when a hōjōe (ritual release of living beings) is performed.

According to the shrine records, when Minamoto no Yoriyoshi Ason, together with Yoshiie-kō, received imperial orders to subjugate Abe no Sadatō and Munetō in Ōshū, in the 6th year of Kōhei, 8th month of the year of mizunoe-u (1063), they came from Yuhi-gō in Kamakura to this land of Imado for their prayers and invited the spirit of Iwashimizu Hachiman Shrine. 《The Imado shrine records write it as Imatsu, and the Odawara Hōjō family's estate register includes the place names Ishihama Imatsu among the holdings of Kiuchi Kunaishōsuke》 《Upon consideration, since Tsudo and Imado are homophones, it probably came to be called Imado over time》 Later, when the brothers Takehira and Munehira of Ōshū rebelled, Yoshiie Ason also made prayers at Kamakura Tsurugaoka and this shrine's Hachiman-gū, destroyed the rebels and achieved victory. Therefore, in the 1st year of Eihō, year of kanoto-tori (1081), repairs were added to both shrines, and Gyōki's carved Amida was made the honji-butsu (Buddhist deity) of this place, while also enshrining statues of Yakushi of the same maker and Kannon by Jikaku. Later, in the 5th year of Bunji (1189), when Right General Yoritomo-kō set out to pursue Yasuhira of Ōshū, he also made vows to this deity and achieved victory. In the 1st year of Kenkyū, year of kanoe-inu (1190), the shrine was rebuilt with Shimokōbe-no-shōji Yukihira as the magistrate. However, in the 13th year of Kan'ei, year of hinoe-ne (1636), receiving imperial commands, Funakoshi Iyo-no-kami, Yagi Tajima-no-kami and others took charge of the restoration of this shrine, and since then, the divine light becomes new daily and the spiritual power flourishes monthly.

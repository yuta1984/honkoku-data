This stone is extremely white in color with no black patterns. It was quarried in ancient times but is now rare. However, if one does not mind the expense and enters high mountains and deep valleys, it is not impossible to obtain, though there are many places where transportation and manpower are inconvenient.

○Stone Quality: The grain resembles Shirakawa stone from Kyoto and is extremely hard, so when crafting objects, even minute edges and points respond to skilled technique. Shirakawa stone is brittle and unsuitable for fine work. When stonemasons create large objects, starting with torii gates at Tennoji in Naniwa, castle fortifications, stone sarcophagi, Buddhist statues, tombstones, and retaining walls, when polished they become like skin. This is an imperishable material and a supreme treasure of the realm.

○Product Types: Notsura (direct blocks) include large, medium, and small bowls. (The term "bowl" comes from use in water basins, though uses extend to column foundations, drainage stones, and many others)
Zunashi (headless stones) are generally about 1.5-1.6 shaku in size, with larger ones called "single stones." "Six-man" refers to carrying six pieces per load. Kuri-ishi are small stones that roll down mountain valleys during heavy rains, so they have no sharp edges. These are used for basin-front paving stones. (Calling stones "kuri" appears in songs from the Ojin Records and in the Manyoshu collection where "okitsu" is also read as "kuri," said to be dialect from the San'in region, used regardless of size)

Split stones include large-split, medium-split, small-split, elongated strips (long-cut stones), and cover stones (generally about 2 shaku long, 1.1-1.2 shaku wide, 3-4 sun thick), all used for retaining walls, bridge abutments, stone bridges, garden paving, earthworks, and many other purposes. Stones for bridge construction are also sourced separately from Kawachi Province.

○For quarrying, arrow holes are drilled and wedges inserted, then throwing stones create cracks which are separated using levers—this is called "strike-splitting." Splitting horizontally in a straight line is called "scoop-splitting."

○Tatsuyama Stone
Produced in Harima Province, being one mountain of solid stone, it has few trees. Though there are many such stone mountains, only those with convenient transportation are quarried. Now they dig and extract, but mountains with inconvenient transport remain untouched. The Stone Treasure Hall is made of Tatsuyama stone, with that area serving as the main quarrying site. The extraction methods remain unchanged, so illustrations are omitted. The color mixes five hues. All cutting and shaping produces only rectangular forms. Used for drainage channels, riverbanks, boundary wall paving, threshold earthworks, garden paving, and similar purposes—not manufactured into other objects. Sizes range from 3-4 shaku to 7-8 shaku, with 5-sun by 6-sun pieces called "five-six" and 5-sun by 7-sun called "five-seven," with even larger varieties available. (There are stonemasons in Shioichi village at the foot, and at Ozaki to the south is a place called "Dragon's Edge" with stones resembling dragon heads, hence the name Tatsuyama [Dragon Mountain])

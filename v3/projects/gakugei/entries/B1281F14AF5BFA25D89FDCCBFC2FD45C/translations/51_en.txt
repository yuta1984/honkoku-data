They continue by showing dim lamplight and gradually bringing it closer over successive nights. This is because if they startle the bird with bright light at first, it becomes a permanent habit, making it difficult later to dry wet feathers by a fire. There are many other harmful effects as well. After accumulating night-perching sessions and seeing that the hawk has become accustomed, showing hand gestures and body shaking in a relaxed manner, they perform morning perching. This involves gradually extending morning sessions starting from before dawn, and later taking them out to fields even in broad daylight. At this time the meat quality improves, and unable to assess the bird's hunting instincts when seeing wild birds, they show stored small birds and have the hawk catch them nearby. However, they cut or tie the small bird's beak. This is to prevent it from pecking the hawk or making noise. If it makes noise and startles the hawk, they dislike it becoming a permanent habit. This is called "rounding the waist" or "rounding the beak." When the bird catches well, they feed it a little warm blood (meaning meat), but not much. Too much feeding makes the meat fat and poor quality. They pay attention to growth, considering whether it's gaining or losing weight, the quality of its wing condition and facial features. For large hawks, small pupils indicate good meat quality; for small hawks it's the opposite. They also consider the color of droppings to maintain good balance (this is called "preparing the meat"), and provide live birds for flight training (flight training involves sewing the bird's eyes shut, taking it to fields to fly high, and having the hawk engage with it. Sewing the eyes is to make it fly high in a straight line). If they can catch this skillfully, they then take them to mountains and fields for hunting.

○Nest hawks are taken from nests and kept in cages lined with mugwort leaves and rabbit fur, fed finely cut small birds with no water mixed in. ○The initial plumage is called sticky down or cotton down, and there are growth stages including patchy down and scattered down. The growth of tail feathers marks the maturation period, observed as first molt and second molt. At the third molt, a perch is placed in the cage.
From the beginning, mosquito netting is hung over the cage to prevent mosquito bites. Males are called elder hawks and females are called younger hawks, distinguished by weight. Light ones are called elder, heavy ones younger. After tail feathers have grown long and formed properly, leg cords are attached and the bird is tied to a perch for about five days, perched quietly, then bathed in lukewarm water for about three days. If it won't bathe, water is sprinkled repeatedly. The contracted feathers are stretched, and following the previous method with live birds rounded up, afterwards it becomes normal.

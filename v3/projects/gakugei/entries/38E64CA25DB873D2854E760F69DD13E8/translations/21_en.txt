Namamugi Village
Shikaraki Tea Shop

Namamugi is an intermediate post station between Kawasaki and Kanagawa, serving as a resting place. The water tea house called "Shikaraki" in this area has been selling pickled plums and trading pickled ginger since opening its shop during the Kyōhō era. There is no traveler who does not rest here, and its current prosperity is extraordinary.

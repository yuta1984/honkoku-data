According to tradition, the "Zoku Urashima-ko Den" (Continuation of the Tale of Urashima) states that Urashima was from Sumie. Upon examination, in the "Man'yōshū-shō" by the monk Senkaku, which quotes from the "Tango Fudoki," it says "Mitsu-no-e-no Urashima-no-ko," already using "Mitsu-no-e." Since "water (mitsu)" has the meaning of "clear (sumu)," they are used interchangeably.

According to tradition, in ancient times during the reign of Emperor Yūryaku (the 22nd year, year of Tsuchinoe-Uma, 7th month, according to the Nihon Shoki's Yūryaku chronicle), there was a person named Mizue-no-Urashima-ko from Kutagawa in Yosa District, Tango Province. According to temple records, a man named Mizue-no-Urashima Dayū from Miura in Sagami Province moved temporarily to a place called Kutagawa in Yosa District, Tanba Province in connection with the Taika Reform. His son was called Urashima Tarō. Ancient books write "Urashima-ko," but only temple records use "Dayū" or "Tarō." The "Zoku Urashima-ko Den" states that it's unknown where Urashima-ko was from, but he was probably an immortal sage from ancient times. Though over 300 years old, his appearance was like that of a child, and as a human he loved immortal arts and studied secret techniques. Also, the "Tango Fudoki" says he was an ancestor of the Kusakabe no Obito and was called Shima-ko of Tsutsu River - this is indeed Mizue-no-Urashima-ko.

One time in the seventh month, while fishing alone in a small boat on the sea, he caught a sacred turtle. Seeing its unusual appearance, he found it strange and, taking pity on it, released it. After a while, the turtle transformed into a beautiful woman who, to repay his earlier kindness, took Urashima-ko by the hand and led him to Hōrai Mountain, the capital of Watatsumi, the sea god.

Thus afterward, Urashima-ko lived in the immortal's chamber, constantly tasting divine medicines, seeing beautiful flowers with his eyes, hearing elegant music with his ears, and spending his days in banquets and entertainment. (The "Nihon Kōki" states that Urashima-ko was at Hōrai for three years; the "Tango Fudoki" says the same, and the "Man'yōshū" also mentions "leaving home for three years without any word.") However, feelings of longing for his homeland arose.

A heart longing arose, and as he missed his parents alone, when he told the divine woman of this matter, though the divine woman yearned for their parting, since there seemed no possibility of him staying, she reluctantly gave him a jeweled box, saying: "If you should not forget me and wish to come again to this divine immortal realm, you must never open and look inside this box." Urashima-ko made this promise and, greatly rejoicing, received the box, parted hands, and took his leave. Soon after leaving the immortal capital of Hōrai, he found himself back in his old village of Yosa. (The "Nihon Kōki" says Urashima-ko returned to his village in the 2nd year of Tenchō, making it 347 years. The "Shirinsa-iyō-shō" says that after Shima-ko entered Hōrai, 32 imperial reigns passed. The "Mizukagami" states that in the 23rd year of Emperor Yūryaku's reign, in the 7th month, Urashima-ko went to Hōrai, and the same book says he returned in the 2nd year of Tenchō under Emperor Junna. Having disappeared during Emperor Yūryaku's reign and returning after 347 years. Considering this, the 2nd year of Tenchō corresponds to Kinoto-Mi in the sexagenary cycle, while the 23rd year of Emperor Yūryaku corresponds to Tsuchinoto-Hitsuji. The Nihon Shoki gives the 22nd year as Tsuchinoe-Uma. This would make it 348 years.)

However, things had changed and the stars had moved; homes and gardens had become riverbeds, and mountains had transformed into seas and rivers. The desolate villages had lost their smoke, old embankments stood lonely, and there were no traces of roads. Moreover, there wasn't even anyone he knew in the area, so both puzzled and startled, he asked the villagers about the whereabouts of the old customs. One old man answered, saying: "I once heard that long ago...

[Note: "Kasegawa" is likely an error for "Tsutsukawa." Later passages state that "Kutagawa is written as Tsutsukawa in the Tango Fudoki."]

(Continuation of the bell inscription)
Speaking of this, there are distinctions between yin and yang, day and night, and regarding people, there are differences between the deluded and the enlightened, the sage and the ordinary. Indeed, our Buddha compassionately expounds teachings throughout the six directions (heaven, earth, and four cardinal points), making no distinction between the heavenly realm and the human world, taking the benefit of all sentient beings as his work. However, he guides and benefits sentient beings according to their various spiritual capacities, enabling all to perfect their enlightened nature equally. Thus he established the sound of bells and Buddha's name to rescue those who have fallen into delusion. How inexpressible are these merits!

Here there is one called Beppō, the head priest of Garyūzan Unshō-in Temple in Negoya village, Kozukue manor, Tsuzuki district, Musashi Province. He is a descendant of the Sōtō sect and a branch of the Daigen school, belonging to the lineage of Sekiun-in Temple at Takao in Enshū Province. In the late spring of this year of Mizunoe-inu, he gathered donations from the assembly and cast this bronze bell to completion, simultaneously building a new bell tower and hanging the bell from its beam. Therefore, he requested an inscription from me to record this.

The inscription says:
The entire world is in darkness, but only the bell is bright. Its sound transmits throughout the dharma realm, its resonance penetrates the netherworld.
Where the bell is heard in darkness, all dark places become bright. When brightness reaches dark places, dark places lose their form.
Hearing and returning to hearing, practice is quickly accomplished. Not hearing yet hearing, bodhi arises naturally.
Grace pervades the six realms, benefit reaches its ultimate in the four forms of birth. Countless sentient beings all ascend together to the transformed city.

Kozukue Castle Ruins - Located about five chō (approximately 550 meters) away from the same road, climbing about two chō up what is called Shirozaka (Castle Slope) to the right of the road. Local people call it Shiroyama (Castle Mountain). It is now government forest. The Odawara-ki records: "On the 13th day of the first month of Tenna 4, year of Kinoe-saru, Hōjō Ujitsuna defeated Uesugi Tomooki in battle, and after returning from campaign, undertook construction of Kozukue Castle." Therefore, he made the senior retainers Kasahara Echizen-no-kami and similarly Noto-no-kami, father and son, serve as castle commanders and reside at this location.

The boundaries now encompass a small hill of about one chō north to south and about four chō east to west, with traces of moats remaining around the perimeter. ⟪Side note: Height of six to seven jō and more⟫ The flat ground at the center is only about one hundred paces and is now used as farmland. ⟪Side note: In ancient times, it is said there were 108 villages belonging to Kozukue spanning Tachibana and Tsuzuki districts⟫ Also, descendants of a person called Numakami Dewa, a retainer of the Kasahara family, still exist in this area. It is said that family keeps swords and similar weapons. ⟪Side note: Upon examination, the Hōjō family's register of retainer holdings notes that a person named Numakami held land at Ida within Kozukue, which likely refers to this Dewa. Also, the same document states that a person called Kasahara Tōzaemon held Kozukue Hassaku, and one called Kasahara Sado held Kozukue Tsunashima and Minowa within Saemon-no-suke's holdings. Kasahara Yajūrō, under Takada Genbannosuke, held areas within Kozukue Sugao, and within the holdings of one called Kasahara Heizaemon, the place name Kozukue Morooka is also noted. Upon consideration, all were likely members of Echizen-no-kami's clan⟫

Hakusan Gongen - Located on the eastern ridge of Shiroyama. It is said to have been the ancient tutelary shrine.

　The Tsurumi River, twenty-seven ken in length, has its source in the areas of Onoji in Tama District, Nagatsuta in Tsuzuki District, and Makinu in Tachibana District. The rivers Onda, Hayase, Yagami, Toriyama, and Saedo converge and flow to Tsurumi Village, hence the name Tsurumi River. According to the Baishoron, on the 14th day of the 5th month of Genkō 3, Musashi-no-kami Sadamasa led forces as a general for the Kamakura side. From Shimōsa, Chiba-no-suke Sadatane, acting in concert with Yoshisada, attacked from below. They fought in the area of Tsurumi in Musashi Province, were defeated, and retreated.

It is called Myōō-san Fudō-in Shinpuku-ji Temple, belongs to the Tendai sect, and is affiliated with Jōgyō-ji Temple in Shinagawa. The main deity, Fudō Myōō, is enshrined there. The statue is a seated figure over six shaku tall, said to be the work of Jikaku Daishi. The main hall houses an Eleven-faced Kannon, a seated statue about two shaku tall, created by Gyōki Bosatsu. The plaque on the Niō Gate inscribed with "Shinpuku-ji" was written by Chidō, the Grand Priest of Zōjō-ji Temple.

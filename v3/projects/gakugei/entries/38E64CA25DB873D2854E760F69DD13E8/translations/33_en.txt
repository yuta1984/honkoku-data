It is noted: "On the 24th day of the 8th month of Einin 2 (1294), year of Kinoe-Uma, at the Nyohō Dōjō of Hōren-ji Temple in Fukuda Village, Tsutsukawa-shō, Tanshū, unable to go against the fragrant command, I look back on my writing and hastily wield my purple brush in disorder."

According to the temple records, later he maintained a lifespan of 8,000 years and again entered the capital of the sea god (summarizing the main points of various books). Originally, this temple was built by imperial decree of Emperor Junna, and is an ancient temple that has passed through approximately 970 years. The fourth consort of the same emperor was a ninth-generation descendant of Urashima-ko. The consort deeply devoted herself to Buddhism, reported to the emperor, consulted with Abbot Kūkai, had Hinoo Sōzu Jitsue oversee it, constructed Buddhist halls, and made it a Shingon esoteric training ground.

According to the "Genkō Shakusho," Nyoi Hōni was a person from Yosa District in Tango Province who entered the capital at age ten. In Kōnin 13, after the emperor had a divine dream, he sent flower messengers and obtained her as consort. The consort deeply devoted herself to Buddhism and constantly revered the Nyoirin Buddha. She once kept a box, and no one could see inside it. It is said that in Tenchō 1, there was a great drought throughout the land. Shubin and Kūkai competed to pray for rain rituals. Kūkai offered the consort's box and performed secret rites, so rain fell throughout the land. In the consort's hometown there was a person called Mizue-no-Urashima-ko who, several hundred years before the consort, had long dwelt in the immortal realm. In Tenchō 2 he returned to his hometown. Urashima-ko said the box the consort possessed was called the Purple Cloud Box. When Master Kūkai carved Buddhist statues, he placed the consort's image inside the box. The commentary in the same book says the consort's box was probably not a vessel of divine immortals, but rather was a secret of esoteric Buddhism. Urashima-ko was merely a guest of Hōrai - how could he know this?

Afterward, as years passed, the palace was broken by wind and became a pitiful sight, soaked by rain, and the morning mist and evening moon changed to incense smoke and lamp light. Therefore, they could only await the time of spiritual connection and response. However, around the Ōchō and Shōwa eras,

the second abbot of Kamakura Kōmyō-ji Temple, Jakue Shōnin (a younger brother of the record's author and great founder of the Shirahata school - his biography is omitted here), whenever he traveled to his hometown Shirahata, would visit the Kannon of this temple and lament that there was no one to tend it. He made his dharma brother Ekō Shōnin (family name Ōmori, a person from Sagami Province) the head priest, built the temple buildings twice, and newly made it a hall for pure practice.

Kanagawa Station - One of the fifty-three stations of the Tōkaidō. The distance from Kawasaki is two and a half ri.
(Books such as "Taiheiki," "Baika Mushimzō," and "Kamakura Ōsōshi" all write it as Kanagawa, while "Entai-reki" writes it as Kanogawa. The meaning of this place name is detailed in the following section on Kaminashi River.)

There are names like Honjuku (the general name for the four-chō area from Shinmachi to the western town) and Aoki-chō (the general name for the six-chō area from Taki-no-machi to Shimodai). Also, from Dai to the opposite area called Karuizawa, everything is called Kanagawa Station.

From "Heian Kikō":
"Like a fisherman's small boat approaching the eaves, I gaze at the incomparable village of Kano River" - Mochisuke

From "Baika Mushimzō," Bunmei 17 (1485):
"Kanagawa (2nd day of late autumn) - Emerging into the world, on the way from Toi to Edo, there is an old pine twisted and bent, its form like a dragon, and that place is called Ryū-mori."
"Kanagawa people's shops and board houses in a row / Deep mud buries horses, making progress difficult
Ryū-mori's spring stirs the reclining old pine / Not yet entered is the flying dragon of the nine-five heaven"

Grave of Yoshitaka Nyūdō (There is a small hall beside the Niō gate, in front of an ancient tomb, where a stone Jizō statue is enshrined. A plaque inscribed "Yoshitaka Nyūdō" hangs from the eaves. According to tradition, Yoshitaka Nyūdō was called Ogasawara Kurandō and later took the name Satomi. He is said to have died in battle at Odawara, though this has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Among the farming families in this area is a certain member of the Hirata clan, whose ancestor is said to have been a retainer of Yoshitaka Nyūdō. Additionally, among the temple treasures of Shōon-ji is a diagram from the first year of Kenmu [1334], and among the names annotated there is "Land Steward and Guardian of Awa Province, Ogasawara Kurandō Tarō Nyūdō." The reference to Awa Province here is probably an error for Awa Province [present-day Chiba]. This Ogasawara Kurandō might be an ancestor of the aforementioned Yoshitaka Nyūdō, or perhaps the name Yoshitaka was confused with Satomi through false association. This requires further investigation.)

Gokoku-san Kanfuku-ji Temple: Located in Higashi-Koyasu village, on the mountainside to the right of Shinjuku Kaidō. It is commonly called Urashima Temple. Formerly it was called Kikoku-san Urashima-in according to the temple's founding records. This temple was built by imperial wish of Emperor Junna and founded by Priest Hinoo-sōzu.

Main Hall: The principal image is the Sacred Kannon Bodhisattva (a standing statue one shaku and three sun tall, known solely as Urashima's Kannon. According to temple tradition, when Urashima-ko was enjoying himself at Hōko's Rantai and was about to return to his old village, a divine woman gave him a jeweled box along with a sacred image of Great Compassion, saying: "You are now about to return to your homeland. Therefore I wish for you to overcome the difficulties of sea winds and waves, and to have a long life." Finally, after the island child returned to his hometown, he reached Kasumi-ga-ura in Musashi Province [present-day Kanagawa area], and following the oracle of the sacred image, he learned the location of his father's grave, built a grass hut nearby, and enshrined that sacred image of Great Compassion there.)

Urashima Myōjin (enshrined in the main hall. Also called the Eight-Thousand-Year Shrine according to the founding records. This shrine enshrines the spirit of Urashima Tarō. Five generations after the founding priest Hinoo-sōzu)

(During the time of Saint Shōkai, there was a divine oracle on the 7th day of the 7th month of the 7th year of Kanpei [895], and since then July 7th has been observed as the festival day every year. Now, in what is called Higashi-Amino village by the Asamo River in Takeno District, Tango Province, there is a sacred shrine to Urashima-ko, called Asamokawa Myōjin, also known as Amino Myōjin, as seen in books such as Shirinsa'iyō and Jinja Keimō. The Wakan Sansai Zue states that Urashima-ko was a descendant of Nemi-no-mikoto. This should be investigated.)

Transformed Turtle Great Dragon Woman (also in the main hall. Said to celebrate and enshrine the sacred turtle that Urashima-ko obtained while fishing at sea. As the deity of safe sea crossing protection, many sailors revere it greatly.)

Dragon Lantern Pine (located at the peak of the mountain behind the temple. Tradition says that even now, dragon lanterns sometimes hang from this tree. Since the principal image of this temple is a sacred statue inherited from the Dragon Palace, this serves as proof of that.)

Landmark Lantern (below the Dragon Lantern Pine. Used as a guide for ships entering port at night. Built by a local farmer named Matsui during the Kyōhō era, and continues to this day.)

Bodhi Trees (several trees in the temple's mountain forest that regenerate year after year. Tradition says they were brought by Urashima-ko from the dragon capital.)

Urashima Tarō's Grave (in front of the hall. Said to be called the "age mound" because the island child built it himself.) Also, the Foot-washing Well (beside the road, still used as water supply by local people. Also called Hotei-maru's Well.) Also, the Sitting Stone (its old site is now uncertain.)

The Nihon-ki Yūryaku Record states: In the 22nd year of Emperor Yūryaku, autumn of the 7th month of the year Boshin, Mizunoe Urashima-ko of Kanagawa in Yosa District, Tamba Province, rode a boat fishing, finally caught a large turtle which immediately transformed into a woman. Urashima-ko was moved and took her as his wife, and together they entered the sea, reached Mount Hōrai, and toured to observe the immortals. The story is in a separate volume.

The Nihon Kōki Junna Record states: In the 2nd year of Tenchō during the reign of Emperor Junna, he returned to his village—347 years to the present. Urashima-ko reached Hōrai and resided there for three years. In spring when the weather first warmed, birds sang in harmony, mists and clouds drifted, and flowering trees competed in blooming. He asked about plans to return. The woman said: "The dwelling of the immortals—once one leaves, it is difficult to return again. Even if you return to your hometown, it is surely not a day for permanent residence." Urashima-ko, wishing to visit old relatives and friends, urgently pressed to return home. The woman gave him a box saying: "Be careful not to open it."

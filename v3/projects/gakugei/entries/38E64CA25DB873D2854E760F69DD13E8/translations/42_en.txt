Kumano Gongen-san (Mount Kumano Gongen) - This mountain continues from Kannon Hall, and on slightly elevated ground to the left of the hall stands a modest grass shrine. It is said to be the site of a castle fortification built by Mamiya Shirōzaemon, a retainer who rendered distinguished service to the Hōjō family of Odawara in ancient times. The Kumano Gongen Shrine mentioned in the previous section, located to the right from the Honjuku-machi highway, may have been relocated from this site, with this grass shrine left in its place to preserve the old location. According to the Odawara Chronicles, in the autumn of Eishō 7 (1510), in the seventh month, a retainer of Uesugi Jibu-no-Shōyū Nyūdō Kenpō named Ueda Kurando plotted rebellion, allied himself with Hōjō Sōun, and fortified Kumano Gongen-san in Kanagawa, Musashi Province as a castle, barricading himself there. Therefore, Jibu-no-Shōyū personally took command as general, and with reinforcements granted by the Kanrei - Narita Shimousa-no-Kami, Shibue Magojirou, Fujita Torajumaru, Ōishi Genzaemon, Yano Aki Nyūdō as deputy for Nagao Magotarō, Narita Nakatsukasa-no-Jō as deputy for Nagao Tajima-no-Kami, and other southern Musashi confederates - they advanced on Gongen-san on the 11th of the same month and besieged it until the 19th, finally capturing the castle. This refers to events at this location.

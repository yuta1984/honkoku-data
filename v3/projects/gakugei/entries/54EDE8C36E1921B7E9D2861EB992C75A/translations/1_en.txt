Myōkenzan Yūten-ji Temple: Located about five chō to the west of the same area, it is called Senkyū-in. During the Kyōhō era, the second abbot Yūkai established this temple on the site of the remains of Great Priest Yūten, making Great Priest Yūten the founder. It is a dōjō for continuous nembutsu chanting, and the sound of bells and drums echoes through the mountain forest. 《This recitation of the Buddha's name has continued uninterrupted since it began at the time of the founder Great Priest Yūten's death》Every year from July 16th to the 25th, the thousand-volume Amida Sutra recitation practice is conducted, and both monks and laypeople gather in crowds.

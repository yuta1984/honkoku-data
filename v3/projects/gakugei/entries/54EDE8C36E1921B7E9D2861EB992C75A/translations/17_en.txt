Bell Inscription and Preface for Entsuji Temple in Akasaka
Entsuji Temple in Akasaka, Musashi Province, solicited funds to cast a thousand-kin copper bell in preparation for the twelve zodiacal hours.
According to the Daishu-kyo Sutra, bodhisattvas, responding to their vows of compassion, transform into the twelve zodiacal animals and, dwelling in the treasure mountain,
practice the karmic connections of compassion, becoming masters of all spirits and controlling their disturbances to protect the world.
The intention of Entsuji Temple's undertaking lies here. The head priest asked me through an intermediary to compose an inscription, so
I composed twelve rhymes distinguishing the twelve animals and presented them. Someone said, "Even so, isn't this like mere play?" I replied, "Buddhas and bodhisattvas show various bodies for the sake of all beings, appear in various lands, and establish various teachings. From blowing conches, beating drums, to ringing bells, all are nothing but play. Hence it is said, 'Playing in all worlds like a magician, like child's play.' I too am secretly a student. Composing this inscription and making Buddhist practice from playful calligraphy is also appropriately done through play."

The inscription says:
　Light flows on Rat Mountain, people not yet startled　　The Ox King appears in the world, shaking Brahma's voice
　Tiger, wolf, wild fox, energy running wild　　Rabbit horns skillfully entice the feelings of the multitude
　In the dragon palace's high place, striking the flower whale　　Snake chamber's sleep broken, awakening mind arises
　Horse belly suddenly transforms, sacred embryo formed　　Sheep, deer, ox cart rest and no longer struggle
　Monkey cries, frost falls, moon color clear　　Rooster man not yet singing, guest already departs
　Dog doesn't bark at night in Rajagriha city　　Boar touches golden mountain, turning ever more precipitous

Konronzan Gyokuso-ji Temple: Located in the same area on the right side, between the Aoyama family estate. It belongs to the Zen sect.
The founding priest was Zen Master Fuko, and the founder was Gyokuso Chin Daishi, daughter of Aoyama Tadatoshi. Hence the temple name. The statue of Kannon is said to have been made from incense by Chunagon-hime. [Marginal note: Aoyama is west of Akasaka and north of Shibuya. This area originally belonged to Azabu village. After Tensho, this land was granted to Aoyama Inaba-no-kami Tadatoshi. At that time, the highway to Shibuya was also within the compound]

[Marginal note: and was particularly spacious, so a road was opened in the middle, and the brothers lived separated by the road. Tadatoshi's temple is north of the road and is called Gyokuso-ji. This is indeed our temple. What is south of the road]
[Marginal note: is Yukinari's temple, which is Baiso-in. Someone says this land was Yamaguchi Shigemasa's estate around Tensho period, but later the land was divided and given to his son-in-law Takagi Monto-no-kami Masatsugu. For certain reasons, this land was later granted to the Aoyama]
[Marginal note: family. Because the land was so extensive, it came to be called Aoyama.]

Hyakurazan Hokaku-mitsuji Shingon-kyoin Temple: This temple is a branch temple of Daigo,
called Kaijo-e-in, and serves as the head temple for esoteric verification temples throughout the provinces. The main temple is located on Mount Tosumi in Yoshino District, Yamato Province.
The fundamental founder was Daishi Rigen, whose posthumous name was Shoho Sojo. He was the son
of Prince Katsuno, son of Emperor Konin. He took ordination under Shinga Sojo, the younger brother of Kobo Daishi,
accumulated years of diligent study, visited the renowned masters of Nanto, and studied
Hosso, Sanron, Kegon, and Yuishiki doctrines. His wisdom advanced daily, so the sacred sovereign of ten thousand chariots and the court nobles of the time
revered the virtue of this venerable master deeply. At the time of Emperor Uda's first year of Kanpyo, year of the Metal Rooster,
when the venerable master was fifty-eight years old, a poisonous dragon dwelt in Mount Kinbu in Yamato Province, causing continuous rain and floods so that the five grains
did not ripen, and the mountain ascetics were also forced to abandon their practices. Thereupon the emperor
was troubled in his imperial heart and issued an edict to the master to subdue the poisonous dragon. The master received the imperial command and

This is a pure temple established by the priest as a sacred place of the Nine Grades and Nine Assemblies.

Main Hall: The principal image is Amida Nyorai (a six-foot wooden statue). The plaque reads "Ryūgo-den," written by Priest Kakei of this temple.

Inner Buddha principal image Amida Nyorai statue: It is said that Prince Shōtoku carved this at age 42 to remove disasters from all sentient beings. When Priest Kaseki was 18 years old and practicing nembutsu meditation in a hermitage near Reigan-ji Temple in Fukagawa, at dawn one day a high-ranking monk came carrying this principal image on his back, explained its origins, and entrusted it to Priest Kaseki. From then on, the priest's wisdom and virtue flourished greatly, and many people of high and low status, both religious and lay, received benefits. Therefore, there was no shortage of materials for carving the Nine Grade Buddhas, and with the help of this sacred image, all 36,000 Buddhist deities were successfully completed.

Jizō Statue: Enshrined in a small hall facing the main hall. It is called the honji-butsu (original ground Buddha) of the founding priest Kaseki. Created by Priest Eshin Sōzu. This principal image once stood on Mount Mino in Tanba Province. A wicked and immoral hunter named Ōe no Shigetoki who lived at its base once went to the mountain and encountered sudden rain. When he rested in the Jizō hall, he pitied the fact that the hall was ruined and the Buddha statue was soaked by rain and dew, so he covered the principal image with his own hat. Due to this karmic connection, when he died and went to the underworld, this sacred image took on Shigetoki's suffering and allowed him to return to this world again. Later, for certain reasons, it was moved to Mount Kōya, but Priest Ryōzan Hōin, admiring the spiritual light of the founding priest of this temple, entrusted it here.

Statue of Founding Priest Kaseki: Enshrined in the guest hall. Because the priest received divine revelations from Nyorai several times during his lifetime, this was carved. There is a writing in the founding priest's own hand placed alongside this portrait, which states:

"This statue was carved according to three divine messages from Nyorai. If future generations form karmic connections with this statue, it will remove various disasters in this life and surely guide them to the Pure Land in the future. Manji 1st year, 7th month, 24th day. Kaseki, age 42 (seal)"

For this reason, people call it the efficacious image for warding off misfortune.

Mandala Hall: Located to the left of the main hall. The central Buddha is a three-Buddha Amida statue created by Kōbō Daishi. Originally in a nembutsu hall in Ōshima Village, Fukagawa, it was moved to this temple by a monk named Jōshō who was the hall keeper.

The remainder includes the Five Wisdom Buddhas, the Eternal Eon Buddha, and the Five Eon Contemplation Buddha. This sacred statue has a full face different from other statues.

Middle Grade Hall: Lined up to the right. Enshrines statues of Amida Nyorai of the three grades: Middle Grade Middle Birth, Middle Grade Superior Birth, and Middle Grade Inferior Birth.

Superior Grade Hall: Facing the main hall. Enshrines the three grades of Amida Nyorai: Superior Grade Middle Birth, Superior Grade Superior Birth, and Superior Grade Inferior Birth.

Inferior Grade Hall: Lined up to the left. Enshrines the three grades of Amida Nyorai: Inferior Grade Middle Birth, Inferior Grade Superior Birth, and Inferior Grade Inferior Birth.

The above nine Amida Nyorai statues are enshrined. Each is a seated statue measuring one jō six shaku (about 16 feet), with each Buddha statue having a halo and 1,011 small Buddha figures attached - all nine statues are alike. All were carved by founding Priest Kaseki, who daily saved three sen for Buddha-making expenses. From Kanbun 4 to Kanbun 7, in just four years, he was able to complete all nine Amida statues of the Nine Grades. Initially these principal images were at Reigan-ji, but after being damaged by floods, they were all moved to this location in Enpō 6. Some say that Priest Kaseki passed away before completing all the halls, and his cousin Priest Kaoku came from Anpuku-ji Temple on Mount Gyokushu in Kawachi Province to complete the construction. The plaques of all Nine Grade Halls were written by Priest Kaoku.

Founder's Hall: Located behind the Superior Grade Hall, on an embankment at the site of an old castle. It contains an image of founding Priest Kaseki at age 72. The Okusawa Nine Grade Buddha Chronicle states he sat in a chair with a staff beside him, but it is actually a standing statue in a prayer posture. This should be further verified.

Founding Priest Kaseki's Mausoleum: Located to the right of the Founder's Hall, called the Inner Temple. Recently a stone fence was constructed.

Star Well: Located on a small hill in front of the founder's mausoleum. It is said that when faithful people single-mindedly chant the name of Buddha, even in broad daylight, the light of many stars appears at the bottom of the water.

Bell Tower: Located to the right of the main hall. Contains a whale bell made in Kan'ei 5, cast with images of the nine Amida Nyorai of the Nine Grades.

Gate Tower: Located in the same area. The upper floor enshrines statues of twenty-five bodhisattvas, while the lower floor houses wooden statues of the two Deva Kings, Kongō and Misshaku.

He entered Mount Kinbu, wielding the power of the Dharma to subdue the dragon and revive the path of mountain asceticism.
Subsequently, through imperial petition, he established a temple in Yoshino District. This is Hokaku-ji Temple. He made
Teiso Sojo, the master's leading disciple, the first abbot, and in the third year of Shotai, for the first time here
he performed the esoteric ritual of peak-entry initiation. Since then, over seven hundred years passed, and during the Genroku
era, the restorer Shunson Sozu moved the temple name to Edo, making it a head temple
of the sect, also governing Enshu Hakusan Nitai-bo Kosho-in, a place connected to the divine ancestor [Tokugawa Ieyasu], as
a prayer temple for peace under heaven and benefit to the nation and people. Every year on April 8th and July 19th,
there are Shinto rituals of forward and reverse peaks and saitō-goma ceremonies. On these days, many people come to worship.
The temple's principal image, Fudo Myo-o, is a miraculous sacred statue that local people call
Shusse Fudo-son (Success Fudo), with constant pilgrims. In the side altar are enshrined images
of Shinhen Bosatsu and Daishi Rigen. Within the temple grounds is a small shrine to Mitsumine Gongen Inari. There are cherry trees in the precincts, with
beautiful viewing in late spring. This tree was grown from seeds that the temple's first generation, Shunken Sozu, had brought from Mount Katsuragi
and planted in the former grounds at Shoheizaka, naming it Takama-zakura, a famous tree.

When the Minamoto Yoriyoshi brothers pursued campaigns in Oshu, they carried this sacred image as protection for their military camp.

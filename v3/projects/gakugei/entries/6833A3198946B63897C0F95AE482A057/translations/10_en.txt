It is located on the left side and belongs to the Jōdo sect temple Shōganji in Kōnosu. This temple was originally a grass hermitage called Fukōan in ancient times, but in the 15th year of Keichō (1610), year of the metal dog, the founding abbot Sōrensha En'yo Fuzan created the temple with a statue of Amida Nyorai as the principal image. (It is 3 shaku and 2 sun tall) It is a work by the Buddhist sculptor Unkei. In ancient times, it was created by order of Hōjō Masako, the Nun of the Second Rank from Kamakura. Much later, in the 18th year of Tenshō (1590), Lady Sūgen'in moved it from Kamakura and held it in devotion, but later bestowed it upon Master Taichō, and the temple's second-generation abbot Shōrensha Gyōyo Chūzan enshrined it in this temple. (The 17th-generation Master Seiyo's spiritual light spread widely in all directions, and there were many devotees) The statue of Enma-ō in the temple grounds is a sculpture by Unkei. It is a seated statue eight shaku tall. (Every year on the 16th of January and July, worshippers gather in crowds) In October, the temple is most lively with the Ten Nights Service. The three large characters "Kaigan-san" on the mountain gate plaque are the authentic calligraphy of former Grand Priest Enzan Unkwa.

Shiohama: The same area extends across eighteen seaside villages. It has scenic beauty and quiet charm. The local people say that the origin of this salt beach is very ancient, and they do not know its beginning. However, after the entry into Kantō in the 18th year of Tenshō (1590), when hunting in Tōgane in southern Sōshū, the shogun observed this salt beach, summoned a humble salt-maker to Funabashi Palace, listened carefully to matters of production, and in his great pleasure bestowed some gold, ordering that the smoke from the salt kilns should continue forever as a treasure of the realm. From then until around the Kan'ei era, when the Great Tree (shogun) went hunting in Tōgane, he would bestow gold and the like, and even when there were disasters from wind and waves, he would order repairs. (According to "Shiseki Gōkō," salt-making in this area goes back over a thousand years. The same book also states that soon after the entry into Kantō in Tenshō 18, a waterway to the salt beaches of Gyōtoku was opened. This is the present Onagi River.)

The salt pans of this area are superior in manufacture to others, being strong and long-lasting in preservation, so all of the eight eastern provinces use them for food preparation.

Kabuto-no-miya: Located on the raised path at the entrance to Gyōtoku. Its origin is now unknown. Some local people传 say that a helmet from someone at the Battle of Kōnodai is enshrined there. This may well be so.

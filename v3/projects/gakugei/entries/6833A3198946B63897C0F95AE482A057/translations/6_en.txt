All the temple monks were scattered and the temple was eventually abandoned, so now only its name is preserved.

Matsudo-tsu: A post station on the Hitachi Highway with station facilities. The passage in Sarashina Nikki that mentions "staying at Kagami-no-se Matsusato-no-tsu" may refer to this place. {According to the Gikeiki, on September 11th of Jishō 4 (1180), [Minamoto no Yoshitsune] arrived at a place called Ichikawa in Matsudo-no-shō at the border between Musashi and Shimōsa provinces. Perhaps it was formerly known as Matsudo-no-shō.}

Matsudo Embankment: Same location. Refers to the embankment of the New Tone River. The Kōnodai Senki records that in October of Tenbun 6 (1537), when Hōjō Ujitsuna was attacking Oyumi Gosho Yoshiakira, on the night of the 4th of that month, Ujitsuna secretly crossed the Asakusa River in the middle of the night, passed through Ōtsu-no-shuku late at night, and held a war council at the Matsudo embankment. {The location of Ōtsu-no-shuku is unknown today. I believe there is Aoto Village in Kasai, and the locals pronounce Aoto as "afuto." Also, since "tsu" and "to" are phonetically similar, it might refer to Aoto. The shrine records of Imado Hachimangū state that Imado was formerly called Imatsu, which is a similar example.}

Sagami-dai: Refers to the plateau east of Matsudo station. Its area is approximately 500 paces from north to south and over 400 paces from east to west. The Kōnodai Senki records that during the Battle of Kōnodai in October of Tenbun 6, after crossing the Matsudo River, about fifty horsemen from the Gosho camp, including those from Shiitsu, Murakami, Horie, and Kashima, climbed up to Sagami-dai to observe the enemy numbers.

Tomb of the Oyumi Prince: According to the section on Yoshiakira's destruction in the Kōnodai Senki, a wet nurse named Rensei came secretly to this Sagami-dai to see the prince's corpse and visited his grave, but today the location of that tomb is uncertain.

Gyōtoku Boat Landing: The wharf at Gyōtoku 4-chōme, which locals call Shin-gashi (New Wharf). There are inns and it is bustling. The boat route from the wharf at Koami-chō 3-chōme in Edo to this place is 3 ri and 8 chō. This place serves as the highway to various provinces including Bōsō and Hitachi.

Benzaiten Shrine: Located in Minato Village, 4-5 chō downstream from the same location. It was formerly situated under a pine grove on the tide-prevention embankment. {The former site is called Benten-yama and has a small stone shrine.} It has now been moved to Enmyō-in. It is said that during the Shōtoku period (1711-1716), the monk Jun'yo Yuinen of Baisō-in in Aoyama, Edo, built the shrine building in Kyōhō 3 (1718) due to the divine blessing of this deity. The deity enshrined is Ichikishima-hime-no-kami, the same as the deity of Itsukushima in Geishū. The Asuwa deity of Watatsumi Village is a male deity, while this shrine is

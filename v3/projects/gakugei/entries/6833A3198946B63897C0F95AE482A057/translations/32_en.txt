Dedicated Cast Bronze Bell
Great Bodhisattva of Katsushika Hachiman, First Guardian Shrine of Shimōsa Province, Eastern Region of Great Japan
According to tradition, during the Kanpyō era, a shrine hall was built as Emperor Uda's imperial prayer temple, and since the Kenkyū era, the Right General has shown exceptional veneration. With heaven long and earth eternal, the great sea spreads in front and distant villages stretch behind. Moving with the nature of Kyoto insects, the dawn voice of the duck bell awakens people from the sleep of battle, and the night sound of golden revelation eternally removes worldly desires and well attests to enlightenment.

Tsutsugayu Shinji (Rice Porridge Divination Ritual) ⟨This ritual takes place every year on the morning of January 15th. Many people visit to learn about the year's harvest prospects⟩ Hōjōe (Release of Living Beings Ceremony) ⟨Performed on August 15th. On this day, the portable shrine is carried⟩

⟨Also on the same day, there is something called Tsukumiya. Around 7 o'clock in the evening, shrine personnel gather and erect a long pole like a ship's mast wrapped in white cloth in front of the torii gate, tying the white cloth together at the top to serve as footholds for prayers⟩

⟨A person becomes light-bodied and climbs to the top of said pole, worships the four directions, worships toward the shrine, and then descends. This ritual also exists at Hinata Yakushi in Sagami Province, where it is called Suitō. The purpose is similar. Also, beneath that Tsukumiya pole⟩

⟨a performance stage is set up, and when the portable shrine returns to the shrine, performers dressed as lions, monkeys, and large birds emerge from this stage and dance to flutes and drums. From the 14th to the 18th day, there is a ginger market. Hence, the common people call it the Ginger Festival. "Machi" is a contracted form of "matsuri" (festival)⟩

This shrine is an imperial prayer temple of Emperor Uda, being a sanctuary where Iwashimizu Shōhachimangū was invited during the Kanpyō era. Much later, in the Kenkyū era, Kamakura Shogun Yoritomo restored the decayed and deteriorating shrine buildings, making the sacred precincts broad and magnificent. However, after years and years, it has now become a divine enclosure with ancient trees growing luxuriantly.

⟨Upon examination, this shrine, like the provincial temples, is a Hachiman shrine serving as the first shrine of the province, probably the one that was established in the ancient provincial capital⟩

Hachiman Shirazu no Mori (Hachiman Unknown Forest) - Same location. Along the right side of the highway, there is a deep forest measuring no more than twenty steps square. It is said to be the site where Hachiman Shrine was originally enshrined in ancient times. There is a small stone shrine in the forest. The village elders say that if anyone mistakenly enters this area, divine retribution will surely follow, so they forbid it. Therefore, it is surrounded by a fence.

⟨One theory states that long ago, when Prince Taira no Masakado was struck by Taira no Sadamori's arrow and killed by Hidesato, six retainers who claimed to be his close vassals came to this place following his severed head. During that time, anyone who stepped on this forest would surely face divine punishment, causing great fear and terror. Another person says that while the area surrounding this forest entirely belongs to Hachiman territory, only the forest land belongs to Gyōtoku. For this reason, although it is within Hachiman village, since it belongs to another village, it came to be written as "Hachiman no Hachiman shirazu" (Hachiman's unknown Hachiman)⟩

⟨Incidentally, upon examination, Hachiman was anciently the name of a manor. Among the treasures of Nakayama, in a document by Chiba-no-suke Kanetane from the 27th year of Ōei, it records "Shimōsa Province Hachiman Manor, Honmyōji, Hokkeji, Kōbōji three temple administrative positions, etc., the same manor's Sotani village fields and residences, etc." It should serve as evidence. However, it is known that both the Mama area and Sotani belonged to Hachiman Manor⟩

Sotani Myōken-son (Sotani Myōken Deity) - Enshrined at Chōkokusan Ankokuji in Sotani Village. It is made from the same wood as the Myōken-son of Chibaji Temple in this province, carved from its remaining wood. Within the temple grounds is Ōgishi-no-miya. The plaque on the torii reads "Jin Ōkō-byō" (Shrine of Prince Jin), written by Useki Katsushin.

The meaning of this poem: Wondering if it's the loneliness of my own dwelling, I step outside to gaze, and realize that the loneliness of autumn evening is the same everywhere - a heart that has come to understand even others' circumstances. According to Genshi, the meaning is generally clear, and one should have the same feelings everywhere. Troubled by the unbearable loneliness of my dwelling, wondering if I should go anywhere, I step outside and gaze, only to find that nowhere is beyond what my own heart feels.
○Seasonal commentary: Stepping outside my dwelling to find some relief from loneliness, but since there are no dwellings other than autumn ones, the heart's distress is evident.

The meaning of this poem: When evening comes, the autumn wind rises faintly, making the rice plants in the gate field sway, and following autumn's arrival, they rustle with sound, coolly announcing each evening's arrival to the reed hut. According to the priest's interpretation, a reed hut refers to one made entirely of reeds. When one sees the autumn evening wind blowing gently through the rice plants in the gate field, without even listening, one immediately feels the atmosphere of the reeds.
○The seasonal commentary states: The farming household directly captures and conveys the mood of the autumn wind.

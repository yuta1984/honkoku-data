Poem:
The cuckoo
　crying
　passes by
　over the mountain ridge
Wishing for one more call,
　the moon
　remains

The heart of this poem expresses waiting for the cuckoo through many nights, hearing its indifferent passing call as if in a dream, and gazing at the directionless sky to find only the dawn moon remaining. The deep longing for the cuckoo shows endless refinement. While there are many poems that express various concerns about the cuckoo, this one, through subtle expression alone, exhausts the heart's capacity. It might be called the finest of cuckoo poems.
○Seasonal note: With the dawn moon remaining, the atmosphere of daybreak is clearly visible

The heart of this poem expresses that there is no path to escape this sorrowful world, and even when one retreats to hide in the mountain depths, there too the deer cry mournfully, showing one's weariness with the world. According to Genshi's interpretation, the poem's heart takes various sorrowful matters of the world and, thinking "this is the end," retreating deep into the mountains, hears the deer crying sorrowfully and realizes that even in the mountain depths there are sorrows of the world, lamenting that there is truly no path to escape from the world.
○Seasonal note: Even in the mountain depths where one tries to hear nothing, there are the voices of the pine winds speaking of various things

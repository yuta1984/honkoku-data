The meaning of this poem: Someone had been visiting this lady, but since the night had grown late, now the barrier gates would have opened, so please return quietly. The allusion comes from ancient China, where there was a man called Lord Mengchang who, having lost in battle, tried to pass through Hangu Pass late at night when the barrier gates would not open. Among his retainers was one called Keimei who could skillfully imitate a rooster's crow, so thinking dawn had come, they opened the barrier gates and let him pass. Though he passed through deception then, now after "kinuginu" (the morning after), even through deception the barrier gates would not yet be opened. This story is written in detail in Goshūishū, Volume 16, Miscellaneous 2.

The meaning of this poem: This is passionate love. Even occasional approaches are only through intermediaries. Even if I were to die of love without meeting her, I would want to approach her directly, not through others, and die. Now I lament that I should just give up these feelings entirely. In the headnote to Goshūishū Volume 13, Love 3, it says he composed this when "he had been secretly visiting someone who had returned from the vicinity of Ise Shrine, but when the Emperor heard of this and assigned guards and such, making it impossible to visit even in secret."

○The go-between should come and go to make arrangements,
and the groom's side should send congratulatory
gifts for the betrothal. This is commonly called
"tanomi" (request). Once this ceremony is performed,
it becomes the beginning ceremony of a
marital promise that cannot be
changed twice. In ancient times it was written as "yuiire"
(words inserted). In modern times it is written as "yuinō"
(tied gift). This conforms well to
proper reasoning. The general contents should be:
upper class - seven loads, seven kinds; middle class - five loads,
five kinds; lower class - three loads, three kinds.

To the father-in-law also sword, catalog, barrel,
and fish; to the mother-in-law also kosode robe, barrel,
and fish - all should be sent
according to one's means.
From the father-in-law to the groom's side, congratulatory
gifts should also be of equal status. From the woman
to the husband, there is no need to send anything.

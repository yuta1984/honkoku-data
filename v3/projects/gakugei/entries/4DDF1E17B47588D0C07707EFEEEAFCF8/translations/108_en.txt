Now, the twelve-layered court dress (jūnihitoe) is the formal attire worn by court nobles, and it is of no benefit for middle-class people and below to know about it. First, women's formal dress should primarily be in black or red fabric. White fabric and turmeric yellow come second. Other dyed colors are not suitable for formal wear. The undergarment beneath the outer robe should be crimson silk crepe.

Now, as there are differences in patterns between court style, warrior house style, and townspeople's style, it cannot be generalized. Although townspeople do not use plain-sewn patterns, since they are worn by people of high rank, one should be respectful of this.

Now, cotton-padded clothing is worn until March 30th, lined clothing from April 1st. Summer kimono (katabira) from May 5th. For katabira, black fabric, white fabric, and turmeric are considered important. Now, although lined clothing is appropriate from August 1st, since the lingering summer heat does not abate at all in early August, thinking that lined clothing should be worn from September 1st is an error. Cotton-padded clothing is worn from September 9th.

For clothing displayed on clothing racks, seasonal colors should be given first priority. Spring is blue, summer is red, midsummer (doyō period) is yellow, autumn is white, winter is black - one should understand that seasonal colors take precedence.

The meaning of this poem is that "Arima-yama" is a makurakotoba (pillow word) used to introduce "ina no sasahara." When I was secretly in love, someone asked if I had not yet forgotten that person, so I replied with this poem asking how I could forget so quickly. It was composed when a man who had grown cold expressed concern. This is a jo-uta (introductory poem). To say "ide soyo," she uses "ina no sasahara kaze fukeba."
○The seasonal commentary states: In the phrase "ide soyo wasure ya wa suru" (come now, would I forget?), the implication is that while people may be quick to forget, I would not forget in such a manner.

The meaning of this poem is one of regret. When a certain person promised "certainly" but did not visit, she regretted that her feelings had become apparent. Therefore, since this is a woman's poem, it is fitting. If it were a man's poem, it would not be like this. Genji Hōin says that she hesitated and stayed awake, waiting with hope "what if he comes," and then regretted it.

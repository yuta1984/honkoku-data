Even if married to someone of shallow wisdom
All are matters of predestined bonds
So do not despise your husband, and never
Speak back to him with harsh words
Do not speak unasked about the good rumors
Of your parental home
It sounds presumptuous even to listeners
Now, regarding fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law
Since they are originally strangers through marriage
It is rare for hearts to truly align
No matter how bad a person may be
There are also good things about them
Do not pay attention to their bad points
Focus on the good and try to get along

Even when they say trivial things
First respond appropriately and pleasantly
Watch for the right moment when they're in good spirits
Then quietly speak your reasoning
When anyone is angry
They won't listen properly even to good advice
Starting with relatives
And extending to all the neighbors and visitors
Do not alienate even difficult people
If your manner with people is poor
Even regular visitors will become distant
Causing great losses to the household in all matters
Being good with people is a matter of character
Do not doubt without observing their conduct

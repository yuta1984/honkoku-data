The heart of this poem is that Nara no Ogawa is a famous place. It is a river where everyone performs monthly purification. The wind rustling through the oak trees above is what he refers to. It would be a cool scene. Though evening deepens and one thinks tomorrow will come, because it is this evening, it is probably called summer only because of the purification rituals. The autumn atmosphere doesn't wait for purification. This is a ritual of moving the Nagoshi purification early into autumn. It is well composed to match this.
○Kigin's commentary notes that "rustling" cannot be said without something above, so he uses the oak trees. The wind rustling, the river, the evening—all are cool things, so the only sign of summer is the purification ritual.

The heart of this poem is that "people too are dear" expresses his compassionate thoughts for the people of the realm. However, the world does not conform to his imperial will, and in this age when the royal way declines, his concern for the people also makes him feel that "people are resentful," troubling his heart. Therefore, he composed this poem expressing his melancholy thoughts about the tasteless world. What a gracious imperial heart this shows—he grieves unnecessarily. That there are places his virtuous influence doesn't reach is something even the sage emperors Yao and Shun had to accept, so this represents his precious concern that precedes the sorrows of the realm.

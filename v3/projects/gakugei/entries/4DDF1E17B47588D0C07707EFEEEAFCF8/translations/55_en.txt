The Hōshōji Regent loved flowers and birds. Hōshōji Temple was built by Lord Teishin (Fujiwara no Tadahira), and because the abbot Son'i was Teishin's teacher and patron, it came to be called Hōshōji.

The meaning of this poem: "Wada no hara" is a general name for the sea. Rowing a boat far out and gazing, truly the clouds and waves become one, stretching endlessly into the distance. "Hisakata no" is a makurakotoba (pillow word) for clouds. This poem skillfully evokes the scenery of the seashore. Its lingering emotion is boundless. It was composed when the New Retired Emperor was on the throne, for the topic "Distant View of the Sea." According to Priest Genshi, the meaning is clear—it describes the poet himself going out in a boat. Generally, poems on the topic of scenic views are always composed as if merely gazing from afar, but this one, being composed from aboard a ship, has an even more charming quality.

The meaning of this poem: Though waves broken against rocks in a swift current separate and eventually reunite downstream, the relationship between you and me becomes difficult to restore once broken. "Warete mo" means the same as "wari naku mo" (even unreasonably). Like waves hitting rocks that separate but meet again at the end, he wishes there might be some way to meet again. According to Priest Genshi, the meaning is: "Water blocked by rocks separates but meets again downstream. After parting from a cruel person, meeting again is difficult, but thinking of meeting again at the end, even unreasonably, is a fleeting hope."
○The seasonal commentary explains that "blocked by rocks" expresses the heart that cannot meet, while "even if separated" expresses the heart that thinks to meet by all means.

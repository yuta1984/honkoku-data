○Priestly Prelate Henshō
His secular name was Yoshimine no Munesada. He was called Kazan Priestly Prelate. Known as Monk Henshō. He was the son of Monjū Jirō Ryō no Yasuyo. He became a palace guard early and was especially favored by Emperor Ninmyō. In the third month of Kashō 3 (850), Emperor Ninmyō passed away. Unable to bear his grief and longing, he climbed Mount Hiei and shaved his head. Details are recorded in the "Genkō Shakusho." The "Yamato Monogatari" also records this account. The theory that he became a monk because of scandalous rumors with Emperor Saga's empress is false. He died on the nineteenth day of the first month of Kanpei 2 (890) at age seventy-six.

The meaning of this poem is: O wind that blows the clouds, please block the pathway of the clouds, so that I might briefly hold and gaze upon the maiden's figure. The Kokinshū states this was "composed upon seeing a Gosechi dancer," so it should be attributed to Munesada, but here it is attributed to Henshō after his ordination. This poem likens the present dancer to ancient celestial maidens. Therefore, thinking of the dance's afterglow, he says "block the pathway of clouds." By saying "briefly," one hears the heart that cannot detain her. This is not about being infatuated with the dancer, but about expressing the beauty of the dance. High Priest Gen'shi said that Gosechi affairs are not recorded in the "Nihon Shoki" but appear in a work called "Honchō Getsuryō."

The meaning of this poem is: no matter how great a river, its source is merely droplets falling from beneath moss, gathering together until it becomes a river with unknowable depths. The faint glimpse of someone first seen, when such feelings accumulate, becomes a heart difficult to suppress—this is the metaphor. Mount Tsukuba and the Mina River are all famous places in Hitachi Province. This river is said to flow east into the Sakura River. From Tsukuba peak it flows underground beneath the sand, not appearing as a river but flowing in a single sweep until it becomes a river at the end. This is generally a jo (preface) poem. The poem's meaning is roughly as described. Being a love poem, perhaps the heart finds it interesting. For one in the emperor's position, even small thoughts have consequences—good becomes virtue for the realm, evil becomes the realm's sorrow. Ordinary people too should consider this heart according to their station.

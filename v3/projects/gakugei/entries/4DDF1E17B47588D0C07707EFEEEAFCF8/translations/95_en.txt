　Early Spring　Reply
As you indicated,
the year has turned anew,
　　　　　　　　so the atmosphere
in all directions
　　　　is even more
peaceful,
　　　　which I find
most auspicious.
That person must surely
be enjoying great liveliness,
I respectfully surmise.
May the celebrations of countless generations be
auspicious.
　　　　　Respectfully

Tomorrow there will be
a pilgrimage to the temple for the equinox,

let us go
together. We will bring
　　　　　　　a small
lunch. We eagerly await
your arrival in this direction.
We shall bring both
　　　　　　　children
with us.

to those of lower
station among the common people,
teaching calligraphy
first
is the same in every country.

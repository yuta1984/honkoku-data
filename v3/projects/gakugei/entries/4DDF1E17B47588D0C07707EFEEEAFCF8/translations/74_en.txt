May the reign of our lord continue
　for a thousand, nay, eight thousand generations,
　until pebbles grow into mighty rocks
　and moss grows upon them
May the reign of our lord be like heavenly robes rarely worn,
　lasting forever like enduring rock
Just because spring is said to arrive,
　Mount Yoshino too appears hazy
　this morning

July is called "Fumitsuki" (Letter Month) because it is when one airs out
documents to prevent insect damage, hence the name. Obon is
a Buddhist ceremony that Mokuren held on the 15th day for his
mother's sake. In Japan, it began when Emperor Shōmu first
held it in the 7th month of Tenpyō 5 (733 CE).
In this month, when all people dance, it is because autumn follows the ritsu scale (minor mode),
and people's hearts also become melancholy, so dancing was begun
to lift their spirits. Also, the lanterns lit at
each house's gate are said to be for the deceased. In a poem:
　I light this fire to illuminate the dark path of the dead—
　　The fisher-girl dances for her own sake
The Tanabata festival is called Kikkōden because it is for
wishing for good things. Five-colored threads are hung
on bamboo poles, and offerings are prepared. It is said that
if you pray earnestly for anything, it will surely
be fulfilled within three years.

Since that evening
when the person I saw
　　became
　　　smoke,
why has
　　Shiogama
　　　　Bay
become so
　　dear to me?

I thought
the dew that falls
　was only
　　on grass
　　　leaves,
but even my sleeves
　　are wet—
autumn has
　　come
　　　indeed

such is

since I am not

Whether I resent or

　　on that night
　　　I saw

A Collection of Tanabata Poems
　The offerings prayed for at Tanabata must be numerous indeed
　　The words on the kaji leaves that return at dawn
　All night long we offer to the sky where stars meet
　　The incense smoke will surely become clouds
　The koto placed in the garden on the night when Tanabata lovers meet—
　　Around it stretches a spider's thread
　Let the fragrant incense perfume the robes of clouds
　　As we await the evening of the Weaver Maid
　Offering a koto of white dewdrops strung like jewels
　　The autumn lanterns hung in the garden
　Building a weaving hut for Tanabata and weaving cloth—
　　Who dyed these autumn farewell robes?
　The lamp-wife who finds it hard to live by the Milky Way
　　Hurries to cross, this is an offering of sacred streamers
　Writing down all thoughts on the seven kaji leaves

　　Still there is more in this autumn evening
　Would they add to Tanabata's eternal vows?
　　The magpie bridge where wings align
　The Cowherd launches his heavenly stone boat
　　Tonight he rests with the shore as his pillow
　The future course of tonight's meeting at the Milky Way
　　They will pledge again for ten thousand generations
　Though it's only one night in a year, at Tanabata
　　The autumn meetings seem endless

As I grow accustomed,

this floating world

Only that day

but never again
　returns
the person
　so dear

at Matsushima
　　　
drawing near

the fisherman's boat

Spring still

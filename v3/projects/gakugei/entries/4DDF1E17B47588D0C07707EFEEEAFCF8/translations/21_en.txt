○Buddhist Monk Kisen
Said to be the same person who wrote the "Kashiki" (Poetic Rules). One theory states he is the same person as Kisen, while another says they are different people.
According to Kamo no Chōmei's "Mumyōshō" (Nameless Notes), about twenty chō into the mountains behind Mimuroto, there are remains of where Kisen of Mount Uji lived. Though there is no house, stone pagodas and such clearly remain. One should see this, it says.
In the "Genkō Shakusho" volume 18, "Shenxian Zhuan" (Biographies of Divine Immortals), it states: "Monk Kisen lived on Mount Uji, practiced secret mantras, sought longevity, avoided grains and consumed rice cakes. One day he rode on clouds and departed."
Are Kisen and Kisen (窺仙) the same person?

The meaning of this poem is that Monk Kisen built a hermitage in the southeast of the capital, on Mount Uji, and lives there. People say the world is sorrowful, but I rely on this and live so contentedly. "Southeast of the capital" refers to the direction. The Kokin preface also says "beginning and end are unclear," referring to where it should say "though people say the world is a sorrowful mountain" but says "people say." Also, when viewing the autumn moon meeting dawn clouds, it describes how the moon that was clear all night suddenly became clouded—this means the beginning and end are unclear.
○Kigin's commentary states: "I have long dwelt in a three-bay thatched cottage. Divine light exists among myriad realms. Do not grasp right and wrong. Come and understand my floating life. Analytical investigation is irrelevant."

○Ono no Komachi
Daughter of Ono no Hidesumi, provincial governor of Dewa, called Tsunezumi.
According to one theory, daughter of Ono no Yoshisane, provincial governor of Dewa, or daughter of Tsunesumi.
According to Lord Sankōin's explanation, daughter of Masasumi. During Emperor Ninmyō's time, around the Jōwa era.
The Kokinshū catalog and Jūgaishō state: "Daughter of the provincial governor of Dewa, during Emperor Ninmyō's time, around the Jōwa era."
According to "Tsurezuregusa," Ono no Komachi's circumstances are extremely unclear. Her declined state appears in a text called "Tamatsukuri Komachi." Though there is a theory that Kiyotsura wrote this text, it is included in the catalog of Kōbō Daishi's works. The master died in the early Jōwa period.

The meaning of this poem is lamenting one's aging in the world, expressing thoughts by comparing them to flowers. This is Komachi's foremost poem in the Kokinshū. It is a poem included later in that collection. This poem has surface and deeper interpretations. The surface meaning is that when flowers bloomed, I thought to become one with the flowers, but living in the world with many affairs, I was distracted by this and that and let the flowers pass unseen. They have faded. The deeper interpretation is that even one's own body is unknown to oneself. Seeing the flowers' decline, one thinks that one's own body must have similarly faded.
○Kigin's commentary says Komachi has many poems lamenting the decline of her beauty. Among them, this poem is particularly moving.

The heart of this poem is that though flowers are scattered by the storm and one might mistake them for snow without sweeping the path, the aging of one's own body is truly lamentable. This sentiment is expressed as "what falls is my own body." The transition from "not snow" to "what falls" is skillfully done.
○Kigin's commentary notes that in general, seeing falling flowers and leaves to realize the impermanence and change of all things existed even among the solitary enlightened ones before Shakyamuni on Vulture Peak.

The heart of this poem is that Matsuo no Ura is a famous place. He speaks of waiting for someone who doesn't come, describing the time of evening calm and pines. Speaking directly of burning seaweed salt and the things of Matsukaze no Ura, he compares his burning, yearning heart and waiting thoughts to salt being burned in the evening tide. In the evening when much smoke rises, as it grows dark all colors become like smoke—he uses this to compare his own burning, anguished thoughts. There seem to have been many such poems, but this one was included in the hundred poems collection.

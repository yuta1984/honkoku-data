The meaning of this poem: Travel provides riverside vistas. It is aesthetically pleasing how the ajiro-wood (fish-trap stakes) appear faintly through the intermittent mist of the Uji River. In the headnote to Senzaishū Volume 6, Winter section, it says "composed when visiting Uji." This draws from Hitomaro's poem: "At the ajiro-wood of the eighty Uji Rivers where warriors gather, the waves that hesitate know not where to go." Ajiro are devices for catching fish. It is said that ice fish that escape from the Tagami River in Ōmi are caught in the Uji River.
"Taetae" means intermittently, appearing and disappearing.

The meaning of this poem: Though sleeves that never dry from resentment and grief should decay, even they remain, yet I lament the name that will decay meaninglessly through love. Genshi commented: "The line 'how precious is the name that would decay from love' means that if it were a mutual love affair, at least there would be some merit in having one's name become known for it."

○In Kinote's commentary: "Lamenting in resentment is the painful way of things. That sleeves decay from incessant tears of parting shows ever-deepening feelings, and that even one's reputation should decay must be grief beyond what one can bear."

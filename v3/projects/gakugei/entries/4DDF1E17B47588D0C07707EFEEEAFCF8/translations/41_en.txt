Are these the waves

　　the rocks
　　　of the rough shore?

This heart that
　　returns to
　　　someone
　　indifferent

The meaning of this poem draws from a Man'yōshū poem about a mountain ascetic blowing a conch shell attached to his waist against rocks until it breaks during a time of contemplation. The indifferent person is like a rock, and no matter how many times the waves of longing crash against them, they scatter and break. Though I do not intend to fall in love by looking at this indifferent person, I naturally fall into contemplation.
○According to Kigin's commentary, one interpretation is "I alone in this world break my heart in contemplation."

The meaning of this poem: "mikakimori" refers to those who tend the watch fires at the great gates. "Eji" refers to the Guard Office. The fires these guards kindle also engage in contemplation only at night. This is a poem about contemplation during both day and night. Like the fires the guards kindle that burn at night, one should understand by adding the particle "te." According to Genshi, guards are warriors who serve under the Left Guard Office. The Left Guard Office protects the outer imperial fences.
The meaning is that because I avoid people's eyes, during the day it is like a fire going out, but at night it burns again.
According to Sōgi, during the day the thoughts are extinguished, appearing to rest from contemplation.

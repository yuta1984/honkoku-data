　In the first section of the Tales of Ise,
Minister Ariwara no Narihira
had holdings in
Kasuga village and when he went out
hunting there, he saw
very beautiful sisters
living in that place,
and his heart became restless, so
he tore off the shinobu-zuri
hunting robe he was wearing
and wrote a poem to send:
"The young purple
dyed robes of Kasuga fields—
the confusion of love
knows no bounds"
The woman replied with an old poem:
"The shinobu
pattern-dyeing of Michinoku—
because of whom
did this confusion begin?
It was not because of me"

　In the twenty-third section of the Tales of Ise,
Minister Narihira had
a lover in Kawachi
Province and visited her
every night, but
this woman showed no signs
of resentment and would send him off,
so the man thought suspiciously that
she must have feelings for another
and be acting this way, so
he hid in the garden
and pretended to go to Kawachi
　　　　　and watched,
whereupon he heard her compose:
"When the wind blows, the white waves
of the offing at Mount Tatsuta—
are you crossing alone
in the middle of the night?"
After hearing this,
he could no longer
go to Kawachi
　it is said

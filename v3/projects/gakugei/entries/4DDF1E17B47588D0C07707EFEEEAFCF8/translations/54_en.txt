The meaning of this poem is about love unfulfilled despite prayers. Though I prayed in various ways, hoping there might be some way to meet once, the person's coldness was fierce as a storm, making it all in vain—this is what the poem expresses. In the headnote to the twelfth book of love poems in the Senzai Collection, it says: "When composing ten love poems at the house of Provisional Middle Counselor Tadatada, this expressed the heart of love that remains unfulfilled despite prayers." Lord Teika's Eiga Shūi notes that seeing this poem, it was composed with deep feeling, and even if one studies following one's heart, it's difficult to continue and truly an unattainable style. The five syllables continue with "that cruel person..."

That cruel person—
I never prayed
that the harsh
mountain wind
of Hatsuse
would blow so fierce

The meaning of this poem: A certain monk relied on Mototoshi, hoping to become a lecturer at the Yuima-e (Vimalakīrti Assembly) in Nara, but was not selected. When Mototoshi complained to the Lord of Hōshōji about why this happened, it carries the same sentiment as the poem about the burning grass of Sagano. Also, when he was passed over again this autumn, Mototoshi composed this. In a world where the dew on the sagebrush is life itself—so brief—lamenting that this year's autumn has also passed him by again. According to Kuji Kongen, the Yuima-e is held for seven days from the 10th to 16th of the tenth month at Kōfukuji, where the Vimalakīrti Sutra is lectured. The 16th is the memorial day of the Great Minister (Fujiwara no Kamatari).
○Seasonal note: "Inumeri" means "has passed." The selection of lecturers should be decided during autumn.

The promised
sagebrush dew
as my very life—
alas, this year's
autumn too
has passed away

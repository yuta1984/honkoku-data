Dawn love reference poems:
The coldness
　and even its
　　　kind are
not harsh
　I also admired
　　the moon
　in the dawn sky

Meeting in sight
　even kindness
　　　is painful
　at dawn
where dew alone is deep
　in dreams
　　of parting

The meaning of this poem is about visiting someone but being met with coldness and unable to meet them, yet continuing to visit hoping "perhaps this time," but returning without success. The dawn moon remains coldly, and night breaks but without meeting there is the pain of parting - from this, nothing in the world is as painful as dawn, thinking this single-mindedly. This poem is a renowned one. This is about love that meets but lacks substance. There is a hundred-volume work called Fusō Yōrin-shū. It is a collection of poems from Emperor Saga's time onward. In it, this is listed as "love that returns without meeting." In other schools, it is "love that meets and parts." The meaning is clear along with the commentary on the right. This must truly be a poem with interesting technique.

The meaning of this poem is about viewing the plants and trees of Mount Yoshino at dawn, seeing the first snow falling thinly, white like the dawn moon. This clearly appears as a famous place's first snow theme. The commentary on this poem says it was composed when he went down to Yamato Province and saw snow falling. Now, asaborake is the time when night is breaking into dawn. Asatan, asarō, meitan - all are read as asaborake. One does not praise by calling it a village. Since the dawn moon is not in the sky but its light is here, seeing it closely, one composes like this.
○Seasonal note: The dawn moon has a faint reflection, yet is distinctly bright, so one mistakes it for thinly falling snow.

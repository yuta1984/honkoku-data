The heart of this poem is that Ojima is a famous place. Even though the fishermen's sleeves get wet, their color does not change. While the fishermen's sleeves of Ojima get wet, my sleeves never dry from tears, yet when anyone's sleeve color changes to crimson, there is something special about my sleeve that cannot be compared to the fishermen's sleeves. The poem expresses the desire to show this to others.

○Kigin's commentary states: "Though the fishermen's sleeves of Ojima may get wet, these are tears of deep feeling, and I want to show how intense my feelings are that even change the color."

I would show you—
even the fishermen's
sleeves at Ojima,
though they get thoroughly wet,
do not change color

The heart of this poem is about sleeping alone on a narrow mat during frosty nights, listening to crickets chirping near the bed, spending the long night in loneliness, pathos, and sadness until dawn. If one truly puts oneself in that person's place, it would indeed be elegant and deeply moving. A narrow mat is just a plain mat. By saying "narrow mat," it well expresses sleeping alone.
　　　　Thinking of the heart
　　　　of the Ashihiki
　　　　poem.

Crickets
cry on this frosty night—
on my narrow mat
with sorrowful robes,
shall I sleep alone?

"Bu" (martial) refers to one who is brave and resolute, possessing benevolence and righteousness. They devise strategies within military headquarters and determine victory thousands of miles away. They are protectors of the imperial court, subduing those who rebel against it. In ancient times, Michi-omi-no-mikoto and Yamato Takeru-no-mikoto served as military commanders. Later, Minamoto no Yoshiie and Yoritomo continued this tradition.

Military Equipment and Crests【in frame】
Only supreme commanders may depict dragon heads on their helmets. Dragons are used for decorations on the emperor's implements. Since supreme commanders receive imperial edicts to pacify enemies of the court, they are permitted to wear dragon forms on their helmets. The armor color is purple, the hem is crimson, and purple cords are used. This is what the supreme commander oversees. Crests generally represent the horns of fierce beasts. Gold color is generally used because it has the utility of dazzling the enemy's eyes.

Alternatively, mounting dragon heads on helmets and wearing face masks began with Prince Lanling of China.

The Meeting Between Kiyohara no Takenori and Chinjufu-shōgun Minamoto no Yoriyoshi

In the winter of Tenki 5 (1062), Minamoto no Yoriyoshi fought with his imperial forces of over 1,800 cavalry against Abe no Sadatō's forces of over 4,000 cavalry at Torinoumi in Ōshū Province. During this battle, fierce cold winds and heavy snowfall obscured the roads, cutting off all travel for many days. As a result, his allied forces ran out of provisions, became exhausted, and gained no advantage in battle. With only seven riders remaining of his lord and retainers, they barely managed to return to the Chinjufu headquarters. Afterward, he requested military assistance from Kiyohara no Mahito Takenori of Dewa Province. Takenori readily agreed and led his forces of over 10,000 cavalry to meet with the general at Tamuro-ga-oka in Kurihara District of this province. First, they appointed the various military commanders (ōryōshi) here. At that time, Takenori bowed toward the imperial palace and swore to heaven and earth: "I have already sent forth my sons and brothers to respond to the general's command. My intention is to uphold loyalty and righteousness, without regard for my own life." He spoke with utmost sincerity. All the military forces who heard this were moved to tears without exception. From then on, joining forces with Yoriyoshi, they encouraged military strategy and battlefield achievements, and finally destroyed Sadatō and Munetō. This occurred on the 9th day of the 8th month of Kōhei 5 (1062). End.

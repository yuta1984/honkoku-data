This province was the home territory of Taira no Tsunetsune, the main castle of Shimōsa Province. It was an impregnable fortress of unparalleled strategic importance. Facing thirty ri of sea with over twenty chō to cross, there were no boats available. Yorinobu observed the high tide timing and perceived the enemy's negligence, personally leading the vanguard as fifty thousand allies followed across. Tsunetsune had no means of defense and finally surrendered, dying of illness.

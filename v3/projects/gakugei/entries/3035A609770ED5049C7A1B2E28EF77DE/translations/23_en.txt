Minamoto no Yorinobu: Taira no Tsunetsune rebelled and fortified himself in a castle in Shimōsa Province. Yorinobu received an imperial command to subdue him. This castle had high mountains behind it and faced the sea for thirty ri in front, spanning over twenty chō—truly an impregnable strategic position. Moreover, Tsunetsune had hidden all the boats in the coastal areas, leaving the Minamoto forces no means to cross. Yorinobu then discovered shallow waters and advanced his horse at high tide. When his officers asked "What shall we do?" the general (Yorinobu) said, "At low tide, the enemy would be on guard. Now, at high tide, we shall attack," and led the charge across. His allied forces of over fifty thousand cavalry followed, and they finally destroyed Tsunetsune.

Minamoto no Yoriyoshi: When fighting against Abe no Yoritoki in Ōshū, it was the seventh day of the sixth month (Minazuki), and although it was already unbearably hot, no rain had fallen for several days. Water ran out, and the soldiers could no longer endure their thirst, creating a dangerous situation. Yoriyoshi then made a vow to the heavenly deities, asking for water, and struck the nearby riverbank with his bow nock. Suddenly, pure water gushed forth from the burning rock crevices. The soldiers drank this water to quench their thirst, and crying "This is heaven's aid!" they courageously advanced and finally drove back the enemy.

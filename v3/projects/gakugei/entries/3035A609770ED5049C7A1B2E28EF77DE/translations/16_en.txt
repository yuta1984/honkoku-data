Minamoto no Mitsunaka (Manchū)
【Within Corner-Cut Frame】Now, this Mitsunaka was a famous general of all ages and a wise ruler who valued benevolence and righteousness. His ancestor was, most reverently, the son of Prince Sadazumi, who was a son of Emperor Seiwa, and he was the eldest son of Rokuson'ō Tsunemoto, the Shōgun of Chinjufu. He respected the imperial court and showed compassion to the people as if they were his own children, and for the first time the world became peaceful during this era. Even when occasionally wicked people appeared, they could not achieve their evil intentions. The Genji clan prospered and the realm was at peace. The number of shrines and Buddhist temples he built was countless. At one time, a dragon maiden appeared in his dream and offered him a dragon horse. He made a pilgrimage to Sumiyoshi, shot a divine whistling arrow to subdue a great serpent, and obtained land to dwell upon. The sacred swords Higekiri and Hizamaru were treasures of the Genji clan for generations. It is said that he once carved his own image, declaring that he would become a guardian deity of archery for future generations, creating his own likeness. The place where that dragon maiden came and offered the dragon horse is illustrated on the left.

Lord Mitsunaka was enjoying hunting at the banks of Se in his domain of Settsu Province for four or five days. One night, a woman appeared before him. When he asked "What manner of person are you?", she replied, "I humbly present myself. I am a dragon maiden, and I have an enemy. Please defeat him and save me." Immediately Mitsunaka agreed, and the woman rejoiced and seemed to bring a dragon horse. When he awoke from his dream and looked around, there was indeed one extraordinary horse there.

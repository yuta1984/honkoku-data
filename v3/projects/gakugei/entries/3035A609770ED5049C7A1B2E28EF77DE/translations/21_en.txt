The illustration of Watanabe no Tsuna depicts the events of the night of April 10th in the 4th year of Ten'en era, when he was sent by Raikō as a messenger to Ichijō Ōmiya. Since night had fallen, he was given the sword "Higekiri" for protection on the road. At Modori Bridge in Ichijō Horikawa, he encountered a suspicious woman. The woman spoke familiarly, saying "I am going to the Gojō area. Please escort me." Tsuna thought she was suspicious, jumped down from his horse and said "That's easy enough. Please mount this horse," and helped her onto it. On the way, the woman transformed into a terrifying demon and grabbed Tsuna's hair to carry him away. Without panicking, Tsuna swiftly drew Higekiri and cleanly cut off the demon's hand in mid-air. The supernatural being disappeared, its whereabouts unknown.

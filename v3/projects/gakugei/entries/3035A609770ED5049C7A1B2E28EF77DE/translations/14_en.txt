When Empress Jingu invaded the Three Kingdoms of Korea, she threw the tide-filling jewel that had been offered from the Dragon Palace, causing the tide to surge and the enemy soldiers to drown in the flood. Therefore, the Empress won the battle.

This was entirely due to the divine power of the jewels that control the tides.

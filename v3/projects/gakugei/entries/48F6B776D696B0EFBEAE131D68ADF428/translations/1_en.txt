Preface
The ancient sages once said: Rather than having school education be lofty but insufficient, it is better that it be humble but widely accessible. In the early autumn of this year, by imperial command, the establishment of schools and academies began in both urban and rural districts. This guidance of the children of common people is truly a blessing of civilization and enlightenment, and the benevolent influence of good governance.

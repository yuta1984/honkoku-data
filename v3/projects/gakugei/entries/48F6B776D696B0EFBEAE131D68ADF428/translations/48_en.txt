Imperial Products Correspondence (Kōkoku Sanbutsu Ōrai)
Original manuscript by Master Katayama Kin of Western Capital, supplemented by Masaki Shōtarō

This book is a compilation of the products of our nation, including not only goods exported far overseas, but also newly manufactured items, rare implements, unusual crafted articles, and even playthings, all recorded without omission. Furthermore, through the teacher's years of labor, the correct characters for product names have been researched, and the places of origin - countries and districts - where these items are produced have been documented. Since this has been compiled as reading material for children, young students who have just entered school can quickly memorize this book, and thereby come to understand the prosperous and strong character of Japan's land and climate. This is truly a book that can be called a treasure volume of our current age.

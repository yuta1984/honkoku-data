Parting from Someone at Lu Creek - Wang Changling

At the creek mouth of Wuling, a small boat is moored,
The creek water follows you, flowing northward.
When you travel to Jingmen and ascend the Three Gorges,
Do not let the solitary moon confront the sorrow of gibbons.

Since your departure by boat from Wuling Creek is so regrettable, I stop the boat to look at the creek water. How enviable that the water follows you flowing north, while I, with a body that cannot even match the water, cannot go with you. What a pity! When you reach the Jingmen area and ascend places like the Three Gorges, where there are many gibbons, if you see the moon with your eyes and hear gibbons with your ears, it will add to your melancholy and loneliness. Be careful not to listen to the gibbon cries while gazing at the solitary moon. During lonely moonlit nights, gibbons cry all the more. For details, one should consult the annotations.

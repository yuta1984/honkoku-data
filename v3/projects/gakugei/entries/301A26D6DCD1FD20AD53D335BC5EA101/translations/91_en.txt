"Song from the Frontier" by Chang Jian

With jade and silk tribute, returning from court, gazing toward the imperial capital
The Wusun having returned, no longer claim the title of king
In quiet places at heaven's edge, there are no military campaigns
The martial energy has dissipated to become the light of sun and moon

The barbarian king, longing for and revering the imperial capital, came to pay tribute and submitted to China, bringing jade and silk for court audience. Although these barbarians had previously claimed royal titles, the Wusun too submitted to China and no longer call themselves kings. All is peacefully governed to the ends of heaven with no征campaigns or battles. When there are wars, martial energy spreads across the sky, but this too has dissipated, and the sun and moon shine clearly, creating an era of great peace. Such things happened in ancient times. This speaks of the time when there was a good emperor.

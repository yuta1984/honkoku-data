Once becoming an exile, departing to Changsha
Looking west toward Chang'an, I cannot see my home
In Yellow Crane Tower, playing a jade flute
In river city's fifth month, plum blossoms fall

Listening to flute playing atop Yellow Crane Tower with Administrator Shi Qin

Li Bai

Having been banished from the capital and come to Changsha, Chang'an is my distant hometown. Even looking toward Chang'an, I cannot see my home. Both you (Administrator Shi Qin) and I have become exiles, and when I think that we have come to such a remote place, I become ever more sorrowful. Yellow Crane Tower is called "river city" because it is located by a river. While feeling melancholy, someone plays a jade flute in that tower, continuing to play the melody "Falling Plum Blossoms." Unexpectedly, in the fifth month, hearing this tune makes me remember and long for the capital. Details can be found in historical records.

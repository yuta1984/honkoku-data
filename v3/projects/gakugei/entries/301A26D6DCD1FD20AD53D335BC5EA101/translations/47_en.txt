Song of Following the Army (Jūgunkō)
　　By Wang Changling (Ōshōrei)

The bright moon of Qin times, the passes of Han times—
Ten thousand li campaigners have not yet returned.
If only we could have the Flying General of Dragon City present,
The barbarian horses would not be allowed to cross the Yin Mountains.

This is nothing new. It was the same in the Qin and Han dynasties. There were times when expeditions built what were called courts (capitals) and attacked. Even then, those who came to battle looked upon this bright moon and grieved, thinking of their homeland. The Han period also came and fought, but since the Qin and Han dynasties, no one has returned. Because there are no good generals, the barbarians threaten the capital. If only there were someone like the Flying General whom the barbarians fear, the barbarians would not invade Tang China. That there are no good generals is unavoidable. This poem has its excellence in being both easy and difficult to interpret.

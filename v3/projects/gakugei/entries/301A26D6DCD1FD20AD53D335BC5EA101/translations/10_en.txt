Mang Mountain　　　　Shen Quanqi

On North Mang Mountain, tombs are arranged in rows
For ten thousand ages and a thousand autumns, facing Luo City
In the city, day and evening, songs and bells arise
On the mountain, one hears only the sound of pines and cypresses

Mang Mountain is located to the north of Luoyang, where there are many burial sites where people have been interred. For a thousand years since ancient times, it has been near this capital, facing Luo City. Now when one comes to this place and observes, the city is bustling with singing, dancing, and musical accompaniment, but atop this mountain one hears only the lonely sound of pines and cypresses. Yet the poem suggests that though people may enjoy themselves as if they will live for a thousand years, it is human destiny that they will eventually be buried here.

Song of the Green Tower by Wang Changling

With white horses and golden saddles following the martial emperor, a hundred thousand banners lodge at Chanyang Palace
A small lady atop the tower sits playing the zither, gazing far at flying dust entering Jianzhang Palace

White horses with golden saddles follow the martial emperor; a hundred thousand banners camp at Chanyang Palace.
A young woman on the tower sits playing the zither, watching from afar as dust clouds enter Jianzhang Palace.

This admonishes Emperor Xuanzong's fondness for women, describing the displeasure of warriors. These philandering warriors, riding white horses and accompanying the emperor's entertainments, make a splendid sight. They set up banners in rows and lodge at Chanyang Palace. While these hundred thousand or so men play zithers and such instruments while seated, they cast sidelong glances at their young male companions entering Jianzhang Palace in the distance. Setting this aside, it speaks of the interesting romantic sentiments between those of noble birth who gaze at each other.

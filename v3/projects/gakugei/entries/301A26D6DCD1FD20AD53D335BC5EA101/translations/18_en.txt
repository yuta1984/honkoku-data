Song of the Moon over Mount Emei

The half moon of autumn over Mount Emei, its reflection flows in the Pingqiang River
Departing at night from Clear Creek toward the Three Gorges, thinking of you but cannot see, going down to Yuzhou

Riding a boat and passing under this mountain, I see that half the moon is covered by the mountain, and its reflection enters and flows in the river water. Taking a boat through this Clear Creek valley toward the Three Gorges area, it becomes too dark to see. I think that if I go to the Yuzhou area, I might see the moon a little, so I travel down Clear Creek. This speaks of the extreme speed of the boat. It's about going downstream from upriver. "Jun" (you) refers to the moon.

Li Bai

Wang Yuanmei said: "This is Taibai's excellent verse of twenty-eight characters containing five place names - Mount Emei, Pingqiang River, Clear Creek, Three Gorges, and Yuzhou - yet it makes later people unable to bear the traces, which is the wonder of this old master's skill."

After this, Song dynasty's Su Zizhan and others praised this poem and tried to follow this style, but they say it is difficult to reach Taibai's wondrous realm.

Respectfully Harmonizing with Yan Wu's "Early Autumn at the Military Fort" by Du Fu

The autumn wind sways gracefully, moving the tall banners; in the jade tent dividing bows to shoot at the barbarian camp
Already having captured the garrison at Dibo among the clouds, now wanting to seize the city of Pengpo beyond the snow

Since it is autumn, the wind blows gracefully, making the banners erected high in the military camp flutter. Being a time of military expedition, many have gathered in the general's tent, and he distributes bows, assigns roles, telling them to shoot arrows at the barbarian camp and engage in battle. Having already won the battle, General Yan Wu has captured the enemy territory of Dibo, so watchtowers are erected in the high places among the clouds of that land, and guards are stationed there. Riding on this victory, they also plan to capture all of the Pengpo area and bring it under their command.

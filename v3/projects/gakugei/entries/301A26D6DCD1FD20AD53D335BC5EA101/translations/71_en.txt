"Written at Muxu Beacon Tower, Sent to Family" by Cen Shen

At Muxu Beacon Tower I encounter the beginning of spring
On Hulu River tears moisten my kerchief  
In the women's quarters she only thinks of me in vain
Not seeing how the battlefield brings sorrow and death to men

【Modern Translation and Commentary】
At the frontier fortress, the spring scenery appears, and feeling moved that spring has already arrived, I think of how last year at the beginning of spring I was together with my wife and children. Thinking of my hometown and feeling sad, my tears never have time to dry.

In the women's quarters (wife's room), she must be thinking of me and worrying, but it is futile. The travel sorrows that I now experience here are unbearable. Because she does not know the conditions of this battlefield, she probably doesn't think much of it, but if she were to see it, she would be even more saddened.

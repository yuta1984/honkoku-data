The famous flower and the kingdom-toppling beauty both rejoice together
Constantly able to see with the sovereign's smile
Dispelling the infinite resentment of the spring wind
North of Chenxiang Pavilion, leaning against the railing

The flower is gazed upon by someone like Consort Yang Guifei, and Guifei also looks at the flower - both rejoicing together. The "famous flower" refers to the peony. Both the famous peony flower and the beautiful Guifei are favored. The sovereign looks at this flower and shows his smile. Because she is beloved, they rejoice together in this way. Even in the flower's heart, there is the apprehension that when the spring wind blows, it will eventually be scattered. It is women's nature to constantly think, whenever spring winds blow, "Will my beauty fade and will his love also wane?" - an endless resentment. But Guifei has no such resentment and dispels it. As the emperor, with no worries in his heart, he enjoys looking at the flowers, and together with his beloved, leaning against the railing north of Chenxiang Pavilion, he loves the peonies without any resentment.

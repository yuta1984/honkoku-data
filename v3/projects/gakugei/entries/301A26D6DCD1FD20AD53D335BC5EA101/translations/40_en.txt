"Lament of the Inner Quarters" by Wang Changling

The young woman in the inner quarters knows no sorrow, applying elaborate makeup on a spring day and ascending the emerald tower.
Suddenly seeing the color of the roadside willows, she regrets having encouraged her husband to seek feudal rank.

Having never left her parents' care nor been separated from her husband, knowing nothing of sorrow,
she thought to view the spring scenery and, arranging her appearance, climbed the tall tower to look out.
Suddenly seeing the color of the roadside willows and feeling spring's passage, she remembered her husband
and thought how regrettable it was that when her husband departed, he said "I go to the military camp, and if I
achieve merit I shall become a great lord," so she sent him off, but now thinking back, how regrettable, what a foolish thing
she did, lamenting meaninglessly—how poignant.

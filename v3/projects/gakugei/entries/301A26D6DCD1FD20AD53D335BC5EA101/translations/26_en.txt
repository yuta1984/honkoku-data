Accompanying Uncle Yao, Vice Minister of Justice, and Jia Zhi, Secretary of the Central Secretariat, on an Excursion to Dongting Lake

Looking west from Dongting, the Chu River divides
Where the waters end and southern sky meets, no clouds are seen
The sun sets over Changsha, autumn colors stretch far
I know not where to pay respects to Lord Xiang

Uncle refers to father's younger brother. "Accompanying" means serving as a companion. This is a poem composed while boating together on Dongting Lake. Secretary Jia composed this in response to a poem. "Gazing across the 800-li lake, it extends endlessly to the southern horizon - how vast it is! Dongting Lake has the Chu River flowing in from the west, and to the south it extends to the horizon - truly expansive. As the sun sets and I gaze distantly at the autumn scenery around Changsha, when Jia Zhi speaks of 'white clouds and bright moon paying respects to Lord Xiang' - if we continue our boat journey like this, we might reach Lord Xiang's dwelling." In response to this, he says "I know not" - what are you saying? It's so vast that one cannot tell where anything is.

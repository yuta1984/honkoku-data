Seeing Off the Daoist Master Sima on His Journey to Mount Tiantai　　　Song Zhiwen

The feathered guest's reed pipe and songs now depart from this place
At the farewell banquet in several locations, white clouds fly
Long will you be remembered beneath the Penglai Palace
Having departed for the peak of Tongbai Mountain, you will not return

The music of the feathered guest (Daoist) - his reed pipes and songs - are not something ordinary people can easily hear, but we have been blessed to hear this person's music. Now that he is departing from this place, this will be the last time. Looking at the farewell banquet, everywhere white clouds drift as if they have come to escort the Daoist master. Now that he has departed for Tongbai Mountain, he will likely never return to this place again. Long will he remember us from beneath the Penglai Palace in the imperial court. Penglai Palace refers to the emperor's palace, and Tongbai is another name for Mount Tiantai.

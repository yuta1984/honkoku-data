Seeing Off Liang Liu　　　Zhang Yue

From Baling I gaze upon autumn over Dongting Lake
Daily I see a solitary peak floating upon the waters
I hear that immortals cannot be approached
My heart follows the lake waters, together drifting endlessly

Looking at Dongting Lake from Baling Commandery, there are no clouds or mist across the entire vista, and every day I can see a solitary peak - a lone island - floating upon the waters of Dongting. You will use that distant peak as your destination, concealing your traces to practice the Daoist way. Once you become an immortal, you will dwell in such lofty heights that mortals cannot commune with you - this cannot be helped. But since that place remains visible day after day, I will think of you, and my heart will drift endlessly like the lake waters, boundless in its longing.

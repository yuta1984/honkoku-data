Viewing Ancient Ruins at Su Terrace

Old gardens and ruined terraces, willows newly green
Water chestnut songs clearly sung, unbearable in spring
Only now there remains the moon over the western river
That once illuminated the people in the Wu king's palace

This is said to be the historic site of the Wu king. Surely in ancient times the palaces and such were magnificent, but now there is no trace left. Spring continues to change as always, and the willows welcome new green leaves. Now it has become an open field, and only people gathering water chestnuts come and go singing songs. Everywhere is spring, but it has completely changed from the past. Only the moon remains now, while the palace has left no trace. Only the moon that once illuminated the palace ladies remains unchanged from ancient times. This illustration depicts the scene of the ancient Wu king's palace.

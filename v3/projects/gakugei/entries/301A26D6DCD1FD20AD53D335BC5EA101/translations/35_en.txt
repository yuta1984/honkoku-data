Spring Resentment in the Western Palace by Wang Changling

In the western palace the night is quiet, a hundred flowers fragrant; wanting to roll up the pearl curtain, spring resentment grows long
Leaning sideways holding the cloud-harmony zither, gazing deeply at the moon; through hazy tree shadows, Zhaoyang Palace lies hidden

The Western Palace is the Changxin Palace where Ban Jieyu resides. In the Western Palace, a court lady sits alone. While the night is quiet and flowers bloom fragrantly, she thinks to view these flowers and tries to roll up the pearl curtain, but feels dispirited. Even viewing the spring scenery brings melancholy, so she abandons the attempt. "Cloud-harmony" refers to a zither. Overwhelmed by melancholy, trying somehow to dispel her sorrow, she leans sideways and plays the zither. Looking at the moon through the curtain from the inner quarters, she sees Zhaoyang Palace deep in the distance through the hazy, dim spaces between trees. Zhaoyang Palace is where Zhao Feiyan receives the emperor's favor night after night, where the emperor enjoys his pleasures. To such a place she can no longer go, nor can she receive favor by his side. Even the moon does not appear clearly. Details can be found in historical records.

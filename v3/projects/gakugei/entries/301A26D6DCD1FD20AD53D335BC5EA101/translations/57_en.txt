Seeing Off Court Assessor Wei - Wang Wei

Desiring to pursue the general and capture Youxian,
Horses gallop across the battlefield toward Juyan.
From afar I know the Han envoy beyond Xiaoguan Pass
Will grieve to see the lonely fortress at sunset's edge.

Now you are following in the footsteps of the frontier general, thinking to capture the barbarian chieftain Youxian as prisoner, and march forward spiritedly toward Juyan. Though you depart with high spirits, not knowing what lies ahead, when you reach the area around Xiaoguan Pass and see the lonely fortress at evening time, you will likely feel melancholy remembering your hometown, and will grieve with sorrow. It will certainly not be the same as your initial brave enthusiasm. For details, see "Zhangu."

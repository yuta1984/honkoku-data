Seeing Off Judge Li on His Mission to Jinjiang at the Rear Pavilion of Guozhou - Receiving the Character "Autumn"　by Cen Can

The post road of Xiyuan hangs over the city walls
Guests disperse at the Red Pavilion, rain has not yet ceased
When you depart, try to observe:
The white clouds above the Fen River still resemble autumn in Han times

【Modern Translation and Commentary】
At the rear pavilion of Guozhou (a building behind the castle), I saw off Judge Li as he departed on a mission to Jinjiang. This poem was composed using the character "autumn" from the poetry rhyme scheme.

The post road of Xiyuan runs above the castle walls. The guests have all dispersed at the Red Pavilion, and the rain has not yet stopped. My friend, when you depart, try to observe: the white clouds above the Fen River remain unchanged from autumn in the Han dynasty.

The "rear pavilion" refers to a building behind the castle of Guozhou. Since the highway crosses over mountains above Xiyuan castle, it is described as "hanging over." The guests who came to see you off at the river pavilion have all returned home, leaving a sense of loneliness. Moreover, with the rain not stopping, traveling in such a lonely season must be particularly melancholy.

Along your route, around the Fen River, there are ancient sites from Han Emperor Wu's time. When you go, try to observe them. The people from Han times have long since vanished without a trace. Only the white clouds remain unchanged from Han times. There will be no more floating of tower ships as in ancient times. If you observe such scenes, you will surely feel moved by the past and become even more melancholy.

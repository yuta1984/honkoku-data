"Composed on New Year's Eve" by Chang Jian

In the cold lamplight of a traveler's inn, alone and sleepless
What is it that makes this traveler's heart grow ever more desolate?
Tonight I think of my hometown a thousand li away
Frost-whitened temples, tomorrow morning another year passes

Tonight being New Year's Eve, back in my hometown they would be lighting many lamps throughout the night in joyful celebration, but being a traveler, my lamp burns dimly, so various thoughts arise and I cannot sleep. This too must be the fate of a traveler's life. What is this "traveler's heart" that makes me feel so suddenly desolate and melancholy? Even I myself cannot understand it. Tonight being New Year's Eve, everyone else celebrates merrily, but I am in such a place thinking of my hometown a thousand li away and grieving. When tonight ends, I will have aged another year come morning, my hair growing ever whiter, and not knowing when I might return home, I feel all the more desolate and melancholy.

Following the Illustrated Tang Poetry Selection
Continuing my grandfather's aspiration, last year the illustrations for five-character quatrains were completed, and this year I am thinking of continuing with seven-character quatrains. When I happened to visit Master Fuyo, he had illustrations of seven-character quatrain scenes to give to young students. I borrowed these and asked the master for permission, but it was not granted.

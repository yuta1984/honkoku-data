Seeing Off Shen Zifu to Jiangnan

At the willow ferry crossing, travelers are few. The fisherman rows his oar toward the riverbank.
Only the longing that resembles spring scenery remains. From north to south of the river, I see you off and return.

At the willow ferry crossing, travelers are rare. The fisherman rows toward the riverbank.
Only my longing thoughts that resemble the spring landscape remain.
Between north and south of the river, I see you off and return home.
Seeing off Shen Zifu as he goes to Jiangnan.　　　　　　　　Wang Wei

He travels from north of the river toward the south. There may be a main highway, but the ferry crossing where we now see him off is not on the main road, so there is little coming and going of travelers. The fisherman is a person who fishes. "Linqi" refers to the area near the riverbank. The fisherman rows his boat to ferry people across the flowing water. Out of reluctance to part, one continues to watch the departing figure. Now, Jiangnan is in the midst of spring, and there is no place without spring scenery. My feelings of longing cannot be expressed adequately in words. Seeing spring scenery everywhere, please understand my boundless feelings. My heart goes ahead while my body remains here, so it is said "seeing you off and returning."

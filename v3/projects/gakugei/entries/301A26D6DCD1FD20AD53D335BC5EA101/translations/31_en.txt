Remembering the Past in Yue

King Goujian of Yue defeated Wu
Returning loyal retainers all went home in brocade robes
Palace ladies like flowers filled the spring palace
Now only partridges fly here

When the King of Yue became powerful and destroyed the King of Wu, his meritorious retainers achieved great deeds and received rewards. After that, the King of Yue also reached the extreme of arrogance, and had very many palace ladies - beauties like flowers filled the spring palace in magnificent splendor. But now it has become a wasteland where only partridges fly. This is said because there are very many birds called partridges in the country of Yue. This illustration depicts the appearance of the ancient palace of the King of Yue.

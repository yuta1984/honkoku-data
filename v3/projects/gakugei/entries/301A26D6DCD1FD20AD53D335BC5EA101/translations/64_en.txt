Rouge-powdered women attend the wine shop, weak willows droop down, golden flower winter wine dissolves the fine liquor.
Music and song at evening can well detain guests, intoxicating to death the frivolous youth of Chang'an.

[Illustration] Part Two

Beautiful women with rouge powder attend the wine shop's furnace, with willows and such growing luxuriantly and drooping down. Golden flowers floating on top of winter-brewed wine - "golden flower" refers to good wine, and it can be interpreted as famous wine like "dobi" (fine liquor) that one drinks, or as something dissolved in wine for drinking. When courtesans perform music, song, and dance and evening comes, they draw in crowds for drinking parties. Therefore, frivolous young men in high spirits carouse drunkenly at this place, but I find no pleasure in it and do not enjoy myself.

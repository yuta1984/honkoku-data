Bronze Sparrow Platform

The palace halls of the Bronze Platform are committed to ash and dust
The garden tomb of the Wei lord lies by the banks of Zhang River
Even now, gazing westward, one can still bear the thoughts
How much more so for the singing and dancing performers of that time

The Bronze Sparrow Platform burned down in warfare, so it became ash and dust with no trace remaining, completely flattened. "To commit" means to be buried and lost. Looking at the area around the Wei lord's garden tomb, it stands by the Zhang River banks, but how lonely it is.

Now, looking westward, thinking that even the traces of those called heroes have vanished, one can barely bear to look. Even now it's hard to bear seeing this. How much more so when the singing and dancing palace ladies of old gazed out from atop this platform - how sorrowful it must have been for them.

Seeing Off a Person Returning to the Capital

【Commentary】
I go westward, but since he returns eastward from the high western regions, it is said he "returns from beyond heaven." Since he is returning to the capital, he spurs his horse forward, hurrying back as swift as a bird - how enviable! You must be happy to be returning home, but I cannot return. Here I am in the north of Jiaohe, and now as I see you off from this place, it is already the cold season with snow falling. While watching this snow, I compose this poem. In sending you off, I reflect that while I have come to such a cold place and you are returning home, when will I ever return? When will we meet again? Thinking of this makes me sad, and tears soak my robes.

【Poem】
A single horse returns from beyond heaven in the west
Raising the whip, competing only with birds in flight
Seeing you off in the ninth month, north of Jiaohe
Writing poetry in the snow, tears fill my robes

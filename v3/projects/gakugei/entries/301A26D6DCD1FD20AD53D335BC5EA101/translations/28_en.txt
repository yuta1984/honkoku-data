Autumn, Going Down the Jing Gate

Frost falls, the river trees at Jing Gate are bare
White sail without trouble hangs in the autumn wind
This journey is not for sea bass sashimi
Naturally loving famous mountains, I enter Shan-zhong

The mountain forests of Jing Gate have withered from frost due to autumn, and the leaves have fallen, becoming sparse, hence "river trees are bare." Just as Gu Kaizhi of the Jin dynasty once passed through with a pleasant heart toward Wu-zhong, I too sail safely without trouble, hoisting my sail in the autumn wind. Taking advantage of the blowing autumn wind, I travel not like Zhang Han who remembered sea bass sashimi and resigned from office to return home. Since Wu-zhong is not originally my hometown, it's not for that reason, but because Wu-zhong is a place with many mountains, I go there to see them.

Song of Liangzhou　Wang Han

Fine grape wine in a luminous cup
About to drink when the pipa urges from horseback
Even if I fall drunk upon the battlefield
Do not laugh, my lord
Since ancient times, how many who went to war have returned?

Drinking wine made from grapes in a luminous cup. For accompaniment, I'll play the pipa and other instruments on horseback, stirring up the drinking mood. People will surely laugh at me lying here drunk like this, but I don't care. Since ancient times, few who have come to this place to fight have returned home. Most have died in battle or from illness. Since I too know not whether I'll live to see tomorrow, it's better to drink wine and enjoy myself.

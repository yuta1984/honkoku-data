"At the Study Hall, Having Already Drunk in the Evening, Again Inviting Minister Li to Dismount and Compose Poetry Under the Moon" by Du Fu

The lake moon and forest wind are both clear together
Dismounting from horses with remaining wine, we again pour together  
Long having abandoned worldly concerns like wild cranes with white temples
Never mind that the neighbor's cock crows at the fifth watch

The moon over the lake at the study hall is clear, and the wind's mood is good. Coming to this lakeside, staying until the approaching evening when it's time to return, I invite Minister Li, and we dismount from our horses to share the remaining wine, gathering close to pour it out.

Though people may say it's unseemly for someone like me to drink so much, I don't care. Like wild cranes, my hair has turned white, so whatever they say, so be it. I've become indifferent to worldly concerns. "Never mind" - so be it. Even if the neighbor's rooster crows and the fifth watch of dawn approaches, we must drink through the night. This expresses his spirited determination.

"Long having abandoned" doesn't simply mean discarding, but rather means not caring about worldly matters.

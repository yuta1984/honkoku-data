"The Ninth Day in Shu" (The Ninth Day in Sichuan Province) by Wang Bo

On the ninth day of the ninth month at Longing-for-Home Pavilion, at another's table in a foreign land, I raise a farewell cup for a departing guest. Human feelings already weary of the hardships of the south - why do wild geese come from the northern lands?

According to the custom of climbing to high places on the Double Ninth Festival, I too was invited by others to climb the Longing-for-Home Pavilion in Shu. Looking out, it would be delightful if this were my hometown, but this is in a foreign land. Especially today, as there are people climbing to this place and then parting, it is all the more sorrowful. I have come from the capital to the southern country of Shu and cannot return to my hometown, yet why do the wild geese fly here from the northern lands? This sentiment is expressed through the metaphor of birds. The emotional tone is rich and profound. For more details, see the classical references.

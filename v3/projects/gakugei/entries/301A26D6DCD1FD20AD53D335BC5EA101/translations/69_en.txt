Two Victory Songs for Lord Feng's Defeat of Fanxian　　by Cen Can

The Han general, receiving imperial favor, defeats the barbarians in the west
The victory dispatch is first presented to Weiyang Palace
The emperor has already opened the Qilin Pavilion in anticipation
Who now can count achievements rivaling General Ershi?

【Commentary from the interlinear notes】
Fanxian refers to barbarian tribes of the Western Regions. Victory songs celebrate triumphant returns after achieving military merit.

The commanding general was appointed by imperial decree and has completely destroyed the enemy as expected, without any difficulties. A victory dispatch is an urgent report announcing the defeat of barbarians. This report of successful conquest is presented to the emperor before all the troops have returned. When such victory reports arrive, the emperor reviews them in Weiyang Palace.

When anyone returns to the capital, the emperor will surely bestow rewards. The emperor has already opened the Qilin Pavilion and waits there even before the general's return. This current achievement is so outstanding that even the great accomplishments of General Ershi (Li) Guangli, though vast, pale in comparison to this superior feat of arms.

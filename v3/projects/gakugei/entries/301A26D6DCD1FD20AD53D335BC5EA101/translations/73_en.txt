"Meeting an Envoy Entering the Capital" by Cen Shen

Looking east toward my old garden, the road stretches endlessly
My sleeves aged and worn, tears never dry
Meeting on horseback with no paper or brush
I rely on you to carry word and report my safety

【Modern Translation and Commentary】
Looking east toward my hometown, the road stretches endlessly far. My sleeves are worn with age and my tears never dry. Meeting an envoy on horseback but having no writing materials, I ask you to carry my message and report that I am safe.

Since I have come to this frontier region, the road to my hometown is very long and distant. Meeting an envoy bound for the capital, I am overwhelmed with emotion, my sleeves wet with tears that have no time to dry. Aged and weary, I struggle to continue. I envy the envoy and would like to entrust him with a letter to my hometown, but being on horseback, I have no paper or brush. So I simply ask you to convey this message - that I am doing quite well and am in good health.

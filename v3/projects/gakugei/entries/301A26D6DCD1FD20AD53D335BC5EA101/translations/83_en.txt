Seeing Off Judge Liu as He Departs for Qixi　by Cen Can

In the fifth month at Fire Mountain travelers are few, I watch your horse depart swift as a bird.
The capital envoy's camp is west of Taibai, when the horn sounds once, dawn breaks over barbarian skies.

Looking at Fire Mountain in the western regions around the tenth day of the fifth month, it is a lonely place where not a single traveler passes. Now you do not know the conditions over there, so you ride your horse cheerfully and alone at full speed, but the military camp you are going to is west of Mount Taibai, close to the barbarian lands. When horns are blown at dawn in that barbarian sky from who knows where, it will be sorrowful. Riding your horse at full gallop for the first time [to such a place] will not be easy.

Gao Shi - Song of the Nine Bends

Iron horses gallop across the iron mountain peaks
Looking west at Luosa to gain a feudal title
At Qinghai now about to water the horses
At the Yellow River no need to guard against autumn

I too thought to establish some merit, riding iron-strong horses and galloping here and there around the Iron Ridge area, targeting the kingdom of Luosa to the west. If there were any arrogant enemies who came to attack, I would defeat them, take their country, and become a great lord. However, even when I go to the Qinghai area to water my horses, the barbarian peoples don't interfere in this peaceful reign. Since at the Yellow River area we guard against autumn and the barbarians don't enter China, there is nothing to do. Therefore, it's regrettable that I cannot establish any merit.

"Guarding against autumn" refers to the season when barbarian tribes would invade China, so checkpoints were established to defend against them.

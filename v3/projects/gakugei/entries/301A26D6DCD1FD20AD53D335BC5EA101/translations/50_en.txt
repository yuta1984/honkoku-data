Sending Off Minister Xue to Anlu - Wang Changling

Clouds and rain at the ferry darken Mount Xiang,
The exiled guest's parting sorrow shows in his face in Chu land.
From afar I send off the lone boat to Anlu Prefecture,
Where at heaven's edge lies Muling Pass.

Now as I send off this person (Minister Xue), I see that it happens to be a time of wind and rain, so Mount Xiang and others are obscured by clouds and rain and cannot be seen. "The face in Chu land" - in the Chu Ci (Songs of Chu), this refers to being touched by sorrow, but here it speaks of the sorrow of parting. Since I myself am in exile, living in this land of Chu with a haggard countenance, the sending away of another adds to my own deep sadness. Sending off one who boards a boat bound for Anlu - with such overwhelming reluctance, I gaze at the departing figure. The rain falls darkly, and though Muling Pass beyond Anlu Prefecture, being at a high place, should tower toward heaven from this spot, today it cannot be seen through rain and clouds, making the parting especially poignant.

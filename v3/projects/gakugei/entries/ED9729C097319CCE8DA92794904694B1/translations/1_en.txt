Koishikawa is the general name for the area from Suidōbashi to the vicinity of Hakusan. In ancient times, it was called this because many small streams with abundant pebbles flowed there. 《The "Edo Meishō-shi" mentions it as a famous place called "Azuma River," but this appears to lack foundation》 It is also said that this name comes from the shrine of Hakusan from Ishikawa District in Kaga Province being enshrined here, but the details are unclear. 《The Hakusan Gongen of Koishikawa was established through solicitation in the first year of Genna (1615)》 In the second year of Eiroku (1559), the land register of the Hōjō family of Odawara records that Sakurai added the place name "Koishikawa Honjo" to his domain, and a person named Shimazu Magoshirō also held land at Hōrin-in Shōgetsu-bun in this area. 《According to Kikuoka Senryō, northwest of Sugamo at Negi》

《The waterway flowing under Mata Bridge, from south of Koishikawa Palace through behind Dentsū-in and Yanagi-chō, passing through the Mito domain estate and joining the Kanda River above Suidō Bridge, is said to be the old site of Koishikawa》

From "Kaikoku Zakki" - At a place called Koishikawa:

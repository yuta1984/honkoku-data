She is the daughter of Prince Momozono Shikibu-kyō, the younger brother of Emperor Kiritsubo, making her Genji's cousin. She becomes the Kamo Vestal Virgin in the "Sakaki" chapter and takes religious vows in the "Usugumo" chapter. She was someone who remained strong-hearted toward Genji and never yielded to him. This poem is her reply to Genji's poem: "The dew I saw that day cannot be forgotten—has the prime of the morning glory flowers passed away?" The meaning is that as autumn passes, the morning glories entangled in the hedge have faded and withered to the point of being barely visible, which she compares to herself. "Mist" is both an associated word with hedges and used rhetorically to express "being there or not being there."

Asagao Vestal Virgin
Autumn having ended,
in the misty hedge
entangled and clinging,
the morning glories fade
to barely visible.

She is the daughter of a Middle Counselor and the principal wife of the Governor of Iyo. She was someone who remained cold toward Genji. In the "Sekiya" chapter, after being widowed, she became a nun, and later Genji had her live at Rokujō-in. This poem was composed when Genji, lamenting that she had escaped by leaving only her robe behind on a night when he was secretly visiting her, sent her the poem: "Having left only her cicada shell at the base of this tree, how dear her character still remains." The meaning is that like the dew on a cicada's wings in thick treetops, hidden by the leaves and invisible from outside yet secretly moistening them, she too secretly wets her sleeves with tears. "Utsusemi" simply means cicada. In ancient times, one's actual living body was called "utsusemi," but from the medieval period onward it became the name for cicadas.

Utsusemi the Nun
Like dew upon
the cicada's wings,
hidden in the leaves,
secretly, secretly
my sleeves grow wet.

His father is Genji, his mother is Aoi-no-ue. Born in the Aoi chapter, he came of age in the Otome chapter, was appointed as a monjōsei (student of Chinese literature) and became a jijū (chamberlain) to begin with, then gradually rose through the ranks to become Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) in the Niou-no-miya chapter. This poem was composed early on a cloudy winter morning during the period when he was separated from Kumoi-no-kari. The meaning of the poem is that frost and ice bind together harshly, and my tears fall like rain, darkening the dawn sky, expressing his feelings through the seasonal atmosphere. "Utate" can also be said as "utata," the same as the common expression "utateshi." "Akegure" refers to the still-dark time of daybreak.

Her father is the retired minister (chiji-no-otodo), her mother is the person who later became the consort of the Azech Dainagon (Great Counselor Inspector). From the beginning she exchanged hearts with Yūgiri, and in the Fuji-no-uraba chapter was finally permitted to become his consort, bearing him many children. This poem was composed as a response during the period when they were separated and meeting in secret. The wet nurse discovered them and shamed Yūgiri for his low rank and light blue court robe, calling it "the fate of a sixth-rank courtier." At that time Yūgiri had composed: "Should the deep crimson color of my tear-stained sleeves be disparaged as mere light green?" The meaning of the poem is: through various circumstances, the extent of my life's sorrows becomes known—what karmic relationship has caused this? Taking up his words about "crimson" and "green," she says "iro-iro" (various colors) and also mentions "koromo" (garments). "Naka-no-koromo" refers to the garments that separate men and women when they meet. Here it is not used in that sense, but merely as a play on words.

the extent of my life's sorrows
becomes known—
how was this middle garment
dyed with such fate?

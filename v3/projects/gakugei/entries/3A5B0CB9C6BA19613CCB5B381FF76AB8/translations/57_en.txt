She was Yūgiri's wet nurse and the person who initially arranged the relationship between him and Kumoi no Kari. This poem was composed to be heard by the Minister when he later permitted them to become husband and wife, after having initially separated them, and she had not forgotten the initial hardship. The meaning is that she regards both Yūgiri and of course Kumoi no Kari as trustworthy masters, because their future together was built on feelings they had exchanged since childhood—this sentiment is expressed through the metaphor of pine trees. Both "futaba" (first leaves) and "kage" (shade) are related metaphors.

Saishō no Menoto
Both of them
I trust as my shade—
from their first leaves,
these pines whose roots
have intertwined, through all their years to come.

She was the daughter of Sanjō's Nyosan no Miya's wet nurse, and thus served this princess. She was the person Kashiwagi asked to act as intermediary. This poem is her response to one that Kashiwagi sent when he first fell in love with Nyosan no Miya: "Yoso ni mite oranu nageki wa shikeredo nagori koishiki hana no yūkage" (Though I suffer from gazing from afar without plucking, how lovely is the lingering evening shadow of this flower). The meaning is: since she is already promised to Genji, do not now reveal in your expression that you have set your heart on the unattainable Nyosan no Miya, lest people should know of it. She compares the princess to a cherry blossom.

Ko-jijū
Do not now reveal
your feelings in your expression—
mountain cherry,
knowing you have set your heart
on an unreachable branch.

His father is Yūgiri and his mother is Tō no Naishi. This poem was also composed at the same maple viewing banquet mentioned above. This person came later as a messenger from Akashi no Chūgū and composed this poem. The heart of the poem is: while I find it painful to pass by this mountain village because of the beauty of the maple shadows, where has autumn gone, abandoning this scene?

From where
has autumn departed?
The shadows of maples
in this mountain village
are too precious
to leave behind

Her father is the Retired Minister and her mother is the woman who later became the consort of the Asechi no Dainagon. From the beginning she had exchanged hearts with Yūgiri, and in the Fujinouraba (Wisteria Leaves) chapter she was finally permitted to become his consort and bore him children. This poem is her reply from the time when they were kept apart. When they secretly met, her wet nurse discovered them and shamed Yūgiri for his low rank and light green court robe, calling him a lowly sixth-rank courtier. At that time Yūgiri composed: "Should one call the deep color of sleeves wet with crimson tears light green?" This is her reply. The heart of the poem is: through all these various circumstances, the pain of my situation becomes known—what kind of karma is this? She picks up on his words "crimson" and "green" to say "various colors," and also uses "garment." "Naka no koromo" (middle garment) refers to the clothing that separates men and women when they meet, but here it is not used in that sense, but merely as a verbal association.

how was it dyed,
this middle

This is a court lady serving Rokujō Lady of the Bedchamber. This poem is her reply when Genji was visiting the Lady's residence and, at their morning parting, as this court lady was seeing him off, Genji detained her and composed: "Though I hide the reputation of moving from flower to flower, here is this morning's morning glory that I pass by without plucking." The meaning is: without waiting for the mist to clear, you return late at night to the Lady's quarters, appearing to set your heart on other beautiful places where lovely women dwell. She deliberately pretends not to recognize this as referring to herself and frames it as being about the Lady.

Court Lady Chūjō
Without waiting for
the morning mist
to clear,
I see you do not linger
with your heart on flowers.

She is the sister of the Bishop of Kitayama, the wife of the Middle Counselor Azechi, and the maternal grandmother of Lady Murasaki. This poem was composed when Lady Murasaki, having lost her mother at a young age, was being raised by her alone, and she herself became gravely ill. The meaning is: it is heartbreaking and against my will that I should die first, leaving behind someone whose future dwelling place after growing up I do not know. She expresses this through the metaphor of dew on young grass. "Okurasu" means "okurakasu" (to leave behind). "Sora" is used in such contexts and corresponds to "kokoro" (heart/mind). In common usage, we also say "miru sora," "kiku sora," "sora," and so forth.

The Nun of Kitayama
The dew that leaves behind
young grass, not knowing
where it will grow
and flourish,
has no heart for vanishing.

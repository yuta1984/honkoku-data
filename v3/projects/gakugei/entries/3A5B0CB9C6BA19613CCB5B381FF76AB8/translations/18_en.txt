This is the wife of the Asechi Dainagon (Inspector-Controller-Major Counselor) and the mother of Lady Kiritsubo. This poem is a reply to the above-mentioned poem by Yugehi no Myōbu. The meaning is that in her dwelling overgrown with cogon grass where she already lives in sorrow, the visit of Myōbu as the emperor's messenger has added even more tears - this sentiment is expressed through metaphor of insects. Those permitted to ascend to the palace, regardless of gender, are called "cloud-dwellers" (kumo no uebito). "Asajiu" refers to places where cogon grass flowers (commonly called tsubana) grow.

　Mother of the Lady
Even more so
where insect voices
are thick in the cogon grass,
dew gathers with
the cloud-dweller's arrival

Initially a minister, he was the person who performed the capping ceremony for Prince Genji's coming of age. The one who performs the capping is called "hikiire." He is the father of Lady Aoi and Genji's father-in-law. He becomes Daijō-daijin (Chancellor) in the "Miotsukushi" chapter and dies in the "Usugumo" chapter. This poem is a reply to Emperor Kiritsubo's poem "Though young, with this first topknot, through long years..." composed during Genji's coming-of-age ceremony. The meaning is: according to your words, with the deep pledge I have bound up, if Prince Genji's heart remains unchanged, it will last through long ages. Since it is the occasion of coming-of-age, everything is composed around that theme. The use of purple braided cord is as mentioned above. "Asezu" and "asezu" have the same meaning.

Hikiire no Daijō-daijin
If bound with
a heart so deep
in this topknot,
the deep purple's
color will not fade

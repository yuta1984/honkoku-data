She is the daughter of the Lay Priest Prince, and her mother is a court lady called Chūjō no Kimi. In the Azumaya (Eastern Cottage) chapter she becomes Kaoru's beloved and lives in Uji. In the Ukifune (The Floating Bridge) chapter she has a secret affair with Prince Niou, and in the Kagerō (Mayfly) chapter she throws herself into the river. She is rescued and cared for by the nun who is the sister of the Abbot of Yokawa, and in the Tenarai (At Writing Practice) chapter she becomes a nun herself. This poem is her reply to one sent from Kaoru: "The long bond of Uji Bridge will not decay—do not let your heart be troubled by anxious thoughts." The meaning of the poem is: since your visits have become infrequent, I feel anxious, but should I still trust in this bond that will not decay?

Princess Ukifune
Should I trust—
that this thing will not decay,
this Uji Bridge—
in this uncertain world
of constant interruptions?

His father is Yūgiri and his mother is Kumoi no Kari. This poem was composed when he accompanied Prince Niou to a maple viewing banquet at Mt. Uji on the first day of the tenth month. The heart of the poem is: when he came for cherry blossom viewing in spring the previous year, accompanying the same prince, the Lay Priest Prince was still alive, but now he has passed away and the princesses must be so lonely. This sentiment is expressed through the contrast between the flowering spring and the loneliness of late autumn. "Konamoto" (base of the tree) contains a pun with "ko no moto" (where the children are), and "sae ya" is addressed to the treetops in general.

At some time past
when I glimpsed
the height of blossoms—
even this tree's base
seems lonely in autumn

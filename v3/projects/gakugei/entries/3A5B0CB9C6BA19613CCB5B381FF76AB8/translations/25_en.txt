She is the daughter of the Governor of Iyo and Utsusemi's stepdaughter. Later she becomes the principal wife of Kurando no Shōshō (Lesser Captain of the Inner Palace Guards). This poem is her reply to Genji's poem sent after they spent one night together: "If I had not even faintly tied the pampas grass at the eaves, what would I have blamed the dew's complaint upon?" The meaning is that through such suggestive letters from him, what she had been lamenting as merely one night of his affection has also become, from her side of unrequited love, something that draws her heart and binds her feelings—this she compares to the bent pampas grass swaying in the wind, half frozen with frost.

Lady of the Eaves Pampas Grass
Hinting at feelings
carried on the wind,
the lower pampas grass
is half-bound
with frost.

She is the daughter of Sanmi no Chūjō (Third Rank Middle Captain). She had relations with the Retired Minister and gave birth to Tamakazura. Later she was loved by Genji and died in the "Yūgao" chapter. This poem is her reply to Genji's poem composed at dawn on the night when they rode together in the same carriage to a certain mansion: "Did people in the past also lose their way like this? I still do not know this path of dawn." The meaning is that what hides the moon is the mountain's edge. The moon that travels without knowing the heart of that mountain's edge is in the middle sky, and it is difficult to predict when its reflection might disappear. She compares Genji to the mountain's edge and herself to the moon, expressing her anxiety about the uncertain future of being led away like this.

Lady Yūgao
Not knowing the heart
of the mountain's edge,
the traveling moon
in the empty sky above—
will its reflection fade away?

She was a daughter of the Retired Minister by a different mother. This poem was composed and sent to Yūgiri during the time when she was lamenting that her elder sister Kumoi no Kari and Yūgiri had been separated. The meaning of the poem is: If the one you love is drifting without refuge on the waves, then let my body take that place and yield to you, my lord. Please make up your mind and give me an answer. She expresses this sentiment by likening it to a boat rowing on the open sea.

Ōmi no Kimi
If an offing boat
drifts on the pathless waves
with no refuge,
tell me of a harbor
where I might guide my pole.

She was a court lady serving the Kokiden Consort. This poem was composed in place of the Consort as a reply to a letter that Ōmi no Kimi had sent to her elder sister, the Kokiden Consort, containing the poem: "Young grass of Ōmi's sea at Ikaga Point—how shall we meet at Tago Bay's waves?" The meaning is "Please come out to meet me, I am waiting," incorporating the four provinces of Hitachi, Suruga, Settsu, and Chikuzen, strung together nonsensically. This was composed as a playful response matching the meaningless nature of Ōmi no Kimi's poem.

Chūnagon no Kimi
At Hitachi's
Suruga sea,
at Suma bay,
let the waves rise up—
the pines of Hakozaki.

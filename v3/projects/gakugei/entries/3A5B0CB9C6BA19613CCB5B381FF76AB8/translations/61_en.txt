This is the Buddhist priest who conducted the Butsumy-e ceremony held at Rokujō-in at the end of the year when Murasaki-no-ue passed away. This poem is a response to Genji's verse, composed when he was so overwhelmed with grief that he was preparing to become a monk, and on this occasion he summoned the priest before him to offer sake, reciting: "Not knowing if I'll live until spring, I shall wear the plum blossoms that bloom amid the snow today." The meaning is that since the Butsumy-e ceremony prays for national prosperity, peace for the people, and longevity, he prays for Genji's well-being so that he may view those plum blossoms for a thousand generations, while saying that he himself has grown old, playing on the word "furu" (to fall/to age) with the falling snow.

The Butsumy-e Priest
Praying that you'll see
the blossoms of
a thousand springs,
my own body falls
with the snow

This is a court lady serving Tamakazura. This poem is a response to a verse by Kurōdo-no-shōshō, who was courting Tamakazura's daughters during a time when Kaoru also visited and there were banquets. Suspecting that she might have been swayed by such attention, the Shōshō composed: "Everyone seems to turn their hearts to flowers, while I alone am bewildered in the darkness of a spring night." The meaning of her response is that it is precisely because one devotes sincere feelings and loyalty that one should be regarded with affection from this side as well. One should not be swayed merely by casual courtesies. She expresses this by saying that even plum blossoms reveal their beauty only when picked—one cannot be moved by fragrance alone. The poem encompasses all these meanings.

Plum Blossom Court Lady
Is it by plucking
that one truly knows
the plum blossom's beauty?
I shall not be moved
by fragrance alone

Her parents are the same as her elder sister Omoto. Her childhood name was Ate-kimi. She also went down to Tsukushi together with Tamakazura, and accompanied her when returning to the capital. This poem was also composed at the same time as her elder sister's. The meaning is as follows: Not knowing either the past or the future, rowing out into the vast open sea in all directions, with my own fate uncertain, I wonder where I will settle down to become one who loves you. "Ahare" is a combination of the lament word "ah" and the lament word "hare," similar to the common practice of drawing out a long breath saying "ah" - it is a word of lamentation.

Neither my past
nor my future
do I know—
rowing out to sea,
ah, where shall I
long for you?

A person from Higo Province, serving as Dazai-no-taigen (Senior Inspector of Dazaifu). This poem was composed with rustic feelings, loving Tamakazura without knowing that he was despised and rejected. The meaning is: If by any chance my heart should change toward you, I would make a vow invoking the mirror deity of Matsura District in Hizen Province. The mirror deity is the deified sacred mirror of Empress Jingū.

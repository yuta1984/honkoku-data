She is a court lady who served Yūgao. After Yūgao's death, she served Genji's household. This poem was composed when she made a pilgrimage to Hatsuse to learn of Tamakazura's whereabouts and there encountered Tamakazura directly. The meaning is: If I had not prayed and searched at this Hatsuse temple, would I have been able to meet you again after all these years? ○ This refers to the poem about "two cedars by the Furukawa fields of Hatsuse River, meeting again after years at the two cedars." "Tachido" means the place where they stand.

Had I not sought
the place where two cedars stand,
would I have seen you, my lady,
in the fields
of Furukawa?

She is Genji's daughter, and her mother is Akashi-no-ue. Born in the "Miotsukushi" chapter, she became the adopted child of Murasaki-no-ue in the "Usugumo" chapter, became the Crown Prince's consort in the "Fuji no Uraba" chapter and gave birth to a prince, and became Empress in the "Minori" chapter. This poem is a reply to one sent by Akashi-no-ue on New Year's Day of the Rat: "To one who has spent years drawn away like pine boughs, let the warbler's first song of today be heard." The meaning is: Though I was separated early and raised by others, and years have passed, should I forget my true mother in my heart? I will not forget - this sentiment is expressed through the warbler metaphor.

Though separated
and years have passed,
can the warbler
forget the roots of the pine
from which it fledged?

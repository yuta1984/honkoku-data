This person also attended the same moon-viewing banquet and composed this poem. This person was an elderly man who had served Emperor Kiritsubo intimately, and therefore yearned for those bygone days. The meaning of the poem is that the emperor abandoned his noble throne and wonders in what place he might have hidden himself, comparing Emperor Kiritsubo to the moon. "Sumika" means dwelling place, asking about location. "Yowa" is the same as "yoi" - "wa" and "i" are interchangeable. It is incorrect to interpret this as meaning the characters for "dwelling" or "midnight."

Udaiben (Senior Secretary of the Right)
Abandoning your dwelling
above the clouds,
O moon of midnight—
in which valley
did you hide your light?

Her father was Sangi Kunaiky (Counselor and Palace Minister), her mother was Senji (Imperial messenger). When Akashi-no-ue gave birth, Genji went down to that bay. In the Matsukaze chapter, he brought the young princess up to the capital. This poem was composed as a response when Akashi-no-ue, regretting the separation as the princess was to be transferred to Murasaki-no-ue's quarters, had written: "Though the path through the deep snowy mountains may not clear, still keep treading it, never letting the tracks cease." The meaning is that even if she were to seclude herself in Mount Yoshino where snow falls without pause, I would certainly come seeking her, and how could the tracks of a communicating heart ever cease? They are not something that would break off. The meaning is "all the more so for this mountain village."

Akashi-no-menoto (Akashi's Wet Nurse)
Even seeking you
in Mount Yoshino
where there are no breaks in snow,
could the tracks of
a communicating heart ever cease?

He is a prince of Emperor Kiritsubo and the younger brother of Genji. Since he fled from the world to live in the village of Uji, he is also called the Uji Prince. Because he entered the Buddhist path without shaving his head, he is also called the Lay Priest Prince. An upāsaka (lay priest) refers to someone who becomes a Buddhist disciple while maintaining a secular appearance. This poem was composed when he lamented the death of his principal wife after having two children. The poem speaks of "leaving temporary children in this temporary world." "Kari" refers to wild ducks, a type of waterfowl. Not only mandarin ducks but all waterfowl are creatures where male and female are affectionate with each other, so they are often used as metaphors for relationships between men and women. The heart of the poem is: my wife has abandoned me and died, leaving me alone among our young children in this fleeting world. The ducklings represent his daughters.

The Lay Priest Prince
Abandoning me,
my mate has departed—
like waterfowl in
this temporary world,
I am left behind

She is the daughter of the Lay Priest Prince, and her mother is the daughter of the Right Minister. She dies in the Agamaki (The Trefoil Knots) chapter. This poem is a response to Kaoru's poem of condolence when her father prince also died: "Even seeing the cogon grass that changes color, I think of sleeves darkened in mourning robes." The heart of the poem is: using my sleeves that have changed to mourning black as a dwelling for tears, I am utterly lost in grief with nowhere to turn. The expression "no place to rest" comes from referring to tears as dew. Sumizome is mourning dress, a blackish gray color.

Princess Agamaki
These sleeves that change color
become a dwelling for dew—
my very being has
nowhere at all
to rest

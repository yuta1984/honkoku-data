This is the woman who bit Sama no Kami's finger, and this is her reply to the previous poem. The meaning is: having counted in my heart alone all your various painful moments until now, is this finally the time we should part? "Koyaha" means "kore yaha" (is this?). "Separating from your hand" is like saying that one who follows you is separating. In general, those who follow are called "te" (hands). In military terms, they say "te no mono" (one's men) or "sakite" (vanguard), and colloquially "tesaki" (agent/subordinate).

　The Finger-Biting Woman
These painful moments
I have counted alone
in my heart—
is this the time
to part from your hand?

This is the person who rode in the same carriage as Sama no Kami to visit women on a moonlit night. This poem was composed when he played his flute to accompany a woman playing the koto. The meaning is: both the koto music is delightful and the moon is clear, both are extraordinary, and though this dwelling seems to await someone, could you detain a man whose heart is cold? No, you could not detain him. It is because I am one of deep devotion that I have come without missing this moment. "E naranu" resembles the colloquial expression "iwarenu" (indescribable). "Hikitomuru" (to detain) is a related word to "koto" (both meaning "thing" and referring to the musical instrument).

　The Courtier of Koto Music
Though both koto music
and moon are beyond compare
at this dwelling,
could she detain
a man so cold-hearted?

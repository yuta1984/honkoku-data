Her father is Tō no Chūjō (later the retired Chancellor), and her mother is the sister of Emperor Kiritsubo, who is the same-mother sister of the retired Chancellor. She became Genji's principal wife in the "Kiritsubo" chapter, gave birth to Yūgiri in the "Aoi" chapter, and died shortly after due to the vengeful spirit of Lady Rokujō. This poem was uttered spontaneously when she was suffering from spirit possession and Genji came to visit and comfort her; in reality, it was Lady Rokujō's heart that had entered her soul and made her speak. The meaning is: please bind and hold my soul that has become disturbed by anguished thoughts and has drifted out into the air, at the underlap of your robe's hem. This was composed based on the proverb that if you tie the hem of clothing when you see a person's soul floating away, it will remain. "Shitagahi" refers to the front part where the robe is folded over. "Kahi" means "ai" (joining/matching).

　Lady Aoi
Grieving and troubled,
my soul that wanders
disturbed in the air—
please bind it fast
at your robe's underlap.

She is the sister of Emperor Kiritsubo, the mother of Lady Aoi, and Genji's mother-in-law. After her husband the Chancellor died, she took religious vows and passed away in the "Fuji no Uraba" chapter. "Ōmiya" (Great Lady) refers to this person. This poem is her reply when Genji visited in the early spring the year after Lady Aoi's death and composed: "Wearing mourning robes changed today after many years, I feel as though tears are falling." The meaning is that she cannot even observe the New Year purification rituals, and the old woman always spends her days weeping in grief for her daughter.

　The Principal Wife of Chancellor and Great Minister
I do not call it
a new year—
what grows old
are the tears of one
who has grown old with grief.

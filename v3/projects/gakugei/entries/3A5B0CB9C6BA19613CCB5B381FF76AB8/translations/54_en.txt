She was a concubine of Lord Higekuro. This poem was composed when the lord transferred his affections to Tamakazura, causing his principal wife (kita no kata) to lose her composure and throw ashes from a brazier at him, burning his clothes and other items. The meaning of the poem is: The principal wife, being abandoned and left alone, could no longer bear the anguish of her heart burning with longing and jealousy. Her heart was consumed with envy toward her rival, leading to such an incident. She defends the principal wife while also concealing her own jealousy. There is a wordplay between "hitori" (alone) and "hitori" (brazier).

my heart burns with

Her father was Lord Higekuro, and her mother was the daughter of Prince Shikibu-kyō. She became the beloved of Prince Hotaru, and after the prince's death, became the principal wife of Lord Kōbai. This poem was left attached to a pillar when she departed her father's house following her mother. The meaning of the poem is: Though I must now leave this dwelling forever, O familiar maki pillar that I have known morning and evening, please do not forget me, even if people may forget. "Yado kare" (leaving the dwelling) is the same as saying "yo kare" (night passing). Maki refers to real wood, specifically cypress.

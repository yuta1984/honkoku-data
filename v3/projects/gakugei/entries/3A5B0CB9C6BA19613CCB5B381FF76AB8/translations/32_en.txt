Her father was a Deputy Minister of Military Affairs (Hyōbu-no-taifu), and her mother was a wet nurse of the Left Gate Guards. She was a court lady who served as an intermediary between Genji and Suetsumuhana. This poem was composed when Suetsumuhana sent New Year's court robes to Genji, but the colors were unsightly, and moreover, Genji laughed at her unsightly appearance. The meaning is: even if the pale-colored robes do not please you, it would be a joy if you would not utterly disparage them. The underlying meaning includes the hope that even if Suetsumuhana's appearance is poor, he might show compassion with his generous heart. "Hitohana-goromo" refers to cloth dyed once. "Kutasu" means to let decay.

Taifu-no-myōbu (Lady Taifu)
The crimson
single-dyed robe—
though it be pale,
if you do not make
a name for utterly ruining it

She was an Assistant Inner Palace Attendant (naishi-no-suke) during the reign of Emperor Kiritsubo, and wife of the Minister of Public Works. She later became a nun. Though aged, she remained young at heart and amorous. This poem was composed when Genji spoke to her in jest. The meaning is: if you would only come visit me, though I am old and past my prime, I would tenderly care for you. She expressed this by saying she would serve as a substitute for his well-trained horse, even though she is not young grass but old grass. This was composed based on the poems "When the undergrowth of the forest grows old, even horses show no interest" and "Would that I could serve as substitute—your well-trained horse does not come."

If you should come,
I would serve as substitute
for your well-trained horse—
even though I am
but withered lower leaves past their prime

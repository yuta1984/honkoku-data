She was the granddaughter of Prince Katsura-no-nakatsukasamiya and the wife (kitanokata) of Akashi-nyūdō (the Akashi Lay Monk). When she accompanied her daughter Akashi-no-ue to the capital, while the lay monk remained alone in Akashi, she composed this poem lamenting their parting. The meaning is: long ago when the lay monk became Governor of Harima, they left the capital together as a couple, but after many years have passed, this time she must travel alone in separation, so she might lose her way on country roads. The poem plays on the words "tabi" (time/occasion) and "tabi" (journey).

Though together we
left the capital,
on this occasion
shall I alone wander lost
on the path through the fields?

In various writings, people freely write about ancient emperors' affairs, whether favorably or unfavorably, without any restraint whatsoever. This is due to the adoption of Chinese customs and represents the height of grave error. In that country, kings never continue for long, and like the military generals of our imperial land, when dynasties change—when the Tang era comes, the Han era becomes that of strangers, so there is no need for restraint; when the Ming era comes, the Tang era becomes that of strangers, so there is no need for restraint.

After that, following this example, they successively created various poetry karuta sets—sometimes based on the Tales of Ise, sometimes on the Kokin Collection, and so forth. Thus there is also Genji karuta based on the Tale of Genji in the world

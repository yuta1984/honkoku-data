This is Emperor Kiritsubo's consort and Prince Genji's mother. She died in the "Kiritsubo" chapter. This poem was composed when her illness worsened and she was about to withdraw to her family home. The meaning of the poem is: now that this is the end of this world, as I bid farewell to the emperor and depart, what I wish could live on in the sadness of this parting path is my life. There is a wordplay between "ikimahoshi" (wanting to live) and "yukimahoshi" (wanting to go).

When the time comes
to part on this path
of sorrow,
what I long for
is life itself

This is a court lady of the imperial palace. This poem was composed when, after Lady Kiritsubo's death, she went as the emperor's messenger to the lady's family home and was about to return, hearing the voices of insects in the garden. The meaning is: like insects crying with all their voice until exhausted, I still find the long night insufficient and shed tears endlessly. "Suzumushi" (bell cricket) serves as a preface (jo-kotoba) to introduce "voice," and "falling tears" is associated with the bell cricket.

Even after
the bell cricket
exhausts its voice,
the long night brings
unceasing tears

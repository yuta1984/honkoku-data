This is a person who lived in Nakagawa in Kyōgoku. This poem is a reply to when Genji, after meeting this woman once, later passed by her house and sent in a poem: "I cannot help but return, cuckoo, to the hedge of the dwelling where we spoke briefly." The meaning is that while she surmises that the visitor is that lord, she expresses uncertainty, saying that since communication ceased and he has not come for so long, she cannot believe it now - this feeling is compared to the cuckoo's voice being inaudible, lost in the May rains.

The Woman of Nakagawa
Cuckoo,
though the voice that speaks
is indeed yours,
how uncertain it is
in this rainy May sky

This is the Fourth Princess, daughter of the previous emperor's consort. In the "Kiritsubo" chapter she becomes Imperial Consort to Emperor Kiritsubo, in the "Momiji no Ga" chapter she gives birth to Emperor Reizei, in the "Sakaki" chapter she takes the tonsure, and in the "Usugumo" chapter she dies. This poem is a reply to Genji's poem: "Would that I could be one who, even after seeing you, disappears into dreams where nights of meeting are rare." The meaning is that she deeply regrets and feels shame for her secret affair with Genji, and comparing her situation of having done something incomparably painful, she wonders whether, even if she were to die like a dream, her shameful reputation might still remain as gossip for generations.

Lady Usugumo
Will people perhaps
tell in their tales
of this incomparably
sorrowful life,
even if I make it
a dream from which I never wake?

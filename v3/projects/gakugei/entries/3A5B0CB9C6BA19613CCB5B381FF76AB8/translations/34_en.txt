She was the daughter of the former Crown Prince, and her mother was the Rokujō Lady (Miyasudokoro). In the "Aoi" chapter, she departed as the Ise Priestess, in the "Picture Contest" chapter became a consort of Emperor Reizei, in the "Maiden" chapter became Empress, and in the "Rites" chapter became Empress Dowager. This poem was her reply when she was departing for Ise as the shrine priestess, in response to Genji's poem: "If the gods who guard the eight islands have hearts, let them censure this parting that leaves us unsatisfied." The meaning is: if the gods can see clearly with divine insight, they should first correct the casual falsehoods of one who speaks of "unsatisfying partings." "Kunitsukami" refers to earthly deities, in contrast to heavenly deities (amatsukami).

If the earthly gods in heaven
are in a position to censure
casual untruths,
let them first
set things right.

He was the elder brother of Usugumo Lady (later Empress). Initially he was Minister of War, and in the "Maiden" chapter became Minister of Ceremonies. This poem was composed when he came to escort the Lady to his residence after Emperor Kiritsubo's death, upon seeing the lower branches of a five-needle pine in the garden withered by snow. The meaning is: has the pine I trusted in for its high branches and broad shade perhaps died? It is indeed a year's end when the lower leaves scatter in all directions. He lamented that the Lady was withdrawing from court after the Emperor, in whose broad imperial favor's shadow he had placed his trust, had passed away.

The pine whose broad shade
I trusted in—
has it withered?
Lower leaves scatter away
in this year's end.

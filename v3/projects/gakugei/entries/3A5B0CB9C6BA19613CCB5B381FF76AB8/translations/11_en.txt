Indeed, in the diary written by Murasaki Shikibu, it states: "How presumptuous, but he inquired whether Wakamurasaki might be around here. When no one resembling Genji appears, how might you be faring?" and so forth. This refers to Saemon-no-kami Kintō playfully calling Murasaki Shikibu "Wakamurasaki."

Although things have become clearer, there are still not few passages that seem somehow unclear. Particularly with interpretations of poems, they only explain the words, and rarely express the heart. Now, without concerning myself with the whole, focusing only on the hundred-odd poems, the method of interpretation differs greatly from the ancient commentaries

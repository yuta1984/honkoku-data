He is the son-in-law of the daughter of the Ono Nun. This poem was composed out of love for Princess Ukifune, whom the Ono Nun was raising after her own daughter had died. The heart of the poem is: "Even if others come courting you, do not yield to them. I will surely make you mine, even though the path from the capital to Ono may be distant." He expresses this sentiment through the metaphor of the maidenflower. "Shimeyuu" means to possess or claim ownership. "Adashi no" refers to another's field, similar to how we say "adashi kuni" (foreign country) or "adashi hito" (stranger).

Maidenflower
of the distant field,
do not bend
to the wind—
I will claim you
as mine,
though the path
be far

She is the sister of the Bishop of Yokawa. This poem was composed as a reply to the above poem, lamenting that although the nun had been thinking in her heart to arrange a meeting between Ukifune and the Middle Captain as a replacement for her deceased daughter, and had urged this in various ways, Ukifune would not listen. The heart of the poem is: "This is supposed to be a grass hermitage where I renounced the world due to the loathsomeness of a world full of various sorrows, yet since I began caring for this princess, I have been handling matters unbefitting a nun and troubling my heart." She expresses this through the metaphor of transplanting maidenflowers in the garden of her hermitage.

Having transplanted
and planted them,
my thoughts
are disturbed—
these maidenflowers
in the grass hermitage
where I turned away
from the sorrowful world

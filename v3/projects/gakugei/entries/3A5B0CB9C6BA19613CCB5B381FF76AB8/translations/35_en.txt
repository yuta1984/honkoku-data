She was a lady-in-waiting to Usugumo Lady (later Empress) and someone who understood Genji's heart. This poem is her reply to Genji's verse, composed at the same time as mentioned above when the Lady was withdrawing from court: "In the clear mirror of the frost-covered pond, how sad not to see the familiar reflection." The meaning refers to how after the Emperor's death, the Lady departed and even her attendants dispersed from sight, comparing this to how a person's reflection fades and becomes invisible in the ice of a rock well.

Lady Ō-myōbu
As the year ends
and Iwai's waters
freeze over,
the reflection I once saw
also fades away.

She was a woman to whom Genji secretly paid visits. This poem is her reply when Genji, returning from elsewhere one morning and passing by this woman's gate, sent in the message: "In the morning twilight's confusion of rising mist, how difficult it is to pass by my beloved's gate." The meaning is: if you find it so disagreeable to pass by, you need not be hindered by such a humble gate—if you have feelings, you should enter. She expresses this sentiment by contrasting the difficulty of crossing the mist barrier with the ease of entering through grass doors. Mist is called a fence because it separates, and grass is called a door because it closes off.

The Woman of the Mist Barrier
If you pause
and find the mist barrier
troublesome to pass,
the grass door
will not hinder you.

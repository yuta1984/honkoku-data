She was the daughter of the lay priest, the former Governor of Harima, who served Genji and gave birth to Akashi Chūgū (Empress). She was one among the many beloved women who resided at Rokujō-in. She was called Fuyu-no-onkata (Winter Lady). This poem was composed as a reply when Genji first secretly visited her and composed: "Would that there were someone with whom to share intimate words—might the dreams of this sorrowful world half awaken?" The meaning is: to a heart that cannot awaken from the sleep of ignorance, there is no way to distinguish and speak of which is dream and which is reality.

Akashi-no-ue (Lady Akashi)
In the undawning night,
my heart remains
immediately bewildered—
which should I call dream
as I try to speak and distinguish?

She was the daughter of the Senior Assistant Governor-General of Kyushu. She was one of the women Genji encountered. She went down to Kyushu with her father and appears in the "Suma" chapter. This poem was composed when Genji was wandering at Suma—she had once inquired after him by letter, and after his return to the capital, she again sent a messenger to express her joy. The meaning is: I, who sent my heart even to your dwelling place at Suma to inquire after you, would like to show you my sleeves that have rotted away with tears from lamenting your wandering. "Yagate" means "immediately" or "directly." She compares herself to a boatman, saying her sleeves have rotted from the waves.

The boatman who
sent her heart
to Suma Bay—
I would show you
the sleeves immediately
rotted away.

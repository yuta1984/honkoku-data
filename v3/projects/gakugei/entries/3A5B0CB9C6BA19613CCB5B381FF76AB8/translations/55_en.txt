She was a daughter of Prince Shikibu-kyō and elder sister of Murasaki no Ue. Due to jealousy arising from the lord transferring his affections to Tamakazura, she returned to her father the prince, as described in the Makibashira chapter. She was a person whose mind was disturbed by spiritual possession. This poem is a response to the poem that began "Ima wa tote yado karenu tomo narekitsuru" which her daughter Makibashira no Ue composed when she was about to return to her father the prince. The meaning is: even if one might recall that the pillar was familiar, why should one stop and linger? She was extremely angry.

Higekuro no Otodo no Kita no Kata
Why should one
stop and linger—
even if one recalls
having grown familiar,
it is but a maki pillar.

She was a lady-in-waiting to Higekuro's principal wife. This poem was composed about Moku no Kimi remaining at this place while she herself followed the principal wife when she departed due to the Tamakazura affair. The meaning is: Compared to the principal wife, Moku no Kimi was only occasionally summoned and their bond was shallow, yet this shallow one remains here as the guardian of the dwelling, while the principal wife departs to distant places—what kind of karma is this? She laments this situation. There is wordplay between "sumi" (clear/pure) and "sumi" (dwell), and "kake" (hang) is paired with "kage" (shadow/reflection).

Yadomoru Chūjō no Kimi
Though shallow,
the water between rocks
remains perfectly clear—
should the lord who guards
this dwelling have his reflection depart?

She was a young attendant of Murasaki-no-ue. This poem was composed when Murasaki-no-ue fell gravely ill and a spirit possessed this young girl, speaking through her. When Genji asked what spirit was tormenting Murasaki-no-ue in this way and demanded it identify itself, this was the spirit's response. The meaning is: though my body has now changed its existence and is no longer in its original form, you remain the same lord as before, yet you pretend not to know me—how heartless! This poem was composed by the vengeful spirit of Rokujō Miyasudokoro speaking through the possessed girl.

The spirit-possessed child
Though my body
has taken on a different form,
you remain
the same lord, yet pretend
ignorance—how cruel!

She was a court lady serving Murasaki-no-ue. This poem was written on her own fan at the end of the first anniversary of Murasaki-no-ue's death and shown to Genji. The meaning is: the tears I shed in longing for you, my lady, have no end, yet the world calls today the conclusion of the first anniversary—what kind of ending can this possibly be? "Kiwa" means "extreme" and has the same meaning as "limit."

Chūjō-kimi of Rokujō-in
The tears I shed
longing for you
have no bounds—
so what kind of ending
can today possibly be?

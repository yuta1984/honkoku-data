This is the Confucian scholar's daughter, and this is her reply to the above poem. The meaning of the poem is: if we were in a relationship where we met continuously without separating our meeting nights, what would be shameful about meeting during the daytime? Since it happens to be so, this is what I say. "Mabayushi" means "shameful" or "embarrassing."

If we were lovers
who did not separate
our meeting nights,
what would be shameful
about the daytime too?

His father is Tō no Chūjō (later the retired Chancellor), and his mother is the sister of Emperor Kiritsubo. He first appeared as Kurōdo Shōshō in the "Hahakigi" chapter 【"hōki" is a vulgar character】 under the name Tō no Chūjō, then progressed through various court ranks, becoming Daijō Daijin in the "Fuji no Uraba" chapter, and submitting his retirement petition in the "Wakana" chapter to go into seclusion. This poem was composed when he decided to allow the relationship between his daughter Kumoi no Kari and Yūgiri, whom he had previously kept apart, and invited Yūgiri under the pretext of a wisteria banquet. The meaning is: would you not come to visit the lingering traces of late spring in this twilight when the wisteria in my garden is in full bloom? Please do come and visit. The underlying meaning is that the woman is waiting, so please come and renew your former connection. "Tasokare" means "who is that person" - referring to the dimness when people cannot be distinguished.

　The Retired Chancellor
At my residence,
in the twilight when
wisteria blooms deep-colored—
will you not come to seek
the remnants of spring?

In contrast, in this Tale of Genji, the temperaments of several hundred characters in the story are written with extremely fine distinctions for each individual person, and throughout the long span from beginning to end, there is not the slightest confusion—whose temperament belongs to whom, his nature belongs to him—everything is thoroughly consistent.

It has the meaning of Musashino." Regarding this passage, there have been various theories since ancient times, but

She is a court lady serving at Lady Yūgao's residence in Gojō. This is the poem she wrote on a fan and presented when Genji ordered his retainer to pluck a yūgao (evening face) flower. The meaning of the poem is that she respectfully surmises that the one who had the yūgao of this mansion plucked, thereby adding honor to the flower, must be the shining Genji, judging by intuition. "Kokoro ate" means to surmise or guess. She expressed the honor as "the light of dew."

By intuition
I wonder if it might be you—
the yūgao flower
to which white dew's
light has been added.

She is the daughter of a minister's family, the former Crown Prince's consort, and the mother of Empress Akikonomu. In the "Sakaki" chapter she accompanies the Ise Priestess to Ise, and in the "Minori" chapter she takes religious vows and dies. She was one of Genji's lovers and became a vengeful spirit. This poem is her reply when Genji had not visited for a long time and only sent letters. The meaning is: though I knew from the beginning that this would be a love that would make me wet my sleeves with tears of anguish, my heart that began to lean toward you suffers. That your affection should be shallow toward one of such low station as myself is only natural. She adds "mud" to the path of love. She compares herself to a lowly rice-field worker who steps down into the mud and wets her sleeves.

Though I knew it was
a path of love that would
wet my sleeves,
it is my own self as a field-worker
stepping into mud that suffers.

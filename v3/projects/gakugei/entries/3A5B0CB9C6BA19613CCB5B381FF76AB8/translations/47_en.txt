She is the wife of Dazai-no-shōni and the mother of Hyōbu-no-kimi and others. This poem was composed as a substitute for a reply poem, since it would have been pitiful not to respond to the aforementioned Taifū-no-gen's poem - she simply expressed her thoughts as a replacement for a proper response. The meaning is: If, contrary to my prayers wishing for Tamakazura's happiness, she were to be pressured by such a man's advances and perhaps forced into submission, then I would find the divine protection resentful.

Yūgao's Wet Nurse
If after years
of faithful prayer
my heart should waver,
would I then view
the mirror deity as cruel?

Her father is the retired minister, her mother is Yūgao. In the "Tamakazura" chapter she became Genji's adopted daughter, in the "Fujibakama" chapter she became Naishi-no-kami, and in the "Makibashira" chapter she became Higekuro's wife and bore children. This poem is a reply to Prince Hotaru Hyōbukyō's poem: "Even the feelings of insects that make no audible cry - do they disappear under people's contempt?" The meaning is: As you say, fireflies that make no sound but burn their bodies away - their feelings must be all the deeper. Speaking one's feelings aloud is rather shallow in comparison.

Tamakazura Naishi-no-kami
Making no sound,
only burning themselves away—
fireflies must feel
emotions deeper
than words can express

She was the daughter of Fujiwara no Koremitsu and served as a dancer in the Gosechi festival. In the Fuji no Uraha chapter, she became Naishi no Suke and was Yūgiri's beloved. This poem is a response to a poem that Yūgiri sent some time after they had met, during the Kamo Festival: "Nani to ka ya kyō no kazashi yo katsu mitsutsu obomelku made mo narinikeru kana." The meaning is: even if you ask me this now, I can only wonder—the reason our meetings have become rare is surely known in the heart of you, my lord, who is learned and knowledgeable. She expresses this by connecting "au" (to meet) with "aoi" (hollyhock). From the classical story in the Chinese chronicles about breaking off a katsura branch, which became associated with passing examinations, and since Yūgiri was a monshōsei (student of literature), she connects the hollyhock of the Kamo Festival with katsura.

Tō-naishi
Even when worn as a garland,
does the one who broke off
the katsura branch
know the name of this grass
that is so hard to find?

She was Kumoi no Kari's wet nurse, who had previously mocked Yūgiri when his rank was low and he wore light blue court robes, calling him "rokui sukuse" (sixth-rank destiny). This poem is her response when Yūgiri, having later become Middle Counselor, retorted about her former mockery with: "Asamidori wakaba no kiku wo tsuyu ni te mo koki murasaki no iro to kakeki ya" (Could you have expected the light green young-leafed chrysanthemum to show deep purple color even with dew?). The meaning is: since you have been a lord of noble lineage from childhood, I never said anything about the relative height or lowness of your early court rank. "Natataru" means "naritaru" (renowned). She likens Yūgiri to a chrysanthemum in her statement.

Taifu no Menoto
From its first two leaves,
this garden chrysanthemum
has been renowned—
there was never any dew
that separated its shallow colors.

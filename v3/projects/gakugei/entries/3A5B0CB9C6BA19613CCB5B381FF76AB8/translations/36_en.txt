She was the daughter of a Minister's family, a consort to Emperor Kiritsubo, and the elder sister of Hanachirusato. This poem is her reply when Genji visited to comfort the sisters who were living in melancholy after Emperor Kiritsubo's death, and he composed: "Drawn by the nostalgic fragrance of orange blossoms, the cuckoo seeks out Hanachirusato to visit." The meaning is: in my home that has fallen into ruin with no visitors, it is the orange tree by the eaves that has become the reason for your visit. She plays on words using "tsuma" (edge/wife) for the eaves' edge and the concept of being "visited" or "asked about."

In this dwelling
fallen to ruin
with no visitors,
the orange blossoms
have become
the edge

She was the younger sister of Lady Reikeiden and one of Genji's beloved women. Later, she was one of many women housed at Rokujō-in. She was called the Summer Lady. This poem was composed when Genji came to bid farewell before his exile to Suma. The meaning is: though my person who is thus visited by you may be insignificant, I wish my heart could at least block and detain you from this reluctant and sorrowful parting. She expresses this by comparing Genji to the moon, likening her own insignificance to the narrowness of sleeves, and describing how she would capture his reflection in her tears.

Lady Hanachirusato
Though the sleeves
where the moon's reflection
dwells
may be narrow,
I would detain
and gaze upon
that inexhaustible
light.

He was the son of the Minister of the Left, who was Right General in the "Bush Clover" chapter and became Right Minister in the "Young Herbs" chapter. This poem was composed when he heard that Tamakazura, to whom he had long been devoted, would enter the imperial court in the tenth month. The meaning of the poem is: If I were of proper standing, I would avoid this inauspicious month, but even exchanging my life for this long month (September) to pursue love is a fleeting thing. This is because there was a custom of avoiding marriage between men and women in the ninth month.

to stake my life on love
seems such a fleeting thing.

He was a son of Prince Shikibu-kyō and a brother of Murasaki no Ue. This poem was composed when he heard that Tamakazura, to whom he had been devoted, would soon enter the imperial court. The meaning of the poem is: Since it has been decided that she will enter the court, this love is fruitless, so I think I should forget her completely, but first the sadness is unbearable. When she actually enters the court, what shall I do? He expresses this sentiment with strong emphasis and repetition.

I should forget
brings such sorrow—
how shall I manage,
how shall I bear it?

The origin of the name "Ryūji" is detailed in the "Record of the Establishment and Religious Practices of This Mountain," so it is omitted here.

Nyohō Sutra Hall: Connected to Bessho, facing east. It is two ken square on four sides, enshrining the Thirty Guardian Deities and a portrait statue of Saint Shōdō. According to one record, in Meitoku 2, Hongū, Shihonryūji, and the subsidiary shrines were all destroyed by fire. They were again destroyed by conflagration on February 4, Daiei 2, and burned down on November 5, Eiroku 5. After reconstruction, since the enshrinement, in Shōhō 4, Great Monk Kōkai added repairs, and in Kanbun 4, there was imperial reconstruction. Later, on December 20, Tenna 4 (renamed Jōkyō 1), a fire started from Rengeishi-machi and spread to this shrine. This is called the Great Conflagration of Mount Nikkō. At this time, this shrine and all others were consumed by fire. In the second year, by imperial command, the shrine head was rebuilt, which is the present shrine complex.

Subsidiary shrines: Kashima shrine, Sannō shrine, Inari shrine, ritual fire ceremony ground

Purple Cloud Stone: Located behind the main shrine. A flat stone about three shaku high and four shaku in diameter.

Pack-hanging Stone: Located to the west of the worship hall. A standing stone over three shaku and five sun high.

Three-story Pagoda: Copper-roofed, located behind the main shrine. It is said that this three-story pagoda was originally built by General Sanetomo in ancient times. Initially it was located near the present main shrine, but was moved to this location through the arrangements of Matsudaira Masatsuna. However, it was destroyed in the Jōkyō disaster, and the present pagoda is a reconstruction from that time.

Three-faced Daikoku Wooden Statue: This is a copy of what Dengyō Daishi enshrined at Mount Hiei for the protection of Buddhism. The reason each Bessho at this mountain enshrines this statue is because of that precedent.

Kamakura-dachi Ritual: Every year on January 2 at noon, there is a ritual called Kamakura-dachi held before the main shrine. The shrine priests, shrine attendants, and shrine personnel of Hongū gather and beat drums in the worship hall. Then they gather at Bessho, and after the banquet concludes, they designate two people who should proceed to Kamakura. These people are given fifty pieces of rice cake, three books of paper, and two hundred mon of coins. They immediately dress for departure, cross the temporary bridge, go as far as the dismounting area, and return.

This is a ritual that commemorates as an auspicious precedent the report sent to Kamakura regarding the victory achieved in battle when enemies attempted to attack this mountain during ancient times of civil war.

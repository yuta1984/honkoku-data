Ancient plaque: A copy of the authentic calligraphy of Kōbō Daishi, treasured at Jōkōji Temple. It is said to have formerly been a plaque of Ōjōin Temple. Length: 1 shaku 8 sun 5 bu, width: 1 shaku 4 sun. Around it are high-relief carvings of cloud dragons, which form the outer frame. Inside this, there is another frame with nine Sanskrit characters. They are in dark blue, while the three characters "Myōgaku-mon" are in gold. A transcription of the characters was presented earlier.

Mukōgawara: Since there are townhouses beyond the bridge over the Daiya River from the direction of Daiku-machi and Itahiki-machi, it is called thus. There are about twenty households on both sides. From there it reaches the main gate road to Ganman. From here, going around Nakimushi Mountain, there is a thoroughfare to the Takigawara area with a path for cattle and horses.

Jiunji Temple: Called Kyarada-san. The hall is three ken square. The principal images are Amida, Jizō, and a statue of Jigen Daishi. The temple grounds are about three to four chō. The restoring founder was Saikyōin Kōkai,

Their strange forms are like the work of demon craftsmen. A stone statue of Fudō is enshrined on top of the rocks. Below the rocks, blue-green water swirls, and the depth of the pool is unfathomable. On the flat surface of the strange rock, about nine shaku wide and seven to eight shaku tall, there are Sanskrit characters for "Ganman," but they are difficult to read.

Reihi Pavilion: At the riverside on this side of Ganman-ga-fuchi, on a place that is all rocky surface, a fire altar (goma-dan) was built, creating a secluded and magnificent scenic spot. A gazebo with round wooden pillars was constructed. This area was originally developed by Priest Kōkai. The stone statue of Fudō, over seven shaku tall on the north bank, was erected by Kōkai, and the Sanskrit characters for "Ganman" on the pool rocks were written by Priest Sanjun. This Sanjun was a disciple of the late Dai-sōjō Shōjun and the third abbot of Yōgenin Temple of this mountain. The fire ritual hall was also built at the same time, and one hundred sessions of seven-day fire rituals were

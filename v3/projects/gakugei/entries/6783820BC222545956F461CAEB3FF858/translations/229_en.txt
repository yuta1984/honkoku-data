　　Inscription and Preface for the Bell of Mount Nikkō
　The Nikkō Dōjō (sacred training ground) was
　established for Tōshō Daigongen. Daigongen possesses immeasurable virtues and should receive immeasurable veneration accordingly.
　The magnificence of its construction is unprecedented in the world, and the filial piety of its continuation increasingly illuminates the achievements of predecessors. Our king, hearing this, rejoiced
　and decided to cast a dharma bell to supplement the offerings to the Three Treasures of the sacred mountain, therefore commanding his retainer Shoku to compose this preface and inscription.
　The inscription reads:
　　Greatly manifest heroic achievements, first opening and expounding the sacred truth. The mystical capital expands in proper order, and the treasure bell is here displayed. Participating in the cultivation of excellent
　　karmic connections, supporting and recommending blessings for the deceased. The whale's sound and lion's roar awaken the benighted and subdue demons. Not merely the weight of the vessel,
　　but truly the principle of filial piety. The dragon-heaven devises this, and great fortune reaches its apex together.

The place where [they] reside is called Rengeishi Village. The origin of this village name comes from a stone called Rengeishi (Lotus Flower Stone) on the left side of the road, and because it is a stone with significance, it is used as the place name.

Dainichi Hall: After passing the aforementioned Rengeishi and walking more than two chō, one takes a slope path descending to the left, where there is a small hall. It enshrines a stone statue of Dainichi Nyorai, with a monks' quarters beside it. In front facing south, there is a clean pond with cold spring water bubbling up from underground. The bottom is entirely made of sand and stones, and the pond is about five to six ken square. Ancient trees flourish, hanging their branches in all directions.

Jakkō: Located west of Kujira Village, the road passes through the plain area mentioned earlier. At the entrance to the main gate path leading to the temple grounds, large ancient cedar trees face each other. From there, walking five to six chō through cedar-lined roads leads to the temple grounds.

Jōnenbutsu Hall: The principal image, the Three Saints Amida, is the work of Eshin Sōzu. This hall issues talismans for nail nenbutsu (nail Buddha invocation). This practice was established by the founding priest Gakugen Shōnin, as detailed in the temple's origin story. In front of this hall, there is something made of stone like a box for depositing talismans used in nail nenbutsu practice.

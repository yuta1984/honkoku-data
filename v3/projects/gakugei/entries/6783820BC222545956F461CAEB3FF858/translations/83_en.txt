About seven ken (approximately 12.6 meters) inside, there is an entrance facing southeast, with a torii gate in front. Within the sacred fence, there is a stone monument called "Sawari Sanbyaku" and one stone lantern. This place is said to be where Takio Gongen manifested.

Stone Monument: This is a monument inscribed with the miraculous deeds of Takio Gongen. There is also a moss-covered stone about three shaku (approximately 90 cm) long, called "Sawari Sanbyaku Dai-Aragami." The general account is as follows: In the fourth month of Kanbun 7 (1667), during the 17th memorial service for Lord Daiyū, a Lotus Sutra ten-thousand-volume assembly was held. Temple disciples gathered in great numbers, and a servant of Sanshun Hōin of Keitō-in at the mountain gate came to Takio, saw the three cedars, and greatly disparaged them with mockery, saying "They are not as tall and grand as I had heard, and the middle cedar is particularly inferior." When he committed this irreverence, before his words were finished, he was struck by chills from behind and his mind and body became disturbed. When he returned home, he raved like a madman without cease, sometimes saying "A god has come and glares at me terrifyingly," trembling and shaking. His companions, knowing this was the curse of a divine spirit, requested prayers from Gakushin Hōin of Jōkō-in on Mount Tai. The master performed ritual prayers, incantations, and sutra recitations for five

days until the divine power gradually departed. At that time, the master compiled a detailed record of the strange phenomena and divine utterances he received. Because the account was extremely detailed, this miraculous event reached the emperor's ears, and a one-volume "Record of Divine Oracle" was presented to the court. This is a monument carved and compiled by Mori Shōron of the Suifu academy in the sixth month of Hōei 3 (1706). The inscription is omitted here.

Fire-Quelling Festival: The second-rank shrine priests of the main shrine oversee the affairs of this shrine. Every year on New Year's Day before dawn, there are ceremonies at the main shrine, so they return from the main shrine to their lodgings and then come to worship at this shrine, necessarily arriving after dusk. However, in previous years, a badger disguised itself as a shrine priest and received hospitality, so since then, even when the real shrine priest comes, they burn green pine needles to smoke out imposters. This practice is called "badger smoking" according to local folk sayings.

Munen Bridge: The bridge leading to the three cedars.

Myōgaku Bridge: The bridge leading toward the child-granting stone.

Tōgaku Bridge: The bridge on the downward path from the same location. Each is a small stone bridge.

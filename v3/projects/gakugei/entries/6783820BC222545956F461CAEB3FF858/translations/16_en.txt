General Description of Mount Nikkō
　Shimotsuke Province was called Kenu Province in ancient times and belonged to what is now Kōzuke Province.
　According to the Kokusō Honki (Record of Provincial Governors), Prince Toyokiiri-hiko, son of Emperor Sujin (the tenth human emperor of the Mizugaki Court), had a grandson named Hikosashima-no-mikoto who first pacified the eastern regions and was granted the lands of fifteen provinces along the Tōsandō (Eastern Mountain Route) as his fief. It is also recorded that this Hikosashima-no-mikoto, great-grandson of the prince from Shiki-no-mizugaki Palace (Emperor Sujin), was granted governorship of the fifteen Tōsandō provinces on the fifth day of the first month of the fifty-fifth year of Emperor Keikō's reign at Makimuku-no-hishiro Palace (the twelfth human emperor). However, he died shortly thereafter, so in the eighth month of the following year, an imperial edict was issued to his son, Prince Mimorowake, stating that since this was the country granted to his father, he should go and govern it.

The thousand-year-old pines and cypresses lean toward the water, casting green canopies; the hundred-span hinoki and cedar trees tower against the cliffs, forming indigo pavilions. Five-colored flowers display mixed hues on a single stem; birds of the six periods respond together yet with different beaks. White cranes dance on the shore, indigo birds play in the water; when they spread their wings it sounds like bells, when they sing their voices ring like jade. Pine winds suspend harps, waves striking rocks tune drums; the five tones compete in performance, heavenly melodies naturally store the eight virtues in tranquility. Mist curtains and cloud drapes sometimes form Nanda's covering; star lamps and thunder torches repeatedly bundle universal fragrance. Seeing the full moon in the pond, one knows Samantabhadra's mirror wisdom; looking up at the sun of compassion in the sky, one realizes universal wisdom within oneself. Entrusting this sacred place, I built a temple and named it Jingūji, residing here in spiritual practice for four years. In the seventh year, fourth month, I moved to the northern shore. The four directions are unobstructed, the sandy ground is lovely; the colors of exotic flowers are indescribable and startle the eye, the fragrance of rare scents is unfathomable and delights the heart. The immortal sages have gone to unknown places, divine beings exist as if in shadowy form. Lamenting the lack of records of yearly spirits, regretting that kings and nobles do not visit, thinking of hungry tigers but not encountering them, seeking Master Ziqiao but finding he has just departed. Contemplating the Lotus Treasury in the ocean of mind, meditating on true reality at Eyebrow Mountain. Using trailing vines to block the cold, shade leaves to avoid heat, eating vegetables and drinking water - joy lies within this. Sometimes walking, sometimes...

Emerging from the dusty world, the crane's cry from the nine marshes easily reaches heaven. During the Enryaku era, Emperor Kashiwabara heard this and appointed him as lecturer of Kōzuke Province, bringing benefit to others. At times with empty mind following things, he also built a Kegon temple at Mount Shiroyama in Tsuga District, going here and there to benefit beings and spread the Way. Departing in Daidō 2, when the province faced calamity, the provincial governor ordered the dharma master to pray for rain. He then ascended Mount Potalaka for prayers, and timely sweet rain poured down abundantly, bringing bountiful harvests. All his Buddhist works cannot be described in detail. Alas, the sun's chariot is hard to stop, human affairs change easily. Following the heart, suddenly arriving at the four snakes, attending to the affairs of weakness and enticement. His able work was completed. Former Shimotsuke scholar-doctor Kō and the dharma master were on good terms; when his term was completed he entered the capital. At that time, the dharma master lamented the lack of records of this sacred realm and requested that I compose a text. Kō and I tried to decline but could not escape, so extracting from emptiness and taking up the brush, I composed this inscription saying:
The yellow of roosters splits the earth and pure qi ascends to heaven; the toad and crow revolve as myriad beings bustle about. Mountains and seas stand in varied formation; the mysterious and bright differ in their paths. Mundane waves arise and perish; true water leads the way. One speck of dust constructs a peak, one drop deepens a lake; dust and streams gather together to adorn the divine capital. The mountain peaks cannot be climbed, the phoenix cannot be depicted. The pristine white snow peaks...

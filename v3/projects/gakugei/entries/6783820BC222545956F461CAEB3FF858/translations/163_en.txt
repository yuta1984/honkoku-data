　In the fourth month of Enryaku 7 (788), it is recorded that [someone] climbed the mountain and moved the Kaan hermitage to the north shore of the lake. This is said to be the site of a temple hall that the high priest established as the foundation at that time, which was also called Fudarakusan Jinguji. It is said that the name Chuzenji originated from this time. "Built a shrine temple and named it Chuzenji." From ancient times, those holding the position of high priest of the mountain would regularly spend limited terms in mountain retreat conducting temple affairs, but in Kanei 2 (1625), due to certain circumstances, it became the possession of the main temple. Even now, it is managed by members of the mountain clergy, with usually one monk from a sub-temple and one retainer of the main temple taking turns in residence, plus one or two servants living there. Also, among the sub-temples, the "shore duty" is served in seven-year rotations. The shrine families of the sacred shrine also conduct the shrine affairs of the Three Shrine Gongen according to the order of seniority.

Eternal Fire　At this sacred site, fire has never been extinguished since the beginning of the world. Large logs are continuously fed into the great hearth in the kitchen, never letting it die out winter or summer. Therefore, the local people say it is "fire from the age of the gods." It is the local custom that houses throughout Nikko mountain and the various towns initially obtain fire from here and arrange to keep it burning continuously in their own homes.

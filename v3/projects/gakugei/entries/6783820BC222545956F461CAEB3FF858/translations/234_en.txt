On the beams are carvings of dragons in plain wood, and on the front is a round carving of one tiger. The pillars are white wood with Chinese wood coloring, and the overall ground pattern consists of round dragons and round lions. The pillar bases are wrapped in red copper with colored metal fittings, and the upper parts of the pillars also have gilt metal fittings. Above the front lintel are carvings of Confucius and his Ten Disciples, and on the opposite gable is a phoenix. In the transoms are carved Chao Fu and Xu You, or the Seven Sages, Seven Lucky Gods, and others. These are gilt metal fittings with carvings attached to a textured ground. The ceiling has celestial beings carved in plain wood. Both doors are made of Chinese wood with carvings of chrysanthemums, peonies, plums, and other flowers. The other intricate carving work is beyond description.

Bronze Sacred Lantern: One base, located to the east outside the Chinese Gate. This is said to be a meaningful donation, but since it bears no inscription, its history is unknown.

Sacred Fence: Extending from both sides of the Chinese Gate around the Main Hall and Worship Hall, with copper roofing and openwork carving in ground patterns. The transoms have relief carvings of plants, flowers, and birds in color.

Worship Hall: The interior beyond the Chinese Gate is not a place where ordinary people can observe in detail, so it is difficult to know. Even when worshipping from the lower level, it is impossible to retain even one-tenth of its magnificence in one's mind.

It is difficult, and even what one occasionally hears is deeply secret, so only the general aspects are recorded here. The front of the Worship Hall is approximately eleven to twelve ken, and the width is about four to five ken. From the front worship area to inside the Chinese Gate is stone-paved. The common people worship at this stone-paved area. Now, facing the stone pavement are the sacred steps - five levels completely covered with gilt metal fittings. Above hang three sacred gongs, all golden in color. The front veranda and railings are both black lacquered, the interior pillar facings are entirely gold-leafed, and the outer wall plates above have high-relief phoenixes in plain wood with gold coloring. The Chinese doors are black lacquered with gold arabesque maki-e. The ceiling of the front main room is a double coffered ceiling with folded edges, within which are colored round dragons in rock ultramarine, each different in form. On the interior ceiling beams hang plaques of the Thirty-six Immortal Poets. The waka poems are in the imperial calligraphy of Emperor Go-Mizunoo. The paintings are said to be by Tosa-no-shōgen. The sliding doors on the east and west sides - the east has bamboo and qilin in color on gold ground, while the west side has paintings of lions. These are said to be by Tan'yū. The eastern room of the Worship Hall is called the Sacred Audience Chamber.

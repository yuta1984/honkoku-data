Abe Kūen's Grave Monument (Located within Niō Gate, north of the Sacred Ablution Hall, outside the stone sacred fence, and further beyond where there are barrier posts and sacred palisades, positioned between the inner and outer sacred enclosures)

This is the grave of Abe no Asomi Tadaaki, Junior Fourth Rank, Acting Chamberlain and Governor of Bungo Province. He was the son of Samanosuke Masayoshi, second son of Harima no Kami Masakatsu. From around the 15th year of Keichō, when he was young, he was assigned to serve the young lord (Iemitsu), and later became known as Bungo no Kami Tadaaki. From his childhood, he served diligently from early morning until night without neglect. In the 12th month of Genna 9, he was granted court rank and received one character ("Tada") from the lord's name. In the 1st month of Kan'ei 1, he was granted his father's inherited domain combined with his own territory. In the 2nd month of the same 2nd year, he was granted additional lands of grace. In the same 3rd year, he was again granted territory. In the 1st month of the same 14th year, he was granted Mibu Castle in Shimotsuke Province, and in the 1st month of the 16th year, he moved to Oshi Castle in Musashi Province. On the 5th day of the 9th month of Keian 2, when the Dainagon family (Iemitsu) moved to the Western Castle, Tadaaki was appointed to the position of senior retainer. In the 8th month of the same 8th year, he was appointed as chamberlain. In the 2nd month of Kanbun 3, he was granted additional territory. On the 25th day of the 5th month of the 11th year, he retired, and died on the 3rd day of the 5th month of Enpō 3. His Buddhist posthumous name was Tōgenin Tenkoku Kūen Daikoji.

His memorial tablet is housed in Ryūkōin. Only the two characters "Kūen" are carved on the monument. In recent years, a stone covering has been made for this pagoda, with a roof-like form on top. The total height is about three shaku, and each of the four sides measures one shaku four to five sun. The front face is carved with an opening like a window, made so that the two characters can be seen. Since he had made a request to the Shogun family before his retirement, he commanded his heir and retainers, leaving the testament: "After my death, abandon my body near the Sacred Mausoleum." Therefore, he was buried in a place near the sacred enclosure. This person's monument stone is located around the inner enclosure of Niō Gate. Also, the Kaji family tomb is located on Midō-yama near the Sacred Inner Sanctuary. Each faces the Sacred Main Hall from front and back respectively. It is said that this represents their perpetual vow to serve even in the afterlife.

Kegon Falls: This waterfall flows down from Lake Chūzenji, with the waterway running approximately seven to eight chō before reaching the mouth of the falls. This waterway is also like a branch of a river, with a width of over ten ken, or in some places seven to eight ken. From Nanko (South Lake), it flows four to five chō and has a plank bridge built across it. This is called Nangan Bridge. It is about ten ken long. This bridge serves as a passage to Utahama (Song Beach). Also, for those who come via Ashio from the Jōshū region, they traverse a divergent path from the summit of Ashio Pass for approximately two ri, overcoming treacherous terrain to arrive here. Those who take the main road to visit Chūzenji Temple will find a flat path that branches left at the roadside of Ōtaira, following it for about five to six chō to reach the vicinity of this waterfall. This is the source of the Daiya River. It is said to be seventy-five jō high. This waterfall is the foremost waterfall in the Tōkan region, with the falls' mouth over two ken wide. The area below the falls is not accessible to people.

Such was the situation, and the common people were troubled by this. Later, in the 11th year of Kōnin (820 CE), when the monk Kūkai ascended the mountain, he performed exorcism and established a sacred boundary around that cave area, and renamed the mountain Nikkō. From that time, the annual violent winds ceased, and the people throughout the country were finally able to feel at peace. The shrine priest of this mountain, the Ono clan, also served as shrine officials of Chūzenji Temple, and every year they would go to the rocky cave of Nikō and perform secret rituals to calm the winds in spring and autumn seasons—rituals inherited from the monk Kūkai and kept as family secrets of the Ono clan. This is recorded in that family's old records. However, during the Tenna era (1681-1684), due to certain circumstances, that family line was discontinued.

During the Bunmei era (1469-1487), in the "Travel Journal Around the Provinces" by Prince Dōkō of Shōgoin Palace, it states: "A poem composed upon climbing Mount Nikkō. Also, in ancient times it was called Mount Nikō."
　"Even clouds and mist cannot reach this high mountain peak, where the sunlight shines with special brilliance"

Also, in the section on village names in the "Wamyōshō," among the village names within Tsuga District of Shimotsuke Province, "Futa" is written, but today no trace of this name can be heard in the nearby villages. Perhaps it was located in the foothills around Mount Nikō.

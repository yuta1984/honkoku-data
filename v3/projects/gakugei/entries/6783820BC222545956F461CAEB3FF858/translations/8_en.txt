Although the divine authority is truly unbearable in its terrifying majesty, I have harbored the ambition to write a Record of Nikkō for many years now. My humble intention is solely to add to the brilliance of Mount Kōgaku (Nikkō) and fulfill the hopes of believers, never knowing that divine punishment might approach me. What is truly lamentable is that I am naturally dull-witted, and moreover self-taught and ignorant. Yet my long-cherished desire is extremely great while my talent and ability are exceedingly meager. How could I not strive? Therefore, carrying my book bag and staff, I have traveled back and forth to Mount Futaara dozens of times already, never tiring of my investigations, unaware that my spiritual contemplation was about to diminish. Questioning this person and consulting with that one, I finally collected the general outline, accumulating several hundred sheets of paper. I then divided it into five volumes and titled it "Records of Mount Nikkō." I think that the supreme victories and miraculous sites of Mount Kōgaku could hardly be limited to just these five volumes. What I record now is merely, so to speak, one hair from nine oxen. As for exhausting the ultimate essence of this sacred region and collecting facts from ancient to modern times, I must await the compilation of future wise men.

One: Although the biography of the founding monk appears in the Shōryōshū, Genkō Shakusho, Kōsōden and other works, each has its discrepancies. If I were to excerpt everything from these sources, truth and falsehood would become mutually confused, only increasing readers' doubts. Therefore, I now take only what is correct and include it in this collection. Works like the Kōsōden, for instance, vacillate between the positions of Master Yazan and Kokan, merely appearing and disappearing between the two. Moreover, theories that originate from the author himself err in sectarian matters or contradict various theories, with nothing worth adopting. Why would I be mired in literary flourishes and destroy the truth? This is why I do not excerpt everything.

One: The most reliable sources for verifying historical facts are the Nikkōzan Engi, the Retso-den, the Takinoo Konryūki, the Senbue Nikki, the Ōko Gyōjishū, the Sangatsu-e Engi, and others. However, all of these have been secret records of the record-keeper's office since ancient times, and even the clergy of the entire mountain are not easily permitted to view them. Among lay people, only Lord Karasumaru Mitsuhiro has perused them. How could someone of my vulgar status possibly glimpse these documents?

The temple became ruins.

After the enshrinement of the imperial shrine, in Genna 7 (1621), the main temple was built at the old site of Kōmyōin, but in Kan'ei 18 (1641), the main temple was rebuilt at the present location.

Successive Head Priests of Nikkō

Founder: Saint Shōdō

Although the saint was the founder, since he did not receive an imperial edict for the head priest position, he is not called a head priest but is only referred to as the founder. Priest Dōchin, who was the saint's leading disciple and his legitimate successor, was also not appointed to the head priest position. Since Priest Kyōmin was the first to receive imperial appointment as head priest, he is called the founding ancestor of this mountain. With Dai-Sōjō Jigen as head priest, the head priest position was temporarily discontinued, so from Zazenin Shōyu to Shōson, they were only called Acting Deputy Administrators (Gon-bettō).

When the Great Lord ended his reign, by his dying command he was buried at Futarasan in Shimotsuke Province. The lord escorted the sacred coffin and finally established his residence there. From this time for forty-seven years, he bowed at the mausoleum every morning, never neglecting this duty even in severe cold, heat, or rain. The lord's personal name was Sadayoshi, and in his later years he took the Buddhist name Sanyū Koji. Initially he became the adoptive son of his foster father. When the foster father later had a biological son, he yielded the succession to that child. By special imperial decree he was granted a stipend of 200 hyō of rice and became a minor attendant. During the Kan'ei period his stipend was repeatedly increased to 600 koku. He was promoted to minor treasurer. During the time of Lord Gen'yū, he was granted Junior Fifth Rank and his stipend increased to 1,000 koku. During the time of Lord Jōken, he advanced to Junior Fourth Rank and his stipend was again increased to 2,000 koku. The favor and attention of both reigns was profound, with honors and rewards arriving continuously. Though he was sometimes summoned to court, the lord firmly maintained his original aspiration and made this his life's work. While the lord was in Shimotsuke Province, he would rise at cockcrow, bathe and purify himself, visit the mausoleum at dawn, sit alone before the hall, bow with reverent awe, solemnly serving as if his lord were still alive. During the transition from winter to spring, standing in freezing wind and cold snow, he would often become so stiff that his body froze and his mouth could not speak. At age eighty-five he grew somewhat weak and began using a palanquin to travel, but when entering the mausoleum gate, he never used a walking stick. The lord constantly said, "Having received my lord's benevolence, engraved in my bones and penetrating my marrow, though I am old, to attend the mausoleum daily is how I can repay my original aspiration."

After finishing these words, he would sigh deeply. On the 14th day of the 5th month of Genroku 11, he died of illness at his residence in Shimotsuke Province. From his birth in Keichō 17, he lived eighty-seven years. He was buried behind the burial ground of the Great Lord Daiyū. Thus his aspiration was fulfilled. Duke Yoshimune of Mito composed a memorial text for him, saying: "I have heard of filial children who built huts at their parents' graves, but I have never seen a loyal retainer who built a hut at his lord's grave. Now I see this in this lay monk." The lord was intelligent from youth: at seven he could ride, at eleven he could use a bow, at seventeen he studied military strategy. His decision to decline becoming his foster father's heir was made when he was only nineteen years old. Upon reaching maturity, he took no pleasure in music and women, sought neither warmth nor satiation, and was extremely frugal in his personal maintenance. However, when it came to purchasing fine horses, he would not begrudge a thousand gold pieces. Indifferent to power and profit, he conducted himself with humility. Though his rank reached Fourth Rank, he did not use it for self-aggrandizement. Whenever he stood with court nobles, he would always defer to a lower position. Though his stipend reached 2,000 koku, he did not use it for personal luxury, but found joy in charitable relief and giving. During the floods of Kanbun and the fires of Jōkyō, he petitioned the government for disaster relief, and many people of Shimotsuke Province relied on this to survive. The lord never married throughout his life.

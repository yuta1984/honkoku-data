　Both questions and answers were perfectly exhausted. The testimony was naturally delivered by the Great High Priest, who particularly illuminated his wisdom over the vast sea, and his eloquence flowed like a rushing river. When he judged it as "immediate original first-last non-duality," the logic was established, representing immeasurable merit. After the dharma seat concluded, Sakai Bingo-no-kami, the lord of Kawagoe Castle, had many legs (stands) piled up with offerings, which looked as if the mountains themselves had started to move. This castle grounds was the renowned village of Miyoshino. This was the place where the poem "When shall I forget the five guards in residence" was composed. Since Tenman Tenjin is the guardian deity, pine trees could be seen among the intervals of flowers. Perhaps the geese of Musashino came in longing, as they cried in two or three voices in the same formation:
　　The geese must be tracing the return path, crying as their hearts are drawn to the flowers of Miyoshino
　Among the retinue, seeing flowers being lured by the reliable wind:
　　Let the resentment of many people who do not shelter the spring wind in their sleeves accumulate, O flowers of Miyoshino

　On the 29th day, they traveled about one ri from Sano to a place called Koshikubo. It is said to be where Great Master Jigaku took his first bath as an infant. With Iwafune Jizo Satta hanging to the left, it was an unconcealed demonic place. There was a sacred appearance of what is called the divine palanquin's sickle.
　The High Priest carried the sword-rope seal and other implements, and with many guards, what hindrance could there be? Without distinction of high, middle, or low rank, they passed through Tomida and beyond the place called Tochigi, where the famous Muro-no-Yashima came into view. It was a renowned place where both Lords Shunzei and Teika had composed excellent poems. In memory of them, the smoke from their hearts made the sky feel narrow, and tears flowed more than water. Thus they arrived at Kanuma. Saying that spring had ended in less than a full day, the Buddhist service was conducted as usual. After the sermon, tonight let us each lament the end of the third month.

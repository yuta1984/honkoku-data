　　Compassionate Heart Bird
The sacred bird of the divine mountain calls its own name; in the thin night among layered peaks, shadowy sounds arise
The parrot has long ceased its palace chatter, the kalavinka has already escaped the sounds of the world
In the jeweled forest, it picks flowers at open places and departs; at the jade palace, passing time, it sings toward the moon
The tree colors are deep and profound, invisible; the heavenly wind blows across the Brahma King's castle
　　　　　Shimei Jō (Purple Sea Stallion)

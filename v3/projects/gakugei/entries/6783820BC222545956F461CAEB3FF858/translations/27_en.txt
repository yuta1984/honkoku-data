The fire watch stations were also moved to this side street after the great fire of Tenmei era. Originally, one station was in Iri-machi, and both locations were established for fire prevention, but at the beginning of the Kansei era, one group was abolished for certain reasons.

Shimo-Hatsuishi-machi and Naka-Hatsuishi-machi: Taking the direction toward the sacred mountain precincts as "upper," they are divided into three towns: upper, middle, and lower. The street extends for about seven chō. Continuing from Gokō-machi, these three towns serve the official post-horse relay station. There are three or four honjin (official inns) and other lodgings. At the bottom of Kami-Hatsuishi slope is the post-horse office, and the wholesale agent Sugie Tazaemon oversees these matters. Behind the houses of Naka-Hatsuishi-machi is a large stone resembling a bowl, from which the town takes its name.

Kami-Hatsuishi-machi: This place has shops on both sides selling local specialties including joinery work, lacquerware, bent woodwork, trays and bowls, food containers, and various other goods, with their eaves lined up in a row.

Kannon-ji Temple: Called Hatsuishi-zan. It is a direct branch temple of our mountain. Located at the foot of the mountain south of Naka-Hatsuishi-machi, with a Kannon Hall in the precincts. The principal image is said to be the work of Kōbō Daishi. This temple serves as the bodai-sho (family temple) called Kōge-in for the people of Hatsuishi-machi.

This temple is said to have existed since ancient times.

Geba (Dismounting Place): Leaving Kami-Hatsuishi-machi, at the foot of the mountain to the left of an area that opens in all directions, a stone pillar for dismounting is erected. Local people call this place "Geba." Going down a little toward the opposite side, there are the Sacred Bridge and a temporary bridge.

Hoshi-no-miya (Star Shrine): At the foot of the mountain south of Geba, ancient cedar trees surround the shrine area. Though this shrine is small, it is a sacred place of great importance to both clergy and laity of Nikkō. The reason for omitting its detailed history here is [as follows]: When the founding patriarch of our mountain was still very young, his childhood name was Fujito-maru. In the 13th year of Tenpyō, year of the Metal Ox, when Fujito-maru was seven years old, one autumn night, the Bright Star Heavenly Child suddenly descended and personally announced: "Nikō-zan has been since the age of the gods a sacred land where Ōnamuchi-no-mikoto, Tagori-hime-no-mikoto, and Ajisuki-takahikone-no-mikoto have manifested, and the three deities eternally reside on that mountain peak. You have deep karmic connections with the three deities and possess considerable spiritual capacity. Quickly develop great resolve, traverse those mountains and rivers, and encounter the three deities."

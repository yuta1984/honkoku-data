Naka-no-chaya (Middle Tea House) - Since the slope becomes steep and difficult to climb above Misawa, a rest station has been established here.

Fudō Hall - According to ancient records, the founding master ordered Kyōbin, Dōchin, and others to construct the hall buildings and enshrine the Fudō deity. From here, passing through a place called Ōdaira, one reaches the precincts of Chūzenji Temple. According to another account, in the 11th year of Kōnin era (820), when Kōbō Daishi climbed the mountain, Ajari Shinsai also climbed together and built Kegon-ji Temple at Ejiri, enshrining the Fudō deity - this is said to refer to this location.

Ōdaira - From this area to the Chūzenji precincts, the terrain is generally flat, with only bamboo grass (kumazasa) abundant along the roadside. The other ancient trees layer their blue-green foliage so thickly that sunlight never penetrates, making this a place of deep clouds and mist. Therefore, hanging from the treetops in abundance are pale blue, leafless stems resembling mugwort that extend three to four shaku in length, clinging to and draping from the ancient trees. This plant grows in deep mountains everywhere and is called "saruogase" (old man's beard lichen).

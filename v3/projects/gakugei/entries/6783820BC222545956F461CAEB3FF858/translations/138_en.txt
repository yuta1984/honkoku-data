　In ancient times there were twenty-one temple quarters for the shrine monks of Sannō, and they occupied the land south of the shrine grounds to build
　temples and perform shrine duties, also maintaining Dainichi Hall. Therefore this area prospered, and since it was of the same sect as Nikkō,
　it was under their control, but when they wanted to establish separate rules and did not comply with orders,
　forces from the mountain came and completely destroyed all the temple quarters and below. Therefore, it is said that
　the Buddhist services of Dainichi Hall and the shrine duties of Sannō came to be performed by Nikkō-san.
Kujira Village: In ancient times it was written as "Kujira." This place is northeast of Rengeishi Village, located
　west of Midō Mountain, and from the northwest to the entrance of Jakkō's mountain forest, from west to south the dangerous mountains of Arasawa
　continue. The area within about fourteen to fifteen chō east-west and seven to eight chō north-south is called Kujira Village.
　Four shrine families of the honorable shrine live near the mountains to the north, and the remaining villagers also reside there. All live
　scattered at the foot of the mountains. It gradually slopes down from north to south, but generally there is
　open land suitable for cultivation. Now, "Kujira" is said to be a place name with significance related to Nikkō Gongen.
　In ancient times when the shrine was moved to Utsunomiya, a place name called "Tō-Kujira" was also moved to that land.

　"Tō" (outer) was moved, like in "Tōyama" (outer mountain), and since this land was the old site, it had the meaning of being moved elsewhere.
　Therefore it was also written as "Tō-Kujira," but in later times this was abbreviated and changed, and now it is
　written as "Tokujirō," thus becoming a person's name. This theory also lacks proper evidence, but
　I have attached my humble opinion based on what I heard transmitted from ancient times.
Nuka-zuka (Bran Mound): This mound is south of Dainichi Hall beyond Rengeishi, separated by the Daiya River.
　The local people call it Nuka-zuka. For what reason it was built is completely unknown, having lost its origins. Recently
　a small Inari shrine is said to be enshrined on top of the mound, and there are also many stones
　gathered and piled up in the vicinity. The reason for this is unknown.
Ike-ishi (Pond Stone): This is beside the Jakkō road, a stone about five to six fathoms in size, about six feet high, smooth on top with a concave
　area about three by four feet, over one foot deep. It is sometimes called "Iki-ishi" (Living Stone). Even during droughts it does not
　dry up.
Renge-ishi (Lotus Stone): Passing through Hara-machi and crossing the valley called Tamozawa, private houses line both sides

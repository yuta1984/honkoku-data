old site where the founding master once built a temporary grass hermitage before moving to Shihonryūji temple. Later, the master buried his inkstone beneath this stone, hence it came to be called the Inkstone Stone, according to tradition.

Worship Stone: This stone is so named because when the master resided in the grass hermitage here, Kannon Bodhisattva appeared in the direction of Shiun Rock, and the master worshipped respectfully from atop this stone, gazing into the distance. After the master moved to Shihonryūji temple, a monastery was established at the site of his former hermitage, where his chief disciple, Vinaya Master Ninchō, came to reside. Initially called Iwamoto-bō, it was later renamed Hashimoto-bō, and finally Vinaya Master Ninchō passed away at this location. The site of this ancient temple remains within the current precincts of Yuishin-in.

Jinshaō Shrine: Serves as the guardian deity of the Sacred Bridge. It enshrines Bishamonten as its honji. Located at the entrance to Nagasaka slope, facing south with a tochi bark roof, it displays a placard reading "Jinshaō" on its torii gate. This is written in the hand of the head priest of this mountain, Prince Kōben, First Rank Quasi-Empress of Daimyō-in Palace. Three stone lanterns stand before the shrine. The Bishamonten statue, which serves as the honji of Jinshaō here, is a sacred image carved by the founding master's own hands in ancient times.

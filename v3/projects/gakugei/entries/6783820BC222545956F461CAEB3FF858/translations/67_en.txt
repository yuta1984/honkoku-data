During the Bun'ei era under Emperor Kameyama,
During the Kōan era under Emperor Go-Uda, when the Mongol barbarians attempted to attack our country, on both occasions the Nikkō head priest received imperial commands and together with the great assembly offered sincere prayers for the subjugation of the barbarians in the shrine hall of this shrine. On the morning of the completion of the seven-day prayer period, the shrine altar shook three times, and suddenly a divine whistling arrow flew westward with a cry, and its destination was unknown. Shortly thereafter, all the foreign warships were destroyed by storms, as recorded in the old records of this shrine. Not only regarding the auspicious signs of the destruction of enemies of the court through the generations, but the miraculous responses correspond to the earnest prayers of all people just as an echo follows a voice.

When the divine mausoleum of the Great Divine Ancestor first came to be enshrined here, what had been severed was reconnected and what had declined was revived. In the fifth year of Genna, this shrine was newly rebuilt, and complete repairs were made to everything including the Chinese gate, worship hall, and sacred food hall. The patron was

The "Kaikoku Zasshi" (Record of Travels Around the Country) states: Thirty ri up this mountain there is Chūzenji Temple where a gongen deity stands guard. I climbed the mountain and spent the night in vigil. Tonight was especially the thirteenth night, and the moon was more beautiful than anywhere else. There was a vast lake, and at a place called Uta-no-hama (Song Beach), the autumn leaves competed in color, reflected in the moonlight, so I boarded a boat and composed:
"At Shikishima's Uta beach, drawing my boat to shore, I gaze at the moon with autumn leaves as my ornament"

The next day, on the path leaving Chūzenji, scattered autumn leaves were visible between the morning frost, so I spoke to a monk-soldier called Nagato no Jūsha who was serving as my guide:
"Through the morning frost of deep mountain valleys I tread, bringing out the colors of the autumn leaves below"

As I descended the mountain in this way, passing the foot of Kurokami-yama (Black Hair Mountain), both I and others composed and left behind this poem:

"Though I may despise this aged body of mine, even Black Hair Mountain must await the snow"

Seeing horses that had come as escorts at the foot of the same mountain:
"After many days, even the horse I ride has changed its coat on the rocky cliff path of Black Hair Mountain"

Great Torii Gate: Made of bronze, standing at the edge of the lake. From here one climbs stone steps, then from level ground climbs two more sets of stone steps to reach the front of the Kannon Hall.

Goma Hall: Three ken by four faces. Located in front of the Kannon Hall, reached by climbing stone steps.

Bell Tower: Two ken by three ken. The bell is ancient and mentioned in records, but the current bell was cast during the Bunka era.

Three-Story Pagoda: Red-lacquered, three ken square. Houses the Five Wisdom Buddhas. Located on the right side.

Saitō Goma Hall: To the east of the bell tower. Behind this building there is a wall built one story higher.

Ancient Cauldrons: Two vessels located beside the Goma Hall. Diameter of three shaku, five to six sun. They bear inscriptions. One reads "Second year of Jōwa (1346), second month, Sacred Record, Amida Buddha, respectfully donated to Chūzenji Temple." The other bears an inscription from the 33rd year of Ōei, but the rest is difficult to read. The bottoms have rotted and are damaged in places. These cauldrons are somewhat large in size.

There is a Kannon Hall containing the thirty-second Kannon of the thirty-three sacred places of this province, created by Great Master Jikaku, and also houses a Benzaiten statue created by Monk Eshin. This temple is an ancient site where the youngest son of Hatakeyama Shigetada became a monk called Ajari Jūkei and built a hermitage. Jūkei was unexpectedly killed and the temple was abandoned for a while, but after years passed, the head priest of this mountain rebuilt it. The Azuma Kagami states:

On the 19th day of the 9th month of Kenryaku 3 (1213), Benkaku, the head priest of Mount Nikkō, sent a messenger reporting: "Ajari Jūkei, the youngest son of the late Hatakeyama Jirō Shigetada, has secluded himself at the foot of this mountain, gathering rōnin (masterless samurai), and performed heart-rending prayers. This is undoubtedly plotting rebellion." At that time, Naganuma Gorō Munemasa was present and was ordered to capture Jūkei alive. Munemasa immediately rode out, cut off Jūkei's head, and brought it to Kamakura. However, the Shogun had ordered that "Hatakeyama Shigetada was not a rebel, and since this is his son who became a monk, he should be brought back alive," so the killing was unnecessary. This greatly displeased the Shogun, and Munemasa, feeling this was against his intentions, made various complaints to the officials at the Board of Retainers and withdrew.

Kōnosu-yama: The local people mispronounce it and also write it as Kōnosu, or mistakenly transmit it as Kōnodai. This is a high mountain south of the Ishiya-machi area, about one ri to climb, with a distant view of several dozen ri to the southeast. This entire area consists of barren mountains, with a flat summit about ten ken square.

Inari-machi: Also called Demachi. Originally there were townhouses east of the main shrine grounds, as well as inspector's residences and fire watch residences, and because there was a guardian Inari shrine, it was called Inari-machi. The river was also named Inari River, referring to the valley stream that still flows east of the main shrine. The source of this valley stream comes from a deep mountain ravine called Nanataki (Seven Falls), northwest of Takino-o Mountain. During the Kanbun era, the mountain at the water source unexpectedly collapsed, causing sudden floods and torrential flows that swept away the inspector's residences, fire watch residences, townhouses, Inari-machi, Hagigaki-machi and others simultaneously, with over three hundred people drowning. Afterward, the townhouses were moved to this location, hence it is also called Demachi. It extends from the eastern back of Ishiya-machi and Gokō-machi to the side street of Shimo-Hatsuishi-machi. This side street was also called Otome-machi or Hi-no-ban-yokochō. Because the shrine attendants lived there

While people wondered at this strange occurrence, the monk suddenly came back to life and told of his recent experience: "I went to the palace of King Enma, where the great king told me: 'You should not have come here now, but many sentient beings in the world of delusion fall into hell due to wrong views. I will show you the form of hell so that you may save sentient beings.'" Following the great king's teaching, he toured the hells. There were 136 great hells, and countless other hells whose number was unknown. Seeing those who suffered, he could not bear the sadness and lamentation. King Enma declared: "Ordinary people, driven by greed, create evil without limit, so after death, during the forty-nine days, forty-nine nails are driven into them. According to the depth of their karmic sins, the nails vary in length - six sun, eight sun, or even one shaku six sun. Three in the head, two each in the left and right shoulders, six in both hands, twenty in the belly, fourteen in the sides, four each in the left and right feet - totaling forty-nine. When these nails are driven in, the cries of anguish reach up to the highest heaven.

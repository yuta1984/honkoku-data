It takes its name from its call, similar to how the Buddha-Dharma-Sangha bird (Japanese dollarbird) gets its name. It often calls during early summer. It dwells not only in these mountains but also abundantly in Arasawa, Jakko, and around Kuriyama. Sometimes it flies around and calls even within the sacred mountain precincts. It rarely comes to places with many human dwellings. Its feet are divided into two front and two back toes. The feather colors are as shown in the illustration. Its form is about the size of a brown-eared bulbul. I previously went to Mount Haruna and stayed at a shrine priest's house, where the host told me that three-treasure birds and precept-keeping birds dwell on that mountain. The three-treasure bird rarely calls. The precept-keeping bird calls late at night, he said, but since I went early in spring, it did not call. That precept-keeping bird is the same as the compassionate heart bird, the house owner told me.

Sala Tree: Also called sala twin trees, commonly known as summer camellia. Perhaps because it blooms around April and May. However, it differs greatly from camellia. It grows abundantly in the mountains.

Nantai-san: It is called by various names including Niko-san, Fudaraku-sen, Kurokami-yama, Kurokami-yama, Nikko-san, and Nantai-san. The theory about the transformation from "Niko" was discussed in the previous volume, so I omit it here. Also, the name Kurokami-yama

appears in the Man'yoshu collection and was an ancient designation. An elder told me that although this high mountain has deep snow accumulation, from the base to the summit, ancient trees of pine, fir, cypress, hemlock and others create dense green foliage that appears pitch black in the hazy distance, hence the name's origin.

According to one theory, in ancient times this country was named Ke-no-kuni (Hair Country). "Ke" (hair) means maturity or ripeness. What grows from seeds sown in fields is called sakumo (crop yield), and land that does not mature crops is called fumo-no-chi (barren land). This country too, since the age of gods, has had trees established on high mountains, so perhaps the country's name arose from this. Also, "ke" refers to the growth and maturation of grasses, trees, rice and vegetables, which is why it might be called Kurokami-yama (Black Hair Mountain). This theory also seems to be reasonable. Also, from the name Nantai-san came the designations of the two children, Ōmanago and Komanago. Now, climbing from Zenjōguchi at the base is about three ri of straight road. Three shrines are enshrined at the summit. The summit's expanse is about ten chō north-south and about three chō east-west. The climbing path has no dangerous places where the road is cut off by steep rocks, making the ascent easy. Therefore, the ancient trees grow luxuriantly...

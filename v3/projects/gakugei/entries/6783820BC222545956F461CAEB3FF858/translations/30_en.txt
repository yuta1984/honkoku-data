　Being deeply moved by the remarkable divine assistance, and increasingly forgetting dangerous concerns, he finally crossed that long bridge together with his disciples. When they reached the northern shore and looked back into the distance, strangely enough, both the great king and the two serpents had vanished as if dissolved into thin air.
　From then on, this bridge came to be called the Serpent Bridge of Yamasuge. Also, during the Daidō era (806-810), when military conflicts arose in the imperial capital and weapons were already being taken up, the imperial court offered earnest prayers to the deity of this mountain. Soon after, peace returned to the realm, so in gratitude, the shrine buildings of Nikkō Gongen were newly rebuilt, and the Yamasuge Bridge also became a large bridge for the first time. Until then, the master had only constructed a small bridge with his disciples at the site of the former serpent bridge - it was merely a very small bridge. After it came to be called Yamasuge Bridge or the Serpent Bridge of Yamasuge, this eventually became the common name. Now it is exclusively called the Sacred Bridge (Shinkyō). In the Shunshōshō commentary on the Pillow Book, citing a variant text, it writes "a single plank bridge called Yamasuke-no-hashi," which probably describes exactly how the small bridge was barely constructed in ancient times.

　Now, as mentioned in the previous section, in Daidō 3 (808), when Tachibana no Toshitō, the provincial governor of this province, received the imperial edict for constructing this mountain temple, he commanded a man called Yamazaki Dayū, who lived at the foot of the mountain and was both a shrine attendant and craftsman, to build the first large bridge, making it easy for people to cross. From then on, there was an order to rebuild it once every sixteen years, and the descendants of Yamazaki Dayū have carried out this work for generations. Since Yamazaki Dayū commonly went by the name Chōbei, the local people always called him "Bridge-builder Chōbei."
　The Kaikoku Zakki states: "On this mountain there is a bridge called Yamasuge-no-hashi with profound mystical significance. Details can be found in the origin records. This is not something that should be openly recorded."

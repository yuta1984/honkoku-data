It was said to have a thousand households, and due to the profits from copper and silver mines, people gathered from various provinces, creating prosperity. However, from the end of the Enkyō and Kan'en eras (around 1748), it gradually declined, and now has only about three hundred households.

The village dwellings are in mountainous terrain, so the villagers built their homes at the foot of the mountains. Two roads run north and south. The area extends about three ri east-west and one ri north-south. The fourteen villages are: Matō, Akakura, Kyūzō, Matsuki, Nitamoto, Takaharagi, and Mikouchi - these villages are called the upper division. Kakemizu, Akazawa, Shinnashi, Nakai, Tōshita, Hara, and Karafuro - these villages are called the lower division. From this place, there is a post station that produces copper, two ri to Jōshū.

Origins of the Copper Mine: In ancient times, there were a hundred mine shafts. The topography of this copper mine is a mountain in the center of Ashio Village, and Ashio's four boundaries extend about five to six ri. The copper mine's circumference spans approximately three ri and eighteen chō, and the copper mine consists of rock formations with no trees growing on the mountain peak. The copper mine began being excavated in Keichō 15 (1610), when people from Bizen Province came to this area and determined it was a copper mine. Since it was then the territory of Zazen-in Temple, they obtained permission and began digging, discovering abundant copper.

They extracted it and presented trial-smelted copper to the government authorities. At that time, it coincided with the third Shogun's first wearing of formal hakama trousers for celebration, so it was considered an auspicious copper mine. From then on, it became a government mountain, and while tribute matters were under Nikkō's jurisdiction, the copper mine came under the magistrate's command, with successive generations managing it. During the Kyōhō period (1716-1736), borrowed money and government loans frequently reached enormous amounts. Also, in early Genbun (around 1736), in addition to government copper, they were ordered to establish a coin-minting facility and briefly produced coins. The coins with the character "Ashi" (足) on the back were minted here. Subsequently, government funding ceased, it became contract smelting, and from then the copper mine declined. They petitioned for exemption from the coin-minting facility and nearly fell into poverty. However, even now, copper contract smelting remains under the magistrate's jurisdiction, with a garrison office and resident deputies as before. The person from Bizen who discovered this copper mine made great wealth and, when about to return to his home province, erected a stone monument in the grounds of Daien-ji Temple, a Jōdo sect temple in Shinnashi Village, inscribing the history of the mine's development. However, now the temple is abandoned and deteriorated, and the stone monument has also deteriorated with the characters

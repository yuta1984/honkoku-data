　One hundred and eighty trays of sacred food are offered to the Gongen Prince, and the resident monks maintain the proper order in conducting these services as an established practice, never allowing it to fall into decline.

From this temple to the mountain peak, 240 chō constitute the sacred boundary (kekkai). The five types of phases and four guardian deities are complete. At the front is a great lake that raises waves of five colors like the Pool of Eight Merits. On the southern shore of the lake is a separate place called Utahama, which is a site of miraculous power of Maitreya Bodhisattva and Myōkichijō-ten. In the southwest of the lake stands a Buddhist temple called Nichirin-ji, where statues of Fudō Myōō, Gōzanze Myōō, Gundari Myōō, Daiitoku Myōō, Kongō Yasha Myōō and other honored deities are enshrined.

As for the nature of this land: the sacred peaks stretch magnificently, sending forth a thousand ridges standing tall, and the sacred lake extends vastly, reflecting the four quarters of darkness and circling far into the distance. All the majesty of its steep heights and the beauty of its supreme excellence are contained in Kōbō Daishi's composition "Preface to the Stele Inscription on Shōdō's Journey Through Mountains and Waters." The present record roughly presents only the main points. At this time, on the third day of the first month of Hōen 7 (1141), Court Councillor Fujiwara no Atsumitsu made this firm record to leave for future generations.

Musha Festival: Every year on the fourth day of the first month, as the Shinto ritual of the Musha Festival, one shrine family member of the imperial shrine, who also serves as shrine administrator, climbs the mountain and performs the ceremony at the lakeside as an ancient archery ritual. When people from Nikkō town or nearby villages climb the mountain and shoot whistling arrows, all the pilgrims, young and old, raise their voices together. This is said to be a ritual from ancient times.

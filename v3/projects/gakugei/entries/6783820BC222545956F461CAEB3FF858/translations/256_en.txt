　Proceeding along the new road route to arrive before the Shingū worship hall, completing the ritual prayers before the portable shrines, and
　stopping the palanquin in that vicinity to oversee the proceedings. At a place where a dance stage was constructed on the south side of the Sanbutsu Hall,
　the two monks dance alternately, and from the middle part one wears a black standing court cap and performs the dance.
　The assembled monks chant dance songs behind the stage. 《On March 2nd, one sacred horse is｜led to the front of this stage and stationed in the wide courtyard, but at the April festival》
　《this does｜not occur》. The festival magistrate and others sit in formal position. Soon the dance ends, and
　His Eminence the Gate Master turns his palanquin around, while the dancers and other monks likewise follow behind
　and return to the main temple. After a short while, when the four o'clock bell is struck, the divine ritual soon begins.
《Sacred Sakaki for Welcoming the Deities》
　In ordinary divine festivals, sakaki branches are drawn forward at the beginning of the ritual, but in this mountain's divine ritual
　it differs from that. As soon as the four o'clock bell is struck, from the direction of the temporary shrine, those in white robes
　numbering about three hundred, with one hundred fifty guards in hemp formal dress, raise their voices in unison and draw them before the viewing
　pavilion into the stone torii gate area. Thus they bring forth the attendants for the divine ritual.

　For this reason it is called the true sakaki for welcoming the deities. What is called sakaki used in other divine rituals
　are winter trees resembling《shiinoki (chinquapin oak)》with small leaves. The sakaki of this divine festival
　are summer trees with trunk, branches and leaves all like《sala trees》. In the local dialect they are called
　Saruname. These are the responsibility of Kujira village, and every year twice they are dug up from the mountain forest subdivision
　called Ezura in that area. Also, regarding sakaki being drawn forward first in ordinary divine rituals,
　the tradition explains this as the origin of calling them "true sakaki," but this may be folk
　explanation. The characters for "sakaki" appear in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. In the Man'yōshū it is
　written as《divine tree》, but in later ages it came to be written as "sacred tree," meaning trees used in divine rituals,
　and later the two characters were combined into one character, finally coming to use the character "sakaki."
《Music for Procession and Return》
　For the procession, Keiun-gaku music is performed, and for the return, Kanjō-gaku music is performed.

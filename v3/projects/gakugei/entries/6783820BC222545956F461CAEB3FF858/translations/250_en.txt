After making this offering, the Azuma-asobi (Eastern Dance) is performed with song and dance. Among the attendants, one person chants Kagura songs, while the other two play the hichiriki (double-reed wind instrument) and the komaibue (Korean flute). When the dance music ends, the removal of the sacred meal is called "sagari-gozen," and it is said that at this time the court musicians also perform "Ryōō" (Prince Lanling).

According to the Shoku Shūi, when Shikibu no Taifu Sukenari served as Iyo no Kami (Governor of Iyo), the monk-poet Nōin composed this poem about the Azuma-asobi offered at Mishima Myōjin shrine in that province:
"At Utsu Beach, the celestial robe came in ancient times - are those sleeves that once waved the same as today's dancers?"
Though this may not have been as elaborate as our sacred festival here, it was likely a dance offered before the shrine. The sacred rituals of our mountain, with their splendid decorations of silk brocades and embroideries, are most auspicious sacred festivals that are as eternal as the heavens and incomparably magnificent divine affairs.

Annual Festivals of Mount Nikko
For the Tōshōgū festival, court musicians from the capital came to perform Azuma-asobi Kagura, but this practice was later discontinued and not performed for a long time.
His Imperial Highness the First Prince wished to revive this ceremony, and in the autumn of Hōei 3 (1706), he petitioned Shogun Tsunayoshi.
The Shogun quickly granted the request and summoned the musicians Settsu no Kami Takutomi, Hōki no Kami Koma Chikaiie, Bunzen no Kami Koma Chikatō, Mokuryo Gon no Kami Koma Chikanari, and Sakon Shōgen Koma Nagasada to transmit these musical pieces to the Nikko musicians. In the fourth month of the fourth year, a stipend of 300 hyō of rice was allocated to cover expenses, and from then on, it became customary to perform this music at every festival in the fourth and ninth months. Yasutaka, receiving orders from His Imperial Highness, respectfully records this history and has it carved in stone.

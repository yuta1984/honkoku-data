　　The high-shining light is softened here, and the divine dwelling place is unclouded by even a speck of dust
　　The mountain princess Asahiko of Mount Futarasan leaves her reflection on the white snow of the peaks
　　The dragon that once came from the cloud realm now again appears to people at the Yamaga Bridge
　　Through countless ages, adding to the numbers of the riverside fields, may we meet again at the cedars of your sacred presence
　　Does the bustling smoke rise higher here than the hearth fires of the people in the eight islands of Muro
　　As far as the eye can see in the distance, the summer grasses of the Nasu plains merge with the sky
　　In the nine-fold palace, at the well with the same name as the beach, cloud-dwelling nobles lodge at Kurodo
　　How is it that the water of Takino'o falls from the mountain of black hair without black streaks
　　Know this reverence: even the grass leaves that bend in the high pine wind that we look up to reach to other lands

This is called the "ascending meal," and at this time Jittenraku is

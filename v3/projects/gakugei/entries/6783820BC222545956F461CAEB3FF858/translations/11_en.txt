all are ancient sites without exception. If one were to inquire into every detail and seek out every trace, it would not only vainly increase the number of pages and become tediously verbose and disagreeable, but would conversely also diminish the convenience of scenic exploration. This is certainly not my intention. This present book merely takes up those things that touch the ordinary person's eyes and ears to form its compilation. If gentlemen with refined interests and elegant guests who love antiquity wish to learn more, they should take up their walking sticks, inquire of mountain guides, and then afterward come to know the details.

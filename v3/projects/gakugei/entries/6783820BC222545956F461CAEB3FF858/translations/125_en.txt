The place where seri (water dropwort) grows is called Toya (bird house). Now, the area around this Kindan-ishi (forbidden stone) is the Zenchō-dō, a path where Buddhist monks perform mountain ascetic practices. From here, climbing northwest up Ozasa-yama to its peak, one can view the cascading waters of Nanataki (Seven Falls) nearby.

Nanataki (Seven Falls)　These seven falls are the source of the Inari River. However, following the river, there are many giant rocks and thorns blocking the path, and with deep mountains and steep valleys, it is difficult to reach the vicinity of the falls. The deeper one ventures into the valley, the more one loses sight of the falls' location. Therefore, if one climbs the path of Sesshō-seki (Killing Stone), the entire area consists of barren mountains. Climbing about one and a half ri along mountain paths through small bamboo grass plains, with views opening in all directions and a distant prospect of ten ri to the east. This is a continuation of Nyobō-san (Lady Mountain). Climbing to the peak and looking down, one sees sheer cliffs as if carved and chiseled. Here, to the north lie the seven falls, where water cascades from seven locations with a force of approximately ten jō, or perhaps fourteen to fifteen jō, though the bottom is shrouded in billowing water spray that cannot be measured. Presently, clouds and mist swirl up, and while watching, the falls disappear from view again. This area is not a realm easily reached. However, during the Kanbun era, during a period of continuous rain, suddenly

there was a flood, and raging waves like mountains crashed down into the Inari River, causing several houses to be swept away and many people to drown. Afterwards, the area became a riverbed. The local people传说 that the mountain collapsed in previous years and the Seven Falls appeared, but this is a false theory. According to the ancient temple records of our mountain, the Seven Falls have existed since ancient times and continue to serve as a place of worship for Zenchō practitioners to this day.

The Creeping Pine of Nyohō-zan　This is a five-needle pine called Hime-komatsu (Princess Pine). Many grow in the mountains. This one is located on the north back side of Nyohō-zan. It creeps continuously for about eight chō from the mountaintop, extending south over three valleys and north over seven valleys, with its root stock's location unknown. Being one tree that creeps and spans in this manner, it can truly be called a famous tree. It serves as a path where ascetic practitioners performing peak training cross over the pine's branches for Zenchō practice. It is an unprecedented long pine. Though this area is not a place for ordinary people to visit and observe, it is a place constantly spoken of and传承 by monks who have practiced asceticism and those who make their living gathering medicinal plants.

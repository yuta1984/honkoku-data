surely prevail. If the Jizō loses to a dog, then even if called a miraculous buddha, there would be nothing to that claim. Let us test this and make it entertainment for our drinking. Hurry!" So commanded, his retainers immediately brought the sacred image down from the hall, tied it to the dog, and threw them into the lake water. The dog, startled by the commotion, raised its head and pulled the image about four or five chō across the lake surface. The shōgen and his retainers clapped their hands and laughed, crying out in unison, "Look! The Jizō is being pulled by the dog!" and laughed loudly.

Miraculously, this sacred image suddenly righted itself in the water, pulled the dog back, and brought it to the original shore. When the shōgen stepped forward to push it out into the lake again, suddenly clouds and mist arose in all directions so that they could not see before them. The shōgen and his retainers' bodies became paralyzed and they could not move, vomiting blood or fainting. At that time, some woodcutters who were in the area saw this state and, filled with fear, hurried to report to the Chūzen-ji branch temple. The monks who were present rushed over, first retrieved the sacred image from the lake water, and untied the dog, whereupon the dog immediately collapsed.

It is truly a sacred image of unparalleled miraculous power. Details can be found in the origin story.

Kindan-ishi (Prohibition Stone): The local people call it Kindan-ishi, or sometimes chant it as Sesshō-seki (Killing Stone). These are all abbreviated terms. In reality, it is a boundary marker for the prohibition of killing. It stands twenty chō behind the mountain, northwest of Takino-o and Midō-yama. Beyond this point, killing is not problematic, so about ten chō up the mountain from this marker, hunters hunt wild boar and deer, or establish what they call "bird huts," hiding there. In autumn, to catch birds coming out from the mountains, they gather tree branches in certain areas, spread bird lime on them, and catch birds that try to rest there. In spring too, from around the fourth month when entering the mountains, they also catch birds as a means of livelihood.

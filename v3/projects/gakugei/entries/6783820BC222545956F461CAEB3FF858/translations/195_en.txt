Those who have seen the water are rare. From the sacred mountain precinct to Kuriyama Village is six ri of mountain path, and from places within Kuriyama Village called Yunishi or Kawamata to this Kinu Marsh is said to be another six ri of mountain path. Together it is twelve ri of mountain paths, and particularly because it is a place where human habitation has ceased, no one goes there for sightseeing. They only speak of what has been transmitted from ancient times. However, it can be seen from afar from the peaks of Mount Nantai, Mount Taro, or Mount Oku-Shirane. Its direction corresponds to the north back side of Mount Nantai. Its size is approximately one ri square. The Daishi's Kibun states: "Looking north there is a lake of approximately one hundred qing, narrow from east to west, long from north to south." It also says: "Viewing the northern lake, it is about thirty ri from the southern lake." The marsh lake is pure, with sacred grasses and rare trees lining the lake shore, pine and cypress branches hanging down. The marsh bottom is not deep, and the sand and stones are all five-colored, so the clear water naturally appears in five colors. The scenery is like brocade flowers in bloom, as if weaving on a loom. The flowers of the four seasons never cease, and it could truly be called a hermit's realm. All the trees bend and twist upon the rocks, creating a naturally curved and folded landscape. Therefore it was called Nishiki Marsh (Brocade Marsh), but now it is called Kinu Marsh (Silk Marsh). The water flows and falls in three directions, reaching even Aizu, and one stream flows into the mountains of Kozuke Province.

It flows into the mountains and is said to be a source of the Tone River. Since ancient times, no one has definitively traced the waterway. People know that what flows through this province and enters Hitachi and Shimosa is called the Kinu River. Also, this marsh lake was originally one lake in ancient times, but at some point it split and became twelve lakes, and downstream they gradually converge to become the Kinu River.

Yu Lake: This is at Yumoto, approximately fourteen to fifteen cho by twenty cho in size.

Chuzenji Hot Springs - Eight Springs: Located northwest of Chuzenji Bessho, passing through Akanuma Plain to Yumoto is three ri, and six ri from Nikko's Sacred Bridge. Even in spring the wind, snow, and cold are severe, with lingering cold until the end of March, so starting from April 8th people climb the mountain and each opens their hot spring bathhouses. However, Mount Shirane still has much remaining snow, so few people bathe until late May to June. In September snow falls on the front mountains, so September 8th marks the end when they close the bathhouses and descend to the foot of the mountain. This is managed by people from Nikko town. Opening the bathhouses daily...

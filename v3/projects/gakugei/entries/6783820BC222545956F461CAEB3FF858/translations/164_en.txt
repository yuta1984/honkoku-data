Inscription on the Ancient Bell
　This ancient bell was damaged in the fire of Bunka 8 (1811), so in the following ninth year, when a new bell was cast by imperial command, this old inscription was included and inscribed with the name of Former Great Monk Supervisor Ryōun, monk Shōsen. The inscription text is abbreviated here.

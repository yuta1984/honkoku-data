《Evening Preparation Ritual》
　April 16th Evening at the seventh hour
　His Eminence the Gate Master ascends to the shrine and descends, whereupon
　the portable shrines of the three shrines of Tōshōgū are transferred from the main shrine to the worship hall of Shingū《Nikkō Gongen》
　Shrine families and court musicians prepare their ceremonial attire, while others participating in the divine ritual arrange the festival implements,
　attending the portable shrines. The Nikkō Magistrates, both group leaders, and other various officials provide strict
　security as the shrines are transferred. This is called the Evening Preparation Ritual. The following
　17th day, the shrines are transferred from this worship hall to the temporary shrine.
　　《For the return procession, the portable shrines go directly back into the main shrine grounds. After the return of the portable shrines, when the three shrines are stored in the shrine house,｜the musicians perform Taiheigaku music in front of the building》

Ennen Dance　《This dance is the same ceremony performed annually on March 2nd at the Shingū festival》
　This is performed annually before the festival on April 17th. These three portable shrines remain
　in the Shingū worship hall from the previous night. Two monks - these are
among the temple community of the entire mountain, appointed
　monks who perform this, and ancient precedent is heard. Indeed, this dance is said to be
　a secret dance for peace under heaven and abundant harvests in the land. It is said that when Great Master Jikaku entered Tang China, he brought back
　this dance for peace under heaven. Now, on the morning of the festival day《around the fifth hour》before
　the mentioned two monks wrap their heads with white five-stripe kesas, wearing scarlet silk brocade hitatare robes with peony and Chinese
　grass patterns, white ōkuchi hakama trousers, and short swords with unwrapped shark-skin handles and exposed
　eyes, also without tsuba guards, in nashiji-lacquered sheaths inserted behind them, tied with crimson cords,
　wearing tall-nosed shoes, the two monks emerge in procession from the main temple. Additionally, attending monks
　follow, with several dozen servants in white robes attending, and next
　His Eminence the Gate Master likewise departs in a palanquin, entering through the stone torii gate

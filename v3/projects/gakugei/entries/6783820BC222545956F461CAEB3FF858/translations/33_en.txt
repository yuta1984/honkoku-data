Climbing along the rocks that wind in nine zigzag turns, the temple appears deeply moving, with pines and cedars mingling with clouds and mist, and the peaks of the maki-cypress plains stretching layer upon layer. Large rivers flow from the valleys on both sides, and at the point where they converge, there is a bridge extending from the tip of the rocks. Its length must be more than forty jō. It appears to span through the air without any supporting pillars. It has been called Yamasuge Bridge since ancient times. Since the Man'yōshū mentions that kosuge (small sedge) grows on this mountain, it appears to be a name with historical significance. Around sunset that day, we arrived at the lodging temple Kyōsen-bō. The following day, there was a renga poetry session at Zazen-in.

It ended at night. The scribe appeared to be a young acolyte of about sixteen or seventeen years old, and the day-long entertainment of the gathering was quite substantial. A sarugaku performer named Miyamasu Genzō and others had also come up the mountain, and they spent cups of sake repeatedly until late at night, singing and dancing in such an amusing manner that everyone could not help but wish it would last a thousand years. The next day, after worshipping at Nikkō-dō Gongen, there is a separate temple called Takino-o. There is a Fudō Hall at the base of the waterfall, and above the waterfall there is a tower gate.

The path from the temple is about twenty-odd chō, with large stones laid like tatami mats, and all the temple paths are paved with stones and smooth. Looking down at the valleys from here, there appear to be about five hundred or more temple halls and monks' quarters. There is a place called Chūzen-ji with a lake forty ri above. In ancient times, the provincial governor of this province, Tachibana no Toshitōo, following imperial orders, established it at Itabashi in the third year of Daidō, and after the passage of about eight hundred and some years since then, after the enshrinement of the Great Divine Ancestor, repairs were made in the sixth year of Kan'ei (1629), and in the thirteenth year (1636) the newly constructed structure was fourteen ken long and three ken wide, with railings on all sides painted in vermillion lacquer, with gilt bronze ornamental tops, and all other handrails and metal fittings the same. The bridge's backing boards and crossbeams are painted black, with barrier rails set at both entrances and golden chains prohibiting passage. Large stones on both banks are carved to form pillars—eternal stone pillars that will not change for ten thousand generations. In April of the same year, for the twenty-first memorial service of Tōshō-gū, noble families and temple abbots from Kyoto, as well as other court nobles came down...

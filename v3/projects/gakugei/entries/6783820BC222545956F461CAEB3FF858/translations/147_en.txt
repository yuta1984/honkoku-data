The bottom has a road width of about four shaku, and a height of six to seven shaku, so there is no hindrance to passing through behind the waterfall.
It is truly a rare flying waterfall. The reason such a famous scenic waterfall was not included in the Eight Views was probably
because the name "urami" (resentment) was disliked.

Kiyotaki Village: About one ri from the Shinkyo Bridge area. The entrance here is called Toriihara,
which must be the site where the torii of Kiyotaki Gongen once stood. This is the route to Chuzenji and the Ashio area.
Thirty households are scattered about, and there are also dry fields.

Kiyotaki Gongen: Located beside the village road. This shrine has been enshrined since ancient times.
Investigating its origins, during Emperor Tenmu's Taiho era, two people, En no Shōkaku and Unpen Shōnin,
arrived at Kiyotaki of Mount Daiju, where clouds arose above the falls, thunder roared, and rain poured down like cart axles, making progress
difficult. When the two prayed using secret incantations and mystical words, the sky suddenly cleared. At that
place was a great cedar, and above it appeared tengu chieftains leading tens of thousands of followers,
who told the two: "We received Buddha's entrustment at Mount Ryōzen two thousand years ago and became great demon kings,

ruling this mountain and benefiting all living beings." Having finished speaking, they disappeared. Due to this, the two people
honored the cedar trees as Kiyotaki Shisho Myōjin, and also enshrined Senju Daishi by the waterfall to
pacify the land. Since it became a sacred area for protecting Buddhism in later generations, Kōbō Daishi
enshrined this deity for protection and also established Kiyotaki-ji Temple. For this reason, Kiyotaki Gongen is enshrined
as a sacred site of esoteric Buddhism and serves as the guardian deity of the mountain. Ancient cedars grow thick, and steep
rocks soar dozens of jō high, where there is a waterfall. This was named Kiyotaki.

Kiyotaki-ji Temple: Called Shōfukuzan Kongō Jōju-in. In ancient times it was a Shingon practice hall. Originally
founded by Kōbō Daishi, later when Jikaku Daishi climbed the mountain, all the monks of the mountain became
followers of the Tendai school's dharma lineage. This temple also changed its sect from that time. It was originally the bodhi temple of the entire mountain.
In Kan'ei 5, when Jigen Daishi founded Myōdō-in, the dharma water of Kiyotaki-ji was transferred
and the ordination chamber was established, as recorded in old records. It is an affiliated temple of Myōdō-in.

Kiyotaki Kannon Hall and Temple Administration: Called Chōkōzan Fukuju-in Entrū-ji. Adjacent to the Kannon Hall

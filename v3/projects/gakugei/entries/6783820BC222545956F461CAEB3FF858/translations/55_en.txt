Sanbutsudō (Three Buddha Hall): Located north of the Shingū Torii, this is what was called Kondō (Golden Hall) in ancient times. It is the great hall within the mountain compound,
with copper roofing and red lacquer finish, 18 ken across the front and 14-15 ken deep. It enshrines the honji-butsu (original Buddha forms) of the Nikkō Three Shrines.
In the hall, Senju Kannon is the honji of Shingū. Batō Kannon is the honji of Hongū, each being seated statues of 8 shaku
5 sun. Amida is the honji of Takino-o, approximately 9 shaku 5 sun in height. These are the sacred statues that Jikaku Daishi carved when he climbed this mountain
and established the temple. In the northwest corner of this hall is enshrined a wooden statue of Shōdō Shōnin, and in the northeast direction is also placed a wooden statue of Gundari Myōō.

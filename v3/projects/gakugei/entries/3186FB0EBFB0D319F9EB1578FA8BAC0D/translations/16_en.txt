○Swordsmanship is the technique of sword fighting. It is also called "heihōja" (military strategist) and is the foremost way of the warrior. There are many schools: Shintō-ryū, Yagyū-ryū, Shinkage-ryū, Ittō-ryū, and various others. However, there are often many people who rely on immature skills and do not know the danger to their lives. Is this not lamentable? In today's peaceful reign, it would be better for merchants, artisans, farmers and such not to know these arts.

○Go is said to have been created by the Duke of Zhou (Zhougong Dan). It is said to have been transmitted when Minister Kibi visited Tang China. The 360 intersections represent the days of the year. The nine star points represent the nine luminaries, and the black and white stones represent day and night.
○Shogi was created when Emperor Wu of Zhou commanded his retainer Wang Bao to make it. It models military formations and tactics. There are large shogi and medium shogi; what we play with today is called small shogi, which comes from ancient custom.

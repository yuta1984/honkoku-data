such value indeed. From the Kanbun era until now, nearly one hundred and several decades have passed, and the printing blocks have already become worn and damaged. This year, in the Kansei Kitsunoto year, the master of the Nukada family commissioned the Shimokawabe family to copy the old format and re-engrave it. The precise and meticulous workmanship is twice as fine as the original. After completion, I was asked to provide a few words, so I stated the following: Recently, there has been Shunchōsai's "Yamashiro Meisho Zue" (Illustrated Guide to Famous Places in Yamashiro), which has also flourished in the world due to its illustrations. Printed in the morning and evening, the paper of Luoyang has become precious. That work is actually nothing more than an armchair travel companion, yet it is still praised in this manner. How much more so for this greatly beneficial book, which does not serve merely to delight the eye. It will surely run alongside that work and surpass it, as clear as pointing to one's palm. I offer congratulations in advance for Elder Nukada. Elder, record this and verify it.

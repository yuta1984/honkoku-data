○Tennin (celestial beings) have flower ornaments on their heads that never wither, their feathered robes never become soiled, and they never blink. However, when their lives end, their pleasures are exhausted and they experience the sadness of the five signs of decay.

○Karyōbinga is a celestial bird. It has a face like that of a celestial being, and its voice is exceptionally beautiful, so it is also called the "Bird of Wondrous Voice" or "Bird of Good Sound." This is according to Buddhist teachings.

○Waka is a custom of this country, where thirty-one syllables of kana are strung together, using the heart as seed to express emotions based on truth. Therefore, poetry has such virtue that even buddhas and gods respond to it. Although waka is said to have begun in the age of the gods, we revere Sumiyoshi Daimyōjin as the deity of poetry, and regard Sotōori-hime, Hitomaro, and Akahito as the ancestral deities of poetry. Later, there were many poets like Shunzei, Teika, and Karyū, who composed numerous excellent poems.

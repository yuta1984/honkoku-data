○Poetry originated in China, so it is called "Chinese poetry" (karauta). Poetry, like waka, has six principles. There are five-character and seven-character forms, composed of five or seven characters respectively, with regulated verse (zekku) and regulated poetry (ritsu). The ability to express emotions well, move human hearts, and reveal truth is limited to these two forms of poetry and song.

All of them left their reputations in the way of the brush for posterity, and their handwriting is revered. Prince Son'en's calligraphy is called the "Imperial House School," and it is still studied and used today.

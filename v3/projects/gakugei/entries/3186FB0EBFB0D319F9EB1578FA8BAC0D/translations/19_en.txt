○Noh theater has existed since ancient times, but its transmission is not certain. During the reign of Emperor Go-Komatsu, a person called Kan'ami Zeami served as a noh master for the shogun's family and performed vigorously. Later it split into the four schools of Konparu, Hōshō, and Kongō. The term "sarugaku" is said to derive from the lineage of Sarutahiko. Utai (noh chanting) is the premier performing art of Japan, encompassing everything from Shinto, Buddhism, love, impermanence, historical tales, to common proverbs.

○The flute, kotsuzumi (small drum), ōtsuzumi (large drum), and taiko (drum) are called the four rhythmic instruments. The flute was created by Qiu Zhong during the time of Emperor Wu of Han. The drum was created by King Mu of Qin. The large drum represents yang and the ryo mode, while the small drum represents yin and the ritsu mode. These are instruments of yin-yang harmony. The taiko drum was made from the skin of a beast called Kui that was killed during the time of the Yellow Emperor. Alternatively, it is said that when the Yellow Emperor fought against Chi You, the Dark Lady created a drum from Kui cattle for the emperor.

○Puppet theater is also called "ayatsuri" (manipulation). Initially, puppets were operated by suspending them with strings, but skilled practitioners emerged and now they can move freely as if they were alive. The art is based on the two theaters, Takemoto-za and Toyotake-za in Naniwa (Osaka), with many skilled puppeteers. Also in Naniwa, there is the Takeda theater featuring mechanical puppets with such remarkable craftsmanship that it amazes spectators.

○Acrobatics has had its tradition since ancient times, though its origins are unknown. Indeed, it involves dangerous performances, but through balance and skilled training, many experts have emerged to delight people's eyes. However, there are those who sometimes suffer injuries or accidents. Since someone called Kirin-dayū began walking on a single rope, all acrobats have come to be called "kirin" by the general public. It would be difficult to master without familiarizing oneself with it from childhood.

As mentioned before, by the same principle that roads dry after rain and pond water disappears during droughts, water vapor rises day and night from seas, rivers, and land without ever ceasing. When this water vapor rises into the air and encounters cold, it condenses to form clouds and mist, as explained in the previous section about clouds. When these clouds encounter even greater cold, they immediately solidify and return to their original water form.

In this way, when it becomes water, its weight increases, so it naturally falls downward. This is precisely what rain is. Because it rises from below and then falls, and falls and then rises again, since the age of the gods in ancient times, the water in seas and rivers has neither increased nor decreased. However, if it only fell without rising, the water in seas and rivers would immediately increase and overflow onto the land. The fact that there is little water in midsummer and much rain during the rainy season is merely due to temporary imbalances in the rising and falling, but truly in the universe

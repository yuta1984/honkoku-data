When you fan the fire, the flames become vigorous because more oxygen is being supplied.
Sixth: Friction heat refers to when two objects strike against each other or rub together, generating heat and producing fire. For example, flint producing sparks, or when stones are struck together and fire emerges - this follows exactly this principle. Also, when objects rub against each other, they generate heat, and when two pieces of ice are rubbed together, the ice melts precisely because heat is generated.

Now, heat has the property of equalizing mutually to achieve the same temperature, so when a hot object and a cold object come into contact, the heat from the hot object is transmitted to the cold object, equalizing to create a uniform temperature. However, there are materials that conduct this heat quickly and others that conduct it slowly. Metals conduct heat rapidly, while plants, fur, and cotton conduct it slowly. For example, when the tip of fire tongs is heated in a fire, even the handle you're holding becomes hot, but with wood, even when the tip is burning, the handle does not become hot.

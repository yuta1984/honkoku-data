Songs of the Five Constants
　　Showing mercy to others and forgetting oneself,
Benevolence　being compassionate in all things—
　　know such a person as benevolent
　　Without flattery or arrogance,
Righteousness　without争ing or being attached to desire,
　　cherish moral duty
　　Revering one's lord and caring for retainers,
Propriety　even in trivial matters, regardless of high or low status,
　　do not disturb proper etiquette
　　In all matters, seeking to understand their true nature,
Wisdom　widely seek out knowledgeable people and
　　do not slander others
　　Praying that one's heart be very honest,
Trustworthiness　continue to abandon evil and
　　make good your companion

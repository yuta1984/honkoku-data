Zhu Wengong said (Zhu Xi, given name Xi, courtesy name Yuanhui, also Zhonghui. He was a great Confucian scholar of the Song Dynasty. Wengong was his posthumous title):

"Do not say that if you do not study today, there will be tomorrow. Do not say that if you do not study this year, there will be next year. Days and months pass away, years do not extend for us. Alas, whose fault is this?"

This passage is from Zhu Xi's kind encouragement for people to pursue learning. Those who aspire to learning should advance quickly on the path and not neglect even a single day. Thinking "I won't study today, but I'll study starting tomorrow" and neglecting today, or saying "I won't study this year, but I'll study starting next year" and being lazy - while doing so, days and months quickly pass, years do not extend, years do not return, and we grow old in vain, feeling sad and regretful, but it's too late. Whose fault is this? It's not something others knew about - it's one's own fault for thinking there would be tomorrow and next year and being negligent. Since regretting now is useless, everyone should learn the Way in childhood and youth, treasuring today and striving without negligence - this is what he teaches us. Young people should strive and learn daily.

🎵 Do not let thoughts of tomorrow chirp in your heart - learn today as if it matters most, people of the world

Accumulating wealth can only be accomplished by greatly going against the Way, so its inevitable loss is like floating clouds—not something one should rely upon or trust.
Therefore, one should simply have descendants quickly apprenticed to teachers to learn the teachings of the sages, and have them learn the Way of cultivating oneself and governing others.
When one truly understands and enjoys this existence as a human being, even if one's destiny is unfortunate and one's circumstances become poor, the purity of heart with simple food for a while would be far more enjoyable than the insatiable greed of those who accumulate thousands of gold pieces, or the daily waste of vast sums on luxurious feasts by such contemptible people.

○When I carefully consider the hearts of people in this world, generally everyone has some aspiration to learn the Way that makes humans truly human, but both ourselves and others are too busy with the affairs of making our way through the world. While hesitating and remaining silent, spring and autumn pass, we grow old, and naturally fail to achieve our original intentions. There should be no parent who does not think, "At least let me be above ordinary people, and let my child also be called a true person by others." However, despite thinking this way, they do not quickly apprentice their children to teachers for education. They idly let yesterday pass and today end, ultimately never finding the day to provide learning. Moreover, drowning in affectionate love, they raise children permissively from infancy according to their whims. Even when the children reach a vigorous age, since they do not know the Way of being filial to parents, they are constantly only unfilial. As a result, even though they are one's own children, parents grit their teeth in hatred and reproach them, complain to others, and ultimately there are cases in the world of severing the parent-child bond, which is painful to hear about.

There are very many such cases. Of course, while the child's unfilial behavior is truly the height of what should be detested, the fault of not having them learn and not teaching the Way by which they should have been filial originally lies with the parents. In the Analects, it is said, "To lead an untaught people to war is to abandon them." Therefore, those who are parents should first strictly discipline themselves and teach children the Way from their tender years—this is truly the duty and loving-kindness of being a parent. Also, children should learn the Way without disobeying their parents' instructions and practice filial care. Regardless of good or bad, without finding fault with one's parents, even if one's father and mother treat one harshly, one should simply fulfill the Way of the child and practice filial piety toward one's parents as one's duty and filial obligation, serving them without seeing any fault in one's parents. However, among the children in this world, there are some who commit unfilial and improper acts and say, "This is the fault of my parents not properly teaching and raising me from my tender years."

Those who try to escape blame and wrongdoing by speaking ill of their parents in this way are truly great villains far worse than birds and beasts, and it is defiling to speak of them and foolish to put it into words. Children should never find fault with their parents' good or bad points, but should diligently fulfill their role of filial piety. When they do so, even without praying, the gods and buddhas will protect them, the family will prosper and flourish, and descendants will likewise flourish in this manner. Those who are parents should not be drowned in love for their children, but should somehow guide them to the good Way. From their tender years, they should have them follow good teachers, associate with good friends, learn to observe good things, and learn to hear good things, making their children into good people who cultivate themselves well and preserve their families well. This is the great filial piety of ancestors and parents, and should be called the great compassionate heart of cherishing descendants.

Min Shi was virtuous and benevolent - how could he ever resent his stepmother? (Stepmother refers to a second wife)
By keeping the mother before his honorable father so that the three children could remain, they were spared from hardship and suffering.

People who are children in this world should follow the virtue of this Min Ziqian, strive in filial piety, and deepen their sincerity. Then not only their birth parents, but even stepfathers and stepmothers - how could they keep their hearts distant? When people treat me badly, it is because my own sincerity is lacking. Understanding this, one should not blame others, but simply reflect upon oneself and devote filial devotion to parents and sincerity to people.

Though she may act like a stepmother
　　and not be a true mother
A child should follow
　　the path of being a true child

If it were the case that I am good
　　while others are bad,
　　　　that would be one thing
But when others are bad,
　　it is because I am bad

Good and bad do not lie in others
　　but in myself
If you straighten the form,
　　the shadow will not be crooked

Though there is truly nothing
　　to feel sorry about toward others,
The mind that thinks there are barriers
　　　　becomes the fence itself

Preface to Buikuso (Child-Rearing Grass)
My friend, Master Gido Wakisaka, studied learning in our Ishida school and, arising with great compassionate heart, wished to benefit people. He previously authored several books in vernacular script (hiragana and katakana), using humor to provide moral instruction. Now he has again written this volume "Buikuso" to teach and guide young children.
Indeed, when guiding people, if done during their childhood, it enters easily into their hearts, but becomes difficult (if attempted later in life).

Children's Instructions　Twenty-Eight Verses

People should simply learn good things from early childhood
　and choose their friends accordingly
Give proper responses to parents, behave well
　apply yourself to calligraphy and abacus, and to reading
Morning and evening, worship gods and Buddha
　then with your heart, bow to your parents
Since falsehood is the root of all evil
　even casually, do not tell lies
Boastful talk, self-praise, gossip, and slanderous speech
　meddling advice, harsh words, interfering speech—avoid these

It is better not to engage in fighting, quarrels, throwing stones
　wrestling, dangerous play, rough horseplay
Things you would hide and do secretly
　without being told by teachers or parents—never do such things
Taking life immediately brings retribution upon oneself
　Do not take the lives of living beings, children
Do not laugh at the mentally ill or physically disabled
　People will laugh at the fool who laughs at them
Since the heart is moved by circumstances
　do not engage in wicked play
Apply moxa every month; if you apply moxa
　parents will rejoice and you will be safe

Apprentice Instructions　Twenty-Eight Verses

Never forget the spirit of the day you came to serve
　and serve with dedication always
When your master gives orders, immediately
　respond well and carry out your duties
Do not misspeak when delivering messages; when on errands
　do not dawdle or waste time
Do not fight, do not wrestle, do not
　bully other children, and do not retaliate
Tell no lies, be consistent in public and private, be observant
　spare no effort and work your body hard

Boastful talk, flattering women, and acting presumptuously
　these are the beginning of one's downfall
Competitive games and river play
　handling small money, eating in secret—avoid these
Do not spend precious nights dozing
　stay alert and apply yourself to calligraphy and abacus
Graffiti, dog fighting, playing with ditches
　forgetting errands and dropping things
Do not speak up every time you serve; be gentle
　do not quarrel with maidservants or spoil relationships
Do not speak outside about your master's household affairs
　speak of neither good nor bad, tell nothing

The Five Relationships

【Lower Left Page】
The Five Relationships are the five paths of ruler-minister, father-child, husband-wife, brothers, and friends. Between father and child, since they share flesh and blood, there is reason for mutual affection. Between ruler and minister, though they are strangers, the ruler provides stipend and nurture while the minister dedicates his life in service—there is reason for them to interact through righteousness. Husband and wife easily become familiar with each other, so there is reason to properly distinguish between male and female proprieties. Among brothers, there is an order of respecting the elder and showing compassion for the younger. Friends should interact with sincerity so their words remain consistent. In the space between heaven and earth, there are no other paths for humans to follow beyond these five. Making clear the path of the Five Relationships is called the path of being truly human. If one goes against these five paths, though one's form may be human, one's heart will be no different from birds and beasts.

Benevolence: Know that those who benefit others while forgetting themselves and show compassion in all things possess benevolence
Righteousness: Do not flatter or be arrogant, do not quarrel, separate from desire and consider what is right
Propriety: Revere your lord and think of your subjects—do not disturb the proprieties between high and low even carelessly  
Wisdom: Seek widely among those who know the various aspects of all things, and do not look down on others
Trustworthiness: Pray that your heart be truly upright, abandon evil and accompany good

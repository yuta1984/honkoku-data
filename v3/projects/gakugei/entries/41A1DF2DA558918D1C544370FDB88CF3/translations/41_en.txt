For the ailment of being bitten by a dog, immediately take apricot kernels {{small text: seeds of apricots}} and roast them until they turn red,
grind them well, and according to the size of the wound,
make them into coin-sized or go stone-sized portions, then apply moxibustion like miso
moxibustion, and the apricot kernels will absorb the blood.
Do this repeatedly, changing them many times until the blood stops and when you feel pain in the wound,
then stop. Even if the wound is shallow and no blood
comes out, the poison will be absorbed into the apricot kernels, and there will be no

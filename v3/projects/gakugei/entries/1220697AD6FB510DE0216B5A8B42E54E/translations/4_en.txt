　　　Spilled water cannot return to the basin
Duke Tai Gong Wang became the grand strategist of the eastern expedition and pacified the rebellion of King Zhou, so King Wu ascended to the imperial throne and made Tai Gong Wang the lord of the great state of Qi. Thus, Tai Gong dressed himself in brocade robes, rode in a carriage drawn by four horses, led several thousand ministers and soldiers, unfurled banners in the sky, sounded gongs and drums, and proceeded majestically to his homeland. At that time, his former wife Lady Ma, from whom he had separated earlier, heard of this and came out to meet him by the roadside. She approached the front of his carriage, shed tears, and said, "I was shallow in wisdom and caused our separation earlier. Now I regret it, but it is useless. Please forgive my past wrongs and allow me to serve you again." Tai Gong Wang had a basin filled with water, spilled it on the ground, and said, "Put it back in the basin." When his wife did as he said, only mud remained in the basin. Tai Gong Wang said, "Once separated, we should not reunite again. It is like spilled water that cannot return to the basin." He pressed on his carriage and entered Qi, while his wife, filled with regret and shame, hanged herself and died.

　Duke of Zhou Dan

　　The praise says:
　His surname was Ji, his name Dan, younger
　brother of King Wu. He bore the responsibility of the court and served as regent,
　composed music and established rituals. The two uncles were
　not reconciled, dwelling in the east with resentment. He opened the golden
　coffer to reveal his loyalty, thunder and rain responded
　swiftly. In ceremonial robes he spoke of returning—
　why should there be illness? He established sacrifices in the
　state of Lu, a primordial sage for a thousand generations.

King Xiao of Zhou granted three thousand horses to Ying Feizi and commanded him, "Raise these horses well and increase their number." Feizi received the imperial command and raised the horses by the banks of the great river called Qianwei.

Across this river was the territory of the Western Rong, and every day they would bring their horses to drink water at this river. Feizi devised a stratagem: he tied mares on the riverbank and let the tamed stallions enter the river to bathe and drink water. At that time, the mares on the bank longed for the stallions and neighed incessantly. Hearing the neighing of the mares, several thousand horses of the Rong people across the river swam over to this side of the bank, and he captured them all. Within less than a year, he had presented many horses to the king.

King Xiao was greatly pleased and granted the state of Qin to Feizi. This was the ancestor of Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin.

King Xuan of Zhou loved Empress Jiang and indulged in banquets day and night, neglecting state affairs. Yin Jifu lamented this and submitted a memorial of remonstrance. The king became angry and threw the memorial to the ground, but the empress had the memorial retrieved and read it carefully, saying, "This is not the king's fault but mine." She then removed her hairpin, changed her clothes, knelt before the king and said, "Your Majesty's indulgence in pleasure and neglect of state affairs is all because of your love for me. I beg you to put me to death and attend to governing the state." King Xuan finally reformed his ways and governed well.

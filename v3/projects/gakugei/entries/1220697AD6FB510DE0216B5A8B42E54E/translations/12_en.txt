He retreated. Xiaobai quickly reached Qi and ascended to the throne. This person is called Duke Huan. Later, on Shu Ya's recommendation, Xiaobai forgave Guan Zhong's enmity of shooting an arrow at him, and respecting his wise talents, made him chancellor of Qi. Using Guan Zhong's strategies, he greatly established hegemony throughout the realm. The Son of Heaven summoned Guan Zhong and issued an edict granting him the position of senior minister.

Duke Huan of Qi used Guan Zhong's strategies, petitioned the Son of Heaven, and convened the feudal lords at a place called Beixing for an alliance. When the Duke of Song violated the alliance, Duke Huan became angry and led a great army toward the state of Song. On the way, a farmer from the state of Wei named Ning Qi was tending cattle by the roadside. Even when Duke Huan's horses approached his pasture, he didn't look back but tapped the horns of his cattle and sang, criticizing the current government. Duke Huan became angry and tried to kill him. Guan Zhong said, "Looking at this cowherd, he is no ordinary person. If you employ him to assist you, there will surely be benefits." Duke Huan listened to the advice and immediately made Ning Qi a lower army commander. Ning Qi went as an envoy to Song and persuaded them, whereupon the Duke of Song ceded fifty li of territory to Qi and sought peace. This was entirely due to Ning Qi's wisdom and strategy, pacifying the state of Song without bloodying blades, so Ning Qi was rewarded and given the position of central army strategist.

The white stones of South Mountain shine brilliantly, and within them is a carp a foot and a half long.
Born without encountering the abdication of Yao and Shun, my short brown single robe barely reaches my shinbones. From dusk I feed the cattle until midnight.
The long night stretches endlessly - when will dawn come?

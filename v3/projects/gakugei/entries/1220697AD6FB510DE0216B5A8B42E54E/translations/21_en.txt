Wu Zixu, a general of the Chu state, stepped forward and said: "Lord Gongsun Hou discusses literature but cannot grasp the theme, and cannot lift the tripod to leave his seat. How can he take on this position?" Taking up his brush, he answered:

Heaven originally depends on earth, earth depends on heaven　　Heaven and earth both follow the precedence of the five elements
River water naturally descends from above　　　　　　　　　Mount Tai has already originated from Kunlun
Earth respectfully maintains the faith of the five elements　　Human way values the perfection of all things
I request to present this poem to clarify the six questions　　Each verse is thoroughly clear, leaving nothing unsaid

After finishing his answer, he lifted the tripod with one hand, walked around in front of the feudal lords, and placed it back in its original position.
Zixu finally took the position of chief advisor and established an oath while standing on the palace steps. Each of the various states brought out their treasures to compete and display their value and worth. Only the Chu state came without preparing any treasures. Duke Ai said, "Chu is a great state - why do you have no treasures?" Zixu replied, "Our Chu has nothing it regards as treasure. We only consider virtue as our treasure. Rulers act as rulers, ministers act as ministers, and the four classes of people enjoy their occupations. This is truly the great treasure that stabilizes the nation. How could it be compared to a small pearl?" Duke Ai was convinced by this reasoning and could not respond. Zixu then told Duke Ai, "Looking at the single road through Tongguan Pass, bandits block the way. Please provide an escort." Taking Gongsun Hou with him through the pass, the hidden soldiers did not dare to attack. Entirely due to Wu Zixu's merit, the feudal lords were kept safe, and each gave thanks and returned to their countries. End of Volume 5.

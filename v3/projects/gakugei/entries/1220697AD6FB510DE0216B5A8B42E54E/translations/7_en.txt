During the reign of King Cheng, envoys from barbarian tribes came to the court and presented tribute. The next day, the envoys announced their intention to return to their homeland. When the king asked how far their country was from the capital, they reported that it was thirteen thousand li away, and it had taken them over a year to reach the capital. King Cheng commanded the Duke of Zhou, saying, "Could you devise a plan to ease the hardship of the ten-thousand-li journey for these barbarian envoys returning to their homeland?" The Duke of Zhou then created a south-pointing chariot as designed by the Yellow Emperor and bestowed it upon the barbarian envoys. The barbarians placed this chariot at the front and followed the direction it indicated, enabling them to return to their homeland in just half a year.

During the time of King Mu of Zhou, a barbarian named Xu Gada attempted to attack the capital. King Mu then commanded Xu Zi, a vassal lord of the eastern regions, to subdue him. Gada rode famous horses called the Eight Steeds. These horses could travel a thousand li in a single day. Xu Zi defeated and killed Gada, then presented the horses to King Mu. Having obtained these famous horses, the king wished to travel widely throughout the realm to explore famous mountains and immortal sites. He had a Taoist sage called Huaren serve as his guide, had the Eight Steeds pull a great carriage to the summit of Mount Kunlun, and ascended to Jade Pool. Here stood the palace where the Queen Mother of the West resided. Huaren first entered the gate to announce the emperor's imperial visit. The Queen Mother then mounted her immortal carriage of white clouds, led dozens of immortal maidens, and appeared ethereally to meet King Mu.

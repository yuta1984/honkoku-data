Picture of Lady Yan Praying at Mount Niqiu

The eulogy says:
Mount Ni stands majestically, the pride of the state of Lu
A spirit descended to the mother, who conceived a sage and bore a male child
Already proven by his form, his name was prophetic
One sincere prayer moved Heaven, becoming enlightenment for all ages

Confucius's name was Qiu, his courtesy name was Zhongni. He was a descendant of Weizi Qi, the elder brother of King Zhou of Yin. His father was Shu Liang He, his mother was of the Yan clan. Shu Liang He had many daughters but no sons, so the couple went to Mount Niqiu to pray to the gods. At that time, they lodged in the mountains and she conceived. On the twenty-seventh day of the eighth month in the twenty-second year of Duke Xiang of Lu, he was born in Zou village of Changping district in Lu. The top of his head was concave, resembling Mount Niqiu at the crown. As a child, his play always involved arranging ritual vessels and performing ceremonies. When he grew up, he was nine feet tall with a waist of ten围 in circumference, having a dragon's forehead and turtle's back, river-like eyes and a prominent brow, resembling Emperor Yao. His neck was like Gaotao's, his shoulders like Zichan's. From the waist down, he was three inches shorter than King Yu. Being naturally intelligent and wise, Duke Ding appointed him as magistrate of Zhongdu. Within one year, all directions were well governed. The Duke of Qi, fearing this, made a covenant at Jiagu and returned the territory that had been taken from Lu. Later he became Grand Minister of Justice and also administered state affairs. Within three months, the state of Lu was greatly well-ordered. Therefore, the people of Qi, wanting to disturb Lu, sent female musicians. When Lu accepted them, Confucius left Lu and traveled among various states. None of the feudal lords could employ him properly, so he corrected the Yi, Shi, Shu, Li, and Yue classics and composed the Spring and Autumn Annals. He had three thousand disciples, with seventy-two mastering the six arts. Finally, he died on the eighteenth day of the second month in the sixteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu, in the year Renxu, at the age of seventy-three. He was posthumously honored with the title King Wenxuan.

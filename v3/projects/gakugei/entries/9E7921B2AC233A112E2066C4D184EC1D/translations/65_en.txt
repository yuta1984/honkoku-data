When Prince Yamato Takeru was conducting his conquest of the eastern barbarians, as he was traveling from Sagami Province to Kazusa Province, a violent storm suddenly arose on the sea and the prince's ship was tossed about dangerously. At that time, his consort Oto-tachibana-hime vowed to the sea god that she would sacrifice her own life to save the prince's life, and finally parted the waves and threw herself into the sea. This event is recorded in the Nihon Shoki (Chronicles of Japan).

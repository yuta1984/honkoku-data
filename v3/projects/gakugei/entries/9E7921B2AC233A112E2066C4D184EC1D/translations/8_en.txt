Mountain Opening: Every year on March 21st, the memorial service for Kōbō Daishi (御影供) is performed. From this day until the 28th, the garden of Eitai-ji Temple, the administrator of this shrine, is opened for public viewing. This is commonly called "mountain opening" and attracts large crowds.

Festival: Held every other year on August 15th. On this day, three portable shrines proceed to a temporary shrine in front of Ōfunakura south of Honjo Ichinohashi bridge, returning the same day. This festival began on August 15th, Kan'ei 20 (1643), and has continued since then according to the Edo Meisho-ki. Also, in the autumn of Keian 4 (1651), for prayers for peace throughout the realm, yabusame (horseback archery) was performed at this shrine following the ritual format of Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine in Kamakura, Sagami Province. Temporary viewing stands were erected on both sides for spectators of all social classes, as recorded in the same book. The later relocation of Asakusa's Sanjūsangen-dō hall to this location may also be related to this tradition of yabusame.

From the first torii gate at the shrine's entrance, for about three to four chō inward, both sides are lined with tea houses and restaurants, with the sound of music never ceasing. Particularly at the shrine precincts, there are establishments called "Niken Chaya" (Two-House Tea Shop) and other restaurants that never lack for visitors. Oysters, corbicula clams, venus clams, and eels are considered local specialties of this area.

Sanjūsangen-dō Hall: Located about two chō east of the same place. According to tradition, during the Kan'ei era (some say it was the 19th year), an Edo archer named Bingo requested to establish a Sanjūsangen-dō hall modeled after Kyoto's Renge-ō-in Temple for archery practice. Therefore, land was granted in Asakusa, and funds were raised from various families for construction. Construction was completed in the 11th month of Kan'ei 19 (1642) (at Asakusa Kiyomizu Temple).

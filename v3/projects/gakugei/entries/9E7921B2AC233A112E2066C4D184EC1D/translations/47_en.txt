When one sound barely moves, it awakens dawn and dusk / Cultivating great standards, it resolves the troubles of worldly labor
The great bodhisattva Kannon is like this gate for people / In perfect penetration without obstruction, the root of hearing is forgotten
Neither hidden nor manifest can obstruct it, its merit and virtue are beyond discussion / Through sound enlightenment is born, directly realizing the original source
Benefiting both living and dead, dissolving a hundred grievances / When the country is peaceful and people content, these children and grandchildren
Cloud meditation is skillfully vigorous, encompassing heaven and earth
Ninth year of Genroku, year of the fire rat, fourth month, auspicious day. Respectfully recorded by Tetsugyū Ki of Gozusan.

Cherry Trees Located within the temple grounds. In the fifth year of Genbun (1740), year of the metal monkey, they received over ninety cherry tree saplings and planted them.

Peach Embankment In the first year of Genbun (1736), year of the fire dragon, they began planting these on the embankment south of the temple's outer boundary.

Founder's Hall Located east of the abbot's quarters. This place is said to have been the hermitage of Zen Master Tetsugen around the eighteenth year of Kyōhō (1733), after he left this temple. Since it houses statues of Master Tetsugen, Priest Shōsen, and Elder Shōun, it is also called the Hall of Three Generations. The deeds of founding master Zen Master Tetsugen are detailed in the stone inscription at Suiryū-ji Temple in Settsu Province.

The restoring abbot Priest Shōsen was a fourth-generation dharma descendant of Ōbaku and belonged to Zen Master Tetsugen's dharma lineage.

At that time, after Zen Master Shōun passed away, the temporary hall had also fallen into disrepair and the Buddhist statues were being damaged by rain and dew, which caused him deep concern. In the third year of Shōtoku (1713), year of the water snake, he received orders from his root teacher Priest Tetsugen and came to Edo for the first time to reside at this temple. From the first month of the second year of Kyōhō (1717), year of the fire rooster, for more than ten years, he devoted his whole heart, never minding cold, heat, wind or snow, daily entering the streets and markets of the capital for alms-begging. Having already undertaken the work of fundraising, he accumulated the rice and money received handful by handful, coin by coin, to fund the construction. By the tenth year of the same era (1725), year of the wood snake, he had completely built and completed the Buddha hall and monks' quarters that exist today. Therefore, in the second month of the fourteenth year of the same era (1729), year of the earth rooster, he held a great dharma assembly for the hall opening and general offerings, and also opened a great hungry ghost feeding ceremony for the Ullambana festival. Although it is evident that Priest Shōsen should be the founding master of this temple, for certain reasons Zen Master Tetsugen was designated as the founding master, his own teacher Priest Hōshū as the second generation, and since Zen Master Shōun had great merit in the founding enterprise, he was called the first generation founder, while he himself took the seat of the third generation.

After Zen Master Ingen's naturalization, he maintained a vegetarian diet with one meal per day, deeply pitied the poor, and stored nothing on his person except Buddhist statues, scriptures, and old robes. In his daily religious practices, he recited the five volumes of the Prajñāpāramitā Naya chapter and 150 volumes of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra's chapter on vows and practices, and copied the sacred name of Kannon, the number accumulating like mountains. He also copied the entire Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra in 600 volumes, performing one hundred prostrations for each character. Earlier, when he left home and attained the Way, he entered Suiryū-ji Temple in Settsu Province and accomplished the dharma path.

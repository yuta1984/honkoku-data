Record of the Origin of the Double-Sided Great Flag
On the 21st day of the 5th month of Kōan 4, year of the metal snake (1281), over 4,000 Mongol pirate ships with more than 240,000 men came to attack from the Great Yuan kingdom, and in the 7th month defensive battles were fought in Kyushu. At that time, Saint Nichiren wrote a great mandala for prayers within the circle of this flag of the Eight Great Dragon Kings, and when Prince Koreyasu proceeded to Kyushu with this flag leading the way, as soon as the military commander reached Kyushu, the spiritual gods of Japan provided protection, divine winds blew, completely destroying those pirate ships and all their men, driving them back to foreign lands. Because it became an auspicious flag, our family came to be entrusted with it.

Origin of the Mongol-Repelling Flag Mandala: In the reign of the 90th Human Emperor Go-Uda, in the 3rd year of Kōan, year of the metal dragon, spring, 2nd month (corresponding to the 17th year of Yuan Zhiyuan), the Yuan envoy Du Shizhong was killed in Kamakura.
According to records, in the 1st year of Yuan Shizu's Zhiyuan era (corresponding to Japan's Bun'ei 1), Koreans Zhao Yi and others selected envoys to be sent with the message that diplomatic relations should be established with Japan. In the same 3rd year, 8th month, Hebu Shilang Heidi and Libu Shilang Yin Hong were commanded to serve as envoys to Japan.
Though Yuan envoys frequently came to Japan with letters until Kōan 4, Japan did not respond. The Yuan king was enraged and appointed Arahan (written as Asihan in the Gorin-sho volume 21; Arahan fell ill on the journey and died, so Atahai was appointed to replace him), Fan Wenhu, and the four generals Xindu and Hong Chaqiu to lead an army of 100,000 to attack Japan.
According to the Dongguo Tongjian volume 38, Korean records state that Chaqiu and Xindu led 40,000 Mongol-Korean-Chinese troops departing from Happ'o, while Fan Wenhu led 100,000 barbarian troops from Jiangnan, both meeting at Iki Island. The Taiheiki records 3,000,000 cavalry, while the Engi records 240,000 men. In the same 4th year, year of the metal snake, summer, 5th month (corresponding to Yuan Zhiyuan 18), Mongol pirate ships (the Dongguo Tongjian records 3,500 warships, while the Taiheiki records over 70,000 vessels; the Engi records over 4,000 vessels - the numbers vary) were commanded to come and attack Chinzei, entering the two islands of Iki and Tsushima as well as Chikuzen and Hizen provinces.

The people of the realm were all terrified. At this point in Kamakura, Sei-i Taishōgun Prince Koreyasu intended to personally proceed to Kyushu to repel the Mongols, making Utsunomiya Sadatsuna the commanding general of the vanguard. He also commanded Saint Nichiren to write a great mandala within the circle of a sun and moon flag, gave that flag to Sadatsuna, and had him depart for the western seas. This was on the 1st day of the intercalary 7th month of the same year. When Sadatsuna reached the seashore and raised that flag, hurricane winds suddenly arose, towering waves flooded the sky, the enemy ships drifted about, many were destroyed upon striking rocky cliffs, and countless barbarian soldiers drowned and were buried in the bellies of fish. The Yuan commanders suffered great defeat. About 30,000 were taken prisoner and all were beheaded. The remainder, Yu Chang, Mo Qing, Wu...

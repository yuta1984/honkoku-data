And thus he obtained a rabbit.
One account says that the sword Murakumo (Ame-no-Murakumo) that the prince wore drew itself and cut down the grass around the prince, and by this he was able to escape. Therefore, that sword was called Kusanagi (Grass-Cutting). Murakumo is pronounced "Murakumo."

When the prince was about to be deceived, he burned and destroyed all those bandits. Therefore, that place was called Yaizu (Burnt Harbor). He then advanced to Sagami and, intending to go to Kazusa, looked out over the sea and declared loudly, "This is just a small sea - I can leap across it standing." When he reached the middle of the sea, a violent storm suddenly arose, and the prince's ship was tossed about and could not proceed. At that time, there was a concubine accompanying the prince called Princess Ototachibana, daughter of Oshiyama Sukune of the Hozumi clan. She addressed the prince, saying, "Now the wind has risen and the waves are fierce, and the royal ship is about to sink. This must surely be the will of the sea god. I pray that I may substitute my life for that of the prince and enter the sea." Having finished speaking, she was covered by the waves and entered the sea. The violent storm immediately ceased, and the ship was able to reach shore. Therefore, the people of that time called that sea Hashirimizu (Running Water). (Remainder omitted)

The Paired Camphor Trees - Located to the right front of the main shrine. These are what the world calls "joined trees" (renri), being two trunks from one root. They separate into two branches about four feet above ground. According to the shrine records, in ancient times, when Prince Yamato Takeru enshrined the divine spirit of Princess Ototachibana and took his meal, he used camphor chopsticks and declared, "If peace reigns in the realm until the end of time, both these chopsticks shall flourish," and with his own hands planted them in the ground east of the mausoleum. Later they sprouted branches and leaves and have flourished to this day. Nearby there are also camphor saplings, which are likewise two trunks from one root.

Sacred Treasure - One ancient bell, about eight inches long, with beautiful bronze coloring.
Similar bells exist at Shōtōji Temple in Kashima, Hitachi Province, and are also kept in the house of Agatamaro. Since their forms are largely similar with minor differences, I have merely copied and added their illustrations.

The shrine records state: In the 40th year of the reign of the 12th Human Emperor Keikō, when Prince Yamato Takeru was subduing the eastern barbarians, he boarded the royal ship to travel from Sagami Province to Kazusa Province. When he reached the middle of the sea, a violent storm suddenly arose, the royal ship was tossed about and could not proceed. At that time, the concubine Princess Ototachibana said, "Now the wind has risen and the waves are fierce, and the royal ship is about to sink. This must surely be the will of the sea god. I pray that I may offer my body to redeem the prince's life and enter the sea." Having finished speaking, she parted the waves and entered. The violent storm immediately ceased, and the royal ship was able to reach shore. (The sea where they encountered the difficult wind is called Hashirimizu. Now it is written as Hashirimizu.)

Afterward, Princess Ototachibana's skirt floated on the sea surface in this area, so the prince commanded his retainers to recover it at this place, had an altar built and sacred fences erected around it to make a mausoleum. (A mausoleum was built at the place where the sacred remains washed ashore - this is Azuma Myōjin of Kisarazu in Kazusa Province. Also, where her sacred comb washed ashore was recovered and made into a tomb - this is said to be Azuma Myōjin of Umezawa in present Sagami Province.)

This shrine was originally only a rough mound, but in the first year of Jōkyū (1219), various retainers under Hōjō Yasutoki's command - Suzuki Hayato-no-kami, Kamio Uneme, Ide Daigaku and others - established a small shrine and endowed it with 300 koku of shrine lands. Later, during the Eiroku period (1558-1570), Tōyama Tamba-no-kami, a retainer of the Hōjō family of Odawara, is said to have rebuilt this shrine.

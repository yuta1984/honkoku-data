[Continuation of Heikazan Hoon-ji Temple]
memorial tablets are enshrined.

Sanjubanshin Hall: Located to the front right of the main hall. A book called "Kanto Kosen-roku" states: "A hall of the thirty guardian deities was set up nearby and used as a place for secret discussions." Additionally, books such as "Hojo Godai-ki" and "Odawara Jitsuki" record that "Suketaka betrayed the Hojo family and crossed swords with Satomi Yoshihiro, seeking to permanently govern the land of Toshima County. Together with his brothers, he drank sacred water in front of the Banshin Hall and made an oath saying 'Now that we have decided on this matter, we shall never turn back.'" At that time, it was located at Hirakawa within the present castle grounds.

This temple was originally located at Hirakawa within the present castle grounds and was called Honju-in. <<The Hojo family's domain register states "land from Mita-uchi Soryobun is attached to Honjubo temple holdings." Thus, Honjubo likely refers to Honju-in>> It appears that the name was changed to Hoon-ji in later times. Long after the Tensho period, it was moved to the vicinity of Yanagihara, then relocated to Yanaka Shimizu-zaka, and finally moved to its present location in the early Genroku period. <<Within the temple grounds is a small Inari shrine called Hirakawa Shimizu>>
<<This serves as evidence of the move from Hirakawa to Shimizu-zaka, combining the two place names in this designation>>

Narihira Tenjin Shrine: Located within the grounds of Nanzo-in, a Tendai sect temple in Naka-no-go. According to tradition, it enshrines the spirit of Ariwara no Narihira Ason. <<"Edo Meisho-ki" states that "when Narihira was about to go up to the capital and boarded a boat, the boat capsized in the bay around here and he drowned. The local people built a mound for him, so the shape of the mound resembles a boat. That location is still called Narihira Village today." The booklet "Edo Kanoko" also writes it as Narihei and treats him as a sumo wrestler, but none of these accounts are sufficient as evidence. According to Kyuryotei, "this shrine was originally located on the land of what is now the Suifu-ko residence in Koume, but was moved to its present location around the time of the Yokogawa canal excavation." Nankotei's theory states that "since Naka-no-go was Narihira's temporary residence, it should be called Chujo-no-go (Middle Captain's Village), but this was mistakenly called Naka-no-go," though this is likely a forced interpretation>>
<<Upon examination, the legends of this shrine are confused and unclear. In Nankotei's "Sawa," it states that "the village of Miyoshino in Kawagoe is the place mentioned in Zaigo-chujo's poem 'nakunaru Miyoshino no sato,' so later the spirits of Narihira and Kan-shin were enshrined together in the auxiliary shrine of Miyoshino Tenjin. Since this place is also near the Sumida River and, relating to the 'Tale of Ise,' the spirit of Narihira was enshrined here and Kan-shin was also invited, it came to be called Narihira Tenjin." Like this theory, it was likely a later fabrication based on the "Tale of Ise">>

Nakago Hachiman-gu: Located in Arai-machi to the south of the same area, it is served by Senryu-ji, a Tendai sect temple in Minami-banba-machi. According to tradition, it was established in Bunmei 7, year of Kinoto-hitsuji.

Dairoku-ten Shrine: Located to the north adjacent to Okawabata, with Fugen-ji serving as its administrator. This shrine is also said to have been established through invitation in Bunmei 5, year of Mizunoto-mi.

Tada Yakushi Hall: Located at Okawabata in the same area, it is called Gyokutosan Myosho-in Toko-ji. <<It belongs to the Tendai sect under Toei-zan>> The plaque reading "Gyokutosan" hanging at the main gate was written by the Korean Sekketsudo Ri Sanshaku. The statue of Yakushi Buddha, the principal image, was created by Eshin Sozu and is said to have been the devotional Buddha of Lord Tada Manju. <<Statues of the twelve divine generals are placed on the left and right side altars>>
According to tradition, in the second year of Tentoku during the reign of Emperor Murakami, a temple complex was built in Tada-go, Settsu Province...

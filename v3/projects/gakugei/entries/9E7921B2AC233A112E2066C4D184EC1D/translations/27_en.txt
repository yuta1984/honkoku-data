After that, it was moved to this location. Many worshippers visit on the 8th and 12th of each month, which are designated as festival days.

**Fukagawa Hachiman Shrine御旅所 (Temporary Shrine)** Located in front of the large boat warehouse at Ōkawa-bata. During the festival of Tomioka Hachiman Shrine, the portable shrine is carried to this location.

**Benzaiten Shrine** Located at the southern end of Ichi-no-hashi (First Bridge) in the same area. The deity enshrined is the same as that of Enoshima in Sagami Province. It was established in the early Genroku period (1688-1704) by Grand Inspector Sugiyama. Many worshippers visit on the days of the Snake (己巳).

[According to tradition, Inspector Sugiyama was from Ōshū and was called Shin'ichi. His ambition was to make a name for himself throughout the realm. He fasted for 21 days and traveled to Enoshima in Sagami Province, where he secluded himself in the Celestial Maiden's Cave and earnestly prayed for his wish. As he indeed received divine blessing, he ultimately mastered the art of acupuncture. Therefore, it is called the Sugiyama School in the world. Around the Keian era (1648-1652), he received the shogun's command and was repeatedly summoned to Edo Castle to serve as a close retainer. In the early Genroku period, he was granted the current land. Here, the rules of his school were established. Every year on February 16th and June 19th, blind musicians gather before the altar to play the biwa and perform Heike recitations, following the practice of Sekitōsha in Kyoto.]

**Kokufuzan Ekōin Temple** Located at the eastern end of Ryōgoku Bridge. [In ancient times, this area was also part of Yanagishima and was called Ōnishi, as recorded in a booklet called "Shiseki Katsukō."] This temple follows the tradition of Priest Shōnen and serves as a Buddhist realm of the Shasei sect. During the great fire of Meireki 3 (1657), a grand Segaki memorial service is held every year on July 7th to pray for the souls of those who died in the fire. Also on the 8th, there are memorial services for the benefits of both this world and the next for patrons who make offerings. The plaque reading "Kokufuzan" on the main gate was written by Priest Enzō Jōgetsu.

**Main Hall** The seated statue of Amida Buddha is about one jō (approximately 3 meters) tall. [In the winter of Genroku 16 (1703), the temple suffered a fire disaster, and the old principal image, a bronze Amida Buddha, melted. Therefore, the temple's 4th abbot, Priest Kan'yo Yūkan, created the current principal image. The bronze statue mold that remains in front of the hall was used as the principal image. This hall was formerly located where the current abbot's quarters stand, but after the fire of Tenna 2 (1682), the temple's 3rd abbot, Priest Kanrei, moved it to its current location.]

**Bitchū Thousand-Body Amida Buddha** [Enshrined in the rear hall, commonly called the Inner Sanctuary. The principal image is 1 shaku 1 sun tall, made by Eshin Sōzu, and is said to be of the same body as the Black Principal Image. It was the devotional Buddha of Priest Jun'yo Kioku, the 23rd head priest of Enzan. He was commanded to perform memorial services for the over 108,000 souls who died by fire and drowning in the Meireki fire. At that time, the government had a temporary Buddha hall constructed, and memorial services were performed with this sacred image as the principal Buddha. Therefore, it was also called the Buddha of Salvation for souls who died by fire and drowning.]

**Three Buddha Hall** [Located to the right of the main hall, enshrining the three honored ones: Amida, Shakyamuni, and Dainichi. This hall was established by the government during the Manji era (1658-1661) for memorial services for the souls of those who died in prison or by execution. The stone stupas in front of the hall have these purposes carved into them. Sixteen monks from this temple who daily make rounds through the streets of Edo to beg for offerings constantly reside in this hall.]

**One-Word Kannon** [Located beside the pond. The principal image is Shō Kannon, made by Eshin Sōzu. It is said to have been moved from Shōdaiji Temple in Nara. People with faith who earnestly pray to this principal image will have their wishes fulfilled with just one word, hence it is called so to express its remarkable spiritual efficacy.]

**Benzaiten Shrine** [Located in the same place. It is commonly called the Straw-Wrapped Benzaiten. Long ago, while the founding priest of this temple was conducting Buddhist practices and nembutsu chanting, he found a straw wrapper containing only the head of Benzaiten in front of the Buddha hall. Knowing it was truly the work of Kōbō Daishi, he newly carved a Buddha body, built a small shrine, and made it the guardian deity of this temple.]

**Batō Kanzeon** [Located to the left front of the main hall. During the Meireki era, the shogun deeply mourned when a beloved famous horse died, and issued a command to bury and memorialize it at this temple. Therefore, the founding priest dedicated it as Batō Kannon.]

**Enkō Daishi Hall** [Located similarly nearby. When Enkō Daishi responded to the request of a certain courtesan from Murotsu in Harima Province, a boatman urgently announced the ship's departure, so only the head was given. Later, that courtesan made the complete body by kneading clay. The courtesan became a nun, devoted herself to nembutsu meditation, and ultimately achieved great enlightenment at age 75.]

**Lotus Pond** [Priest Shin'yo always used lotus seeds instead of prayer beads for chanting. The accumulated lotus seeds reached 35 koku (about 175 cubic meters). The lotus growing in this pond today is said to come from these seeds.]

**Camphor Tree** [This was also hand-planted by Priest Shin'yo and stands beside the same pond.]

**Bronze Statue of Amida Buddha** [Located in front of the main hall. The seated statue is one jō six shaku (about 4.8 meters) tall.]

[Continuation of the Origin of Prince Koreyasu's Mongol Repulsion Flag Mandala]
Banko and the others were pardoned and allowed to return home. This was done to inform the Yuan emperor of these events. Among the defeated Mongol soldiers, only these three men were able to return home. <<Note: According to the Daigaku Engi-ho>>

<<Note: In the 18th year of Zhiyuan under Emperor Shizu of Yuan, over 100,000 soldiers attacking Japan died on the sea islands, and only thirty were said to have returned home, but according to the Isho Nihon-den, the character "ten" in "thirty" is an error. The Yuan History states that among 100,000 soldiers, only three were able to return>>

<<Note: The names of the three are given: Yu Chang, Mo Qing, and Wu Banko. The above is excerpted from the essential points of Yuan History's Japan Chronicle, Tokoku Tsukan, Continued Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Governance, Gangmu, Daigaku Engi-ho, Gorin-sho, Imperial Chronological Collection, Taiheiki, Hojo Nine Generations Chronicle, and this temple's origin records>>

Therefore, after the victory, this flag was permanently granted to Sadatsuna as a reward. Sadatsuna recorded its history and deposited it at Mount Minobu. However, the founding priest Nichikyo of our temple brought it from Minobu to become a permanent treasure of our temple.

Hoshuyama Daiho-ji Temple: Located about three cho west of the same area, it belongs to the Nichiren sect and is affiliated with Hoon-ji Temple in the same location. This temple was founded in the 6th year of Taiei (1526), year of hinoe-inu, and its founding priest was Daikennin Nichiko, the eighth head priest of Hoon-ji. At that time, it was located together with Hoon-ji in the Hirakawa area within the current castle grounds, but was later moved to Yanaka, and then relocated to its present site during the Genroku period.

Sanjubanshin Hall <<Note: Located to the left of the main hall, the statues of the protective deities were created by Nichiko. When Master Nichiko was six years old, he contracted smallpox and had already died, but while his parents were overcome with grief, through divine revelation from the Thirty Guardian Deities, they obtained effective medicine>>

<<Note: He immediately revived. This was considered the protection of the Kofu Stone and the guardian deities, so later they had their child become a monk. This was Nichiko. Even now, dream-inspired smallpox amulets are distributed from this temple>>

Kofu Stone <<Note: Secretly enshrined in the main hall of this temple. Now a copy is placed inside the egg-shaped pagoda. The original is a stone pagoda carved with the Lotus Sutra title in Nichiren's own handwriting. According to tradition, this sacred stone was originally located in Kameido Village>>

<<Note: Kameido Village was formerly on the highway to Kamakura. In the 5th year of Kencho (1253), when Saint Nichiren traveled from Shimousa Province to Kamakura, he passed through that place and wrote the Lotus Sutra title on this stone surface, making a great vow for the widespread propagation of the teaching. Hence it is called the Kofu Stone>>

<<Note: Later it was handed down through the Chiba family, so it was also called the Chiba Stone. However, since Nichiko was originally of the Chiba clan, after his ordination and entry into the priesthood, he founded this temple and also enshrined this sacred stone here. Master Nichiko also carved the sacred names of the Thirty Guardian Deities on this stone surface>>

Jozaizan Ryosen-ji Temple: Also called Nison-kyo-in. Located south of the same area, adjacent to the north of Hoon-ji, it is one of the eighteen Jodo sect seminaries. The statue of Amida Buddha is the work of Jikaku Daishi, and the statue of Shakyamuni Buddha is a Tang dynasty Buddha. <<Note: For this reason it is called Nison-kyo-in>> The founding priest was Nenrensha Sen'yo, also called Taicho Osho. In medieval times, the temple had already fallen into ruin and the seminary lineage was about to be severed, when Sairensha Shin'yo Shun'o deeply lamented this situation and repeatedly petitioned the government, finally receiving permission in the 2nd year of Jokyo (1685) to restore the seminary to its former pure state. However, he yielded the achievement to his successor and retired to Kumagai Temple in Musashi Province. Therefore, Korensha Myo'yo Yu'an Kakuei was made the restoration founder. Kakuei was a member of the sect...

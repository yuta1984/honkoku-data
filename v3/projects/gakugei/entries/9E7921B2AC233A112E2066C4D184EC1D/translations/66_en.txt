【Continuation of Azuma Gongen Shrine】
According to records, the land registry of the Odawara Hojo family also notes the place name Kasai Omurai among the territories of Toyama Tamba no Kami. Omurai is adjacent to Kameido village and refers to the settlement north of this shrine. In ancient times, the area around the shrine grounds was probably also part of Tamba no Kami's territory, which may be why he undertook repairs of this shrine.

**Uegami Shotoku Taishi Hall** Same location. Along the riverbank on the path from the back gate of Kameido Tenmangu, it is enshrined within the grounds of Jiun-san Ryugan-ji, a Tendai sect temple. The sacred image of Prince Shotoku is said to have been carved by the prince himself and measures 2 shaku 5 sun in height. Hair from the prince and his consort is said to be planted on top of the sacred statue, hence it is commonly called "Hair-Planting Prince." According to the Prince's Chronicle held by this temple, in the 11th year of Empress Suiko (603 CE, year of the Boar), when the prince was 32 years old, on the 28th day of the 11th month, he obtained sacred wood at Hinokuma Palace, carved his own image, and enshrined it in the Hall of Dreams at Ikaruga. The Prince's Biography and other records do not mention the creation of this image in this year. Thereafter, successive emperors built great temples and rulers of each generation moved it to various halls. From when it was enshrined at Kudara-dera temple built in the 7th year of Emperor Tenji until Keicho 7 (1602), it was moved between various temples including Daian-ji in Nanto, Renge-o-in in Kyoto, Shingo-ji at Takao, Hannya-o-ji in Taga, Totsu Province, Hokke-do in Kamakura, Sagami Province, Saimyo-ji in Kosuge, Musashi Province, Sugawara-dera in Shiga, Omi Province, and Kontai-ji in Settsu Province. Finally, in the 10th month of Horeki 12 (1762), it was moved from Seikoku-ji in Ebara District, Musashi Province, and has been permanently enshrined at this temple.

The temple's back garden has many bush clover planted, creating a magnificent sight when they bloom in mid-autumn. Hence it is popularly called "Bush Clover Temple."

**Myoken Daibosatsu** Located at the corner across the river bridge on the same riverbank. It is enshrined at Hoshō-ji, a Nichiren sect temple. The origin of the main image is unclear, but in recent times it has shown remarkable divine efficacy, so worshippers never cease coming. In front of the hall stands a sacred tree called "Shadow-Manifestation Pine." It is said that the main deity first descended upon this tree, hence it is also called "Star-Falling Pine" or "Thousand-Year Pine." It is said that during the Genna era, when the great lord (shogun) visited this place, it was newly granted the name "Mirror Pine."

**Tensho-san Saikyo-ji** Located about three cho to the west of the same area. It is a Nichiren sect temple with a statue of Shakyamuni Buddha as the main image. It was founded during the Kan'ei era by Tsushin-in Nichikyo, the 27th generation of Enzan. This temple holds [artifacts related to] Kamakura Shogun Prince Koreyasu's suppression of the Mongols.

This waka poem is an original composition by the lay priest Toda Mosui, included in his poetry collection called "Tori no Ato" (Traces of Birds). In the preface, it states that this Azuma Forest was the place where a person called "Azumabito" (Eastern Person) lived. The identity of this Eastern Person remains unknown to this day.

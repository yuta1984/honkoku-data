[Continuation of Shōhōzan Honkyūji Temple]
The statue of the founding patriarch (Nichiren) enshrined at this temple is said to have had its head carved by Master Nichirō and the body completed by Master Nichihō. Inside the body is contained a three-sun six-bu slip with the Daimoku (sacred title), which is said to be an authentic work by Nichirō and Nichihō. This sacred image was originally enshrined at Kan'ōji Temple in Yanaka, but when that temple converted to another sect in Genroku 4, a devout parishioner named Yamaki Yasō took this statue along with images of Sankō Tenshi and Daikokuten to his home for worship, and later they were enshrined at this temple. The Shichimen Daimyōjin enshrined within the temple grounds is a sacred image received through divine inspiration by a lady-in-waiting named Kazuma-me who served at the Zuiryūji-den, a convent in Karakumurakumo in the capital, and for certain reasons it came to be enshrined at this temple.

Shōgakuzan Myōgenji Temple - Located in Banba-chō, North Honjo in the same area. It belongs to the Nichiren sect and is affiliated with Myōkenji Temple in Sano, Shimotsuke. It was founded during the Kenmu period by Chūrō priest Tenmoku Shōnin. The three large characters "Shōgakuzan" on the main gate plaque are in the calligraphy of Hirabayashi Shunshin, signed "Shōjitsu-kyo."

Gyūhōzan Saishōji Temple - Also called Myōō-in. Located on Omotemachi in the same area, it belongs to the Tendai sect under Tōeizan. The statue of the principal deity Fudō Myōō was created by Priest Rōben. This temple serves as the administrator temple for Ushi-gozen and was founded by Great Master Jikaku in Jōgan 2 (Kōshin year), with Ryōhon Ajari as the founding priest. During the Kan'ei period, the Shogun frequently visited this temple during his hunting excursions in this area, so temporary palace buildings were grandly constructed. (Even now, Sannō Gongen is enshrined on the site called the palace ruins.)

Ushijima Shinmei Shrine - Located adjacent to the same area. According to tradition, it was established during the Jōgan period. Its administrator is called Jingūji and is managed concurrently by Saishōji Temple. (According to the Edo Meisho-ki, during the Jūei period of Emperor Antoku, the villagers of Honjo had a dream in which Ise Grand Shrine appeared from the void, and within great radiance, a sublime voice chanted the text from the Lotus Sutra's Juryō chapter "In this land of mine there is peace and tranquility, with heavenly beings constantly filling it," declaring "I am the Great Ise Shrine." When the villagers shared their dreams, they found them identical in every detail, so considering it miraculous, they constructed a shrine and invited the deity of Ise. Incidentally, Ushijima appears in the Hōjō family's territorial records as "Edo Ushijima Four Villages" within the domain of Tominaga Yashirō. Even now, this general name applies to the area from Honjo Naka-no-gō to Susaki. Ancient maps of Edo show "Ushijima" marked near Ekōin Temple.)

Taishi-dō - Located in Motomachi in the same area, enshrined at the Tendai sect temple Nyoirin-ji. The principal deity is Prince Shōtoku.

...pressed upon him personally. The high priest prayed, "May I perform one thousand sessions of the Lotus Sutra so that it may become the power of my salvation and protection." After awakening from his dream, he increasingly added reverence and weight to his worship of the principal image. When he saw that the Buddha statue was covered with sweat and tears of gratitude dripped onto the lotus pedestal, it commanded his heart. From then on, he performed one thousand sessions of Kannon offerings day and night without rest, and the entire country was able to escape the suffering of epidemic disease. Therefore, common people call it Migawari Kanzeon (Substitute Kannon).

Garyū-bai (Reclining Dragon Plum Tree) - Located at Seikō-an in the same place, commonly called "Plum Mansion." Its flowers are of superior quality with double petals and pure white color. The fragrance is extremely deep, and its form resembles a dragon coiled and lying down. It spreads across several dozen jō in all directions within the garden, with branches not reaching high but each branch half-entering the ground and emerging from the earth to produce new stems. It is difficult to distinguish which is the main trunk. Moreover, it has curves that naturally display its vigor, hence the name "Reclining Dragon." This matches what is called "garyū-bai" or "bairyū" in plum catalogs.
《Annotation: The Plum Catalog states: "Twenty ri from the capital there is a reclining plum tree, bent and twisted for over ten jō, traditionally said to be from Tang China, called 'plum dragon,' and refined people bring wine to enjoy it"》

Shinmei-gū Shrine - Located in the same place, the shrine building sits atop a single mound. According to tradition, in ancient times this land was a small island surrounded by sea. At that time, when crossing ships encountered difficulties with wind and waves, they were able to preserve their lives through the protection of the Ise Grand Shrines. In gratitude, they enshrined this deity here and built the shrine.
《Annotation: In ancient times, many ships anchored at this place, so it was called "iri" (entrance), and even now this old name is preserved in the place name》
What is called the "Net-drying Zelkova" stands beside the shrine and serves as the sacred tree.
《Annotation: Long ago when this area was continuous sea, fishermen hung and dried their nets here, hence the name. Even now when digging in this area, objects called "anchors" used with fishing nets emerge from the soil, which serves as proof that this was once seaside, according to local custom. This zelkova is also called "Taihei Zelkova" and the shrine grounds are called "Taihei Mound"》

Myōō-san Tōkaku-ji Temple - Located to the south of the same place, it belongs to the Shingon sect and is affiliated with Renge-ji Temple in Terashima. The principal images are the three honored ones: Amida, Kannon, and Seishi. This temple was founded in the fourth year of Kyōroku (1531), and its founding priest was called Genkaku Hōin.
Fudō Hall 《Annotation: Enshrined at this temple. It is a carved image by Priest Rōben and is said to be of the same body as the principal image of Ōyama-dera Temple in Sagami Province》
《Annotation: The origin story states: In ancient times when this temple was a grass hermitage, the founding priest Genkaku Hōin resided here. However, in the fourth year of Kyōroku (1531), at one time a traveling lay Buddhist practitioner came and requested lodging. The priest granted permission and they slept in the same bed that night. The next morning when the priest rose early to enter the Buddha hall, a robust man stood bewildered nearby. When the priest found this strange and asked the reason, the man was like a deaf-mute and gave no answer at all. At that time...》

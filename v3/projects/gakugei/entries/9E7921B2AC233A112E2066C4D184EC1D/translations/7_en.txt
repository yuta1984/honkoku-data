Tomioka Hachiman Shrine is located on Fukagawa Eitai Island. Its Buddhist administrator (bettō) belongs to the Shingon sect and is called Daieizan Kongō Shin'in Eitai-ji Temple. According to the Edo Meisho-ki (Records of Famous Places in Edo), in the summer of Kanen 5 (1628), due to the spiritual manifestation of Kōbō Daishi (Kūkai), the two head priests of Mount Kōya, learned monks, and other monks of the eastern provinces gathered on this Eitai Island and held Buddhist discussions for ninety days of one summer. They separately built a portrait hall of Kōbō Daishi and lectured on the esoteric mysteries of Shingon's three secrets. From then on, dragon lanterns are said to appear before the shrine.

Main Shrine - Enshrined deity: Emperor Ōjin (the divine image is said to be made by Kan'shin). Auxiliary shrines: right - Amaterasu Ōmikami, left - Hachiman Daimyōjin - three seats in total.

According to tradition, in ancient times, Minamoto no Yorimasa (Gen Sani Yorimasa) venerated the divine image of this Hachiman Shrine. Later it was transmitted to the Chiba family, Shogun Ashikaga Takauji, Kamakura Kubō Motouji, Kanrei Uesugi and other families. Ōta Dōkan's reverence was particularly deep, but after Dōkan's death, the whereabouts of the divine image became uncertain. During the Kan'ei era, the priest Chōsei obtained it through spiritual revelation. About twelve chō east of the current shrine, on the seashore of Sunamura, there is a shrine called Moto-Hachiman Shrine, said to be the old site of the current shrine. Therefore, the current shrine was founded on this site, but it had not yet achieved magnificent decoration, being only a simple thatched structure. However, Hōzan-shi, the founder of Mount Ikoma in Yamato Province, became a dharma disciple of Eitai-ji's Shūkō Ajari in Shōhō 3 (1646), and around Kanbun 4 (1664), inspired by a divine dream, he managed the shrine construction. It was completed in a short time and became well-appointed. From then on, the divine light renewed daily, and it became the foremost shrine east of the river.

The plaque inscribed "Hachiman Shrine" at the current shrine is the authentic calligraphy of Prince Shōren'in-no-miya Sonshō Hōshin'nō. There are many subsidiary shrines within the compound, so they are all omitted here.

Four Corner Guardian Shrines of the Current Shrine: Northeast corner - Ebisu Shrine (located at the riverbank of Miyakawa-chō); Southeast corner - Kōjin Shrine (located beside the road in Irifune-chō); Southwest corner - Marishiten Shrine (located south of Nakachō in front of Eitai-ji gate); Northwest corner - Taishō Kongō Shrine (located in Kuroe-chō in the same area).

Sonome Cherry Tree: Located within the garden of Eitai-ji. During the Shōtoku era, a woman called Sonome who loved haikai poetry is said to have planted this. It is also called Kasen (Immortal Poet) Cherry. Now it is withered and barely exists. At that time there were thirty-six trees, hence the name Kasen.

Second Torii Gate: Located in front of the main gate, made of stone. Inscriptions are carved on the left and right pillars. This text was composed by Mr. Narushima and written by Akai Tokusui. The text is as follows:

"Inscription and Preface for the Stone Torii of Tomigaoka Hachiman Shrine
In the year of Yongzheng Dun Zang, seventeen townspeople joined forces and contributed money to build a stone torii in front of Tomioka Hachiman Shrine. Its height is about one jō five shaku, with left and right proportionally spaced. Stone replaces wood to ensure permanence. The stone was taken from Mount Dohi in Sagami Province. This undertaking was to respectfully pray for the nation and extend to personal prayers. A detailed account was brought to consult Master Hōkei for the text. Master Hōkei heard this: 'Even humble water plants can be offered to the gods and spirits through sincere faith.' How much more so for this permanent structure where devotion gathers and virtue originates. Here we observe the hearts of the people toward their superiors. The gods' pleasure can be known. Therefore, I record this account, engrave it on the right pillar as an inscription, and connect it to the left pillar as required.

The inscription says:
Long ago Emperor Ōjin, his imperial virtue harmonizing with Heaven, originated in Toyo and moved to Otokoyama. His awesome spiritual power manifest and glorious, through generations for a thousand years. In the distant eastern sea, this sacred shrine for one lord. These stone pillars, polished before the shrine. Earnest prayers of gratitude, private supplications extending continuously. Sincere loyalty and reverent respect, divine observation clearly evident. The hidden palace's mysterious blessings, fortune and prosperity for eternal years."

○The tiger has a form
like a cat
but is as large as
an ox. Its color is yellow
with thick front legs,
and all the strength of its body
is concentrated in its front legs. When it
travels at night, one eye emits
light while the other eye
sees objects. Its voice is like
thunder and it can well
raise winds. When a tiger
roars once on a
mountain, all beasts are said to
cower in fear.

○The Zougu (Zouyu) is a white tiger.
Its
tail is longer than
its body. It is a
benevolent beast.

○The leopard has a form
very similar to a tiger
but is smaller. Its head is round
and its face is white. Its fur color is
pale yellow with white
spots.
It is extremely beautiful, therefore
it is said to admire
its own coat.

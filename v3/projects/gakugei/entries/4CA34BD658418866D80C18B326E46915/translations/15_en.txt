○The peacock is larger than a goose,
with a height of four shaku.
It has three feathers on its head,
about one sun in length. Its entire body
is green with luster,
and the eye-spots on its tail shine blue.
When people clap their hands and sing,
it spreads its tail and dances.

○The golden pheasant resembles
a mountain bird but is smaller, with feathers of five
colors. It is like the peacock's
feathers. Biechi and
saikei are the same.

○The silver pheasant resembles
a mountain chicken and is white in color with black patterns.
Its tail is about three to four
shaku long. When eaten,
it supplements the body and
neutralizes poison.

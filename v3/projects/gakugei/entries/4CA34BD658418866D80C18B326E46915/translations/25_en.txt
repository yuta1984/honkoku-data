○The Konkei (large fowl) is a large type
of chicken. It is also called
Sokei. They are abundant in the Shu
region of China. Their feather colors come in
two varieties: black and
white. Their nature is
brave and they fight well.
Also, there are chickens that came
from the Kingdom of Siam, which are
called Siam chickens. They are
slightly smaller than the Konkei,
with thick and tall legs, and are brave.
They enjoy fighting.
○For chickens, those from Korea
are considered good. Their feather colors vary
greatly. They are commonly called
Shokoku. When roasted and eaten,
they supplement bodily weakness, warm the interior,
stop bleeding, and are good for women's
menstrual disorders.
○Hina (chicks) refer to the fledglings
of all birds. Those that are
newly born and peck by
themselves are called hina. Those that the mother bird feeds
mouth-to-mouth are called koku.

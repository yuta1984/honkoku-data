○The Komadori (Japanese robin) is smaller than the bulbul, with both head and back being reddish-brown in color, and having black feathers on its belly. It lives in the mountains and does not come down to villages. People appreciate its song and often keep it as a pet.
○The Kyūkanchō (hill myna) is also called Saruka. It is smaller than a pigeon, with an entirely black body and white feathers on its wings. It can speak human words well. It is definitely a foreign bird.
○The Fūchō (bird-of-paradise) has a shape larger than a sparrow, with long feathers on both wings and tail, appearing as if wearing a straw raincoat. Its color is green with a lustrous shine, making it a rare bird.
○The Hiyoku-no-tori (literally "paired-wing bird") is also written as "比翼鳥." It is said that male and female fly with their wings side by side. No one has been heard to have actually seen this bird.

○The Waikei (bantam chicken) is abundant in the
Jiangnan region of China. Its body is
small and its legs are only
about two inches long.
○The Uso (bullfinch) is smaller than a sparrow,
with beautiful patterns in its feather colors. Its belly is
white underneath, making it a beautiful
bird.
○The Tsubame (swallow) is about the size
of a sparrow. It holds mud in its mouth to build nests under the eaves
of houses. It is said to avoid
the day of Tsuchinoe-mi.
○Hato (dove/pigeon) is a general term with many
varieties. What is illustrated here is commonly
called Juzukake, also known as Hachiman
dove. The area around its neck is
black, resembling wearing
prayer beads. Its feather color is grayish-white, and the Funashi
people do not catch this dove.

come out to villages. Its feather color is greenish-brown.
When eaten, it supplements
bodily weakness and invigorates the blood.

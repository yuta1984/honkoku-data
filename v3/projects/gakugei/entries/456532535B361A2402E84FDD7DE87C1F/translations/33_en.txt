An envoy reaches the frontier

With a single carriage wanting to inquire about the border, passing the vassal state beyond Juyan. The征 tumbleweed emerges from the Han frontier, returning geese enter the barbarian sky. In the great desert, lone smoke rises straight; along the long river, the setting sun is round. At Xiao Pass I meet a scout on patrol; the Protector General is at Yanran.

Becoming an envoy to investigate the surrender of the barbarians (foreign tribes), I reach the frontier region. With only a few attendants and riding in a single, unadorned carriage, I seek to inquire about the situation at the border. Passing through vassal territories and beyond Juyan Castle, my journey is like tumbleweed scattering aimlessly as I depart from the Han fortress. Just as the returning geese, I enter the barbarian sky. A single column of smoke from a desert encampment rises straight up, and when I reach the Long River, the setting sun appears perfectly round as it sets. There at Xiao Pass I encounter a scout, so I ask "Where has the Protector General set up camp?" He replies, "At the foot of Yanran Mountain." I surmise it must still be far from here. The great desert refers to the sandy wasteland, which is barbarian territory.

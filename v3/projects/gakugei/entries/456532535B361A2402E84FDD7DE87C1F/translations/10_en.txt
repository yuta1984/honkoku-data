Attending a Banquet at Princess Changning's Eastern Estate
Li Qiao

The separate estate overlooks the green fields, the sounding carriage bells descend from purple skies. On the long banquet mat gather mandarin ducks and herons, to immortal pipes phoenixes harmonize. Trees connect to nearby Southern Mountain, mist contains the distant northern islet. Receiving grace, all are already drunk; cherishing the beauty, we have yet to turn our bridles homeward.

Attending a Banquet at Princess Changning's Eastern Estate　Li Qiao
The separate estate overlooks green fields, sounding bells descend from purple skies. On the long banquet mat mandarin ducks and herons gather, to immortal pipes phoenixes harmonize. Trees connect closely to Southern Mountain, mist contains the distant northern islet. Receiving grace all are already drunk, cherishing the beauty we have yet to turn our bridles.

According to the New Book of Tang, Princess Changning was the daughter of Emperor Zhongzong and became the wife of Yang Shen. This villa overlooks a village to the east where vegetation grows luxuriantly green, and because the scenery is beautiful, the princess rides in her carriage with ringing bells, descending from above the clouds. At the wide banquet seating, guests gather in proper order like yuan and lu birds (large ones first, small ones following) flying in formation. When playing the xiao flute, it sounds like phoenix voices and the melody harmonizes well. Because it concerns a princess, this alludes to the story of Nongyu. Because the princess's husband Yang Shen also comes, it speaks metaphorically of male and female phoenixes. The garden scenery connects to the distant Southern Mountain, drawing it close before our eyes so it appears nearby. The trailing mist contains the nearby northern islet, making it appear distant. Though Southern Mountain is outside, it's called near; though the northern islet flows into the garden, it's called distant. The two characters "near" and "distant" are not used carelessly. Receiving the princess's gracious command that all should drink wine, everyone has already become intoxicated, but being moved by this scenery and deeply impressed by her thoughtfulness, we are reluctant to leave this beauty and have no heart to mount our horses, sound our bridles, and return home - thus we express our gratitude and speak of our hearts remaining attached to the garden's beauty.

Seeing Off a Friend

Green mountains stretch across the northern ramparts, white waters flow around the eastern city. Once we part in this place, like withered tumbleweeds you journey ten thousand li away.

A traveler's heart is like floating clouds, at sunset I feel affection for my old friend. Waving hands as you depart from here, even the horses part with lonely neighing.

[Commentary]
No matter how spectacular the mountain and water scenery, if one lives in that place and views it daily, it becomes ordinary and uninteresting. The green mountains stretching across the northern ramparts and the white water flowing around the eastern city—this scenery that I normally paid no attention to suddenly catches my eye today as I bid farewell to my friend. I wonder why you must leave, abandoning this beautiful landscape.

In this lovely place we part once, and like withered mugwort scattered by the wind, you journey to distant lands ten thousand li away. Like floating clouds drifting aimlessly, a traveler's heart must be filled with sorrow. During the lonely hours of sunset, I wonder where you might be lodging now—my feelings for an old friend will not be forgotten.

All Chinese people, when parting, grasp each other's hands to show their reluctance to separate. As I wave my hand and you depart from here, the scene becomes melancholy, and even the horses going their separate ways east and west are neighing. Horses have no tears to cry, but in truth it is I who am weeping.

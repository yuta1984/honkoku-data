Meeting Someone Returning to Yuyang North of Muling Pass - Liu Changqing

I met you on the road at Muling, riding a single horse toward Sanggan. The azure mountains of Chu remain ancient and unchanged, while Youzhou feels cold even in broad daylight. After a hundred battles, the city and land are devastated - how many homes of the elderly remain? Everywhere artemisia and weeds grow thick, and the returning traveler covers his tears as he looks upon the scene.

You met this person on the road north of Muling Pass, riding a single horse toward Sanggan. The azure mountains of Muling in Chu state remain ancient and unchanged, but Youzhou's Yuyang, where you are headed, is the place where An Lushan began his rebellion and started the war. Now its ruins are completely desolate, feeling cold even in broad daylight. The castle and moats, after countless battles, have left few homes of the elderly standing. Everywhere, artemisia weeds grow thick like a wilderness, so you, the returning traveler, will cover your tears with a cloth as you look upon this scene.

Seeing off Xing Guizhou

The clanging music is noisy at Jingkou, wind and waves descend to Dongting. Zheqi faces the red cliffs, striking the waves and again raising the boat's awning.
The sun sets and the rivers and lakes turn white, the tide comes and heaven and earth turn blue. The bright pearls return to Hepu, they should follow the star of the imperial envoy.

When Master Xing departs for his post in Guizhou, his retainers board the ship from Jingkou with gongs and flutes, making a lively racket. The wind and waves are calm as they sail down toward the castle town of Dongting Lake. From aboard the ship, they point out Zheqi where Sun Quan of Wu once encamped, and Red Cliff Mountain, talking as they pass below the mountain, striking the waves with oars, keeping rhythm, and opening the boat's windows to view the scenery. Around Zheqi the sun sets, so the waters of rivers and lakes appear white across the vista. When passing below Red Cliff Mountain, the tide rises and heaven and earth become one continuous expanse of deep blue. When Master Xing arrives and governs well, the bright pearls that moved to other lands will return to Hepu to become the people's livelihood. Since Guizhou is the ancient Hepu, the stars will provide protection and follow the imperial envoy Xing, and those bright pearls will not be outdone but will chase after his footsteps and return as well. This is a poem composed by balancing pearls and stars. The historical precedent is that when Hepu has a good magistrate, the pearls return.

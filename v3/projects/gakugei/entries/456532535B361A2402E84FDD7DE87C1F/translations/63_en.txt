"Song of the Barbarian Reed Pipe" by Wang Changling

South of the castle, the barbarians have already gathered; in one night they surround us in multiple layers. Naturally the golden reed pipe sounds, skillfully making the "Departing the Frontier" melody fly forth. Listening while facing the moon at the pass is painful; the clear sound enters the sea wind, faint and subtle. Playing three times at dawn from the high tower, the barbarian people cover their tears and return home.

South of the castle, the enemy forces had already gathered and surrounded us in multiple layers throughout the night. At such a time, the melody of "Departing the Frontier" rang out beautifully across the air. When one listens to it, it sounds painful because it evokes "Moon over the Pass at the Border Mountains." The clear tone enters the "Sea Wind" melody and can be heard faintly. The tune was played three times anew at dawn from the high tower, but even the fierce barbarian warriors shed tears, covered their faces with cloths, and returned home.

"The Rear Zen Courtyard of Broken Mountain Temple" by Chang Jian

On a clear morning I enter an ancient temple; the early sun illuminates the tall forest. The winding path leads to a secluded place; the zen quarters are deep with flowering trees. The mountain light delights the birds' nature; the pond's reflection empties the human heart. All sounds here are together quiet; only the sound of bells and chimes is heard.

Broken Mountain Temple is located in Changshu County, a zen monastery in the remote mountains. On a clear morning when I entered the ancient temple, the morning sun rose and illuminated the tall forest. Turning this way and that along the small path, I reached a deep, secluded place where flowering trees grow thickly around the zen quarters. The morning sunlight illuminates the mountains, and birds fly about according to their nature, chirping joyfully. The reflection of the pond water is so clear that it has washed away and emptied the human heart of the impure and troublesome things of this noisy world. "Wanlai" refers to the various sounds made when the wind blows, but here one is far from human clamor, and all such sounds have receded into silence. The only thing that can be heard is the sound of bells and chimes struck during sutra recitation before the Buddha.

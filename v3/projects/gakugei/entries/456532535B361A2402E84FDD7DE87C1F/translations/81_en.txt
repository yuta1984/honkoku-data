While in Guangzhou, hearing that two censors, Mr. Cui and Mr. Ma, both ascended to the chancellor's platform　by Su Weidao

The herons barely take flight on this day. The migrating oriole can be heard from afar. Together they wait for the water clock at Mingguang Hall, each clearing the clouds for imperial review.
They rejoice in gaining promotion from the court, yet lament the division of duties in the high offices. The old forest cherishes the cypress's joy, while newly grasped orchids create fragrant barriers.
Removing their caps, the divine ram's shadow departs; carriages welcome flocks of auspicious pheasants. From beyond the Southern Dipper afar, they gaze toward the constellation patterns from distance.

【Modern Translation and Commentary】
This is a poem sent in celebration when the author heard that two censors, Mr. Cui and Mr. Ma, had been promoted to the chancellor's offices while he was serving in the southern prefecture of Guangzhou.

The "vibrating herons" (群れを成すサギ) fly in beautiful formation with larger ones leading and smaller ones following. Just as these two men once flew together like these herons in modest positions, they have now achieved promotion and changed roles like orioles moving to tall trees, which the author heard about from his distant location.

Now they serve as Palace Secretaries and Court Gentlemen in the chancellor's offices, stationed at Mingguang Hall to draft imperial edicts, both waiting together for the sixth hour water clock. In preparing documents for imperial review, each clears away clouds to glimpse the white sun, directly paying homage to the dragon countenance of the emperor.

Important appointments require consultation between the emperor and chancellor in the court halls. The author rejoices that his two colleagues have been summoned and elevated by the court. However, he laments that they must serve in separate offices - one in Luan Terrace, the other in Feng Palace.

People from their old workplace, like cypresses rejoicing when pines flourish in winter, celebrate that these promotions came from within their own censor ranks rather than from outside offices. The newly grasped orchids in their hands create a fragrant barrier that distances them from old colleagues who can no longer approach them casually.

Gone are the caps of their censorship days and the fearsome shadow of the divine ram (symbol of judicial authority). Now as court officials riding in carriages to the palace, auspicious pheasants flock to escort them, like the legendary sighting during Han dynasty.

From my distant position beyond the Southern Dipper constellation, I gaze toward the stellar patterns near the Celestial Emperor's throne, envying their positions as court officials. The parallel use of Southern Dipper and constellation patterns is skillfully crafted.

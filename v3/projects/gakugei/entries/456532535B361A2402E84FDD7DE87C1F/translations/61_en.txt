"Gazing upon the Qin River Plain" by Li Qi

The morning view of the Qin River plain stretches far into the distance, with the sun rising from the eastern peak. The mountains and rivers, both near and far, appear pure and clean, while the winding city walls and palaces layer upon one another. The autumn wind sounds through the bamboo of ten thousand households, and the cold-colored pines of the Five Tombs stand solemnly. The traveler has sighs of longing to return home, as the frost and dew fall thick and penetrating cold.

The Qin River plain refers to the capital (Chang'an). Looking out in the early morning, one can see far into the distance. The morning sun emerges and shines from the true eastern peak. The mountains and rivers both far and near appear clean and pure because of the clear weather, and the long-stretching city walls and palaces of the capital appear layered one upon another. The sound of the autumn wind echoes against the bamboo planted at the many houses throughout the capital. The tombs of the five Han dynasty emperors appear cold and desolate with their thick pine groves. Now there is a lament of wanting to return to one's hometown. This is because as the frost and dew fall thick enough to make one shiver with cold, the days and months continue to pass by.

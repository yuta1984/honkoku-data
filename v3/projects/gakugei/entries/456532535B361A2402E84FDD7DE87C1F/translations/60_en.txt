"Traveling Sentiments in Jiangnan" by Zu Yong

The mountains of Chu stretch endlessly, and the homeward path is nothing but desolate. Though the sea appears clear, I see rain falling; at night I hear the river's sound and the tide's flow.
My sword remains near the Southern Dipper constellation, while letters are entrusted to the north wind and sent to distant places. I wish to report about the oranges of the empty pools, but there is no intermediary to send them to Luoqiao.

This poem was composed by Zu Yong when he left the state of Chu, briefly went to Wu, and then returned to Chu. The mountain path returning to the Chu kingdom seems endless, and the homeward journey is simply lonely and desolate. The sea's appearance is bright and clear, yet intermittent showers show signs of rain. The sound of the river water is drowned out by other noises during the day, but when night falls and all becomes quiet, one can hear the echoing sound of the surging tide. With a sword at my waist, I remain in a place near the Southern Dipper constellation, and I entrust letters to the north wind to send them to distant places. I somehow want to send word - the oranges around the empty pools of Wu and Chu are a famous local product, so I wish to send them to Luoqiao in the north, but there is no one to serve as an intermediary and help with this task. In truth, this laments the inconveniences of living in a foreign land. The character "寄" (send) appears twice; one instance may be a copying error.

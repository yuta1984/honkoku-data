Ascending the Sōji Pavilion　　　　　　Cen Shen

The high pavilion approaches the heavens, ascending close to the edge of the sun. When clear, the trees of ten thousand homes open to view, sorrowfully I gaze upon the smoke of the five imperial tombs.
Outside the balustrade, the Qin Ridge hangs low; within the window, the Wei River appears small. Had I known the principle of purity early, I would always wish to serve the Golden Immortal (Buddha).

[Commentary]
Sōji is the translated term for dhāraṇī, a word from Buddhist texts. It refers to a temple pavilion. This high pavilion rises so high it approaches the six heavens of the desire realm, the eighteen heavens of the form realm, and the eight heavens of the formless realm, making it close to the imperial palace. When the clouds clear and it becomes peaceful, one can see the various neighborhoods and trees of the capital, but what is sorrowful is seeing the smoke trailing from the tombs of the five dynasties of the Former Han. Because the pavilion is so high, Mount Zhongnan extending beyond the balustrade appears low, and the Wei River in the capital, visible from far away through the window, appears small. If one were a bit younger and could understand the principle of pure detachment from the world, one would wish to serve the Golden Immortal (Buddha) throughout life.
Qin Ridge refers to Mount Zhongnan.

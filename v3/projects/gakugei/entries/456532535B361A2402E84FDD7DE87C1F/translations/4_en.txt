should not have even a single poem added or removed, but it cannot be helped. Since we kept what was initially carved and are now collecting the remainder, this greatly goes against the intention of the original collection. Therefore, on behalf of the master of the publishing house Suzanbo, I offer this explanation. Moreover, following the practice of previous publications, although we provide brief explanations of the general meaning of each poem, for more detailed matters, there are various annotated editions by distinguished scholars available in Suzanbo's book catalog, so readers who consult these will be able to grasp the finer points of interpretation.

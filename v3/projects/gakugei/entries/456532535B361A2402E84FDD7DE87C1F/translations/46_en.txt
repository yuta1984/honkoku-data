Spending the Night at the Left Ministry in Spring

Flowers hide behind the palace walls as evening falls, chirping birds returning to roost pass by. Stars look down upon ten thousand households and move, the moon beside the nine heavens shines abundantly. Unable to sleep, I listen for the golden keys; with the wind I imagine the jade horse ornaments. Tomorrow morning I have a sealed memorial; repeatedly I ask what time of night it is.

While staying at the Left Ministry (government office), the flowers can no longer be seen and the palace walls grow dark with evening. Birds chirping as they return to their roosts pass by. As night falls, starlight shines down on the doorway and flickers. This also implies that when the ruler's governance is poor, the stars move restlessly. The moon is close to the nine layers of heaven, and its light fills everywhere abundantly. Since I have matters to report to the emperor tomorrow morning, I must not sleep. Therefore I stay awake listening to the sound of the palace gate keys. Also, with each sound of the wind, I strain my ears imagining the jingling of jade ornaments on the horses of officials coming to court. This is because tomorrow morning I must write my opinions in a sealed memorial to present to the throne, so throughout the night I repeatedly ask my subordinates: "What time of night is it now?"

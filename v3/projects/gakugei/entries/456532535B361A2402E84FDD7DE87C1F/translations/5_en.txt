"Following the Army"　　　　　　　　　　Yang Jiong

Beacon fires illuminate the Western Capital, and hearts are naturally unpeaceful. Taking the ceremonial jade tablet, [the general] bids farewell to the Phoenix Palace, and iron cavalry surrounds Dragon City. Snow darkens and withers the painted banners, much wind mingles with the sound of drums. Rather become a captain of a hundred men than remain a single scholar.

"Following the Army" refers to when barbarians from the frontier attempt to invade the capital, so large military forces are sent to defend it. When defending vigilantly with those troops, fires are lit at night and smoke signals during the day with various reports. People's hearts are unsettled even to the Western Capital. The court grants a ceremonial jade tablet to the general and dispatches him for conquest. This refers to taking leave from the Phoenix Palace (imperial palace) and departing. Iron cavalry (armored horsemen) follow the general and surround the Xiongnu's Dragon City. In barbarian lands, cold comes early, and since snow falls from around the ninth month, it becomes dark, and cold winds blow that seem to wither and fade the paintings on the banners held by the general's forces, while the sound of drums meant to encourage the troops mingles chaotically. If one achieves merit, one can even become a feudal lord, so even becoming a captain of a hundred men is better than being one of us scholars. The seventh and eighth lines contain the sentiment of resentment at one's talents not being utilized.

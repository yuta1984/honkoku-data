Seeing off Judge Hei Tanzen

Not knowing the road to Yang Pass, newly following the Marquis of Dingyuan. Yellow clouds cut off the spring scenery, painted horns stir border sorrows.
The Vast Sea brings years of separation, flowing out from the fortress of Jiaohe. One must make foreign envoys know of drinking from the Yuezhi chief's head.

Hei Tanzen becomes a judge and goes to the barbarian lands. Though he doesn't know the road to Yang Pass, he newly follows a general who could be called the Marquis of Dingyuan. However, when he reaches the barbarian lands, the climate will be different from the capital - there will be only yellow snow clouds and no spring scenery at all. Moreover, when the unfamiliar sound of painted horns makes its mournful voice, the sorrow of being at the frontier will arise and become unbearable. Furthermore, it becomes a separation lasting years in the Vast Sea, and since it's so far away flowing out from the Jiaohe fortress, even letters cannot reach. "須らく" means something that must necessarily be done. When envoys come from foreign countries, one must let them know about cutting off the head of the Yuezhi king and using it as a wine cup to drink from, just as in the Former Han period. If you're really going, you should achieve military merit. Ban Chao of the Later Han made fifty-odd western barbarian states surrender, and due to that great achievement, he was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Dingyuan.

Lodging at the Pavilion of Yunmen Temple - Sun Di

The fragrant pavilion lies beneath the eastern mountain. The misty flowers are secluded beyond the phenomenal world. Hanging lanterns in the evening of a thousand peaks, rolling up curtains in the autumn of five lakes. On painted walls remain wild geese, at gauze windows lodge the Dipper and Ox constellations. Further suspecting the heavenly path is near, in dreams I wander with white clouds.

Yunmen Temple is located in Zhejiang, and all temple buildings are called by adding the character "fragrant." This fragrant pavilion is located at the base of the temple's eastern mountain. The scenery of mist and flowers is profound, separated from the mundane world. As night falls and they light the lamps in the high pavilion, when lanterns are hung, even the thousand peaks become quiet in the evening scene. "Zhang" refers to mountains that are like folding screens. When the curtains are rolled up and one looks out, the autumn scenery of the five lakes can be seen spread out. Speaking of the temple's antiquity, the wild geese painted on the walls have become old and fragmented, which is called "remaining." Speaking of the pavilion's height, near the paper windows covered with gauze fabric, the stars of Dipper and Ox, which correspond to this region's celestial division, appear to lodge there. What seems suspicious is that the path leading up to Indra's Heaven, Tushita Heaven, and the Thirty-three Heavens appears to be nearby, so after staying one night and falling asleep, I dreamed that white clouds came to welcome me and I wandered in heaven together with the clouds.

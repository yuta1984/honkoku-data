Contemplating the Past at White Emperor City - Chen Zi'ang

The sun sets on the evening of the Cang River, stopping the oar to inquire about the local scenery. The city overlooks the State of Ba Zi, while the terrace has sunk into the Han King's palace. The frontier lands still remain Zhou territory, and the deep mountains still bear Yu's achievements. Rocks hang suspended where blue cliffs are severed, and through the treacherous terrain the jade-green current flows. Ancient trees grow amid the clouds, while returning sails emerge from the mist. The river's path extends without limit, so why should a traveler's thoughts ever cease?

[Commentary]
The author was from Shu, and at this time was traveling by boat to Chu, passing through here from the Three Gorges when he composed this poem and "Contemplating the Past at Mount Xian." The sun set in the west and the Cang River became evening, and though his heart was eager to proceed, because there were so many historic sites in this landscape, he had the boatman temporarily stop the oar, and there he inquired extensively about the local scenery. The reply was: "What the castle overlooks is the State of Ba Zi. The terrace has disappeared, but this is the site of Yong'an Palace where Liu Bei, called the Han King, resided." Remote places are called "wild domains." This Zhou territory is not mentioned in the "Yu Gong" (Tribute of Yu), but is simply called Zhou land. Though this area is remote, it is still Zhou territory. The water flowing at the foot of the deep mountains shows that Yu's achievements still remain visible. The two characters "reng" (still) and "shang" (yet) were carefully chosen words, revealing deep emotion. Now, being wild domain and deep mountains, rocks hang high like blue walls, broken through the middle, and the jade current flows through this treacherous terrain, making the water swift. Ancient trees grow luxuriantly among the clouds. When sails are raised on the returning boat, because the area between the Three Gorges is dark, it emerges through the mist. Though the river's path extends endlessly into the distance without limit, why should the feelings of contemplating antiquity while traveling naturally ever be exhausted?

Imperial Progress to Shu, Arriving at Sword Gate in the West - Emperor Xuanzong

The Sword Pavilion stretches across the clouds, steep and treacherous. The imperial carriage returns from the hunting expedition. Green screens join for a thousand fathoms, cinnabar cliffs open where five strong men worked. Shrubs entangle the banners as they turn, immortal clouds sweep past and brush the horses. Success in one's time truly lies in virtue. Alas, what talent to inscribe this inscription!

The Sword Pavilion Mountain of Shu lies in the sky, stretching across above the clouds, steep and treacherous. Summoned in a carriage with jingling bells, the emperor tours the region of Shu and returns. Mountains as high as a thousand fathoms are connected like erected green folding screens. The cliffs with red stones were where five strong young men in ancient times opened a road and created a mountain pass, but the mountain path is narrow, blocked by flourishing trees, with banners entangled and winding here and there. Clouds rising from the mountains come sweeping past the imperial horse's nose. At this place, Zhang Zai of the Jin dynasty erected a stone monument, which the emperor graciously viewed. In the inscription it says, "Success in governing the world in one's time lies in virtue; strategic strongholds, however fortified, are ultimately fragile." The emperor was deeply moved and praised the talent of carving this inscription in stone. "Alas" (sajisu) expresses deep emotion. "Clouds stretching across" (hengyun) or "immortal clouds" (xianyun) - one of these is an error, as the character for "cloud" appears twice in the poem. This refers to when Emperor Xuanzong fled to Shu during An Lushan's rebellion, and after the rebellion was quelled and he returned to the capital, it was described as going out on a hunt. It is said that young men over twenty are called "ding," so "five ding" means five men.

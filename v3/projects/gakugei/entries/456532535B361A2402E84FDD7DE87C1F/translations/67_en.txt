Hearing the Flute　　　　Zhang Xun

From the high tower, I try to look down once - enemy cavalry swarm like ants in the shadow of the castle. Unable to discern the state of war and dust, how can one know the heart of Heaven and Earth? With the gate open, the frontier moon draws near; the battle is bitter, and clouds hang deep over the encampment. Morning and evening on the watchtower above, I hear the distant sound of the horizontal flute.

[Commentary]
Looking down from a high place, enemy forces gather like ants near the castle walls. The course of the battle chaos cannot be discerned. Since the order and disorder of the realm are matters of Heaven and Earth, in such turmoil how can one know the heart of Heaven and Earth? Though Suiyang is not a frontier fortress, with the gates open it seems as if the melancholy moon of the borderlands shines upon it. The battle goes poorly for the imperial forces, provisions are exhausted, and the suffering of starvation approaches, so clouds sorrowfully envelop the encampment deeply. From the watchtower where guards take turns ascending morning and evening to observe enemy movements, what can be heard in the distance is the sad sound of the horizontal flute echoing. This poem expresses the emotion of hearing the flute in each line, revealing the character for "flute" in the final line. I believe this was a poem composed by Zhang Xun before his death in battle.

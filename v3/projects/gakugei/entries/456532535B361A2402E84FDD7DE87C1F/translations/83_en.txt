A Court Poem Offered in Response to the Imperial Visit to Wei Sizhi's Mountain Villa - by Li Qiao

In Nanluuo dwells one worthy of the bond with minister-teachers; at Eastern Crag resides one who assists the king. Due to profound sentiment, court ranks are forgotten; imperial favor watches over hermits like woodcutters and fishermen.

An edict descends and the imperial procession to Dong Mountain is arranged; grace turns the imperial carriage from Ba River. At the pine gate, banners and canopies are stationed; into the ivy pavilion, officials wearing court caps are led.

Stone steps are level like the celestial path; smoky towers reach halfway to purple void. Clouds and mist rise near the immortal path; with qin and wine, worldly dust grows distant.

Tall trees exceed a thousand years in age; hanging springs cascade over a hundred zhang. In deep cliff recesses, medicines were once refined; in ancient caves, books have long been stored.

Birds roosting in trees soar against the wind; fish lurking in pools swim freely through valleys. How can one know the nobility of the Son of Heaven? Still one recalls the Martial Marquis's hut.

[Commentary]
The mountain villa in Nanluoo belongs to Wei Sizhi, who is worthy of being a minister-teacher like Yi Yin or Duke of Qi. Even residing at Eastern Crag, it is the dwelling of Sizhi who assists the Son of Heaven, so the emperor also delights in this landscape's profound sentiment and, forgetting court ranks, makes an imperial visit. An edict descends for the emperor to visit Sizhi, who lives like a woodcutter or fisherman, and the imperial procession is arranged to visit Sizhi's place, like Guangchengzi residing at Dong Mountain. The imperial grace turns the carriage from Ba River east of Chang'an to make the visit. Being a mountain villa, a gate is temporarily built of pine trees, and within it banners and canopies are stationed, ivy pavilions are erected, and court officials wearing caps and long robes are led inside.

Stone steps and such become celestial paths when the Son of Heaven visits, made level and beautiful. Smoky towers also become the emperor's quarters with the forbidden palace half-appearing. Clouds and mist also rise near the immortal path where the Son of Heaven visits, and through playing the qin and drinking wine, the clamorous affairs of worldly dust become distant.

From here below, the ancient character of the mountain villa is described. The tall trees that have endured through years and months seem to have surpassed a thousand years, and the waterfall cascading from the rocks extends over a hundred zhang. Being a mountain villa inherited from ancestors, it appears ancient, and in the deep mountain cliffs, places where medicines were once refined can be seen. One imagines that immortals once dwelled there, and the caves in the mountains are thought to be places where books were stored in ancient times.

Praising Sizhi, the birds roosting in the thick trees might be the great roc that soars against the wind across ninety thousand li, and there are fish in the pool waters that swim freely through valleys. Using this metaphor, Sizhi's great capacity is praised. Here, bestowing grace upon Sizhi, it is said: How could one know? The present Son of Heaven is naturally born as emperor, so he is naturally noble. Like Liu Bei, who rose from humble origins to become emperor, he visited the Martial Marquis's hut three times, but the present emperor, even if you are like the Martial Marquis, has no need to employ anyone, so he need not think of your hut.

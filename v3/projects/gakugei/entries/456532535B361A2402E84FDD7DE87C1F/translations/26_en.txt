[Seal: "Shoken"]
Mount Zhongnan
　　　　Wang Wei

Taiyi is near the heavenly capital, the connected mountains reach to the corners of the sea. White clouds converge when I turn back to look, blue mist disappears when I gaze intently. The territorial divisions change at the central peak, shadow and sunshine differ in the many valleys. Wishing to find lodging where people dwell, I call across the water to ask a woodcutter.

Seeing Off the Buddhist Monks Kōkei, Dōshun, and Genshō Returning to Jingzhou　By Imperial Command

The One Vehicle returns to the Pure Realm, ten thousand cavalry bid farewell at the broad avenue. Though close to the sun, the farewell pavilion is near, yet crossing heaven, the parting road is long. In southern Jing they turn with staff and bowl, north of the Wei River the ferry and bridge are the limit. On what day will they don the True Fruit and return again to enter the Imperial Capital?

Shamon is a word from India, translated as "diligent rest" - being diligent in good and ceasing evil. Ōsei means composing poetry upon receiving an imperial edict. Ichijō (One Vehicle) is a term from the Expedient Means chapter of the Lotus Sutra. Three monks ride in one carriage, and there is a pure realm in Jingzhou to which they return. By the Emperor's command, many mounted retainers are to come out as far as the broad avenue before the palace gates to bid farewell. "Sun" is a metaphor for the Emperor - though they approach close to the Emperor and the farewell pavilion is near, crossing to heaven makes the parting road long. Because they return to southern Jing carrying staff and bowl, the capital north of the Wei River becomes ferry and bridge. The salvation of all beings has these as its limits. Because the Wei River is mentioned, "ferry and bridge" are cleverly worked together. True Fruit refers to the attainment of Buddhahood. On what day will they don the Buddha-fruit and return to enter the Imperial Capital? In this poem, either "approaching the sun" or "what day" contains an error - there are two instances of the character for "day."

Entering Juyong Pass as an Envoy to the Qingyi Army

Traveling on a single horse, evening is about to fall. Hastening along the campaign route, the journey becomes increasingly difficult. Not knowing how the borderland changes, I only wonder at how thin my traveling clothes have become.

The valley is cold and the sound of springs is bitter, the mountains are desolate and the leaves are dry. Do not say that the mountain passes have reached their most treacherous point—rain and snow still continue endlessly.

The Qingyi Army refers to a military camp that accepts the surrender of barbarian tribes. This poem was composed when traveling there as an envoy and passing through Juyong Pass. With few attendants, riding on a single horse, evening is about to fall. Though hurrying along the campaign route, there are increasingly difficult places ahead. Since I pass through similarly treacherous terrain day after day, even after many days I cannot discern the changes in this borderland. What I do notice is that my traveling clothes have become strangely thin and tattered, but after traveling for so many days, my garments have naturally worn out. The valley streams are cold, and the sound of springs rings out mournfully. The mountains are desolate and the leaves are dry. Words cannot fully describe it all—do not say this is where the mountain passes reach their limit. The path ahead still has falling snow that continues endlessly—what a trying ordeal.

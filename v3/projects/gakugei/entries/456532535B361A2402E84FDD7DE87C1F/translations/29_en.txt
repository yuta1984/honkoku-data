Climbing to Bengaku Temple

The bamboo path follows from the initial ground, the lotus peak brings forth the transformation city. From the window the three Chu regions are exhausted, beyond the forest the Nine Rivers lie flat.
Tender grass supports the cross-legged sitting, tall pines resound with Buddhist chanting. Dwelling in emptiness beyond the dharma clouds, observing the world I have attained the unborn.

Since there is no place name for this temple, I cannot identify it from this poem, but considering it, it must be a temple located in the Chu region. There is a path where bamboo groves grow, and there is an entrance gate there, which is called the "initial ground." Gradually climbing up, there is a main hall on a lotus-like peak. Looking out from this high place, through the window of the room, the entire Chu country can be seen stretching across the three directions of east, south, and west. Looking beyond the forest, the winding Nine Rivers and Dongting Lake appear calm and flat. In the garden, tender grass grows as if with consciousness, serving like cushions to support the cross-legged meditation posture of the monks. The wind blowing through the tall, towering pines sounds as if the voices of sutra and dharani chanting are echoing. Borrowing the Buddhist term "dwelling in emptiness," here one forgets the world and remains in a state of no-thought and no-mind, which seems to represent attaining the great enlightenment called "patience with the unborn dharma" among the dharma clouds—transcending the world and clarifying the mind.

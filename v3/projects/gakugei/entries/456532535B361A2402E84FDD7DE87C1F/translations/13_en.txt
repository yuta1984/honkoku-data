Returning to arrive at Tanzhou Station - the place where I previously parted from Gao Liu

The old inn was at the mouth of Fenjiang. Forlornly I gaze upon the setting sun. Meeting together we shared travelers' meals, facing parting we exchanged traveling clothes. The mountains and rivers I once recorded are still here, now I grieve that human generations are no more. Coming and going all use this same road. Life and death do not share the same destination.

Tanzhou is the place where Zhang Yue parted from Gao Liu when he was demoted to Yuezhou, and this poem was composed in grief over Gao Liu's death. Gao is the surname, his given name was Jian, and Liu (six) indicates his birth order among brothers. The old lodging they rented was at the entrance to Fenjiang. This year I was permitted to return to the capital and could return alive, but Gao Liu has died. Even normally the twilight hour is melancholy, and now I sadly gaze upon the scene of the setting sun. In the past when we met here, we would pass inn food from hand to hand and eat together. Because our destinations in exile were different, when facing our parting we exchanged clothing, promising to remember each other day and night. The mountains and rivers I saw remain the same as they were then, but what is sorrowful is how human generations pass and change. Whether parting or returning, it is all the same road, yet Gao Liu has died while I live on, unable even to return to the capital.

Seeing Off Liu the Proofreader Who Follows the Army - by Yang Jiong

The Son of Heaven descends from the Three Palaces, and the Star Gate arrays the Five Troops. Sitting in counsel aids temple strategies, and dispatching proclamations awaits literary heroes. The Meteor Sword forged with red earth, the Crow-call Bright Moon bow. Autumn's yin energy arises on the Shu Road, and killing intent encircles Huangzhong. In what year will this parting of wind and rain be? Qin and wine jar shared this day. From the parting pavilion one cannot gaze, as the ditch water naturally flows west and east.

[Commentary]
"Heavenly General" refers to when the Son of Heaven grants a seal to a general and commands him to go suppress rebels somewhere. The "Three Palaces" refers to the Bright Hall (Mingtang), Circular Moat (Biyong), and Spirit Platform (Lingtai), representing the imperial court. They fortify the gates leading northwest from the capital and array the five types of military equipment. When sitting together to plan strategy, this assists the temple strategies discussed within the imperial shrine.

Since military proclamations can cause misunderstandings if the writing is poor, they await someone skilled in literature to write them, which is why you have been summoned.

Your martial departure is described thus: you carry the famous Meteor Sword with a stellar blade forged with red earth, and bear the bow called Crow-call, which when fully drawn becomes round like the bright moon. Autumn brings yin energy that withers plants, and similarly this autumn gloom will arise when traveling the Shu Road. Due to military affairs, deadly energy will surround and encircle Huangzhong in Shu. Like wind blowing and rain scattering, the separation will last for years.

Another interpretation suggests that when you reach the army camp and encounter lonely times of wind and rain, you will remember in what year we parted. Now we play the qin and share wine jars, briefly enjoying each other's company. Yet another reading asks when we might again enjoy qin and wine together as we do today. After sending off this farewell, one cannot gaze from this parting pavilion, because the ditch water naturally divides and flows west and east - you go to the distant west while I remain in the east, separated, which makes the memory even more poignant.

The "Huangzhong" in the poem's eighth line refers to a region in Shaanxi Lintao during the Ming period. "Temple strategies" refers to secretly discussing plans in ancestral temples so that ancestral spirits may also hear, a practice where both emperors and generals hold consultations in shrines.

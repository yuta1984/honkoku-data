Mount Zhongnan (Shūnanzan)　　　　　　　　　　　　Wang Wei

Taiyi is near the heavenly capital, the connected mountains reach to the sea's edge. When I turn my gaze around, white clouds converge; when I enter close, the blue mist disappears. The territorial divisions change at the central peak, shadow and sunshine differ among the many valleys. Wishing to find lodging at human dwellings, I call across the water to ask a woodcutter.

Mount Zhongnan's other name is Mount Taiyi, and because it is especially high, it is said to be near the heavenly emperor's capital. There is also a theory that because it faces the imperial palace, it is close to the Son of Heaven's capital. The mountains connected at the mountain's base spread their roots to the ends of the seas in all directions. The first line speaks of the mountain's height, the second line speaks of its breadth. Seeing white clouds rising from the mountain peaks and looking back, the clouds merged into one. From afar it appeared blue and densely covering the entire surface, but when I entered close, it disappeared. Because the mountain is vast, even the stars of the twenty-eight lunar mansions that divide the celestial sphere are split left and right and transformed at the center of the peak. There are both cloudy and clear places, with many valleys. Having wandered around finding it so fascinating that evening falls, I think that tonight there must be human settlements or villages in these mountains, and wishing to rely on these for lodging, I called out to a woodcutter passing on the other side of the valley, asking where there might be human dwellings.

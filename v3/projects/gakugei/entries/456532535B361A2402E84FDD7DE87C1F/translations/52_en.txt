Viewing Li Guqing's Inscription on Sima's Landscape Painting

Fangzhang Isle is entirely connected to water, Mount Tiantai is completely reflected in clouds. Humans can only gaze long at paintings; growing old, one resents hearing only empty words.
Fan Li's boat appears particularly small, Wang Qiao's crane does not flock with others. This life follows all things - where might one escape the dust and clamor?

Li is the family name, Guqing is the courtesy name, and Sima is a military administrator. Fangzhang is an island in the sea where immortals dwell, depicted in painting as entirely surrounded by connecting waters. Mount Tiantai is a celestial realm on land, appearing everywhere illuminated by the light of clouds. In human life, one can only gaze long at paintings. While in one's prime years one might practice the immortal way, growing old and only hearing empty words is truly regrettable. Around the waters of Fangzhang, there is a scene of Fan Li withdrawing to the Five Lakes, his boat painted particularly small. In the clouds of Tiantai appears the crane ridden by Prince Wang Qiao of Zhou's King Ling and Jin - this is no ordinary matter. Using the historical allusions of boat and crane to inspire feeling in these seven or eight lines: this life is influenced by wives, children, brothers, and all manner of worldly things, so where might one dwell to escape the dust and clamor? Is this not a lamentable matter?

Song of the Frontier Fortress (Saika no Kyoku) by Li Bai

The barbarians descend in autumn. The heavenly army departs from the Han realm. The general divides the tiger bamboo (tallies), and warriors lie encamped in the Dragon Sands (desert).

The frontier moon follows the shadow of bows, and Hu frost sweeps away sword-flowers. Having not yet entered Jade Gate Pass, young wives should not lament long.

[Commentary]
The frontier fortresses, both upper and lower, all serve to suppress the barbarians in military encampments. In autumn, the barbarians like to launch military attacks on the capital. The barbarian lands are at high elevation, while the capital is low, hence "descending." Since one cannot be careless, the emperor appoints generals, assembles troops, and they leave home to go on campaigns. For the general, they draw a tiger on round bamboo, split it in two - one half given to the general, one half kept by the emperor as matching tallies.

Many warriors also take positions in the barbarians' Dragon Sands (sandy terrain), staying awake day and night, never sleeping as they stand guard. At the frontier, the moon shines together with the shadows of strung bows, and when swords are brandished as if frost falls from the barbarian sky, the light appears like scattered flowers. "Harau" (sweep/brush) means "brandish." Since there are battles even before entering Jade Gate Pass, no one knows what year they will return. Though outwardly we say that young wives waiting in the capital should not lament long and should be resolute, expressing the warrior's strong spirit, inwardly there exists the painful and sorrowful human emotions that are natural.

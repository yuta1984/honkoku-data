Ascending in Autumn to Xie Tiao's North Tower in Xuancheng

The riverside city is like something within a painting. At mountain dawn, one gazes upon the clear sky. Two rivers sandwich a bright mirror, twin bridges drop a colored rainbow. Human smoke makes cold the tangerines and pomelos, autumn colors age the wu-tong trees.

Who would think that atop the north tower, facing the wind, one would fondly remember Lord Xie? [Seal: "Tianzhen"]

[Commentary]
Xie Tiao was a person of the Southern Qi dynasty who became the inner historian (record keeper) of Xuancheng and built the North Tower. The "two rivers" refers to the Wan Creek and Gou Creek whose waters flow around the left and right of Xuancheng. The "twin bridges" are the Phoenix Bridge and the Jichuan Bridge.

Climbing to the North Tower built by the riverside, it appears as if one is within a colored painting. As the mountains greet the dawn and one looks out over the clear sky, the waters of two valley streams flow on the left and right of the city, sandwiching the light of the morning sun—the colorful rainbow appears to have fallen from the sky. Since the land of Chu is a warm region, among the rising smoke from houses, the tangerines and pomelos appear cold, and as the autumn scenery deepens, even the wu-tong trees grow old, creating a lonely scene.

Who would think to look down upon the scenery from the North Tower and nostalgically recall how Lord Xie composed poetry and took pleasure here? It is because I think that even someone like myself could be a match for Lord Xie that I recall him so fondly.

"Ascending Yueyang Tower"

I had long heard tell of the vastness of Dongting Lake's waters, but today I climbed Yueyang Tower and truly saw it spread before me in wonder. The lands of Wu and Chu are split apart to the southeast, and between heaven and earth, various things appear to float day and night, reflected on the water's surface. As I gaze upon this open vista that stretches to the distant horizon, I look toward the direction of the capital, but not even a single letter comes from relatives or friends. In my old age and illness, I have only a solitary boat to rely upon. What misfortune this is! This is because warfare rages north of the passes near the capital, making the world turbulent and preventing my return home. So I lean against the eaves of this tower and let my tears flow freely. The characters "leaning on the eaves" (憑軒) appear in Wang Can's "Rhapsody on Ascending a Tower" in the Wenxuan anthology, making them dear and familiar.

"Having the Same Thoughts as Wang the Reclusive Gentleman at Dongting Lake" by Zhang Wei

In the eighth month, autumn at Dongting Lake; the waters of Xiaoxiang flow northward. A dream of returning home across ten thousand li; as a traveler, the sorrow of the fifth watch. Not using the opening of book cases, it is best to go up to wine towers. Old friends fill the capital; on what day shall we travel together again?

Wang is a surname, and "reclusive gentleman" refers to a person who, even when summoned by the emperor, has no worldly ambitions and does not serve in office, remaining a masterless wanderer. In the eighth month, the water vapor becomes abundant, so the autumn at Dongting appears cool and beautiful as far as the eye can see, and the flow of the two waters of Xiaoxiang appears magnificent. Having stayed long in this place and thinking nostalgically of his hometown, he had a joyful dream of returning to his native place and meeting his wife, children, and relatives. But when he awoke from the dream, he was still the same traveler, and around the seventh hour of the fifth watch, his melancholy increased again. In such sad and painful times, one cannot make use of opening book cases to read. In order to dispel depression, it is better to go up to a tower where wine is sold. Though old friends and companions fill Luoyang, on what day shall we travel together again?

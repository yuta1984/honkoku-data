Lodging at Wenzheng and Gazing at the Military Camp

In the barbarian lands, the cold makes bow glue dry and crack. At the border fortress, the night watchman's wooden clappers can be heard. Military tallies connect to the imperial palace, and the emperor's strategies move the generals.

The fortress is quiet and the sound of barbarian flutes carries through. The sand is brightly lit, and white Chu silk can be seen distinctly. Wind flags flutter like wing shadows, and frost-like swords turn with dragon patterns.

White feathers sway like the moon, and green mountains appear broken like clouds. Sparse smoke seems to roll up tent curtains, and dust disappears as if clearing away evil vapors.

Casting aside the writing brush to remember Ban Chao's achievements, facing battle while thinking of Gu Rong's strategies. Surely the shame of Han will be cleared, and this will be reported to the enlightened ruler.

In barbarian lands, when autumn's yin energy approaches and bow glue dries and cracks, enemies use this as a signal to attack, so border fortress cities must not be careless and continuously beat wooden clappers during night patrols. The military tallies granted by the emperor are half related to the imperial palace and half dispatched to generals, expressing through the character "guan" (relate/concern) the way vassals treasure their lord. When the emperor consults on strategies, his authority transfers to the general who trembles and moves - the character "dong" (move) implies being commanded by the ruler.

Because the general's orders are good, the fortress remains quiet and the sound of barbarian flutes carries across. Moonlight shines bright, making the sandy battlefield clear so that front and rear troops won't be confused - they use identification markers, with white Chu silk sewn on collars and sleeves clearly visible and distinct. When wind blows, the flags lined up show bird paintings with wing shadows fluttering - the character "wing" implies good strategic positioning. Frost-covered swords that send chills turn with dragon patterns - "dragon pattern" implies the fierce majesty of soldiers, and also suggests famous swords that transformed into dragons. Troops bearing white-feathered arrows move back and forth swaying like moonlight, and as they travel around the base of green mountains, the middle appears broken like scattered clouds.

Another interpretation is that Zhuge Liang held a white feather fan commanding three armies - that fan's movement was like the moon. Where troops gathered at the foot of green mountains, the middle section appeared broken with clouds scattered about. Smoke appears sparse and intermittent, as if tent curtains might be rolling up. The weather clears completely, kicked-up dust disappears, and evil military vapors seem to dissipate. At such times, one wants to abandon learning for warfare and achieve merit, so casting aside the brush to yearn for Ban Chao's achievements, facing this battle while contemplating Jin dynasty Gu Rong's strategies.

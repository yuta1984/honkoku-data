　　Notice Regarding Delay in Settlement Payment

【Left Page】
Your letter dated July 28th arrived today and I have read it with respect. As you mentioned, the lingering summer heat is indeed difficult to bear, but I am delighted to hear that you are in increasingly good health. Regarding the matter of settlement before the Bon festival that you instructed us about, your point is entirely reasonable.

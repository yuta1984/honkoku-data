Quick calculation method for coin exchange rates【enclosed in double lines】
For example, when the exchange rate is 9 monme 2 bu 5 rin
Question: How much coin for 1 monme of silver?
　　Answer: 107 mon 5 bu
Calculation method: Set 20 monme as the standard, and subtract
the exchange rate of 9 monme 2 bu 5 rin, leaving
10 monme 7 bu 5 rin, which represents
the remainder per 1 monme, seen as 107 mon 5 bu
This method works without error for any
exchange rate up to 10 monme

Division calculation method using a carpenter's square【enclosed in double lines】
For example, cotton fabric priced at
7 monme 8 bu of silver
per tan, when purchasing
1 jō 5 shaku,
what is the cost?
　Answer: 4 monme 5 bu

【Left Page, Upper Section】
The calculation method is as follows:
Even on soil,
if you simply
draw straight lines,
you can perform
division without
using an abacus

【In the carpenter's square spanning both pages】
1 shaku 5 sun　　Consider this as the length
　　　　　　　　of fabric being purchased
4 sun 5 bu
Consider these 4 sun 5 bu as
the cost of the fabric
being purchased
【Below the long side of the square】
Stock: 2 shaku 6 sun - Length of one tan
【Beside the short side of the square】
Hook: 7 sun 8 bu - Cost of one tan

【Left Page, Upper Section Center】
Using the carpenter's square with the stock side at 2 shaku 6 sun《annotation: this is the number for one tan's length》
and the hook side at 7 sun 8 bu《annotation: this is the number for one tan's cost》,
draw a diagonal line, then place the ruler at 1 shaku 5 sun
《annotation: this is the number for the length of cotton being purchased》on the stock side and measure to where the diagonal passes,
which gives 4 sun 5 bu.
This indicates that the cost of the cotton
being purchased is 4 monme 5 bu of silver.
For any other calculations involving exchange rates,
follow the same method as described above.
Simply mark the measurements on the ruler scale for any calculations.

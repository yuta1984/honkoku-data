　　　　　Preface
All correspondence used in merchant houses should not necessarily adhere strictly to grammar, but should employ language slightly more respectful than one's station warrants, with the primary goal being that business matters are well communicated and reach their destination. Therefore, unfamiliar words or difficult-to-read characters should not be used at all. However, this does not mean that excessively vulgar words or crude characters should be particularly employed either. It is desirable to follow what is appropriate to the time and occasion, keeping the length reasonably short. For these reasons, this book was compiled entirely with this principle in mind, paying careful attention to wording and character usage, and widely collecting and selecting appropriate characters. Though this is but a small booklet, its benefits are vast. It can truly be called the fundamental asset of prosperous merchant families engaged in commerce.
　　Boshin year, 5th month　　　　　　Written respectfully by the Master of Kōbundō

Guidelines for Wedding Ceremonies

Wedding ceremonies are one of the three great ceremonies of human life and represent the most celebratory event in one's lifetime. However, since they are fundamentally for the continuation of offspring, one must never be extravagant. Yet neither should one be overly frugal; it is essential to maintain what is appropriate to one's social status. While the etiquette should have no limits regardless of high or low birth, I shall outline below the essential ceremony that should not be omitted, though kept extremely simple.

The betrothal ceremony represents the beginning of displaying one's social standing, so one should consult thoroughly with the matchmaker to ensure the wedding ceremony is appropriate to one's status without excess or deficiency.

On the day itself, when the bride and groom take their seats, first bring out the three ceremonial cups as a beginning. The groom takes the upper cup first, drinks three times, and passes it to the bride. The bride should also drink three times. Next, serve zoni (New Year's soup), and the bride takes the second cup first, with the couple drinking three times each in turn. Next, serve clear soup, and the groom takes the lower cup first, with both drinking three times each in turn. This completes the san-san-kudo (three-three-nine-times) ceremony.

Then, with the feeling of iro-naoshi (changing clothes), the couple changes their seating arrangement and exchanges cups with relatives from both families. At this time, place a single cup on a small stand and serve it with appetizers. Then serve the formal meal. The bride's portion should be piled high. Next, serve sweets and tea, after which everyone should disperse. Afterward, there should be the toko-sakazuki (bedchamber cup) ceremony. This also uses a single cup placed on a small stand, served with appetizers. At this time, the bride begins by offering the cup to the groom.

Use a ma-nabe (間鍋, a type of pot) instead of choushi (sake server) or hisage (small kettle). Butterfly and flower designs are decorations for the nobility, so lower classes should refrain from using them. One should remember that in all ceremonies, it is considered wrong to transgress one's social boundaries.

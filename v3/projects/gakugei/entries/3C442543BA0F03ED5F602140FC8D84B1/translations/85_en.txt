Miraculous Medicine Formula for Smallpox

When a child suddenly feels chills, suddenly develops fever, stares fixedly, faints two or three times a day, writhes in pain, yawns, becomes startled and agitated, sneezes, has nasal discharge, both jaws become red, and ears hurt - these are signs of smallpox.

Fever onset: 3 days    Rash appearance: 3 days
Pustulation: 3 days    Swelling: 3 days
Recovery: 3 days    Total duration: 15 days

This is the normal duration and proper course of the disease. For severe cases, there may be no limit to the number of days. For extremely mild cases, though they may heal before the aforementioned duration, one should still perform the sake bath ritual and send off the deity on the fifteenth day.

○ Method to prevent smallpox
Pear branches (one bundle, seven pieces)    Plum branches (same as above)
Seven azuki beans    Seven mouse droppings

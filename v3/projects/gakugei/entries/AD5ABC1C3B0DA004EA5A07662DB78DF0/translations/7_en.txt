Festival of Kanda Myōjin Shrine

The festival is held every other year on September 15th. Among the parade floats and festival cars presented by the various neighborhoods of the shrine's parishioners, performances such as "Triumph at Mount Ōe," "Ushiwakamaru's Journey to Northern Japan," and "Korean Embassy's Learning" are particularly famous far and wide, and are considered the most beautiful spectacles.

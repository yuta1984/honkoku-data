(In Kyoto's Myoanji Temple, there was an unusual monk named Roan who was close to Ikkyu Osho of Murasakino and constantly called himself Fuketsu Dojin, enjoying playing the shakuhachi flute. This was in admiration of Fuketsu's musical practices. He initially resided at Kyukoan in Uji, which is said to be the head temple of the komuso monks. Generally, there are schools of Fuketsu Dojin in various places in the eastern and western provinces. One theory says it is a branch of Fuke Osho, but Fuketsu's achievements are considered worthy of adoption. This also appears in Myoe Shonin's leather bag writings and Kenko Hoshi's Tsurezuregusa.)

Otori Daimyojin Shrine - Located about two blocks north of the local Fudo-son. The temple administrator belongs to the Tendai sect and is called Daishoin. The deity enshrined is Yamato Takeru no Mikoto. According to tradition, in the first year of Taido, year of the metal dog (806), the deity from Otori in Senshu Province was invited and enshrined here. This shrine serves as the guardian deity of Meguro Village, with festivals held on the 9th day (of May and September). Sumo wrestling performances are held on this day.

(Upon consideration, the mixing of Yamato Takeru no Mikoto's legend with Meguro Fudo-son may be an error referring to this shrine. This should be considered together with the Fudo-son entry.)

(Additionally, this entire area is called Meguro, divided into upper, middle, and lower sections covering a vast territory. In the second year of Eiroku, the land registry of the Odawara Hojo family records that Ota Genshichiro, Shimazu Magoshiro and others held territory in this area.)

(The Azuma Kagami records the name Meguro Iagoro under the entry for the 7th day of the 11th month of the first year of Kenkyu. He was likely a person from this area.)

Konpira Daigongen Shrine - Located about two blocks west across the street from the same area. The deity enshrined is the same as Konpira-jin of Mount Zozu in Sanuki Province. This shrine is honored as the southern protective deity of the castle. It houses a plaque written by the Kujo family. The temple administrator belongs to the Zen sect and is called Ko-

toji Temple. Within the grounds are trees called "Naniwa no Ume" (Naniwa Plum) and "Sone no Matsu" (Sone Pine).

Chiyogasaki - Refers to a grassy hill beside the road from Shibuya Miyamasu-cho to Meguro Chosenji Temple. It is a scenic location belonging to Nagamine. "Zekkei-kan" is the name of Matsudaira Tonomo-ko's villa, which naturally suits the land with its quiet, serene, and natural character.

Mount Koho Chosen Ritsuin Temple - Located about six blocks west of the same area. It belongs to the Jodo sect under Enzan. Specifically, former Dai-sojoEnzan Shoyo Daigen Osho was the founding master, with Funo Risshi as the second generation. The third generation was Tokumon Osho. (The master's portrait is said to have been carved by his disciple Eton during his lifetime.)

Main Hall (Located on the mountainside, connected by a corridor spanning several dozen ken from the abbot's quarters. This Buddhist hall was first constructed in the 5th year of Meiwa, year of the earth rat (1768).) The principal image is Amida Nyorai of the highest grade of the highest birth. (A seated statue over four shaku tall, created by Jikaku Daishi. It was obtained from Shinrenji Temple in Sakai, Senshu Province, and decorated to serve as the temple's principal image, as recorded in the biography of founding master Tokumon Osho.)

Sutra Repository (Located to the left upon entering the gate. Completed in the 7th year of An'ei, year of the earth dog (1778). It houses the Three Treasures of sutras, precepts, and treatises, as well as commentaries by various masters.) Bell Tower (Built by Master Tokumon in the first year of An'ei, who also composed the inscription himself.)

This temple was established in the 11th year of Horeki, year of the metal snake (1761), when former Dai-sojo Enzan (called Shoyo Shonin Daigen Osho) had long harbored the intention of founding a Ritsu temple, but the official prohibition against opening new temples

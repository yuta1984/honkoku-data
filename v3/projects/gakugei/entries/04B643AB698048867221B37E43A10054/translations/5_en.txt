Hiyoshi Sannō Shrine is located in Nagata Baba and is the greatest shrine in Edo. Its head priest is a Tendai sect high priest called Kanriin. The chief priest is of the Juke family. In addition, there are many shrine monks, shrine families, and shrine maidens. The festival is held every other year on June 15th. The festival procession is described in detail in the first volume under the section on Kayabachō temporary shrine.

Ancient Alligator-mouth Gong (Formerly hung at the main shrine. Now it hangs at the Inari shrine on the right side. It has a diameter of over one shaku. Its inscription is as follows)

"Respectfully donated alligator-mouth gong to the treasure hall of Sannō Gongen, great patron Naokage
Petitioner Nansenbo
Musashi Province Toshima District Edo Castle, Tenshō 14th year (Hinoe-inu), October 25th
Ōta Yamato, carpenter (Nagase Shiina)"

(It is thought that this gong was donated when Sannō Shrine was within Edo Castle, and was later hung at the Inari shrine. This is mentioned here merely to preserve the ancient record)

This shrine was established in the 7th year of Tenchō (830) under Emperor Junna, when Jikaku Daishi, by imperial decree, restored Seiryazan Muryōji Temple in Senba, Iruma District, Musashi Province, establishing the Endon

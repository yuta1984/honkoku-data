Tameike (Reservoir)　Extends southeast from outside Akasaka Gate around the foot of Sannō Shrine. In ancient times, before both the Kanda and Tamagawa water supply systems were drawn to Edo Castle, the water from this pond was used for the city's water supply. {{Marginal note: Maps of Edo from the Kan'ei and Meireki eras record "Akasaka Tameike as the water source for Edo's water supply." The common belief that this pond is Sayama Pond is a grave error. Details are in Volume 4.}} In ancient times, by imperial edict, crucian carp from Lake Biwa in Ōmi Province and carp from Yodo in Yamashiro Province were transported alive and released into this pond, giving it a somewhat different character from others. Many lotus plants were also cultivated, creating a spectacular sight when the flowers bloomed in summer. On the pond's embankment stand two or three ancient zelkova trees called "marker zelkovas." Long ago, Asano Sakyō-no-Taifu Yoshinaga received an imperial command to dam the water at this location. His retainer Yajima Chōun oversaw the project, and after the embankment was completed, these trees were planted as markers to commemorate the achievement for posterity. The slope descending from this embankment toward Azabu Tanimachi is called Enoki-zaka (Zelkova Slope) because of the aforementioned zelkova trees. Also at this location

　On the north side of the embankment, beside the checkpoint next to the weir, there is a plot where hollyhocks are planted. The locals customarily call this "Aoi-ga-oka" (Hollyhock Hill). The slope descending eastward from this spot is called Aoi-zaka (Hollyhock Slope).
　　　{{Marginal note: According to ancient documents of the Odawara Hōjō family, among Ōta Shinjirō's domains is listed a place called "Edo Sakurada Ikebun." This likely refers to this reservoir and similar areas.}}

Reinan-zaka (Reinan Slope)　The slope ascending from above Tameike toward Azabu. During the Keichō era, Tōzen-ji Temple of Takanawa was located here. {{Marginal note: According to a map of Edo from Kan'ei 9, Tōzen-ji was situated above Tameike.}} The temple's founding abbot was called Reinan Oshō. The slope was named in admiration of his spiritual light. Shiomi-zaka runs eastward downhill from above Tameike, alongside the front gate of the Matsudaira Yamato Lord's residence at the same location. Edo-mi-zaka curves from above Reinan-zaka around the north side of both the Toki and Makino family residences, descending toward Nishi-no-kubo.

Azabu-san Zenpuku-ji Temple　Located in Azabu Zōshiki. {{Marginal note: It was formerly called Kishi-san.}} This is a site where Saint Shinran spread Buddhism, one of the seven great temples of the sect in the Kantō region, founded by Saint Ryōkai. As an imperial temple of Emperor Kameyama, its principal image of Amida Nyorai was created by Eshin Sōzu.

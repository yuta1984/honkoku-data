Record of the Origins of Bishamonten'ō of Tamonzan Tengen Zen Temple, Azabu Village, South of the Castle, Toshima District, Musashi Province　　　Recorded by Junior Fifth Rank Lower Grade, Acting Grand Academy Head Lin Nobumitsu

Bishamon is the Heavenly King of the North, called Tamon (Much Hearing). In the Western lands, north is considered supreme. This king's name for good fortune is heard in all four directions, and the name "Tamon of the North" is indeed renowned. He commands the water spirits of the four directions and has countless hundreds and thousands of followers as his retinue.

There is one sacred image here. According to tradition, when our Tōshō-kun's revered mother, Dentsū-in-dono, visited Hōrai-ji temple peak's Yakushi in Mikawa Province, among the twelve divine generals, the Tiger deity responded to an auspicious spiritual dream, and the lord was born in a Tiger year. Therefore, following his mother's instruction, he revered this image. It is said that Prince Shōtoku carved it himself from camphor wood, measuring three feet one inch in length - a sacred image passed down by Minamoto family heir, posthumously granted Senior First Rank, Mitsunaka-kō. There is indeed reason for the lord's reverence. The Great Master Jigen wrote the nine characters "Tōshō Daigongen Mamori Gohonzon" on wooden boards, and those brush traces still exist today. Whenever the lord faced castle sieges or field battles, he invariably carried this image with him. That he surpassed all others, quelled disorder and restored righteousness, controlled the realm and pacified the land - this was the power and virtue of this image. During the Tianboa era of Tang China, when surrounded at Xiliang Prefecture, facing danger while reciting the Niō secret words, 500 divine beings appeared, and golden rats were seen gnawing and severing all the enemy crossbow strings. During the Xiantong period, the appearance of the Heavenly King in monk form in Xichuan - all this was accomplished by this divine power. Though Japan and China are different places, their faithful devotion is truly the same. That the lord transmitted an enduring legacy and established the foundation of great peace - this can be said to exceed human capability. Thereafter, close retainer Abe Ōkura Nobuharu received

orders to oversee the incense and flower offerings. Nobuharu also served as guardian, being born in a Tiger year. His heir Ichimarō Nobukane was also born in a Tiger year and showed ever-increasing respectful devotion. Nobukane once guarded Ōsaka Castle in its early years, maintaining peace within the castle. After many years, when official commands no longer concerned this image, he excavated land at his private residence in Shinagawa, Edo, and built a hall. From this time he was appointed governor of Settsu Province, his official stipend increased, and he lived past ninety. His great-grandson Nobumune was appointed to Tanba. Throughout his life he maintained very close spiritual communion with Ikei Oshō of Shōun-ji temple. Hisanobu's mother had many spiritual dreams about relocating the image. Hisanobu sent a messenger to inform Ikei: "The sacred image frequently appears in spiritual dreams, and moreover, a lay household cannot bear such awe and fear." Ikei accepted this wish and moved it within the temple. Dharma-successor Ryōdō Oshō, moved by the weight of this image and the greatness of its miraculous power, newly established Tengen-ji temple and enshrined this image in a hall to pray for wonderful miraculous responses. Recently I was asked to record its origins, so I cannot remain silent about this.

Note: This is all that can be said. The villagers claim this implement was devised by Aoto Saemon, but whether this is true or false is not worth debating. Even now, some farming households around Yashu (Shimotsuke Province) use these. The diagram is as shown on the left.

Note: The overall shape is as shown in the diagram, made from cedar wood. Thick bamboo is cut like saw teeth and fitted into a horizontal board, with bamboo edging attached from above the horizontal board to prevent movement. According to one theory, the common term "wasabi-oroshi" for the pattern of three triangles arranged horizontally on iris leather may have originated from borrowing the shape of this implement. This seems likely.

Note: The item illustrated below also has roughly the same construction method, with a slightly different shape.

【Continuation of Umenowaka-maru's Mound】
The Noh play "Sakuragawa" (Cherry River) also resembles this. According to its summary, during the reign of Emperor Go-Suzaku, in the Chōryaku era (1037-1040), there was a beautiful youth named Sakurako at Tsukushi-gata, but he was abducted by a human trafficker and served the gods at Jinguji temple of the shrine priests at Isobe in Hitachi Province. His mother, not knowing this, wandered searching for her beloved child's whereabouts, eventually going mad, and in the same spring season, she happened to arrive at Sakuragawa in Hitachi Province. Seeing the flowers on the bank blooming luxuriantly and floating on the water, she believed her child was in this water and continued crying day and night, gathering the flowing flowers. The villagers asked her why, and thinking there might be some connection, they took the mad woman to Jinguji temple and had her meet Sakurako. In her overwhelming joy, her madness immediately returned to normal, and in their long-awaited mother-child reunion, both could not hold back their tears. The resident priest, being compassionate by nature, immediately granted Sakurako leave, and both mother and child returned to Tsukushi. (This matter appears in the Tōgoku Senki)

Upon consideration, the deeds of Umenowaka-maru, as mentioned earlier, bear resemblance to "Aki no Yo Naga Monogatari" (Tale of Long Autumn Nights) and the Noh play "Sakuragawa."

The Baika Mujinzō poetry commentary states:
"Sumida lies between Musashi and Shimōsa provinces, with a willow tree by a small mound along the road."
The same book also states:
"There is a willow tree by the riverside. This is the grave site of Yoshida's child Umenowaka-maru. His mother was from Kitashirakawa," etc.

This content resembles what is said in the Noh play "Sumidagawa" and the meaning of the Bokuboji Temple origin story. The books such as "Kaikoku Zakki" mentioned earlier also refer to it as an ancient mound. "Kaikoku Zakki" is a travel account from Bunmei 18 (1486), about 310 years before the present Kansei era. Even at that time it was called an ancient mound, so it is natural that the legend is not certain.

Uchikawa - Refers to the small river behind Bokuboji temple. According to one person's theory, it is the ancient remains from when the Arakawa and Ayasegawa rivers flowed in many branches in ancient times.

Onzensai-batake (Imperial Garden Fields) - The same location. Refers to the sandbar to the north across Uchikawa. There is a grove of cultivated pine trees, creating quite a beautiful scene.

Tanchō Pond - At the same location. Located below the embankment. A small island is built in the pond. In ancient times, by imperial command, red-crowned cranes were released and kept on the island in this pond. Hence the name.

Iozaki - Said to be to the north of Bokuboji temple, or alternatively near Akiba Gongen in Ukechi village. "Chōgetsu Utamakura" includes it in Musashi Province, while "Fubokushō," "Moshiogusa," and others place it in Shimōsa Province. The same name also exists in Suruga. In a booklet called "Murasaki no Hitomoto," someone calls the cape of Koume village Iozaki. This too is said to be uncertain. The same book also says that long ago the land of Honjo was an inlet with particularly numerous capes, so it was written as Iozaki (Five Hundred Capes). However, this has not yet been investigated.

From Shin-Goshūi-shū:
"For my sake, though I make no shelter, would there be lodging at Iozaki on the Sumida riverbank" - Nōchō

From Kenpō Meisho Hyakushu:
"Tonight again, who will lodge at Iozaki, beneath autumn moonlight on the Sumida riverbank" - Emperor Juntoku

Sekiya-no-sato - Refers to the area around Ushida. "Chōgetsu Utamakura" includes it in Musashi Province.
"The day ends at Iozaki on the Sumida riverbank; would there be lodging in Sekiya village"

According to the personal collection, this poem was composed in the 9th month of Kōgen 1 (1256) when visiting Kashima Shrine. At the Sumida River crossing, when he inquired about a village located along the riverbank upstream from this ferry, he was told it was called Sekiya village. Many sea vessels used to anchor in front of it.

When Prince Shōgoin made his journey to the east, he enjoyed this place and composed:
"On the return journey, may there be Sekiya village too, for the inexhaustible view of the Sumida riverbank" - Prince Dōkō

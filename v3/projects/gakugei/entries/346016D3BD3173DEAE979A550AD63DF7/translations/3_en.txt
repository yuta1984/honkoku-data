　Mimeguri Inari Shrine
Around the Genroku period (1688-1704), there was
an old woman in the precincts of this shrine, and when pilgrims
offered sacred offerings (food offerings to the gods),
this old woman would face the rice fields and clap her hands,
whereupon a fox would come from nowhere
and eat the offerings. After the old woman
passed away,
the fox also stopped appearing.
The verse by Kikaku recorded below
　　　　　　describes this
　　　　　　　　event

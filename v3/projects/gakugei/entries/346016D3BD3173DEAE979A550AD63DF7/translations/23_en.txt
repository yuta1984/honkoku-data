【Main text, continuation of Umenowaka-maru's mound】
Coming to see, only the willow planted as a marker remains, spring wind crosses the Sumida riverbank - Lord Kōdō
Do I recall sorrows at this ancient mound? The voice of wind awaiting news from the capital - Lord Konoe Nobutada
This poem is a waka preserved on a tanzaku (poem card) at Bokuboji Temple. The name written is "Yamashiro resident."

The willow planted as a marker has also decayed, only sorrow remains at the ancient mound - Prince Ryōshō
This waka was composed when Prince Manshuin traveled down to the Kantō region and visited this place. The authentic tanzaku is still preserved at Bokuboji Temple. Only the name "traveler" is written.

According to the origin story, Umenowaka-maru was the son of Lord Yoshida Shōshō Korefusa of Kitashirakawa in Kyoto. 《Marginal note: According to the same origin story, Lord Korefusa was troubled by having no heir and prayed to the deity of Hiyoshi, after which this child was granted to him. Because he felt like a single flower blooming on a plum branch, he was named Umenowaka-maru》 He lost his father at age five, and at age seven entered Getsurinji Temple on Mt. Hiei to study. At that time, at a place called Tōmonin, there was also a child named Matsuwaka-maru, and they competed daily in their talents, but he could not match Umenowaka-maru. Because of this, the priest Haraguchi of that temple felt it regrettable, and finally a dispute arose, so Umenowaka-maru secretly escaped and wandered trying to return to his home in Kitashirakawa. When he reached Ōtsu Bay, it was past the twentieth night of the second month. However, he encountered a merchant named Shinobu-no-Tōta from Michinoku (northern Honshu), and deceived by Tōta, was taken far away to the eastern provinces.

【Continuation of Seiryu-san Renge-ji Temple】
When [Hojo Tsunetoki] prayed earnestly to remove his suffering, one night the principal Buddha showed him a divine revelation and bestowed upon him a sacred talisman. Through this sacred talisman, many people of that time were able to ward off illness and preserve their lives. 《Note: Even now, this temple continues to issue such sacred talismans》

According to tradition, in late March of the fourth year of Kangen (1246), Hojo Tsunetoki fell gravely ill. At that time, he called his younger brother Tokiyori to his side and said: "My illness is incurable. After my death, build a Buddhist temple and enshrine therein an image of Prince Shotoku, whom I have long revered." After saying this, he passed away on the first day of the fourth month at the age of thirty-eight. 《Note: The Azuma Kagami states: "On the first day of the intercalary fourth month of Kangen 4 (1246), the lay monk of junior fifth rank lower grade, acting governor of Musashi Province, Taira no Ason Tsunetoki, died. His Buddhist name was Anraku, age thirty-three." This should serve as evidence》

Following this, Tokiyori honored the dying wish and established a temple in Sasuke Valley in Kamakura, naming it Renge-ji. 《Note: Tsunetoki's posthumous Buddhist title was "Renge-ji-den Former Lord of Musashi Anraku Great Zen Meditation Gate"》 He appointed Ben Hoin Shinpan as the founding abbot. 《Note: According to temple records, Shinpan was the nephew of Yoritomo on his mother's side and grandson of Fukai Hogen Hanchi. However, the Kamakura Daijiki records the founding abbot as Ryochu, creating a discrepancy. Further details follow》

Later, Tsunetoki's son Yoritaka came to rule this temple island, but with a strong desire for religious renunciation, he suddenly shaved his head and became a monk. In the autumn of the third year of Koan (1280), he moved the Renge-ji temple from Kamakura to this temple island and became its founding abbot himself. 《Note: He was known as Great High Priest Sasame Yoritaka. It appears that the earlier reference to Shinpan as founding abbot refers to the temple's time in Kamakura. Upon moving to this temple island, Yoritaka became the founding abbot. Various family genealogies list a son of Tsunetoki named Kensuke, noting beside it "Sasaki monk." It is likely that "Sasame" was mistakenly written as "Sasaki." Also, Yoritaka may refer to the same person as Kensuke. This requires further consideration》

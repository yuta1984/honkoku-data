Nakagawa Whiting Fishing (Nakagawa Kisu-tsuri)
Spring whiting (haru-kisu) becomes abundant from the end of March into April. Spring fishing is said to have originated around the Kanbun era (1661-1673) with a boatman named Jinbei from the ship Gotairiki in Nansō (Bōsō Peninsula). A man named Iwasaki Hyōdayū continued this tradition, and the current Iwasaki school of fishing began with this person. From this time onward, spring whiting fishing became popular in society. Autumn whiting season runs from the end of August to mid-September. However, when October arrives and the cold weather sets in, the fish move to deeper waters offshore, so river fishing yields no catch. Fishermen call those born in the sea "white whiting" and those found in rivers "blue whiting." There are also size differences among whiting. Current-year fish have white bellies and are five to six sun long; these are considered two years old. Those with slightly yellowish bellies and blackish backs, measuring seven to eight sun, are called three years old. Those nine sun or longer with yellow bellies tinged with red and black backs are called "nose-bent" (hanamakari). Those with coarse scales exceeding one shaku in length are called "cold wind" (samukaze). This is according to the fishermen's explanation.

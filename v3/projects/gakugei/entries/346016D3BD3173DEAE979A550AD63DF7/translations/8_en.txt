Kofuku Zen Temple

Osmanthus flowers—
Six feet tall,
Four people
In Tang style
Fragrance surrounds us

Second year of Genroku, mid-autumn (September 1689)
Travel journal of the third day on the Sumida River
　Visiting Mount Gozusan,
　bowing before the Buddha,
　when I entered
　the dining hall,
　morning glories were arranged
　in a vase on the desk,
　creating a touching scene
　before my eyes

　In the dining hall
　　morning glories
　　　　arranged—
　　how touching
　　　　it is

　Visiting Gozu Temple　by Nankaku
Beyond the gate, a long embankment where dark waters flow
In eastern Edo, precious trees lean toward Gozu
Golden dragons open pavilions—whose family feast is this?
Jade maidens ride the waves—where do they wander?
Hidden valleys hold boats swaying, moored to tidal shores
Arriving here, the heart should feel as vast as empty sky
Why then do wind and mist still stir this traveler's sorrow?

Sumida River Embankment
Spring Scene

Far and wide
mist spreads across—
looking out over the embankment of Sumida River,
the drooping branches of green willows like cascading hair
and verdant eyebrows
hang down fragrant and beautiful, while budding
flowers begin to bloom,
seeming to create
smiles,
and the evening glow standing intermixed is truly
beautiful. Especially the single-petaled cherry blossoms blooming in profusion—
　surely these are meant for hair ornaments,
　　and as one thinks to pluck a branch, naturally the heart
　　　lingers beneath these trees

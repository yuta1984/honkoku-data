In the autumn of Tenpun 15 (1546), when Hōjō Sakyō-no-Taifu Ujiyasu of Odawara was engaged in small hawk hunting in Musashino, he sought lodging for one night at Jōkō-ji temple in Kasai and composed a waka poem on the theme "Pine Wind Entering the Koto (Japanese harp)." This is recorded in "Musashino Kikō" (Journey to Musashino).

Listen to the voice
of the blowing pine wind
throughout the night—
though the melody differs,
the sound never changes
　　　Hōjō Ujiyasu

In the area of Kasai, people plant seasonal flowers and plants in their backyard gardens and along the edges of their fields throughout the four seasons, so fragrant aromas constantly fill the air. The local people wait for the flowering season, harvest these flowers, and bring them to flower shops in the streets of Edo to sell them - this practice is extremely flourishing.

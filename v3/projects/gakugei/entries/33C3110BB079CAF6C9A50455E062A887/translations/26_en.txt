The grounds of this temple face the flow of the Tama River and are a place of scenic beauty. Mount Fuji, Hakone, the distant peaks of Chichibu District and others can be viewed in one panorama, making it an extremely charming location. To the north lies the old site where Tatekawa Kunaita'ifu's castle once stood in ancient times, still preserving its topographical features and evoking nostalgic feelings for the past. Also, a person named Igarashi Kobunchi, who was a retainer of the Hōjō clan of Odawara, is said to have lived in this area according to local tradition. The previously shown commendation letter from Eiroku 3 also records the name Igarashi Ichizaemon, who was likely a member of the same clan. For this reason, even today there are many people of the Igarashi family in this area. 《Upon examination, Igarashi Kobunchi was a person killed by Asahina Yoshihide in the Wada Battle. The local people may be confusingly and mistakenly transmitting this information》

Hachiman Shrine　Located about two chō north of the same place. The shrine priest of the Miyazaki family serves here. The enshrined deity is Hontawake-no-mikoto, one seat. According to tradition, it was established by invocation on the 15th day of the 8th month of Kenchō 4, year of the Water Ox.
The honji buddha is Amida Nyorai, a golden buddha measuring 4 sun and 8 bu in height, said to be the work of Kōbō Daishi. 《The back surface is concave like a mask and has a very ancient patina. Upon examination, this is what people commonly call a "halo buddha"》 However, during the Tenshō period, the shrine hall was destroyed by wildfire. At this time, the principal image was also lost.

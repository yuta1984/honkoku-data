　　The area around here is called Ozawa-ga-hara.
　　The mountaintop behind this shrine is the castle ruins
　　where Ozawa Jirō Shigemasa lived.

　　fortified himself in this castle, but
　　Yoshisato Kunai Saemon-no-jō
　　and others marched out from Yokoyama
　　and attacked and captured
　　this castle,
　　as recorded in the

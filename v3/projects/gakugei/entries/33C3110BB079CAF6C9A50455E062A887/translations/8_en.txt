　　Rice Planting

On the sixth day of the fifth month, the sacred rice planting
ritual takes place. The people of Musashi
Province come carrying rice seedlings
to plant them in the sacred rice fields.
Village children hold up
ceremonial spears with umbrellas decorated with
white heron figures, singing
"senhaikoshi no
umbrella," and in their dance they also
sing "sasu mono wa kore mono"
as they plant the seedlings in rows.

They descend into the rice paddies
and trample the seedlings, covered in mud,
dancing and performing. Therefore,
like those that once lay buried
in similar mud, in a single night
they sprout and repeatedly rise up,
forming dewdrops on their leaf tips—
how infinitely beautiful this is.

...the area around there shows destruction, and it also appears as "Tahakawa" in the Hōjō family's property records.
The water source originates in Mount Tanba in Kōshū (according to Tasawa Yoshiakira's "Study of Place Names in Musashino," it is an error to consider this Mount Tanba as being in Musashi), and when it enters Tama District of this province, the Hinohara River also joins it (said to originate from the mountains and valleys of Mount Hinohara, Mount Kosuge, etc. in Tama District). It passes through the foot of Mount Mitake, flows along the south of Ōme to Hamura (where there is an intake for Yotsuya waterworks) and reaches places like Fussa and Haijima. At this location, the Aki River also joins (the Aki River originates from the border area of Kōshū and flows along places like Ina Village and Itsukaichi Village in Tama District). It also reaches a place called Ishida where the Asai River joins (flowing out from the mountains around Hachiōji), and from places like Izumi Village and Nakashima Village onward, it flows eastward between the three districts of Tama, Ebara, and Tachibana to meet the sea (on the Tachibana District side it flows along places like Noborito, Futako, Kosugi, Hirama, and Kawasaki; in Ebara District it flows along places like Seta, Todoroki, Shimomaruko, Yaguchi, Hachimanzuka, and Haneda. From the Kōshū border to Hamura in Tama District of this province is over ten ri, and from Hamura to Rokugō is sixteen ri. The "Study of Place Names in Musashino" states that its total flow is about forty ri, which would be the distance from its source).

Man'yōshū Volume 14:
Tamagaha ni sarasu tetsukuri sara sara ni nani so
Kono ko no kokoda kanashiki
(This poem appears in the Shūi-shū, Love section 4, as anonymous: "At Tama River, the hand-woven cloth being bleached—how dear the people of old are." The Rokujō also has "How dear the past is now.")

At Chōfu where cloth is bleached on fence posts, morning dew pierces through but does not linger in Tama River village - Teika

At Tama River where hand-woven cloth is bleached, I trust anew in the world—the pathos of passing sunlight - Ietsutaka

The Musashi Provincial Gazetteer states: Tama District, Tama River
Various fish including eagles, plovers, and cormorants emerge, and local people make tribute cloth to offer to the Imperial Treasury, etc.

The Azuma Kagami states: Ninji 2, Year of the Metal Ox, 10th month, 22nd day, Day of the Fire Rat: It has been decided that rice fields should be opened in Musashino. Regarding this, as the waters of Tama River should be diverted, this may constitute a violation of the land, etc.
(It appears this was the beginning of opening rice fields in Musashino and drawing water from Tama River for irrigation.)

This river represents the scenic beauty of Musashino, and west of Hinozu, the beauty of its waters and stones is most exceptional. Though the eastern part is flatland, where the long flow passes, the scenery frequently changes and is not without beautiful views. Sweetfish are considered this river's specialty product. Therefore, from early summer to late autumn, people from the capital come here without minding the distance to fish and hunt.

Takahata-san Kongō-ji Temple: Located in Takahata Village (the name Takahata Saburō appears in the Azuma Kagami—perhaps he came from this place). It belongs to the Shingon sect of the New Doctrine and is affiliated with the Sanbō-in Imperial Temple in the capital. It was founded before the Taihō era, and later rebuilt by Kōbō Daishi and again by Jikaku Daishi. The principal deity, Fudō Myōō (an ancient Buddha of unknown maker), is a seated statue over one jō tall (with nineteen Sanskrit characters carved in the flame halo, expressing the aspect of infinite benefit and unwavering determination). The two attendant boy figures are said to be the work of a supernatural being (according to temple records, once a supernatural monk suddenly appeared and announced that it was improper for this principal deity to lack two boy attendants).

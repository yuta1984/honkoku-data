Fuchū Rokusho-no-miya (Six-Place Shrine)

Located at the boundary between Ono-no-miya and Funbai, the road from Fuchū to Sekido was formerly the route from Ōshū (northern provinces) to Kamakura, and was called the Jin-kaidō (Military Highway). During the period from Genkō to Eikyō eras, this was frequently a battlefield, which is how this place name came to be.

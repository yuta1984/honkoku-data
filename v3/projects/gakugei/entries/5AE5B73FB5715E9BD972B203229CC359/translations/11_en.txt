One Hundred Tofu Treasures
　　　　　　　Naniwa　Compiled by Seikyō Dōjin Kabitsujun

　　　Ordinary Grade

[1] Tree Bud Dengaku　Fill a large bowl with warm water, and do both the cutting of tofu and skewering
　　　within this water. Even with soft tofu, there is no
　　　worry of dangerously dropping it. Pull it from the water and immediately grill over fire. ○ For the miso,
　　　adding tree buds is of course essential. If you mix about two parts of the thick portion of sweet rice wine into the miso,
　　　it will be especially good. If you add too much, it becomes too sweet and is rather undesirable.

　　　　　　　and over two sun deep, made of square pottery. The surface is glazed
　　　　　　　and fired. The bottom is
　　　　　　　【Illustration of bottom shape】shaped like this, with many holes
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　six to seven bu in size drilled through.
　　　　　　　It fits inside a wooden container, with the container four to five sun deep, with separate legs.
　　　　　　　There is a ledge inside, and the brazier has
　　　　　　　a catch about one sun from the top. Use charcoal fire without ash. Put water in
　　　　　　　the container to regulate the heat. It's best to prepare two sets
　　　　　　　of both brazier and container, and when the water warms up, replace it with cold water.

　　　When the water is warm, it cannot properly regulate the heat. There are also braziers and containers
　　　made entirely of copper. This is for grilling dengaku in the parlor as
　　　entertainment for guests. At such times, one does not use a fan
　　　to blow on the fire. The fire burns vigorously without the trouble of ash flying about.
　　　○The sand dengaku of Megawa in Ōmi Province and Imamiya in northern Kyoto will appear in the sequel.

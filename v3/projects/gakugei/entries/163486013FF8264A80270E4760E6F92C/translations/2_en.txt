Instructions for Playing Genji Karuta Picture Matching Game
There is no fixed number of players - three or more people, any number is fine. Divide the fifty-four cards into equal numbers and hold them so that players cannot see each other's cards. ○Initially, whoever holds the eight cards from Kiritsubo to Hana no En and the two cards of Wakana Jō and Ge should arrange them at the beginning. ○When first distributing the cards, if there are leftover cards, give them to the person who holds the ten cards from Kiritsubo to Wakana. ○Now, the person holding the Kiritsubo card starts by calling out. The name called should be any name not in one's own hand, chosen at will. Waiting for that call, the person holding the called card plays it. If there are consecutive cards, any number of cards may be played. That person then calls out a name they think of. Proceeding in order as described above, the person who first gets rid of all their cards wins. ○When calling cards, it is considered shameful to call a name that you hold in your own hand.

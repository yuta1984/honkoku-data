Respectfully Harmonizing with the Early Spring Imperial Visit to Princess Taiping's Southern Villa
Written by Imperial Command - Su Ting

The mountain gate of the princess's mansion rises beside the Ba River. The imperial excursion and scenery enter the early spring season. Below the Phoenix Tower, the imperial guards' weapons are arrayed in formation. Above the Magpie Bridge, the imperial pavilion shines clearly. Looking at the garden, colorful stones are encountered among the flowers, and from time to time, red springs are seen within the bamboo groves. This morning I attend at the Pingyang Hall. I do not envy those who once rode rafts to the edge of the Milky Way.

[Commentary]
Princess Taiping was born to Empress Wu Zetian and received special favor among all the princesses. After Emperor Ruizong's accession, the princess's authority shook the entire realm. During Emperor Xuanzong's time, she instigated a rebellion and was ordered to destroy herself. The princess's residence has its mountain gate built beside the Ba River. During Emperor Ruizong's imperial visit, the scenery was particularly beautiful as it entered early spring. Because there was an imperial visit to the magnificent Phoenix Tower, various weapons including bows, arrows, spears, and halberds were arranged below for protection. The imperial pavilion appears brilliantly around the bridge where magpies seem to perch. Looking at the imperial garden, five-colored stones are placed among the flower plantings everywhere, indicating the extraordinary nature of the scenery. Occasionally, red springs flow from the bamboo thickets. The place we attend this morning is like the hall of Princess Pingyang, sister of Emperor Wu of Han - this reference is used because she was Emperor Ruizong's aunt. Since this is not a place one can easily visit, I do not envy those who once rode rafts to the edge of the Milky Way.

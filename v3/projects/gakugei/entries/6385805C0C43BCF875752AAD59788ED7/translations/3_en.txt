Kozanbo previously published the "Illustrated Tang Poetry Selection." At that time, they selected three or four pieces, or five to seven pieces from various sections, chosen at random without any particular order. Fortunately, it became popular in the world. Based on this, they now use the poems remaining from the previous publication to create a sequel. Therefore, following the previous edition, they requested simplified explanations in kana script for the poems, and had the former Hokusai, now an old man, illustrate their meanings with drawings for this latter volume. When the previous edition was published, there were no plans for a sequel.

Therefore, various sections of five-character regulated verse, seven-character regulated verse, five-character extended regulated verse, etc., were selected randomly, with no chronological order of the poets' periods. This volume also cannot remedy this situation. Following this approach, please do not find it strange that there is no order of Early Tang, High Tang, Middle Tang, and Late Tang periods. This volume is certainly not intended for adults, but specifically for children to memorize Tang poetry.

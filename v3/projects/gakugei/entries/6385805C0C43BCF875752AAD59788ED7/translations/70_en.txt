A Poem on Xuangong's Mountain Pool

The traces of Yuangong's retreat from the world lie on the peaks of Mount Lu. The quiet dwelling of this enlightened master is in the Jetavana forest. Even a single stone and a solitary cloud seek glimpses of Xuangong's physical form, while the bright moon over the clear pool illuminates his meditative mind. When he waves his ruyi scepter, heavenly flowers seem to fall; as he sits and lies in his quiet chamber, spring grasses grow deep. All other worldly dust fails to stain this place, and only someone like Xuandu remains to be sought out and visited.

[Commentary]
Long ago, the traces of Yuangong of Jin who escaped from the world were on the peaks of Mount Lu. Today, the quiet residence of the bodhisattva called Xuangong is in the Jetavana forest. Even small stones and distant clouds seem to peek at Xuangong's figure in his kasaya robes, appearing before him as if to bring him joy. The white moon overlooking the clear pool illuminates the master's heart entered in meditation. When he gestures with his ruyi scepter, it seems as if flowers fall from heaven. In his quiet chamber where he sits and lies in seclusion, with no human footprints, spring grasses grow thick and deep. Thus, with only stones, clouds, pool, moon, heavenly flowers, and spring grass, no other worldly noise stains this place, and only a friend like Xu Xuandu, who once associated with Zhidun, remains to seek out and visit.

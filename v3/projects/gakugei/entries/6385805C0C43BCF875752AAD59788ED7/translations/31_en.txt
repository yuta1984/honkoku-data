Respectfully composing in harmony with "Going out to the garden on a spring day and gazing about" - Imperial Command　　Jia Zeng

The Bronze Dragon Gate opens at dawn, and after inquiring about wellbeing, one returns. The golden carriage enjoys spring outings as Bowang Garden opens. The clear light of the Wei River stirs the grass and trees, and the auspicious qi of Zhongnan Mountain enters the towers and pavilions. Having summoned the wise, he already has the old men of Shang Mountain following him, and in the rear carriage he also summons the talents of Yexia. This minister remains alone in the southeast, delighted to encounter the brilliant literary works coming from the sun's edge.

When Xuanzong was crown prince, Jia Zeng served as an attendant but was later reassigned to the Eastern Capital. Being familiar with him, the prince sent down a poem commanding him to compose a matching verse. For an emperor one would say "responding to imperial command," but for a crown prince one says "responding to princely command." This is a matching poem from that time. The Bronze Dragon Gate is also called the Dragon Tower Gate - it is the gate where the crown prince resides. "Opening at dawn" means passing through the imperial corridor to the palace hall, and after inquiring about Emperor Ruizong's wellbeing and returning, he rides in a gold-decorated carriage for spring recreation, with an imperial garden like the Han dynasty's Bowang Garden spread open. The clear light of the Wei River reflects on the vegetation, sparkling and glittering, which is expressed as "stirring." The auspicious qi of Zhongnan Mountain appears to enter the towers and pavilions. Responding to the poem's theme of "focusing one's gaze," it says: Because he loves learning, he summons wise men, already having elderly men like the Four Hoary Heads of Shang Mountain following him, seated in the rear carriage. He also summons outstanding individuals like the Seven Talents of Yexia to compose poetry.

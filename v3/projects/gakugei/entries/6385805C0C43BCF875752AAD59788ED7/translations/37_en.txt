Passing Through Huayin

The lofty Mount Taihua looks down upon the capital of Xian, and the three peaks beyond the sky remain unfinished even when carved. Before Emperor Wu's shrine, clouds are about to disperse; atop the Immortal's Palm, rain clears for the first time. The rivers and mountains to the north face the perilous Qin Pass, while the post road to the west connects to the flat Han altar grounds. I would ask the fame-seeking travelers by the roadside: nothing compares to learning longevity in this place.

This is a poem composed while traveling the post road north of Mount Hua. The towering Mount Taihua bows toward the capital of Xianyang, and the three peaks—Lotus Peak, Maiden Peak, and Pine-Cypress Peak—rise beautifully to the edge of heaven. Even the most skilled human craftsmen, no matter how hard they try to carve, could never create such beauty. Before the shrine where Emperor Wu of Han prayed for immortality, clouds are about to scatter, and atop the Immortal's Palm, rain has just cleared, making everything clearly visible. To the north, the rivers and mountains face Qin Pass, rising high and appearing treacherous, while the post road at the foot extends west, connecting to the flat grounds where Emperor Wu offered sacrifices to the gods. I would ask: those travelers passing by this road, rushing to the capital seeking fame and advancement, have restless hearts and fail to notice the tranquil nature of these mountains. But there is nothing better than withdrawing to a place where one can forget this world and study the immortal way of longevity. In truth, this means that since the officials above are corrupt and ignorant, in such times it is better to live in retirement rather than serve in office.

Preface to the Illustrated Tang Poetry Selection 【Seal "Oshi■■"】
Cangming said: "In five-character regulated verse and extended regulated verse, various poets generally have many excellent lines. However, the form of seven-character regulated verse is difficult for various poets. Wang Wei and Li Qi of the High Tang period reached considerable mastery of its subtlety. Even Du Fu's works, though numerous, are naturally unrestrained. The author suffers on his own." From this perspective, even among Tang poets, none completely mastered all poetic forms.

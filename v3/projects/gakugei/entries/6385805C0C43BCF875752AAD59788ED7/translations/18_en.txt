A court poem written in harmonized rhyme, celebrating the imperial visit to Bōshun Palace on a spring day

Looking eastward, the spring at Bōshun Palace appears lovely. Moreover, when encountering a clear day, the willows contain mist. Looking down from within the palace, the entire southern mountains can be seen. Looking out peacefully from atop the castle, the Big Dipper hangs in the sky. The fine grass particularly receives the places where the imperial carriage turns. Flying flowers deliberately fall and dance before the wine cups. The emperor's pleasure in response to this knows no bounds. Birds play with their song voices, mixing with the orchestral music. [Seal: "Seika"]

During the Tang dynasty, there were Bōshun Palaces in the north and south, both located east of Chang'an Castle and west of the San River. One should pay attention to the characters for "north and south" in the third and fourth lines. Since the spirit of spring arises from the east, when one looks toward Bōshun Palace in the east, the spring scenery appears charming. Especially when encountering pleasant weather, even the willows appear to contain mist within their greenery. These first three lines describe the scenery one imagines before the imperial visit to Bōshun Palace. Now, when the imperial visit takes place and one looks down from within the palace, the prominent southern mountains in front of the imperial palace can be seen from corner to corner, hence the word "exhaustively." Above the imperial castle, looking out peacefully, the Big Dipper stars hang suspended, expressing extreme height. The southern mountains contain the congratulatory meaning found in the Book of Songs, while the Big Dipper contains the notion of the palace's nobility. From this, one should understand that there are towers in the palace compound both north and south. The third and fourth lines on the right express looking into the distance. The next fifth and sixth lines describe the scenery of looking at what is near. The fine grass growing in the imperial garden, as if possessing consciousness and thinking not to be soiled, grows uniformly in the places where the imperial carriage circles. Also, the scattering flowers, as if they too have consciousness, deliberately fall and dance around the wine cups here and there, as if recommending to drink abundantly while scattering and enjoy. The two characters "exclusively" and "deliberately" make the heartless grass and flowers work as if they had hearts—something that could only be expressed in mature poetry. The emperor's pleasure in response to this scenery knows no bounds of joy, and even the birds rejoice, chirping in unison with song voices and mixing with the orchestral music. This draws from the characters "mixed play" found in the Wenxuan (Anthology of Refined Literature).

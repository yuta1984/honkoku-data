Climbing Sentai on the Ninth Day and Presenting to Prefect Liu
Cui Shu

Emperor Wen of Han had a high platform. On this day when I climb and look out, the dawn colors unfold. The cloud-covered mountains of the Three Jin all face north, while wind and rain from Wuling come from the east. Who could truly know the governor of the border gates? The immortal sage by the river has departed and will not return. I wish to seek out nearby the magistrate of Pengze, and together in joyful intoxication drink from cups adorned with chrysanthemums.

Liu is the surname, and Mingfu means magistrate. He became the prefect of Lingbao County. This county belongs to Shenzhou. There was a high platform where Emperor Wen of Han prayed for immortality, but without any efficacy he passed away. Today when I climb and look out, only the dawn scenery unfolds before me. Desiring to become an immortal and praying for eternal life and deathlessness is futile. These two lines seem like casual conversation with nothing significant, but they contain profound meaning with subtle admonition that cannot be fully expressed in writing. The state of Jin became divided in the Warring States period into Han, Wei, and Zhao, hence called the Three Jin. One can only observe their cloud-covered mountains facing north. There are two imperial tombs, Nanling and Beiling. Beiling is where King Wen took shelter from wind and rain, and that same wind and rain still comes from the southeast of the platform. The governor of Hangu Pass, named Xi, is said to have met Laozi and achieved immortality. If so, being long-lived, there should be some who know him in the world, but seeing that not one person does, it cannot be trusted. There was an immortal sage by the river who taught the Laozi scripture to Emperor Wen, but where that sage might be is unknown. Since Emperor Wen also did not achieve longevity, talk of immortals is futile. Rather than that, I wish to seek out Prefect Liu nearby, who is like Tao Yuanming who became magistrate of Pengze County, and in pleasant relaxation together tilt cups floating with chrysanthemums and become intoxicated. Soon I shall visit you and enjoy ourselves.

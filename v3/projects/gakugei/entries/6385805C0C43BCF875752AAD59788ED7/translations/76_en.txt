Lodging at Master Eikō's Zen Temple and Hearing the Buddhist Chanting

The sacred chanting from the flower palace is distant and faint, the moon hides behind the high castle walls and the bell's sound grows rare. At night, stirring the frost-covered forest, one startles thinking it might be falling leaves; at dawn, hearing the sounds of heaven, pure enlightenment arises. Desolate, already entering the cold sky in silence, rushing sounds still follow the autumn rain like flying. For the first time I realize that this floating life has no permanent dwelling place. Suddenly my heart wishes to take refuge in the Buddhist path.

[Commentary]
"Bon" (梵) refers to the language of India, meaning to listen to sutras and dharanis. This describes the scene at dawn when the faint sounds of sutras and dharanis can be heard from the flower palace, while the moon hides behind high castle walls and the sound of the timepiece becomes rare. The sutra chanting that continues from night sounds like falling leaves rustling in the frost-covered forest, startling the listener. When dawn comes and one hears the natural sounds, pure enlightenment awakens. When the sutra voice becomes low, it creates a melancholy atmosphere, suddenly entering the cold sky in silence. Then the voice rises and falls like autumn rain, sometimes quiet, sometimes rising. Through contemplating this alternation, one first realizes that worldly life has no permanent attachments, and suddenly the depths of one's heart seeks to take refuge in the Buddhist way.

The pleasure of the banquet has already deepened, and just as in the Book of Songs where poems praising the Son of Heaven and composing verses about fish and water plants were made, I have received an imperial command to compose poetry and have created and presented words of celebration. The interpretation up to now has been "composing verses about fish and water plants," but this would not be good. This refers to how, as the banquet revelry has already deepened, receiving imperial favor, one composes poems like those about fish and water plants, and especially receiving favor, presents verses celebrating the Son of Heaven's seeking of successors, just as Yang Xiong composed the "Rhapsody on Ganquan Palace." However, in reality, this was a satire of the Son of Heaven's pursuit of extreme luxury and meaningless activities. This poem too, in its heart, was satirical.

Harmonizing with Wei Zhubao Wulang's Poem on the Hot Springs at Taichang

The Han emperor's detached palace connects to the dew terrace. Evening sun opens across half of the Qin River plain. The verdant mountains are entirely encircled by vermillion banners.
The jade-green ravine flows down from the jade hall. Travelers pass through the groves of Xinfeng, while hunting horsemen return along the castle borders of the small garden.
I hear it said that Ganquan Palace is skilled at presenting poetic compositions. From afar I know that only Ziyun possesses such talent.

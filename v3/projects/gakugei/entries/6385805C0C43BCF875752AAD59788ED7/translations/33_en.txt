Respectfully Harmonizing with the Imperial Spring Visit to Princess Taiping's Southern Villa
Court Response Poem by Li Yong

I have heard tell of the Weaving Maid's loom stone in the Silver River, and now again I see the golden imperial carriage departing from the Purple Forbidden Palace. At the Weaving Maid's bridge, magpies and crows take flight; above the immortals' tower, phoenixes soar. The flowing wind enters the seat and flutters the singing fans; the waterfall strikes the steps and splashes upon the dancing robes. Today, once again like before, we transgress against the Ox and Dipper constellations, boarding rafts together to float upon the ocean tide and return. [Seals: "Zenjing's Seal" "Shoken"]

It has been told since ancient times that there is a Weaving Maid's loom stone in the Milky Way. Now I see again that when the Emperor is summoned in his gold-decorated carriage and departs from the Purple Forbidden Palace for an imperial visit, it is like that very Milky Way. Using "heard tell" and "see again" repeatedly to conclude, speaking of the Weaving Maid. This place, if thought of as the very Milky Way, then at the bridge where the Weaving Maid dwells, magpies and crows arise, and above the tower where immortals reside, phoenixes fly. Also containing the meaning of Nong Yu, it speaks of the flowing wind blowing across. When the flowing wind enters the reception hall, fans used for singing flutter and dance. The waterfall water in the imperial garden faces the front of the steps and splashes upon the dancing garments. Today the two characters "still the same" correspond to the opening line. Transgressing against the Ox and Dipper stars, boarding rafts, all together floating on the ocean tide and returning—it is the same. "Transgressing" means going to places one should not go. "Ox and Dipper" refers to the stars of the Cowherd and Weaving Maid. Boarding a raft to go to the Milky Way is a frequently cited classical allusion from long ago.

【Commentary on the Previous Poem】
A zhushu (chief clerk) is a subordinate official under the taichang who records matters related to rituals. "Gumu" means to cast one's gaze across and observe. The detached palace where the Han emperor went on imperial excursions to the hot springs was built connecting all the way to the dew terrace. Though the Qin River is a great river, because the detached palace was built extensively, one could open the evening sun pavilion and gaze out over half of it. On the green mountains, red banners were arranged in circles all around. This refers to the grandeur of the imperial entourage. The hot springs that bubble up around the verdant valley are channeled to the palace through bamboo conduits, flowing back from the jade hall.

The small garden castle refers to Yichun Garden, a hunting ground east of Chang'an, so one can see hunters returning on horseback from around this small garden castle.

For ten thousand years and a thousand autumns, we serve our sage ruler. [Seal: "Tenshin"]

【Commentary】
Datong Hall was named after expanding Xingqing Palace. Its northeast section is Dragon Pool Hall. Jade fungus grows and auspicious clouds appear above Dragon Pool. Dragon Pool refers to conduits that channel water, found at the eaves of buildings. Five-colored clouds appear. Under Tang regulations, auspicious clouds and celebratory clouds were called "great auspicious signs," while fine grain, divine fungus, and trees with interconnected branches were called "lesser auspicious signs," for which the hundred officials would offer congratulations. During the Tianbao era, sacred fungus grew on the pillar foundations of Datong Hall. With auspicious cloud omens appearing above it, the hundred officials together...

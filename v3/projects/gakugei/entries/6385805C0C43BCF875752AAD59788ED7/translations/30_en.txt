Echoing from afar the "Leaning Pine Poem" of Cai Qiju

The many trees of the pure capital all flourish and are fragrant. It is said that the solitary pine stands out most among the group. Its name reaches the heavenly court with abundant scenery, and its spirit connects to the palace halls, borrowing the auspicious mist. Hanging over the pond, it holds sparkling dewdrops, and like a covering canopy, it sweeps away the auspicious clouds layer upon layer. Not sparing its resin to aid the immortal cauldron, I wish to offer fine timber to the enlightened ruler.

[Seal: "Qixia"]

Cai is a surname, and Qiju refers to an official position that records the emperor's movements while attending him. There is a pine like a leaning canopy in the courtyard of that office, and Zhang Yue composed a poem about it when he was in Yuezhou. Though separated by great distance, I compose the same "Leaning Pine Poem," comparing Cai Qiju's excellent service to the pine in this gift poem.

While all the various trees in the pure capital flourish and are fragrant, it is particularly said that the solitary pine in front of your office building stands out most excellently among all trees. Therefore its name reaches the emperor's court, where it is viewed and praised, making its scenery all the more beautiful. Since the pine's spirit continues to the palace, it borrows the auspicious atmosphere that drifts through the imperial quarters. Because the pine's branches lie horizontally extending over the pond, they hold sparkling dewdrops on the tips of the pine needles. Since pines absorb water, the branches layer upon layer like umbrellas, seeming to sweep away the auspicious clouds. Now, if the emperor were to manufacture immortal medicine, pine resin would be needed, so if it were taken from this pine, there would be no reluctance to give it. Comparing this to Qiju's excellent service, the poem says that not only pine resin, but if fine timber were needed for imperial use, he would wish to offer precious wood to the enlightened ruler - thus comparing Qiju's loyal service, where he would not spare even his life in times of crisis, to the pine's generosity.

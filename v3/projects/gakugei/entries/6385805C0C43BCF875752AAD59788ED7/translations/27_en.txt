"Composed for the New Year at Youzhou" by Zhang Yue

Last year in Jingnan, the plum blossoms were like snow. This year in Jingbei, the snow is like plum blossoms. We both know that human affairs have never been constant. What brings joy is that the years depart and return again. At the frontier garrison, military songs resound day after day. The beacon fires of the capital burn until dawn breaks. Looking far westward toward the sun of Chang'an, I wish to offer a cup of wine praying for longevity like Mount Nanshan.　【Seal: "Tenshin"】

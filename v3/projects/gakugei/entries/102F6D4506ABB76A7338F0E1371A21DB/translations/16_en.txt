【In corner-cut frame】Kajiwara's Two Charges
Ikuta Forest was
the main attack force of the Heike
with over one hundred thousand mounted warriors.
Kajiwara Genta Kagesue
broke off a branch
of beautifully blooming plum blossoms
and stuck it in his quiver.
His appearance was
so splendid
that the enemy cried,
"What a worthy foe!
Don't let him escape!" and he was surrounded
　　　　　　by a great force.

Encircled and with his helmet
knocked off, fighting
bare-headed,
his father Heizō
Kagetoki
turned back
and came
to scatter
the great enemy force,
returning to
their own camp
together with Genta.

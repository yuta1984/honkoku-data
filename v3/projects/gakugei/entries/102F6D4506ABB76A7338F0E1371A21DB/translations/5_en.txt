【Heading】Kamakura Gongorō Kagemasa

During the Later Three Years' War in Dewa Province, he served under Minamoto no Yoshiie at the age of sixteen. In archery and swordsmanship, no one could match him. Although Torinoumi Yasaburō shot an arrow through his left eye, piercing his helmet, he pursued the enemy and killed him with a single arrow—truly a valiant warrior.

【Heading】Torinoumi Yasaburō

He was a resident of Ōshū Province. He served under Kiyohara no Takehira and was a peerless archer. Using a bow that required four men to draw, he took careful aim and shot from a distance of fourteen soku (approximately 25 meters). However, Kagemasa showed no sign of weakness and prepared to shoot a return arrow. Seeing this, Yasaburō fled, but was ultimately killed by Kagemasa.

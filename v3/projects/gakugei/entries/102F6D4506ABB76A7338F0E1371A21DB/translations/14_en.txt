Miura Daisuke Yoshiaki【In corner-cut frame】The Miura clan set out with over three hundred mounted warriors
to join forces with Yoritomo, but when Yoritomo was defeated at the Battle of Ishibashiyama and his whereabouts became unknown,
they were returning empty-handed when they encountered Hatakeyama Shigetada's force of over five hundred riders at Yuigahama
and fought a battle. The Hatakeyama army was defeated, but later they again pressed forward with a large force to attack
Kinugasa Castle. Daisuke, seeing that his allies' strength was weak, said, "I have taken up the bow and arrow since I was thirteen years old,
and now I am seventy-nine years old, aged and with my illness
recurring. To face this battle is the honor of my old age. I will show you Yoshiaki's final battle,"
and donned a white hitatare with narrow sleeves and a pulled-up eboshi cap,
fastened only a sword to his waist, mounted his horse, drew his whip in his right hand, and gathered
the reins in his left, about to ride out when his son Bettō Yoshizumi, seeing his father's
determination, grabbed the horse's bridle. Even when struck with the whip and told to "get out of the way,"
the blows didn't hurt because of his helmet, so he forcibly pulled his father back into the castle. This was Daisuke's
stratagem to inspire his soldiers.

【In corner-cut frame】Kaneko Jūrō Ietada
When the Miura clan took refuge in Kinugasa Castle,
Kaneko also joined forces with Hatakeyama
and laid siege to it. Daisuke (Miura Yoshiaki) recognized that Kaneko's performance
exceeded that of others,
so from within the castle he had a small bucket
filled with sake and brought out
with a cup.
Ietada took the cup,
poured three times, bowed once,
and returned it. In military campaigns, offering
sake is proper protocol. Accepting it is proper etiquette.
Both Daisuke's action and the fact that Ietada
knew the proper military etiquette impressed
everyone.

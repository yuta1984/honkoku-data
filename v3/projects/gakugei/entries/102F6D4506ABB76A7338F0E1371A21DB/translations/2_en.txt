Minamoto no Yoshiie
Although Yoriyoshi pressed forward to Koromogawa, it was an extremely well-fortified stronghold and difficult to capture easily. Then Kiyohara no Takenori devised a stratagem and had fires set within the castle. When Sadato and his brothers began to scatter and flee, Yoshiie aimed at Sadato, nocked an arrow with one hand, and pursued him, calling out loudly, "How now, Sadato! Turn back for a moment - I have something to say!" Thinking he could not escape, Sadato calmed his horse. Then Yoshiie called out in a loud voice:
　　"The vertical threads of the robe have come undone"
Hearing this, Sadato also turned his horse's head back, turned his neck guard around, and completed the poem:
　　"Due to the melancholy of tangled threads worn by years"
Since Sadato completed the verse, Yoshiie removed the arrow he had nocked and turned back.

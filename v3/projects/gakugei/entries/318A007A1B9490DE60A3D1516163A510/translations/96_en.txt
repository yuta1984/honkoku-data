The north wind blows snow that pierces through sword scars
Giving water to horses at the caves of the Great Wall
It is even colder
At midnight, seeing fires rise, we know there are enemies
All together we protect Mount Helan

《Commentary: Since it is winter, the north wind blows, and because it is a battlefield, the wind and snow pierce through the wounds on one's hands, making it unbearable. When going to give water to the horses at the guard post of the Great Wall caves, snow falls upon us, making it even colder than usual and melancholy. Around midnight, signal fires can be seen rising, so knowing that the enemy is attacking, a great number of soldiers rush out all at once in unison to carefully guard Mount Helan so that it will not be taken by the enemy. It is truly a fearsome situation.》

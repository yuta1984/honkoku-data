Inscribed at Yanping Sword Pool - by Ouyang Zhan

Though I imagine the spirit, it is difficult to see
The ferry crossing once departed, water spreads endlessly
Vainly leaving behind the frost-defying color for a thousand years
Long together with the clear pool, the white sun is cold

《Commentary: It is said that the two spiritual swords of Ganjiang and Moye sank in this Yanjin. Now, though I wish to see the spirit of these swords, I cannot see them. Since they once went into the water of this crossing, the swords are no longer visible - only the water flows endlessly. Vainly leaving behind only the color of the sharp tempered blade that defies frost for a thousand years hence, they remain long in the bottom of this water together with the clear pooled water, reflecting in the white sun with an eerie feeling. These are truly famous swords that cannot easily be seen》

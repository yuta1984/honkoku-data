【Poem Title】Cold Food Festival　by Han Hong

In the spring capital, there is no place where flowers do not fly and scatter,
On Cold Food day, the east wind makes the imperial willows lean askew.
At sunset, candles are transmitted from the Han palace,
Blue smoke disperses and enters the homes of the five marquises.【Illustration】

《Commentary: During the Cold Food Festival in spring, there is nowhere in the capital area where flowers do not scatter and fly. The willows around the imperial walls are also blown by the east wind and hang slanting. At sunset on Cold Food day, new fire is kindled and lit on candles to be bestowed upon the retainers, and people receive and relay them. The first to carry the thick blue smoke at top speed goes to the gates of the Five Marquises and Seven Nobles of the imperial family.
Cold Food Festival falls on the 105th day from the winter solstice, occurring in the second month.》

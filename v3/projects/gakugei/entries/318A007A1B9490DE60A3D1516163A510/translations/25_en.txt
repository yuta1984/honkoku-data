【Poem Title】Replying to Magistrate Liu's Poem about Parting in the Southern Country When He Returns to Yangzhou on a Spring Day

In Guangling's third month, when flowers are just blooming,
Meeting you amid the flowers, we get drunk together once.
Traveling between north and south is not particularly far—
Following the evening tide when departing, coming with the morning tide.

《Commentary: Around Guangling in Yangzhou, it is also the third month of spring, so flowers are in full bloom. At this time, whether outside or in the shade of flowers, we meet you and enjoy wine banquets, but we must eventually part. However, meeting again is also easy. This is because you return with the evening tide and come early with the morning tide, so meeting anytime is free and easy. There is no need to worry so much—such are the consoling words spoken.》

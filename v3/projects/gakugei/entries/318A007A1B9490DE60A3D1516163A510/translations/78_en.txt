Huaqing Palace - Cui Lu

Grass blocks the winding steps, the sound of bells ceases; cloud-covered trees grow deep and thick, the jade palace stands cold
The bright moon comes of itself and departs of itself; no longer is there anyone leaning against the jade balustrade

Commentary: The stone steps and mountain paths of the winding stairways where the emperor used to make his imperial visits have long been without such visits, so grass has grown thick and blocks the way, and the sound of the imperial carriage bells has ceased. Around this Huaqing Palace, the great trees towering among the clouds grow deep and thick, and within them the jade halls stand eerily empty, with no one coming and going—lonely and desolate. Only the bright moon, unchanged from ancient times, continues to shine and illuminate as it passes, never varying. But whereas in the past Emperor Xuanzong and Yang Guifei would enjoy themselves here in this palace with large retinues, now there is no one leaning against this jade balustrade to gaze upon the moon.

Commentary: Because it is spring, the willows flourish, their branches intertwining shadows so thickly that one cannot tell where the palace buildings are. They are enclosed, and in this tender green color of young leaves, they are moistened by the blessing of rain and dew and have grown luxuriantly in this way. The underlying meaning speaks of a woman's feelings - that in her youth she received the emperor's favor and was blessed by his grace. If the phoenix palanquin (imperial carriage) could be seen together with the emperor, it would be delightful, but since his favor has waned, the emperor's phoenix palanquin no longer comes. Spring is about to end, but with no one to observe, only the empty sound of the warbler's song remains, crying from morning to evening, yet no one loves her.

Breaking Willow Branches - Duan Chengshi

Branch upon branch interlacing shadows, enclosing Changmen Palace
The tender green once moistened by rain and dew's blessing
The phoenix palanquin comes not, spring wishes to end
Emptily preserving the warbler's song until dusk

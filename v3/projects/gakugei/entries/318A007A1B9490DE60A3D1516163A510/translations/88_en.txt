At dusk by the Wuding River - the sound of a flute
At the side of Helian Terrace - a traveler's feelings
The road home to Hanguan Pass - over a thousand li
In one autumn evening's wind - white hair grows

《Commentary: Now in the evening by this Wuding River, when the melancholy sound of a flute echoes, the traveler beside Helian Terrace is stirred to various sorrowful feelings and remembers his homeland. When I calculate the distance to my homeland at Hanguan Pass where I should return, it is more than a thousand li away and I cannot go back, so my thoughts become increasingly troubled. Perhaps because of this, in just one night, while this autumn wind blows, white hair has suddenly appeared and I have become an old man with white hair. I do not know when I will be able to return to my homeland》

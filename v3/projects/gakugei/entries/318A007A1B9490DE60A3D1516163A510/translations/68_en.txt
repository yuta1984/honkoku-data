Chengde Music　By Wang Biao

Zhao women, riding on spring, ascend the painted tower
One voice begins to sing, filling the entire city with autumn melancholy
Without reason they sing again the tune of "Guanshan"
Even those who are not soldiers on campaign shed tears as well

Commentary: The state of Zhao is a place with many courtesans, and these courtesans, taking advantage of the spring scenery, ascend to the painted tower and sing loudly for entertainment. Their voices fill the entire city, causing all those in the vicinity to feel deep emotion and sorrow, making their hearts feel like autumn even though it is spring. Just hearing their songs is already sad enough, but when they begin singing the tune of "Guanshan Moon" for no particular reason, even those who have not come to this area for military campaigns are moved to sadness and shed tears, so soldiers on campaign would be all the more deeply moved to sorrow.

Palace Lament - Sima Li

Willow colors unevenly draping over the painted tower, dawn warblers cry sending forth the sorrow of the entire palace
Year after year flowers fall with no one to see, emptily following the spring stream out through the imperial ditch

Commentary: The willows flourish luxuriantly, their long and short branches hanging unevenly, covering and overshadowing the painted tower where the court ladies reside. At dawn, warblers sing near these willows, but both what is seen and what is heard all become sources of sorrow for the entire palace. Year after year the flowers scatter and fall, but because the palace is so deep and secluded, no one comes to see them. They fall emptily onto the water's surface, following the spring stream's flow and flowing out through the imperial ditch. The underlying meaning is that just as these flowers fall, she too ages and her beauty fades, but living in the palace depths, no one notices her, and she grows old in vain. [Illustration]

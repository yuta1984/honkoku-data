"Ancient Parting" by Wei Zhuang

Clear mist drifts faintly, willows sway gracefully
I cannot help these feelings of parting
Half-drunk on wine, I take up my jade whip once more
Pointing toward the distant clouds, my heart breaks
The beauty of spring lies in Jiangnan

[Commentary: Since this is the beginning of spring, the sky's scenery is clear and expansive, and the willows sway beautifully in the wind. To part with a dear friend at such a time is regrettable, but parting feelings cannot be helped. Since the drinking party is already half over, we must part as soon as this banquet ends. Even so, with both of us mounting our horses for the farewell, I take my jade whip and point toward the distant clouds, saying "You will go from that direction toward Jiangnan," thinking with heart-rending emotion. Since Jiangnan is a place where spring comes early, if you were to see the spring scenery of Jiangnan, your longing would surely increase even more—such are my thoughts.]

【Poem Title】Seeing Off Wei the Sixteenth as He Returns to Suzhou

On this autumn night, deep and silent, I see you off here,
The insects in shadow chirp mournfully—unbearable to hear.
Tomorrow your returning boat will take the Piling road,
When I turn my head back, only white clouds will remain over Gusu.【Illustration】

《Commentary: In the lonely time when the autumn night grows deep and silent, I see you off. Parting is sad enough as it is, but the insects chirp mournfully without cease, making it increasingly sorrowful and unbearable to hear. Tomorrow, saying you will return, you will board a boat and travel far along the Piling road. When you are gone, I will turn my head back in longing, but your figure will no longer be visible—only white clouds will drift vaguely around Mount Gusu, likely increasing my melancholy. This expresses the poet's imagining of the moment of parting tomorrow morning.》

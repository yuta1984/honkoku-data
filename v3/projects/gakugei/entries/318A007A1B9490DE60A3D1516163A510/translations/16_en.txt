Again Sending Off Magistrate Pei on His Demotion to Jizhou　Liu Changqing

Apes cry, guests scatter at the riverside in evening twilight
People naturally grieve in their hearts, water naturally flows
Both made exiled ministers, you go even farther away
Ten thousand li of green mountains, one lonely boat

[Commentary: Now, when sending that person off, it is evening time, so the apes also cry in farewell, and the guests who came to see him off scatter here and there from this riverside. Both those who go and those who send them off pain their hearts and grieve at the parting, yet this river water flows without any feeling. Both you and I are exiled ministers who have been driven away from the capital, but among us, you are being banished to an even more distant country, floating a lonely boat toward the far side of ten thousand li of green mountains—this is truly a pitiful thing.]

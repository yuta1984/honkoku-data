Why do you return so carelessly from Xiaoxiang?
The water is blue, the sand bright, moss on both banks
When the twenty-five-stringed zither is played in the moonlit night
Unable to bear the pure lament
The geese fly back instead　　　Returning Geese

[Commentary: The geese come to the Xiaoxiang area, but for some reason they pay no attention and return carelessly. The Xiaoxiang scenery has blue water and bright sand - such beautiful scenery, so why do they abandon it and leave? There is a zither piece called "Returning Geese Melody," so this poem is composed in connection with that. ○This place is where Emperor Shun's consorts Ehuang and Nüying drowned themselves, so if their spirits were playing the twenty-five-stringed zither in the moonlit night, the geese would be unable to bear their resentment and would fly backwards in retreat.]

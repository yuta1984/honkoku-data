The sequel to the Tang Poetry Selection Picture Book has been completed. I was asked to write a preface. I do not know about painting, but I will speak of poetry.

are these not the long narrative poems? The distant trees and sparse foothills,
the mountain towns and fishing villages—are these not the five- and seven-character quatrains?

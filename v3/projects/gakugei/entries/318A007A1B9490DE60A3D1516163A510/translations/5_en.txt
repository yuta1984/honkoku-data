Hearing the Flute Played on the Frontier

Snow pure, in the barbarian sky, herding horses, they return
Moon bright,羌 flutes in the watchtowers
I ask: plum blossoms, where do they fall?
Wind blows, filling the border mountains through one night

[Commentary in smaller text: When snow flickers and reflects in the sky, leading back horses that were left grazing in the fields, someone unknown plays the Qiang flute around the watchtowers throughout the bright moonlit night]

[Commentary in smaller text: The playing continues and reaches the melody of "Falling Plums." I would like to ask and learn: this is not the season when plum blossoms fall, so from where to where do they fall as that melody is played? Scattered by the wind, it fills the border mountains throughout the night, and there is no one who does not hear it. The meaning is that those who have come here on military campaigns, upon hearing this melody, would recall thoughts of their homeland and feel sorrow]

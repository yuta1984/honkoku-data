Waves Washing Sand - A Song

At Parrot Isle's shore, waves drift the sand about
Spring view from the pleasure quarters, the sun is about to set
Swallows carrying mud compete to return to their homes
Only the foolish husband alone does not think of home

《Commentary: Around Parrot Isle, the scenery of sand being carried by the waves can be seen from the pleasure quarters. Today's sun is already tilting westward and about to set. She gazes out every day through the long spring days. Why does she watch? Because her husband went to a foreign land and the day he should return has already passed, so she worries about what might have happened. Looking across, she sees that when swallows carrying mud return to their nests, they do return, yet her foolish husband seems not to think of his wife and children - what an inconsiderate man he is》【Illustration】

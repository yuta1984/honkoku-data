Border Poem (Henshi)
Zhang Jingzhong

In Wuyuan, spring's colors have always come late since ancient times
In the second month, the drooping willows have not yet put forth their threads (new shoots)
Just now is the day when ice on the riverbank begins to melt
This is precisely when flowers are falling in Chang'an

《Commentary: The borderland around Wuyuan is a place of severe cold, so unlike the capital, spring colors come late to this region. This is not just now, but has been so since ancient times. Around the second month, which should be the height of spring, in this place the willows have not yet put forth their threads (new shoots) and buds have not even sprouted. Now is finally the time when ice along the riverbank begins to melt, so precisely at this time in the capital Chang'an, the flowers that had bloomed are already scattering and it is near the end of spring. To dwell for a long time in such a place of severe cold is indeed a sorrowful thing》

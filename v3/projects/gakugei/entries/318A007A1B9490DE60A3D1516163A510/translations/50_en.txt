Gazing at the Moon on the Fifteenth Night
　　Wang Jian

The middle courtyard's ground is white, crows roost in the trees, cold dew silently moistens the osmanthus flowers
Tonight the moon is bright, all people gaze upon it, but who knows in whose home autumn melancholy dwells【Illustration】

《Commentary: Tonight being the fifteenth night, the courtyard scenery appears brilliantly white as the moon shines clearly, with crows and such roosting in the garden trees. During the early evening they were startled by the moonlight and made noise, but now that night has deepened, they rest peacefully in the trees. Though one does not notice the cool dew settling in the late night, the osmanthus flowers appear moistened without sound. Tonight being the night of the full moon, there is no one anywhere who does not gaze upon it, but I alone feel this scene and think sadly of autumn》

Seeing Off Lu Qiju
　Wu Yuanheng

Xiang Ru traveled with post horses in splendor, why do tears wet my robes as I lean on the railing?
At the old office by East Mountain familiar courtesans remain, again with song and dance I send off your homecoming【Illustration】

《Commentary: Long ago when Sima Xiangru was appointed to the position of Palace Attendant, he returned to his homeland of Shu with imperial post horses, traveling in magnificent and splendid fashion. You too have achieved success and now return to your homeland, so like Xiangru you arrange post horses everywhere and travel with brilliance and magnificence, which is indeed joyous. Yet for some reason I shed tears at the railing that scarcely have time to dry, feeling regret at our parting. Thinking that unfamiliar courtesans met for the first time would provide little comfort, I call upon the familiar courtesans from near your former office around East Mountain, and as before, with singing and dancing, I wholeheartedly comfort and send off your return home》

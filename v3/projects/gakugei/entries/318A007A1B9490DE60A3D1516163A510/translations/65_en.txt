Rain Bell (Urinrei) - On the night of Rain Bell, returning to Qin　Still seeing Zhang Hui's single piece anew
　　　　Long speaking of the Emperor shedding tears while teaching　The moon is bright and there is no one left in the Southern Palace

Commentary: Long ago, Emperor Xuanzong composed the Rain Bell melody during his journey through Shu, and remembering that night of singing it, he has now returned to the capital of Qin. When ordered to play that piece again, the court musician Zhang Hui performed it once more, and it sounded even more sorrowfully fresh. Regarding this piece, Zhang Hui would often tell how Emperor Xuanzong, with tears streaming down, taught him this melody over and over again. Now, playing it through this bright moonlit night in the Xingqing Palace of the Southern Palace, neither Xuanzong who sang this piece nor Noble Consort Yang are present, and with no one to listen, it sounds all the more sorrowful.

Liangzhou Song, Second Movement

The north wind blows the leaves in autumn at Yan Gate
Ten thousand li of smoke and dust darken the garrison towers
The war horses long contemplate above the Blue Sea
At night the barbarian flute is heard at the peak of Long Mountain

《Commentary: Since it is autumn, the north wind also blows and scatters the tree leaves, and around Yan Gate Prefecture it is an autumn scene. This is the time when the barbarians (foreign tribes) rise up, and the barbarian peoples raise smoke and dust across ten thousand li with ceaseless battles. They attack so close that even our garrison towers are darkened. While I constantly think about whether to ride out today or tomorrow to defend against the barbarians who have come to the Blue Sea area, the sound of the barbarian flute can be heard close by around Long Mountain》

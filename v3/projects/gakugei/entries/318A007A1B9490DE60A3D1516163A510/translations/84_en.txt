Palace Poem

The palace gates have long been closed, and the dancing robes are dusty
I can roughly perceive that the sovereign's temples have already turned gray
Instead, I envy the falling flowers of spring, which without concern
Can flow along the imperial canal and reach the human world

《Commentary: As for myself, I am no longer favored by the emperor's affection, so the palace gates remain closed and have never been opened, and since my dancing robes are never worn to appear before the emperor, they are left unused and I have much idle time. "Roughly" means that while I do not know the situation with certainty, I generally understand it. If the Son of Heaven were young, I might still be employed, but since the sovereign's temples are streaked with white hair and he has aged, there will likely be no more imperial favor. What I find enviable about this is that these flowers, even when they fall, are blamed by no one and can freely follow the wind, flowing out with the water of the imperial canal, while I, having once been touched by the sovereign's hand, cannot go out into the human world and must grow old within the palace》

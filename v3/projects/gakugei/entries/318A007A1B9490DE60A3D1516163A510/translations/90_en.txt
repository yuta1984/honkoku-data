《Commentary: Tonight the sky has cleared, so even the moon appears, with few stars visible, and frost fills the fields. In the depths of night, the barbarians (non-Chinese peoples) take advantage of this moonlit night, riding in felt-covered wagons and camping around Mount Yin near the Chinese border, rattling their weapons with intent to invade China. This is because there are no good generals in the capital like the ancient General Li Guang. Knowing this, the Chanyu's barbarian tribes openly and boldly show no fear of China, playing their reed pipes called hujia while letting their horses graze, thus showing contempt for China. If there were a good general, they would fear his authority, but the absence of such a general is regrettable. ○The character "openly" includes reference to the hujia within its meaning》

　Song of the Barbarian Reed Pipe (Hujia)

The moon bright, stars few, frost
fills the fields
Felt wagons lodge at night beneath
Mount Yin
Since the Han dynasty lost
General Li
The Chanyu openly comes
to pasture horses

Night Rain - Sent to the North　by Li Shangyin

You ask when I'll return, but there's no fixed date yet
Night rain on Ba Mountain fills the autumn pond to overflowing
When shall we together trim the candle by the west window
And speak again of this time of Ba Mountain's night rain

Commentary: From over there, you sent word asking when I would return, but I still don't know when I might go back. Around Ba Mountain tonight it is lonely, with rain falling and water levels rising, flooding the autumn pond. Living amidst this scenery, I too wish to return home quickly someday, and together trim the wick of the candle by the west window, telling stories of tonight's lonely travel hardships under Ba Mountain's night rain. But since I don't know when I might return, such hopes cannot be counted upon.

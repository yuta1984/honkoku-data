Song of Jiangnan
　　　Zhang Chao
The arrowhead leaves withered when we parted at West Bay　The lotus flowers bloom but he still hasn't returned
My dreams never leave the waters by the river　People say my lord is at Phoenix Mountain

[Commentary: Last year I parted from my husband at the end of autumn when the arrowhead leaves were withering at this West Bay, but a full year has already passed and though it's now the height of lotus blooming season, he still hasn't returned. My heart, whether in dreams or waking, never leaves the waters of West Bay where we parted last year, and I always think of him as vividly as if seeing him with the same feelings from when we parted. Recently I hear people saying that my husband is around Phoenix Mountain, and like the harmonious pair of male and female phoenixes, he has found another intimate companion there and has forgotten about me. If such a thing were true, how resentful I would be - what an untrustworthy and unconscionable person he would be - such is the meaning of this poem.] [Illustration]

On Hearing that Bai Letian was Demoted to Jiangzhou Sima - by Yuan Zhen

The remaining lamp has no flame, shadows dim and indistinct
This evening I hear you are banished to Jiujiang
Near death in illness, I startle and sit up
Dark wind blows rain into the cold window

《Commentary: "Chuangchuang" means unclear in appearance. The lamp at dawn has no flame and is about to go out, so the shadow is also dimly dark and melancholy as I sit facing it. Why is this? Because this evening I heard that my poetry friend Bai Letian has been demoted to Jiangzhou, and thinking of his state of mind, I cannot sleep through the night, spending it in worried contemplation. I myself have been seriously ill lately and can hardly move, but upon hearing this news I was so shocked that I jumped up. Looking outside, it is pitch dark, and at this moment wind is blowing and rain is falling, with a terrible draft coming into my room at dawn. He will likely be setting out on his journey, and how sorrowful it must be, yet I cannot go to meet him - what a regrettable thing this is》

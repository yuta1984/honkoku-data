Ascending the Tower

Sparse sophora and willows encircle the prefectural city, night adds mountain rain to create river sounds
In autumn wind the southern roads have no carriages or horses, alone I ascend the high tower with feelings for my homeland

《Commentary: Since it is autumn time, the leaves of sophora and willows have fallen, sparsely and desolately surrounding the prefectural city. Even normally the river's sound is loud, but because rain has fallen, the voice is even higher and awesome. In this autumn season, if there were visitors I could speak with them for comfort, but around the southern roads there are no carriages or horses—so lonely. I alone ascend to the top of the tower, and in my loneliness I recall my homeland and feel unbearable melancholy》【Illustration】

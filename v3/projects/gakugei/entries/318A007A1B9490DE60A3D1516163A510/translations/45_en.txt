Song of the Willow Branch

At Emperor Yang's temporary palace by the Bian River, several willow trees seem unable to bear the beauty of spring
When evening comes and the wind rises, the flowers fall like snow, flying into the palace walls where no one can be seen

《Commentary: Long ago, Emperor Yang opened the Bian Canal and frequently made imperial visits to palaces there. He also loved willows, so the several willow trees planted along this Bian River bank would sprout and turn green in spring, unable to bear the beauty of spring as everything became spring-like. When viewed at dusk, the wind would rise and scatter the willow flowers like snow, flying wildly into the palace walls, but there was no one to appreciate them. In the past, during Emperor Yang's prosperous times, it would have been quite different - this is a lament reflecting on the past》

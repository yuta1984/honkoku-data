Hu Weizhou (Ko Ishū)　Zhang You (Chō Yū) [possibly Zhang Hu]

The solitary moon stands high and illuminates the traveling boat; the vast Yangtze River flows for ten thousand li in solitude. Not knowing where one's homeland lies, the endless mountains and clouds cause one to grieve.

[Commentary]
"Standing high" refers to the moon hanging in the high sky illuminating the boat on which one travels. Throughout this night, everything is desolately quiet and lonely. Traveling along the flow of the ten-thousand-li Yangtze River makes for an increasingly melancholy journey. Traveling across such vast waters, one cannot tell where one's homeland might be—though one looks, it cannot be seen. Only the mountains and clouds stretch endlessly, layer upon layer without end, increasing the traveler's sorrow.

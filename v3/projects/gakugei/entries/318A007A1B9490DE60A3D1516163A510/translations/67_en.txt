Crossing the Sanggan River

Guest lodging in Bingzhou, already ten winters have passed
My heart yearning for home, day and night I remember Xianyang
Without reason I cross the waters of Sanggan again
Looking back, Bingzhou itself has become my native place

By Jia Dao

Commentary: I too have abandoned my beloved hometown and have been living in travelers' lodgings in Bingzhou for about ten years now. Having grown weary of travel, I have recently developed a longing for home and day and night think constantly of my hometown, the capital of Xianyang, wanting desperately to return. Without any particular reason, I find myself crossing the Sanggan River once more, and when I look back, even Bingzhou where I had been staying appears distant. Having come to this place, my hometown is now even more distant and separated, and that Bingzhou has itself become like a hometown, while Xianyang grows ever more distant. Thinking that I remain only in travel this way, not knowing when I might return, my longing grows all the stronger.

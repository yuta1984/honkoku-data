Autumn Thoughts - Xu Hun

In autumn, west wind through jade trees, pillow and mat
Chu clouds and Xiang waters - I remember traveling together
A single song sung loudly covers the bright mirror
Yesterday a youth, today white-haired

[Illustration]

Commentary: This is a poem composed reflecting on the approach of old age, inspired by autumn. When the west wind rises among the beautiful jade trees, I spread a high mat to view the garden scenery and lie down using the coolness as my pillow. This reminds me of my youth. The surface meaning is that when I was young, I traveled and played around the Chu region and along the Xiang River, but now in old age I recall those Chu clouds and Xiang waters where I engaged in romantic pleasures. Now that I have grown so old, I can only lie in bed. There are no more comforts, and I console myself by singing this poem loudly. In my youth I would take out a mirror to admire my appearance, but nowadays I keep the mirror stored away in its box. In the past when I was young I was like this and that, but now I have white hair. How quickly old age comes! Moved by autumn, I cannot bear this sorrow.

Climbing Shòujiàng City at Night and Hearing the Flute

The sand before Húilè Peak is like snow, the moon outside Shòujiàng City is like frost. Not knowing from where the reed pipe is blown, all night long the soldiers yearn for their homeland.

《Commentary: Climbing up to Shòujiàng City at night, the area near Húilè Peak appears pure white with sand like snow. Before my eyes, around Shòujiàng City, the moon shines cold as frost, creating a desolate atmosphere. In this lonely scenery, from somewhere comes the sound of a reed pipe melody. Upon hearing this tune, those who have come here on military campaigns must surely remember their hometowns. It cannot be only myself who feels this way》

Lady Guo (Guo Fujin)

Lady Guo of Guo State receives the sovereign's favor; at dawn she rides her horse and enters the palace gate. She dislikes how rouge and powder would soil her natural complexion, lightly sweeping her moth-like eyebrows before attending upon the Supreme One.

Commentary: This lady too received the loving favor of Emperor Xuanzong. She particularly loved horses, and when dawn broke, she would mount her horse and enter the emperor's palace gate to attend court. While women typically adorn themselves with rouge and powder, this beauty possessed such superior character that she disliked applying makeup. She would simply give her eyebrows a light touch and attend upon the Supreme Emperor. This made her all the more elegant, and her natural complexion was beautiful.

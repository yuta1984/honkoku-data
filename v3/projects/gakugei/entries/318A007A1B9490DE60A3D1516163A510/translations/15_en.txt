Early Autumn at the Military City　Yan Wu

Last night the autumn wind entered Han Pass
Northern clouds and frontier moon fill the Western Mountains
Further urging the flying general to pursue the arrogant enemy
Let not a single horse return from the sandy battlefield

[Commentary: Since last night, autumn winds have been blowing, and the area around Han Pass has also grown cold. As it approaches the season for military campaigns, northern clouds drift across the sky, the frontier moon shines clearly, filling the Western Mountains with an ominous appearance.

At this time, because the barbarian tribes are invading, generals like the "Flying General" are urged and dispatched to drive away the arrogant enemy barbarians who think nothing of attacking the capital. This would be the command issued by the commanding general.]

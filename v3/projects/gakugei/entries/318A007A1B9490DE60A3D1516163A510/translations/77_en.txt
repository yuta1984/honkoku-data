Banqueting with a Border General - Zhang Qiao

A single melody of Liangzhou, gold and stone instruments clear; border winds blow fiercely, shaking the river city
Among the seated guests is one grown old on the battlefield;横flute, cease playing the sounds of the frontier

Commentary: When this single melody of Liangzhou is played with gold and stone instruments, both the tune and sounds are clear and pure, echoing beautifully. At this moment, the harsh winds of the borderlands blow fiercely and ominously, shaking the river city. Among those seated is someone who came to guard this battlefield in his youth and has now grown old here. The horizontal flute inevitably plays the melancholy sounds of the frontier. If one were to hear those sounds, they would be deeply saddening, so please refrain from playing them - thus the general is comforted.

Retiring from Court and Gazing at Mount Zhongnan - Li Zheng

The purple palace court session ends, arranging the mandarin duck and phoenix procession; stopping horses before the Danfeng Tower to look
Only the colors of Mount Zhongnan remain, bright and clear as of old, filling Chang'an

Commentary: Just now, having attended court at the Purple Palace Hall with ceremonies completed, returning in orderly procession like mandarin ducks and phoenixes, when stopping horses around the imperial palace at Danfeng Tower to look, the scenery of the capital has completely changed from ancient times. However, only the colors of Mount Zhongnan remain blue-green, bright and clear as before, unchanging and filling Chang'an, towering majestically from every direction. The state of the court has declined and become desolate.

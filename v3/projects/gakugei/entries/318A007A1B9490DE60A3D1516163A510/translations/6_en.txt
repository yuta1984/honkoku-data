Parting from Dong Da

Yellow clouds for ten li, white sun sets
North wind blows the geese, snow falls densely
Do not grieve that there are no close friends on the path ahead
Who in all the world does not know you?

[Commentary in smaller text: "Ten li" refers to what can be seen stretching to the horizon. Looking around this area, the sky is overcast and threatening snow. As it is the evening of a white day, the north wind blows, sending the geese southward, and indeed the snow falls thickly in this harsh moment when you depart on your journey. "Mo chou" (do not grieve) is a word of comfort. Do not feel sorry that you, parting from close friends like myself, will have no intimate companions on the road ahead. Since you are a person of outstanding character, people along your way will respect and welcome you, so do not worry but go forth with good spirits.]

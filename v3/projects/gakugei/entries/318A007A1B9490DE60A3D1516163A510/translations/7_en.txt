Seeing Off Du Shisi as He Goes to Jiangnan
　　　　　　　　Meng Haoran

Jing and Wu border each other, with water as their homeland
You depart when the spring river is vast and boundless
At sunset, where will your lonely boat find harbor?
Gazing to the ends of the earth breaks one's heart

[Commentary: Wu and Chu are places where people make their homes on the water everywhere. When you depart, you will see that in spring the waters rise and stretch endlessly without bounds. Setting out by boat into such waters, wondering where you will find a place to moor your boat tonight, gazing out to the horizon with no destination in sight, just drifting aimlessly - it breaks one's heart with worry.]

Letter to Han Peng [Commentary: In governing with a peaceful heart, affairs naturally become peaceful. Birds seen flying in the morning return flying at dusk. I send this letter to the magistrate of divine wisdom by the river. I envy your Guye Mountain at the city walls] Li Qi

[Commentary: You serve as a magistrate by the river, but your governance is unhurried, caring for nothing, ruling through non-action, so all things follow naturally and remain peaceful. Having nothing particular to do each day, you find comfort watching the birds that fly out each morning return to their nests at dusk. Since I admire such people, I now send this letter to you who serves as magistrate by the river. You are a magistrate with divine virtue unlike ordinary worldly people. How enviable that near where you reside stands Guye, an immortal dwelling, so that like the divine beings of Guye, you govern through natural non-action with divine virtue.]

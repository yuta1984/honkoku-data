Departing Yuan River at Night, Sent to Attendant Li Yingchuan and Liu
　　　　　　　　　　　　　Dai Shulun

At midnight I turn my boat and enter Chu territory, where the moon shines bright and mountains and water
are both verdant. A solitary monkey cries further in the autumn wind—
even one who is not troubled would feel heartbroken

《Commentary: At midnight, turning the boat's direction toward Chu territory, the sky is clear and the moon bright, with mountains reflected in the water, both appearing verdant together. Moreover, in the autumn wind, a lone monkey cries mournfully. If this affects even travelers at an inn, then even those without worries would feel melancholy, and much more so for people like us who are deeply saddened》【Illustration】

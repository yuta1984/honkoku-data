　　In the Lake
By the shores of Qingcao Lake, the sunlight hangs low, and in the yellow grass thickets, partridges cry
A man adrift in wandering, my present state is thus　I sing a long song by the western waters of Chu

《Commentary: Around Qingcao Lake, as the sun tilts toward evening, unfamiliar birds not seen in the capital are crying among the yellow grass. Never did I think I would come to such a place—what a desolate place I find myself in! I too am a man who aspired to achieve merit and rise to high position, but having fallen into such decline with no way to console myself, I compose this song and sing it by the western waters of Chu, only to dispel the sorrow in my heart.》

Wandering in the Han Palace Gardens　by Zhang Zhongsu

Returning geese fly high from Taiye Pool, new flowers bloom low on the branches of Shanglin Garden
The radiant seasons are worthy of admiration wherever they reach, yet all of humanity remains unaware of spring's beauty

《Commentary: Since it is spring, the geese fly high away from Taiye Pool, returning north. Being the height of spring, new flowers have bloomed on the branches of the garden trees, drooping so low they nearly touch the ground - a magnificent sight. Everywhere this spring light reaches presents scenery worthy of admiration, but since this is the spring beauty of the imperial palace, only the emperor can view it, and no one else among humanity can see it. Another interpretation is that from the emperor down, all of humanity remains unaware, and no one sees these flowers. This also relates to the scenery after times of turmoil》

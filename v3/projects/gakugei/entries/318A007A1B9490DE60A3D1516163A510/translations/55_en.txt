Immediate Affairs in the Prefecture　　　　　Yang Shi'e

Red petals have all fallen yet dark fragrance remains, autumn light on leaves and white dew are cold
The Yue maidens contain boundless emotion—do not let them lean their long sleeves against the balustrade

《Commentary: This was composed when serving as magistrate in Zizhou. The red lotus petals have all fallen completely, and though the flowers have all scattered, somehow their fragrance still lingers. Since it is autumn, the dew on the tree leaves creates an eerily cold atmosphere. If you were to show them these fallen flowers, they would be filled with autumn sentiment and recall various sorrows, so you must not let the long-sleeved beauties lean against the railings to view this scene》

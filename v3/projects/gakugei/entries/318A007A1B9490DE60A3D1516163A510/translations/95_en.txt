In Response to Li Xiucai's "Four Seasons of Resentment at the Border Court"
Lu Bi

In the eighth month frost flies and willows turn yellow everywhere
Wormwood roots are blown away and wild geese fly south
By the flowing water of Long Ridge and under the moon over border mountains
Weeping, I climb Dragon Mound to gaze toward my homeland

《Commentary: In the eighth month, the border fortress differs from China proper - frost falls early, willows turn yellow and scatter everywhere, and it becomes cold. Even the wormwood roots in the desert are blown about by the wind, and wild geese fly south as if in haste. In such a desolate place, one might ask if there is any comfort to be found. To one's ears comes the harsh sound of water from Long Mountain, and to one's eyes the dim, hazy moon over the border mountains. Not knowing when one might return to one's homeland brings overwhelming sadness. Suppressing tears and hoping to find some comfort by at least looking in the direction of home, one climbs to the top of Dragon Mound to gaze toward one's homeland, but it cannot be seen, and the sadness only deepens.》

Water Drum, First Movement

Carved bow with white feather - the hunt returns for the first time
In the evening twilight, cattle and sheep come down again
By the banks of Mengshui River, green grass grows thick
Beyond the peaks of Black Mountain, battle clouds disperse

《Commentary: When the world is turbulent, there is no time for hunting, but now in this peaceful reign, hunters carrying carved bows with white-feathered arrows who went out this morning are returning for the first time at dusk. Since evening twilight comes early, the cattle and sheep left to graze in the wild also come down from the mountains to return home. This too is because when there are no military affairs, war horses are not needed, so they are left to graze freely in the wild. During warfare, grass cannot grow because it gets trampled, but in these peaceful times, grass grows thick everywhere along the banks of Mengshui River. During military campaigns, battle clouds could be seen stretching across the sky around Black Mountain, but now that peace has been restored, those clouds have cleared, and it is a peaceful era》

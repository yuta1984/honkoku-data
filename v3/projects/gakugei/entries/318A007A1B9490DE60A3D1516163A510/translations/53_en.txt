Song of the Frontier Fortress　by Li Yi

Three times I've guarded Yuyang, twice crossed the Liao River
A reddish bow hangs on my arm, arrows lie across my waist
The Xiongnu seem to want to know my name and family
Stop shooting eagles while lurking near Mount Yin

《Commentary: I too have come to guard around this Yuyang area about three times, and have come to guard this Liaodong for the second time now. Since I've come to guard the frontier fortress, I hang my reddish bow on my elbow and keep arrows inserted horizontally at my waist, never letting them leave my body as I remain vigilant. The Xiongnu probably don't know that I've come to guard this time either, but somehow they seem to think "that person comes frequently," and it appears they've learned my name. However, since you come to guard duty so often, it's not something to speak of your name lightly or act carelessly about. If you dare come to the Tang border mountains under the pretext of shooting eagles and step into our capital's territory, we will certainly launch a punitive expedition - this is a threat》

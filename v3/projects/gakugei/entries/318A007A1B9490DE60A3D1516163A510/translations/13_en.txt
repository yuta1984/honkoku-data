Song of a Young Man
　　　Wu Xiangzhi
Receiving imperial favor, borrowing hunting grounds at Little
Pingjin, using his influence,
Constantly playing with court
nobles, throwing away a thousand
gold coins in one bet, his whole body is pure courage,
His house has no four walls
Yet he knows not poverty.

[Commentary: Little Pingjin refers to the fief of Gongsun Hong. This refers to borrowing the prime minister's fief. The foolish young men of the capital, receiving the emperor's favor, borrow the prime minister's lands as if they were their own hunting grounds, and hunt there for amusement. Acting willfully with great arrogance, they do not associate with lowly people. They become intimate with the sons of neighboring nobles and the like. Playing so extravagantly, they reach the extreme of pride, gambling and throwing away thousands of gold coins in a single bet, but since their whole body is made of courage, they think nothing of it. Thus associating with court nobles and reaching the extreme of extravagance, though their dwellings may lack even doors and paper screens, there are many such frivolous people who pay no heed to such poverty.] [Illustration]

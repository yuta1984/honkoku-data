"Ascending the Tower, Sent to Lord Wang" by Wei Yingwu

Treading the pavilion and climbing through the forest, I lament we cannot be together
Thoughts of Chu clouds and vast seas know no end
The sounds of fulling blocks from several houses echo below the autumn mountains
Thorns and brambles of the entire district lie in the cold rain

《Commentary: Since the district magistrate was not assigned to a prosperous place but sent to such a desolate location, this poem contains feelings of melancholy》

《Commentary: Wei Yingwu composed this while serving as district magistrate, climbing the tower. ○Since the pavilion protrudes from within the forest, it is described this way. Viewed from the high chamber, it appears below and seems as if one has climbed up - it's a tall pavilion. It would be interesting if you could climb up together, but it's regrettable that we cannot enjoy ourselves together. You are in the direction of Chu clouds, while we are by the vast sea, separated from each other, unable to be in the same place, so various memories come to mind. Climbing the tower and looking around, everywhere the sounds of fulling blocks can be heard, echoing below the autumn mountains with melancholy. "One district" refers to a village in the countryside. Thorns and brambles grow wild and chaotic, among useless weeds, appearing desolate in the rain. This poem expresses that it wouldn't be like this if viewed together with you》

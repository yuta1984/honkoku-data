Listening to the Horn, Thinking of Return
By Gu Kuang

In my old garden, yellow leaves
Must be filling the green moss.
After dreams, atop the city walls,
I grieve at the dawn horn's sound.
On this night, the heartbroken man
Is not seen; rising and walking,
The remaining moon's shadow wanders.

《Commentary: Since this is also autumn, the tree leaves have turned yellow and fallen, and green moss must be growing everywhere in the garden. With no one to sweep and clean, it must surely be in ruins, he thinks with sorrow. Upon waking, he hears the mournful sound of the barbarian flute at dawn, stirring up the traveler's melancholy. Hearing this melody, with no one to share his sadness, sunk in grief and unable to sleep, he walks here and there, but wherever he goes the moon's reflection can be seen, making his sorrow ever greater.》

Lodging at Zhaoying
Emperor Wu prays to the spirits
At the Taiyi Altar.
The tree colors of Xinfeng
Surround a thousand officials.
How could one know that tonight
At Changsheng Palace
It would be closed alone
In the empty mountains,
With the moon's cold shadow?

《Commentary: Long ago, just as Emperor Wu of Han built an altar to worship the heavenly spirits, Emperor Xuanzong also had shrines built, and in those days when Xuanzong made his imperial visits, around Xinfeng Palace among the tree shadows and forest groves, officials stood guard in magnificent splendor. But who would have thought that tonight, seeing the state of this Changsheng Palace, unlike in ancient times it stands closed, with no one coming and going, no one to view the moon—how desolate it is! Thus he laments, reminiscing about the past.》

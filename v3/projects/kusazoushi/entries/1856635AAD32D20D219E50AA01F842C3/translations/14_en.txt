How strange and
peculiar it is,
beyond description.
Whenever I go
out for pleasure,
I never
succeed in being popular. Naturally,
being an unattractive man who knows nothing
of contemporary fashion, and moreover
being taciturn with poor
social graces at banquets, I envy
those who go out and have
enjoyable times.
Wishing that at least
once I could
play and be popular,

and went out for pleasure, whereupon
at the first meeting

I have never heard
of laughing.
Even if I lined up
a fortune of one hundred ryō
counting one-two-three,
I wonder if such feelings of triumph
could even move me.

Tomorrow
evening
when the priest
Tamachi no
Hōin
comes,
it would be
good. What
shall we do?
It's foolish
not to listen.

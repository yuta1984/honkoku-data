The wet nurse, seeing
that the two had
come to visit,
was shocked
and shed tears.

the joy of

struggling to make ends meet,
and would never

I suffer hardship. I've been
so remiss in keeping in touch
that I knew nothing
of these circumstances.
How good that you have come!"

She cared for them
in various ways.

The wet nurse's son, a local

quite
beautiful.

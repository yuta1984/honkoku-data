Here there is a man called Kuramaya Kinzō.
His father, with his fat padded leather
gaiters, earned gold and silver
like mountains
and bequeathed them,
so there was nothing dark about
his life. Though he never
earned a single mon,
he believed that rice
comes from
the rice chest,
and money
is something that
exists in the money
box.
With such thinking,
his conduct became
dissolute,
and he simply lived
his life steadily.
But suddenly
his chronic condition
became afflicted with
the disease called "disease."
This illness, though he knows more about it than doctors,
occurs only
in households
above the middle class.
Though it's not
particularly interesting,
he has no inclination
to go
anywhere.

Now, O-Kiyo,

The person knows nothing of pain or itching.
Those below the middle class wear
lined kimono even in summer, and in winter
layer haori jackets,
appearing like pretentious connoisseurs. The doctor's
diagnosis sees it as irritability,
and though he makes efforts, things don't go as intended.
A little
consultation elsewhere
and taking
leave

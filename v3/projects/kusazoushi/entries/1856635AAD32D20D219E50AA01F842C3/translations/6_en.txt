Though it's a mountain of gold
higher than Mount Fuji,
since there's nothing else
comparable to it,
when lent out,
within three hours
the money spending
and revelry
have passed,
and things
flow away
faster than a deep river.
At the very least, not even one person
comes to collect payment.
Looking at the account
books,
it's ten billion
ryō, but
gradually he's troubled by lack of money,
and has begun to
inquire about familiar
pawnshop connections.

Kinzō has
squandered his fortune
within three hours
and has come to be troubled
even by the manner
of a tofu seller's
entrance.
He has sold off
even the household goods
he had brought
for his livelihood.
Truly, that so-called
face of prosperity
is actually as described
[unclear text]
and somehow
those from whom he
borrowed—temples and
whatnot—won't help at all.
It's utterly useless.
　♪ For a debt of two hundred ryō,
　　please lend just one bu,
　　　　　　　　I beseech you.

If you sell
this
short
sword,
I'll
lend
to you.
What a
shame,
though.

It becomes extremely
crowded.

When Kinzō
began using the incantation
bestowed upon him
by Bishamonten,
first, before even
twelve repetitions,
the effectiveness is beyond
anything that could be
compared.
Like a thin board nailed
with a five-inch nail,
his wishes and desires are easily fulfilled.
Naturally achieving success and advancement,
the food he wants to eat and
the things he desires are mysteriously
granted, so that amazement
becomes the norm - this was
the beginning.

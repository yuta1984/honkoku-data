Kinzō, in his distress,
encountered thieves at
the wet nurse's house, and due to this misfortune
was on the verge of losing both
his life and spirit.
He thought it would be better to die than
to have his face seen by people of the world
in such a fallen state.
But as in the jōruri of Shunkan,
"Still, such is the sadness of life,"
the two companions
set out together. Strangely,
from the direction ahead, a person
wearing armor suddenly appeared and said:
"Ho there, Kinzō! Even hermit sages
are ancient things. Appearing in dreams is also
an old custom. I have appeared
here before you.
Rumble, rumble, rumble, like
an earthquake
writhing in agony.
You have
for many years
truly believed in me.

"Your kindness
in some way
is most gratefully
received.
Your facial expression
shows no
sly grin.

I would lend you
at least two or three ryō, but
centipedes have
many

legs.

Don't call me
Kurama-ya
because it damages my reputation.
Therefore, I shall bestow
something upon you. 'Walls have
ears, and earthworks have
mouths.' Put your ear
here," and he bestows
something upon him.

"But these
are
useless,"
he said. "Since
Lord Bisha-
mon
commanded it,
centipede
coins are
useless,"
he declared.

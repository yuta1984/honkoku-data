Momotaro's adoptive parents had grown old and now lived peacefully with bodies that could no longer comprehend much. As they gradually aged and returned to their former state, it would be only human nature to think that if they found another peach, they might become young again. But that was no longer possible.

All in all, in Edo there are no mountains to go cut grass, no river shallows for washing clothes. His daughter-in-law Ume was filial, and they lived in such a comfortable world that there was no one who didn't envy them.

Both the old man and woman, being country-raised, had no other pleasures, so they made tending the garden their joy. Since Momotaro was born from a peach, they bought a peach tree - whether from Kayabacho or Yagenbori, no one knows - and they cherish and love it dearly.

"Oh, the tree's form is getting better and better."

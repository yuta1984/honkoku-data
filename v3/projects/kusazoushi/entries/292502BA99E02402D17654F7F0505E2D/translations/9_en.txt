Coming from Oni Island takes many days, so [the oni] came to inquire about the situation. Having called out Okiyo, it was natural, but why make [the situation] drag on? He says, "Even your hands cannot handle this."

"Momotaro-san, how could I, being a woman, become like that?" she says. The oni, perceptive as expected, sees through this: "So you have become infatuated with Momotaro. With such a rotten disposition, [you are] unreliable. On the island, we will all consult together and kill Momotaro." Despite attempts to stop him, he shakes free and leaves.

【Okiyo's dialogue】
"How rash of you! Please wait!"

【Momotaro's dialogue】
"So you are a spy from Oni Island! I shall cross to the island once more and cut down every last one of you!"

When Momotarō returned from Oni Island with countless treasures, the old man and old woman rejoiced like his true parents as before, gradually expressing gratitude to the three companions (monkey, pheasant, and dog), entertaining them with various delicacies and trying to make them stay. Though they said "Please come here anytime," all of them had wives and children, so they said they must return home, and they desired none of the many treasures.

This is because birds and beasts are quite carefree when it comes to money and gold.

[Monkey's dialogue]
When I eat, my face turns completely white.

[Pheasant's dialogue]
Tomorrow we should depart. I can fly back so it's fine for me, but it will be troublesome for you two. Like the pheasant of the burnt fields or the crane of the night, I am especially eager because I think of my children.

[Old man's dialogue]
Please, have some more.

[Main text]
Since they accompanied him to Oni Island for just one dumpling each and returned, he prepared quite a feast and entertained them, making it an incomparable banquet.

[Old woman's dialogue]
You know, though they say dogs and monkeys are natural enemies, these two get along so well. And how comfortable the pheasant seems with them. What an unusual friendship this is.

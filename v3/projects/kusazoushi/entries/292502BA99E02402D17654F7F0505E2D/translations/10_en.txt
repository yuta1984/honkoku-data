Okiyo had come to retrieve the treasure, but having fallen in love with Momotaro, her scheming came to nothing. Since the oni on Oni Island now say they will kill Momotaro, this too is sorrowful, but Momotaro saying he will go to Oni Island again, and the troubles of his adoptive parents in the village being sorrowful as well, she began to think ill thoughts.

Though her love would not be fulfilled, without any excuse to offer to Lady Ume, she took matters into her own hands, writing "Please somehow save my parents' lives," left this note, and committed suicide. There was no one who did not feel pity for her. Though her face was that of an oni, she was gentle-hearted. In these times when some have beautiful faces but hearts like oni, her gentleness was remarkable.

Momotaro felt great pity.

【Okiyo's dialogue】
"Please hear my request. There is nothing left in my heart now. Namu Amida Butsu, Namu Amida Butsu."

【Man's dialogue】
"Oh my, what a pitiful thing. We would like to help her achieve peaceful rebirth so she won't wander lost, but we lack the spiritual power."

【Written note】
Various matters in this note. Though it is shameful to speak of personal matters, I am the daughter of oni. Though I came to retrieve the treasure as instructed, I fell in love with you, my lord. I have no excuse to offer Lady Ume. Please somehow save my parents' lives - there are countless things I wish to ask, but time presses, so I leave this note. With respectful regards.

【In illustration - Ume's dialogue】
"Seeing this situation, Ume too [observes]: What a gentle, filial child. There would have been ways to make amends without dying. Indeed, for oni hands, this was skillfully done," she says with admiration.

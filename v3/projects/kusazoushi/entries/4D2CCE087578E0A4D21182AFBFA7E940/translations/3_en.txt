In recent years, supernatural beings have fallen into such decline that it surpasses even the decline of the great Meijima Shippo, and since this makes things quite boring, they decided to organize a small gathering for three rounds. The various chaotic ways of haunting differ from one to another. This is called a "monster meeting" (a pun on "gathering").

Starting with Kurosuke, along with Sodesuri, Matsuzaki Sugi no Mori, and others - foxes that choose no particular location, as well as foxes from various other places - all rushed to gather first. However, Mikoshi Nyudo, being of the first rank, was considered too vulgar and thus did not join this gathering.

"Ah, I've become sleepy. Shall I go fetch something from Musashiya?"

A lady-in-waiting from the inner quarters came with five ryō, so they arranged a marriage proposal. The man's appearance was like a combination of Mon-no-suke and Sōjūrō's facial features, with the stylish qualities of Kōshirō and Matsusuke, plus Nakazō's bitter edge. When he spoke of wanting to live in a thousand-ryō mansion with a hundred rooms, the parents were convinced and began preparing for the wedding. When they inquired about the other party's background, they were initially rejected as unsuitable. However, not to mention the combs, hairpins, and kosode robes, everything was prepared down to the Ueda-jima striped fabric for going to the public bath and geta sandals with Sanada cords, completing the daughter's trousseau.

[Dialogue]
"If the prospective partner is truly a serious man as you say, then naturally... he must... perform his duties here properly."

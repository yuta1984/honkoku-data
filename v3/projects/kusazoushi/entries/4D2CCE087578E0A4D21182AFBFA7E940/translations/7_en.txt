An anma (massage therapist) and acupuncturist, ashamed of the fee for shoulder and back massage, pays sixteen mon.
Next is the second performance, a new kyōgen play. Having entered for one act with sixteen mon, he sees the familiar actors' faces. Here, to the fox's advantage, Rokō and Jakaku appear beautifully dressed, and seeing the master's exquisite performance for the first time, he sheds tears of admiration, saying "How interesting!" Unintentionally watching two acts costs thirty-two mon. "Since I cannot see, I only listen," he says, getting a sixteen mon discount. "How perceptive," they respond.
One act is cheap indeed. The person who made fun of the fox was made blind.

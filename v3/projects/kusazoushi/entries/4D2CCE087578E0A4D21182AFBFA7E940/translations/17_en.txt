The men were terribly dissolute and wanted to play as they pleased, so the two of them borrowed ten ryō for a five-day period. He became intimate with a courtesan called "Kuzu-no-ha" (Arrowroot Leaves) at the Tamaya, but when he heard that Kuzu-no-ha was also seeing another man, he initially felt jealous and angry. When he bought the services of a courtesan called "Tamamo" at the rival establishment, he was entertained with expensive hospitality and such. Even Ariwara no Narihira would flee barefoot to Musashino, and even Hikaru Genji would hide under the veranda in such circumstances.

Thinking "this is quite amusing indeed," the five-day term quickly arrived and the promised deadline passed, so he was pressed for payment by the moneylender. Hearing the amount was ten ryō and having no choice, both sets of parents each contributed ten ryō. When they returned ten ryō to the moneylender, ten ryō remained afterward. Indeed, this fellow made a profit from it.

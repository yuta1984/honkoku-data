A head clerk took one bu and went to what seemed like Fukagawa, had a lavish stylish meal, and went to the bedroom. When his partner, a prostitute, tried to go relieve herself, she accidentally had her tail spotted.

"This one is a fox! To bewitch people is to make fools of them. If there's any reputation left, what a brazen creature this is!" So he dismissed her and called for another girl, which was a gain of two bu.

"Get rid of that one!"

"Yes, sorry, sorry! I won't do such things again from now on!"

"Showing her tail - what a good laugh!"

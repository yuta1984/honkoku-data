Third year of Tenmei (1783)

【Left page】
Every year, the same kinds of monster books appear, and they've all become equally boring. Even the boss of the Mikoshi-nyūdō has become quite a tedious creature. So this year, an old fox came up with an idea to give the Mikoshi-nyūdō the ultimate squeeze, and they're having a discussion about it.

"Listen here, old tanuki, what do you think? That Mikoshi-nyūdō fellow wants to act like the head of all monsters, but all he ever does is bob his head around. Even humans can do that much - it's just a sickness that makes people lose their livelihood by failing to properly frighten anyone. Now I, on the other hand, can transform into anything as desired, so shapeshifting is truly my specialty."

"Indeed, that's quite right. How about we form a conspiracy and give him a proper squeeze?"

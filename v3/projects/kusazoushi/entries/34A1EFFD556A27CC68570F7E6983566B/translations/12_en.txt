After that, the fox left the group of yōkai, leaped over countless torii gates, and is now called Inari Daimyōjin, becoming a protective deity for humans.

As for the snow woman following the fox, this seemed like a lie at first, but it appears to be true. When children say "yuki konkon" (snow falling heavily) when it snows, perhaps it became "konkon" (the sound foxes make). Well, please think about this as you will.

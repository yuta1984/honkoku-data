Then Kintoki entered between them, trying to make peace between both sides by explaining various reasons, which was quite laborious work for an old man.

Indeed, it is reasonable for the fox and tanuki to say that Mikoshi-nyūdō is not a yōkai. However, since anything can transform and shapeshift, it is also understandable to think that foxes and tanuki are the leaders of yōkai. The reason is that they can transform freely - it is said that long ago, one even transformed into a pickled plum and was eaten by a human. Looking at it this way, while they are yōkai no less capable than each other, Mikoshi-nyūdō has been known since ancient times as the general of yōkai, as you children well know, so it would be difficult to suddenly designate the fox as the leader. Tanuki are one thing, but foxes have attained supernatural powers, so if they don't use this威光 (supernatural authority) to shapeshift, they need not submit to Mikoshi-nyūdō's rule. For all others, from now on, starting with the tanuki and their companions, they shall submit to Mikoshi-nyūdō's rule.

Since it is New Year, the monsters from various provinces are going to pay their New Year's respects to Mikoshi-nyūdō.

Never before has anyone seen the true virtue of Mikoshi-nyūdō receiving such formal respect. The light blue kamishimo ceremonial dress and the suō-eboshi caps worn by the monsters are quite an unusual sight.

【Monsters' dialogue】
We, the various monsters, offer our New Year's greetings.

【Left page, Mikoshi's dialogue】
I find you all most auspicious. Usually the foxes and tanuki appear first, but this year I haven't seen them yet. Have any of you spotted them?

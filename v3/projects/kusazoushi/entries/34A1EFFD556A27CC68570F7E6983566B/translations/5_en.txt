Mikoshi-nyūdō, noticing that the fox, tanuki, cat-demon, river otter, rokurokubi, and others had not come for New Year's visits, waited for spring and secretly peered from the front. When he discovered they were plotting to destroy him, he decided to use a stratagem against the fox and tanuki. He summoned Yuki-onna (Snow Woman), the daughter of Dōdō-jii, and briefed her on his plan.

【Mikoshi-nyūdō's dialogue】
"Now, now, Yuki-onna, use your feminine charms to seduce the fox and tanuki, then strike down the fox. Without carrying this dagger, there is nothing that can match severing a neck. If you understand, I will reward you handsomely. Hurry, hurry!"

【Yuki-onna's dialogue】
"Yes, I understand completely. I shall accomplish this crucial mission you have just commanded with the utmost care."

【Mikoshi-nyūdō's aside】
"That fox doesn't seem to be the type who dislikes women. Seduce him thoroughly."

【Yuki-onna's parent (Dōdō-jii)'s dialogue】
"Listen, daughter, this is an important mission. This could be the salvation of us husband and wife. See it through to the end."

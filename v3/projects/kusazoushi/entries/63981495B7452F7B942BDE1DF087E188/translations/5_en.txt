The badger transforms into the Tiger Stone.

【Traveler at the right edge's dialogue】
"This is neither tiger nor stone, it's a monster! Let's run, let's run!"

"It's not the Tiger Stone but a 'dora stone' (meaning unclear). The luggage has disappeared. We should flee - how I long for Ōiso."

【Man trying to lift the stone that the badger transformed into】
"Somehow it's moving restlessly. They say this is the Tiger Stone where Lady Tora became stone. It's soft to the touch and feels mysterious, each thinking their own thoughts."

"I've stared at it intently. This thing is all appearance - it probably can't be lifted by any means."

【Fox's dialogue】
"First, we did it! (Got money from) a well-stuffed purse."

【Raccoon Dog's dialogue】
"First, let's steal the furoshiki bundle."

【Horse driver's dialogue】
"The horse is precious. Even if trampled, it's fine. What an intensely foul smell this is! Like the demons of Shuten-dōji glaring. This must surely be like a dragon rising up."

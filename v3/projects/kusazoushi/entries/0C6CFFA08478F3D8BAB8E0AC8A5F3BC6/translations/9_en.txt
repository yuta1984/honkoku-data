Ibaraki Gemba received a sacred sword from Tokiakira, but since it was not something a commoner should possess, it would not leave his arm. Unable to accomplish anything, he became a palanquin bearer and encountered Sakin'go (Left Guards Officer), who was searching for the sacred sword. As they fought over whether to hand it over, Watanabe (Tsuna) emerged from inside the palanquin, obtained the sacred sword, and departed. Ōe no Sakin'go pursued Watanabe.

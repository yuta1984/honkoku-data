Long, long ago, in times long past,
there was a place called Mori Village
in a remote countryside area.
In the mountains behind
Mori Village, there was
a large temple, but greatly
deteriorated and ancient,
which had now become
a dwelling place
for monsters.
No matter what monks
were sent there, none could
spend even one night, and gradually
the monsters

multiplied.
Lamenting that this would lead
to the decline of the land,
the villagers wondered how
they might identify the true nature
of these creatures and send
a good monk to
rebuild the temple,
which would bring
prosperity to
the area, and so
they consulted together.

♪If it is our wish,
in any case,
a great monk,
a prestigious and renowned
monk is needed,
or else no matter
how many times (we try)...

♪The village headman
and others
consulted:
"Should the monk
named Jōun
go there?
We respectfully ask,
what shall we do?"

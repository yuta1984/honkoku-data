In the vicinity of the village,
a monk named Jōun
gathered the local
troublemakers to go
and investigate
the monsters.

What kind of monsters are they?
These days there are no
old-fashioned monsters!

♪If you succeed,
the temple
will be
yours—
what a fine
arrangement!

♪No matter how much
you
boast,
it would be good
if things
go
as planned.

Be
care-
ful!
I
too
will
go!

♪Thus the villagers
accompanied Jōun
[the monk's name] to
the old temple.

This is the temple—
it's terribly run down!
It already seems
quite frightening.

♪Be
care-
ful!
Soon
I'll become
the head priest
and show
you!

Master Jōun,
don't get
eaten
head first!

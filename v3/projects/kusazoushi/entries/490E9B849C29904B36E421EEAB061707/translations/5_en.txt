The monk and the spirits recognize each other as
Namu Amida Butsu
Namu Amida Butsu

Jōun finds that
teaching/converting them
is difficult, so
barely escaping
with his life
he flees back

Coming to such a strange place,
he encountered
terrible experiences

Now,
catching his breath,
let him have
a drink

♪If it's dark,
let's light the lanterns
and look carefully
as we go

Yes,
the existence that came
from Ōashi
[unclear syllables]
please let me
receive
it

Being kicked
and trampled,
Oh Yasha and
Myōō,
please help
me, help me!

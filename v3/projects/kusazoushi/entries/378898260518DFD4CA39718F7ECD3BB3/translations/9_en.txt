Here in the vicinity of Kiyosu in Owari Province, there was a slug boss who tormented those who had struck the Bell of Avīci Hell. His character was bold and he favored imposing authority. With great power, he subjugated neighboring provinces and nearby territories, set up checkpoints at every exit from his domain, captured passing monks and chained them in prison. When it came time for ancestral Buddhist services, he would release them to perform thousand-monk memorial services.

"Hey, you think you can escape by running away? You don't stand a chance! It's just like being caught by a shinzō apprentice at Yoshiwara's Great Gate. Come now, come here right away - chiri chiri chiri!"

"Hey now, don't fool around badly like that. It's all the more irritating!"

"Excuse me, though it's vulgar to mention, I have diarrhea, so I'll just go to the toilet for a moment."

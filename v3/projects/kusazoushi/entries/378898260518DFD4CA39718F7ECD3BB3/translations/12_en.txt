When the slug monster ordered that they should count how many trees there were on Mount Komaki, everyone tried to count but became confused and couldn't figure it out at all. At this time, the snake gathered an enormous number of fellow serpents, determined their exact count, had them wrap around the trees one by one, then counted the remaining snakes to determine the number of trees - this display of cleverness was truly remarkable.

From then on, the snake was appointed as construction magistrate and undertook to complete the castle construction within three days. He called together all the master carpenters, day laborers, and helpers, assigned them their duties, instructed them on how to proceed with the construction work, and ordered them to complete it skillfully within three days without fail.

"Work diligently! In return, I'll make sure you get proper rewards. Fresh lacquer and good foundation materials. You must never waste time or slack off!"

The slug monster general particularly favored impressive displays of authority. When traveling to other provinces and neighboring territories, he would arrange his many rokurokubi (long-necked goblins) in the style of long-handled spears, having them extend their necks and form countless rows in double file as his procession passed through.

"Ugh, how annoying! That damn kite has dropped its droppings again!"

"My, my, what a tremendous number of rokurokubi! How well they're all arranged. Well I never, how impressive, quite admirable!"

"But in exchange, there's not a single good-looking neck among them. They're all necks with no aesthetic appeal whatsoever."

"Come now, how is this? The rear is getting backed up. Is there much more ahead? If we stick together too much, the necks are likely to get all tangled up."

"Hey, boss, turn this way a little! You don't know how to get along with others."

"Ah, my neck has gotten tired. I want to hurry to the next resting place. I need to retract it a bit and rest."

Well, well, somehow or other we have managed to put together the story up to this point. From now on, we will present to you this sequel in three volumes. Though these are truly crude monsters that may not catch your eye, we humbly request that our patron children take their time to view this work leisurely. For this reason, we are most grateful and apologetic.

All's well that ends well.

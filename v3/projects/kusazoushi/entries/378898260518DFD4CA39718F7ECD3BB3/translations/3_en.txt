【Framed】Opening
The author having
a dream is
also a common
device, though old-
fashioned, but this time
it came from a real
dream about insects that must
be written whether one likes it or not, which is
First, to author
Ikku came
the publisher
of kusazōshi (popular fiction)
Yamaguchiya, saying
this year
make the insect collection
into monsters
deciding on frogs,
snakes, and
slugs - write about the conflict
of these three creatures.
This order - Ikku, with his usual
greed, swallowing everything,
said "This year I've also raised
your writing fee,
so you must write especially well.
I'll think about it right away" and accepted.

However,
no ideas
came at all, and tired
from thinking,
he dozed off
drowsily.
In his dream
he indeed
saw the conflict
of the three creatures,
and thought "Rather than
a monster collection,
I'll write about
a war of insects,"
hitting upon this idea
and settling on
this concept.

【Right page bottom, woman's dialogue】
Listen, get up
already! A letter
has come from
Lady Ochika.

With me staying
here like this,
it somehow looks
bad, as if I were
the mistress of the house.

【Left page bottom, Ikku's dialogue】
Come, come,
call someone
to be an
attendant -
Oharu or
Ohama, or
perhaps
Tōshirō next?
That would be good.
And tonight
let's skip the usual place
and go to the back
of Tamaya's Michitoshi,
or near Ōmon's
sliding doors,
or perhaps
visit Onoyama
of the pleasure quarters...

Since these are sleep-talking, he speaks freely,
spouting all sorts of nonsense:
"Huff huff, mumble mumble..."

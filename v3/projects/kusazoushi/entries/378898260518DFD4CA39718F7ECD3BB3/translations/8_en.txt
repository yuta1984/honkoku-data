That snake thought "excellent!" and took the fox's six ryō in leaf-coins and fled. However, since they were only leaves, they were worthless. Nevertheless, thinking there might be other good dwelling places, he set out toward the capital.

Resting at a tea shop along the way, he encountered another snake who was a traveling yamabushi (mountain ascetic). This snake looked intently at our snake and said, "How strange indeed! You bear the signs of the Azure Dragon. Though you are now but a lowly small snake, you will eventually become a great serpent, straddle the clouds, soar through the heavens, and become a being of supernatural powers."

Truly, this yamabushi's words were accurate, for snakes know the way of snakes well.

"What's with those snake women - they can just get by however they like. That woman has been giving me disgusting looks and staring at my face intently, damn her!"

"Well, well, acting all 'Namo Buddha' and such, damn her!"

"Let her say that's wonderful - I'll just laugh at her."

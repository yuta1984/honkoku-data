When crossing the Saya River by ferry boat, Nekomata (the cat-demon) left her treasured split hairpin on the boat and lost it. Nekomata greatly regretted this loss and spoke of it to those with whom she was on familiar terms, asking, "If anyone happens to have it, please let me know immediately." Among them, the tanuki (raccoon dog) was somewhat of a jealous type and said, "It must have been that snake from the deep mountains who stole it." Nekomata took this as the truth and became greatly enraged, saying, "That's right! That cursed mountain snake! How can I let this pass?" She reported this matter in detail to General Namekuji (slug) and was working herself up to quickly capture the snake woman and interrogate her.

"We might as well give that rotten snake a good thrashing and surprise her by crying 'Cat! Cat!'"

"Well, well, that snake woman is a brazen one. You can never let your guard down around those who live by being evasive and slippery."

"Since I kept a sharp eye on her before, there's no mistake about it."

"Snakes, you know, love to crawl around in holes by nature, so she probably stole that hairpin intending to go to Okiku of the Dish Mansion or somewhere like that. What an impudent creature!"

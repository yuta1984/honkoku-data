Here lived a kappa by the Okazaki River in Mikawa Province. Having practiced for many years, he had mastered various magical arts and transformations, becoming the leader of monster companions. He commanded many monster subordinates and made his living through highway robbery and theft. One night, when passing over Okazaki Bridge, he found a small snake coiled up and sleeping soundly on the bridge. The kappa inadvertently stepped on its tail as he passed by, whereupon the snake awoke in anger and said, "Who are you to step on my tail and pass by without apology?"

Hearing this, the kappa said, "Well, well, for a mere small snake, you certainly reproach me with spirit! Come with me. You're one with potential. I'll make you my subordinate and put you to work." So saying, he took the small snake home with him.

(Dialogue)
"They say 'a blind snake fears nothing,' so if you were blind I'd forgive you, but I won't let you claim carelessness with those big eyes of yours!"

"This one is most apologetic indeed. Please wait, let me bow down and say 'yes, yes,' I humbly apologize to you."

"No matter how small a snake, one must yield to longer things. You've won this time - look closely and learn!"

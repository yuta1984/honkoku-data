　　Preface

Previously, I wrote a novel called "Kaidan Takara no Hatsuyume" (Ghost Stories: Treasure's First Dream), which fortunately became popular among readers. Now, responding to requests from booksellers, I have titled this work "Ehon Taiheiki" (Illustrated Chronicle of Great Peace) and authored this sequel to the monster tales, preparing it as this year's new publication.

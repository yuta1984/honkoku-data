At the Battle of Sayagawa, the enemy forces initially had great victories and attacked with great momentum. On Namekuji's side, the snake devised strategies, quickly routed the enemy forces, and finally captured their castle, achieving great military fame. From this point, she rose from a low-ranking retainer to become a military strategist. Truly, even when a snake is only an inch long, it shows its spirit, and even when a dragon hides itself like an insect or fish, when the time comes it creates clouds and rain, showing signs of ascending to heaven - this is truly fearsome.

"Hey! Showing your back to the enemy, you coward! Come back, come back!"
"No, that's a lie! Don't come back! Just keep running! That's right, that's right!"

"If we chase them half-heartedly, we can also rest and have a smoke."

"Good, good! Hooray, hooray! Running away is our specialty!"

"I've had measles and it's only been twelve days, so I'd rather not run. I'm getting tired."

The clever monsters know it's time to wash their feet and retire. Farewell!

In the midst of such a dream, Mikosha-nyūdō appeared and said to Ikku: "I understand the concept of an insect collection, but the publisher's order was specifically for a monster collection. While it would be amusing to have slugs and frogs in a monster storybook, you should just bear with that. Since my companions had a hit last year, this year we absolutely must do it with monsters!"

"Where the author's
heart and
my heart
differ, we should
make apologies
to the audience. Come now,
this is the beginning
of the monster storybook!"

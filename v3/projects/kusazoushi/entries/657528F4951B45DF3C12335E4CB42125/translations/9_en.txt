Ise no Jijiro Matakuro, claiming to be Yoshiie,
using the arrowhead
that Muneto shot
to persuade
and plead for the life
of his lord
Sato Muneto

Katsuta no
Jiro
Yamashita Matataro
shows and tells
Kagemasa Yasaburo about the arrowhead
stained with blood,
washes away the blood
and says it is the arrowhead
that his lord Yoshiie shot
at Abe no Yoritoki.
When the arrowhead strikes Yasaburo's forehead,
the blood from his forehead
mingles with the washed blood,
revealing him as Muneto to his lord,
saying he should be punished by Yoshiie.
Torinomi no Yasaburo, actually Abe no Muneto Matsusuke,
is exposed by Kagemasa and,
moved by Ise no Jiro's loyalty,
leaves Yoshiie's camp.

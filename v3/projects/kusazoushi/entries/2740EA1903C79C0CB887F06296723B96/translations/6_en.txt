When Tori-ten floated what he had in the pond water, it transformed into a theater stage. The mountain became a sand bowl, the reserved seating area, the cheap front seats, and the entrance curtain ties were revealed. The pine wind gave voice like stage actors, and other scenes showed the comings and goings of the intermission. Kouman too found himself in a premium box seat after a long time. "If I had known about this, I should have brought my Orise from home," he thought, though that was rather presumptuous.

Kouman:
"Isn't that person leaning against this side of the pillar from the Matsugane-ya here?"

Tori-ten:
"Those five connected buildings over there appear to be the lord's residence."

From the cheap seats:
"Matsukaze!"

"Hamamura-ya!"

"What a packed house!"

"This one was well written."

"When does the next act start?"

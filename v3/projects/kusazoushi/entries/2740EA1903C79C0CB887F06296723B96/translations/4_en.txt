The arrogant man, upon careful consideration, realized that unless one treats gold and silver—treasured by others—like mere pebbles, one cannot truly be called sophisticated. People who are called boorish or foolish by society all stem from being miserly. There's pleasure in spending money and being called sophisticated, and there's also pleasure in hoarding money through stinginess. If it's all the same, it would seem better to accumulate wealth, so a frugal spirit arose, and he became tight-fisted.

From the age of twenty-seven, he became overly devout and economical, using only a single wick for the oil lamp on the household shrine.

"The master has suddenly started saying nothing but stingy things."

"Keep the fire under the stove to a minimum too. Even if you beg for theater visits, nothing will come of it anyway."

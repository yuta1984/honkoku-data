At that moment, the master of the house,
Jihei, returns
and thinks to strike down that vengeful spirit,
but since it is already something that has died once,
rough handling would be ineffective.
If he strikes violently,
he might tear Kinugawa's (Okane's) obi sash,
which would be pitiful. Also,
if he were to kill
the sash along with her,
that would be
inconvenient,
so he despairs.

【Bottom right, Jihei's dialogue】
"In this situation,
I can only appeal
to Kannon-sama
of all the provinces"

The vengeful spirit too, nearing its end, takes this as the greatest stage of all.
With a sudden change of heart, it endures patiently.
Since Kurikara Fudo has also been around for a long time,
inspired by chestnut shells, it becomes a chestnut burr,
thinking that it would be fitting for
the confrontation at Tanba's Mt. Oeyama.
With such scheming, when it releases
the obi sash it held in its mouth,
the head immediately
transforms into
a chestnut burr.
Nothing is as
unreliable as
dreams.

【Courtesan Kinugawa's dialogue】
"Suke-san, please listen.
That crude man says
he's going to buy out my contract.
He says he's sending
for money from his home province,
so please arrange
the funds beforehand."

【Yonosuke's dialogue】
"When it comes to arranging funds,
I'd like to run away,
but even if I fled,
I'd have to resign myself
to being
a beggar—
that's what it would come to.
Whatever happens,
I must use
all the wisdom
of my lifetime
and try something."

Though Yonosuke lived
with some style,
his true circumstances were of utter poverty. Having no parents
from whom he might receive support after being disowned,
and with no [unclear] means available,
he could only
worry about
Kinugawa's situation.
Setting aside her contract buyout,
since he couldn't even manage
the funds for pawning items,
his heart ached.
He would send letters
and fret,
until finally,
exhausted by his deliberations,
he would only
snore loudly
all the time.

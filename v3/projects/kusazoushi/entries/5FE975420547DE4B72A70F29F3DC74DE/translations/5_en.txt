This one is absolutely irresistible.
I really like her.
Won't you do something for me?
This isn't some Koji-machi well-side
chat, you know.

【Left side man in black haori - dialogue】
Broker, take a look at this.
She's from
recent years.
Haven't you ever seen

Okiku was finally
sold to Yoshiwara for one hundred ryo,
and now under the name
Kinugawa of
the Matsuda house,
she became an unparalleled
courtesan,
with many
customers
seeking her favors.
Around that time,
a great lover named
Yonosuke
found that Kinugawa
was not disagreeable to him,
so they frequently had
overnight encounters
at the back tea house in Fushimi-cho.

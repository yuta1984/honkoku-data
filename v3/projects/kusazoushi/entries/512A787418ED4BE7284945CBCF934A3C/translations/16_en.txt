The sleepyhead teacher lived carelessly in this floating world with a pillow received from a hermit sage. Through this pillow, he could hear people's dream behaviors in his dreams. He realized that "truly, if one's thoughts were reflected in a mirror, how ugly one's appearance would be." The pleasure of lowly people is sleeping comfortably, but this lacks clear meaning. "Good fortune comes to those who wait in bed" - this too is what lazy people say. "Good fortune comes to those who wait while sleeping," said the sleepyhead teacher. "My common name is also Yumesuke (Dream Helper). You young ones should not imitate me. Keep your hearts clean, and if you have time to sleep comfortably, read some picture books instead." Like a venerable teacher, he gathered the children around and spoke to them.

Pillow of Thoughtful Dreams

[Upper section]
Here there was a person called Muchū-an Nebō (Sleepy Hermit of Dream).
Realizing that life is but a dream, he wandered
through the world in a leisurely manner, pretending
to be on a pilgrimage of poetry and
haiku, setting out in grand fashion,
but he was far from being good at poetry.
With a hoarse voice, even his humming was poor, and his haiku
was likewise terrible—carrying only a bag for the five-syllable verses,
he was completely hopeless, an amateur,
but his redeeming quality was a heart
free from attachment.
As usual, traveling through various provinces,
he met what appeared to be a hermit
in the mountains and received
a single box.

Contrary to appearances,
your heart holds
a strong
vow indeed.

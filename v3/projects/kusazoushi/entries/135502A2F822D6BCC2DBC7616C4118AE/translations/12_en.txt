"They say 'where there is sincerity, there is virtue,' and true to the saying, though the noppera-bo ghost thought up a scheme to deceive humans on a whim, this was quite unexpected. Even if this had been fake, I reconsidered that it wouldn't amount to anything. This time the customer-gathering brought in a great deal of money, so I can live comfortably with this. I think I'll come up with some other scheme again next year.

Money truly does increase. Nothing could be more auspicious than this. Pig-sama, please do come to Edo as well. Conveniently, there are few of your kind in Edo now. So I gave the pig generous thanks, served him ear soba, and sent him home with plenty of money on top of that."

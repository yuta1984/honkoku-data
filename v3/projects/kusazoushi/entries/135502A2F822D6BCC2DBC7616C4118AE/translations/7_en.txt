The temple opening (kaicho) is extremely popular, needless to say, and people from near and far provinces are flocking to worship. Among the wonders is a child with disabled legs who comes to Ryogoku Bridge - when he was young, both his legs were paralyzed. Since this temple opening began, those who make wishes with sincere hearts have their hips healed and can stand, so they walk around selling [tales of] these divine benefits.

Now that this temple opening has been such a great success, they are discussing putting on some rare spectacle or theatrical performance. For such entertainment, they plan to purchase a girl from Tamba Province.

Snake: "What I think is that Kawatake [theater?] is gaining momentum, so let's do a joruri puppet theater performance. But since we don't have a partner here, let's quickly go to the Kamigata region to recruit someone."

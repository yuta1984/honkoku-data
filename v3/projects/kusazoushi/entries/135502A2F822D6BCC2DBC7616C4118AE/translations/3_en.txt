The monkey and the great snake considered various Buddhist statues that might be popular for temple exhibitions, but they finally agreed that the monster Jizo of Kirishima would be best. They went to the cat temple and made various recommendations. Since the Three-Colored Monk also saw profit in this venture, he immediately agreed and said, "Go quickly to Kamakura and make the request."

Setting out toward their destination, they traveled gradually until they reached the Rokugō ferry crossing. The snow from the mountains had melted, making the water flow swift, with no way to cross. The snake said he could swim across, but the monkey knew nothing about water from the start and was wondering what to do, when the master of this river, a soft-shell turtle, appeared and said, "I'll ferry you across." The two were overjoyed and rode on the turtle to cross.

♪If you fall off the turtle, the monkey won't get eaten
♪Don't worry about it, I'll ferry you back on the return trip too

"What good fortune to meet you here. Thanks to you, we were able to cross. However, somehow the snake is being troublesome."

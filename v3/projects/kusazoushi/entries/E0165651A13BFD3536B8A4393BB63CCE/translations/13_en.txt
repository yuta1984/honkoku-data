The brothers were summoned before the local lord, who inquired in detail about the entire course of their revenge through his senior retainers. He declared that easily defeating supernatural beings who had acquired mystical powers was an unprecedented act of vengeance in all history.

He granted each of them a new stipend of five hundred koku of rice and took them into his service. In accordance with his wishes, they immediately received a mansion, took in their parents, showed extraordinary filial piety, and prospered for a long time. A joyful tale of spring.

The brothers are summoned.

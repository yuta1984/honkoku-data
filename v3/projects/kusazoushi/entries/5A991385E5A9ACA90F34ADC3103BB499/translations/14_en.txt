The wrapping paper of Hyuga hansetsu says:

"Well, I was used at a textile shop in the center of Edo, and oh my, I get completely flustered with customer service all day long. Even when waiting to be used, both buyers and sellers get fed up saying it takes too long. Well, they just make clicking sounds with the abacus, saying 'Alright, finally, is this acceptable now?' Then they pick me up to write something, scribbling frantically like writing a bearded daimoku, so illegibly that you can't read a single character from the outside. When they finally finish their scrawled writing and someone calls out 'Half-price!', along with the money..."

[Middle right section conversation]
"I am most grateful"

[Lower right section conversation]
"Madam, this obi would suit you perfectly. This is definitely fashionable right now"
"This is already for you, madam - new style with white binding, and the match is excellent"

[Continuation of upper right section]
"...thrown into a box like luggage and taken to the back. Then what takes even longer - about an hour - is when they use the remaining paper to write a letter to their familiar call-girl teahouse. But since they write with the same crude hand that scrawled that bearded daimoku, trying to write refined language in an vulgar way, nothing comes out properly. So they tear it up and crumple it, write again and tear it up, and that's how I, the torn and discarded one, came to be here."

"Show the Hiwatcha crest, the crepe silk"

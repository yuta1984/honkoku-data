The nose paper (tissue) from Ueda speaks:

"I was placed together with straw sandals and rope sandals, but a maid from a certain mansion came on her day off to go to the theater, and bought me for just one chō and eight mon. The next day we went to the cheap seats at the theater, and thinking 'this cost only eight mon,' she first wiped around her pitch-black collar, then used me as a plate for her lunch box's simmered vegetables and fried rice, and finally, at the gate, after eating discarded oranges, she wiped her hands on me."

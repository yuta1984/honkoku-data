The tattered old promissory note says:

"I too can be written on when relatives come, and can have good money certificates written on me. If it's just one document, I would be treated with care, but after having a promissory note for fifty ryo and one bu written on me, and moreover in these times when promissory notes are useless, I was treated roughly and thrown into a waste paper basket for miscellaneous scraps. It appeared that they had probably collected three times the principal in interest alone.

The glue-soaked decorative paper scrap says:

"I too look truly pathetic, but in recent years I've become cheap. If only I could at least be bought in Shinjuku, but listen to this. I was bought somewhere and used frantically by a courtesan whose hair was disheveled, scribbling the most outrageous improprieties, and even at the end, when the brush was worn down, with lipstick and other things stuck to disgusting places. And with hands like bent nails, writing things like 'please continue your patronage the day after tomorrow' and 'the day after tomorrow on the fifth,' such was the state. You can imagine the quality of the writing from this. I was completely appalled.

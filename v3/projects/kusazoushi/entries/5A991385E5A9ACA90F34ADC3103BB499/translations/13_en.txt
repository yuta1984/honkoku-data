The scrap of Mino paper says:

"At the end of the year, I was bought by the chō to a mansion, where some samurai clumsily pieced me together for replacing shoji screens and lantern paper. That fellow, instead of acknowledging his poor workmanship, shifts the blame to the warped shoji and curses, 'Damn it, this paper is too narrow for everything!' How detestable.

Even in haikai poetry contests, there's a verse:
'Pasted all around the four sides of the lantern'

Such verses exist, but what a truly hopeless, clumsy fellow."

"This is terribly warped paper!"
"The small knife is fundamentally dull - how irritating!"

The scraps of Yoshino paper say:

"Aside from being ground with lacquer to make October cherry blossoms, I have little use in life. Due to karma, I was bought by a Buddhist temple, where the treasurer monks, chattering idly while sitting cross-legged, cut me up carelessly. Then, to make flowers to offer to the founding master, without even washing their hands after urinating, they finally finish and yawn greatly, saying 'Damn, finally done,' then kick the scraps around with their feet. What a waste! They act as if they're making lanterns or decorations for night festivals."

[Lower left section conversation]
"How ridiculous - it stinks terribly. Enough, let's clean this up."
"Make it a bit softer and be done with it."

The recycled hansetsu paper says:

"Well, I have become tremendously exhausted, being roughly scribbled on carelessly all day long. No matter how much I am just paper, if I had gone elsewhere, I wouldn't have been used so roughly. At the end of it all, when I wondered what would be written on me, someone wrote down various items, and concluded with: 'Clearance items, monthly contract expired, therefore we are flowing goods without regard to circumstances, [signed] Someone' - and sent it off to a pawn shop without even writing a proper name."

[Continuation of upper right section]
"That's all they wrote before sending me off. When they read it at the destination, they made a bitter face and said 'This is troublesome - no profit increase possible, no business to be had. Do as you please!' While saying this, they tore me up, chewed me, and threw me away."

"Two bu of payment"

"This seems wrong. Let's try once more."

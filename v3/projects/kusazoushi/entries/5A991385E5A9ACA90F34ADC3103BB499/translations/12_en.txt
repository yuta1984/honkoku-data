The bag made from fabric scraps says:

"I'm never used for anything particularly good, but among my uses, I ended up in the hands of a mountain monk who claimed to be a religious devotee and was made into a Buddha statue collection bag. In the old days, Buddha statue bags held two or three go of rice at a time, but now they hold five go or more at a time. This monk would buy two or three sweet potatoes with five or eight mon, sweet-talk elderly women in the tenements, and give them to their grandchildren as gifts. When the grandmothers and the deities they worship are pleased by such kindness to their beloved children and grandchildren, that cunning fellow takes advantage of their joy and requests, 'We're building a Jizo statue, so please spread the word and contribute.' And then:

'Yes, we'll gladly participate in this busy undertaking.'

'Ah, it's gotten a bit less.'
'Well then, grandmother, exit through this window.'

[Continuation of the upper right section]
Without any real effort, he makes cheap Buddha statues, makes some excuse about taking leave, opens my mouth and stuffs me with completely black rice, hangs me on a stand to make it look like donations came from elsewhere. He carries a banner and deceives local shrine devotees and elderly women, dragging them around all over Edo. In the end, nobody knows where the Buddha statue went, he sold off all the collected rice, the monk disappeared to who knows where, and I was left behind on an empty shelf."

'Building Jizo Bodhisattva, shall we contribute? Look, look at that lord/deity!'

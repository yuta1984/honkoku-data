Great Ancient Times: Chinese Monsters - Complete Three Volumes

I viewed Takarai Kikaku's self-inscribed painting of Shōki (the demon queller), which contained the hokku verse:
　　"Now here we have Danjūrō - demons, begone!"

Shōki possesses the art of exorcising plague demons. The actor Danjūrō's fame is so great that it is known even in foreign lands. He particularly excels at heroic and courageous performances, making an art of scenes depicting the defeat of vengeful enemies. Since this closely resembles Shōki's banishment of evil spirits, Kikaku praised this with his witty and spontaneous creative insight. Moved by these things, I have made them the theme of this illustrated book.

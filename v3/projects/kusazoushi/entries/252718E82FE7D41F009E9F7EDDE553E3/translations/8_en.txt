One time, Shaka decided to go alone to play in the pleasure quarters during the snow season. He boarded a boat at Yanagibashi. Just then, heavy snow began to fall, so saying "My being cold would shame others," he forcibly lent his haori coat to the boatman and rowed the boat himself, shivering in just his undergarment (juban). This was truly refined behavior.

The boatman, overwhelmed with gratitude, sang:
♪Master Shaka pushes the oar of this small boat, going through the snow with the tide, this too is your kindness, I did nothing but... and we quickly arrived at Yoshiwara.

"Ah, can I hear the song of Takasago? I didn't know. Indeed, the place we've arrived at is worth a thousand gold pieces. While I lie here, you do the rowing" - this is what the true Shaka-sama would say.

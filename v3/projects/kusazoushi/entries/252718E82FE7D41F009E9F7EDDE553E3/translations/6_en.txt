【Right Upper Section】
In the Sanya area, a local thug named Daima no Hachi was involved in some quarrel and came to the embankment with two or three others to beat up his opponent. Shaka(jūrō), without any particular purpose, was just passing by on his way back from Asakusa when he was mistaken for someone else and beaten severely. However, since Shaka has cultivated the spirit of a connoisseur, he doesn't mind at all and endures the pain.

"Gentlemen, you surely want to beat someone up. Please hit me as much as you like. But your hands must hurt."

"Hey boss, if he's so agreeable about it, there's no satisfaction in beating him."

【Right Lower Section】
"When I'm with Daima no Hachi-sama, I'm quite a menacing and spirited fellow too."

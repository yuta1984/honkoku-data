[Continued] "You too have become entangled with that impoverished ronin of the Soga, saying you don't want other customers. Come now, say that you've given up on Suketsune!" She beats her severely. Kamegiku raises her face and says, "Even though I'm just a lodger, I am Yoshimori's daughter Minazuki-kimi. I work as a courtesan only because I want to meet Suketsune-san. How could I give him up?" She collapses weeping.

Though Suketsune feels pity, the timing is bad and he cannot emerge. He presses his fan to his face and hides in the shadow of a pine tree. Day quickly turns to evening with a pale moonlight. The proprietress, unaware of his presence, says, "Listen, samurai, though it seems cruel, this woman has gone mad over that good-for-nothing Juro, so I'm disciplining her. Come now, give up on that impoverished ronin Suketsune!" She beats her severely again, saying "Leaving her tied up like this is also a lesson," binds her to a pine tree, and the proprietress goes home.

The brothers joyfully run over and untie the binding ropes. "Suketsune-sama?" she clings to them, unable to speak through her tears. Juro too is overcome with tears. "I knew it was you from earlier, but the cruelty was so extreme I couldn't emerge and held back. Are you hurt?" Both Juro and Goro comfort her when the page-servant comes running: "Listen, listen! That Tora is a beast! She's being ransomed by our very enemy Suketsune and permits it!" Hearing this, Tokimune flies into a rage: "Damn her! I'll tear off Tora's head!" As he dashes out, Juro restrains him: "Come now, dealing with such a beast is undignified. If you get entangled in needless anger, even the memorial service will weigh on your mind, and when we face our enemy, lingering attachments might emerge. If we cut ties cleanly now, nothing will trouble our hearts, and for us this is unexpected good fortune. Leave her be." Saying this, he looks sharply ahead: "That lantern's crest is certainly that of Wada no Yoshimori. Before we're noticed, quickly, quickly!" The two brothers drive away the two women.

○Previously from Cho's separate house, this place is during the Bon festival. Using names like Minazuki (sixth month), ice house, and purification suggests the original was a summer play. The name Nokaze (wild wind) is appropriate as Tora's sister.

○Minazuki-hime Kamegiku is an artistic name. She suffers punishment from the proprietress.

Great Era Chinese Monsters - Three volumes complete

When I viewed Takarai Kikaku's self-painted praise of Zhong Kui,
　　Now here, Danjūrō! "Demons, begone!"
was the hokku verse. Indeed, Zhong Kui possesses the art of expelling plague demons. The actor
Danjūrō's fame is so great that it is known even in foreign lands. Particularly in performing
heroic warriors, he excels in skill, making it his art to portray the defeat of vengeful enemies.
Since this closely resembles Zhong Kui's expelling of evil spirits,
Kikaku's witty and
exquisite creative intent in praising this moved me in various ways, and I made it the theme of this illustrated book.

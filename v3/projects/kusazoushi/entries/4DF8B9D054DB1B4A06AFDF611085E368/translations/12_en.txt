"How ridiculous! Was what just appeared the spirit of a rice weevil? Well, as I turn around wondering what I've conjured up, there will likely be apparitions of sake, fish, and miso-wrapped things. Just as I'm thinking what might appear next, I hear a loud voice calling 'Bonito! Bonito!' and a fish seller comes flying through, wearing only a headband and an apron from Mekurashima, saying 'Excuse me, sir, the first bonito of the season has arrived!'

How absurd! This would make your heart skip a beat. Even soba sellers don't come out in weather like this. These supernatural creatures that have gathered should wash their feet and retreat, and at a time when even snow women are melting in their kotatsu, a first bonito seller appears!"

"That's what makes this supernatural phenomenon so novel indeed. Certainly, when you'd expect to say 'point-blank like a gun,' instead we have first bonito in the snowfall. The concept isn't entirely new, but isn't this salted bonito at year's end?" he says. The seller replies, "I'm not some grimy, stained mackerel seller dealing in salted goods. Even supernatural beings, when they go out shopping in high spirits and the first bonito arrives, all the street vendors collapse in a heap, causing fights and commotion - trampling flounder, making sea bream's eyes pop out in the great uproar. It was just like having a gathering in the Dragon Palace. So I snatched this away without any trouble, intending to sell it to you," and opens the carrying case to show - indeed, it's a fine Eastern maiden's bonito.

"I don't mind about the price, but it must be quite expensive," he says. Then wings sprout from the bonito and it flies away calling "Twhoo, twhoo!" "How clever, what a witty supernatural creature!" he remarks. The fish seller responds, "This is a supernatural being from beyond Hakone Pass," makes this joke, and vanishes.

At Setsubun
already
the spring wind blows

"Fortune in,
demons out" - even to
the fragrant
plum blossoms    Anonymous

Now here
Danjūrō and
"Demons out!"
　　　Kikaku

Looking upon him, he appears stern
Like a great general
defending a fortress,
yet when one approaches
there is nothing to fear,
like the costume and cap
of the actor Yumeng

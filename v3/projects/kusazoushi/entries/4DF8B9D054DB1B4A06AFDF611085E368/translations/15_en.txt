After a while, various rattling sounds are heard, and supernatural creatures come running out like blowgun darts. A pestle sprouts wings and flies out, a mortar grows legs and rolls out, Otafuku runs carrying a lantern, and a masseur flees carrying matsutake mushrooms. When a cutting board develops eyes and nose to become wooden clogs, a dustpan grows eyes and transforms into a wasabi grater. With all this commotion, even the tatami mats lift up. What a great uproar this is!

Thinking it might be supernatural soot-sweepers, a figure resembling Kajiwara (Kagetoki) crawls out from under the veranda. When someone calls him "this lowly fellow," he responds "Since I'm cleaning soot, even the discipline insects flee from me" and disappears.

The interior of the firewood shed becomes noisy again. Wondering what's happening, they peer in to see the appearance of the forty-seven retainers' night attack. Since it's a firewood shed with pickled radish, someone contrives to say the enemy is Kudō Saemon - what a strange encounter this is! The transformations have become so complex - Kudō Saemon in Chūshingura as the tenth and final act? Are the supernatural creatures finished now?

The supernatural beings discuss among themselves: "With the theme of 'New Year's Eve fears,' let's bring out supernatural creatures of rice, sake, side dishes, miso, firewood and such, and bewitch them with the revenge stories of the Soga brothers and Chūshingura." But having thought this, they realize they cannot prevail against the two characters meaning "loyalty and filial piety." Yura-no-suke, the lord of the Soga brothers, becomes a demon-repelling force, emerges from the hanging scroll painting of Shōki, reveals the appearance of Ichikawa Danjūrō in costume, and wielding a great sword for subduing demons, declares "I shall show you a spectacle!" Then, like striking demon-repelling beans, he sweeps them away with a rustling sound.

To be continued.

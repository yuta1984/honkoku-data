At that moment, someone comes trampling through the snow. Dressed in white ceremonial robes with padded cotton, holding a Chinese umbrella - this appears to be the costume of a heron maiden.

"Has a heron transformed? For a snow woman, the color seems a bit too black," he mocks with a sneer. She responds haughtily: "How dare you call this white ceremonial robe black! In the northern provinces where heavy snows fall, there are no birds blacker than herons - how can you call white things black? These white robes with snowy collar and sleeves should be rewashed and stretched."

"Why is that?" "Well, because they're old. From late at night, trampling like loaches, without even singing - what kind of heron maiden is this? Such a creature isn't even worthy of performing mandarin duck dance pieces."

"No, no, I am a maiden in pure white, the whitest ceremonial garments." "Ah, for pure white, the color is rather black - perhaps there isn't enough moonlight." "Whether black or white, please take it in your hands and see." "No matter how I look, it's black ceremonial dress. If you're a heron maiden, wash off the collar grime from those old clothes with rice bran and transform properly. To call the white feathers of premium rice black is pitiful."

"No, you're a twisted, dirty girl. If it's old rice, use clear water for rice gruel, and scrub until the rice bran bag tears apart." "Oh, how embarrassing - this black color is my true nature."

"Ah, so that's it - what a failed transformation of a heron maiden." "Yes, I'm a crow maiden," she says, and "pressed by the snow," she vanishes.

《Soga plays of the Genroku era》 Soga Tayū-zome by Chikamatsu Monzaemon

○ Chikamatsu Monzaemon was originally a kabuki playwright. I borrowed from a friend an old script from that time called "Soga Tayū-zome," and when I read it aloud by lamplight, I felt as if I were watching a play from over a hundred years ago right before my eyes. Finding it extremely fascinating, I wanted to transmit this ancient style to the world, so without changing the original plot in the slightest, I only modernized the language and kept the title as "Soga Mukashi Kyōgen" (Ancient Soga Play).

○ Although the original manuscript bears no date, there are reasons within the text to believe it dates to around Genroku 6-7 (1693-1694). The explanation would be lengthy, so I omit it here.

○ The reason the play is called "Tayū-zome" is, I believe, that the tayū refers to Mizuki Tatsunosuke. At that time, the dyed silk he habitually wore was called "Tatsunosuke-zome" and was very fashionable, so the play was likely named after this.

【Song】The old Yatate no Sugi (Arrow-stand Cedar)
Birds are singing vigorously
Let us rely on its future

○Oni-ō Dōza nocked an arrow to his bow and shot it swiftly into the treetop of the cedar, saying:
"How about that, Dōsai? In ancient times, this cedar was called Yumoto no Sugi (Bow-base Cedar), but ever since Prince Rokuson-ō Tsunemoto shot his uwazashi arrow here while praying for victory over imperial enemies, it has been customarily called Yatate no Sugi (Arrow-stand Cedar). Those with wishes in their hearts use arrows to divine with this tree. Now, as you can see, my arrow has hit the first branch."
"My arrow stands true in the second branch without missing its target - this is an auspicious sign that I shall defeat my intended enemy."
"How wonderful!" As they prostrated themselves in prayer, two young women appeared, shyly holding fans before their faces:
"Truly, if we speak of faces and figures, it's as if flowers speak and autumn leaves laugh. Our mother's sake is excellent - save us, Amida Buddha! We greatly desire to receive love's seal through nejaka's divine blessing."

Zenjibō's pain comes from being Sukenari's only son.

Oni-ō is a wakashū (young man/youth). There are also names like Kin-ō and Kiku-ō, so making Oni-ō a wakashū seems to have good reason. In the original text, the wig is depicted like this. 【Illustration of Oni-ō's wig】

Such words of praise seem to be the fashion of this time. They remain in Chōsaku's jōruri today.

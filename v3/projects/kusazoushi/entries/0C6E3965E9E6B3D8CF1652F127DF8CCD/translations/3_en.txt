The noble couple's relationship was harmonious, and every night until past the ninth hour (around midnight), they would engage in amusing activities with their fingernails, with lady attendants serving as companions for their drinking parties. Some servants would mistakenly come saying "I'm going to look for lodging," while others would say "I'm going to Yoshiwara," and every night there would be disputes over such matters. They took pleasure in watching the servants fall silent after being scolded by the head lady-in-waiting.

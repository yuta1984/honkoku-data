Godaisan Ushi no Toki Moude (Proxy Pilgrimage at the Hour of the Ox) 《Marginal note: Okumura》

In a place called Kamegayatsu in Kamakura, there lives a man named Matsuyama Kageyu 【the master's name also appears in frame 7】. Having diligently devoted himself to promoting Buddhism, his wish for retirement was granted, and he passed on his family headship to Shin no Jō, his only daughter's beloved. Overjoyed beyond measure, he was living peacefully when fresh fish from Shichirigahama came flopping about, so he drinks sake and enjoys himself.

【Dialogue】
"Tomorrow, the young master will depart for the capital."

From the time of divided hair at Tsutsui-zutsu, they had been lovers' conversations, and since he continued visiting the village of Takayasu in Kawachi Province, the woman of that time should have resented this, but she composed the poem: "When the wind blows, white waves rise on the offing - are you traveling alone through weak Tatsuta Mountain?" So he stopped his visits to Kawachi. [Ise Monogatari, Chapter 23, Tsutsui-zutsu]

Similarly, when he earnestly relied on Takigawa, Takigawa turned around and in great haste stopped the visits. Takigawa's heart was also moved, and he arranged for her redemption to the mansion. Because Takai's heart was sincere, the Matsuyama family prospered for a long time, which was truly auspicious.

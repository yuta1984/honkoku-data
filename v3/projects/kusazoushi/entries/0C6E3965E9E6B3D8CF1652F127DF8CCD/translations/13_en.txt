Shin'nosuke came as usual, and when he met Takigawa, she was huffing and puffing in a way he had never seen before. Thinking there was something he couldn't understand or make sense of, he assumed it was lovers' quarrel talk requiring an apology, but no matter what he said, she only responded coldly. Even when he asked if she might be planning to go home or somewhere else, she gave no greeting at all, became irritated, and like a Bungo-bushi performance, he acted boldly thinking he would apologize later. But since she wouldn't even grunt in response, it seemed that she had another good customer and was giving him the cold shoulder. He never dreamed this was the case. "What a damn beast!" he thought angrily and left.

[Dialogue]
"You contemptible beast!"

Chuji came running in surprise.

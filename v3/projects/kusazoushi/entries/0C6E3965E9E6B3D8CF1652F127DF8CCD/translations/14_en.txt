Shin'nosuke was angry at Takigawa's place, but since she didn't even try to stop him and let him leave, he realized he had been deceived in various ways while continuing to visit her. With no face to show his household members, he said angrily, "You are infuriating! I have no desire to see you even once more!" He completely stopped his visits and shut himself up at home, thinking it was regrettable to waste his thoughts on such trivial matters when he could be enjoying interesting pursuits like composing seasonal haiku or playing hundred-verse point-scoring games.

[Dialogue]
"Whether you call them geisha or courtesans, they're all the same"

"If you say geisha, does that become a riddle?"

"The messenger has returned"

Nissaka

From Shimada, rolling a two to reach Kanaya-Nissaka. The specialty is bracken-root mochi. A woman wearing a furisode is making mochi. Most reasonably, there's also one customer, nowadays.

Even in Nissaka, there isn't a single unfashionable girl who would wear a cotton furisode. This was also troublesome, but since old-timers firmly remember such things, they rely on a sixty or seventy-year-old grandmother, dress her in a furisode, and bring her along to make do.

This is somewhat ungrateful, but my stomach is lonely indeed.

A substitute for the furisode - an old woman's furisode. If the lord is satisfied, that's fine.

Even though I may be an old woman, you shouldn't make such contrived bad puns.

Rolling a six at Nissaka, since the lover got the opposite of one, the retainer's luck is strong, leaping in one bound through Kakegawa, Fukuroi, Mitsuke, Hamamatsu, Maisaka, all the way to Arai. Since such good luck as never before has appeared, they should lift the front and inspect. The young retainer assigned to this duty is handsome, well-featured, and clearly intelligent, so there's no trouble. First, he confidently lifts and rolls up, acting dignified. The lord also seems pleased with this and personally conducts the inspection.

Well, well, the young retainer is splendid, splendid. What a reliable retainer overall. Are there any hidden items? Let us inspect.

Should that person quietly show just the bell? It is like this.

The preparations were made this morning.

Rolling a two from Kuwana, passing through Yokkaichi to Ishiyakushi. This time it's a place where messengers run naked. They made those who seemed fleet-footed into messengers and had them run briefly around the inn town as fire watchmen, but perhaps the lord found it not very interesting, so he said to make it a big event and turn it into tobacco, and it quickly came to an end. Well, the messengers running without any destination are strange things indeed. This is already the fiftieth time going back and forth.

This time a two comes up, leading to Shono and Kameyama. Here is a place where one wears paper rain capes when it rains. The weather is quite good, but according to the rules, one must wear a rain cape. No matter how smelly it might be, such tedious things are already depressing, but wearing a paper rain cape makes the depression twice as bad.

No matter how much we complain, wearing paper rain capes in this weather is strange. Oh, how it reeks of oil!

Just as Lusheng saw fifty years of glory and prosperity in an instant in his dream of Handan, this viewing of the entire Tokaido fifty-three stations journey in one night's first dream of two days is quite reasonable. Though it may seem like a lie that placing the road sugoroku game under the pillow in exchange for a treasure ship caused this, both the real things and the genuine things are true. The immediate genuine blue is the real thing - this beloved first dream of Lord Banosuke in the year of the horse is truly auspicious and entertaining.

Though Zenko said the dream was long and that's fine, somehow it still cannot be helped.

So it was all a dream after all! Ha, how foolish it seems.

Since he has just awakened, Lord Banosuke beats the drum in celebration. However, this cannot be seen as it is under his clothing.

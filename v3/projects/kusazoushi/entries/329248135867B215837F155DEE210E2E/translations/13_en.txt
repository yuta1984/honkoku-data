Otsu

【Main Text】
When a six comes up here, the path opens up greatly all at once. From what I hear, the betting stakes were also high when sixes came up. However, with a six appearing around the good spots, one hits Seki, Sakanoshita, Minakuchi, Ishibe, Kusatsu, and Otsu in succession. Here in this sugoroku game, in Kusatsu's inn quarter, on top of a three-story roof, only a sign reading "Otsu" is written horizontally. There's nothing to do.

There's nothing particularly troublesome along the journey. If one had landed on such spots until now, one wouldn't have struggled like this - that's quite reasonable and natural. If the reverse of six - a one - had come up here, one would go straight up to Kyoto, and though the Ichi River flows strongly, that's not what happened. Instead, an extended six came up, and returning to the shrine with five or more is quite unexpected - oh my, how unforeseen!

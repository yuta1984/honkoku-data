Shrine

【Main Text】
Having exceeded by five and returned to the shrine, the lord tried to maintain his dignity saying that one cannot skip even one ri of the seven-ri crossing, but perhaps due to about four measures of fatigue, his expression doesn't look very pleased. His retainers are also bewildered, unable to speak, and continue the journey in silence.

Kusatsu

【Main Text】
Being somewhat dazed and weary, finally arriving back at Otsu and thinking "this isn't how it was supposed to be," wanting to go up to Kyoto, he became emotional and was about to cry when he rolled a three. With two remaining, he returns to Kusatsu. No matter how much the lord might scheme, he completely surrenders to this and can't help it. For the first time, he slightly realizes that it would have been better to have stopped this journey altogether.

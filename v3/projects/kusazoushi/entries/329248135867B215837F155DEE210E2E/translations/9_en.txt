Mariko

【Main Text】
The lord is particularly poor at throwing dice. Having thrown the dice at Fuchu, he immediately moves to neighboring Mariko. The sugoroku shows Utsunotani's ten-dumpling seller, with one woman depicted and one person. This is an expensive specialty of the journey, to be made exactly the same way, by the lord's wish.

Utsunotani Ten Dumplings

Do you call it only women, or do you call it people's appearance? This should please your lordship.

Buy some, buy some!

Even young women use sugoroku-like calls.

Yes, yes, there shouldn't be such pushy behavior either.

Shimada

【Main Text】
Since the lord is poor at throwing dice, this time the retainer throws, and from Mariko he rolls a three to reach Shimada-Kanaya. The sugoroku shows a two-day stay due to flooding. Even though there's no flood, it's a two-day stay. The retainer has rolled to an unexpected place.

As the story goes, the daughter of the inn at Shimada-Kanaya, when serving namasu, sings an old poem about red-skinned things. Whether it's that or not, even with red things, they should quarrel one by one, and with one shot at the young men, combining both into one, the lord speaks words of simplification.

Ah, how amusing! It's material for stories about palanquin sightseeing. Retainers, how is this wordplay? What do you think - he speaks as if buying fresh sauda fish.

【Illustration dialogue】
It's neither amusing nor anything, so my lady, it's like fresh sauda.

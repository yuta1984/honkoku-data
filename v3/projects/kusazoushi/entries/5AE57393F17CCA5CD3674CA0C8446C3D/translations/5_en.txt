Thunder came to Wind God's side to discuss money-making schemes.
"Neither you nor I need to do anything particularly strenuous. If we make it rain and blow wind on demand, we can grab money however we like. Even though we can't always blow when we want or act selfishly, in exchange, as long as we have plenty of that stuff (money), we can muster the spirit to handle any anger that arises. So I'm planning to set up a shop in a lively place."
This was quite amusing to hear.
"What, I agree," Wind God said, understanding. "Fair weather is more convenient, so as long as the weather is good, we can run it like a tea shop without much worry, can't we?" At this strange turn, he realized this was the perfect opportunity.

[Dialogue]
"Even if we open a shop, frequently checking on it wouldn't be proper."
"What I dealt with - was it a person? No, it was light (trivial)."

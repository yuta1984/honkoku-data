Though people hastily call them "demons" or "evil spirits," it's really not like that at all. As the Yamato poetry says, there's a reliable example in the saying "spirits who are deeply moved have no evil ways" - they look down from above at young Umewaka's suffering with pity, and for how many years now, still on March 15th, they shed tears of rain with bamboo hats, their appearance like tigers weeping in sympathy, never forgetting - this shows they are extremely kind-hearted and compassionate beings.

In recent years, the way the "substitute tears" fall as rain appears mocking on the surface, but while they might seem like simple good-natured folk, they also show shrewd and calculating aspects.

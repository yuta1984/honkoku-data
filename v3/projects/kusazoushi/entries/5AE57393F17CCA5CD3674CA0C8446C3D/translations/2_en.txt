The scenery of the main street in Tenjiku (India)

The merchants' shops are lined up just like in Japan, with nothing different in the arrangement or local customs. What we don't have here are things like loincloths made of tiger skin, but instead we lack umbrellas and wooden clogs. Since this is Tenjiku, somehow it never rains. Even those who have traveled around Yamato (Japan) and act knowledgeable, boasting about their ancestry, find that in distant Tenjiku there is nowhere they haven't seen.

Famous places and historical sites serve as diversions from boredom, but they are troubled by the fact that brothels and theaters have roofs. When there are festivals, children are delighted, and even when there are fights, there's no cause for concern. Even in today's world, there are overly rational people who mistakenly think that rain is the urine of demons. But with all the shrines, temples, and distinguished personages present, if one were to do such irreverent things, divine punishment would immediately strike. Thinking "what good would come of such behavior," people are quite cautious.

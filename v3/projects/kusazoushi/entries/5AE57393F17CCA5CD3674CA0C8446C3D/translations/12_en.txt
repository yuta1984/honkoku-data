The North Star heard that the two gods of thunder and wind were making great profits, so one of the gods from among the stars of the Big Dipper came to punish them and visited the thunder and wind gods.

"Now, now, you two are utterly outrageous and hopeless. Until now, you've been selfish - when you want to rain, you rain endlessly until people get fed up, and when you decide to be lazy, you create excessive drought. When people say 'how convenient' about your profitable schemes, it reflects badly on us as well.

The winds on designated days and all-day rains are predetermined - that is your duty. If you would just ensure the successful harvest of the five grains, that would be an easy job with no equals.

Especially since gold and silver are treasures of the nation, even if you hoard them for yourselves and wrestle wearing tiger-skin loincloths, you'll never achieve the fame of sumo champions like Onogawa and Tanikaze.

Stop your greed and return what you've profited to where it belongs.

The sun, being placed at the very top of heaven, has no clouds or haze at all. If you make just one hole and extract oil..."

The thunder and wind gods had nothing to say, and apologized, saying "Indeed, though there is no shortage in the wind and rain of heaven, this was truly foolish greed on our part."

【Star's dialogue】
"You two wouldn't want to be sent down to the earthly realm, would you?"

【Thunder and Wind Gods' dialogue】
"Yes, yes, yes, exactly as you say. Yes, yes, yes."

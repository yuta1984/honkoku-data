In prosperous areas,
orders from
the countryside are
particularly abundant. During the busy season
of planting crops in fields
and paddies, for favorable weather
for ships departing
and entering port,
requests for wind -
from everything
to anything,
without missing
or refusing any,
we accept all orders.
The money we
earn handsomely
makes people
happy with us,
and there's no limit to it.

Though there are many businesses,
there's no other fine business
that cannot be counterfeited or imitated
like this one. Making handsome profits
while boasting about it
makes us the envy of others.
The monkey of Kamakura (weather deity),
for a great lord's long-standing
entertainment, on the 11th day
when he goes on a pleasure boat trip,
requesting that
the weather be fine all day -
we certainly
accept such orders.
On the 11th day, we control
the moisture in metalwork,
and though we speak of "dividing the horse's back,"
we have our own methods
for this, so there's no need
for any concern at all. Please enjoy
watching fireworks and
return home leisurely.
We'll make it rain over there,
so as long as there are no evening showers here,
there's no need for later precautions.

【Customer's dialogue】
In addition,
please also take care of
the field crops

【Demon's dialogue】
Seven and a half tan
means
the village
is close
I suppose

【Customer's dialogue】
Indeed,
the heat of the mansion
is also quite
bothersome

【Demon's dialogue】
If the wind
is just
a little,
it probably
won't matter

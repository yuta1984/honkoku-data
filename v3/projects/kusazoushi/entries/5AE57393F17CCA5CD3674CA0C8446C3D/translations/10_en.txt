In bustling places
close to the countryside,
during periods when
it doesn't rain,
they pay no attention,
but during the busy
spring season, within the castle grounds
even for New Year greetings,
when they finish and push forward,
wanting profits,
they put out
two or three hundred [coins]
from their funds.
Everyone competes
to place orders. In Tenjiku (India), quick work
and skillful money-making -
even demons who possess [wealth] find sweet potato roasting
generally not
a bothersome
matter,
because it benefits
both sides.

Depending on
your generous
heart and intentions,
though we can give discounts,
because it's such
tremendous [business],
we're quite
busy with orders.
Nevertheless,
unless we even open
the mouth of
the money bag,
there are no customers.
We do whatever
we like and
make profits
as we want
to make them.

Everyone knows there are wind spirits in heaven. Particularly Thunder, who has a beautiful wife called Lightning, is quite renowned. Moreover, since he goes around with a big belly, when he goes out to play with his numerous hangers-on, he has them carry hand-dance drums. This is why people call them "drum-bearers" (flatterers). Because they walk together with Thunder-sama and joke around, they sometimes misstep and fall. Thunder-sama doesn't fall. The beasts that walk together with him and fall - that's what those fellows are.

Among them, there's a talentless actor who started the currently popular small pattern called saya-gata, who is particularly favored. So he devised a money-making scheme and came to discuss it. Though there was no shortage of anything, the dislike of money-making doesn't exist even in Tianzhu (India). If there's something that seems more dangerous but profitable than usual, he would even consult with Wind God about it. "Let's try it once," he said, and to celebrate, he started with soba-kiri, seaweed dengaku, and miso clear soup.

[Dialogue]
"Since ancient times, there has been no entertainment in this world called 'roofing,' so after having a drink, let's play mekuri (card game)."

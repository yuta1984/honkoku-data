The two of them
both
intoxicated
by tea,
feeling
at ease,
thinking that
drinking only
at home
is not
interesting,
laughing and saying
"Let's have
a drink,"
suddenly
becoming sensible,
the two companions
set out for
Nakanomachi.

What people
call tea-
drinking
companions
are typically
dignified
mature
old gentlemen
befitting
retirees,
but these tea-
drinking companions
are completely different—
quite unlike
their usual
disposition.
With a foundation
already laid, they drink more and more,
both intoxicated parties
reveling together.

Seibei calls out,
"Hey,
come on!"

"Hurry up
and come!"

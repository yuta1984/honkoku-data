Having been permitted to return to Kanto,
he would go back to his hometown.
Due to the retired man's kind
heart, while informing him,
he came to bid farewell.
Both of them
rejoiced.
Though many people
make mistakes with sake,
this was the peak
of their happiness.
Though the two made mistakes
even with tea,
since it was a joyous occasion,
they intended to drink
to their heart's content for the celebration.
The retired man, despite his advanced age,
carrying the burden on his back,
with his cousin
named after the hand-dance,
Seibei laughingly
and auspiciously
returned to his
home country.

[Right margin]
There is much
regret at parting

His mother must be waiting
impatiently

Seibei's fortune-telling
became unexpectedly
fashionable,
and while he was making a living this way, his cousin
came to visit
after a long time
and was invited for tea.

From that time
onward,
to the Yakushi-sama and
the Tea Tree
Inari shrine, he offered tea
as an offering
and became
well-behaved.
Regarding his parent's
matter,
from the bookshelf
the usual
arrangement.

Seibei's
father's
side
because of physiognomy
felt
sorry

"For fifty me or
one hundred me, I want
to take responsibility
and apologize
for him.
Since I am also
acquainted with them,
I'd like to send
a letter,
but my face
hasn't changed
and it's embarrassing.
First, for pocket money,"
he received ten ryo. Last evening's
clove-head
onmyoji (yin-yang master)
doesn't lack
knowledge of
personal circumstances.

This letter
came out and caused great laughter.

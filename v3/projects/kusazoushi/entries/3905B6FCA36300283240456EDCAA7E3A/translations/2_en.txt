In Suruga Province, upstream along the Abe River,
there lived a man named Seiemon who
came to Edo every year
to trade in tea.
He was skilled in business
and though he lacked nothing, being an established
Edo merchant, he passed the business to his son
Seibie. For wholesale dealings,
needless to say, and even for small customers,
he would provide one bag of new tea each.
Having built relationships over many years,
he carefully instructed his son and had him
prepare everything without oversight.

"There are no
female customers
present."

"Have them return
quite
early."

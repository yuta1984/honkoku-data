For five or six
days straight,
they continued,
looking as though
they were
intoxicated
by tea—
while that
may be said,
they were truly
drunk.
These
two men
finally
began to
head home.
No matter what,
Seikou
was young,
so his
handling of things
was

skillful.
The retired man
was mocked
even by shinzo and kamuro,
and when the retiree
put on
airs,
no matter what he did,
nobody cared, so they made fun of him.
This impertinent tradition
has become
the language of connoisseurs
even in today's world.

"Retired
sir,
when will
you be
coming?"

"Good
morning."

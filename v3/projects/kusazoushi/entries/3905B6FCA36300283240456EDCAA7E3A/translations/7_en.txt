Here there is
a wealthy
retired person
named Ittoku.
He has been enjoying tea since the Shotoku era, but
without any refinement in thick tea or thin tea ceremony,
he prefers sencha and drinks
excessively,
yet has never been
intoxicated by tea, sleeping until
past four in the morning.
Hearing that
people get
intoxicated
by tea,
he feels envious,
and since this is his specialty,
when he comes to Seibei's place
he asks, "Have you ever
been intoxicated
by tea?"
Seibei replies that although he
engages in the business,
he has never been intoxicated by it.
As an experiment,
the two of them desperately
drink second-grade tea.

Drinking and
blowing,
drinking and
dancing

Ittoku and
Seibei,
the two of them
making noise,
making noise,
drinking
second-grade tea,
singing
ditties
to each other.
"My stomach has become
quite swollen.
Let's dance a little
for digestion," they
start making a commotion,
just like being
drunk
on sake,
but without
quarreling,
knocking over and twisting
small goods shops,
making noise shamelessly.
The household members are startled
seeing for the first time
someone truly
intoxicated by tea.

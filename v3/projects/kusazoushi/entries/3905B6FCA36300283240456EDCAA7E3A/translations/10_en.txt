Both men
became thoroughly
intoxicated with excitement
and began performing comic skits.
They called upon
a Yoshiwara
expert
to have him perform Sukeroku.
The retired courtesan
played the stylish
role, while Seikou
forced himself into
the Sukeroku role,
wearing only
a tea-server's
hat and a formal
crested kimono

with geta sandals.

Being intoxicated
by real tea,
they shamelessly
performed their skit.
From this time forward,
amateur
theatrical performances
came to be called
"tea-serving
theater" (chaban kyōgen).

In truth,
when he played
Agemaki,
he felt
embarrassed.

"Bravo!
Master Ichikawa!"
they called.

This was
the state of affairs
regarding Sukeroku's
previous
crossing
performance.

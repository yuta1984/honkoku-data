As Seibei began
fortune-telling
and it
prospered,
an enormous number
of people came to ask for his services.

"My son who
is thirteen years old
was sent out
for apprenticeship,
but since
yesterday
he hasn't been seen.
Please divine
this
for me," one said.

"This appears
to be quite
troublesome.
There is
no need
to worry.
He will not
go beyond
about one hundred thirty ri.
He will
surely
return," he divined.

"My son also
went to a funeral
yesterday
but hasn't returned yet."

"He is in the
north or south
direction, but has sufficient water
and food.
There is no danger
to his life. He will
take a wife, but please
endure much
hardship. Since I
sent out one
previously,
this time is
very important.
This does not depend
on compatibility.
Don't speak of every
water matter,
let morning sleep continue
until natural awakening, and if you
occasionally show him
plays,
whether it's the year of the cat or year of the bear,
it will be fine," he
divined as if
it were true.

"That fortune-telling
suggests a pilgrimage
to Ise.
Perhaps
...
I was
worried."

"If you emerge
from behind a large temple,
tomorrow
some money
will come in,
I think."

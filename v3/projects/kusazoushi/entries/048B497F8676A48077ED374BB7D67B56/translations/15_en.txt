When Tora eloped and was returned by the customer, rumors spread not only through Oiso's five districts but throughout Kamakura as well, making it impossible to call her back and have her work in the pleasure quarter. However, letting such an expensive investment sit idle would also be a great loss. While Denzaemon pondered what to do, the talk throughout Kamakura was that Denzaemon's handling was poor and his moral instruction was vulgar. In this world where "walls have ears," once a bad reputation spreads, she couldn't even be sent to an unlicensed brothel. Resigned to the situation, he decided to get whatever money he could and send her to Sukeshige's place, so he sent Soroku, a sophisticated go-between, as his messenger.

"Sukeshige-san, I came to your place today because someone asked me to. First, you are as reliable as a great lord's son, with admirable resolve. The other day when Miss Tora eloped to you, an ordinary person would not have thought of the consequences and would have kept her saying 'yes, yes,' but you returned the woman you loved, saying that an eloped courtesan could not be kept. This truly shows the firm resolve of a samurai. Denzaemon of Oiso-ya is so grateful for your thoughtful consideration that he says he wants to give you Tora. Whether as your concubine or whatever, that girl will take care of you for life. However, being the kind of person you are, you probably won't accept her for nothing. If you could provide fifty ryo as entertainment money, that would be fine. Since this request comes from the well-known Soroku, his reputation won't be damaged either. However you decide, please handle this favorably. Half the amount would be manageable too."

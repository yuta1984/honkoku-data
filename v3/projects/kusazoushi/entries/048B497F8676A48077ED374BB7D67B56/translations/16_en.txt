At that time, with Soroku of Oiso-ya serving as go-between, Tora and Sukeshige became husband and wife as was customary. However, since his younger brothers Tokimune and Kojiro had not yet completed their training, they could not carry out their revenge by sneaking into their enemy's bedchamber together as brothers. That will be shown in the sequel, so as a matter of courtesy, this spring story ends here.

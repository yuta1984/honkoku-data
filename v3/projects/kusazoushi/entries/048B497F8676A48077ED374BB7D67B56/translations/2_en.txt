Year after year taking up the brush to write this long-standing story, in the spring of the fourth year of Kankyū when the new year dawns, though the sovereign's reign has many regulations and even the ceremonial hemp dress is auspiciously folded away like the small pine trees swaying in the wind, what remains unchanged is the Soga brothers' resentment. Though they know their father's enemy is Kudō Saemon-no-jō, since no one in the realm can match his威光 (power and influence), rather than attempting to strike him down immediately, they cannot even catch sight of his face. If this continues, spending days and months would not fulfill their true intention, so their retainer Kiō Shinzaemon teaches the brothers a lesson as if telling a story.

【Kiō's speech】
Listen, young masters, you spend your time in this world only reading books and studying literature, but you well know the principle that one cannot share the same heaven with one's father's enemy. Rather than just reading storybooks, let us quickly devise a way to gain access to Suketsune-sama. First, to memorize the enemy's appearance: tomorrow, the 10th, when Yoritomo-kō makes his pilgrimage to Hakone-yama Gongen shrine, not only will all the great lords attend, but our enemy Suketsune-sama will surely appear as well. After Yoritomo-kō's return, we shall wait for Suketsune-sama's departure and you must carefully memorize his features.

【The Soga brothers' speech】
Well done, Kiō! I too have been thinking the same thing daily. Tomorrow's pilgrimage is indeed a fortunate opportunity. Since we go to Suketsune's presence without prior notice, while waiting, you must come with us as well.

From now on, we shall cease this crude talk of revenge and instead rely on Hachiman no Saburō, gain Suketsune's trust, make him lower his guard, and ensure he remains motionless so we can accomplish our heart's desire with certainty.

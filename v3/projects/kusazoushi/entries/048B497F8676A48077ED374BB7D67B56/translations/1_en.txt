Year after year the flowers look the same, but year after year the Soga [stories] are never identical.
From the spring kyōgen plays of the Genroku and Enpō eras, this seed was planted, and by the time of Hakuen Tosshi (referring to Sawamura Tosshi, with the stage name house Kii-no-kuni-ya), it bloomed and bore fruit. With branches and leaves flourishing in the roles of young men and leading actors, it has now become the world of Kii-no-kuni-ya and Takino-ya theaters. The intent of this illustrated storybook is the publisher's wish to sell affordable entertainment and ukiyo-e "grains" with half the humor of theatrical plots, enjoyed over a drink. As the beginning of business in the first spring of the Snake year, I humbly present this to the kabuki playwrights.

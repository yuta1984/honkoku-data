Kyōsuke had brought along his servant Bekunai, but thinking that Kagerō was a loose-tongued fellow, he deceived and killed him on the road.

"Since no one other than myself knows about Oman's murder, I won't be suspected by anyone."

"So you're going to kill him? What a cruel way to do things. Ugh."

"That's good reasoning. Die quickly."

After this, Yokogawa Kyōsuke, regarding the matter of killing Oman, [details unclear] understanding the situation, fled to Kōshū with only a small lead to rely on.

Thus Yokogawa Kyōsuke was hiding in the shadow of a mountain in Kōshū when he saw a blind female musician (goze) living alone in a neighboring village. Being naturally lustful and immoral, Kyōsuke repeatedly made advances toward this goze.

The goze also took a liking to Kyōsuke and, thinking his feelings were sincere, eventually exchanged marriage vows with him.

They finally became husband and wife.

"Really, isn't this wonderful? There couldn't be such tender hearts as ours."

Yokogawa Kyōsuke became husband and wife with the goze, and they spent their days together with him teaching calligraphy and shamisen instruction. However, the goze became pregnant and was already seven months along.

Kyōsuke developed a wandering heart and began to find it troublesome that his wife was growing heavier with child.

【Goze's dialogue】
"The baby is moving so much in my belly. My dear husband..."

【Kyōsuke's dialogue】
"What an unexpected thing. If a baby crying 'wah wah' is born to you, a blind woman, you won't be able to raise it."

Since Yokogawa Kyōsuke was an immoral man, he found the goze troublesome, and thinking to kill her secretly in the middle of the night, one night he cut her down, abandoned her in a field, and fled.

【Yokogawa's dialogue】
"Now this troublesome burden is completely cleared away. What a relief."

The goze had been deeply attached (to him).

In her agony, the goze bit through her husband Kyōsuke's shoulder and died.

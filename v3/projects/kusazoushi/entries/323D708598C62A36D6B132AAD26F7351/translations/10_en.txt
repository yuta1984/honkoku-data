The tengu had never even dreamed of women's arrogance, but because Densuke spoke up, he now wanders about looking. Though invisible to human eyes, he peeks through pull-down windows or watches from targets - one cannot be careless. While pressing his nose forward, this lady here is surely the wife of a great tengu.

Wearing a haori, she's like a frog in a well with wild ambitions. Knowing nothing of the world, she thinks "there's nothing more skillful, excellent, or clever than myself." She meddles in everything, believing she possesses great wealth. With her fan and such - how presumptuous and outrageous! Though people call her "grilled snipe eggplant," she pays no heed to the tengu.

White goods, combs and hairpins in fashionable colors - even things others did first, she acts as if they were her own ideas. Her arrogance shows at the tip of her nose. This expression "tip of the nose" naturally originated from the tengu.

Oh my

Well now, at times

Still spicy

"I'm asking for this town's hair ornament - the ones with just spots at the tips are good"

"Rather than mere arrogance, those with excessive pride are snatched up like fried tofu and brought into the demon realm. Great tengu and small tengu gather, and though they are placed under tens of thousands of tengu cavalry, even throughout all the provinces of Japan, this is quite a harsh country and not easily accomplished.

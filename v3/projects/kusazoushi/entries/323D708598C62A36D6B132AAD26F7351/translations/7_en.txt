Densuke fabricated the entire truth into lies, making everyone feel at ease. Regarding the matter of large tengu and small tengu: small tengu have longer male coverings than large tengu, and because their coverings are large, they cannot distinguish between large and small. This is the logic. When inquiring while having drinks, those who work thirty days without a single day of rest are called large tengu, while small tengu have one day off per month, hence they are called small tengu. In exchange, large tengu receive fifty mon per day as pocket money, while small tengu get twenty-four mon each. Therefore, at places of entertainment, fifty is called "large" and twenty-four mon is called "small." This is how the distinction between large and small works, he explains.

Densuke, being a cunning fellow, bustles about keeping watch, yet without any suspicious clothing, he appears tired. When asked why he doesn't approach his superiors, he retorts, "You say the most outrageous things. How could there be female tengu? Preposterous!" When greeted this way, the response is: "Indeed, I have never seen nor heard of such a thing, but what if I put it this way? Young ones are called 'tengu offspring.' Without females, there should be no way for children to exist. If you think small tengu are females, that's not quite right either. Even if you say 'there are none,' one cannot let their guard down with today's tengu." He presses with this logic.

You don't seem ordinary either, yet you don't know about worldly people, but from that point on, women are not allowed...

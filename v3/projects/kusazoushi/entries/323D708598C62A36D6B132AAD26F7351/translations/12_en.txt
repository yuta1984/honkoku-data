Because of Densuke's own smooth talking, he was assigned this major role. Though it wasn't entirely without merit, when he came with the intention of bringing his familiar woman to the theater box, he was caught by many people and interrogated in various ways.

When he said, "I came with the intention of making you ladies into tengu," they understood that Densuke had fallen into delusion. "If we don't return her, and if I myself don't go back, this plan will be abandoned, and the female tengu will become arrogant like in a revenge tale. I guarantee it. The tengu were also at ease, but there isn't a single woman among them. There's nothing frightening about it at all. Women have no concern about becoming tengu. I cannot guarantee they'll become serpents." Thus, Densuke's story is presented exactly as it happened for your viewing.

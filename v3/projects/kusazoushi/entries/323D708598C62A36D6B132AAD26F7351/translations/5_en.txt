"Tengu may seem like beings who would snatch away anything from the good citizens of the city, but they never do such things.

When they need something from any shop in town, they purchase it properly and never harm people. In this way, even arrogance seems acceptable."

"I don't mean to boast, but please compare with those in the ordinary world and see for yourself."

"Though it's not the current fashion, I'll take that light green garment. Don't get so worked up over such trifles. Even after coming here, your habits don't stop."

Here, the flower-blooming old man had
a family temple called Saimyōji, where there was
a priest who loved gardening.
However, a crab appeared in this area
and cut many plants with its claws.
When the crab cut the precious plum, cherry,
and pine trees of Saikyōji temple with its claws,
it happened that the old man and his wife
were visiting the temple,
so they asked him to sprinkle
that ash and make flowers bloom
on the dead trees.

The old man took out that ash
and sprinkled it, and the plum, cherry,
and pine trees returned
to their original state.
"Look at this!
How wonderful!
What white blossoms!"

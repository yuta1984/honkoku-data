Long ago,
crabs had no
eyes
but had voices; earthworms had
eyes
but no voices.
But they exchanged voices and
eyes with each other, and finally became husband and wife.
Since everyone calls earthworms "mimizu,"
they changed the name to "omeme" (eyes).
　Even in trees, at the bottom of mud, truly in our dwelling place,
Mr. Crab, don't abandon us even if we're lacking
Since I now have no eyes but a good voice,
I'll become a blind female performer and with my proud voice singing long songs,
I'll
love you

How joyful! 
　I too, now that
I have eyes,
can walk sideways
　as I wish　　　　　　　After all, people are more than earthworms, if only the heart
　　　　　　　　　　　　　Therefore, from now on, being refined is
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　admirable!

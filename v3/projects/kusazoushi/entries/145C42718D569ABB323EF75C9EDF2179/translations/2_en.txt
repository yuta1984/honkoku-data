Here lived a man named Kuhei of the Ikeya. He made a living through various writing work, but through business acumen and cleverness, by heaven's blessing he became a successful merchant favored by the shogun. With his family's prosperity, he had a son whom he named Yoshimatsu. The boy was intelligent, well-behaved, and strong-willed. When a second son was born, he named him Jinroku, and the couple loved each other and rejoiced without limit.

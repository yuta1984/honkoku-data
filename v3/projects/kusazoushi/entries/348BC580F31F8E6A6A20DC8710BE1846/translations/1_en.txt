From New Year's Day when the year returns again,
Hoping it might become poetry for young ladies,
Kiyonaga depicted these scenes
And titled them at the bottom of the calendar.
The number naturally reached seven types.
The master of Eijudō said all treasures are contained within this,
And further requested to transfer them to woodblocks. Still, in the deep spring
With the fragrance of plums and pine of the first Rat Day, entrusting a thousand generations,
At the beginning of this elegant pictorial style, I offer congratulations for a million years of longevity.

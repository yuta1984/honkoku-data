Here in Edo's Minami-machi 2-chome lived an old man named Nakane Jūbei. Previously, he had served as a low-ranking official in the Yotsuya area, but when his master's operational funds of 500 ryō were stolen, he became a masterless wanderer and lived in poverty. However, being an honest and frugal man, he thought to himself: "Even though I lost the money entrusted to me by my lord through my own fault, though it may not be a samurai's proper wish, I would somehow like to gather the full sum of 500 ryō and return it to him." He devised various schemes, but in this world, money is the hardest thing to obtain.

However, he had two daughters. The elder was named Ofusa and the younger Oito, and both were exceptionally beautiful. Being naturally gifted, two or three years ago he sent his elder daughter Ofusa to work at Shin-Yoshiwara for 100 ryō, hoping somehow to raise the money to repay his master. But the remaining 400 ryō could not be obtained quickly, and he was deeply troubled by various concerns.

Wife: "Otsuna, I would very much like to fulfill your wish."

Daughter Oito: "Yes, please have some tea."

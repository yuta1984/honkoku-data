Jūbei listened to the detailed circumstances, and combining the three hundred ryō that Ofusa had brought with the money he had carefully saved up over time, he presented it respectfully. This worked out extremely well. Since Jūbei had no desire to return to service, he retired, and his son-in-law Sashichi was granted his original stipend of two hundred koku as before.

Since Ofusa was the elder sister, she became the principal wife, while the younger sister Oito became a concubine. In place of Sashichi's alias Segawa, the Hamamura-ya presented both beauties side by side on stage, and they prospered for a long time.

A happy ending indeed.

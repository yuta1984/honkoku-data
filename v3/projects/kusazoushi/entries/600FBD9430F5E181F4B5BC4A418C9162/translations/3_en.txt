Here again, in Yotsuya, there was a man named Saschichi, the younger brother of one Matsugaya Sonenosuke. He was a stylish, sophisticated man of current fashion, a worldly lothario who observed such types from the sidelines. Being such a person, in this world where any reasonably handsome man gets compared to the heartthrobs of Yumi-cho or Honjo, this Saschichi was also previously a rare specimen of a man. Therefore, whether widow, maiden, another's wife, or maidservant - regardless of station - there was no woman who would not fall for him at first sight.

Without anyone saying so explicitly, he was especially renowned around Yotsuya Segawa and such places. His elder brother Sonenosuke found him to be a troublesome man and, fearing what his master might hear, had now essentially disowned him.

He had developed a somewhat intimate relationship with Jūbei's wife Otsuna and had taken to visiting the ronin's household daily. However, Jūbei was a kind-hearted man who showed him compassion.

"Listen, Saschichi-san, from the day you first came to this house, I began to think you were lovely. Due to my karma, please make me your wife. If only you would consent, I would ask mother's permission and would like to become a proper married couple under heaven's blessing."

"Your feelings make me happy, but there's the dilemma of my parents' disapproval, and moreover, my obligation is to Jūbei-sama, to whom I owe a great debt. If this matter were to be discovered by the couple, I fear their anger would be pitiful. I would like to say 'please forgive just this much,' but I too, from afar, understand your feelings..."

Oito, having fallen for Saschichi, pleaded with all her heart. From this point on, Saschichi and Oito became intimate lovers and lived together.

Preface to Strange Tales for Children
At some time in the past, at some northern lady's residence,
many young female attendants were kept in service,
and as companions to while away tedious hours, various
entertainments were provided. It was at the end of the ninth month,
when the sounds of insects had become sparse, and the first winter rain
drummed on the eaves, causing restless sleep.

Seeing this, everyone exclaimed "What is this?" and were startled and made a commotion. The inner garden, which had been dry until then without a drop of moisture, suddenly became as if water had been poured over it, with water pooling in the low-lying areas. Those who were in the garden were surprised by this, while those above called out "Medicine! Water!" and finally the woman came back to her senses. After lying down and resting for a while, she returned to normal.

When they asked her what had happened, she told them the aforementioned events. "In any case, it chased me all the way to this house, but I don't know what happened after that," she said. This must be what people call a kappa (water demon).

It had chased her to this house where the kappa must have fallen over. At that time, the water from its head spilled out, which is why water appeared in the garden—or so they discussed among themselves. The master Gorotoku, having carefully observed and heard all this, dismissed the maidservant that very day and sent her back to her home.

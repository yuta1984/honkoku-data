With such a transformation in his words, Sozaemon was also astonished and remained silent for a while. Eventually he said, "I did not know that you had come to understand so well the principle that all beings in the three realms are our children. Please forgive my repetitive words from earlier. Even so, with such a clear body and mind as yours, what was the reason for your behavior until now? Could there be any other such noble wisdom?" And he prostrated himself in reverence. "Nevertheless, from this point forward, please accept this money and use it to help with good deeds and Buddhist services for your daughter. I shall hurry back and tell my family about this matter." As he tried to stand up, the man restrained him, saying, "I will not accept this money, no matter the amount. There would be delusion upon enlightenment. Please take it back quickly.

Originally, even things that fall under the gaze of great desire and immobility, if obstructed, might again become signs of delusion. Quickly, quickly!" So Sozaemon, having no choice, took it back and told his clan about what had happened. Those who had been waiting for Sozaemon's return heard this matter and felt both joy and suspicion, experiencing both emotion and doubt as they returned to their respective lodgings. From then on, Washizo's evil thoughts became clear and bright due to his daughter's unnatural death, and without any darkness whatsoever, he went to those whom he had wronged, confessed his sins, devoted himself completely, and day and night without distinction, used all his energy to repay his debts. People who saw and heard this recognized the sincerity of his true heart.

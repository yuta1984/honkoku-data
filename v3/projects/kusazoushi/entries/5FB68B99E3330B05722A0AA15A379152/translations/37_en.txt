They received the seal of approval from the two Deva Kings of Sansho Temple and set sail.

Now, when we inquire into the true nature (honji) of the two Deva Kings, they are said to be Dainichi Nyorai of both the Womb and Diamond realms. Secretly leaving the lotus throne of the密厳 Pure Land's Flower Treasury World, they temporarily manifest as divided bodies to mingle among the dust of this defiled world. Therefore, they shine the light of beneficial action according to karmic conditions throughout all heavens, and begin to moisten the four seas with the drops of compassion that extinguish the three poisons of greed, anger, and ignorance. Taking the forms of yaksha demons and evil spirits, they demonstrate the virtue of subduing vengeful enemies. Their appearance with open mouth reveals the principle of the primordial unborn nature of the letter "A," while their form with closed mouth expresses the aspect of the unobtainable nature of the letter "HUM." Internally, they conceal the merit of compassionately receiving sentient beings and save those without karmic connections, while externally they manifest the virtue of awesome and wrathful power to punish evil rebels.

Thus, sometimes they protect the Buddhist teachings and use divine power to dispel the four maras and three obstacles, and at other times they guard the nation and repel the mighty enemies of entire armies. How could one doubt this? The miraculous efficacy of the two Deva Kings at this time was truly witnessed and related by the late Dharma Seal Kuwa.

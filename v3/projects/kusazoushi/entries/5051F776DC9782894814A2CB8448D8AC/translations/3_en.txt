Preface to "The Universal Household Account Book"

Frugality and miserliness are like narcissus and green onions. Though their forms appear similar, miserliness has a detestable stench, while frugality has loveable flowers that do not wither even in frost and snow. That one can eventually meet the time of ichiyō raifuku (the return of yang energy/good fortune) is due to the virtue of flowers that never wither.

Making economical management one's principle and devising ingenious methods, drawing eyes and noses on household items and adding hands and feet to them - this too is part of the efficient binding of a household account book. First, I record this at the beginning of the New Year.

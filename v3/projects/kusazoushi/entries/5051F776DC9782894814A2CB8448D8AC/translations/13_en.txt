There is a saying "Bunbuku Chagama ni ke ga haeta" (hair grew on the Bunbuku tea kettle), and when the troublesome tea kettle became a medicine kettle, it was considered even more cowardly. Hair grew in the middle of the characters for "yakan" (kettle), turning it into "yake no kan-hachi" (desperate Kan-hachi). The silver tea kettle heard that there was a small gold kettle at that location, immediately barged in and begged "hand over the kettle to us." However, since the silver tea kettle side had originally apologized for their circumstances and paid a deposit, they argued that there was no way to hand it over to the troublesome tea kettle. When it wouldn't listen and started causing a big commotion, the silver tea kettle tied a rope to its head and dragged it around by its stone belly, which felt satisfying.

♪The cracked pot also heard that the small gold kettle had been ransomed out and came to the silver tea kettle's side out of jealousy. So the tea bowl arranged for straw to be brought, and had the straw burned inside the cracked pot's head. From this, this pot developed metallic properties and became a real pot, able to enter the world - this was entirely due to the silver tea kettle's kindness. When the medicine kettle saw that the cracked pot had reformed its heart, it too regretted its past wrongdoings and became a proper medicine kettle father, growing gentle - what a touching thing.

Portable Shrine

The priest was troubled about how to hide his neck, so he attached Shiga boots and placards, and offered his buttocks to a hunchbacked wealthy patron as a ceremonious meal tray, jokingly. He elevated a courtesan as an iki (sophisticated) man, and moreover, wrapped himself elegantly in refinement. Being deeply jealous, when the courtesan went to her lover's place, he would secretly stick out only his head from the door of the bedroom full of dignity. At such times, it is said that borrowing the help of makeup is indeed the proper way.

A kamuro (young attendant) came to light tobacco from this fire, crying out in great commotion, "Master, your head is acting up again!"

If you take the chimney sweep's pole and just leave it there after hitting with it, you'll be scolded by the courtesan again.

The expression "to crane one's neck while waiting" began from this time.

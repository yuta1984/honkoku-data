The tanuki pretended to sleep like in a picture, thinking that with two masks and pillows, a courtesan might come. But when night fell, he had started to expose his "eight-mat room" (tanuki's testicles). With sake and tobacco butts around, he endured terrible hardship and anguish. When the courtesan finally arrived, he thought to say something sarcastic, so from beside the pillow he said, "The long 'I humbly present' from Act Seven's letter gets us nowhere" (a line from Chushingura). In the end, in a fit of anger over the handsome man not coming, she pulled out her hairpin and slashed at the tatami mats in frustration. Seeing this, the tanuki inadvertently let out a fart without meaning to.

"Ridiculous, this tatami is all the more irritating. And the fur has apparently changed. The bubbling tea kettle has sprouted fur."

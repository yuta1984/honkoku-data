At that point, Kuronosuke Inari appeared and said: "Zenzai, zenzai! Well, well, this is Kuronosuke Inari Daimyojin, protected and preserved by the white sake seller. I've been eagerly waiting for this meeting's 'tsu' (connoisseur), and with this first 'tsu' bag, I shall perfect the great 'tsu.' You monsters, this has been well worth the wait! Now, with my supernatural power, I shall lead you into the way of the great connoisseur."

"Well now, that's hardly unreasonable. There's no need to push and shove," he thought, and getting his nose tweaked was nothing new—this was the very source of great connoisseurship.

[Continuation from above]
From now on, the monsters shall immediately conduct their assigned trades. First, in this gathering, he shall call himself Tamaya Imasaburo and run a brothel. The three-eyed demon and one-eyed goblin shall be paired together, renamed Yotsumeya Iruzo, and this too shall become a brothel. The tanuki, when he beats his belly drum, shall beat two drums and make his living as a drum-bearer entertainer. The tengu, having the disposition to speak at length about arrogance, shall become a drum-bearer called Chokyu Banri, and playfully calling the portable shrine demon "Mikoku," he shall take the name "shamiko dancer." The kappa shall be given a name like Uchikawaya Tarosuke. He would run a brothel, but eh, since the cat-demon is called "koma, koma," taking the "ko" character from "komata," [she becomes] a female entertainer called "Komaji."

The night heron shall open a brothel in Kyomachi, change his name to "Sakiya Gosuke," keep a snow woman and make her an evening courtesan called "Yukimasu"—though that sounds too much like a margin note from the Pillow Book, so "Yukiashi" would be better. It's truly grateful to have friends who take care of even the smallest details.

Since this is Yoshiwara's shadow realm, it's perfect for monsters to dwell in.

The portable shrine demon was skilled at Echigo dancing and would occasionally dance at banquets. The current shamiko dance [the text should continue but the continuation cannot be found. This overlaps with the content of line 31. Shamiko dance was popular during the Tenmei era and is said to originate from Siamese dancing.]

Everyone, everyone was speechless.

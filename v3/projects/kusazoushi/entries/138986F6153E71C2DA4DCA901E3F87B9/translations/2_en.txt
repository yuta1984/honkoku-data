　　　Preface　　　　　　　　Written by Kyōden
The title "Things One Wishes to See" is neither
about courtesans (seijo) in poetry,
nor about daily mundane matters (hiyose). 
It is simply about peering into the dressing rooms of monsters - 
there is probably nothing one would want to see more than frightening things.
When I proofread this kusazōshi (illustrated book),
I wrote it down to the rhythm of "Chitose-kora" as follows:
　　　　　　　　This master
　　　　　　　　　　Nishi-no-miya

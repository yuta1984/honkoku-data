Mikoshi moved beyond Hakone and gradually became very prosperous, accumulating great wealth. The demons who had long dwelt in that land came to rely heavily on him, and they all came to serve under Mikoshi, respectfully calling him "boss, boss." Mikoshi, being truly experienced and skillful, became intimate with his demon companions and taught them various methods of haunting. He instructed them on how to gain the advantage: "In any case, it's better not to be too persistent in frightening people. Don't bother with people wearing Oshima broad sleeves or those with power papers on their heads. Generally, don't mess with sane people even if they seem weak, but those who are unruly should be thoroughly frightened." He taught and instructed his companions in various ways, so now even his fellow demons became considerate, and during the Hour of the Ox (around 2-3 AM), they all properly washed their feet and retired.

Truly, even more reliable than the natural cycle of five days of wind and ten days of rain, even the demons never missed their proper timing. May this world last forever.

"I frightened an old man like Yoichibei and snatched his purse - this is fifty ryo after a long time, how grateful!" But when he looked inside, there was only about five go of rice and some fried rice. How annoying!

Mikoshi-nyudo appears nightly at that spot, frightening passersby and robbing them of money. With the wisdom that comes with age (literally "older than a turtle's shell"), he can well distinguish between those with crooked hearts and honest people, and doesn't frighten people indiscriminately. Inexperienced monsters who frighten honest people get into terrible trouble. Behind honest people, gods dwell, so monsters cannot frighten them there. Therefore, if children don't lie and remain honest, they need not fear Momotaro's grandfather or nyudo demons.

"Oh my! If you had come a little earlier, it would have been better. I just sent my response away. The shop apprentice down the road was waiting for you."

"Tonight there's a hundred ghost stories session at the temple below. If we could go there, the business would be so good we couldn't bear it."

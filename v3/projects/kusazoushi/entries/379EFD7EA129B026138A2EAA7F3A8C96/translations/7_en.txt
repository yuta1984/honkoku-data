The palanquin goblin had gone to the trouble of having bellows made and suffered a great loss, wondering what to do, when a fox living in the village at the foot of the mountain came and said: "On such-and-such a day, the young men of the village will be telling ghost stories, and I must frighten them or there's no point in my living in this area." However, he continued, "But if I appear, they'll just say 'it's only a fox' - how disappointing! Fortunately, I heard that you, master, are living on this mountain, so I've come to ask for your help. Would you please come with some of your disciples? When they tell ghost stories and only a fox appears, they'll say 'nothing really appeared' - it's so frustrating to have the area spoken of as having no monsters at all."

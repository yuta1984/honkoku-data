The Four-Four Brass Mouse (Also known as: Mouse Shop Banner)

Just as field mice transform into quails【Note 1】, this brass mouse also transforms - when it becomes rain, it nourishes its parents, and when it transforms into temple bells or golden Buddhas, it becomes a seed of enlightenment. It constantly feeds on tobacco leaves and exhales smoke from its mouth. It comforts the loneliness of solitary moments, dispels the melancholy of travel, and serves as entertainment for guests. It is a mouse with abilities but no severe poison. Because it makes the sound "shinchū~" four times sixteen times each, it is named the Four-Four Brass Mouse.

If one becomes intoxicated by the poison of this mouse's tar, one should drink sugar water, which will immediately cure it. Also, when bitten by a snake, if you apply this mouse's tar, it will remove the poison. It is also good for viper bites. Since this is reliable information from authoritative books, I record it here for people's benefit.

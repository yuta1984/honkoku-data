In my idleness, facing my writing desk in the twilight hours, when I casually unfold and view the picture scrolls of Toba Sōjō featuring mortars with wings, and the frivolous illustrations in red books showing the Mikoshine-nyūdō wearing striped cotton garments, everything that comes to mind appears to be nothing but monsters. The medicine kettle becomes a tengu, and stains on the wall I suspect to be ghosts. However, when I recall the old saying "If you see something strange but do not find it strange, then there is nothing strange about it," I realize it is merely the delusion of my own observing mind. There is nothing more frightening than the demons of the human heart. All you children, you must by all means vanquish the monsters in your hearts. Do you understand?

Long life and prosperity!

Thanks to the generous patronage of all our customers, Kyōden's shop prospers more each day, for which I am deeply grateful. We have created new and especially curious designs for cut paper, tobacco paper, nose paper, picture bags, pipes, and other items according to the year. Please do purchase them.

All the street vendors selling items claiming to be "Kyōden's work" are not my creations whatsoever.

The Money Tree

The money tree seems to be something that doesn't exist at all in this world, but that is not so. Everyone has one in their household and possesses its seeds. However, because they neglect their family trade and are careless in their work, the ground of their hearts becomes wasteland, their capital fields lack fertilizer, and even when they sow seeds, no flowers bloom nor fruit bear. Great fortune lies with heaven, but small fortune lies in diligent work. When one does not neglect their respective livelihood, how could it not be a money tree?

What kind of thing is the money tree, you ask? First, the money tree of a merchant's house has flowers like the shape of a brass elephant, leaves like code papers, and fruit like abacus beads.

The craftsman's money tree has flowers like wood shavings, leaves resembling trowels, and bears fruit like chisels. The farmer's money tree has flowers like rice-planting maidens' hats, leaves that are hoes and plows, and bears the fruit of five grains. The samurai's money tree has flowers like targets, leaves like wooden swords and arrows, and bears fruit like musket balls.

Let all classes - samurai, farmers, craftsmen, and merchants - each cultivate the fields of their family trade and accumulate their money trees. Do you understand? Do you understand? Even a three-year-old child knows such reasoning, but without being told, there is negligence.

If anyone wishes to laugh at my lecture, please laugh.

"Children, be quiet and listen to the lecture."

"Indeed, that's a very reasonable lecture. The money tree is in our own homes."

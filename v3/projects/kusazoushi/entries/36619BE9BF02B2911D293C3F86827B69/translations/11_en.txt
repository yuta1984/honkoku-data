The Bug of Bad Temper

The bug of bad temper is an insect with many wrinkles on its forehead and a rigid body. It greatly favors heavy drinking and devours mortars, pestles, plates, and bowls by smashing them. This bug proliferates in the Country of Willfulness, in the village of Caprice. The leisurely priest Kankan of Yuuyuuji temple performs exorcism by sprinkling lukewarm water from Yururi Kansu's pot and saves souls from this bug. When a human being is possessed by this bug, they will ultimately destroy themselves.

One must be cautious of willfulness and caprice, and must not let this bug approach.

May you be saved from the sufferings of the realm of fighting demons (Asura)

The Six-Legged Palanquin, commonly called "Sanmai"

Quoting from the Natural History of the Ancient Battlefield Pine of Bell-hanging:

It is recorded in detail that the three-legged frog can well avenge enemies, and the three-legged metal stand can well support a kettle, but the six-legged palanquin is something never before seen. It is extremely swift of foot, as if flying through the air. It does not come out during the day, but when night falls, it hides in the darkness and cries "Hai kago, kago" (Hey palanquin, palanquin).

It constantly feeds on tips (sake-te).

The Hide of Lies

The beast called "Lie" has a form like a flying squirrel and possesses supernatural power that flows from its eyes to its nose, deceiving people. Its facial skin is thick, it has two tongues, and it is a beast with no hair on its tongue-drum (throat). Long ago, two hunters named Meppō Yahachi and Manzara no Manhachi (meaning "of ten thousand things, only eight are true") are said to have shot and killed it with blank shots.

It is also called by another name: "the hide of a spy." When made into a purse, it is called "a purse made from spy hide."

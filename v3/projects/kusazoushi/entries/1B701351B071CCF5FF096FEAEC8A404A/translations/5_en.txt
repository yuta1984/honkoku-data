Kōnoshin became young as he had wished and dressed himself in contemporary fashion. Since this happened suddenly, he had his existing kenpō komon (constitutional small-pattern kimono) re-dyed in blue-tea color. Unexpectedly, the small pattern looked remarkably youthful, and this pattern became fashionable. Now people deliberately go to fabric shops to have old garments re-dyed and re-tailored.

"Since I've become young, this is auspicious, so let me treat everyone to sake," he said, and removed the lid from a sake barrel, entertaining even passersby on the street all day long. It is said that the current expression "let's buy sake" originated from this time. It was truly a remarkable occurrence.

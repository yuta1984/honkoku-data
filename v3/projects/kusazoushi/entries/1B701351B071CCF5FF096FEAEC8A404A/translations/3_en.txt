During the Kōshin vigil, when Kōnoshin drew water in a basin to wash his face in the middle of the night, he had transformed into the youthful appearance of someone aged twenty-four or twenty-five. "How mysterious this is! Could this be a dream? Surely I couldn't be seeing dreams due to fever."

Next to him was a man called Yohei, who still looked sleepy but had become twenty-two or twenty-three years old. Saying "Whether it's Kōshin or whatever, sleeping is best," he paid no mind and had been sleeping since sunset, snoring loudly until the sun would hit his face the next morning.

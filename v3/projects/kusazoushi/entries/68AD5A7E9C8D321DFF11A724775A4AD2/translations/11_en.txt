Saburō-hei, having grown tired of this island, waits to go to another island when a sailing boat comes riding on the waves. Every country is the same - seeing travelers pass by, they demand the customary tip (gratuity).

When he climbs onto one island, he finds women's sandals arranged in great numbers along the beach. Could this be the legendary "Island of Women" he had heard about? He'd like to try on the sandals, but being naked, he feels embarrassed and hides himself, as it wouldn't look proper. Indeed, you can't have two good things at once.

First, how about these sandals? The nakamuki sandals have parent soles with light yellow broad straps and three-layer backing. These seem quite beautiful. The soft black ones would suit a connoisseur. The smooth rope ones and the setta from Ōtoshi Island, even with their silk nose straps that the sponsors provided, can't be relied upon - they have five-layer backing, but there are those who would buy them anyway. I don't know how expensive they might be, but it's worrying.

It's like dreaming within a dream.

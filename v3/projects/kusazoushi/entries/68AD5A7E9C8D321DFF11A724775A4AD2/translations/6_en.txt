Where shall we
go?

How
foolish.

During the reign of Lord Minamoto no Yoritomo,
the military leader of Kamakura,
there was island touring by Kobayashi no Asai,
and later, due to the mediation
in the mountains between
the Yoshitsune brothers,
it became Fuwa.
First,
opening the capital,
Musashibō Benkei accompanied
the lord on island touring.
From there,
learning Japanese customs,
favoring stylish things,
on Ashinaga Island
long hair is fashionable.
Though kimono fabric
may run out,
hair must be
three jō long—
an unprecedented thing.
Thus the wives
rejoice that
their hems don't tear.

For shining
in sandals,
no drums
are needed.

This island has a peculiar mechanism where holes open up in one's belly no matter what happens, and nothing profitable can be seen. Women dislike riding on poles, and those who carry money in their pockets have it pushed into these holes - what a dreadful country this is! As for Saburō-hei...

Even when tired,
there are no holes
in his belly

"Well now,
yassa!"

*cough cough*

"A short drink,
please, I
beg of you"

Even when cut
and kneaded,
it cannot be ridden
If one dislikes boats,
it's troublesome
to go out for fun
No matter how you look at it,
it's eerie
and unsettling

Rushing to
a plaster
merchant's
shop
Even if brought
as a sideshow,
it doesn't seem likely
to cause a sensation
How boorish
within
this wretched island

"Hey there, boy!"
"To the boy..."

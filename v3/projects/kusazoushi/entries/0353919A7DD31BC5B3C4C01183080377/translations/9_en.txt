The Great King of Chinese Confections heard that Aruheitou (hard candy) had bought the tea bowl and conducted various investigations, but since Aruheitou's whereabouts were unknown, he decided to behead his son without excuse to Higashi-yama and use this as an apology to Japan. He sent Kanrotou (sweet dew candy) as an inspector, accompanied by Kaseitakusan for this purpose.

Keshitou (poppy seed candy), a retainer of Aruheitou, accepted the task of killing Aruheitou's son as it was the lord's command.

Keshitou thought he had no choice but to kill him due to his master's predicament, but although his own son was the same size, his master was of high quality, whereas his own son, though the same Aruheitou candy, was cheap goods worth only one or two mon - as different as snow and ink that bear no resemblance to each other. Though he said it was for loyalty, they all seemed like they would melt away in the south wind - such a pitiful state.

Keshitou beheaded his son while the boy was playing innocently and presented him as a substitute.

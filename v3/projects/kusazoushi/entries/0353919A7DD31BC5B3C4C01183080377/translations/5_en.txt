Little Rakugan, having lost the tea bowl entrusted to him by his lord, resolved to immediately commit seppuku to fulfill his duty. Just then, his partner Hanahorō arrived and tried to persuade him to postpone his suicide for a while. However, his resolve remained firm, and since Hanahorō and Rakugan were inseparable companions, he tried various ways to dissuade him.

Having received a detailed complaint from Yamadono's picture (Rakugan) that Aruheitou was in possession of the tea bowl, the officers disguised themselves as various candy sellers:

Tojin-ame (Chinese-style candy)
Dohei-ame (Dohei candy)
Okota-ame
Amaita-ame (Sweet candy)

They surrounded him in various disguises. When Aruheitou fought desperately, considering this his final stand, the situation became somewhat overwhelming. At that point, Danjuro Senbei appeared from Shibaraku and captured Aruheitou.

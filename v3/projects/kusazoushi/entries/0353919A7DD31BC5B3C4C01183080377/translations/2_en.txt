Preface
I humbly beg your pardon, but I must make an announcement. Last year's new publications were exceptionally well-received by children, for which I am most grateful. Therefore, I believe there might be some novel ideas this time as well, but since my wisdom is limited, I present old tales in the style of kusazōshi wrapped like confections. If you would be so kind as to read this three-volume work that combines everyone's reviews like pine wind with cherry candy and hōrō cakes blooming with black sugar, even if it's a great tumble, I would be as grateful as rice crackers. With these sweet words, I put down my brush.

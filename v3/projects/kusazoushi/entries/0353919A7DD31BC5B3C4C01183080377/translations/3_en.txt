Here is not an oboro manjū (steamed bun), but just a regular manjū - the ninth-generation descendant, known as Kyoto Dry Confections Mountain Lord, who rules over sixty-odd provinces. Even though his meals may be somewhat plain, his parental heart is second to none. There is no one, regardless of social class or gender, who does not respect and admire him, and his lordly dignity is truly awesome.

Dry Confections Mountain Lord loves tea and has entrusted his treasured tea bowl to Rakugan's son, Little Rakugan. "You must take very good care of this tea bowl that your father has treasured," he said.

【Dialogue in illustration - Little Rakugan】
When the time comes,
I'm troubled

【Dialogue in illustration - Big Rakugan】
My son,
how grateful,
it is his lordship's will.
Take good care of it.

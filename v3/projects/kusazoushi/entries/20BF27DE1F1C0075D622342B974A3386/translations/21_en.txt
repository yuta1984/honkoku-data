Though I am an unworthy person, by the direction of the tree leader Tachibana, I serve in the role of tree head, handling not only kyōgen performances but also consultations among the entire troupe, taking care of all matters and even serving as a substitute for the tree leader - for this I am envied. Truly, as the golden saying goes, when one grows old even a qilin becomes inferior to a nag. In my youth I was called "sunrise," receiving warm patronage from each of you. Preceding the morning glory, I bloom at dawn, and my bark is a treasure of all provinces - the finest for colored paper, poem cards, correspondence, and books. On New Year's Day at the first sunrise, I contribute to the auspicious spreading of fans, raising up the virtue of the base paper. I am one whom nobles and commoners alike never discard for even a moment. Thinking there is none superior to me, receiving boundless favor from the world, though accustomed to virtue, [someone seeks] to wither the stock of this blameless paper mulberry.

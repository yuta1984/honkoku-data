Yamashina is quite a tough area (indeed). You there, Lord Mulberry tree, with your lovely tree form, becoming one, putting up unnecessary branches, saying things like "people will be troubled when I wither" - such aloof behavior (oh my). These are already quite arrogant and proud ones - true tengu fly barefoot. Finally, recently sprouting young buds, oh what thick roots the base of this great tree has, as written in the kusazōshi stories. Moreover, female trees are deeply sinful - though it's an old saying, they appear like bodhisattvas on the outside, but inside their hearts are as frightful as within the bell of Dōjōji temple. If you don't correct that wood nature, you'll be excluded from the tree community and might even become a demon lily. Look up and there's blue sky, look down and there are wells. Thinking that you alone receive special favor and there's nothing else is foolish. To become skillful, grow whiskers and emerge from below - that's what skill means. Be stylish so as not to smear mud on the sacred tree of Ōji that has withered away (oh).

"It would be good to attach it," they say, but with Meroga's ulterior motives - how pitiful indeed! To spill all the inside secrets of the tree base, talking about a mere two or three ryō to the great multitude of plant and tree folk - this is not something to be discussed. "Oh my!" Should I call it vulgar or should I call it dirty? This alone is unsuited to the tree's character. If so, it's hard to guarantee whether it's a bit of an old tree or a wild tree. Among your relations there's a pine with deep roots, and this tree is already boastful of its strength.

With such a short upbringing as a tree, it might even break ginkgo branches using Lord Kōzō's rear end. Not limited to plant and tree theater, but in any theater, when love affairs go badly and there are hearts filled with jealousy and envy, everyday life becomes bitter and there's no harmony. Like fish and water that don't mix, the artistic wood-cutting doesn't match. If it were to extend to human emotions on stage, it would trouble the tree base, cause commotion among the audience, and lead to injury.

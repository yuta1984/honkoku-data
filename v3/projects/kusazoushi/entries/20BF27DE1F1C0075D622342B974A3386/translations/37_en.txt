Don't forget in your daily heart the "ridiculous" you said yourself. In the old people's kyōka (comic poem) too: "Though the calf crawls through the window, alas it gets stuck by the tip of its tail." This sentiment, when applied to your circumstances, makes for an ingenious famous poem. Well then, from here on there's nothing particular to say to Lord Kōzō, and without it, the pear tree. Now that it's been heard, whether Jūrokubeye's way of speaking is unreasonable or logical, let Lord Tachibana also listen. First, you who are called an ancient tree leader, make it cheap.

If there are plants and trees, why attach logic to each other, and insist on whatever argument is good - what country could this be? While the other plant and tree folk are enjoying themselves without worry, each putting forth their designated contributions, to insert Nagahiko among them and, relying on evil eloquence, to disturb a whole country - this seems harsh but is actually weak. If that's your resolve, then without letting people know, just leave word at the tree base and if you're going to strike it down, it's up to you - to each one's growing place.

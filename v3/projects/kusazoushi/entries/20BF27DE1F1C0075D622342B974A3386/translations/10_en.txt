It must be sleep-talk. Well, just when he thought he had taken a nap, a wild wind suddenly blew, and white clouds blown down from Mount Koma covered the grove entirely, as if a curtain had been drawn. "How strange," he thought, and observing the scene half in a dream, the spirit of an oak tree appeared first, making the sound of clappers: "clack-clack-clack." Then the wind blew again and cleared the clouds, revealing small grass spirits emerging here and there.

Looking at them, he saw they held yellow flowers and lined up in a row. Though it was still deep in the night, they illuminated the area making it seem like daytime. These must be sulfur grass. Their appearance was truly like a theatrical setup - beside what seemed to be a stage, they had constructed a diagonal path, and along this too, those sulfur grass spirits were lined up without gaps, so Jūroku-bei thought it must be the design of a hanamichi (runway stage).

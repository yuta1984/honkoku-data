Ginkgo (spirit)
<<Margin note: Well, well>> How kind of you, faithful Mulberry-san who keeps promises, walking in the night shadows, how grateful I am. In the height of eggplant flowering season, among all the inferior plants and herbs, if the three trees that have joined hearts act as one, no other trees or plants can match us. Cotton should also come at the appointed time <<Margin note: why>> but is late <<Margin note: indeed>>

At this moment, the hand towel that Chū-Rokubē was wearing flutters and flies up, becoming the spirit of cotton

<<Margin note: What's this>> The two gentlemen have been visible since earlier <<Margin note: not at all>> I was anxious thinking it should be soon <<Margin note: what is>> my heart was restless, but since Jūroku-bei had tied me under his chin and I couldn't come when I wanted to, I was struggling to untie myself, so the appointed time was delayed

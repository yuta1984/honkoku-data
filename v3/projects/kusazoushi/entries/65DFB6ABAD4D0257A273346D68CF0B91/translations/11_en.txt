How wondrous! When Osode made a vow to Atago-san for her thinning hair, it immediately grew back as before. However, since her temples were still thin, she made something called a "bin-sashi" (temple ornament) from whalebone, creating a good fashion and rejoicing in it. Around that time, she employed a woman who had come from the Kamigata region, who was extremely skilled at hairdressing

and later became a professional female hairdresser. The rumor that she attached boar hair was false.

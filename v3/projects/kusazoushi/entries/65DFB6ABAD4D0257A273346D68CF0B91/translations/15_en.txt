Osode's mother has received various marriage proposals, so she asks her daughter for her opinion.

"What shall we do?"
"I'm worried."

"I too have received much care from you, and while I say I'll go along with whatever you decide, as long as Kanda (Yokichi) promises not to take another wife,

I will simply live here and remain single for the rest of my life.

If that is his intention, then I have other thoughts on the matter."

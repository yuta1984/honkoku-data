【Illustrations of Twelve Types of Water Tigers (Kappa)】

Upon examination, the "kawataro" (river child) is a type of water monster and mysterious being. There are several varieties of this creature. Although they exist in the Kanto region, they are extremely rare there, and incidents of harm to humans are also rare. Those found in Bungo Province are very numerous, and many people suffer harm from them. These are also different varieties. Chinese literature does not record such things. The name "suiko" (water tiger) appears in the appendix to "Kei-ki-chu" (valley demons) in the *Honzo Komoku* (Compendium of Materia Medica), but the explanation is unclear.

In China, there are names like "mokukyaku" and "yamaotoko" (mountain men), which may belong to the same category as these creatures.

**Kappa**
Those found in Bungo and Chikugo provinces completely resemble humans, or are similar to monkeys with fine, long hair. They can speak human language well and enjoy sumo wrestling. Like humans, they do not carelessly appear before people. Their ability to conceal their form is not something ordinary supernatural beings can achieve.

The *Shuowen* states: "The wang-liang are spirits of mountains and rivers." According to the description of wang in the *Huainanzi*: "Like a three-year-old child, reddish-black in color, with red eyes, long ears, and beautiful hair."

On the first day of the sixth month of Kyowa 1 (1801), a kappa was caught in nets at Mito Higashihama. Height: over 3 feet 5 inches, weight: 12 kan. Its appearance was as shown in the illustration.

These two illustrations show front and back views.

**Sugawara Daimyojin Sacred Object**
There is a waka poem by Minister Sugawara to ward off harm from water tigers: "Do not forget the ancient arrival from across the sea, Kawatatsu-otoko clan is Tomohara" (according to folk tradition).

Among their kind, those that have lived many years are particularly strong and can enter human homes, taking the form of women or men, enchanting and violating people.

This illustration of a water tiger is said to be from one found in Niigata, Echigo Province. It was sketched during travels to the northern provinces in the autumn of Kansei Kinoe-tora year.

The feet are as shown in the illustration.

Length: 7 inches, five fingers on hands and feet, face like a monkey, fine hair covering the entire body.

This is a true depiction of a water tiger captured at a place called Hida in Bungo Province during the Kan'ei period. When people touch it, the fishy smell on their hands is beyond description. The concave area on top of the head is like a clam shell, about 2 inches deep. Hair hangs down, making this concave area difficult to distinguish. It is said to have four fangs (upper and lower front) and two fish-like teeth on each side.

During the Meiwa period, near the Honjo Bamboo Storehouse, workers captured a strange creature and were about to kill it, but their elder stopped them and sought help. When they asked Master Ota about its identity and described it in detail, Chogen immediately came to examine it. He identified it as a "suiko," commonly called "hakuhaku," and promptly produced this illustration from his pocket. When compared, it matched exactly with no differences. Master Ota Chogen said this was the second time he had seen a living specimen.

In Hyosube Village, Hizen Province, many of these creatures are found. They also harm people. Local people who cross rivers always write the aforementioned poem on bamboo leaves and throw them into the river to avoid harm.

Li Zhiyan's *Donggu Suojian* from the Song Dynasty states: Song's Zhao Xiaozi was once passing by a waterside when he saw a merchant scooping water with his hands. Suddenly, a valley demon extended its hand from the water and tried to grab the man's topknot three times. When Zhao Xiaozi called out, the man replied: "Even if there are valley demons and water monsters, I had previously placed a little realgar in my topknot, so I will not be affected by this disaster." From this, we can see that valley demons are also similar to kappa. Realgar, also called cockscomb stone, repels poisonous insects, mountain demons, and water monsters. Both adults and children should always carry small pieces.

In Goto of Hizen Province, they worship it as a water deity. During poor harvests or droughts, when local people pray, it is said to be effective. Although seen by people, their forms are not uniform. They regularly come to houses to call out friends and enjoy sumo wrestling. When river children commit evil acts, they are not allowed to remain in their dwelling but must go elsewhere and possess people to confess past misdeeds. In this region, there are no foxes or monkeys at all, said to be because the water deity dislikes them. This is exactly like fox possession in other provinces. When people pray to the water deity at such times, the spirit immediately departs. When travelers carry fish, only the eyes of the fish are secretly eaten. When the person returns and looks, not a single eye remains among the many fish.

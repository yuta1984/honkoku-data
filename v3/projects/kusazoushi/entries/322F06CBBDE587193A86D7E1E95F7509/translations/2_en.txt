Preface to "Revenge: A World of Monsters in the Midnight Storm"

When the author Onitake racked his brains and asked a publisher about story ideas,
the publisher replied: "As the common saying goes, 'People want to see scary things.'
This year, please write a volume about the world of monsters."
Therefore, I have compiled three volumes by mixing my own creative ideas with
groundless tales that I heard from neighboring uncles and aunts when I was young,
and I present this work to the publisher. Please consider this collection of monster stories
from this side of Hakone as nothing more than the foolish ideas of a country bumpkin.

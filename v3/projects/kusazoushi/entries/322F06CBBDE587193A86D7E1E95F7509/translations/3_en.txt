Long ago, in a cave called Futatsui-iwa in Sado Province, which was thought to be several thousand jō deep, there lived a monster called Shuban who tormented people, and many yōkai served under him. However, in recent times humans have become clever, and ordinary methods of shape-shifting no longer work effectively. The boss Shuban decided that monsters must devise such terrifying transformations that they would frighten even other monsters. He gathered his disciples and made them practice various forms of shape-shifting, watching over them like observing sumo practice. He would scold them saying "That won't do! This won't work!" - being a monster was indeed a laborious profession.

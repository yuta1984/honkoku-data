Master Hanka said: "It's somewhat of a mad story, but there was a rice merchant named Kinbei in a place called Bunno-machi. He was honest and dutiful in character, devoted himself to his business, never wore silk but worked hard wearing only cotton underwear and loincloth. Though they say a child unlike its parent is a demon child, his son was quite the opposite - so stylish that he looked good even in fancy clothes. He devoted himself mainly to pleasure rather than business. Though the father was a man who wouldn't waste even one mon, because this was his only son, during the cold night when ice formed, the son suddenly caught a cold. Despite seeking all possible medical treatment, he finally departed this world. The father wrung the sleeves of his cotton robe in grief. Then, through an intermediary, his son's familiar courtesan sent word that she wanted to make offerings to the Buddha, along with ceremonial goods. Though he was such a frugal father, there must have been courtesans with whom his son had intimate relations. 'Please accept this small token as a memento,' she said, offering fifty ryo in gold. 'I would also like to serve tea to his friends, but my place is cramped and inconvenient, so I ask for your kind assistance,' and she offered thirty ryo in gold. This is the behavior of a true connoisseur of the pleasure quarters - such stories of refinement exist among young people."

(Dialogue on the right):
"What shall we do? Shall we invite everyone to the island over there?"
"Indeed, the gods of all things - bringing the offerings sent from the courtesan's side"
"We say we were on intimate terms, and are greatly embarrassed by the father's courteous words"
"I am close to no one, I leave everything in your capable hands"

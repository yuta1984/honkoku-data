"Written by Tsūshō, Illustrated by Kiyonaga"
"Published by Okumura Genroku of Tsūshio-chō"

Tsūshō's personal name was Nei, his courtesy name Shigen, his haiku pen name Tachibana Shizuku, family name Ichiba, and common name Kohēji. He lived in Tsūyu-chō. He remained unmarried throughout his life and was like a hermit sage within the city. He enjoyed writing popular fiction and produced several hundred works from the An'ei period through the early Kansei period. His works focused primarily on moral instruction, so people called him "Instructional Tsūshō." He died on the 27th day of the 8th month of Bunka 9 (1812) at age 74. He was buried at Shūgen Temple in Asakusa with the Buddhist name Kakuhō Zenshin.

Torii Kiyonaga's common name was Ichibē. He was a disciple of the master Torii Kiyomasu and a leading artist of recent times. He is also called the founder of Edo nishiki-e (color woodblock prints). As the grandson of Kiyonobu who did not favor painting, he temporarily painted signboards for the three major theaters. His colored prints, illustrated books, and ukiyo-e bijin-ga (beautiful women prints) became popular in the world. It is said he devised a technique for depicting the transparent quality of indigo-dyed katahira (summer kimono) worn by beauties.

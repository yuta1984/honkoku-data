There are women among men, and there are men among women.

At the Asaina Pass in Kamakura, there was a stoneworker named Gohei. He was a heavy drinker and a wastrel who had ruined his family fortune, causing his mother constant worry day and night. Finally, they found him a wife, and he became somewhat more settled, living quietly. However, when invited to a neighborhood banquet, his usual drinking habit emerged. Afterward, he went with four or five others to visit Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine, and upon going up, he immediately vomited at a sundries shop, making the whole gathering filthy. His courtesan companion took off her outer garment to clean up, made him a pillow, and put him to bed, where he slept helplessly until dawn.

While ordinary women think of courtesans and geishas as if they were thieves, there are none among women who would do such things for money. You should consider them as perhaps one in ten thousand.

When he sobered up, he returned home in shame, but having been so cared for by the courtesan at their first meeting, he could not leave things as they were. Fortunately, his mother had gone to relatives for hot spring therapy and was away, so he lied to his wife, sent her back to her family home, sold all the household goods without exception, scraped together four or five ryō, and went for a second visit (ura) to that courtesan. He gradually expressed his gratitude, saying, "Though it's quite humble, please use this as sleepwear," and offered her a kosode. She replied, "You must not get angry with me. I don't see you as the kind of person who would give me this. After all, in this profession, such things happen all the time," and returned the kosode. When he said, "What do you mean now?" and told her honestly all the circumstances, she left the sitting room, returned to her chamber, brought back fifty ryō, and said, "I'm giving this to you, so call back your wife and take good care of your mother. I have no parents, so I envy you." This represents great filial piety toward loving parents.

Tamashin has been enjoying himself lavishly with expenses equivalent to those incurred during river closures. He hears that Hatsune's redemption can be easily arranged through the good offices of a certain lord from a Kamakura estate, with negotiations being handled by a playboy on some day.

Covering his head with a hand towel, he waits for the lanterns of the Ōmon gate to be lit and comes to the front of the Umeya. Looking there, he sees it's temporarily closed with a pile of spirit offerings, geishas flowing in like muddy water, and people carrying in soba noodles with rattling sounds.

Though no one else knows, he alone breaks into a heavy sweat, thinking that even coming at this time, the threshold seems to appear as high as Atago Hill.

The boatman at the moat
doesn't know who this person is
or where he's from,
but judging by his appearance,
he feels at ease with him,
and takes him to one of
the finest establishments
in Naka-no-chō.
Though he has
quite poor judgment
about women
and is inexperienced,
the boatman never dreams
he's an Edo native,
thinking he's a wealthy man
from some rural province.

"He'll probably be
staying for a while,
so please take good care of him,"
he asks his relatives
and connections in advance.
"Naka-no-chō in Edo must seem
cramped and
uncomfortable to you,"
he says, treating him like a country visitor.
Since Tamashin is someone
stepping foot in this district,
the boatman shrewdly
assumes he's a wealthy
country patron,
and from then on treats
the novice as a rural visitor.

At the Umeya, there was no loss for Tamashin. "Leave him be, acting quite impudently," they said. But truly, with the "kon kon" (fox cries/not coming), his spirits were dampened like Nakabashi. When told that Hatsune had a fox customer, it would put a bad mark on their establishment's reputation. First of all, the other courtesans would speak ill of her, and if this matter became known to the public, it would not be a laughing matter - it might interfere with business.

"Could this be the mischief of some spirit from a shrine without a proper deity?" Realizing this, they hurriedly constructed a new shrine.

They requested a hōin (high-ranking Buddhist priest) to perform prayers that no evil would befall them.

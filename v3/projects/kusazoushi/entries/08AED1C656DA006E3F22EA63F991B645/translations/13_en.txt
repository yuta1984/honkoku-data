At the money exchange house there were five or ten gentlemen, and Tamashin scattered money around so carelessly that one would think "surely this much spending wouldn't be proper." If it were fully October, there wouldn't be such extravagance. "Do as you please, master," they said. For the sōbana (tips for all staff), he gave one ryō gold coins each, spending without even a bu coin or any spare money left. While Hatsune wasn't looking, he secretly pocketed five or seven coins at a time from the rice bowl.

He treated others lavishly, made money, and with such a generous spirit becoming fashionable, he felt embarrassed to the point of being first-rate. Even though he was being made a fool of by this rabbit scheme, he didn't think it might be a dream, and feeling quite like a ladies' man, he strutted about with money jingling, showing off to the ladies.

A man called Henjamaya Shinbei from Teppōzu,
though born and raised in Edo,
no one would take him for an Edo native.
His overall appearance and dress
have nothing fashionable about them whatsoever.
He wears a blue-brown cotton haori over
a karasan-stripe kosode, or else
a soot-bamboo colored haori with a mouse-colored
kosode, or hachijō silk, barely managing to dress himself.
He seems to care only about his pipe case
and tobacco pouch. Though his attire
makes him appear timid,
unexpectedly he puts on airs
with great confidence, never saying
anything miserly, and for the first time
heads out from a boat inn at the moat.

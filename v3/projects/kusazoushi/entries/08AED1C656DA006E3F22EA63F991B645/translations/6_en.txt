Hatsune, amid the commotion of her potential redemption for fourteen or fifteen days and being busy, has received no word from Tamashin, who used to visit so frequently. Thinking to send him a letter, she called Kihachi and asked him to help, but no matter how refined a customer may appear, neither the boat inn, tea house, young men, nor households know him. It's quite reasonable that she would call about 180 regular customers tiresome.

【Dialogue】
"Truly ridiculous!"

【Middle Volume】
Tamashin, even when listening to the neighboring child's shamisen practice, thinks, "If I were more worldly-wise, I wouldn't have to suffer like this. It would have been better never to have met her." Now he can't very well tell Hatsune not to contact him, but when he considers redeeming her, it's too big an undertaking. Even if he were to commit love suicide with her, he can't be sure what would happen afterward. Leaving things as they are would be both cowardly and regrettable. Most people are conceited, but he torments himself with endless "what-ifs."

"Even a single box of gold would be precious!"

"Lend it out carefully
so that no harm
comes to it."

【Main text】
The fox official announced his intentions, gathering together many spirits without proper shrines: "This time, an establishment in Yoshiwara called Umeya has newly constructed a shrine. Moreover, the construction is stylish, and every season they offer hot rice, tofu and such in abundance. With their familiar, devoted spirit, they provide this fresh whitebait fish that wriggles about, and plenty of sacred sake too. If we put our hearts into it, we can transfer this to our long faces - good health and long life are guaranteed. However, they have one request: an amateur woman has apparently imitated you all and written a kyōgen play." Hearing this, all the spirits said, "Let's make fun of that person and play around." Though we might call her a detestable creature, if we leave things as they are, Umeya's troubles will quickly return. However, make sure Umeya doesn't realize you're not foxes. If you're not foxes, they'll think building the shrine was pointless, but in exchange, we'll make their business prosper.

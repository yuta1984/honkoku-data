Tamashin, restless and embarrassed in his deliberations, went to talk with someone he trusted. The friend said, "No matter how secretive you try to be, even if there were someone who knew about it, there isn't. I have a good plan. Long ago, Sōjūrō performed a play called 'The Fox's Courtesan Buying,' which was an unexpected great hit. I was eighteen or nineteen at the time—that must be thirty-seven or thirty-eight years ago now. The plot was to drive a wedge between Tora and Jūrō. The rival lovers included Kyō no Jirō, with Tora as a client. They cut off a dog's paws and placed the footprints in Tora's room, intending to harass her by making it seem she had a fox as a client. Recently, Kōraiya also performed 'The Fox's Courtesan Buying'—I believe Sakurada wrote it, but I was away in the Kansai region at the time and didn't see it. Taking advantage of not knowing the details, we could write a play using the fox motif to make her dislike you from the start. That would be good."

"If we do it in this manner, she'll surely be frightened away.

Indeed."

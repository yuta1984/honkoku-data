Tamashin has become deeply acquainted with Hatsune and continues to visit her, but it's always without any expenses, just the usual routine. Under these circumstances, it's tough on those who don't go out for pleasure.

When the brothel manager speaks like that, thinking he's the type who wants everything, and contrary to their expectation that young men would want to take things, during this seasonal festival period, he doesn't make any requests of Tama-san when visiting. This too is quite agreeable.

When even that doesn't work, the tea house proprietor, the brothel manager, and the courtesan - the three of them put on a show of determination, unwilling to reduce their base prices. They reach the point where they'd want to advance him even flower money received from other customers.

Since the master is a traveler on business, it would be fine for him to stay on consecutively for however many days, but considering what the inn might think, they consult about whether it would be better to send him back around tomorrow.

【Dialogue】
"We asked Rihei-san about the next seasonal festival, so what do you think?"

"It should be quite fine."

Tamashin seemed to have made quite a mess of things, but the situation felt ominous, and there was no way to consult even a quack doctor for advice. To avoid being discovered, he wandered around the embankment area, thinking that when evening came, he would go as far as the lattice gate to take a look. As he walked back and forth through the miscanthus fields, Umeya's Kihachi appeared on the road, saying, "Well, setting aside the matter of visiting sometime, thinking of this as some kind of religious offering is quite reasonable, but this place is bad. With wet eyebrows, I fled without even looking back."

Kihachi: "It's me, hey!"

"Tamashin, aren't you wandering around too much? You've been bewitched (literally: had your eyebrows counted). A letter has arrived from Lady Hatsune," and he handed it over. Opening it to read: "The previous correspondence was deceptive. Although you departed, we know neither your lodging nor your name here. At that time, you left persimmon leaves in the drawer. Though it may be presumptuous, if you are in need of money, we can provide any amount you require. In any case, we await your visit. Respectfully." Thus he read.

"A little while ago, Kihachi caught sight of you."

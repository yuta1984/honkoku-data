Tamashin thought he had really made a mess of things, and after about five more drinks, in what seemed to be a dark middle street, the place was bright as ten thousand lanterns with fox-fire. While wearing his kosode, he felt like visiting a pleasure house, and being a heavy drinker, he carried some piping hot rice cakes. When Hatsune came toward him:

"There's no good child here, and without jokes, it's ridiculous to go to such a foolish place, so let's give up on courtesy and just have fun. I too will do tatehiki (lavish entertaining) or whatever, and even if I have to sell myself, I won't give to others or worry about it. If you need money, I won't lend it. Life is a bit difficult, isn't it ridiculous?" Thus Jūrō there, and Katsuhara Genta handle the situation with their understanding.

"Soon I'll open the tsurube soba (well-bucket soba noodles)."

"What a beautiful thing!"

"What should we do now?"

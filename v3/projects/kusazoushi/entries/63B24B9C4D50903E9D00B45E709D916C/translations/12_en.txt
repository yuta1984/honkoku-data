Recently, when someone asked a Chinese mountain doctor who had shaved his head to find acupuncture points for hernia pain, the doctor didn't know where to place the moxa for hernia treatment. Thinking it would be "un-connoisseur-like" to say "I don't know," he pretended to know and said "For hernia, hemorrhoid moxa is good," and applied hemorrhoid moxa. The patient, though thinking "surely not," considers it would be "un-connoisseur-like" to embarrass the doctor here, so he endures the heat and receives about ten applications—this too is being a connoisseur. Is the one applying the moxa also a connoisseur?

In the military treatise called "Twenty-four Scenes," it says "For hot flashes, apply moxa to sanri point," so "There, with my ingenuity, hemorrhoid moxa for back pain. This is hernia logic, it must work."

[Dialogue]
"If this cures it, even hernia becomes connoisseurship"

"It's uncouth, but one does say 'ah, it's hot'"

When connoisseur Chinese doctors meet on the road, one asks "How is it, doctor, how is that matter we discussed?" and the other responds:

"Well, it's a well-known matter, I tried the point method, but something got heated up in the complication, chon, chon, it's just covering up." When the first Chinese doctor replies "That won't do, ten, ten," they part ways. Whether it's Chinese rhyme or Japanese rhyme I don't know, but if this serves the purpose, it's connoisseurship. Even physically, this is called the sleep talk of connoisseurs, and rigid people wouldn't understand it.

Universally, Sachiko has made China into an age of connoisseurs, received various treasures, and returned to the land of connoisseurs - how auspicious this is!

A person called "Daitsū" (great connoisseur) is someone who:

One - likes hasty, superficial learning
Two - carelessly spends two-shu coins
Three - gets used by others first
Four - doesn't go out during day or night
Five - is never popular at any time
Six - pointlessly talks nonsense
Seven - pretends to know everything
Eight - wants to do shameful things
Nine - in this new publication
Ten - was made into a China expert

Come see the great connoisseur's performance!
Come take a good look at the great connoisseur!

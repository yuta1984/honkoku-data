In the world of connoisseurs,
this is called "an era of unlocked doors,"
where all people
become great connoisseurs,
and thieves think
"What's the harm in
living
together?"
They deliberately
leave their
doors wide open,
as if to say
"Take anything you want"—
what an extreme form
of connoisseurship this is.

[To left page]
Even thieves
are clever creatures,
thinking that
stealing from such
stylishly connoisseur households
would be uncouth and boorish,
so the thieves
instead leave money behind
and depart.

[Dialogue]
Hey, wife!
I'm back!
Rejoice!

What? Buy some night-hawk soba!
You thief,
go home!

The dog wants to bark
but barks in a connoisseur way.

Even if I do this
and make fried rice,
no one will notice.

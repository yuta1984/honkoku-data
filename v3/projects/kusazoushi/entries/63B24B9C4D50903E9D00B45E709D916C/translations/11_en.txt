When a husband discovers his wife's lover and enters the house, thinking about where the man might be troubled, he keeps staying outside, and even following the husband to the outside of the sliding door shows connoisseurship. Since the lover being discovered and surprised is ordinary, deliberately coughing from inside the house and making futile sounds is also the way of this world of connoisseurs.

"I hope he doesn't think that because I'm too much of a connoisseur, he's gotten used to it."
"Ah, where shall I remove myself to?"

[Dialogue]
"Ahem, ahem"
"When my husband returns, it's blocked, blocked"

"This isn't a privy that makes fun of people"

The lover is also a connoisseur, and though he says nothing at first, thinking he must give money for his life even if he has to borrow sugar money, or else he wouldn't be a connoisseur. When he borrows money, the lender of sugar is also a great connoisseur, and thinking that taking interest on such money is not connoisseurship, the sugar dealer pays interest to the borrower at a rate of three ryō and one bu—this is outrageous connoisseurship.

[Dialogue]
"First, let me just leave this month's interest payment. The sugar money for the person in question, living and working comes to three ryō, three ryō"

"Taking interest to the borrower—what a clever thing! Putting sugar on the rich man, payment and settlement, eh?"

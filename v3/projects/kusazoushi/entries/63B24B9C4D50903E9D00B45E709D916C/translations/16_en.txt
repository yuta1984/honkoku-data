At that time, there was a spirited connoisseur in Japan called Watōnai Sankan, who heard there was a war in China. Wanting to settle things and show off his prowess, he earnestly pleaded to come over. However, China had become a world of connoisseurs, and with war set aside, it was a world of sightseeing and sophistication, so Watōnai was greatly thrown off and returned to his home country.

The tiger of Senri-ga-take caught a glimpse of Watōnai, but thinking "If I were to appear, it would lead to a fight," the tiger also acted like a connoisseur and pretended not to see him, behaving docilely.

[Watōnai's dialogue]
"This grand performance has become useless. I might as well dedicate it to Daisen mountain."

Is this really what happened? That tiger is Toranoo no Jūshirō, the fellow who says "Ah, there's no challenge at all" and acts disappointed.

[Tiger's dialogue]
"If I were to cause a great disturbance here, it would be like cutting bamboo freely and getting my rear end cut off."

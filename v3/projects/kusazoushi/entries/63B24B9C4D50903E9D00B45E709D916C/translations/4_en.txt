Two or three people who should be the leaders of connoisseurship had an audience with the great king, speaking of various aspects of great connoisseurship, saying that the excellence of their wit was like the beauty of the shores of Shichirigahama. The great king, impressed by the sophistication of the connoisseurs, gave them many treasures and sent them back to neighboring countries. However, since the great king wished to make the Chinese people of this country into connoisseurs, he returned the other people but kept Kōshi (one woman) here alone to have her study the way of connoisseurship.

[Dialogue]
To do such a pitiful thing
is truly unfortunate

Oh, what can one say

With only this much
in the forest,
who will help, they wonder
who will take it away
to the mountains

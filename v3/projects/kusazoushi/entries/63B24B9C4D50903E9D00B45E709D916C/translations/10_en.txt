A certain connoisseur accidentally spat phlegm on a passerby's head while walking down the street. Feeling sorry about it, he apologized profusely, but

The other person, being a great connoisseur, took out a tissue, wiped it with his own hand, and said, "You seem to have quite a phlegm problem," then took out a dose of Seimei-tan phlegm medicine from his pocket, saying, "What kind of connoisseurship is it to give medicine to someone who spat phlegm on you?"

"My phlegm comes in hot phlegm and large phlegm varieties. The phlegm is acting up. This phlegm, sorry, sorry."

"What, you have plenty more, don't you?"

In this world of connoisseurs, where people not only spit phlegm on others' heads but also give them medicine for phlegm, the one who was spat upon, unable to bear the situation, thought to commit seppuku immediately on the spot. However, thinking that would seem like spite toward the other person and thus not connoisseurship, he decided to go home and cut his belly—what extreme connoisseurship! Moreover, his wife, being an even greater connoisseur, had already anticipated such an event and sharpened a sword blade in advance to assist her husband—truly great connoisseurship!

"If you're that perceptive, having a new seppuku ritual tray specially made shows you're still green, still green."

"This is truly an imperceptible item indeed. Hmm, ritual tray, ritual tray."

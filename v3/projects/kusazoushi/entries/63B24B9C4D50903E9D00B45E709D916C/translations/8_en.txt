Truly, this has become
a world of connoisseurs, where society
prospers peacefully,
and even in this world
that exhausts
a thousand
days,
even women
become connoisseurs, styling
their hair with
ornamental pins
in lantern-chignon style and Katsuyama-shimada style, while the
courtesans of the pleasure quarters repeatedly remake themselves into Chinese women,
becoming connoisseur women.

Rather than Japanese-style hair,
let's send someone to get
hair oil from Matsumoto

The comb should be
bent sideways
and inserted,

When women
dress up to
this extent, it's
certainly
good for their husband's
reputation,
they say,
but doing so in the connoisseur
style is
not proper.

Now then,
let's go
to the bathhouse.
When going to
the public bath,
wearing regular geta
is wasteful—
have them carry a bath basket while wearing koma-geta.

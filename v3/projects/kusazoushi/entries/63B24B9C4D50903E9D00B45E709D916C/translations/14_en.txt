A Chinese connoisseur who was learning to recite gidayu performed for people to listen, but since both his voice and musical phrases were poor, it didn't even merit a meal, yet being unable to resist his desire to perform for others, the performer himself would cook rice and tea and invite people to listen to his recitation—this is what connoisseurs do. The friends who come to listen, though they endure listening to the poor joruri performance that lacks skill, may find it painful, but the gidayu of great connoisseurs and refined people is not particularly entertaining.

[Dialogue]
"Finally experiencing such a thing, there's no precedent" / "there's no meal"
[A pun on "ためしがない" (unprecedented) and "茶飯がない" (no meal)]

"I've never heard anything like it, but it seems like a beginner-level tayū performance."

"Gaga, dada, paa, paa, paa, paa"

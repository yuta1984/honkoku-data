Already past the hour of ushi-mitsu (around 2-3 AM), the monsters thought Matahachi had fallen asleep and approached, intending to devour him in one bite.

"I'm ready for you!" he declared, and immediately drew his sword, cutting them down with all his might. The monsters vanished one by one, disappearing without a trace.

"We've encountered a tough opponent - even we monsters are defeated!"

"It's better to flee from such a fellow!"

"Ow, ow! My ears are being torn off! Forgive us, forgive us!"

"You insolent monsters! I'll reduce you all to dust and ashes, every last one of you!"

Thus, Matahachi easily vanquished even such a formidable demon cat, so Kaemon expressed great gratitude, saying "The revenge for my mother's death is entirely thanks to your grace," and entertained him with various hospitalities and feasts, requesting that he take his daughter Oshiga as his wife.

Oshiga rejoiced at becoming the wife of Matahachi, whom she had been longing for, but she remained fearful of the cat-demon's supernatural powers.

Looking up at the sky, he saw the red cat's head dancing about in flames, which he glared down and vanquished. After that, there were no more strange occurrences.

Kaemon was astounded. "The obsessive spirit of a cat is truly a terrifying thing."

The gathering of supernatural beings. A drinking party among trustworthy companions. Looking down upon people is one who holds the rank of blind musician master. When the cat-demon gnaws on the shamisen, an amusing tanuki beats its belly drum. The birth-spirit never forgets to dance even at a hundred years old. As the night deepens, the rokurokubi tells long tales. Ghosts become the flickering out of candles, and yawning mouths split to the ears. The oil-licking sprite clicks its tongue, and when it blows out the lantern, from the pitch darkness emerges the loneliness of the Hour of the Ox. "There it comes! Oh, it's out! What has appeared? Is it the greatly forbidden Kinpira?" Kuwabara, kuwabara, forgive us! Preface by Jippensha Ikku

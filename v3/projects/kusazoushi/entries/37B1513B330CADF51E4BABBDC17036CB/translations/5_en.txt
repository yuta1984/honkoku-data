Takehachi bought the tiger cub and went down to Edo, making his mother happy as well. Since it was such an unusual creature, he showed it to everyone from the landlord to the residents of the tenement house. At first, he treated it like a cat, feeding it regular food. However, since this was a source of income, he took extraordinarily good care of it and raised it carefully. The proverb "to treat something preciously like a tiger cub" began from this time.

There are various ways to be ingenious about things, and Takehachi had the idea to feed it bamboo shoots. When he tried this, the cub ate them with relish. From then on it grew remarkably, so he was greatly pleased and fed it bamboo shoots morning and evening, removing the spicy parts and feeding it until it was time to add the medicinal herb hange.

At this age, I'm seeing one for the first time.

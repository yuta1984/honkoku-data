While Watōnai was staying in Nagasaki for a while with the Chinese people he had brought along, Takehachi also came to Nagasaki. Among the Chinese, there was one who had brought a tiger cub. Takehachi, both by the nature of his trade and his acquisitive character, desired a tiger cub that could "run a thousand ri" as mentioned in an old poem, wondering whether to listen to or tell such stories. This was a matter of negotiating over the verse, but he finally sought connections to approach the Chinese person for this fine item. He tried to bargain down from around two kan, but when the seller shook his head in refusal, he boldly offered three kan. However, since Watōnai had become quite wary of losing money at three kan, he too shook his head in refusal.

Having no choice, when he added another two hundred mon on top, the seller still shook his head in refusal, so after consultation, they asked how about three kan and two hundred mon. Though it seemed inexpensive, tiger cubs are items whose true value cannot be determined. Even for a sideshow, he thought privately that such a price was too low, but suspecting it might just be a cat dyed yellow, he received it with some doubt. He would try raising it first, and the buyer thought this showed good judgment.

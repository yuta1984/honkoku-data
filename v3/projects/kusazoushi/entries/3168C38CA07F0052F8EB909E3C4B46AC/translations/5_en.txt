In the dim moonlit evening twilight, the ubume bird wanders here and there aimlessly, and when it meets a beautiful passerby, it plans to make them hold a stone child, opening its mouth in such a gesture. While standing holding a stone, there came a rustling sound of flapping wings from the shadow of lumber, so wondering what kind of bird's roost it might be, when looking through the moonlight, they saw what appeared to be like Urashima opening the jeweled box - something that looked young yet aged, beautiful yet unpleasant, an emaciated face crawling near the lumber. Seeing this, with hair standing on end in quiet terror, trying to flee desperately, there in the partial shadow of the lumber was a pale-faced man whose mouth was split to his ears, who could not be seen as having two eyes. The ubume bird could not even let out a "gyuu" cry and fled without even seeing the ubume.

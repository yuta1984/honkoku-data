"That's not true," say the uncouth ones who are precious, and monsters who say "I haven't seen it" are precious. Children becoming adults, brides transforming into mothers-in-law - such strange things indeed, yet no one is surprised to hear of them. The morning tofu seller transforms into the evening oil seller, and finally walks about selling monster oil with hearty laughter.

When humans see humans transforming, they don't think it's even like a loofah skin, but from the monsters' perspective, there is nothing more terrifying than this.

Here, the leader of monsters, Three-Eyed Nyudo, has recently retired to a place beyond Hakone, living peacefully, but on a certain day when the weather was pleasantly clear and the spring breeze blew gently, feeling somewhat lonely, he gathered his friends and began telling one hundred tales about humans. The monsters' version of hyakumonogatari is conducted in broad daylight with lanterns lit, just like setting up a ghost story session for children.

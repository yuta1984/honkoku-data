After that, the white fox couple called Kurōsuke nearby and consulted with him: "Since Mori-no-jō's conduct is getting worse and worse, we should disown him." Kurōsuke thought "Perfect!" and said: "Indeed, that seems quite reasonable. I should be the one apologizing, but though you may not yet know it, even the house treasures—the precious jewel and key—have long been pawned, and your treasure storehouse is empty." Upon hearing this, the couple were shocked.
"That detestable son! In his obsession with courtesans, he's even lost the family treasures. There's no excuse for such behavior! He's disowned for seven lifetimes—get out!"

"Since the fault lies with me, I have nothing to say. Kurōsuke, I'll remember this. Farewell to you both, and to Misaki as well."

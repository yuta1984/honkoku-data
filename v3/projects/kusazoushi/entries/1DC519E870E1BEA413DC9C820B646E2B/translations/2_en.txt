Now, the shop clerk Kurōsuke appeared loyal on the surface, but somehow wanted to
drive away Mori-no-jō
and take over this household succession,
making the daughter Misaki bend to his will. He gave various advice and
finally trained Mori-no-jō to become a man of the world
of the current era. "What do you say, young master? Paradise
is right here, nowhere else.
Such a sophisticated place, what wouldn't one
appreciate as a person of status?"
Mori-no-jō, following Kurōsuke's advice,
transformed into a dandy,
styling his hair in the long sideburns of a fashionable townsman,
though a bit old-fashioned, wearing a crimson crepe haori and carrying a sword,
he would go out. From some point, he began frequenting
this pleasure quarter called Nohara,
becoming deeply intimate with
a courtesan in her prime
named Matsu-
saki.
Recently,
he's become a bit short of money,
consulting with
Kurōsuke,
devising various
schemes.
This pleasure quarter
called Nohara
is where wild foxes
deceive people by
transforming into
alluring
courtesans,
bustling day and night,
unparalleled throughout
the country.
Among them,
Matsusaki
yearned for
Mori-no-jō,
turning away
other
customers,
communicating hearts
from dawn to dusk.

"Oh my,
Mori-san is
coming.
Look at that detestable
face of
Kurōsuke-san."

Misaki, having been asked by Mori-no-jō, tried to raise money even by selling her body, but in these times, even fox spirits can rarely get hold of money. She suddenly had an idea and made counterfeit coins using a large basin. Even if this body falls into the hell of incessant suffering, it doesn't matter. It's for her precious, beloved man.
"Gods of all Japan, it's only three hundred ryō. Please forgive me."

Now, Mori-no-jō tried to raise money through the help of his two sworn brothers, but it was quite difficult to obtain. The two felt sorry for making them work so hard while they themselves were just playing around, so they devised various schemes. Since it was summer, when many people gather, they thought to put on a theater performance at the entertainment district, disguise themselves as actors, and make money. The three consulted together, made a signboard, took the surname of their hometown Matsukawa Village, Mori-no-jō changed his name to Matsukawa Tsurushichi, and the brothers became Tanzō and Yonemitsu. When they began their erotic performances at the show tent, the people of Edo being great lovers of spectacle, from the very first day large crowds came to watch and they earned a great deal of money.
"Come, come! The erotic performance by three theater actors begins now!"

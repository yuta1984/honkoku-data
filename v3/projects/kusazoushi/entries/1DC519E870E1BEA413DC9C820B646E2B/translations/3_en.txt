That night, Kurōsuke took Mori-no-jō to the pleasure quarter,
then returned alone, and seeing his chance while the house was empty,
he seized the opportunity to corner Misaki and sweet-talk her:
"Listen here, that foolish master
is infatuated with
that beautiful
woman named Matsusaki
and doesn't even
remember you at all.
And Matsusaki too
is terribly smitten with him.
That's no wonder either.
In front of you he makes
a face like looking at
a cheap mask,
but to Matsusaki he presents
himself as a great lover—
no wonder she falls for him.
Give up on such
an unfaithful man
and submit to me.
If only you
agree,
I'll immediately transform
into quite
the handsome lover."

"Now, now,
Kurōsuke,
to the master's
daughter,
when there's a man
named Mori-no-jō,
that's disgusting talk.
I'll tell
father and mother
about this."

【Lower Section】
"What do I care
if you tell them?
Your getting
angry like that
is also
irresistible.
Come here,
come here."

Mori-
no-jō became
obsessed with
Matsusaki,
frequenting her day and night
until now he's troubled by the cost of her services,
worrying and fretting.
At this point Kurōsuke devised
a scheme: from this
house's inherited
treasures, he stole
a precious jewel
and key,
pawning them for
three hundred ryō.
"Young master,
stay
calm.
We've done it
perfectly.
What of it? A parent's
things belong to their child.
If we're found
out, we'll deal with it
then."

"Please
handle
this
matter well.
I just hope
we don't get
caught
later."

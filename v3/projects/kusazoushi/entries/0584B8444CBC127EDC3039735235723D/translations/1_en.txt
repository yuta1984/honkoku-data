Here there was a man called Ise-ya Tokuzaemon who dealt in sake and commerce. Recently, he had gradually begun to improve his fortune and called two apprentice children from his home province to make rounds of his customers and conduct business daily.

Seeing this, [someone] tried to wake up Tokukichi, saying "I too should go to the bathhouse with Kosuke. Go and observe the situation there."

"Although both Kosuke and Tokukichi are the same [...], Kosuke doesn't take care of his hair at all even though he goes to the bathhouse every day."

When urged to go first, Tokukichi went with his collar and ears completely black, only skilled at dozing off.

[Dialogue in the illustration]
"Ah, I'm sleepy."

"Excuse me, master, shall I go to the bathhouse for a bit and wash myself?"

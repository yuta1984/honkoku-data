Kōsuke thought his prayer would work, and thinking this was good, as he was passing through the Umamichi area, from inside a latticed house, what appeared to be a maid - a very pretty woman - was using a paper fan to sweep out trash with eggplant stems and seeds onto the street. Thinking "She too has fallen for me and deliberately came out to throw away trash," he found her detestable and tried to embrace her, but the woman was startled and shook him off and ran away.

From then on, when Kōsuke tried calling out to women here and there, he was rebuffed everywhere. Since even the landlord's wife of the tenement seemed to be giving him the cold shoulder, he thought "This should work well" and grinned. The lady of such-and-such near Negishi was also half-worn and a bit suspicious, but since the situation seemed like it might become real, he gave up and went to visit a courtesan.

If this were the Shining Genji, this would be the part where he'd say "Naishi no kami, Saisho no kimi, moan for me," but this Narihira isn't the type to compose poetry, so he can complain through humming.

"Kōsuke-san, you've come at a good time. Please watch the house while I'm away."

"This won't work either. Damn, the Jizō's blessing worked too well - I can't get anywhere with anyone."

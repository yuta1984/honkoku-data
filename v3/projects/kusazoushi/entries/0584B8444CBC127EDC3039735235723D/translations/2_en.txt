Now then, the duties of the two servants at Tokuzaemon's place involved making daily rounds to customers, but unlike in the past, nowadays they don't say "How may I serve you?" but simply approach partway, peek around lazily, and that alone suffices for their business.

Kosuke, when told by beautiful neighborhood women or sophisticated young ladies "You're such a good boy, bring us some good sake quickly," and hearing "Good sake may be forgotten, but a good boy..." finds this most delightful and has such an eager disposition to bring things immediately that he normally struts around with his kimono hem tucked up.

Even when leaving the house, once away from the neighborhood he lets his hem down and simply lies sprawled on the verandas of hair-dressing shops here and guard posts there. Finding stories amusing like "that woman over there was uppity" or "that girl here was slovenly," recently his voice has become hoarse as if he'd been eating salted fish.

"The other day, the carpenter's wife from the back alley was sleeping, and though there was only one futon to sleep in, [someone] was sleeping there, and when I went, after drinking five cups of sake, [he] threw me out. Afterwards, how pretentious and terrible!"

"This fellow says outrageous things. Well, go and do your duties, then come back and play."

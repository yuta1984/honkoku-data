But if he were to give a favorable response to just one woman among all the women of this vast Edo and fulfill that love, resentment would rain down on him from all directions. Although each woman showed signs of being swayed by him, he thought that his body wouldn't be able to handle it all. "What a sinful situation this is," he mused, "but I must endure this and first eat nourishing food to build up my strength so that I can satisfy at least one percent of all the women in society." With this resolve, he once again began to favor foods that would boost his vitality.

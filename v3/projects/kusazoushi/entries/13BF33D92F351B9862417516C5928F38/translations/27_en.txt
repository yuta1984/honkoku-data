Now, among the monster companions, they had been searching for pleasure-seekers in various ways for some time, but since human dwellings are unknown to monsters, and for some reason their whereabouts had become unclear, they decided to use tanuki and foxes as messengers, sending them to monster companions throughout the provinces with detailed letters of inquiry.

Fox-sensei, where are you
staying?

You there,
which way
are you
going?

I'm going toward Shinano and will
stay there for four or five days.
I plan to stay at the place of
a medicine peddler I found
through a divine dream revelation
some years ago.

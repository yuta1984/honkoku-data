Ideno entered the bed, and when Mitsudo awakened, the beauty of her expression asking "Master, did you see anything?" was so different from the cat form just witnessed that he could only think they were completely different beings. "No, I saw nothing. Since we're lying together like this in our madness, there's nothing to hide. I'll tell you about my background, so you tell me about yours as well," he coaxed.

"I am not originally human, but the child of a monster called Mikoshi-nyudo. Since I was accidentally born defective as a human, I fortunately spend my time buying courtesans for pleasure. Since you're willing to share your story, I too will speak without concealment. My parent was an old cat called a 'bakeneko' (monster cat) living in Mount Ide. Long ago, she caused harm to others and was eventually killed by a hunter, meeting her end. At that time, I was still very young (literally 'when my claws were not yet hidden'), and from then I gradually matured. Hoping somehow to restore the divided household, I have recently been living on Mount Goten, practicing my arts and deceiving people in this place for my training. If you too have such a background, please gradually learn the arts of transformation and restore your parent's Mikoshi household." However, you must not take this badly.

One time, Oroku and Oyuki were together, playing sugoroku (a board game) for so long that both of them drowsily fell asleep. Though they usually appeared friendly and beautiful when facing each other, deep in their hearts they harbored strong jealousy, and the sight of the two supernatural beings' hair standing on end in conflict was frightening even to the eyes of monsters.

Mikoshi no Suke, witnessing this scene, realized for the first time: "So women are indeed jealous deep in their hearts - I understand this for the first time now. How foolish of me to be so confused."

From this point, he entered the Buddhist path, and secondly, wanting to search for his missing son, he cut off his own black hair, left it as a keepsake for the two women, took religious vows and left home, setting his heart on a pilgrimage through various provinces.

From this time he became Mikoshi Nyudo (Mikoshi the Monk), gained enlightenment about the floating world, and wherever he went, thinking "could this be my child?" he would stretch his neck from behind to peer over and look at people. Because of this, everywhere people feared that "Mikoshi Nyudo (the Peering Monk) has appeared."

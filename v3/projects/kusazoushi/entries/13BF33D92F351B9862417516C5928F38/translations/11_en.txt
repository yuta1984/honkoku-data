Mikoshi Nyudo, certain this was his child, tears welled up in his eyes as he recalled the past, and without watching the performance, he dejectedly returned home. He wanted to wipe away his tears, but his hands were left outside his kimono, so there was nothing he could do - he had to go home.

"Hear ye, hear ye! This time a great monkey has come down, bringing a human child - such a rare thing that we have kept it here and intend to employ it for your entertainment. Since a simple performance would provide little amusement, we shall have it perform various stage arts together with others. First, let the dancing begin!

Honorable spectators, please return to beneath the eaves of the old shrine, and we humbly beseech you for your favorable reviews."

Mitsudo played until around the hour of the Dog (around 8 PM), went to bed after the hour of the Rat (after midnight), and as usual engaged in various conversations before falling asleep. However, Ideno quietly got up, confirmed that Mitsudo was breathing with his hand on his nose, and went outside to the Hyobu quarters. Mitsudo pretended to be asleep and secretly peeked, only to see that what had been a beautiful face until now revealed the terrifying form of an old cat, crunching and eating nearby shrimp shells and all. He was greatly shocked by this sight.

[Mitsudo's dialogue]
How frightening! ...one must learn... I'll pretend to know nothing and question her about it.

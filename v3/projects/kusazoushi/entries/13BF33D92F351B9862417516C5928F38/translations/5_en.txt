Now then, Mikooshi-no-suke went to visit Oyuki the previous night, and they revealed their deepest feelings to each other. What happened after that, being monster affairs, who knows - but they became intimate lovers, and from then on he visited her nightly for pleasure. This snow woman was not always pure white as one might think. When snow was not falling, she appeared quite human-like, and her seductive skills put even Hamura-ya to shame.

Mikooshi came again tonight and spent the night as usual.

Meanwhile, Oroku found it strange that her husband went out somewhere every night and returned in the morning. While her body stayed home to watch the house, she secretly sent only her head to follow him. When she witnessed this scene, she was shocked, thinking "So that's what's going on!" but kept it to herself and returned home. Being just a head, she could move about freely.

[Dialogue between Mikooshi-no-suke and the snow woman, much faded]
"Without anyone to stop us, there must be other such pleasures too. Come closer to me... let's indulge in a little play."

Monsters from China who came to browse this pleasure quarter, and eccentric monsters, set out singing seductive songs.

"What a beautiful sight! Well then, China, let's go browse the Hyakki Yagyo (Night Parade of One Hundred Demons) district for a while, shall we?"

【Lantern leading the courtesan's dialogue】
"Miss Oroku, don't stretch yourself out too much. Your hairpin is dangerous in this crowd."

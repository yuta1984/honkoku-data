According to the recent talk among the gods, the master of Tsurugaoka has come up with an idea to make pleasure-seekers throughout the provinces practice frugality and ensure their descendants' prosperity. In that case, the parishioners of the God of Poverty would wither away. Since both Buddhist prelates and the pleasure business are essentially the same thing, I've come to consult with you.

There is a pact called the Twenty-Five Heavenly Beings for this. Taking advantage of the gods' absence during this tenth month when they depart for Izumo, what do you think of a scheme to make people spend money hastily and suddenly impoverish them?

Indeed, indeed, this is something we agreed upon earlier. Since we're already approaching the tenth month, we must devise some plan or it won't work.

This is quite a clever idea! An unprecedented scheme in recent years - we fifty heavenly beings are like beautiful faces seen in profile.

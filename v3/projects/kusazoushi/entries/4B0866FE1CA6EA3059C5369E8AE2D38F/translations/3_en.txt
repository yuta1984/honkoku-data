One time, Ten-ten made a pilgrimage to Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine, and while drinking at a two-ken teahouse, he became drunk and collapsed in a doze. In his dream, he saw three deities having a consultation.

The deity of Hachiman Shrine spoke: "Listen, honored deities, since the tenth month is approaching and before the gathering of gods at Izumo Grand Shrine, I wish to have a preliminary discussion with each of you about a certain matter. In recent years, the parishioners throughout the provinces have become excessively extravagant, and their attitudes toward matchmaking between men and women have become self-indulgent. While this behavior is uniform throughout the world, the situation in Kamakura is particularly dissolute. This year, I would like to suspend matchmaking activities and focus on eliminating extravagance. What do you all think about this?"

The Great Avatar of Hakone replied: "Indeed, indeed, just as you say. In recent years, regarding matchmaking, the parishioners arbitrarily form unions here and there without waiting for guidance from us, making our matchmaking efforts completely pointless." The Great Deity of Mishima said: "The concerns of both deities are entirely reasonable. Since most misconduct ultimately stems from extravagance, firmly suppressing luxury and encouraging frugal living should be the primary divine protection for prosperity. Let us discuss this thoroughly at the gathering at Izumo Grand Shrine."

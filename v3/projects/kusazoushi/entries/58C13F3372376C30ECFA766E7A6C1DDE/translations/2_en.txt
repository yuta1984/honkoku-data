Preface

There exists a creature called Mikoshi-nyūdō. How long its neck is! It raises its head and trembles at the magnificent view of heaven seen upside down, and lowers its head to strike the depths of hell's landscape. In the evening when it sleeps, it uses fire watchtowers as pillows, and in the morning when it wakes, it rinses its mouth at the well in Kōjimachi. When this is compressed, it becomes like a lantern; when folded, it becomes a small booklet, which is twisted about and given to booksellers.

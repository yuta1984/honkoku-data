If only he would, and if he suddenly came now, what would she say? She became entranced waiting all evening, but naturally Momotaro didn't come. On the man's side too, thinking that Oroku would come sneaking over tonight, he prepared sake and food and waited (in the same way).

With both of them wanting to wait and eager to meet and see each other soon, their single-minded desire made their necks stretch longer and longer until they bumped into each other midway.

♪Whether it's Momotaro or Oroku, you can only tell by looking. With only necks, they can't even embrace. Their necks shed a thousand tears in every way.

Since Momotaro's neck had grown long through the gray heron's intervention, he became a mikoshi-nyudo (a neck-stretching specter). When he met his father Momon-jii after a long time, Momon-jii was overjoyed and said, "Ever since my first borrowing song, you and your mother have suffered through the years, which was pitiful. Now that I see my old age approaching, I shall pass on my hereditary position to you." He taught him all the secrets of shape-shifting, and [Momotaro's lineage] prospered for ages to come.

Now the mikoshi-nyudo received complete instruction in the arts of transformation and became increasingly useful to his fellows. In particular, he became the chief leader of this group and devoted himself entirely to the way of shape-shifting. Monsters from various provinces gradually flocked to him and became mikoshi's disciples. Recently, both fields and mountains were filled with a fishy wind, and it seemed that various monsters of all kinds were gathering together.

♪Speaking of the chief master of monsters - children always tend to favor him, so it's fine not to worry about the children. But when you threaten those who are too clever for their own good, they'll expose you completely, so you'd better be careful. After all, there's nothing more frightening than humans!

The rokurokubi, who was the only daughter of the three-eyed nyudo (monk spirit), had long been betrothed to the three-eyed nyudo. While traveling on the road to visit the three-eyed one, she encountered Kintaro's son Kinpira, and thinking he was an ordinary human, tried to frighten him.

When she tried to scare him, Kinpira, who had long been fond of monsters, would purposely go out around the hour of the ox (2-3 AM) every night to wander through eerie fields and mountains. Just when he encountered the rokurokubi, thinking "this one too would be perfect," he dragged her long neck like a rabbit and took her home.

Even my master is now stalking monsters - what a terribly wicked idea!

Sakata no Kinpira, retainer of Minamoto no Raiko, has been collecting monsters since recently.

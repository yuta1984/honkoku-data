Here there was a being called Mitsume Nyudo (Three-Eyed Priest). His daughter Oroku had been prone to fits and convulsions since childhood, and every time she was startled or surprised by something, she would pull her neck in. Eventually, her neck became permanently retracted. Born with the nature of a rokurokubi but with a habit of retracting her neck, it wouldn't extend at all and remained completely withdrawn. Her father, Mitsume Nyudo, was greatly distressed by this. After all, if his daughter could become a proper rokurokubi, she could be a real monster, but with a neck that won't extend, she's just an ordinary human. Even if they wanted to find her a husband, no good man would come for such an imperfect daughter, and even if they wanted to marry her off...

This daughter was beautiful and had no other faults, so there weren't entirely no suitors, but still she was a troublesome case. If only this neck could be made to extend with money, he would buy new medicines to cure her. He consulted many doctors and exhausted all medical treatments, but no results were to be seen.

How to Make Molded Dishes

Kamaboko: Make a paste from sea bream, flounder and similar fish, add Chinese yam and a little salt,
mix well by grinding. For the yellow parts, add egg yolk, for the white
Tamagawa parts, add crushed black sesame and mix. Lay a cloth in the steamer, first put yellow
to make a good thickness, then white, then yellow, then white, as described
above, cover with cloth and steam. Cut from the end.

Same This is also the same method as Tamagawa. However, for the light green parts,
Haru-gasumi mix ground abalone liver.
Steaming method same as Tamagawa
But don't add sesame to the white parts.

Same This also uses the same ingredients as Tamagawa. However, only white
Sumi-nagashi with sagara-me wrapped inside and steamed.
After cooling, cut from the end and a pattern will appear
as shown in the diagram.

Generally, for Hina tiered boxes, both fish and vegetables should borrow red and blue colors to make them beautifully white. The method for applying red and blue colors is given at the end - refer to it. Other unnamed molded dishes, or various shapes made with fish cake, etc., are numerous and constitute the specifications for Hina tiered boxes. For molded dishes and prepared items not written in the menu, many specifications are provided later. Too much elaborate work in ordinary tiered boxes is rather poor. One should use good judgment.

Individual lunch boxes - Hinoki split baskets: For festivals, memorial services and other large gatherings, use hinoki split basket flowing style.

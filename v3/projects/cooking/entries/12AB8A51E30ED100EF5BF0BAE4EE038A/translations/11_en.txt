Someone said: "Since the food for going to lower residences doesn't differ much from regular meal plans, you should prepare and bring them in cut-and-stored containers rather than tiered boxes."

This is certainly reasonable, but even at lower residences, there are often retired parents or important people living there permanently. On such occasions, since these are items to be shown to those people as well, they should be arranged properly in tiered boxes so as not to appear unsightly when brought. Also, when invited to someone's villa or bringing them as greetings, the above method is appropriate. Even at one's own villa, if elders or parents are staying there, it is good practice to include foods that those people particularly enjoy.

Generally, when invited to a lower residence or going for a meal, first observe the seasonal fruits, flowers, and vegetables available in their garden or tea plantation, and use them appropriately as garnishes for soups or accompaniments to fish dishes when the time is right. If there are rare flowers or vegetables, do not handle them carelessly. Appreciate and request them, using them prominently. Follow this principle for other items as well.

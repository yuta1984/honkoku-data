○Ranuka (orchid flowers): Soak old broad beans in water, and when they have swollen, drain them. Make one cut with a small knife on the head of each broad bean and deep-fry in sesame oil. They will open in four directions like flowers, resembling orchid blossoms.

○Yamabuki (mountain rose): Hard-boil eggs, take only the yolks, and strain them through a grater. This is also used as an ingredient for egg rice.

○Kuzu suitor (kudzu dumplings): Mix kudzu powder with a little glutinous rice flour and white sugar, knead with hot water. Boil water and drop portions of this mixture into it, lift out with a mesh ladle, cool, and use in various dishes. Depending on the dish, it's also good to color with red dye.

I omitted the method for fixing red dye in the previous section, so I'll explain it here.
Generally, there are various methods people devise for fixing red dye, and depending on the ingredients, the color will set quite well naturally. It sets without problems on kudzu, Chinese yam, rice flour, high-quality wheat flour, etc. However, when dissolving red dye, it must be well kneaded and dissolved on lacquerware, otherwise lumps will form and cause foaming when washed.

For small amounts of decorative red coloring, mixing kudzu powder or glutinous rice flour with the red dye will also make the color set sufficiently.

However, coloring food with red dye is something done for Girls' Day celebration boxes and such, and is not much favored for ordinary packed meals or inkstone lid presentations, so it would be a pointless endeavor that brings no credit.

○Furi-imo (whisked yam) is for clear soup. The method is the same as whisked egg - whether for hot water preparation or clear soup, grate Chinese yam well in a mortar and pour it into the boiling broth, then quickly whisk with a tea bowl.

○Nasu no tauni (Chinese-style eggplant): Take medium eggplants with skin on, make vertical knife cuts from the top

Turnip Dengaku
Cut turnips to dengaku size, skewer them and grill. Brush with soy sauce once and grill until not burnt, apply a little oil and spread miso paste on top. The appearance is the same as tofu dengaku, but otherwise it is a warm dish. If you don't brush with soy sauce once, it won't cook properly. Without applying soy sauce, even if it burns on the outside, the fire won't penetrate to the inside.

Kashi-fu Yaki (Grilled Sweet Wheat Gluten)
Boil kashi-fu well and remove the skin. Press and crush it, add grated ice, strain through a water bag, put in water and stir. It will become properly sticky. If you grind too much, it becomes too sticky and spoils, so don't over-grind. From this point, grill it like regular fu-yaki. For seasoning, Japanese pepper, miso, and hemp seeds are good.

Nishi Soup (Whelk Soup)
Pound grilled miso to make the soup base, pound whelks (sea snails) to break them up and add them in.

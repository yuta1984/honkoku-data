it is rare. When grilled, the scales are admired for their beauty. The scales
are large and the flavor is like cod. When salted, it becomes even more
similar to cod.

　　　Fried Dengaku
Cut tofu to dengaku size and fry in oil. Boil in hot water
to remove the oil, skewer it and place over fire,
until the excess moisture evaporates, then pour kudzu sauce mixed with
mustard over it.

　　　Daikon Light Pickles
Remove the leaves from daikon, wash, and pickle immediately.
For one hundred daikon, use one shō of salt, apply weight strongly so that
water rises within two to three days. It will be ready after forty days have passed. After
that, there is no need to apply weight. Select daikon that are quite thick
and without blemishes, pickle before the winter solstice
and use at New Year. It's good to lay fresh straw
one layer at a time. The color develops and the aroma deepens.

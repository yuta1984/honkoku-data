Grind hamo (pike conger eel) into a paste, add a little potato, prepare the fish as usual,
make it slightly soft, and adjust the seasoning with grilled salt.
White color is considered best. Put it in earthenware, without using
oil, and grill with a cedar magemono (bent wood container) as a lid.

Sugar Fu (Wheat Gluten)
Add sugar and a little pure white tofu to wheat flour, knead with sweet
sake, flatten it, cut into walnut-sized pieces, wrap them round,
and deep-fry in oil.

Vinegar Pickle
Cut fresh small fish into small pieces, boil vinegar and add salt,
then pickle immediately. It must be done with live fish,
otherwise it will be no good.

Millet Wrap
Soak glutinous millet, wrap in wheat gluten, tie the opening with straw leaves
like a pot, and season with soy sauce.

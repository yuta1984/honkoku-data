Make a base with kelp dashi and miso sauce, separately boil
pickled plums at a ratio of six plums for ten guests, extract the sour taste,
add this boiled liquid to the miso, and cook surimi fish
of any kind in the usual manner. When making the dashi,
add a little squeezed ginger juice.

　　　Oki-namasu (Offshore Raw Fish Salad)
Cut bonito into appropriate sizes and apply "hi-ate" (fire treatment - this means
burning straw and briefly exposing the fish to fire until the color changes,
then dipping it in water). Prepare it like sashimi,
apply salt, grill the head and middle parts well, chop finely,
combine with the above-mentioned fish meat, knead well with salt water,
wash with salt water and use. Any fish will
do, but bonito is best to start with.

　　　Nankin-jiru (Nanking Soup)
Beat eggs into miso soup, and when it comes to a boil,
add tofu skin that has been fried in oil.

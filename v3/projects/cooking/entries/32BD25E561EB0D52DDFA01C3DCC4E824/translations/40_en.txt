It's delicious. From the sixth boil, prepare the broth.
Make it by simmering with the finest soy sauce and bonito stock.
By the time the broth is ready, the udon will be well cooked.

　　　Kishi-men (Flat Noodles)
Knead udon flour without salt, knead by foot as usual,
roll thin, cut into strips about 5 bu wide like tanzaku paper strips, and
adjust with the broth. If you use too much dusting flour,
the broth becomes thick. It's better to use less dusting flour
and prepare with more broth. Add sake and soy sauce to the broth, making it
slightly sweet. It's best to add bonito shaved in large flakes. Beat the udon
into the broth, cook and set aside. Cut scallions to about 2 sun length, add plenty,
cook, then add the udon and serve.
Udon kneaded with bonito mixed in is also interesting.

　　　Egg Dengaku
Steam only egg whites in a cedar box, cut
like dengaku tofu, skewer on green bamboo sticks, and serve with wasabi miso

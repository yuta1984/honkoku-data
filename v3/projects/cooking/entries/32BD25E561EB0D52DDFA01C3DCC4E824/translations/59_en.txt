Season with soy sauce and keep warm, then add to the aforementioned pot. Dissolve mustard and pour over before serving.

Tsuto-dofu (Straw Bundle Tofu)
Add kudzu to tofu to make it firm, wrap in cloth, then wrap in straw bundles and steam. Remove the straw wrapping and simmer in fresh soy sauce. Cut into rounds.

Soba-kiri (Cut Buckwheat Noodles)
Shinano flour should be kneaded with hot water. Flour produced in warm regions should be kneaded with cold water. Flour from during the doyo period is good; flour after doyo has passed is poor. At such times, it is good to add three eggs or one block of tofu per sho of flour. When making soba for many people for the evening meal, one must begin kneading from morning. Since it becomes poor when dried out, in the evening boil mochi in water, let that water cool well, ensure there are no lumps of mochi remaining, and knead and roll the dough with this.

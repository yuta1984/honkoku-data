Jōshin Pickles
Wash daikon radish well and dry it thoroughly until there is no moisture.
Sift rice bran and add two gō of salt per one shō of bran《marginal note: moisture is｜not good》for pickling.
Regarding the pickling method, daikon that is too thick is not good. Ordinary
daikon that is slightly thin is best. The weight should be sufficiently heavy,
which is good. Pickle during daikon season and use around two to three months later.
It's good to leave it for a long time before using. When opening the container,
remove the liquid on top, take out the pickled vegetables, place the weight back as
before, and pour the original salt brine back in.
It's good to use from around two to three months until about June. Besides daikon, anything can be pickled.

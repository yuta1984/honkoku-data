Steamed and Roasted
Take a whole sea bream, wrap it in water-soaked paper, insert a bamboo tube into its mouth, coat the entire fish well with red clay, and place it under a large pot to cook. Pour soy sauce through the bamboo tube while roasting. Judge the doneness by smelling the soy sauce aroma coming from the bamboo tube. When the clay cracks from the back, it can be removed along with the scales. Use without additional salt.

Ice Tofu
Cut one block of tofu into eight pieces, arrange them in a basket, pour boiling water over them, leave outside overnight exposed to the cold air. The next morning, cook the frozen pieces in hot water until soft, and when they float to the surface, remove them, press lightly, arrange in the basket again, and dry daily. Add cracked gardenia seeds to the hot water as an insect repellent. It's best if it freezes during the coldest part of the night in winter. Evening is not good.

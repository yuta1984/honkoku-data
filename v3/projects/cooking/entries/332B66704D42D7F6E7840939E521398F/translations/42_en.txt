Cool them and rub and wash well. Change the water frequently,
and they will become increasingly white and beautiful. The broth is the same as for cut wheat. Only good kudzu will work for this; 
various oral traditions exist for this.

Yam noodles: Grate mountain yam finely, take six parts glutinous
rice flour and four parts regular rice flour, pound them finely,
knead them with the mountain yam when ready, make small balls
and roll them out like making cut wheat. For boiling,
they are ready when they float to the surface after cooking. The broth is also the same as cut wheat.

Suisen (water lily): Dissolve kudzu flour in water. The proper consistency is when
a drop placed on the fingernail holds its round shape. Then put it in a

suisen pot to a good thickness and place it over hot water.
When the color changes and it hardens, put the pot into
boiling water. When it's cooked, lift it out and transfer to cold water.
When cooled sufficiently, cut it. The broth is also
the same as cut wheat. It is bad to put it in hot water too quickly.

Suiton (dumpling soup): Also knead kudzu flour with water, knead well
together, roll it out with bamboo or wood to a width of
two to three bu and length of three sun, or cut it thin. Add
dashi to miso and boil, top with chives or anything else.
However, it's good to blanch in hot water first. Done this way,
serve it mixed with eggs, clear it with udon broth,
or serve with sansho pepper sauce on a plate.

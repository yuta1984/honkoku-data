Pound it well and when it forms a good ball, make it very beautiful
with no cracks or fissures and roll it well, put it in a container
with a dampened cloth as a lid so that wind does not enter
Place it and take out one at a time to knead. For boiling, taste
and see. For broth, use clear broth or sauce miso. Pepper and plum are good.

Egg noodles: Six parts glutinous rice, four parts regular rice, make into good flour
and sift through silk many times, when ready
knead with water and wrap black sugar inside, roll into
kumquat-sized balls and boil. Broth same as udon.
However, for rice preparation, soak in water for a short time then immediately lift out
put in a bucket and press down evenly. 
If too quick, the flour is coarse and heavy; if soaked too long,
the flour gets wet and sticks together, making it impossible to sift.

Cut wheat: Salt ratio and kneading method, everything same as udon.
For broth, use clear broth or sauce miso with mustard sauce. Boil.

Kudzu noodles: First dissolve a little kudzu in water and heat it
to the temperature of rice cooking water, transfer to a bucket and
let it cool, then knead flour with it. The proper consistency is when you lift and
drop it, it becomes thread-like without breaking. Too quick
to drop or breaking easily is bad. The opening (jōgo)
should be wide enough for a finger to enter. A large bowl is good. Thick
or thin depends on the skill of the jōgo user. The water in the pot
should be boiled well. When the noodles change color while cooking,
scoop them up with a water bag and put them in water.

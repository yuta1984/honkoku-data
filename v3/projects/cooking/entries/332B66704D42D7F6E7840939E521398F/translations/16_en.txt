Good. There are oral traditions about this.
Wasabi miso vinegar: grate wasabi, add miso,
　　　grind well and thin with vinegar
Ginger miso vinegar: same as above
White vinegar: add tofu to mustard, season with salt,
　　　and thin with vinegar. For white dressed salads, do not add vinegar but grind well
Shimofuri (frost treatment): cut tai (sea bream), put in hot water then immediately
　　　cool in cold water. "Shiramete" means the same thing.
　　　Also "yugaku" means to briefly boil anything
"Dropping shadow": adding a little tamari
　　　to clear soup
Muddy: freshly pressed sake lees are always good; muddy sake is bad

Tai kakiiri: roast salt until good, leaving some salt,
　　　put fish in the heated pot, add enough aged sake to cover the fish,
　　　when it bubbles up vigorously, add third-grade white (soy sauce), adjust salt and taste, then serve.

Tai korai: sprinkle a little salt in the pot, add tai as is,
　　　add white water to aged sake, add enough to cover the fish,
　　　cook until the alcohol evaporates, add rice cooking water, drop in shadow (color)

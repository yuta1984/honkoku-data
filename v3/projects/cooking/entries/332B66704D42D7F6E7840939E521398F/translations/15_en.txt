Drip miso: add 3 sho 5 go of water to 1 sho of miso, simmer until about 3 sho remains, then put in bag and strain
Simmered extract: add bonito to fresh drip, simmer and strain
Stock: shave good quality bonito, for 1 sho add 1 sho 5 go of water, simmer and taste for proper sweetness, remove when good - overcooking is bad. First and second extractions can also be simmered and used
Irizake (seasoned sake): to 1 sho bonito add 15-20 dried plums, 2 sho aged sake, a little water and a little tamari, simmer down to 1 sho and strain, let cool. Some people also use 2 sho sake with 1 sho water, simmered down to 2 sho
Stock sake: add a little salt to bonito, simmer once or twice with new sake, strain and let cool
Vegetarian stock: dried gourd strips, kelp (can be added roasted), dried smartweed, glutinous rice (put in bag and boil), dried turnip, dried daikon - combine from these ingredients as desired
Vegetarian irizake: cut tofu into small cubes, grill and add chopped dried plums, dried turnip etc., simmer with aged sake. Also good to add just the essence to sake alone

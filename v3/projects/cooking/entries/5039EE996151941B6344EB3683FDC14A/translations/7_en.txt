　　　　How to make vinegar
1　For one to (about 18 liters) of rice, use two shō (about 3.6 liters) of water and three shō of kōji. Wash the rice
　　two or three times and soak in about three shō of water. Use that
　　water for brewing. Soak for five or six days,
　　then transfer directly from the pot. Place kōji in layers
　　and press down firmly. Place pot lids
　　on top and add water. Wrap the opening so air can
　　escape, and seal around the edges with paste.
　　Whether using buckets or jars,
　　keep warm by wrapping with straw mats

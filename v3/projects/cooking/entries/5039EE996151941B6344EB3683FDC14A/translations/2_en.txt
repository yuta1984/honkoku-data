　　Regarding sake with black soybeans
1　Add three shō of sake to one shō of black soybeans and let stand for fourteen days
　　Wash these black beans well so they have no earthiness,
　　roast them lightly before adding. The degree of roasting should be
　　just before they burn. Until the skin of the black beans
　　cracks slightly.
1　After soaking in sake for fourteen days, remove the black beans,
　　strain the sake well and set aside. According to [unclear text]'s account,
　　it was done this way. There is nothing else to teach beyond this.

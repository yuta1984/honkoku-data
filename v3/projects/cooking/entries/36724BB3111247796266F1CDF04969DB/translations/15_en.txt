According to tradition, egg dressing is two-thirds egg yolk and one-third miso. Poppy seed dressing is half poppy seeds and half miso. Crumbled tofu becomes vulgar if overcooked in broth. The tofu should be boiled in hot water, set aside and crumbled, then scooped in little by little before serving. Teika-style simmering is good from late autumn to early winter. Fish should be scored to the bone. Add three parts aged sake to seven parts water, simmer it down like nuta stew, separately parboil sea bream and add it with appropriate amounts of salt. Ground sansho pepper or mustard are also good. This is a dish from ancient times.

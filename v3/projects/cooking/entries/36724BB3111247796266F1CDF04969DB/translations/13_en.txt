○Water Shellfish 《Side note: abalone | green yuzu》
According to tradition, water shellfish is a dish for the hot season of the sixth month. Remove the shellfish from the shell, take off the ear, wrap in buckwheat flour and leave for about one hour, then wash well, cut and put in salt water, then transfer to fresh water. However, the abalone must be very fresh and alive. With dead shellfish, the water becomes cloudy and dirty. ○Summer jellied dish (kōri) should have well-balanced soy sauce broth, using seven cups of water with half portion of kanten (agar), cook carp well and transfer to a bowl. ○Washed carp is cut irregularly. ○For grated yam dish, grate the yam beforehand and mix with broth, then thin it before serving and pour over the top. ○Cherry blossom soup uses only bonito flesh, finely chopped, with sake poured over and strained into the soup, with shiso and water pepper cut to this size and added raw. Chestnuts are thinly sliced into dice. ○Egg binding involves placing ingredients in a tea bowl, pouring beaten egg on top, steaming in a bamboo steamer, then cooling as is. ○Beaten shellfish are thoroughly pounded with daikon radish from above and below, then thinly sliced and arranged in small mounds.

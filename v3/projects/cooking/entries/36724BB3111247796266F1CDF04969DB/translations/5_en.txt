According to tradition, for kaiseki cuisine and such, regarding seasoning of fish, fowl, vegetables, and everything else, for example, using rustic ingredients expresses the spirit called wabi-mono suki (refined rusticity). The cooking method takes pride in good flavor. Therefore, shitsuhoku (simple, austere cuisine) differs from ordinary cooking - even if ingredients are scarce or inadequate, flavor takes precedence over dishes with complete ingredients. Miso, vinegar, and soy sauce go without saying, but especially for cooking sake and salt, one should use the finest sake. One should distinguish between light drinkers and heavy drinkers when using mirin, sake, shochu, etc. ○For sea bream sashimi, the usual thin diagonal cuts are not interesting. Cut thickly into squares, or randomly cut, or cut into large flat pieces and serve in small quantities. Adding chestnuts and ginger is not good - serving lots of chestnuts alone is interesting. ○For vinegar, use sweet, strong vinegars like mannen-su or nakauwo-su. ○For grilled shells, use either crucian carp or mullet. ○For carp with roe, fine cutting is not interesting. It should be flat-cut with roe attached. ○For green dressing, around New Year use greens for color and grind in Japanese pepper. ○For white dressing, separate only egg whites and steam in a box. Or use boiled eggs, take the whites directly and cut randomly. ○For duck julienne, take large pieces of meat, quickly simmer in sake and soy sauce, then tear finely and dress. Pheasant

torn meat is the same. ○For herring roe, soak well and wash, then immerse in sake for a day - black sesame dressing is good. If for drinking appetizers, mustard miso dressing is good. ○For duck simmered dishes, generally for simmered fowl, first roughly simmer the meat portions and remove. Then fry only the fatty skin well, adjust with soy sauce, add vegetables, simmer thoroughly with the fatty skin, and add the fowl just before serving. ○Hanpen is half fish paste, half mountain yam, well ground and mixed, formed into rounds and boiled. ○For whitebait and small bird simmered dish, pound the small birds, quickly fry in sake and soy sauce, and scatter on top. ○For shell-grilled, break eggs, mix yolk and white well, put half in shell-grilling pan, add well-cooked abalone, arrowhead, wood ear mushrooms, then pour more egg on top and cook. Remove when the top egg is lightly cooked. It cooks well from the steam below and binds together. ○Light snow egg means taking it with a round ladle about six-tenths square and boiling. For simmered salad, put various ingredients together, bring to boil and stir. Put agar in as-washed. It dissolves when cooked. ○Egg yolk and light snow egg are made with only whites or yolks. ○Yaki-hitashi means simmering in sake for about half a day. Wrap fish in kelp and simmer. Tie the kelp roll with dried pine needles and simmer. When serving, show the tied part on top. For late-night meals, this can be omitted.

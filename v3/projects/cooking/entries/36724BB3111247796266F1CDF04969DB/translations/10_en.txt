Dried cod simmered dish follows tradition. Cut to good size and soak in water overnight to completely remove salt. Then simmer for about one hour in sake only with bonito flakes added. Afterward, add soy sauce to adjust the seasoning. For sagarame seaweed, also simmer for about two and a half hours with bonito flakes, sake, and salt. However, for formal banquets (shitsuhoku), unlike tea ceremony, sake is the primary focus, so this should be understood.

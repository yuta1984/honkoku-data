▲Keri (Grey-headed Lapwing)
This is called parent keri, appearing in April
and May. In August,
young keri appear in large numbers. This bird is unknown
to most people. When naturally available at the shop,
they sell it calling it "true keri," but
it's different from true keri.

▲Mountain keri
This is a rare thing, so the season when it appears is
unknown; it appears naturally sometimes.

▲Black-backed bunting (sekuro-hōjiro)
This makes soup for four to five people. As stir-fried bird,
it serves up to three to four people. Also, when there are
no grilled birds in summer, it's also
used as grilled bird. It serves five people. This bird from late
March to April is called water-drinking bunting,

and this black-backed bunting appears. Used from April
through May, June, July, and August.

▲Star parent bunting
This has different coloring, but parent bunting is
the same as black-backed. When birds age,
they become black-backed. The taste is also the same.
When young bunting appears, it's from May. Young bunting
is exceptionally small. Called gourd
bunting. For cooking, both parent
and young bunting have good flavor. Young
bunting as a dish serves two to three people.

▲Midogoi
This is not as good as true bunting. It's something most
people don't know. When bought at shops,
they sell it saying it's a young true bunting.
The bird's size is like young bunting.

There should be accompanying earthenware cups. Up to the御四方 and 御三方, they should be combined and served during the zōni. When serving zōni with foot-beating, the triple-entry earthenware cups can be changed as many times as needed. They should be held in hand and drawn. The accompanying earthenware cups for御四方 and 御三方 should place large-medium earthenware cups beside the zōni. However, if it is the same sitting room, even with foot-beating, it should be done in the same manner.

▲Regarding Sake Vessels (Chōshi)
During the formal three-献, seven-five course, or banquet intervals, white-painted single-spout sake vessels are used. From the first献's zōni onward, golden double-spout sake vessels are used. Wrapping the spout in butterfly shape is not to hide one spout. It is for celebratory purposes. Even so, in the imperial court, the era of wrapping is rare.

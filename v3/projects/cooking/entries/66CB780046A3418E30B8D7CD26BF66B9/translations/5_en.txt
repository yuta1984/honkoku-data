▲About the Four Seasons of Mount Sumeru
It originated from Kunitokotachi-no-Mikoto
and concerns eggs. When heaven and earth opened,
there first existed the mountain of a hundred virtues. This one
is named Mount Sumeru, with water outside
having no boundaries. Below is wind with
no end. Mount Sumeru is divided into four
parts named east, west, south, and north. The
three countries of India, China, and Japan are all in the south.
There are two mountains in each of the four directions. In the east, two:
Great Dragon Mountain and Tiger Mouth Mountain. In the west, one:
Kyu Mountain. In the south, two: Elephant Nose Mountain and Horse
Head Mountain. In the north, two: Lion Mountain and Qilin
Mountain. In the center is Omintatsu
Ra Mountain, which is the main mountain. Mount Sumeru has four
seasons in its four directions. Though the four seasons accumulate
and years pass and time goes by, the four seasons
remain unchanged. This represents the three bodies of Law, Reward, and Response.

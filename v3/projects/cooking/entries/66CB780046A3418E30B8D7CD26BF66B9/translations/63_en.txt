　For kamaboko preparation, it is bad to mix with sake or broth.
　When preparing slowly, extend with water. It is also bad to add salt
　and grind beforehand. Like with scraped sea bream, when setting and grilling,
　grind well and mix with salt. Grill as is. When kamaboko is grilled and becomes
　crumbly, it is because salt was mixed in beforehand.
▲For squid kamaboko, grind sea bream well and add squid horns to make it thin enough

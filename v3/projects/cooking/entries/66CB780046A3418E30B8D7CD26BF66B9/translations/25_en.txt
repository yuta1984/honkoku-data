For braised bird, it serves thirteen to fourteen people.
"White belly" refers to young true wild geese that have no mottled pattern. These are more valuable than those with mottled patterns. These birds also come in various sizes, and some are larger than those with mottled patterns.
Wild geese develop fat starting from early September, depending on the bird. Some birds do not develop fat. It also depends on where the birds come from.
Migrating birds are thin and tasteless, so one bird serves three fewer people.
▲Wild goose (karigane)
There is no difference from true wild geese. The rim around the eyes is yellow. When used for cooking, it is the same as true wild geese. However, because the bird is smaller,

it differs from true wild geese by about one duck. When made into soup, it serves about eleven to twelve people. When used as braised bird, it serves eight to nine people. These birds are not found locally; they come little by little from Owari and Edo. The fat content is the same as true wild geese.
▲True bean goose (hishikui)
This is a large bird among wild geese. When used as a substitute for duck, one large bean goose equals three small true ducks. Small bean geese can equal two and a half ducks. For soups, there can be large and small birds, but generally they serve twenty-four to twenty-five people, and as roasted birds, eighteen to nineteen people. The fat is good when it builds up well in March and April. From migration through winter until February, there is no fat at all.

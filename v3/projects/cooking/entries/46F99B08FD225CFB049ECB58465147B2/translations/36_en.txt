Addendum:
The records of Lord Daien-an Fumai Sōnō's tea gatherings span from Bunka 3 to Bunka 14, 
10th month, with approximately 117 gatherings in total. Although there were various types of 
gatherings—irregular meetings, moon-viewing, snow-viewing, flower-viewing, dawn, morning, noon, dusk, and evening gatherings—only three or four gatherings are presented here for reference.
Generally, tea gathering records are as numerous as grains of sand on the beach, and it would be difficult to record all the various families' gathering records up to the present Meiji era, so we cease including records from the Bunsei period onward.
Additionally, there are records of Rikyū's gatherings written down by Nanbō Sōkei, but these are also not included.
Kobori Enshū's gathering records include the Kan'ei Hundred Gatherings and Shōhō Hundred Gatherings, and Katagiri Sekishū's gathering records comprise three volumes covering from Keian 4 to Kanbun 12, 10th month. However, since these only include tea utensil listings without meal descriptions, they are not included here.
However, we obtained records of the Katagiri family's tea gathering meal menus from Kanbun 3, 10th month to Kanbun 4, 3rd month, totaling fifty-one gatherings, from which seven gatherings are excerpted and added.　　　　　　Year 36, 11th month

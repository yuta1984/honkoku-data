Grate Japanese yam and mix in one grated raw chestnut. Make it soft and transfer to a pot. When warming, it will not separate. If heated too strongly, the stickiness becomes too strong and undesirable. Heat it gently.

　　Quick-cooked Plum
Take large, unblemished fresh plums and put them in sake cups. When cooking rice, before the water is absorbed, float the cups in the pot. After the rice is cooked, remove the cups, discard the hot water, leave the sticky texture as is, sprinkle with white sugar and use. When you want to increase the number of plums, put them in a bowl, making sure the plums do not rise above the rim of the bowl. Cool well before using.

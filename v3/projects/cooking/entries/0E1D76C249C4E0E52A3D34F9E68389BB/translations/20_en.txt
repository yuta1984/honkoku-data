Chestnut, carrot, Chinese yam, plus burdock root, shiitake mushrooms, ginkgo nuts, and wheat gluten - season these eight ingredients with flavor. Drain the tofu well, add a little wheat flour, wrap the eight ingredients mentioned above, and deep-fry in oil. Season kombu dashi with soy sauce to taste, thicken lightly with kudzu starch, and serve with grated wasabi.

　　Oyster Rice
Simmer oysters in bonito dashi with light soy sauce. Place in a tea bowl, pour the broth underneath, cook rice thoroughly and serve over the oysters, cover with a lid and serve. Note that only the tea bowl is placed on the tray. It's fine to serve it transferred to another dish.

　　Beta-jiru (Yuzu Peel Soup)
Cut only yuzu citrus peel into very fine julienne strips, boil well and soak in water. When needed, prepare two days in advance. Make plenty. Use in miso soup. For clear soup, prepare with bonito dashi and soy sauce - it's good to have plenty.

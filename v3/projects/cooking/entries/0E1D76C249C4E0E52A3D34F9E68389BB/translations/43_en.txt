Abe Tofu
Drain water from tofu, add sake and soy sauce little by little. Place tofu in a pot about eight bu thick and pan-fry. When bubbles form on top and then subside, the bottom will start to burn, so remove from heat, scrape off the burnt parts, cut into appropriate sizes, and serve flat.

Bean Leaves
Wash bean leaves, dry them on persimmon paper, rub them well when dried, and sift through a sieve for storage. When needed, place in a sieve and immerse in boiling water. Do not cover when boiling, as this prevents the color from fading. Use in rice dishes and dressed foods.

Blue Tea Clear Soup
Pound only the innards of fresh shellfish and grind well, adjust with bonito stock to make broth, and add the aforementioned innards. It should be beautifully blue-green like aodori, ladled in appropriate portions. The garnish is ground tea.

Then remove the origami fold from the tray and place the chopsticks on top of the origami fold. The server takes the tray away, and after that, clam soup is served. This tray has no chopsticks - use the previous chopsticks. The pepper is also needed at this time.

　　Shimeji Eggs
Crack the eggs and separate the yolks from the whites. Wrap paper around a brush handle for about 2-3 sun (inches), tie it with hemp thread and roll it. Put only the egg whites inside this, boil in hot water, remove the paper, and cut into pieces about 4-5 bu each. Mix the yolks with soy sauce, oil a copper ladle, put the yolk mixture in a round shape about one sun in diameter and cook. Before it hardens, attach the aforementioned egg whites to the handle. When it hardens, remove from the ladle.

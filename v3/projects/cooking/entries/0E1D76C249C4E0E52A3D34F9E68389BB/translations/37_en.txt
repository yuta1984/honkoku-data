Soak herring in water for five to six days, then wash and remove the skin and bones thoroughly. For fifty herring, add three cups of koji and place under a weight. Discard the water that rises to the surface, then cut and use together with the koji. It is good to pickle with daikon radish, water dropwort, mitsuba (Japanese parsley), and similar vegetables.

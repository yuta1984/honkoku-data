Cut octopus legs quite thinly, put in boiling water and immediately remove. Chop daikon radish, rub with salt and squeeze out moisture. Dress with sesame vinegar. More sesame is better. Do not overcook the octopus.

　　Eggplant Tempura
Remove the stem from unblemished eggplants and wash whole. Simmer in fresh soy sauce. When well-cooked through to the center, simmer again with thin soy sauce and irisake (seasoned cooking sake). Top with miso. Wasabi, ginger, or sesame varieties are good for the miso.

　　Chilled Hot Tofu
Make kuzu sauce as usual, softening with soy sauce, then chill. For tofu, use chilled crumbly tofu, soak in water, and transfer to serving dishes. Pour the kuzu sauce over and add mustard. Good during hot weather.

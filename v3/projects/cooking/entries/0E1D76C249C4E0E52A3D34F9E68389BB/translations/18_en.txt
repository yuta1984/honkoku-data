Onokoro Island
Use only egg whites from fifteen eggs per serving. Put them into freshly cut green bamboo, tie the opening tightly with bamboo skin, hold the bamboo vertically and shake it up and down from morning until noon. Around noon, round objects will form inside the bamboo. Prepare clear soup broth beforehand, add these round objects and simmer well. Water shield makes a good accompaniment. The egg feels as if it dissolves in the mouth. If serving multiple people, prepare each portion separately in the same manner.

　　Quick-Cooked Skewer Shells
Without removing the shells, split bamboo and boil them. Bring to one boil, then leave the hot water as is and let cool in the pot. Prepare in the evening, and by the following morning they will be tender and ready to use. Use plenty of water. The shells must not emerge above the water surface. Any shells that rise above the water will remain hard.

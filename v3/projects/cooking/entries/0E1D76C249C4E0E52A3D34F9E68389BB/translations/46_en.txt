Fry them. Discard the bitter liquid that emerges, add soy sauce and stir-fry, then pour yuzu vinegar over it.

Hanging Roast
Remove the gills and entrails from fresh sea bream, leaving the scales intact. Apply salt and cover with paper. Bend a copper wire mesh like a boat shape and set up pillar-like supports resembling fire chopsticks at the four corners, positioning it about two sun (approximately 6cm) above the fire. Place the fish face-up and pile charcoal around the sides of the mesh to build a fire for roasting. Beat eggs, add soy sauce, and gradually pour this mixture into the fish's belly. When it solidifies, add more and continue roasting. Continue this process until the belly is full, then shred the meat, pour soy sauce over it, and serve.

Eel Soup
Cut green onions into five-bu pieces, remove bones from eel and cut into five-bu cross-sections, then make into miso soup.

over them when ready to serve.

　　Shrimp Tataki
Boil spiny lobster, finely pound only the meat, add plenty of soy sauce
and add a little sake, then simmer.

　　Mock Arabesque Pattern
Crack eggs and mix roughly, add shiitake mushrooms,
place in a cedar box and steam. If even a little egg
gets into the water, it will puff up and become unusable. If the eggs are not mixed
well, the pattern will not form. Season with salt if desired. Use as
sashikomi appetizer.

　　Nara Greens Rice
Grind greens and cook rice with that juice. Crack roasted chestnuts
and add them. There is nothing special about the way to cook the rice. Salt may also be added.

　　Tea Seed Miso
Chop tea flower buds and add to white miso, then pound.

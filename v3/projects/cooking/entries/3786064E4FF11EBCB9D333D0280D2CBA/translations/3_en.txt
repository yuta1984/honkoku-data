They served sweets (sweet bean jelly cut and arranged on a cut-glass dish) and brought tea brewed in a teapot. Soon the serving women came (the number of serving women may vary depending on the occasion, but counting today, there were four in total: two young women aged fifteen-sixteen and eighteen-nineteen, and two older women around thirty and thirty-four to thirty-five years old) and asked, "Would you like to take a bath? It's available now, how about it?" When the guests said "Very well," they brought out yukatas according to the number of people (cotton yukatas with vertical stripes and kasuri patterns woven on white fabric). The guests undressed, changed clothes, and each went to the bathroom (the bathroom was one ken square, with a wooden floor area of three shaku by one ken in front. The bath was a box about three shaku by four shaku. On the left side were two shelves for placing the yukatas after undressing. At the right corner, in front of the wooden floor area, was a water basin for washing hands. The basin was a copy of Dutch pottery by Dōhachi. There was a Berlin blue and white jar and small buckets beside it. To reach this bathroom, one turned right from the corridor on the north side of the main reception room, went a little way to find stairs, descended them, went about three ken northward, and the bathroom was on the right side).

After finishing the bath and waiting for a while, following the announcement that the room preparations were complete, going west for about three or four ken, there was a corridor about three shaku wide. After walking about two ken along the corridor, there was a curtain made of thin silk. Passing through the curtain (the curtain had banana plants painted in ink), there was another corridor three shaku wide (this corridor was made by cutting boards into squares of about one shaku and constructing it like stone monuments). Going about two ken westward along the corridor, there was a room of about six tatami mats nearby (this was also a room for serving Chinese cuisine, built in Chinese style. The shoji were fitted panels, with Mino paper on all four sides and thin silk lining the interior). Passing by this room and turning north, after going about two ken more, there was something like a bridge. Passing that as well, one reached the inner reception room, which was the main hall for serving Chinese cuisine.

Five or six potted plants and trees were arranged there. To reach this open platform, one would go past the six-tatami room that had been overlooked and passed by, where there was a small corridor to the east, and upon exiting through a cut-out opening, one would reach the platform. This opening also had the usual curtain hanging. At this cut-out opening, a pair of wooden clogs in what could be called Qing dynasty style could be seen (these clogs were not items that came from the Qing dynasty, but were likely made long ago by Yamamoto Shōzaemon, who had them custom-made at Rokumonya, copying that style. They were probably arranged through the services of Kagihan, Tamagawa Sanji, and others).

The seat mats were two shaku and eight sun square with borders attached, laid diagonally like bricks. On top of the mats, a red cotton cloth about two ken by nine shaku was spread, and there was a round black lacquered table. On the table, glass cups in turmeric yellow with flower patterns, glass plates, and so forth were arranged around the four sides according to the number of guests, with chopsticks provided. The paper chopstick wraps were made by folding glue-paper and marking the character for "longevity" (寿) in red on top. In the center of the table, mint liqueur and hōmei-shu (medicinal sake) were placed in glass bottles. There was sugar in cut-glass covered containers, and several pairs of chopsticks stood in cut-glass chopstick holders.

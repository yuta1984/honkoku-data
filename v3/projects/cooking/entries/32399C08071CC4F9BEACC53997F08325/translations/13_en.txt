Generally, on long days cook for about one and a half hours, on short days about two and a half hours.
Test by writing characters with bamboo chopsticks in the pot, and when those characters no longer disappear, that is the right moment to remove from heat and pour into a lacquered box. Leave to cool as is, and after one night it will set completely. This is called supreme quality kneaded sweet bean jelly.
Also, for lower grade sweet bean jelly, do not use rock sugar and reduce the regular sugar as well.

○Method for Oboro Sweet Bean Jelly (Hazy Sweet Bean Jelly)
Boil white cowpeas well, put a miso strainer in water, and strain the cowpeas so the flesh falls to the bottom and the skins remain on top. Wash that flesh, remove the clear liquid on top, put in a cloth bag and squeeze out the moisture until it becomes crumbly.
(This is called strained powder; when sugar is added, it is called bean paste)
Mix about three parts of stretched rice with this, add plenty of sugar and mix until smooth, lay cloth in a steamer and steam well, then cool and cut as desired for use.

○Method for Bean Paste
Red adzuki beans - 1 go, processed into smooth bean paste and set aside
White sugar - 80 monme  
Water - 1 go
Golden thread candy - a little (this is so the bean paste does not change even after several days. This method is described later)

Add about five or six drops, mix well, and gradually reduce over high heat.
While boiling, never stop stirring, not even for a moment. When you see it has gradually reduced, test the sugar by crushing it - when it becomes viscous and draws threads like silk, this means the sugar has been thoroughly cooked and matured. At this point, drain the water that has accumulated at the bottom of the pot into a separate vessel, then add a large amount of additional sugar on top, and afterward cook slowly over low heat. When the moisture has completely dried and it becomes quite dry, use this as a guide to transfer it to another vessel, sprinkle sanbon-jiro sugar over it, mix well, and store it away.

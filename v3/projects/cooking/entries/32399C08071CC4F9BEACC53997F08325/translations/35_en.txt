Alum powder
Red azuki bean powder
Phellodendron bark powder
Grind these three ingredients into fine powder and wrap in silk, moisten with water and lightly tap onto the paper where you wish to apply it. Grind ink thickly and write anything, then float it on water from above. Using chopstick tips, gently press from the edge of the paper - only the written ink will float on the water surface while the paper sinks to the bottom. Also, if you place other dry paper over the floating characters, they will transfer very well onto that paper.

○Method for characters to appear when white paper is heated over fire
Write any characters with fine sake and let them dry well. Then when heated over fire, the characters will appear exactly as written.

○Method for only the characters to naturally burn through when white paper is set on fire
Take the white ash called "aku" that forms on top of charcoal fire, put it in an inkstone and grind ink. Write anything with this ink and dry it well over fire. When fire is applied to where the characters are, only the characters will burn through, creating something like carved openings.

○Method for characters to appear when white paper is put in water
Dissolve alum in water and write anything, then dry it well - it will be completely invisible. When this is floated in water, the characters will appear in white.

Take out what has been boiled, then roast black sesame seeds, mix with udon
flour, add a little sake and water, knead into
a smooth batter, coat the daikon with it, and deep-fry
in sesame oil. It can be used for anything.

27. How to make agedashi daikon (deep-fried daikon in broth)
This is exactly the same as above with no changes. However,
the cutting should be done a bit smaller. Deep-fry in sesame oil,
immediately pour soy sauce over it, place a little red pepper or grated
daikon on top, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

28. How to make yamabuki-arai daikon (yamabuki-washed daikon)
Take winter-pickled fragrant daikon vegetables, roughly peel
the skin all around, cut thinly into rounds, soak in water, knead
with hands, change the water four or five times and knead it out, then the color
becomes beautiful, turning the color of yamabuki flowers. However,
if it becomes too watery, it's not good. Then grate
wasabi and serve with irizake - this makes an excellent dish.
It's also good for namasu or sashimi, depending on how it's cut.

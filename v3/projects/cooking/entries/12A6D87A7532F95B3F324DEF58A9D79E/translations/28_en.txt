Combine them together, whether directly or in a bowl, put this in, and scatter pickled plum flower daikon on top before serving. Pour the sauce carefully so that neither the julienned daikon nor the flower shapes get disturbed. For this sauce, add a little white sugar to soy sauce and mix well before pouring.

【Recipe 49】Steamed Daikon Method
This method uses dried daikon strips that now come from Owari Province.

Wash these once in hot water, chop finely, put a little sesame oil in a pot, add the daikon, then take salted sardines, salted mackerel, or meguro fish, cut them into thin strips, wash once well with water, boil once with sake, immediately remove and mix into the finely chopped daikon. Close the pot lid tightly, steam-cook it, take it out, add squeezed ginger juice and serve in a bowl. The flavor is excellent. For vegetarian preparation, use roasted chestnuts, ginkgo nuts, and konjac, cut into julienne or thin strips, season them and add. Other ingredients...

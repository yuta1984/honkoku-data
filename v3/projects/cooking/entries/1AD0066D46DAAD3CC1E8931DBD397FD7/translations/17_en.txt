First boil the loach and set aside, then directly add bonito dashi and
miso to that broth, adding sake and soy sauce. Red miso is best. Seasonings are
shaved burdock root, shiitake mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, fried tofu, ginkgo nuts,
and other seasonal ingredients like turnip greens, water dropwort, mitsuba, konnyaku—anything
with abundant seasonings is the specialty. Sansho pepper in the mouth is good.

Snow-white eggs　Method: Take only egg whites in abundance, add a little
ground fish paste, a little sake and salt, thin with water dashi, mix well, and
whip with a tea whisk until foamy, then scoop with a ladle and serve cooked.

Alternatively, with egg whites only as above, whip with tea whisk until well
foamed, then pour in well-seasoned dashi and scoop out
after one boil. 〽Hidden ginger, wasabi, pepper and similar seasonings are good. Since this soup
requires very careful timing, the host should give notice to the guests. 《Because the foam disappears as time passes》

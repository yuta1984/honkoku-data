【First Tier】
Fish meat need not be sea bream;
anything is fine made into flat cuts
and lightly
dusted with salt○Also
if you don't have an omelet pan,
use oil in
an ordinary pan and fry○
Now prepare the rice properly
and mix well with
the above seasonings,
transfer to an attractive bowl
and gently press from above
before serving
The seasonings should suit
the occasion
ーーーーー
Steamed custard cup
　or steamed bowl
　　　　either way

Duck　sliced
Ginkgo nuts　fresh shellfish
Ginkgo nuts　shimeji mushrooms
Wood ear mushrooms
　　　Dried sansho pepper

【Second Tier】
On top of that, layer water pepper or tree
buds and similar greens

Also arrange the above prepared fish on top,
wrap together with bamboo bark
and press for a while,
then as a rolled dish, with the bark,
cut to a good size and
remove the bamboo bark before serving
○Also with Asakusa nori seaweed or kelp
do the same as above,
press and cut as is before serving
In all cases, the pressing and salt
levels are most important; for
kelp and hijiki seaweed, that salt level
is good
ーーーーー
Egg white custard
　or steamed bowl
　　　　either way

The method and seasonings are
the same as steamed custard cup
First grind the fish meat well,
add a little kudzu starch
and mix with dashi soy sauce
to the right proportion

【Third Tier】
It's also good pickled; other fish

meat of any kind, done
the same way and pickled,
will maintain whiteness and
unchanged flavor
○For three-flavor vinegar and nanban vinegar,
use the finest vinegar
Good vinegar will dissolve and break down
all fish bones,
so examine the vinegar carefully
Even bitterling fish
pickled overnight in good vinegar
can be eaten bones and all
ーーーーー
Duck egg white

The method: mix duck meat with
a little fish meat, grind well,
thin with egg white and sake,
soften with water,
portion appropriately in teacups
and steam; also good to
prepare seasonings, wrap and steam

【Fourth Tier】
Kumquats　Persimmons【continued from previous page】
　　　　　Carrots【continued from previous page】

green vegetables that are
in season at the time
○For vinegar: plain vinegar, three-flavor vinegar,
two-flavor vinegar, wasabi vinegar, or
mix a little miso and soy sauce,
thin with vinegar and pour over—
this is also very good

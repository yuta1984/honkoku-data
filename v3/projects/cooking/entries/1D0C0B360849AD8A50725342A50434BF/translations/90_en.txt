○Same, embraced egg steaming
Wash the inside of the belly
of a very large sea cucumber very well,
make a temporary box from cedar boards
to fit one sea cucumber, place it face up,
crack two or three eggs and beat
with chopsticks two or three times, then pour
directly into the sea cucumber's belly,
ensuring it doesn't spill out, and steam.
Take out the steamed result
and cut from the end, use in large flat dishes,
sweet bowls, clear soups, tea bowl dishes,
and similar preparations.

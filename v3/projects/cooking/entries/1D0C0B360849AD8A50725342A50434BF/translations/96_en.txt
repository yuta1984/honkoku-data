○Kuruma Shrimp Stir-fried and Extracted
Remove shell while raw, deep-fry in sesame
oil, serve with wasabi
soy sauce or grated daikon with soy sauce.

○Same, Whole Deep-fried
Take medium-sized shrimp without removing the head,
deep-fry whole while raw.
Excellent for side dishes, combination platters, drinking accompaniments.
However, shrimp that are too large
are not good. Medium-sized ones
should be fried with shell intact.

the tail tip, cut from the back
without cutting completely through,

○Same, Tied Shrimp
Similarly, remove shell while raw, leaving only the tail tip,
split vertically in two without cutting completely apart,
then tie together.

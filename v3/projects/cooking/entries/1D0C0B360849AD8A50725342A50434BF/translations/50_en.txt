○Millet-steamed Sea Bream
First, wash millet well and soak it in water. Then take a sea bream of about 7-8 sun in length, wash it with water, cut it open from the back, and remove the bones. Mix a little salt with the prepared millet, stuff it inside the fish, and steam it.
Wasabi, ginger, Japanese pepper, black pepper, green onion, Asakusa nori seaweed, red pepper, perilla, grated yuzu
Using these condiments, prepare a spicy dashi soy sauce with good seasoning and serve. Note that barley-steamed fish or karamushi can be prepared in the same manner.

○Haya-wakasa (Quick Wakasa-style)
Take a small sea bream of about 5-6 sun, keep the scales intact, open it from the belly, insert the knife through both sides of the backbone, wash it many times, then sprinkle 1 go of salt (or 2-3 go for sea bream over 1 shaku in length) thoroughly inside and outside. Place it face-up and let it sit for a while. Then place an appropriate weight on it and leave it for some time. After that, take it out, wash it with water, thoroughly remove the moisture, and grill it. At that time, sprinkle sake while grilling. This can also be done with lotus sea bream.

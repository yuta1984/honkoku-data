○Same, chicken-style fritters (kei-chin)
Take what has been well pounded as before,
season lightly with soy sauce,
squeeze well with a cloth,
then mix a little wheat flour with beaten
egg, combine with the pounded
fish meat, wood ear mushrooms, and ginkgo nuts
all together, take portions of appropriate size
and deep-fry in sesame oil.
Shaved burdock root, split scallions—
using these as garnish in a clear
soup is most excellent.

○Same, steamed in tea bowl (chawan-mushi)
Take fresh cod with very white
color, well salt-cured [illegible portion]
cut small, lightly season with thin soy sauce,
then with
　Ice konjac　Wood ear mushrooms
or
　Dried sea cucumber　Ginkgo nuts
　Wood ear mushrooms　Scallions cut in half-inch pieces
and other very lightly seasoned ingredients
together, steam in a tea bowl
as usual and serve. This greatly
pleases sake drinkers.

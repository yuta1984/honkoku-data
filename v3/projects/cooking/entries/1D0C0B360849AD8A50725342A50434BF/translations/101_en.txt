○The same / Tsuke-yaki (basted grilling)
This too, skewer the shellfish as before
and grill well from both front and back,
then baste with sansho soy sauce or
kinome soy sauce (wood bud soy sauce).

○The same / Kimi-ae (egg yolk dressing)
Boil in hot water to extract the meat and
season lightly with soy sauce. Then
take only the yolks from
hard-boiled eggs and put them in
a mortar, add a little salt, a little sugar,
and a little miso, grind well, and
dilute to the right consistency with
sake or salt for the dressing.
Adding pepper powder is also good.

○The same / Wara-ni (straw cooking)
Regardless of the size of the clams,
blanch them and extract the meat,
then crack eggs and add
a little soy sauce and dried bonito flakes

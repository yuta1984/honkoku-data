should be used. Also, normally bones are sometimes
grilled together, but if processed as described above,
small bones will not stick
in the mouth and the taste is also good.

　　○Same fish - Rō-yaki (Wax grilling)

As before, regardless of fish size,
fillet into three pieces,
remove the belly bones, wrap around
skewers, first grill with
shira-yaki (plain grilling), then beat eggs and pour over
like tsuke-yaki (glazed grilling) and grill.
Distant fire is best.
When using for tori-zakana (appetizers), apply
a little salt to the flesh before grilling.
Can also be used for confection bowls,
clear soups, etc.

　　○Namasu-modoki (Mock vinegared salad)

For this too, regardless of fish size,
fillet into three pieces as before,
scrape away the belly bones
and cut into thin strips like threads

　　Wood ear mushrooms
　　Cucumber
　　Daikon radish 《Peel into hexagonal shape, slice and layer》
Arrange all three items together
in small bowls, combine nanba-su (nanba vinegar) with squeezed
ginger juice and pool it at the
bottom before serving. Also,
mixing a little miso into the
vinegar mixture as written above is also good.
When cucumber is not available, mitsuba (Japanese parsley)
or seri (water dropwort) stems may be used instead.

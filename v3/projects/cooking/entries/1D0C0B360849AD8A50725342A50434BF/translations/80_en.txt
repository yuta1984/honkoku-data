○ Same with leek mixture
Take what has been quickly simmered as usual, remove the tentacle tips, cut to appropriate size, wipe off the soy sauce with a cloth, and fry in sesame oil. Then finely chop leeks from the root end, grind well in a mortar, mix with miso, warm over charcoal fire, and serve mixed together. It is good with julienned ginger and such.

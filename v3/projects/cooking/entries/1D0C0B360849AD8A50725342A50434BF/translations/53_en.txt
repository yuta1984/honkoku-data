With these types of ingredients, use miso-based soup or thin clear broth, either is fine. The garnish should be chosen according to what is appropriate at the time.

○Same Clear Soup - Coin Cuts
For this preparation, take a medium-sized pike conger, remove the dorsal fin, and roughly chop from the edge. However, it is good to leave a little skin uncut so that three or four pieces remain connected.
Season with red miso or clear broth, and serve garnished with split scallions, shaved burdock root and similar ingredients. Choose the garnish as appropriate.

○Same Preparation
Deep-fry pike conger cut as described above to make into a clear soup. This makes an excellent dish. Prepare as a simmered dish in this manner.
Grated daikon radish, soy sauce, wasabi, scallions - other ingredients are the same as the previous simmered dish.

○Same as Sashimi
Wash as usual, fillet into three pieces, and cut finely from the edge. Then pass through well-boiling water three or four times, and when the flesh turns white and puffs up, cool well before using.
Daikon radish, wood ear mushrooms, myoga, lotus potato, rock mushrooms, water dropwort/mitsuba
In addition to the above, serve with nanban vinegar or vinegar miso as appropriate.

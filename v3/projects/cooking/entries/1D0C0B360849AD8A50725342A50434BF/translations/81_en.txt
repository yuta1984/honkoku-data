○Whale with thick sauce (ankake)
Cut very good whale meat appropriately and quickly parboil it, serving with accompaniments such as:
Dried turnip, roasted chestnuts
Lily bulbs, ginkgo nuts  
Daikon radish, burdock root
Pickled matsutake mushrooms, pickled shimeji mushrooms
Use any of the above as side dishes and serve with light soy sauce broth. It is also good to place miso varieties underneath or pour over the top.

○Same steamed in tea bowls (chawan-mushi)
Use very high-quality meat, properly salt-cured with salt removed, with ingredients such as:
Wood ear mushrooms, ginkgo nuts
Lily bulbs, scallions cut in half-inch pieces
Pickled matsutake, pickled shimeji
Add about three types of such ingredients and steam in tea bowls as usual.
Fish fillets, shellfish on skewers, sea cucumber
Ark shells, fresh shellfish, etc. may also be added.
If ingredients are not available at the moment, anything on hand will do. Even just leeks alone are very good. Water greens, parsley, shaved burdock root - all of these types are good. It makes a very refined and flavorful dish.

○Same with vinegar miso
As before, take good whale meat and cut it very finely and cleanly

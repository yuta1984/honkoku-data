○Wind-blown (Crab Shinjo Dumplings)
When female crabs have roe, remove the shell and take the roe along with the roe around the edges of the back shell. Scrape the meat well and put everything together in a mortar, grinding well. Add a little egg white and grind again. Then season appropriately with bonito dashi and soy sauce, scoop the ground mixture and add it to the broth, bring to a boil once and serve with hidden ginger and pepper. This is an extremely good dish. It's also very good made with miso.
It's also good boiled and served with kuzu starch sauce.
It's also good steamed in tea bowls or small cups like savory egg custard.

○Pot-simmered
Take small crabs, remove the legs and claws, wash well, coat a pot with sesame oil, put them inside and grill well both inside and outside, then serve with ginger vinegar or grated daikon with soy sauce.

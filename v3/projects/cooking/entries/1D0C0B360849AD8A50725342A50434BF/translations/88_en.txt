Use anything suitable as garnish.

○Same, kenchin roll
For this preparation, take a very large sea cucumber,
quickly season it, then
cut off both ends, and spread fish
surimi thinly on one sheet of raw yuba,
place the sea cucumber on top, scatter
mitsuba or seri stems, then
gradually roll from the end
and secure the roll well, deep-fry in oil,
cut into rounds and use for
hachi-zakana (bowl appetizers) or
confectionery bowls and such—
this is an extremely delicious dish.

○Same, ikomi (stuffed)
As before, take a very tender
large sea cucumber and
stuff its belly with surimi mixed with shiitake mushrooms,
ginkgo nuts, mitsuba and such ingredients,
close it up tightly so nothing leaks out,
wrap and secure with bamboo skin or paper,
then steam.
Alternatively, prepare as above and secure with paper
in two or three places, then deep-fry in oil—
either way is good. Cut into rounds
and use for confectionery bowls, clear soups,
or bowl appetizers.

Particularly good are flounder, itoyori sea bream, mackerel, horse mackerel, charcoal-grilled fish, and muroaji (round scad).
Any of these fish types are suitable.

○Flounder in Kudzu Sauce
Wash well as usual, fillet into three pieces, and cut into small cubes. Simmer with sake, salt, and soy sauce, then make a kudzu starch sauce with the cooking liquid, pour it over the fish, sprinkle with green nori seaweed and serve. 《Japanese pepper powder is also good》

Same dish with Miso
Fillet into three pieces as before and cut into small cubes. Add miso with 《ginger and red pepper》 or 《Japanese pepper powder and black pepper powder》 - any of these will do - along with plenty of sake and salt, simmer down, and cook the fish in this mixture.
This should be served as a lidded dish.
Spiny lobster, kuruma shrimp, fresh shellfish, sea cucumber, ark shell, whelk
Among these, shellfish should be added from the beginning and simmered down. All of these make excellent accompaniments to sake.

○Same Fish - Kabitan-zuke (Kabitan Pickle)
As usual, thoroughly remove the head and black innards,
grill plain and deep-fry in sesame
oil. Quickly blanch sliced green onions,
finely slice shiitake mushrooms,
add wood ear mushrooms and red peppers, combine
all these together and pickle in sanbaizu (three-part vinegar) or
nihaizu (two-part vinegar). Even after many days
pass, the flavor doesn't change.
Similarly, if you pickle in the morning and use it after
noon, the flavor will be exceptionally
delicious.

times, changing the pickle as before,
and generally by the fifth or sixth time
the vinegar penetrates, then keep it under
pressure as is. Serve with water pepper, red pepper,
eggplant, daikon radish, etc.

○Quick Steamed Fish Paste (Can be used with sea bream, rough fish, lizardfish, eel, pike conger)

With any fish, wash well with water as usual, fillet into three pieces, take only the flesh and scrape off the skin. Then chop thoroughly with a knife to make a paste, add a little salt and a little sake, and thin with water. At this time, add a little egg white and mix to the right consistency, place in appropriately sized sake cups or small tea bowls and steam, then serve with kudzu starch sauce or tamari soy sauce. Miso [partially missing] is also good. Wasabi, Japanese pepper, black pepper, ginger, yuzu (sliced in rounds or decorative flower cuts) - beyond these, combine and use as appropriate.

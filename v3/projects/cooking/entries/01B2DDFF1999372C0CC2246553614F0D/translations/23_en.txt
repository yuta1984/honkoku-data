Diagram of capturing sebi whales (humpback whales) and harpooning them off Cape Misaki of Ikitsuki

Numerous chase boats (called seko boats) surround the whale and drive it until it comes within about two to three chō of the ajiro (net formation). Six Futami boats (each pair of two boats with their sterns joined together, making three units in total) are arranged in three formations and wait in ambush. Responding to the oyaji's signal, they row apart to the left and right, simultaneously stretching the three sets of nets across. The seko boats, leaving the front direction open, attack from three directions - left, right, and rear - beating the gunwales as usual and raising war cries to drive the whale. The whale, with nowhere to go, flees forward and gets caught in the nets, and while struggling in confusion, the fine ropes binding the nets break, causing the nets to wrap around its head and tail fins in multiple layers. Still trying to escape, it swims out beyond the encirclement of chase boats, and when it surfaces to blow and breathe, the chase boats do not miss the opportunity and thrust their harpoons. This is called the "first harpoon." The method of driving sebi (za-tō), and nagasu into the ajiro is like this.

Among them, the ko-kujira (right whale) has a strong and clever nature, showing no fear of driving calls and rarely entering the ajiro. Even when caught in nets, it rages violently and damages the nets, so it is usually cornered without nets and captured only by harpooning. Since sebi is the finest grade, it is prized and called hon-uo (main fish), while others are called zafumono (miscellaneous goods). The value of one sebi equals two zafumono, so even when encircling zafumono, if a sebi is spotted, they abandon the former and go after the sebi.

When whales are first spotted and the seko boats approach, the ship markers change according to the species. This is because there are specific methods for pursuing different types of whales, as various whales are not all the same.

Sebi (marker erected at the ship's bow; if with calf, a straw mat is hung on a water pole and erected at the stern)
Za-tō (marker erected at the ship's stern; when with calf, a straw mat is hung on a water pole and erected at the ship's bow)
Nagasu (only a small finger-sized marker erected at the stern; when with calf, a white flag is attached below the small marker)
Ko-kujira (marker erected slightly tilted on the ship's side; this is called "Nonko"; no marker for calves)

When the mountain lookouts spot them, they raise smoke at two locations for sebi, and at one location for zafumono. They also move the signal smoke in the direction the whale is swimming to serve as a signal.

**Long-handled knife (naga-e hōchō)**
Blade approximately 2 feet long, handle 8 feet. Carried on the first and second chief boats. This is used when a right whale is caught in the net - since harpoons cannot pierce through directly, it cuts through the blowhole barrier, threads the rope through, and ties it to the escort boat. This long-handled knife is used to make vertical cuts along the whale's back at intervals of 2-3 feet to kill it. Right whales have thin skin, fine sinews, and soft flesh, so harpoons do not hold and slip out; therefore, they are killed by cutting in this manner.

Diagram of the Hazashi Dance at the Naya-ba (Whaling Station) of Misaki, Ikitsuki

The hairstyle of the hazashi (harpooners). As shown in the diagram, unlike ordinary people, their topknots are also extremely long. 《Note: "ori" is the local dialect word for topknot (mage).》 This is because when hunting whales, they dive to the ocean floor, and when they somehow surface, exhausted and lacking the strength to climb aboard the ship, those on the ship sometimes grab their hair bundles to pull them up.

This hazashi dance is performed by these men as a custom three times: before the whaling group's departure from Ichibu-ura, during the celebration on the night of January 9th at Misaki-ura for the group's departure, and similarly when the group returns. What is depicted here is the dance performed when the group returns.

First, beginning with the master, thirty harpooners line up in order. When they beat drums and strike up music, they sing hazashi songs in unison. The lyrics go: "Hooking onto the pulley at the whaling station, there's no time to spare winding up the great whale. 《Iyo》 No time to spare. No time to spare winding up the pregnant whale. 《Beginning and end omitted》" While singing such songs, they perform what is called the "pulley dance," dancing in a circular formation.

All of them are stalwart men who could deceive sumo wrestlers. They tie towels around their heads as headbands, spread their arms wide, stamp with great strides, dance and sing, chanting various celebratory words and mimicking the scenes of whale hunting - it is truly magnificent. There are established melodies for this as well, and naturally one can distinguish the skilled from the unskilled. It is amusing to watch the many fisherwomen's daughters who gather to observe, discussing the merits and demerits, pointing and staring intently while chattering among themselves.

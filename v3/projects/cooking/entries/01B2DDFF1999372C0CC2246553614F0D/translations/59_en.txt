**Diagram of Sinew Production**
Sinews are found in the interior of round cuts, above and below the triple joints, on both sides of the shells, on the back skin, lower abdomen, and flanks. They are scraped from these locations, salted, placed in straw bags, and stored in the sinew warehouse. At the sinew warehouse, they are removed from the bags, placed in tubs, soaked in water and bleached. They are then removed from the tubs, the outer skin is peeled off, and they are placed back in tubs, soaked in water to remove blood and oil. After being removed from the tubs, they are split into thin strips, scraped with a knife, placed back in tubs for bleaching, and on clear days, hung on poles to dry. When they become like water buffalo hair, they are packed in boxes and sent to urban areas for sale. They are used for cotton bow strings, and craftsmen have many other uses for them.

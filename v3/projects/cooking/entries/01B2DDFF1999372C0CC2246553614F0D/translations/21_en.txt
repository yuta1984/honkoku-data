Diagram of driving humpback whales into the ajiro (net enclosure) off Cape Misaki, Ikitsuki

The humpback whale has longer breathing intervals than the sebi whale, blows water in a single stream, and swims in the deep parts of the ocean.
The nagasu whale swims even deeper than this, has very long breathing intervals, and blows water very high in a single stream, as if cutting through the air. Therefore, in the deep waters offshore, the nets cannot reach the required depth, so the whales must be driven close to the ajiro for capture.

First, when a humpback whale is spotted, a signal flag is raised at the stern, and numerous seko boats, each rowing eight oars, quickly surround the whale. When they approach the ajiro, they arrange their formation at intervals of about fifty to sixty ken, holding kari-bo (hunting sticks) - round wooden sticks about two feet long - in both hands, striking the gunwales on the front side of their boats, making battle cries, and fearlessly riding the terrible rough waves, shouting "ei, ei" as they drive the whale. The oyaji (boat captain) raises his command baton to direct operations. When he points right, the seko boats open to the right and circle left; when he points left, they circle right, blocking the whale's escape route and driving it close to the ajiro, considering the tidal conditions.

The first oyaji signals the second, third, and net-door oyaji to connect the nets. This signal is given by crossing the command batons held in both hands. When the signal to deploy the nets is given by raising both command batons, the futami boats line up stern to stern in pairs (one unit of two vessels each), with a total of three units (six vessels) standing ready. They temporarily tie together the ends of nineteen tan of netting with small ropes, then row apart to spread the net in a circle. (As already described in the section on net-house net construction.)

At this time, if even one of the four oyaji does not consent and fails to raise his command batons, the futami crew will not deploy the nets, fearing that mistakes might occur.

The central unit is called the mito (net door). This is the front face that the whale should approach. The futami nets on the left and right overlap more than halfway with the mito net, so the mito section is triple-layered, the left and right sides are double-layered, and beyond that single-layered. When the whale is driven straight forward, it will be covered by the triple-layered net.

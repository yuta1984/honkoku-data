Diagram of support vessels (mojisō-bune) capturing and rowing with a whale in the offing of Misaki at Ikitsuki

They thread the rope for the shōji-tsuri through the hole of the hand-form cut and tie it to the ship. When many harpoons are thrust into the whale's back and flanks, if they reach the internal organs, seawater enters through its mouth and bubbles rise to the surface, which is called "waku" (to well up) in local dialect. Then, determining the whale's half-dead, half-alive state, the leader (oyaji) holding the command baton signals that the support vessels should engage. Skilled swimmers called hazashi, carrying ropes, dive into the sea. They examine the mesh of the entangling net and very quickly swim under the whale's belly, passing body ropes around two places - the chest area and the abdomen. When they surface, two support vessels sandwich the whale from left and right, with a mojisō pillar laid across the top, assembled like a raft. Several hazashi ride on the whale, and the chest and abdominal body ropes that were passed around are tied to these support vessels, called the upper body rope and lower body rope. Afterward, they stab it to death with harpoons and large cutting knives. As it dies, the whale stretches its body, takes a great breath, cries out once, and while tied to the ships, circles two or three times, making gurgling sounds in its throat before expiring. At such times, the fishermen chant "Namu Amida Butsu" three times in unison and sing "Sangoku-ichi ya ōsebi-tori sumaita."

Whales not fully covered by the net thrash about wildly, creating waves with their tail flukes. If they strike a ship, the vessel is smashed to pieces. Even just touching the violent winds they create can overturn ships. When cutting with harpoons, if the whale is not yet weakened but the hand-form is cut and body ropes are threaded and attached to the support vessels, it will thrash wildly from that point, carrying the two ships and diving in and out of the sea two or three times, reducing the ships to powder. However, since the fishermen quickly dive into the sea, they are not injured. For such occasions, they transfer to reserve support vessels. After the whale is killed, using the support vessels as floats, two pulling ropes are attached, and more than ten vessels arranged in two rows tow it to Misaki Bay.

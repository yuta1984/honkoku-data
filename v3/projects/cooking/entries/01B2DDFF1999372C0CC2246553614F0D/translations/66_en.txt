**Sword Complete Diagram**
Including the head, it is 3 shaku long and weighs 1 kan 900 monme. The shaft is made of oak wood and measures 1 jō 2 shaku, with a 13-fathom arrow rope weighing 270 monme. As mentioned in the previous section, when a whale is caught in the nets and all the harpoons have been thrust into it, and as the subsidiary boats pull it along, when the whale weakens, they thrust this sword into it many times to half-kill it. Then they cut the nasal septum, thread a rope through it, and tie it to the main paired boats. When several swords are thrust into the whale's back and flanks, reaching the internal organs, seawater enters through the wounds and bubbles float up to the sea surface. This is called "welling up" (yū). Observing this boundary between life and death, the harpooner enters the sea and threads ropes through two places under the whale's belly, which are then attached to the main paired boats. Then they thrust repeatedly with this sword until the whale is killed.

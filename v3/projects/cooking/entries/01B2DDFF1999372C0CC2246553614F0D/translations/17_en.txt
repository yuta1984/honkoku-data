Illustration of the Organization (Kumide) at Masutomi's Residence in Ichibu-ura, Ikitsuki

Every year, around the solar term of Shōkan (Lesser Cold), within about ten days before and after, when organizing the whaling expedition (kumide), the roles are predetermined.

Head supervisors (2 people), supervisors (3 people), young men (50 people), net handlers (3 people), fish cutters (18 people), sinew scrapers (12 people)
Rice cooks (2 people), tea servers (2 people), managers (8 people), bone oil handler (1 person), guards (7 people), carpenters (3 people), blacksmith (1 person)
Cooper (1 person), net carpenter (1 person), harpooners (30 people), apprentice harpooners (3 people), whale boat crew members (440 people)

In total, 587 people are stationed at Misaki. The harpooners (hazashi) stand at the bow of ships, use various harpoons to strike whales, cut through the whale's nostril to attach ropes, dive to the ocean floor, swim under the whale's belly, and skillfully maneuver body ropes around from one side to another. Their actions are beyond description in words. Among the harpooners of the first, second, and third scout boats, each leader is called "oyaji" (father), who holds a commander's baton and directs the advance and retreat of all boats. Also, among the harpooners on the six twin-sea boats, there is one called the "net oyaji" who holds a baton and gives commands when spreading the nets. These four oyaji are most revered by the boat crews.

The harpooner of the fourth scout boat is called the elder (shukurō), ranking second to the oyaji. Below them is a hierarchy, and promotion through these ranks is called "role assignment" (yakuwari). Before the kumide, there is a celebration called "group departure celebration" where everyone gathers at Masutomi's house for a banquet and performs harpooner dances to celebrate the departure. During the ten days around Shōkan, they select a Day of the Ox (ushi no hi), assemble the crew, and depart from Ichibu-ura. They raise a banner with the ox horn crest at the bow and perform "shikatagoē" - mimicking the manner of reporting when a whale is caught, beating drums and making noise. They row the boats around, face toward a certain peak for distant worship, also worship at a certain shrine enshrined in Ichibu-ura, and then head to Misaki. Since they stay at Misaki for about 150 days, even though people travel by sea route, they give farewell gifts as if for horses and mutually express reluctance to part. The reason for using the Day of the Ox for kumide and raising the ox horn crest banner is that the ox's cry sounds like "mō," and horns are good at piercing things, so taking this meaning, it represents the wordplay of "let's pierce (mō tsukō) the whale."

Even before the kumide, from 40-50 days before Shōkan, as whales gradually begin to migrate, guard boats are stationed at two locations, Kurama and Nagori. When whales are spotted, immediately from Ichibu-ura, one set of twin-sea boats (2 vessels) and scout boats (which are fishing boats gathered from various bays) set out for opportunistic hunting.

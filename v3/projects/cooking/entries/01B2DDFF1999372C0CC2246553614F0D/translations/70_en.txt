**Epilogue on Whale Hunting**

In the age of the gods, when the deity of food turned his head toward the ocean plains, broad-finned and narrow-finned creatures emerged from his divine mouth, and thereafter people of the world came to obtain much bounty from the sea. Among these, there is no great fish superior to the whale, and no catch surpasses it. In the territory governed by the provincial governor of Hizen Province, the areas around the islands called Matsuura County, Hirado, Iki, and Ochika are skilled in the art of whale hunting, and a certain Masutomi, chief of the fishermen of Ikitsuki Island, devotes considerable effort to this pursuit.

The Iki Fudoki records that Isafushi Village got its name because long ago, when a whale fled and hid from a pursuing crocodile, the crocodile caught up, and both transformed into stones together. This area has been rich in whales since ancient times, and they were also called "isa." Princess Sotohoshi also composed a poem with "isana-tori" (whale-hunting), and examples in the Man'yōshū are too numerous to enumerate. References to whales appear in the Nihon Shoki in the reign of Emperor Bidatsu, in the Izumo Fudoki's section on Keta Island, in the Hitachi Fudoki's section on Kuji County, and others. The Shinsen Jikyō, Ruiju Myōgishō, and Jikyō-shū present the names of various whale species including gei, kujira, and kon. In Chinese texts, this fish appears in the Zuozhuan for the twelfth year of Duke Xuan in the Spring and Autumn Annals, the Lanming chapter of the Huainanzi, Jia Yi's rhapsody in the Book of Han, the biography of Zhai Fangjin, Ban Gu's biography in the Book of the Later Han, and Xu Shen's Shuowen,

Illustration of Net-Making at the Warehouse of Misaki in Ikitsuki

From mid-August, over fifty people from Tajima in Bingo Province come down and begin net-making or rope-braiding at the warehouse area of Misaki, staying until the spring of the following year, also serving as crew members of the paired-boat vessels and performing net-spreading work. {{Note: Paired-boat vessels refers to two boats positioned side by side to spread one set of nets on the sea, hence the name.}} Among them, one skilled craftsman is called the net carpenter, who is permanently stationed at the warehouse to handle rope repairs.

Generally, one set of whale nets consists of three "knots" (sections). One knot comprises thirty-eight panels. One panel is twenty-five fathoms vertically, and when spread out, it measures eighteen fathoms square. The ends of each panel are temporarily connected mesh by mesh with thin rope about as thick as two strands of braided straw, and a total of nineteen panels are joined together and loaded onto one paired-boat vessel, so one knot requires two boats.

When a whale is spotted and nets are to be spread, the sterns of the paired boats are brought together, the ends of the nineteen panels of nets loaded on each boat are tied together with thin rope, and then they row apart in both directions while spreading the nets in a circle. This constitutes one knot, and when this is arranged in three stages - center, left, and right - it is called one set.

There are two types of nets: new nets and two-year nets. There is a specific method for making them. For new nets, three-year-old material is used for the topmost stage, two-year-old for the second stage, newly made for the third stage, two-year-old for the fourth stage, three-year-old for the fifth stage, four-year-old for the sixth stage, and five-year-old material for the bottom seventh stage. For two-year nets, four-year-old material is used for the top stage, three-year-old for the second stage, two-year-old for the third stage, three-year-old for the fourth stage, four-year-old for the fifth stage, and the sixth stage is replaced. The reason for using newly made material in the middle stage is that this is where the whale makes contact. Using old material in the lower stages ensures that when entangled with rocks on the seabed, it doesn't restrain the whale's body when it touches, easily breaking away so that damage doesn't extend to the middle stage and above. If the lower stage nets were strong and didn't break away, the damage would extend to the upper and middle stages.

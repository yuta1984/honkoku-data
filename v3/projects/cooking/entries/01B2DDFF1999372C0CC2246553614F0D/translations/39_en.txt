Diagram of the Small Processing House (Ko-naya) at Misaki-ura, Ikitsuki

The entrance of the small processing house is a tile-roofed building, with thatched temporary buildings built continuously behind it. There are two head supervisors, one bookkeeper, ten young workers, four fish cutters, one cook, two drum watchmen (selected from among the young workers to keep watch through the night), two managers, and including day laborers, a total of about 110 people. They work busily without respite. What is brought into this processing house includes: mountain skin, fins, fan bones, meat from large bones, ribs, small whiskers, organs (everything below this refers to organ parts), throat ring, liver, lungs, stomach, hyakuhiro, choji, red intestines, large intestines, small intestines, organ meat, upper intestines, small intestines, and karakimo. Generally, there is nothing in a whale - bones, skin, meat, or organs - that cannot be used as food, but only this karakimo is not eaten. It is said that the fish cutters take this as their private reward, but it is unknown what they use it for.

At the entrance of the processing house sits the bookkeeper, and behind him is the small cutting area where about twenty people sit in rows, performing small cutting in the same manner as the main processing house. On the right side is a fish shelf where the usual fine cutting is performed. Items with oil are boiled in oil, and bones still attached with meat are scraped off with axes, with only the remaining bones sent to the bone processing house. Behind this, seven furnaces are set up with large cauldrons to boil oil. The oil flows through pipes from within the earthen walls at the front of the furnaces into six large iron pots where it is stored, following the same procedures as the main processing house. At the entrance of the processing house sits a search guard who interrogates the kantaro (workers) and searches out meat they have secretly hidden away, punishing them regularly.

There is also a separate tendon processing house. Seven young workers, twelve tendon scrapers, and one supervisor work there, processing the tendons from round cuts sent from the main processing house - the upper and lower parts of the "three-piece," both sides of the "shell," back skin, etc. - scraping them and selling them to merchant ships. "Kosagu" is the same as the Kanto dialect word "kosogeru" (to scrape).

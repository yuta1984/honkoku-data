However, today no one can match the Masutomi of Ikitsuki Island. Now, whales are the most precious among all fish. In foreign countries they are called the "fish king," and in our country they were offered as food to Emperor Jimmu, as can be seen in the imperial poems recorded in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. Even in the culinary texts of the Shijo school, while carp is considered the finest delicacy, they say that whale is superior even to that. Needless to say, oil is extracted for use in lamps, it drives away locusts from rice paddies and removes moth larvae from dry fields, and is wonderfully effective at killing all manner of insects. When fed to small children, its efficacy is the same as that of eel.

To detail the methods for capturing such whales and even teach the ways of seasoning them, thereby bringing benefit to the people, should be called an illustrated narrative of high merit under heaven. In the year called Bunsei 12, at the beginning of autumn, Oyamada Tomokiyo of Edo humbly records this.

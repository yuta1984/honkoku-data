Diagram of the Main Processing House (Ōnaya) at Misakiura, Ikitsuki

The tile-roofed building at the entrance of the main processing house has a frontage of seven ken and a depth of twelve ken. Even during breaks in fishing activities, it remains standing and is continuously used. Behind it, a temporary building with a thatched roof and a depth of twelve and a half ken is constructed as an extension. This is demolished during breaks in fishing activities.

Further back, there is an oil storehouse. In this main processing house, various parts such as back skin, side skin, round cuts, head (kabachi), shelves, beak, tail flukes, grip, tongue, red meat from the back, kai, and takeri are stored and processed in various ways. The skin is cut finely and boiled in oil. The tail flukes are called "teira," the meat is called "red meat," and these are salted and sold throughout various provinces via merchant ships for food. Everything else suitable for oil is boiled into oil, bones are sent to the bone storehouse, and tendons found in the round cuts, between skin and flesh, lower belly, and side belly are sent to the tendon storehouse to be processed into scraped and dried products for merchant ships.

On the right side of the main processing house entrance are stationed: two head supervisors (one called the weigher), two bookkeepers, twenty-five young men, fourteen fish cutters (two of these called intermediate shift workers), rope handlers (selected from regular day laborers who receive instructions from the offshore crew and attach ropes to whales on the beach), two drum operators (selected from the young men for night watch duty), two pot operators (fish cutters serve in dual roles), scouts (fish cutters serve in dual roles and inspect the kandara), two cooks, two tea servers, five supervisors, plus day laborers - totaling about two hundred people who work without respite.

Below the wall on the right side of the thatched building is a small cutting area. About seventy to eighty people sit in rows, each with a cutting tub placed in front, with small ropes above to hang oil-rich skin pieces, which they take and cut small to put in the tubs. Whetstones are placed nearby, and they occasionally sharpen their knives with their left hands.

Below the wall opposite the small cutting area, in a place one level lower than the ground, bamboo screens are set up in what is called the "fish shelf" for cutting and processing various skins and meats. Next to this are seventeen furnaces. At the back, passages are built as high as the furnaces, and climbing the stone steps, one finds large rendering cauldrons set on each of the seventeen furnaces. The small-cut oil-rich skin is put into these to render oil. Around the front area of the furnace tops, earth walls are plastered to prevent the furnace fire from reaching the oil in the cauldrons. Gutters run along the inner surface of these earth walls to channel the oil from the cauldrons into fifteen or sixteen large jars installed in the oil storehouse.

There are many other matters, but I omit them to avoid tedium.

It is delicious. After the sixth boiling, strain the broth.
Simmer with the finest soy sauce and bonito stock.
By the time the broth is ready, the udon will be well cooked.

Flat Noodles (Kishimen)

Knead udon flour without salt, trample as usual,
roll thin, cut into strips about five bu (approximately 1.5 cm) wide, and
adjust with broth. If you use too much dusting flour,
the broth becomes sticky. It's better to use less dusting flour and make
the broth abundant. For the broth, especially use large pieces of bonito, add the udon
noodles and boil until done. Cut scallions into pieces about two sun (approximately 6 cm) long, add plenty
and boil, then add the aforementioned udon for use.
Bonito with the flesh included when making the noodles is also interesting.

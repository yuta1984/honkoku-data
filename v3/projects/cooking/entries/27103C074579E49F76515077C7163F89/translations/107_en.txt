Spread and roll it, boil in hot water, and when cut it looks like sōmen noodles.

Watermelon with Sugar

One large watermelon, using only the red parts with seeds removed and cut up.
One hundred monme of white sugar, remove impurities. If the watermelon is medium-sized,
ninety monme of sugar is also acceptable. Remove the skin from ginger,
boil in hot water and cut up to add. The amount can be adjusted to taste. Using a thin-bottomed
pot, simmer well until the juice becomes sticky and store in a jar—
the flavor will remain unchanged indefinitely.

Grilled Wheat Gluten

Thread skewers through and place the wheat gluten on them to grill. Turn them over
together with the skewers, which works well. Grill both sides thoroughly,
then remove the skewers afterward.

Long-lasting Whitebait

To keep whitebait for a long time, coat them with rice bran and store—
they will last nine to ten days.

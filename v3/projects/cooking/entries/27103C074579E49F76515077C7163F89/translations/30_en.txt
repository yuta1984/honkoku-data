Ōmi Samegai Mochi (Rice Cakes from Samegai, Ōmi Province)
Put about three shō of the finest glutinous rice into one mortar and pound it. Select each grain carefully so that they are uniform in size. Steam as usual, then pound into rice cakes without using water. Dry them and weave them with cut straw, then hang them in a place where wind cannot reach them. It is best to make these during the cold season. If you boil them or similar, they become useless, and in that case the quality deteriorates.

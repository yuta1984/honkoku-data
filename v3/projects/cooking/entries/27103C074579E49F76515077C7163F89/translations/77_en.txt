Ryōri Sankaigō Volume 4

Naniwa-tsu

Take only the flesh of pickled plums, mix in sugar and knead together. Spread this on shiso leaves, add hemp seeds one by one little by little, then roll up. Cut into pieces of about 5-6 bu (approximately 1.5-1.8 cm). Sprinkle with pickling sugar and set aside. Use after the sugar has permeated throughout the flesh.

Ōkura-ni (Ōkura Style Simmered Fish)
Whether sea bream, crucian carp, or common carp, make cuts and skewer them, then grill them white until they appear charred. Add a little Japanese pepper to miso, dilute with kuzu starch water, and coat thickly so the fish is not visible, then grill evenly without burning. Scrape with the cut edge of a confection to make it smooth, remove any roughness, and simmer with sake mixed with a little soy sauce in proper proportion. It is named this because the miso does not fall off.

Rikyū-shō (Rikyū Sauce)
Take two shō of hulled barley, soak in enough water to cover overnight, then wash well. Roast soybeans, remove the hulls, split in half, rub at the bottom of a mortar to remove skins, wash well and steam, then apply koji mold. After that, dry thoroughly, winnow the koji with a basket, then sift through a sieve to separate the koji. Dry for another day. One shō and five gō of white koji, one shō and five gō of quality sake, one shō and five gō of quality soy sauce - mix the sake and soy sauce well...

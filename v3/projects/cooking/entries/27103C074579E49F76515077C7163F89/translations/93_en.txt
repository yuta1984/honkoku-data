You can prepare any amount depending on the liquid portion of soybeans and such.


　　　Sand Lance Soy Sauce (Ikanago Shoyu)

Add seven to eight sho of salt to five sho of seawater and boil it down, then add sand lance fish and cook. Place a strainer on top of the barrel to lift them out. Put this cooked fish 《in Kyoto and Osaka, 
something like needlefish》 in the barrel and skim off the floating foam. This is used in various regions. Block the spout at the bottom of the barrel, leaving only the salt liquid, add water, and boil like this many times. Later, don't add salt - it will gradually develop color and become like soy sauce. This is called sand lance soy sauce. It's good to use according to the condition of the fish. Make this from December to around April.

The sea bream of Naruto from the eight hundred paths of tide,
The wild geese crying as they point toward the reed banks,
Their provisions, through proper preparation methods,
Their hospitality and abundant vegetation of
this mountain-sea realm - at its beginning, I was requested
to add some words of my own

I speak of praising and completing this skill

In the spring of Kanʼen, year of tsuchinoto-mi (Earth-Sheep)

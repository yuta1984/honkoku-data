Turnip Dengaku
Cut turnips to dengaku size, skewer them and grill. Brush with soy sauce once and grill until not burnt, apply a little oil and add miso paste. The appearance is the same as tofu dengaku, and it is exceptionally warm. Without brushing with soy sauce once, it will not grill properly. Even if you skip applying soy sauce, it will not penetrate to the interior.

Kashiwa Nama-fu Yaki (Grilled Oak Leaf Wheat Gluten)
Boil oak leaves well, remove the skin, crush and put in a mortar, strain with water, put in a flat container and stir. When it becomes appropriately sticky, scoop it out. Do not let it become too sticky as this is bad. From this point, grill like regular nama-fu yaki. For seasoning, Japanese pepper, miso, and hemp seeds are good.

Nishi-jiru (Western Soup)
Pound grilled miso and make it into soup, boil it slightly and add.

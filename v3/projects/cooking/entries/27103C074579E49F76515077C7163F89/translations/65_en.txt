Fry in oil after cutting.

Smoked Roasting (Kun-yaki)
Place a whole sea bream in water, insert a bamboo tube into its mouth, coat the entire fish well with red clay, place it over a large pot, and pour soy sauce through the bamboo tube while roasting. Judge the proper timing by smelling the soy sauce aroma coming from the bamboo tube. When the clay cracks from the back, the scales will come off together. Use without sprinkling salt.

Frozen Tofu
Cut one block of tofu into eight pieces, arrange in a basket, pour boiling water over them, leave outside overnight exposed to the cold air. The next morning, when frozen, cook in hot water until soft. When it floats to the surface, press it down slightly, then arrange in the basket again and dry. For this hot water cooking, split gardenia seeds should be added to the water - this is the proper method. During this process, it's best if it freezes during the night. Evening is not good.

Add two pieces of bonito flakes, boil, strain through a cloth bag, and filter three times by repeatedly ladling - this is good.

This volume of cooking does not follow the formal methods of knife work and cutting techniques, but rather consists of dishes made according to each person's preference. Therefore, there are no particularly fixed rules. However, I have named it "Ryōri Monogatari" (Tales of Cooking) because it records the stories people have told, preserving what has been heard and passed down from ancient times until today. The rare delicacies from distant provinces and famous places must number in the millions. Tomorrow too, there will be things to hear and see. I hope to add anything interesting that emerges. The fish and birds of mountains, fields, rivers, and seas - all created from nothing into an inexhaustible treasure, nurtured by rain and dew, taking countless forms without limit - who could count or measure them all? Even among what we hear of now, I preserve what seems desirable, though I may also forget beautiful things. These are merely rough thoughts - spring scenery, traveling skies, idle moments - I have let my brush run free. However, I myself do not know these matters in detail. Those with knowledge should inquire about oral traditions. Written in Sayama, Musashi Province.

Chapter 4: How to prepare sweet potato to resemble kelp
1. Peel raw sweet potatoes and cut them thinly like kelp.
   Put them in water, mix in a little salt,
   let sit for a while, then squeeze well and put them in the base broth
   to cook briefly. The key to this cooking process is
   to put just a little base broth in the pot,
   add the squeezed sweet potatoes,
   stir quickly, and remove immediately
   once they are lightly cooked. You may also add
   a few Japanese pepper seeds to the base broth and cook with that.
   Alternatively, you can roast Japanese pepper afterwards, grind it in a mortar,
   and sprinkle a little on top. This is to remove
   the earthy smell of the sweet potatoes.

   You can also make this dish with Chinese yam in the same way.
   If you do so, the Chinese yam will be pure white and the sweet potato will be
   yellow, and mixing them together makes it
   quite interesting.
   The secret technique for "tying mountain yam" is also
   said to be the same as this method.

some are also good. Some are good when first boiled hard, then later cooked. This should be understood, etc. In the sashimi section, whale is sliced thin, hot water is poured over it, and it is good with sansho pepper miso vinegar, etc. In the Bankikisho section, whale oki-zuke (offshore pickling): one sho of salt and one sho of water are boiled, cooled well, and soaked for three days. After that, it is opened and wrapped in tsuto (straw bundles) and kept indefinitely. There is also a tradition of leaving it soaked in barrels as is. Also, when pickled in sake lees with added salt and placed in jars, it becomes even better. Red meat does not keep for long, etc. Besides this, one should inquire into the cooking methods of ancient books. In the Shijō-ryū Hōchō-sho "Bibutsu Jōge no Koto" section, it states that whale should be served before carp without difficulty, but does not record the cooking method. In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, etc., in Emperor Jimmu's great imperial poem, "isukuhashi kujira sayari" appears, which was probably composed regarding the presence of whale in the imperial feast offerings at great banquets, but there is no way to know the preparation method. Since "isana-tori" (whale-catching) is frequently sung in poems in the Nihon Shoki, Man'yōshū, etc., it appears that from ancient times whale was primarily used as food.

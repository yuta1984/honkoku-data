Use appropriately with fish, dengaku (grilled tofu with miso), table dishes, and various other preparations.

　　　Plum Kernel Miso Method
First, wash about thirty medium-sized pickled plums, soak them in water overnight, drain well and remove the flesh. Also crack the pits to extract the kernels, peel off their outer skin, pound them well, put white miso to about eight-tenths full in a soup bowl, grind and mix all these ingredients well together, then add two cups of mirin (sweet cooking wine) and grind well. This is good for use with tea bowl dishes, dengaku, or for mixing with fish.

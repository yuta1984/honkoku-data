Use a knife to scrape off the outer skin of hon-bushi (premium bonito flakes), grate it with a wasabi grater, and add it to the aforementioned ground sake lees. However, if large, use one piece; if small, use two pieces. Mix these well by grinding, then roast half a cup of black sesame seeds and add to the aforementioned tofu, grinding and mixing each well. Then in a pot, add dashi soy sauce lightly to bind, add a little kudzu starch, and when it comes to a boil, scoop with a metal ladle and serve the portions that float up as they are. For condiments, use grated daikon radish, chili pepper powder, kaku-nori seaweed, finely chopped Asakusa nori seaweed, hana-katsuobushi or momi-katsuobushi - any single type is fine. Finely chopped green onions are also good. Regarding Yushima tofu, even in this locality, it depends on the cook's creativity. Alternatively, steaming it, letting it cool, cutting and layering it, and making it into sashimi is also excellent.

How to Make Noshi Shrimp
1. Remove the shell from kuruma shrimp and also remove the head. Leave the tail as is, sprinkle with kudzu powder, and place on a cutting board. Pound gently with a pestle, constantly sprinkling with kudzu, then put in a steamer basket and steam. After steaming, cool in water, then dry well and trim the edges neatly so the tail doesn't fall off.

For soups, confection bowls, chilled dishes, and drinking accompaniments, combine directly. The same method applies to Ise lobster. Both varieties are good for dai-hiki dishes.

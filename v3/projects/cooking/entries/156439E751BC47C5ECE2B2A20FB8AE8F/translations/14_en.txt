Method for Bird Dumplings
One: Whether snipe, quail, turtle dove, or skylark - whichever of these birds, pound them very well, or grind very well in a mortar. Place on the bottom of a wire strainer, and when pressed vigorously, the meat will fall through to the bottom. Add a little wheat flour to this, knead with egg white, making it slightly firm. Make it the size of dumplings, and put either azuki bean grains or green shelled beans inside the bird mixture - use just one type, roll it well, sprinkle kudzu powder on top, grill lightly on both sides on a grilling net, then put in a steamer and steam. Usage: one as a raised dish, one as finely sliced for portable food boxes, one as a pepper dish, one for Sendai-style soup. However, leave it to the discretion and preference of the cook.

Add one cup of sencha tea and simmer slowly. When the liquid is gone, add another cup of sake and one cup of tea to a rice bowl and continue cooking.
If you cook it rapidly, the skin will peel off. Cook it very gently, and
when all the liquid is gone, remove the octopus, quickly rinse it with tea,
rinse the pot as well, combine soy sauce with sake, and after boiling twice,
remove it and place the whole octopus in a bowl to serve. It can be
pinched and cut with chopsticks. This method is not commonly known. It is also
good to serve by placing one piece in a sake cup. There should be various ways to use it.

　　　Method for Sweet Potato and Octopus Soup
First, cut the octopus in half from the narrow end, make four or five continuous cuts of five to six bu,
separate the pieces, and simmer in sake and set aside. Then, dice the tofu,
cut the white part of scallions into five-bu pieces, dice the grilled tofu, taro, and
deep-fry the konnyaku in oil and cut into strips. Cut burdock root into five-bu pieces.
Add all of these ingredients and simmer slowly
with light miso. When the burdock root reaches the right tenderness, it is ready.
If the soup is too thin, add a little soy sauce or red miso.
The soup should be on the salty side. Take about three pieces of new earthenware,
fire them, and put them in the soup to simmer for a while.

Pack it well and pickle it in the sake lees, and it will be ready in four to five days. For long-term storage, use about four and a half gō of salt and apply pressure, and it will keep for one to two months. The preparation method is always the same as for fresh fish. This is excellent for tea cuisine.

　　　How to Make Kisu (Japanese Whiting) Pickled in Sake Lees and Miso

First, lightly salt the kisu. Mix about one shō of sake lees with three gō of salt, and knead well together. Remove the scales and clean the belly of the kisu thoroughly, wash with water, sprinkle with salt, and let sit for a while. Immediately, while still salted and without putting in water, pickle in the sake lees, layering one by one and pressing down while pickling. Miso pickling is done the same way. The preparation method for both is like fresh fish. After four to five days, take it out and wash it well. Whatever you use it for, the flavor will be exceptionally good.

First, sea bream goes well with miso. However, fillet it into three pieces before pickling. Small sea bream is good pickled whole. The preparation method is the same as for fresh fish in either case. Flatfish is also done the same way. For sweet sea bream, white miso is best. Using it with the miso still on is also exceptionally good.

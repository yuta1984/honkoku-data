How to Make Mixed Fish Salted Paste

First, thoroughly squeeze and wash the fine intestines of sea bream from around March and April, mix with plenty of salt and pickle for about half an hour. Also salt thin slices of sea bream for about half an hour, then shave dried bonito flakes, and mix these three ingredients together as they are. Cut wood ear mushrooms into thin strips, roast white sesame seeds, grate ginger, and mix all these ingredients well together. For about five cups of mixture, add one cup of salt, mix thoroughly again, put into a jar and press down. Pour about five shaku of finest aged sake on top, then cover tightly with mountain kelp as a lid. After the midsummer earth days pass, by around August it will be well-fermented and the flavor will become exceptionally good. If you don't take it out until the cold season, bring it out in the New Year of the following year for even better results.

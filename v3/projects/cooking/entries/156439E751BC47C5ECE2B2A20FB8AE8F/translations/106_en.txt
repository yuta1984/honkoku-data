First, strain the ground fish meat through a mesh ladle, and it will fall into the water through the holes of the ladle. However, press it with your hand to squeeze it out. Then scoop it up with a ladle, put it in hot water, and when it bubbles up, scoop it up and cool it in water.

　　　How to Make Mizore (Sleet) Pike Conger
First, take five egg whites, put them in a deep bowl, and whip with bamboo skewers until they foam. However, grind about one soup bowl's worth very well, add a little white sugar, gradually add about one soup bowl's worth of rice washing water, and grind it smooth to the softness of yudofu (hot tofu). Add the beaten egg that was prepared in the right bowl all at once into the ground fish meat and cook quickly. The ground fish meat will foam up and float - scoop it up and cool it in water, and it will become like real sleet. How to use: for hon-jiru, use red miso, goto miso, or arai miso, or for second course clear soup. For large flat dishes, add condiments and sprinkle on top. Also for suimono, thin kudzu dishes, with sucking mouth seasonings like squeezed ginger juice. For other pairings, if it's a little firm, it's also called yuki-hamu (snow pike conger).

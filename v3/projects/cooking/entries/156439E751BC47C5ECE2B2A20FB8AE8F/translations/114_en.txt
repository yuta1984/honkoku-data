First, prepare high-quality irico (dried small fish) or kinko. Take about five pieces of medium-sized katsuobushi (bonito flakes), wash them well and put them in a pot. Tie about three strands of straw and add them, add a little white sugar, add plenty of water, and simmer slowly over charcoal fire. When it starts to concentrate, add about one go (180ml) of sake, then remove and discard the straw. Simmer it well, prepare miso soup a bit on the salty side and add about half a go. When this too has simmered down, take out either the kinko or irico, wash once with water, drain well, and grind in a mortar until it becomes like miso. If you have about two go worth, add about one-third of one go of miso and grind together well. The usage is as written before. However, when paired with poultry, it is exceptionally good.

Method for Making Matsutake Hanpei (Matsutake Fish Cake)
Remove the skin from medium-sized matsutake mushrooms, cut off the stems, put the peeled caps into a mortar, crush them with the tip of a pestle to make them like a paste, add a little egg white, mix well, then add an appropriate amount of kan-zarashi (winter-bleached flour) powder and grind together.

However, if there is about five go (about 900ml) of paste, use five egg whites and half a go (about 90ml) of kan-zarashi flour. Mix this slightly thick, adding little by little while grinding together. Then put it in a tea bowl, steam it, transfer to another tea bowl, and serve. However, if boiled, the aroma will be lost and it won't be good. Alternatively, take out the steamed product and use it for flat plate sashimi, or in bowls, or sandwiched, for sake appetizers, tiered lunch boxes, clear soups, dai-biki dishes, layered sliced sashimi, dishes with seasoned miso base, and other uses as one thinks of.

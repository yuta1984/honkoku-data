Wash thoroughly, dry for a while until there is no moisture, mix white miso and red miso in equal parts, stuff it well into the bird's belly cavity, pack it tightly, place in a bowl, press down with the same miso on top and bottom, seal the lid tightly, and it will keep for up to six months even after a year has passed. ○Alternatively, soak kombu seaweed in white miso, stuff it into the bird's belly, wrap the top also with kombu, put it in a box, and store it away from wind. This is also good. It will be like fresh bird.

Method for Salt-Cured Bird
Take only the meat of wild goose or duck, salt it, wrap in kombu, and store in a jar - it will remain fresh like raw bird indefinitely without drying out. The bones should be removed first. Now, when cooking salt-cured bird, put lukewarm water in a bowl, soak the bird as is, and when the skin loosens, remove it and pluck the feathers as you would with fresh bird. Hot water is not good. The way to prepare this bird is to cut it thick, put a little salt in the lukewarm water, and the salt will come out of the bird quickly, which is good. If you stir it too much, the bird will fall apart, which is bad.

With this, there are still other methods for preparing birds.

When it turns white, process it like ham, applying sake little by little to the flesh as you work it. Then, grind it thoroughly in a mortar. Mix sake and water in equal parts, dissolve kan-zarashi flour in it, and gradually grind it in. From there, you can form it into boards, make chikuwa (bamboo rings), or make it soft and shape it into half-flat forms as desired.

However, use kan-zarashi flour to extend it. Kuzu (arrowroot) starch does not work well for this purpose.

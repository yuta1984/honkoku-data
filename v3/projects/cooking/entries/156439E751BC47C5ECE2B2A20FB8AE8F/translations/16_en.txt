Add a little rice bran miso to white miso soup and bring to a boil, then gradually add the broth to the ground bird meat while continuing to grind well. For seasonings: dried citrus peel, kaga seaweed, ground black sesame, powdered sansho pepper, and finely minced garlic.

Method for Bird Hanpei (Fish Cake)
One: For this hanpei, also use the bird meat from the previous section. Lightly cook this as well, grind it, season with sake and soy sauce. Then add a little winter-bleached flour and egg white, next add dashi stock. Soften a little hime-nori seaweed by grinding, then add it to the meat mixture and grind well to extend it. Put the meat in a tea bowl and steam it, then transfer to another vessel. Serve with kudzu sauce, wasabi miso, sansho pepper miso, or for plum kernel miso, add a little soy sauce with sake, thin it out, boil and pour over. This is also good for tea cuisine.

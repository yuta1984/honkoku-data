How to Use White Semi-Dried Chirimen Small Ayu

First, these snow-white small ayu come from Wakayama in Kishu Province. Wash them once in water, then in fresh water add plenty of white sugar and stir. Soak the small ayu for about half an hour, and they will become whiter in color and larger in size.

Usage methods: miso main soup, second course clear soup, suimono (clear soup), dressed namasu (vinegared salad), hikicha suimono (tea-flavored soup - this should be made with oka additions), or blanch once and serve as small dish items with pepper miso or mustard miso. Alternatively, blanch them, cool in water, sprinkle with white sugar mixed with roasted salt - good for portable lunch boxes.

How to Prepare Winter Sea Cucumber (振りなまこ - Shaken Namako Method)

First, put straw and sand in a basket, add the sea cucumbers whole, shake them well, then slice thickly from the narrow end while still whole. Mix with irizake (seasoned cooking sake), put in a tea bowl, steam thoroughly, and serve with wasabi miso, ginger miso, or kudzu starch sauce - all are good.

For quick sautéing, follow the same method. For sashimi or small dish preparations, either irizake or regular vinegar works well.

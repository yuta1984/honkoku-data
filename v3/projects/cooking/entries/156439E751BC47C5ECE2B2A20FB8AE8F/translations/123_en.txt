Let it dry. Make the sayori quite thin, cutting it lengthwise, without separating the tail section. However, make it about the thickness of udon noodles, arrange it in eight strands, tie the ends together, and blanch. Now, the usage is for confectionery bowls, senba, clear soups, dai-hiki,寄せ焼き物 (mixed grilled dishes), and beyond this, as you wish. Also, for using itoyori in sashimi, slice away the flesh in the same manner, dry in the sun, make quite thin, then put in water again, lift out after a while, arrange the prepared flesh neatly, and serve as sashimi. For this, the skin is most important.

Also, take seven or eight strands of the arranged ones, gather them together, tie them, trim both ends evenly, blanch, and make into a side dish. In some books, this is also called "thread-tied sayori."

　　　Red Kisu Preparation
1. For small kisu, scrape the scales well from both tail and head together. Good for appetizer fish and main fish dishes. Large ones are good for dai-hiki and mixed grilled dishes. For red-grilling, fillet into three pieces, remove the head, sprinkle a little salt, wash again, use distant fire, soak in fire-heated water, dry immediately, and grind red pigment to make it exceptionally beautiful. Also good to dye with brocade rouge, and good to arrange on a large inkstone lid.

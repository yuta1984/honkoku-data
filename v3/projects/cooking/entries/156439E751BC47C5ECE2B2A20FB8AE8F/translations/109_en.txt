Method for Squid Senhe-maki (Thousand-Layer Roll)
First, cut a large squid lengthwise in two, remove the ears from all four sides, slice thinly with a sashimi knife from the edge, making about ten pieces. Sprinkle with wheat flour, coat with egg white, press down firmly, do this with each piece as described above, then roll them up in sequence. Tie tightly at the top with straw rope, boil once in hot water and immediately soak in safflower dye, which is good. For yamabuki (mountain rose) color, add a little sake to gardenia and soak in this decoction. The usage should also be as before. Also use appropriately in main soup and second soup.

First, if it is a large squid, cut lengthwise, remove the ears from all four sides, slice what has been thinly cut with a sashimi knife into fine strips, put in lukewarm water and stir around. Also add a little hot water and immediately remove, which is good. Also, the extremely fine ones are called ito-ika (thread squid). For clear soup, use oka-ire, for first and second soups, use clear broth. For sashimi, red dyeing is also good. For namasu, use ike-mori presentation. For small dishes, it is good to serve with karashi miso. Or white vinegar, or kuzu-hiki is also good. All are oka-ire style.

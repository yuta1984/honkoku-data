Preface to One Hundred Tofu Delicacies
Soy milk is the transformation of grain particles, an example of the metamorphosis of matter. The Creator governs this process. Unlike inanimate objects, humans possess the ability to transform themselves. Though we can change ourselves, this too is according to the Creator's will. Change knows no bounds. Just as dragons appear and disappear, and flowers bloom and wither, the state of the world waxes and wanes accordingly, and human affairs shift in response. Things gather and scatter in this manner - nothing remains unchanged, nothing escapes the transformative force. Indeed, the arts of the King of Huainan belong to ancient times, yet the methods of preparation have been passed down through generations.

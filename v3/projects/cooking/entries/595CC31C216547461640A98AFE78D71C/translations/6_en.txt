Goto Miso
This is prepared like regular miso soup, boiled up, thinned in consistency, and strained.

Freshly Pounded Soup
Use regular miso. Pound it well with a knife on a board, dissolve in hot water, boil down, and leave unstrained.

Boiled-Through Soup
Without grinding regular miso, add dashi and sake, boil up, and strain through a water bag. However, thin the consistency slightly.

Natto Soup
Add natto beans whole to regular miso soup and bring to a boil, then scoop up with a miso strainer, grind the natto, and immediately thin with that broth.
However, grinding or pounding natto into the miso from the beginning makes the aroma disappear and is bad. When done as described above, the flavor is excellent and the grinding of the natto is perfectly balanced.

Go-jiru (Soybean Soup)
Soak green soybeans well in water, grind in a mortar, thin with white miso broth, strain through a cloth bag, and boil again.
However, when green soybeans are not available, regular white soybeans may be used, but green soybeans are better. In either case, thin the consistency. The meaning of "kage" (consistency) is detailed later.

Sake Lees Soup
Mix sake lees with miso in equal parts, thin with dashi, bring to a boil, and strain.

Rice Bran Miso Soup
Grind very old rice bran miso, thin with dashi, boil up, strain, and add soy sauce to adjust flavor. The term "soy sauce" is explained later.

Green Soup
Boil spinach, squeeze out water, grind well and mix into white miso, strain firmly through a water bag, thin with dashi, boil down, thin the consistency, and adjust flavor.
However, when spinach is not available, green powder may be used, but it is inferior.

Sesame Soup
For white sesame use white miso, for black sesame use regular miso, grind together, strain firmly through a water bag, thin with dashi, and bring to a boil.

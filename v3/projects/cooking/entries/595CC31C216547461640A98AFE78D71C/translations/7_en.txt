Thick Soy Sauce Soup
Squeeze water from tofu, grind well, add white miso and red miso in equal parts, mix by grinding, boil down and strain. However, it should be made thick.

Cold Soup
Form regular miso into balls and grill them, mix with various seasonings by grinding, thin with water, boil down, strain out solids and cool.
However, putting the boiled soup into a large sake bottle, sealing the mouth well, and suspending it in a well with rope to cool it is especially good during hot summer weather. Information about seasonings is in the previously mentioned book.

Mock Pufferfish Soup
Use fish with skin removed - flathead, cod, gurnard, or any similar type will do. Prepare the miso as regular hon-jiru (basic soup) and add soy sauce.

Crucian Carp Soup
Grill eel and chop finely, prepare as regular hon-jiru, and add soy sauce.

Same - Jellied Soup
Grill crucian carp and simmer thoroughly with sake, add a little over two parts red miso to regular miso, grind well, dissolve with the sake used to cook the carp, add a little kudzu starch, simmer the carp until reduced, transfer to a bowl and cool. In winter it freezes quickly. The same applies to carp.

Stomach Stir-Fry Soup
Remove carp stomach, make thread-thin cuts, pound the intestines well, stir-fry in a pot until fox-colored, remove sediment, add dashi, add a little red miso, boil up, and serve with cooked carp.
In summer, don't add scales - this is oral tradition.

Small Fish Soup
Prepare regular miso soup slightly thick and set aside, put small fish in a pot, stir-fry well with sake, then strain the soup in and boil down.

Whale Soup
Usually six parts white miso to four parts regular miso is good. Definitely add soy sauce. Using only regular miso with soy sauce is also acceptable.

Monkfish Soup
Use only regular miso, prepare like hon-jiru, and add soy sauce.
However, the monkfish should be blanched and soaked in sake.

Oni-gara-yaki　Spiny lobster, kuruma shrimp, crab and similar shellfish,
　　　　　　　grilled in their shells with Japanese pepper and soy sauce marinade

Tsubo-yaki　　Turban shells, oysters and other shellfish grilled in their shells
　　　　　　The preparation of turban shells is commonly known.
　　　　　　Grilled clams and others are all the same. Abalone shell-grilling
　　　　　　is also commonly known, so the method is not described.

Ita-yaki　　　Same as the cedar-plank grilling of young yellowtail
　　　　　　mentioned in the previous volume. The same applies to any fish.

Ai-yaki　　　Needlefish, barracuda, Japanese halfbeak and similar fish
　　　　　　are filleted, bones removed, egg white applied to the flesh side,
　　　　　　two pieces pressed together, salted and grilled.
　　　　　　Trim the edges and corners, then cut in any desired manner.

Kotori-yaki　What is now called sparrow-style grilled crucian carp
　　　　　　However, rather than small crucian carp, it is good to use
　　　　　　four to five-inch crucian carp, butterflied from the back and grilled.

Suki-yaki　　Wild geese, ducks and similar fowl, marinated in seasoned soy sauce,
　　　　　　place an old plow over the fire, arrange citron peel
　　　　　　at front and back, and grill the birds on the plow.
　　　　　　Good to eat when the color has changed.

Uba-yaki　　Eel, pike conger, needlefish, offshore needlefish and similar fish
　　　　　　cut long and skewered on small skewers for grilling.
　　　　　　Recently, people think uba-yaki originated from eel preparation,
　　　　　　but this is not so. Uba-yaki comes from the foothills of Mount Yoshino
　　　　　　in Kii Province, where cherry bark is peeled and sold
　　　　　　clamped in split bamboo skewers. This cherry bark is called kaba,
　　　　　　so the name uba-yaki comes from the resemblance to this shape.
　　　　　　Therefore, any fish prepared in this manner can properly be called uba-yaki.

Twenty-nine: Same-dōfu (Shark Tofu)　　Drain tofu well of water, add kudzu powder, grind well, and quickly stir-fry with oil and soy sauce. Make it like the Thunder tofu from number ten in the previous volume. ○Separately, stir-fry eggplant in oil, add dashi as usual, and scatter the above stir-fried tofu on top. Use both while hot. ○Serve with roughly chopped white scallions, powdered red pepper, and grated daikon radish.

Thirty: Ō-chikuwa-dōfu (Large Bamboo Ring Tofu)　　Small and medium-sized chikuwa tofu are commonly made everywhere, but a whole large chikuwa cannot be grilled using ordinary methods. ○Wrap one piece in cloth mesh, round off the corners to make it rod-shaped [diagram], insert a round wooden core in the center, and grill while rotating in a roasting pan. Season according to preference. Number eighty-four, Oribe tofu, uses this method but without making a hole through the center.

Thirty-one: Premium Furofuki　　Steam Tennoji turnips until very soft and tender, then generously pour over them an ankake sauce containing finely cut tofu simmered with kudzu starch, and add ground sanshō pepper. The tofu should be simmered with soy sauce and kudzu starch. Warm the serving bowl beforehand. Raku-ware lidded tea bowls work well.

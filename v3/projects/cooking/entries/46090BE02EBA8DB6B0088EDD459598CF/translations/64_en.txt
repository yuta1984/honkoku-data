can be cut very finely.

○There is also a new method for making finely cut tofu using a push-through device. The push-through devices that existed until now were the same as those for making kanten jelly, as described in the previous volume "Hundred珍." This new method involves pulling toward oneself. This is one innovation, and the tofu remains on the base board while being cut neatly.

When inserting the tofu, it should be cut and inserted at a position about three-tenths toward the front. It should be pulled smoothly while dipping in hot water. Rushing is not good. One should look at the diagram and think about it.

There are shops that manufacture and sell this device. The size should be about large enough to hold tofu cut into six pieces.

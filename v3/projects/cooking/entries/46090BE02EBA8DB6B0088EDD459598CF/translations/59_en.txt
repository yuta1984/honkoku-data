Miscellaneous Tales of Tofu

○There is a dish called "Utsuho Tofu" (hollow tofu). It is said to have received an imperial name during some emperor's reign, though it is unclear which one. The current preparation method is not well known.

○The dish where crumbled tofu is simmered with kuzu starch sauce and beaten eggs are poured over it is called "Oboro-ni" (misty simmering). Since there are many dishes of this type, they are not included in this main volume.

○Number two from the previous hundred collection, "Pheasant-grilled": Freshly grilled dengaku dipped in raw chili pepper and soy sauce is called "Jibu Tofu." It is named after the "jibu" sound made when the hot grilled tofu is dipped.

○Number five from the previous collection, "Hanpen Tofu," is called "Catfish Crumble."

○Number forty-seven from the previous collection, "Potato-topped," is called "Light Snow."

○The "Buried Tofu" that appeared in number ninety-eight from the previous collection, "Snow-melting Rice," is called "Under the Snow." All of these are names from ancient times. They should have been recorded in the previous hundred collection, but were accidentally forgotten, so I record them here now for the benefit of enthusiasts.

○Tofu will always curdle if cooked even slightly too long. If cooked with kuzu starch liquid, it will not curdle. ○If cooked together with fish or meat, it will not curdle due to the fish oils. ○White lye water

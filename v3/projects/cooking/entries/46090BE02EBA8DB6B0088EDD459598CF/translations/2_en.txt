The ground paste (soy milk) flows into basins and jars, steam from the great cauldron rises buoyantly, small bubbles
The hot water swirls around, after a while clear waves turn over, sitting and watching snow flowers pile up white
Blue salt dissolves into liquid, bittern like crimson wax sends up smoky soot, gleaming as it is refined
Cut large pieces like white jade with Kungo (famous sword), boiled and fried to suit my palate
Not fearing that old teeth might break, what need is there for steamed pork? Even sages pitied human milk
Like ten thousand coins for one full meal, these words are no jest

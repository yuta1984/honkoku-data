Adding a little white lye water when cooking prevents curdling. This is the alkaline solution used by processed fish cake makers for their dipping sauce. This removes the nigari (bittern). Once the nigari is removed, it will never curdle.

○When tofu and matsutake mushrooms are cooked together and well-seasoned, they can be deliciously appreciated. The same is true in China. A poem by a person named Tei Kyonan from the Yuan dynasty goes:
"Head shining bright, legs like nails, only suitable with tofu and spinach,
Buddha saw this and laughed heartily, boiling to death so many wandering monks."
This appears in the book "Sōmokushi" by Yōshiki.

○It goes without saying that those who prefer tofu avoid extravagance and make it their frugal daily vegetable. For elderly people with weak teeth or those who have lost their teeth, no matter how many delicious delicacies there may be, it is difficult to eat them just by looking and smelling, and even if they force themselves to eat, it is hard to appreciate the flavor. Recently there are mortar-making methods for filial piety, but it seems difficult to obtain the true taste from these as well. Only tofu can be a delicious food that even the most aged person without a single tooth can regularly enjoy, can it not? Today's Japanese preparation method differs from the tofu described in herbal medicine texts, being most pure and white.

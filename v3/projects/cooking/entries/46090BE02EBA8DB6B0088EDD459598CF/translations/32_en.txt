Sixty-three: Red Tofu　　Its preparation method is a family secret and is not transmitted to the world.

Sixty-four: True Tofu　　Remove moisture from tofu and sprinkle with salt. In hot weather, leave for about three hours; in winter, leave in a warm place for a full day and night. Then crumble by hand and stir-fry in oil, similar to recipe ten "Thunder Tofu" from the previous volume. ○Serve with grated daikon radish, hot peppers, and chopped white scallions. This creates yet another distinct flavor.

Sixty-five: Fermented Tofu　　Add koji to white rice wine and grind well in a mortar, then add red koji (which is an imported item) and powdered Japanese pepper. If red koji is difficult to obtain, it's acceptable to omit it. Cut the "pressed tofu" from recipe fifteen of the previous volume into medium-sized dice, coat with salt until the saltiness becomes mild, then pickle in the above wine mixture for over twenty days.

Sixty-six: Same method　　Add a little soy sauce to the moromi (fermented mash) and finely chop yuzu peel to mix in. ○Cut pressed tofu into large dice and coat with salt—the proportion being three to four gō of salt per ten chō of tofu. Place in a jar for seven to eight days, then remove, steam, and let cool. Pickle this in the above moromi for over twenty days.

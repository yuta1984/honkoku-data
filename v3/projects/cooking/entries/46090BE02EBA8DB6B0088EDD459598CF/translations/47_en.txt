Four: Noto Ground Tofu　　　This is a specialty of a place called Tatsuruhama in Noto. Essentially, while in the three capitals (Kyoto, Osaka, Edo) they grind with stone mills, in that region they grind with mortar and pestle, making tofu little by little, so it has a fine texture and is exceptionally good

Five: Sesame Tofu　　　Grind white sesame well, put in a cotton bag and strain with water, dissolve high-quality kuzu starch and mix together, remove excess water and put in square containers, steam when it begins to set. Keep submerged in water. The proper ratio is about 5 go of sesame to 1 sho of kuzu starch

Thirty-eight: Taihei Dengaku　　Prepare a large brazier measuring one ken square, fill it with blazing charcoal fire, sharpen the ends of dengaku skewers, coat the dengaku with miso, prepare four new tatami mats, and densely stick the dengaku skewers into them, standing them around the large brazier. The dengaku should be positioned about 2 shaku 4-5 sun above the fire. All people fill their bellies and enjoy themselves - this variety of entertainment and abundant food and drink is proof of a peaceful reign. Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years!
　　The dengaku arrows cry out high in the spring of our lord's reign

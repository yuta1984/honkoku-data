Seventy-nine: "Fool's Boil" Tofu　　Use proportions of two sho of sake per one block of tofu, soak overnight, and boil down the next day. Make kudzu starch sauce with grated fresh ginger. ○Nanking lidded tea bowls with phoenix patterns and such are good.

Eighty: Zen Tofu　　Arrange grilled tofu tightly in a flat pot. When the quantity is large, it's fine to layer them on top of each other. Place fukusa miso thickly on top until the tofu is completely hidden, and simmer over low heat for more than half a day without adding water. If it seems about to burn, add small amounts of sake, salt, or thin soy sauce repeatedly. ○Scoop up both the miso and tofu together to serve in bowls. Sprinkle with ground sansho pepper. ○This is a seasoning method used exclusively by a sect of Soto Zen Buddhism. ○The preparation is quite similar to the Tea Ceremony Tofu from entry sixty-three in the previous volume.

Scoop an appropriate amount with a metal spoon and serve, adding spicy seasonings. ○There is an egg tofu in recipe twenty-six of the previous volume, but this is different from that one.

Sixty: Genji Tofu　　Cut into large dice, roll around in a bamboo colander to round off the corners, lightly oil a confectionery pan (just barely enough), roll and grill, then make miso-korogashi with mustard vinegar and red miso.

Sixty-one: Ominaeshi (Maiden Flower) Dengaku　　Make as grilled tofu with pepper and soy sauce marinade, then sprinkle steamed millet grains on top before serving.
　　　　In recipe thirty-nine, the method that doesn't use millet is called "millet tofu," while now the one that uses millet is called "haisho" (maiden flower). This is truly the refined taste of connoisseurs. Both in appearance and flavor, it's a remarkable delicacy that is not inferior.

Sixty-two: Ayame (Iris) Tofu　　Wrap tofu in cloth and squeeze out water, mix with equal parts of raw wheat gluten, wrap again in cloth and steam, then cut into any desired shape and simmer in soy sauce, sake, and salt, topped with wasabi miso. ○The recipe for wasabi miso can be found in the previous volume's recipe eighty-two for tea tofu.

The deity had four divine children born
These are the seven generations of heavenly deities, the beginning of humanity
First　　　　　Amaterasu Omikami
Second　　　　Masaka-akatsu-kachihayahi-amenooshihomimi-no-mikoto
Third　　　　Ninigi-no-mikoto
Fourth　　　　Hohodemi-no-mikoto
Fifth　　　　Ugayafukiaezu-no-mikoto
These are the deities of the solar lineage. In the four continents of Mount Sumeru there are four seasons. Though the four seasons accumulate to form a year, the four times do not change - these are the three bodies of Dharma, Reward, and Response. They are the source of compassion. Compassion and honesty are divine manifestations.

Above are the Heaven of Sorrow and Heaven of Great Sorrow, below are water-cycle disasters and wind-cycles. Even now, there is no place that escapes the benevolent grace of Amaterasu Omikami, the Moon deity, and the Emperor. Though this all speaks of the governance of a single Mount Sumeru, the mountains and rivers mentioned above are the same matter. Thus the Eight Great Dragon Kings bestow even the moisture of rivers from the eight great seas to humanity.

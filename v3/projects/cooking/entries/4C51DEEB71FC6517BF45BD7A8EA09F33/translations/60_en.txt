Next, make as shown and cut thinly. Use a pipe stem on the palm of your hand to create a curved hollow in the center, then soak in water.

For the center pistils, cut the root portion of parsley or mitsuba stems and use upside down.

Diagram of Finished Plum

Make a hole in the branch and insert the red pepper stem.

For buds, also use red pepper calyxes, preferably shaped into bud form using chestnuts. Attach branches using mountain tree branches.

○Cherry Blossom Instructions

As mentioned before, make petals using chestnuts. Place on palm and use the spine of a knife to create vertical curves, then soak in water.

Five petals for regular cherry blossoms, up to ten for double cherry blossoms. Use red pepper calyxes for the base.

Insert into this area with bamboo pegs.

Like the previous plum method, also insert branches and cut parsley or mitsuba stems for pistils like the plum.

Cherry branches are best for branches. If unavailable, use any similar-looking branch.

○For these petals, add a little red to water and soak to create cherry blossom color.

For leaves, use Japanese photinia or nandina leaves. However, tightly bound red leaves are best.

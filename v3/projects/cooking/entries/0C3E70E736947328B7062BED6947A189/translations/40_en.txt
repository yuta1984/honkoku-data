　　Same method　Take one shō of high-quality white glutinous rice, pound it into flour,
sift it finely, add one monme of sansho pepper powder and three gō of red miso well

steam well and pound together, make the rice flour into kneading flour and spread thinly,
cut when slightly hardened. If it becomes too ball-like,
it is good to use just enough that no water needs to be added.

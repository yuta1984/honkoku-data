Karashi-zu (mustard vinegar) is also good.
　　　　○Thinly Sliced Fresh Sea Cucumber
One: Split sea cucumber into two or three pieces, slice as thinly as possible, dress with irizake (seasoned sake),
　discard that irizake, pour fresh irizake over it again, and
　dress once more - this will make it refreshing. Add wasabi
　and top with katsuobushi flakes. However, if you rinse quickly with lukewarm water,
　the sliminess will be removed and it becomes refreshing, resulting in a good finish.
　　　　○Small Sea Bream Vinegar Dish
One: Prepare the same way as commonly done. However, grill the backbone of sea bream
　over distant fire so as not to burn it, and when the surface
　turns golden brown, pick off the flesh attached to the bones
　with bamboo chopsticks, chop finely, and grind well
　in a mortar. Adding this makes the flavor even better.
　△Types of Kamaboko

【Left Page】
　　　　○Kamaboko
One: It is bad to mix with either sake or dashi -
　it becomes loose and watery. In summer, thin it with water.
　It is also bad to add salt and grind it beforehand.
　Prepare it like kaki-dai, and when grilling, mix in well-ground salt
　and grill as is. When kamaboko crumbles into pieces after grilling,
　it's because salt was mixed in beforehand.
　　　　○Squid Kamaboko
One: Grind sea bream well, cut squid into cubes, slice as thinly as
　possible, grind well to make two colors in equal parts, add one-tenth
　portion of mountain yam, thin with hot water, add a little irizake, and grill
　well starting from the board side. If the fire reaches the top,
　leave it as is. If the fire doesn't reach the top,
　grill from the top side. It's best to use while still warm.

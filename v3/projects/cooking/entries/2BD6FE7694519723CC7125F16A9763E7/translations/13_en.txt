1. White glutinous rice - 1 shō　Roughly crush and break, steam like ordinary
　sticky rice, and let cool completely
1. Kōji - 1 shō　High-quality kōji made from non-glutinous white rice
1. Water - 1 shō
　Add about one-third sake to this. Alternatively, make 1 shō with 5 gō sake and 5
　gō water. Soak the kōji in the above water
　overnight, and the next day rub it with moderate
　strength so the "flowers" fall off well. Similarly, rub until even
　the rice bran on the surface of the kōji rice
　falls off. Then strain and discard the kōji, and ferment
　the sticky rice in that liquid. This amazake is best
　made during the cold season. When ready, put in a pot and boil well, then
　put in a jar - it will keep until next summer.
　Boiled sake becomes hard, so when consuming, dilute with water

　and warm it. You can also make it fresh each time.
　It keeps longer than ordinary amazake.

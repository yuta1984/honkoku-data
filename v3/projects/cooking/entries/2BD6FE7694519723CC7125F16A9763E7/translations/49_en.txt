　　○Method for Removing Salt
One: When removing salt from any pickled foods for Buddhist vegetarian cooking, if you mix a little astringent liquid in the water, the salt will come out well and quickly. This is an exceptional method. When there is no astringent water or in urgent situations, you can put persimmon leaves in the water and it works well. The salt removal becomes swift.

　　○Method for Pickled Matsutake Mushrooms
One: If you pickle grilled matsutake without boiling as described below, the fragrance will not be lost and it will be good. At this time, pickle with grilled salt.

One: Cut off the stone base from matsutake buds and boil them as well as possible. For opened ones, boil the caps and stems separately to the same degree of doneness, drain well and cool thoroughly. Place very white salt at the bottom of a tub, arrange the matsutake on top so they don't rub against each other, then sprinkle salt until the matsutake are covered, placing fresh pine needles here and there. Pickle layer by layer up to the top like this. Make four holes in the bottom of the tub with an awl to drain the salty liquid. If salt water accumulates, the matsutake will spoil.

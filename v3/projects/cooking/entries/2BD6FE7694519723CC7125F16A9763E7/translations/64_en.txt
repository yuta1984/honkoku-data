One: During the cold season, take only the white parts of seaweed and
wash them well many times. Put them in a large kettle and add

and leave it, it will solidify. If there are dregs, boil it
many times. Cut the solidified tokoroten into pieces about
three to four inches long and two bu thick, and on a very cold night
put it outside and leave it overnight, and it will freeze solid

then pour the broth over it. If you put it in a pot, it will dissolve.

　　　○Method for Steamed Bamboo Shoots
One: Use fresh bamboo shoots, whether from madake or hachiku bamboo,
with the skin on, standing them upright in a large kettle. Put ground rice bran
in the kettle and pack it so the bamboo shoots won't burn. Fill the kettle
about eight-tenths full with water, cover the kettle with a tub as a lid,
making sure no steam escapes, and maintain a gentle fire
for two to three hours, steaming and simmering them.

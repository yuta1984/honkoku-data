One: Small sardines smaller than tazukuri are good. Hold the tip of the tail and scrape backwards -
　the scales, intestines, and head will all come off. Wash this very well
　and dress with karashi-zu (mustard vinegar) mixed with salt.
　　　　○Namasu that keeps well when dressed (does not spoil)
One: Dress any fish with only salt and vinegar, and
　leave it soaked in that vinegar - even after half a day passes, it will not
　spoil at all. When serving, discard some of the vinegar from plenty to a little,
　add plenty of sake, and sometimes it's good to add water as well.
　Also, you can take the fish out of the vinegar
　and dress it with sake alone.
　△Types of Sashimi
　　　　○Bonito Sashimi
One: Prepare bonito by pouring hot water over it as usual, or use it as is,
　and make a broth by adding just a little salt to aged sake.

　Pour this broth over the fish, let it sit briefly, then remove and serve.
　Also, if you soak it in sake as described above, the fish will not
　spoil for about two days.
　　　　○Sweetfish Sashimi
One: Take sweetfish of one, two, or three sun in length, remove the heads, fillet into three pieces,
　and without discarding the center bone, add a little salt and
　wash with it. Serve with tade-su miso (smartweed vinegar miso) or karashi-su miso (mustard vinegar miso).
　When filleting into three pieces, you can remove the center bone
　without cutting off the tail section.
　　　　○Carp Mizuzukuri
One: Use carp without roe, slice very thinly, add a little salt to freshly drawn water,
　wash two or three times until the carp flesh
　becomes firm from washing, squeeze out the water until the flesh contracts,
　then it's good to add vinegar to irizake as well.

　　Abalone Shell-grilled
Cut abalone to a good size, add ginkgo nuts, chestnuts, Chinese yam, water dropwort, arrowhead, and other ingredients, simmer in light tamari soy sauce with sake and bonito to make it somewhat sweet, then transfer to the abalone shell. It's even better if grilled in the shell.

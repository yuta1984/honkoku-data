　　　　○Method for Cooking Abalone Until Tender
One: Remove the shell from female abalone, take out the intestines, and wash well. Pound carefully up to the ears so the abalone doesn't break. Lay kelp in a pot, place the abalone on top, use the shell as a lid, and simmer in miso soup.
One: Mix water and sake in equal parts with thin bag miso, adding enough liquid to cover the abalone shell. After simmering about halfway, the miso broth will reduce to about the consistency of paste miso. Remove at that point - it's good with salt sprinkled on top, with kudzu soy sauce, or as is.
　　　　○Salt Fish Mixed Salad
One: Salt sea bream or salt cod work well. Remove the salt and prepare like sashimi, then wash with water. Shave bonito flakes coarsely, mix together, and add a little vinegar and a little water to the seasoned sake.

　　　　○Mixed Salad
One: Make various dried fish into shavings and mix with vegetarian ingredients. Mix water into vegetarian seasoned sake, add vinegar, and mix like namasu. Vegetarian seasoned sake is better than fish-based seasoned sake. If the seasoned sake is sweet, don't add vinegar.
　　　　○Whale Cuisine
One: Cut fresh whale into appropriate sizes and simmer once in sake like sake-braised cooking. Then discard the sake and add to miso. Even with salt whale, remove the salt first, then braise in sake as described above. If the salt whale is red in color, cut off the top part.

　　　○Method for Preserving Eggplant
One: Using some kind of tub, put persimmon tannin in the tub, making it thoroughly
wet, fit a basket lid,
and make many holes in the lid. 《Marginal note: However, just large enough for eggplant stems to pass through》
Then take prime eggplants without blemishes,
cut them leaving long stems. After that, insert
the eggplant stems through the holes, ensuring the stems are well
soaked in the tannin, place a cover on top,
and store in a place where snow and frost won't reach.
They will keep indefinitely without color change.

One: Take unblemished eggplants from the first harvest, and soak them in one
sho of heated oil 《Marginal note: thirty if small, twenty if large》 as described above.
They will keep indefinitely. When cooking,
boil them in hot water before use.
The remaining oil can also be used.

　　　○Method for Preserving Spring Plums
One: White sugar 《Marginal note: one sake cup》
One: Aged sake 《Marginal note: one finest sake cup》
Knead the sugar well with the sake. If insufficient,
prepare any amount using the same proportions.
Then pick spring plums while still quite green,
and place them in the kneaded sugar until the plums are completely
covered. They will stay green indefinitely and have good
flavor. 《Marginal note: However, seal the containers well, otherwise they will change color》

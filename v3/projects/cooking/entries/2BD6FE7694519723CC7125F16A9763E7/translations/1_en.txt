Preface to the Comprehensive Collection of Daily Cooking Recipes
Confucius said, "If the food is not properly prepared, do not eat it; if proper seasonings are not available, do not eat it." These words of the sage are truly wise. Indeed, the preparation of food and drink is an urgent matter in people's daily lives, and should not be forgotten in any household. As such, one poison can give rise to many diseases, while the efficacy of one medicine can cure many ailments. Therefore, one must know the way of cooking. I have long been devoted to this way, seeking far and wide to collect secret teachings and oral traditions that have not been transmitted to the world.

○Method for Making Soba (Buckwheat Noodles)
One portion: Examine buckwheat flour very carefully, then knead. Drop a little well-boiled hot water onto the flour, making it crumbly, knead to proper consistency, then knead with water to good consistency. Roll out in the usual manner and boil. When well-boiled, put water in a tub, quickly rinse, and place in a strainer. Then put either the boiling water or plain hot water in the tub, add the soba noodles, place the strainer directly on top, and pour well-boiled water from above. Steam with the vapor from both the water put in first and the water poured from above later. When the sliminess is removed and it begins to dry, it is very good.

Flatten to about five bu thick. If you sift rice bran and use it as dusting flour, it won't stick to your hands and stretches well. Then boil as usual. In the hot water, the rice bran portion falls away cleanly, there is no smell of rice bran at all. Generally, because dusting flour makes the water sticky, even when soba noodles are made, they become bad unless washed many times, but if rice bran is used as dusting flour, the water doesn't become sticky at all, so if you rinse the soba noodles two or three times, they're ready quickly, and therefore don't stretch.

○Method for Boiling Soba Noodles to Keep for a Long Time
One portion: When boiling soba noodles, add a little sugar and five walnuts to about one load of boiling water, boil as usual, then remove. Wash in lukewarm water, place in strainer and pour water over, then store in a container and they won't spoil at all.

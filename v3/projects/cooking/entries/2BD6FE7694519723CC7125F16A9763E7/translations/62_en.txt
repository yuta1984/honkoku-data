One: For winter melon, scrape the inner hard parts well. Also scrape
the green parts well. However, it's better to leave a little
green color remaining. Make it to the thickness of pickled melon, chop it and
soak it in sake, then it will shrink and become firm,
with no difference from ordinary melon. Then
prepare the dish in any way as desired.
It's just as good as ordinary melon with no difference.

　　　　Method for Preserving Pickled Melon
One: Split the melon into four parts, remove the seeds and such, wash well,
expose to wind and dry the moisture.
One: Add a little salt to tofu lees,
when cut and examined, it should be salty enough to form
dumplings. Then sprinkle the lees in one layer,
and arrange the melons on top so they don't rub against each other.

Arrange the melons, then sprinkle lees on top again and place melons,
layering gradually in this manner. Cover with a lid to prevent drafts.
The color will remain green indefinitely, preserved as if
in season.

　　　○Method for Preserving Persimmons
One: Whether wood-practice persimmons or wood-rough persimmons, pick them while still green and not yet
ripe, when the astringency is strong. Wrap them well in
persimmon leaves so the persimmons are not visible, tie with straw,
then put them in straw bundles,
tying each persimmon individually top and bottom so the persimmons don't
rub against each other when wrapping. The bundles should be neither too thick
nor too thin, arranged so they're not visible above the persimmon skin,
and hung in shade.
Especially avoid places where rain and dew can reach.

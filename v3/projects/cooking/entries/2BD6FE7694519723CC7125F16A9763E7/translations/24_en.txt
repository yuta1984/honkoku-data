1. When sake lees from winter are pressed again in spring, some sweetness emerges and it becomes cloudy. Use 1 to of that sake and 3 sho of salt (however, Harima salt is poor quality; Kishu salt is good). Put these two ingredients in a pot and boil down 1 to of sake until it becomes 8 sho, then put it directly into a jar or barrel. After thirty days, it becomes fine soy sauce.

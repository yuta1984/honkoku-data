　pound and crush them, then put into cotton bags. Then put water in a tub, soak the bags in that water and knead them out to make white water. Knead out many times. This is to extract all the kudzu attached to the roots. After kneading out well, strain that white water seven or eight times through cotton, cloth, or other fine material, and discard the small amount of residue that comes out. Then repeatedly change the white water in this tub, and when you look at the tub bottom, soil or black sediment remains. Remove and discard this many times. The better you remove this sediment, the better the result. When no more soil sediment settles at the bottom, strain the white water about three times through silk. This is also to remove soil sediment. After straining well, put the white water in a tub like a half-barrel.

　Put it in and let it sit for about three days. Make about three spouts in the side of the half-barrel tub, and when the water on top becomes clear, pull out the spout plugs and discard the upper water. When it all settles in the half-barrel, the kudzu that has settled to the bottom will stand up. Discard all the water and take out the kudzu that settled to the bottom. Make something like koji lids, divide the kudzu finely on them, and dry in good weather for about twenty days. If there is even a little moisture, the color of the kudzu will become poor.

1. Cold-weather kudzu is made this way only during the cold season.

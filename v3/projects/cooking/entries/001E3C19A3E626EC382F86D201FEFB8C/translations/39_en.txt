(35) Salted Daikon Rice Porridge - Preparation Method

First, peel the daikon and grate it coarsely in the manner of grating wasabi.
Add this daikon starting from cold water, and when it has boiled once, add roasted salt.
Wash the rice thoroughly with water and add an appropriate amount. Having too much
rice is also not good. When it has boiled two or three times, remove from heat.
It has the aroma of daikon and makes a refreshing porridge.
This is especially good for hangovers from drinking. It is also good for later course dishes.

(36) Kawachi Moriguchi Thin Daikon - Miso Pickling and Sake Lees Pickling Method

First, when this daikon comes out fresh in season, dry it for about two days on good sunny days, sprinkle with an appropriate amount of salt, and pickle it along the direction of the stems. However, the pressing stone should be light.
If it gets crushed, it's no good. Also, pickling in fresh rice bran miso is exceptionally
good. Now, after about a month, take it out, wash with water, let it drip,
and let it air dry in the wind for a while. Then add about three go of salt to one sho of sake lees,
mix well and pickle. However, sprinkle a little salt. Layer by layer,
spread the lees, press the daikon firmly, and cover tightly.
For miso pickling, use home-prepared miso with sprinkled salt. This is only for
the Moriguchi thin daikon. Cover the mouth of the container well with paper. However, for pickling other
daikon and turnips, follow the same method. Add salt in appropriate amounts.

The use of daikon dates back to the age of the gods, and through the passage of years and seasons up to the fifth year of Tenmei, we have revised and recorded these years. Even in vegetarian cuisine, daikon is the foremost ingredient for celebratory occasions. Generally speaking, for a complete meal service, even including sake accompaniments, everything can be arranged using only daikon. Additionally, we record methods for medicinal rice soup with daikon, daikon rice porridge, dried leaf medicinal tea preparation, quick pickling, and simple appetizers, among many other varieties. These should be consulted in the table of contents.

Now, the method for quick-simmered daikon: cut the daikon lengthwise, in rounds, or circular cuts - all are acceptable. Toast black sesame seeds, wrap them lightly in cloth, and place at the bottom of the pot. Add daikon to the pot with water, simmer for about three boilings, add a little sake, cover tightly with a lid, then add soy sauce or make it with miso - furofuki style is also excellent. This cooking method is a secret technique that can be completed even while rice is being prepared.

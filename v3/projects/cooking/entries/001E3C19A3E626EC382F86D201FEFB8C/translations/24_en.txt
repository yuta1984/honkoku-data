(24) Hishu Specialty Shi-maki Boiled Daikon Method
《This is from a place called Miyazaki under Obi domain in Hyuga Province, and is a specialty of this place used in Shinto rituals》

Cut the daikon leaving the leaf base, and wrap with raw shi (dried abalone). This is abalone. To peel abalone into noshi strips, peel one shell into one strip of noshi. With this, wrap and tie the daikon tightly from base to tip, then boil in soy sauce mixed with water. This is a grilled dish for Shinto rituals at this place. Cut appropriately and serve to guests. The flavor is exceptional. If doing this in other provinces, soak the noshi in water for one day and night, and it will separate into individual strips and become thick like fresh abalone. Use this to wrap the daikon tightly and cook. Adding a little sake is better. For drinking accompaniments, this is especially good.

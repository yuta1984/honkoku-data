First, this uses kiri-boshi (dried strips) from Miyashige in Bishu Province. These also come in high, medium, and low grades.

Then cut it finely, squeeze out the water thoroughly, grind three-year miso or Bishu red miso well, toast white sesame seeds and grind them well, adding plenty, also grate wasabi, add a little sake, grind together, then add the daikon and mix.

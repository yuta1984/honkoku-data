Now, to cook the aforementioned dried daikon and dried turnips, cut them and put them in hot water to rinse briefly, then put them in hot cooking broth and cook them, and both dried daikon and dried turnips will cook quickly. However, it is not good to start cooking them in cold water. Now, as proof of the bountiful years throughout the land, various provinces have daikon and turnips in all four seasons.

However, sprinkle a little sake while rolling. Tie the top with straw rope and put it in a steamer.

Large daikon radish is offered. When there is no daikon, radish sprouts (kaiwari) are offered instead.
This is detailed in the Ogasawara school. Also, when taking mizuna seeds to various places and sowing them, only radish sprouts and hollyhock grow, but no greens. Therefore, perhaps because the capital is the seat of celebrations. From the beginning of the Kamo Hollyhock Festival until Tenmei 5 (1785), it has been approximately 1,142 years. This was during the reign of Emperor Kinmei. At this time, there were great floods throughout the provinces, which led to a great famine. For the first time, the Emperor made a vow to the deity of Kamo, and during the festival, two-leaved hollyhock was offered, prayers were performed, and a festival was held. The hollyhock divine ritual is said to have begun from this time.

Furthermore, daikon has one hundred flavors of efficacy. First, it is foremost among ceremonial foods, and thirty-two varieties dispel impurities before one's eyes. There are twelve articles for men and twenty articles for women. These twelve articles dispel impurities of men and women before the gods, and there are festivals with the same twelve articles. Also, six articles concern knowing the virtue before one's eyes. Also, from the winter solstice, by the soil attached to daikon leaves, there are six articles for knowing the good and bad fortune of the spring equinox of the following year. Also, two articles are charms against household thieves. Also, twenty-eight articles concern various medicinal virtues of daikon. Moreover, the leaves also have various leaf efficacies.

【Ingredient】
Eel
　Mountain river eels have strong oil, tough skin, and poor taste
　However, making kabayaki (grilled eel) is a common practice
　Or　making kabayaki with sansho pepper miso
　　　　would be superior to soy sauce

【Cooking Method】
Vinegared dish plate (namasu-zara) 《Peel the skin and cut thinly lengthwise to use as namasu ingredients｜Also combine in live arrangement　However, the theory of eel-vinegar poison is false》
Main soup 《With red miso, crumbled tofu and eel peeled and cut into cylinders｜or torn and cut to appropriate size》

【Ingredient】
Catfish
　Making this into kabayaki is also a common practice
　Peel the skin and make into thick red miso soup to serve
　in flat bowls　With dried sansho pepper

【Cooking Method】
Kamaboko 《Take the flesh from namasu fish, pound and knead thoroughly, mix in｜egg white to set it》
　　However, if too little egg is added, it won't set　Also when fish
　　is out of season and difficult to set, add a little high-grade wheat flour

　◦Salmon ◦Trout ◦Ina ◦Tanago ◦Sai ◦Menada ◦Young needlefish ◦River shrimp
　◦Long-armed shrimp ◦Marsh crab ◦Ugoi ◦Carp ◦Crucian carp　All these types are river fish
　but depending on the river they may not exist, and are not in mountain streams　Moreover, the above types
　all had their preparation methods listed in the previous volume, so they are omitted here

【Ingredient】
Tojō　Mud turtle (soft-shell turtle)
　These two items have extremely many preparation methods, and also rare combinations and
　usage methods, but since many people
　dislike them, for now
　their preparation methods are omitted and not discussed

◦Pheasant ◦Copper pheasant ◦Jay　Besides these, various birds and small birds are used in mountain homes but
all their combination methods already appear in the previous and later volumes
◦Eggs　Same as above　However, since eggs have many preparation methods, a volume devoted only to eggs will be published later

　　　Clever drinking appetizers　That is, the section on sake accompaniments

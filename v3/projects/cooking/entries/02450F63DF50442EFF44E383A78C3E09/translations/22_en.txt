Freshwater Fish Cuisine Section

【Ingredient】
Yamame (Cherry Trout)
　A fish found in the rapids of mountain streams. Some are larger than ayu (sweetfish). It is delicious.
　　　Even in mountainous homes and other places where fresh ingredients are readily available, there are river fish, so I include this section.

【Cooking Example】
Medium Plate
　Salt-grilled, grilled with sansho pepper miso, grilled with egg soy sauce,
　or kneaded with red miso and sake, then cook the yamame through
　and simmer to serve.

【Cooking Example】
Namasu Plate
　Fillet the fish and prepare it, slice white melon into thin strips,
　arrange fresh and use grilled miso balls as accompaniment.
　　　However, mix mustard seed into the miso balls, pound well, form into balls and grill.

【Ingredient】
Young Ayu (Sweetfish)
　The preparation method when grown large is the same as yamame. Here I present
　the method for when they are young.

【Cooking Example】
Clear Soup
　Ayu about the size of willow leaves are good. Serve about two fish.
　Accompaniments include wheat gluten balls, horsetail shoots, pine greens, enoki mushrooms and
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　similar items as appropriate.

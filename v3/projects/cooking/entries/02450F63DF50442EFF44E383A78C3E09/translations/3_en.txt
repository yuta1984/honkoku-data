Items like salted matsutake mushrooms are commonly sold, so they are not included here. I only record the traditional methods for preparing unusual preserved foods.

1. For appetizers (tsumami-zakana), when nothing is prepared or when running short of time late at night, I present one or two types of quick dishes to help.

1. I will generally list the names of regional specialties such as salted fish paste (shiokara), salt-pickled items, and dried foods.

As an appendix, I include Ōbaku cuisine, fucha cuisine, and shippoku cuisine preparation methods. Though there are many dishes, since the matter becomes complex, I will present the basics and teach their procedures. However, by combining items from the various dishes in the previous two volumes and following this format, one can create countless variations.

△That is to say, the dishes whose preparation methods appear at the end of this volume are only those not covered in the previous volumes. For those whose methods have already been presented, I defer to the previous two volumes and omit them here.

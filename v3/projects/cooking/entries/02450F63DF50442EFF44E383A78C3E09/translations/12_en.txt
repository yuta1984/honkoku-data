【Ingredient】
Fresh Mackerel (Sashisaba)
　Noto Province products are considered the finest quality.
　One type: slice thin from the end and layer on a hand-salt plate.
　　　Pouring tade vinegar is also good. Also pour bonito flakes and sake.

【Ingredient】
Salted Sardine
　Also red sardine 《Note: Those from Echigo are called "nagashi"》
　This type is grilled and used frequently nowadays
　for grilled dishes at formal meals, on long plates, etc.

【Cooking Example】
　Large Sake Cup
　Wash well, tear apart, discard head and bones,
　serve with only vinegar poured over grated daikon.

【Ingredient】
Pickled Small Sardines (Hishiko-zuke)
　While this is commonly available, the preparation method is often poor. Here I describe
　the proper method.
　Take fresh medium sardines with salt, wash very well, drain thoroughly,
　press salt bundles into a tub, add the sardines, then place salt straw mats on top
　with light pressing weights for two to three days, then remove and use. The color will be like fresh fish,
　glistening, the fish will not lose weight at all, and the salt will penetrate properly,
　making it extremely delicious. Any combination plating is fine.

For this hishiko pickle, adding koji to make it uniform, together with perilla seeds, ginger, chili peppers, etc.,
with strong and prolonged pressing like nanban-zuke also has good flavor, but
it becomes too salty, and the presentation is also unsightly with the fish pressed flat. Compare this with the hishi-
ko pickle described here to know which is better. However, since teetotalers'
preferences and drinkers' preferences differ, I don't insist this method is best, but
first prepare both versions to try and follow your preference.

【Ingredient】
Salted Bonito
　There are two types: those from Iwaki and lightly salted ones,
　with different preparation methods.
　　　There are also uzuwa and small bonito, but these are inferior grade
　　　with no good uses. Omitted.

【Cooking Example】
Clear Soup
Sake Lees Soup
　Use the finest Iwaki bonito cut into medium pieces, remove flesh, dissolve the finest sake lees
　into the broth and simmer. Cut carrots, burdock root,
　daikon, and taro into medium cubes for ingredients.
　　　Seasonings　Green onion　Chili pepper

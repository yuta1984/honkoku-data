Water Pears (Mizunashi)
　Put water pears well protected from ants into ashes from burned rice hulls, and they will keep for a long time.
　Also, wrapping them in thin astringent paper and pickling them in rice bran miso is very good.

Kumquats
　These can also be preserved well in rice hull ashes.
　Also, if packed in a paulownia box and well covered, they will keep until used once. They won't keep for a second use.

Kunenbo (Nine-year Citrus)
　Wrap well in astringent paper and pickle in rice bran miso.
　Also, if wrapped in their leaves and kept away from wind, they will keep for a short time.

Mandarin Oranges
　Take premium mandarin oranges from Kii Province, sprinkle with straw ash, pour boiling water over them, dry them well, pack in boxes and seal with paste.

Eternal Vinegar (Mannenzu)
　This is a transmitted secret. According to the method, take one masu of good sake, add two pieces of cut rice cake well toasted, put them in the sake, and after about five days it becomes strong vinegar. When using, scoop with a small ladle, and afterward add as much water as was scooped out - it will never run out.

　Besides these there are many more, but this records the general outline.
　However, for cooking preparation it's essential to always store and pickle items such as: perilla seeds, thousand-layer pickle, eggplant koji pickle, mustard pickle, triple pickle, vinegar-pickled eggplant, honey-pickled eggplant, takuan, amber pickle, thunder-dried sake pickle, rolled daikon pickle, rakkyo triple pickle. Furthermore, it's essential to keep on hand items like hoshii (dried cooked rice), kudzu, rice crackers, shimizu rice, yuzu mochi, or mandarin mochi, udon flour, dried sansho pepper, black pepper powder, eggs and such varieties.
　Thus ends the three volumes of cooking in the Sankashu collection. The appendix is recorded below.

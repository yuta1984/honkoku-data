This too is widely known, but here is one innovation. The usual method is to cook with the water content of porridge, and when it is about to be done, drawing out the water is extremely time-consuming. Therefore, from the beginning, put the washed rice in a bamboo strainer, place it directly in the pot, add an appropriate amount of water and cook. When it is about to be done, lift it out, discard the hot water, then return it to the pot and finish cooking by evaporation.

It is well known in the world to thoroughly brew very good tea and cook rice with it using the water content for rice. However, seasoning with salt is poor. For example, for one sho (about 1.8 liters) of rice, add one cup each of soy sauce and sake in a medium cup and cook. The flavor is extraordinary.

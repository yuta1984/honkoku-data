are all acceptable. In all cases, skewer with green bamboo skewers for use.

1. Grilled aku-mame: Thoroughly wash a deep large earthenware vessel, place it firmly
   over charcoal fire and bake for a considerably long time. Separately prepare cooking broth.
   For the combination of simmered dishes, whatever the ingredients, season properly along with other preparations
   and set aside. When serving to guests, heat the aforementioned simmered dish
   and place the fired and cracked earthenware vessel on a plate, spread plenty of raw salt
   on it, then transfer and serve the simmered dish in the earthenware vessel.
   This will foam up about five to six inches and continue
   boiling vigorously for a while. Serve this very quickly to the guests.
   Of course, without metal tongs and fire chopsticks, the preparation becomes difficult. This should be
   understood. The same applies to both fish dishes and vegetarian dishes.

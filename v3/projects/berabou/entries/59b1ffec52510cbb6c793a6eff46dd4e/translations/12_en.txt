The artist Soshiya, tormented by the monsters of the woodblock makers, now had no choice but to push open the storehouse door and tried to escape into the storehouse. Mysteriously, lightning-linked clouds emerged from the storehouse, and the main characters from the original stories - Sakata no Kinpira, Watanabe no Taketsuna, Usui Wakamaru, and Princess Hachikazuki - scattered the monsters by trampling them.

"Namu Sambo! Monsters and metal objects - what unpleasant creatures have appeared! Let's flee quickly!" says General Mashida.

"Pardon me, pardon me! Being trampled like this, my head hurts like the cut surface of a large tree!"

"I've been waiting eagerly for the evil at the door. You there, even if you try your thunder sword imitation, should I let you escape?"

"Ah, how painful! The dorayaki and sweet potato seem to be together even in death. It's karmic retribution - a rotten bond!"

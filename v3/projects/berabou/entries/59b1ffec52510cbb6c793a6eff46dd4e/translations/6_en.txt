Now for the second act, there's sea bream miso soup with
red demons from all directions
A small place that's called Dragon Gate Falls
you see. When thrown into the miso soup
from above come waterfalls from all four directions
The water is just spoken of as an example
[There should be one line at the binding but it's unreadable in this document]
Isn't it miso soup after all? Having set out like this and cried
the place appears to be Maruya's sumo ring
it seems
♪Going around the grafted area two or three times
they threw Hanki-ya about three ken
(roughly 18 feet)

How refreshingly cool that would be!
But the carp's
climbing the hanki - what's
that about? Ehhhh, what are you saying that will perish?

This audience area is what's called
the "cutting curtain" place

If you see a snake's legs
you'll become wealthy,
everyone says, so since I
saw a sea bream's legs,
I wonder if this
digger will become
a rich person
or not

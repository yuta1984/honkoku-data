Nor are they one-eyed monsters

Also
Noble ones
First
The number one
Large tree
The cut stump, thick
Root pancakes, sweet potato
Sea bream miso soup, four dishes, red rice appearance
Mountain intuition, vinegar, confectionery, small sword swallowing mark
Forest birds with long tails, did you see heaven above?
What a tea kettle as chopsticks
Each one
Expressing early spring
Sentiments
Sitting properly
On the tatami floor
Herring roe
Candied sardines
Vinegared burdock root, each one
Tilted their sake cups

Evil thoughts, spoke to his monster subordinates:

"We are all quick-witted, but this stinking layered paper, such an auspicious miso soup does not exist"

"The mouth of the small sword is always amusing, and our navels are indeed boiling tea"

"What a tea kettle, please forgive us"

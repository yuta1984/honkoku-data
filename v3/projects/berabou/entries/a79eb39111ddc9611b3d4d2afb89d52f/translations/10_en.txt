Incense Tea (Kōsen)
　By Baika Takeshi
At the pond's edge, perhaps
Called incense tea,
　　　　they say
New Year's
Spring's elegant touch
　　　　with incense tea
　From a shaker tube

New Year's Day
The pole princess's misty
　First wearing of robes
　　　　beginning
Both the mountain's face
　And the reed-thatched hut on the far side
　　　　　　　too

Year's End
After all, it's lies -
　　　　the year's
Settling accounts hastily
　　　　　　　and
Making do,
　　In bamboo
　Spring
Awaits the wind

Demon-Breaking Bow (Hamayumi)
　By Tenpō Kawanari
First light of day -
　Truly befitting
A warrior's young
　　　　　child
　Today with the demon-breaking bow
　　　Spring mist, indeed

Year's End
The departing year's ridge-top
　Bonito sprinkled with salt
Still called Takasago,
　　　　so
People
Say
　Indeed

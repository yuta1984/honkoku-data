Large Rice Crackers
　by Yamate Hakujin

The taste of these rice crackers is also good,
A golden flower worth a thousand pieces of gold blooming in spring - a precious gift

Well, well!
Rice crackers, ten thousand crackers!
How grateful I am
indeed

Battledore and Shuttlecock
　by Torisorane

Though spring has come
and fallen people have fallen from the veranda,
together we rejoice
in these words on the battledore

Shuttlecock Child
　by Sanri Kitaka

Even if the shuttlecock child
falls from the veranda while playing,
if the fallen person
should be injured,
please forgive us

#4
Oh my! Look at that cleft lip speaking
If you go ahead following the tracks,
shuttlecock child

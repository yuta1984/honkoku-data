Sweet Dew Plum (Kanro-bai)
　By Ōmeshi Kuijin (Great Rice Eater)

Today
　opens
Among New Year's gifts
　the sweet dew plum
How elegant
　　　the guest's
　nose appears
　　　　indeed

Oneself
　　　Sumida Nakakumi
Even oneself
　rejoices with kelp -
　　the first ceremonies
Forming bonds
　　is what this is about

Temari (Hand Ball)
　　By Kawagishi Takatsumi
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten -
　abundantly counting
　　　　the ball
Though we bounce it
　　it never ends,
　　　these long
　　　spring days

【Dialogue】
Excuse me,
Master Kurando,
　　　sir,
Won't you make
　　　the rice
　cheaper?
　　somehow?
Here, here,
The plum's
　　fragrance -
Bring the sweet dew
plums
here!

【Dialogue】
Today the weather
is fine, yes indeed it is.
That's from others -
complaints about
　　the shared seating

Sliced Sansho Pepper
by Makinaga Naouchi

The year-end gift's
bag opening—
with sliced sansho pepper
trying to open it
paper
decorative paper
poem strips

Noon Tassels
by Miso Koshikibu

The returning
spring breath
and fragrance
all at once—
even body hair
stands on end
from such
vinegared noon tassels

【Dialogue】
Today
Magohiko has
gone to
Uemon's
gathering

Please,
for the twelfth day meeting
I shall
attend
Hitonari-kyō should
also come

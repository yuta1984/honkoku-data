These are not garments, and what is called "shinko" is not glutinous rice. Yesterday's "daughter" becomes today's "wife," and haori that transform into children - such things have never been seen even in the monthly ordinances of the Record of Rites. They deceive first-time customers, follow the trail of those who have sold stolen goods and lie in wait, making noses run and turn red. There are the composed faces of customers staying the night, the sleepy faces of morning preparations, the moist atmosphere of the four o'clock dawn, and the spirited daytime play. The courtesans' writing is like independent cursive script - unreadable, and their secret language is like barbarian speech - incomprehensible.

Some are called forth and sent back, despised yet infatuated, while others are favored but hesitant to proceed. The wind of infidelity blows at one's nose tip, while the rain of true feelings falls around one's knees. The customers are of infinite variety, the courtesans infinitely adaptable - truly this is the great spectacle of the pleasure quarters.

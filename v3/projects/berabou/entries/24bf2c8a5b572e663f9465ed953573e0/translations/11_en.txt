《Interlinear note: ○Just now being early autumn with lingering summer heat, various boats ply the river - pleasure boats, long-rope boats, ferry boats and such. Among them appears to be a boat from Aotoya on the Namerikawa river, a single roofed boat tilted slightly, with passengers aboard to enjoy the river breeze. One passenger is Kobayashi no Asahina, about thirty years old, wearing Yuki-striped single garments, having removed his wax-patterned haori and placed it beside him. He is a longtime habitué of Oiso. Another passenger is Saga no Juro, twenty-three or four years old, wearing mogusa-striped Echigo with white undergarment and black gauze haori, holding a fan of brown paper. He is a pleasure quarter customer and a great lover of buckwheat noodles. The third is Danzaburo, older brother of Saga no Juro, dressed the same as Juro}}

Juro: "Hey, Asa-san, that samurai who just passed over Hanamizu Bridge - he's the second son of the estate where that guy used to work."
Asahina: "Hmm, he certainly looked quite grand and martial. Look here, even this fence looks pretty big when you see it like this, doesn't it?"
Danzo: "There are quite a few taboo words on this boat, aren't there? They say 'ashamed' when something like a tea bowl breaks. I tried saying 'hehe' once myself."
Asa: "Old man, how are the ropes these days? {{Interlinear: referring to long ropes}}"
Boatman Kyu: "With all this continuous hot weather, the water's gotten bitter and no good."
Asa: "I suppose so. Oh, it's gotten quite hot again today... hehe-bu"

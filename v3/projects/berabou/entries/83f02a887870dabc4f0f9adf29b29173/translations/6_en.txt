They borrowed the arm of Ibaraki Kannon (the goddess of mercy), but since it had no hair, it was useless. They asked Yokichi, a carpenter from Kanda, to grow hair on it.

"Boar hair is precious these days, so I attached deer hair instead. If it were boar hair, you'd go to Mount Atago; since it's deer hair, please go to in front of Kasuga Shrine."

Yokichi's wife: "Ibaraki, you're over thirty and still clueless!"
"Didn't you fall from Mount Asama?"

"My wife has now grown innocent and carefree."

What was cut off from Tadanori was his right arm. Tadanori coughed a little, but in his great joy, he borrowed a left hand. He wrote tanzaku poetry slips at Sasanami-ya with his left hand, and when people said "This calligraphy is excellent!" and he went to borrow a right hand, they said "We're all loaned out." Thinking "This won't work now," Tadanori wrote the six-character nembutsu with his left hand, and without regard for direction, chanted "This is finished. Namu Amida Butsu."

Regarding this, the arms cut for Moroku's sake - who knows if they've withered by now.

"This looks bad for our reputation. Let's just say it was by an anonymous poet."

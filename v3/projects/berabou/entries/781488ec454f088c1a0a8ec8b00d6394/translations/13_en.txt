The tree stump
And the other monsters—
When Kimpira scolded them and made them submit to reason,
many of the monsters seemed to disappear all at once in a flash, but they left behind two volumes of kusazoshi in the void

revealing
a single line of title.
The three people
found this strange and
opened them to look,
and found that
the tree stump had written
and revealed
an ingenious conception
from the very beginning
in these kusazoshi.
Since publishing them as-is
would not be interesting, we promptly
used them for
this year's new edition
to provide
entertainment
during the spring rains
alone.

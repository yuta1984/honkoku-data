"How pitiful - I want to let them know about the supernatural beings' circumstances."

The three men - the artist, the illustrated book seller, and the woodblock carver - are eager to prepare new publications for the New Year, but lately strange things have been increasing daily in each household, so they discussed among themselves that there must be some reason for it all.
♪"Surely no supernatural beings will appear tonight either. Let's have some sake to lift our spirits, just the two of us."

♪"This is a large cup - if I drink from this, I'll immediately be like the kites and crows of Mount Ikitsuki. Just recently, I was tricked by those supernatural beings into falling into a foul-smelling river. Ever since then, I still have a headache."

♪"I don't know what it is, but my hair has been falling out from the roots. I wonder if it's measles."

【Hand-written in ink】
May what I write remain as a keepsake,
　O traces of my brush,
　　　no matter whose hands
　　may touch them

【The poem on the right is a modified version of the latter half of graffiti commonly found at pilgrimage sites throughout the country: "May what I write remain as a keepsake, O traces of my brush; I wonder in which land I shall become dust." Above this poem there is an inscription reading "hito go? hito" (person御？person)】

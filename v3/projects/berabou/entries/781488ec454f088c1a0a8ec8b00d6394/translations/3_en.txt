【Integrated version】
It was a peaceful spring night when various monsters gathered. Counting them, there was no mikoshi-nyudo (palanquin demon), nor any one-eyed demon. There were those famous in kusazoshi known to children and old women alike: first, the cut stump of a great tree, thick roots, dorayaki, sweet potatoes, sea bream miso soup, four dishes, a bowl of red rice for appearance, mountain jar-crow, kitchen knife's small blade with swallowing mark, long-tailed bird of Narazu forest, "did you see heaven," and the flying tea kettle. Each offered New Year's congratulations and tilted their sake cups with toso wine, herring roe, candied sardines, and pickled burdock root with vinegar.

【Kitchen knife's small blade's speech】
Both of us are quick-witted, but this stinking kusazoshi of many years - there's nothing as auspicious to drink

【Flying tea kettle's speech】
The small blade's speech is always amusing, and indeed, our belly button boils tea

【Main text continues】
The cut stump of a great tree spoke of the evil intentions he had conceived to his subordinate monsters

The flying tea kettle responds

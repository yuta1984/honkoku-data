Ashinoya Seiemon lost his strength when his son Seitaro took a thousand ryo and ran away from home, disappearing without a trace. Having no other suitable heir, he adopted his clerk Daiji as his son, transferred his fortune of one million ryo to him, and then Seiemon passed away.

Now, Seitaro has designated the day he left home as the death anniversary, and today he is holding a fiftieth memorial service, inviting the family temple priest and performing an elaborate memorial ceremony.

[Daiji's dialogue]
I inherited this house because today's Buddha (the deceased Seiemon) is no longer with us. Even if I perform thousands upon thousands of memorial services, it would not be enough. Today's Buddha was the same age as I am.

[Serving woman's dialogue]
Please have some more of the hot soup.

[Temple priest's dialogue]
I have heard that fine cuisine is served at centennial memorial services. I too would like to live long enough to enjoy such cooking as a treat on such occasions. What thoughtful consideration and what elaborate cuisine this is.

Seitaro tried to settle down in Edo, but having grown up in restrictive circumstances, he found Edo to be a very uncomfortable place and traveled around the five home provinces, Shikoku, Chugoku, and Saigoku regions. When he returned to Edo at age forty after twenty years away, it was amusing that he was amazed for the first time by Japan's greatest freedom.

In the past four or five years, he has spent enormous amounts of money on his regular companions in the four districts of Yoshiwara, Shinagawa, Fukagawa, and Shinjuku. All those called geisha, regardless of gender, sit in the lowest position saying "Gold, gold, master, there's no one else!"

[Seitaro's dialogue]
"I'm already tired of buying prostitutes. I intend to ransom famous courtesans from pleasure quarters in all directions and give up buying prostitutes for the time being."

[Servant's dialogue]
"It would be good to discuss the ransom arrangements soon."

The one ransomed from Yoshiwara was Oyoshi, from Shinagawa was Oshina, from Yotsuya was Oshin, and from Fukagawa was Onaka. With four mistresses, his visits to the pleasure quarters became less frequent.

Recently he has begun composing haikai poetry, taking characters from "Ashino-ya Seitaro" to create the pen name "Assei," and has become absorbed in haikai. His character of participating in everything without exception - ten-thousand verse competitions, booklet publications, New Year celebrations, memorial services, etc. - remained unchanged.

[Seitaro's dialogue]
"Kyo... the reputation is somewhat sweet verse. Is the play on 'human ten-thousand' good?"

[Haikai master's dialogue]
"Everything is good, it's excellently done."

Long, long ago - so it may be a lie for all we know - in the vicinity of Asakusa Kaya-cho, there lived a man called Ashino-ya Seizaemon, known as "Hyakuman-ryo Fugen" (Silent Million Ryo), a tremendously cunning wealthy man. His household rules were naturally strict, with not a trace of luxury, and his son Seitaro was also raised by his stern father and lived in constraint. Because of this, he could not meet with the world's sophisticates (playboys) and spent his days until age twenty-one constantly pondering his circumstances.

The clerk Daiji was the same age as Seitaro and had been clever by nature since childhood. He was extremely close to Seitaro, and they would always share their troubles with each other.

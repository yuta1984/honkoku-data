Unaware that such circumstances had developed, Seita-ro came to visit after fifty years, only to find that Daiji, who had been a clerk, had become the head clerk and was now settling a debt of one million ryo. Seita-ro's fifty years of indulgence were exposed in this single day, and he truly broke out in a sweat all over his body.

[Daiji's dialogue]
The debt of one million ryo that I hold is precisely that of Seita-ro-dono. I don't begrudge it in the least, but the young master's misconduct toward the head of the house is truly pitiful. Come now, I shall hand over the keys to the storehouse, so please do with them as you wish.

[Head clerk's dialogue]  
What an outrageous thing! This is truly beyond belief. To think he fulfilled the role of head clerk with completely false credentials!

[Daiji's retainer's dialogue]
Indeed, it would be impossible to gather one million ryo in cash. Let us use the various town properties and divide them up gradually.

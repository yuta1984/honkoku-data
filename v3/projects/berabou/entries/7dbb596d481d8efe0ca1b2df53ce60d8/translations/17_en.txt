Seita-ro brings an account book detailing how he spent money over fifty years, stamped with Seita-ro's seal, and demands "Give me one million ryo."

[Daiji's dialogue]
Well now, that Seita-ro left this house fifty years ago. The fiftieth anniversary memorial service was completed yesterday.

What a big liar! Show proof that Seita-ro spent that money!

[Seita-ro's retainer's dialogue]
Well now, Seita-ro-sama's seal is the proof. According to the account book, the total amount spent comes to one million ryo, two bu, six monme, and seven fun. We'll forgive the two bu and some change. Please hand over the one million ryo.

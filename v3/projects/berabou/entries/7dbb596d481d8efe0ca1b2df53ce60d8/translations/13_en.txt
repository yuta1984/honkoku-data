Assei watched Keiko perform Dōjōji and thought, "Since I am fifty years old, I am much older than Keiko. There's no reason I couldn't do something of that level." From then on, he took up amateur kyōgen. He built a proper stage at his lower residence and frequently held kabuki performances for his enjoyment.

Besides the flowers,
　　Only pine trees grow dark in the evening
　　　Perhaps the temple bell rings

When Assei approached sixty, he realized that amateur kyōgen was rather foolish, so he took up ranbu (Noh dance). He built another stage and frequently performed Noh. Again spending lavishly, he completed the formal training and acquired a complete set of Noh costumes, becoming much more refined in his knowledge.

At the point where Seitaro performs the Noh play "Kantan," Rosei awakens from his dream.

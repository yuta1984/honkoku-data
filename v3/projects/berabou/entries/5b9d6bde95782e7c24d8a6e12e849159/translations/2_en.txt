"The Contest of Monsters at the Hour of the Ox" [Raccoon Dog Priest's Subscription List・Abbreviated Origin of the Shape-shifting Jizō] [Illustrated half-paper format, complete in one volume]
This book bases its plot on monster tales, follows the narrative style of puppet theater, and is primarily intended for entertainment. It is a rare book that will immediately cause readers to burst into laughter and spit out their food. Moreover, illustrations are added throughout, and everything is written in hiragana, making it very easy for children and women to read.

When the horse of intention gallops through the streets of the six dusts, it cannot be stopped by a groom's strength; when the monkey of the mind leaps among the branches of the five desires, it is beyond a monkey trainer's control. The human heart that wanders lost through myriad circumstances cannot easily find the right path even when asking at the checkpoint ahead. Therefore, the Buddha wrote various kyōgen plays and performed the quick costume changes of Kannon Bodhisattva to benefit all sentient beings widely. Thus, this booklet, compiled as material for such purposes, may also serve as an aid to encourage good and punish evil.

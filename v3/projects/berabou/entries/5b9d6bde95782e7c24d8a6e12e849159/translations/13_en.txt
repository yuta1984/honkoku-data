"No one knows a child better than the parent"—
as his son's way of handling letters
accumulated over time, the father's
patience finally snapped.
He strips Daijirō completely naked
and drives him out
wearing only a woven hat.

"Daijirō, who had always been
harsh in dealing with people
and willful and selfish,
today,
even in front of
the servants,
his shoulders
shrink,
his nose
is crushed, and he slinks
away dejectedly."

"Don't go!
Taking shameful words,
pursuing,
quickly
get out
and disappear,
you fool!"

"The master's
face, rolled up
for throwing,
looks like
a discarded
tengu
mask."

"Atago's barrier is
Kanjin-chō;
if made into a hawk,
it becomes
exile,
the end."

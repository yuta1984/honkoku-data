Daijirō now awakens to his situation and regrets his actions, but it is too late. He finds the world tasteless and decides to abandon it, leaving behind a farewell letter and heading out to drown himself in the Asakusa River. However, since no one knows where he has gone, even though they are moved to search, his parents and mother-in-law lose their way on the path of familial love as they set out; his wife and children lose their way on the path of longing; money lenders and tea house bill collectors lose their way on the path of greed; dissolute men lose their way regarding obligations; monks lose their way regarding religious law; courtesans lose their way in carnal desire; and samurai lose their way in arrogant hearts. All together, they follow his traces, searching and searching, wandering aimlessly on the path of delusion.

【Daijirō】
〽Emperor Jinmu rides upon an island shaped like Akitsushima (Dragonfly Island), but I am on a path shaped like the character for "delusion."

【Mother】
〽Where could he be and what is he doing? I hope he hasn't been bewitched by foxes.

【Son, being led by his mother's hand】
〽Mother, I'm tired.

【Bill Collector】
〽I will collect what is owed. I have no use for goods, but why did I come here?

【Courtesan】
〽Excuse me, customer, this is a strange path, isn't it?

〽Is that Musashino over there?
〽It looks like the path to Akiba-san - how troublesome.

Though visits to the pleasure quarters
require money as is customary,
Daijirō's obsession
with courtesans led him to mortgage
even his corner mansion
to others, and he was
given the cold shoulder
by the money changer's
master, while his aunt's
silk merchant shop
became too high a threshold for him.
Being pressed from all sides,
he crawled to
a moneylender named
Riheē of Kōzukiya
near Kashimoto-chō
to come begging
for money.

To the moneylender's
eyes, Daijirō's
face appeared like
Jizō Bodhisattva,
so he immediately
agreed and felt inclined
to lend him money—
how strange and wondrous,
a living Jizō!

【Moneylender Riheē】
♪Though you gamble
every day,
like piling stones
into a tower,
you can repay
without
hardship.

♪That person's face
I've certainly
seen at the
gambling den.

【Daijirō】
My family situation is
quite secure,
but if you wish,
I can put up as collateral
the mansion at
Rokudō crossroads
in [Aoyama].

Even for a short trip to
a nearby island,
he would use
palanquins
and
sedan chairs,
hire
formal dress (kamishimo),
and bring along
two or three
attendants,
spending money
like water from a bow,
but now as a disowned son
with no place to belong,
he seeks out his wet nurse's
home village, traveling alone
dejectedly—the saying that "travel
is melancholy and painful"
now resonates deeply
with his own situation.

"Today at least, my face
has no various
bad reputation,
and only in this regard
can I feel at ease."

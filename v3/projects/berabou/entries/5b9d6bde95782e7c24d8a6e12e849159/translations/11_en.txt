Among the four hundred and four illnesses,
nothing is more painful than poverty.
Among the one hundred thirty-six hells,
nothing is more terrifying than debt
collection.
As the year draws to a close
and our remaining funds
dwindle,
debt collectors
like demons
with their claws extended
press for payment
of various debts.
Their faces are so frightening
that to the debt collectors' eyes
we appear like pictures.

"Now, now, don't kindle
such fury—
please be calm."

"The debt of ten ryō
has become nine ryō in principal
with one ryō in interest
consumed."

"I've certainly intended
to pay until now,
but whatever we say,
it's like opposing wheels.
Very well then,
today I shall pay
down to the very last
rin without remainder.
Now, now,
be calm."

"If today's payment
is not forthcoming, we shall
go to the magistrate's office
and make our petition."

"Father, even my role
as a beauty has
become thoroughly degraded."

"Though it's not
unlimited money,
my debt
amounts to about
three hundred ryō."

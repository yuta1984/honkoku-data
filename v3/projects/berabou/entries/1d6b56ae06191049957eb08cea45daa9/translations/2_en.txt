Preface

Bakamura (Fool Village) is perhaps a descendant of the ninth generation of Takamura (Ono no Takamura). I am one who does not drink well from tenmoku tea bowls, whether they contain tea or cold rice, and I push aside even the great connoisseurs of the pleasure quarters, being an arrogant, glittering narcissist. Therefore, people all laugh at me as "that conceited Bakamura." Though my station is that of a townsman (merchant), I frequently travel to Edo, where I formed a bond with Ono no Komachi, and thus gave birth to Koikawa Harumachi. When Harumachi became a townsman, his father Bakamura devised wasteful characters and gave them to him, saying: "Scatter these on the cherry trees for the early spring, and display your pride to the town" (possibly a play on Komachi?).

Therefore, I paint and spread these foolish works to the world.

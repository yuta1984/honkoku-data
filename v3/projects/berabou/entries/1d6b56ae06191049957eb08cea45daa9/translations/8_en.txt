《Title: Parody, Old, Fixed Pattern, Morning After》
Being separated is parody, being rejected is turning one's back. Sideways is fixed pattern, sending off is morning after.

【Courtesan seeing off a man】
It's still early
yet
Well then
you'll come
on the third day

【Man being seen off】
Regarding that matter
this time
I must return
early this morning

【Male servant's lines】
That child
moon viewing perhaps?
it's fallen
please hand it
　over

【Courtesan attending to a drinking man in the parlor】
I don't like it
how foolish

【Man drinking in the parlor】
Fine
　even if I'm
　rejected
　here
In the second district
I'll
　be popular
　this time
　　　I'll
　　throw a tea bowl
　　　at them

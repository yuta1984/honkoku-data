The scandalous reputation, 
even if it were a false
love suicide,
would be quite
troublesome if it became
a terrible inconvenience.
After successfully carrying out this scheme,
they would let her be with the man she loves, so
with lines like what Yuranousuke would say,
they finally convinced her. For this autumn play,
Enjiro promised to provide the capital without interest,
so they asked the theater manager and ordered Sakurada
to write this story as a joruri puppet play.
The leading actor would be Monnosuke with
an old man role performing on stage - it would be a flashy
and boisterous theatrical performance. Naturally, to simply
pay for her freedom would not befit a romantic hero, so
in the manner of
elopement,
they break
the lattice window

set up
a ladder
and "redeem" her
from the
second floor.
Privately,
however you
managed to
redeem this
courtesan,
you may do
as you
please with her,
but the repair
costs for the lattice
will be two hundred ryo,
which we'll discount
for you - thus they expressed their goodwill.

【Spectator's dialogue】
I've heard of "eye medicine from the second floor"
but this is the first time
I've seen a redemption
like this!

【Brothel staff's dialogue】
How dangerous!
Please be
quiet and
make your
escape

Dear courtesan,
farewell,
have a good
elopement

The young men were
instructed to spread the word
everywhere that
their master had
embezzled money
and fled.

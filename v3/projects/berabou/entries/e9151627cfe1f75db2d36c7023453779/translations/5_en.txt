Contrary to his expectation that this rumor would surely spread throughout society, even his neighbors didn't know about it, so feeling deflated, he hired broadsheet sellers (yomiuri), had this story printed in a handbill, paying one ryō per person, and had them sell it throughout Edo.

【Broadsheet seller's pitch】
Big news! Big news! A beautiful geisha has fallen in love with Enjirō, the handsome son of a kimono merchant, and they've eloped together! What a scandal! Full details don't cost much for the printing - practically free!

【A woman from a window along the street】
What nonsense! It's all made up. Even reading it for free would be troublesome.

Every time Enjirō sneezed, he thought people must be gossiping about him, but since not even people in his own neighborhood knew about it, he decided to start frequenting courtesans to build up a reputation for himself. He came to the Matsuya in Naka-no-chō pleasure quarter, accompanied by a dissolute retainer named Kitarikino-suke and others, showing off extravagantly.

Courtesan: "I sent someone to inquire about Segawa-san and Utahime-san's houses, but since I saw this gentleman at Komatsuya earlier, Utahime-san must surely be indisposed."

"I hear you're performing at the Kōraiya theater in Kobiki-chō, or perhaps as Bokuga-san (pen name of Ōgiya Uemon)."

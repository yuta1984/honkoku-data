Enjirō decided on a courtesan named "Ukina" (Floating Reputation) at the pleasure quarter called Ukinaya, intending to make every single person fall for him. He put on great airs, fussing only with the decorative collar of his undergarment, acting pretentious, but thinking that being a playboy is truly an exhausting affair.

【Courtesan's dialogue】
Oh, that's quite nice, how refined you are!

【Men's dialogue】
It's not like Daikokuya's master, but it's all just a game of sugoroku with the courtesans.

Say, courtesan, people say you're quite a skillful woman in the world.

【Main text continues】
Enjirō thought that even if he frequented courtesans, there would be no satisfaction if no one was at home to be jealous when he returned. So he asked a go-between to find him a woman, specifying that as long as she was good at being jealous, he didn't care about her looks. He kept a woman close to forty as his mistress for a substantial sum of two hundred ryō.

【Men's dialogue】
Wasn't that the hell where we won at nakasute last spring?

Places called "piss crews" and such - no thank you!

【The mistress acquired for two hundred ryō】
Since you've taken me as your kept woman, you probably won't pay much attention to me when you're out buying courtesans or having affairs, so let me show you a bit more of my jealousy.

Enjirō recalls the cherry blossoms at home, and like the wild cherry blossoms that clung to him on his return journey, with sleeves like budding nodes beginning to bloom, he is dragged away by the kamuro (child attendants) like pulling weeds, his hair pulled from behind. With his heart strengthened, he cuts it saying "finally," and envies other customers who get caught up in such situations. For no particular reason, he requests the shinzō (apprentice courtesans) and kamuro to escort him to the Great Gate, and though he gets caught, with the promise that even if his status is torn, it will be fine, he is dragged away.

【Enjirō's dialogue】
"Hey, let me go! Being dragged around like this is embarrassing. This is the first time in my life I've experienced jealousy - it's an indescribable feeling."

【The shinzō and kamuro】
The shinzō and kamuro drag him along, chattering uselessly, with the promise of receiving dolls.

【Main text】
When Enjirō returns home after five or six days, his mistress, who had been waiting for him, thinking this is the perfect time for revenge, unleashes all the resentment she had been plotting.

"Really, why are men such strong-willed creatures? If you hate being so beloved, then you shouldn't have been born such a handsome man! And those courtesans too - taking away someone else's precious man! And you too - acting like it's good to lose interest and realizing such things!"

【Mistress's dialogue】
"After this, it's all about wearing Hachijō silk and island crepe!"

【Enjirō's dialogue】
"If you get a little more jealous, I'll buy you that Hachijō silk and island crepe you wanted."

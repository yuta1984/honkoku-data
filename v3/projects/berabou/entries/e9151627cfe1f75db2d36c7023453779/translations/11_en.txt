Seven or eight geishas from Yagenbori were hired by Enjiro to make barefoot pilgrimages to Kannon at Asakusa, hoping his disinheritance would be forgiven. Indeed, those who make barefoot pilgrimages are generally frivolous people.

【Geisha's dialogue】
"Let's beat ourselves halfheartedly and finish this quickly."

"About ten pilgrimages should be enough."

Enjiro received the disinheritance he desired, but since his mother sends makeup money whenever needed, he lacks nothing. However, wanting to try some frivolous trade, he thought that the business for a dandy would be selling paper, so even before summer came, he set out as a paper seller. After walking all day, he developed large blisters on his feet and was thoroughly fed up with it. At this time, he gained quite a reputation as a great eccentric.

"Oh my," says someone with a face like a Toba-e caricature as they pass by. Everyone comes, and they're all tall. When walking outside, one gets sunburned, so they apologize. What a troublesome thing.

Even the dandies going on about being in love and such are bothersome.

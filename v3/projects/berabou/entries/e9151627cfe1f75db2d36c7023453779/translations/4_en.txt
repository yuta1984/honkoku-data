The household maids also peek and whisper, "Our young master has fallen for someone - is she from the Senke school, the Koryū school, or the Enshū school? We don't know, but what an unexpected tea master!"

"♪Starting from nothing, having no one to rely upon in those days, I became someone's wife and grew accustomed to living in this new district, making people's hearts unfaithful" - this is in the style of a shirayōshi dancer. I am from the physician's house in Kayaba-chō, and I fell in love with your Enjirō at first sight from behind the planted trees. If I cannot become his wife, I would rather stop eating and die. If you say that's impossible too, I am prepared to die." She delivers such lines exactly as ordered.

"Well, who knows what kind of troubles a ladies' man faces! I'll give you another ten ryō, so please speak a bit louder so the neighbors can hear."

Enjirō's father, Yazaemon, unaware that this was arranged, felt sorry for her and gave her various advice before sending her away.

Here lived the only son of a merchant family called a millionaire, named Enjirō. He was around nineteen or twenty years old. While it's said that the disease of poverty doesn't affect the whole country and is among the lighter ailments, he was naturally inclined toward romantic pursuits and affairs. Reading the libretti of Shinuchi-bushi ballads, he envied the lives of characters like Tamakiya Itahachi and Ukiyo Inosuke, and had the foolish notion that "if I could have such romantic adventures and gain a reputation for affairs as a lifetime memory, I would eventually be willing to throw away my life." With this mindset, he came up with a life-or-death plan.

[Dialogue]
"If I could live such a life, how exciting it would be! What good fortune to be born under such favorable stars!"

Enjirō first thought that tattoos were the beginning of romantic affairs, so he got twenty or thirty random tattoos from both arms down to between his fingers. Enduring the pain, he rejoiced, saying "This is what makes a man!"

【Enjirō's dialogue】
"Becoming a ladies' man is quite a painful ordeal!"

【Tattoo artist's dialogue】
"The scattered ones in the middle mustn't be left incomplete, so let's apply more burns later."

Enjirō enviously thought it was romantic when beautiful daughters would take refuge in physicians' homes. He hired a local geisha named O-En, a dancer, for fifty ryō, intending to have her stage such a refuge scene, and came to ask his bad friend An for help.

【Geisha's dialogue】
"Not only will I take refuge, but I understand the vengeful intent as well."

【Bad friend An's dialogue】
"This is our lifeline - in any case, I'll take care of it for you. It's a bit of a path to success."

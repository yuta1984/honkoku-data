Manman got off at the designated place
and walked along talking about Edo stories.
From behind,
the previous palanquin bearers
came chasing after him
carrying the money
that had fallen
in the palanquin,
and since they
unreasonably
caught up with him,
though he made
various
excuses,
they wouldn't listen,
and it eventually
became a fight.

"These are
thin
fellows who
make accusations
against people
about things
they don't
even know"

"If you say
you don't want it,
then throw it
at those guys
and go home"

"Do you think
that if you tell
the honest truth,
people will
be frightened?
How outrageous!"

[From here, the middle volume]
This year
the world is
also peaceful,
so thinking
to buy and store
plenty of
rice,
watch for
the decline,
and sell it off
without loss,
he instructed
his agents
to buy and store
rice from
various provinces.

"At that
market price,
Mino and
Owari would be
about two or three shō
per unit.
Work hard and
buy it at a high price"

"We bought and stored
Hitachi and
Iwaki rice
mixed with water
at five shō
per ryō"

"With this, the treasury
will also be able
to accumulate
a little.
How joyful, how joyful!"

Hearing that
gambling
leaves one
unable to
maintain oneself,
thinking "This is
profitable,"
he gathered
many
underlings
for gambling,
taking the house cut
by raising
four-eights
to about seven,
collecting
the house fees.
However,
due to karma,
the bets
became
one-sided,

and when someone
cried "Open the eyes!
Open the eyes!"
he drew heavily
on the house
and profited
more than
expected.

[Maid]
"Master,
how is it?
Does it look good?
If so,
then again
the hand-cutting
tickets will be
poor, won't they?"

[Manman-sensei]
"Call it
a little strategy—
make someone
put out
their hand.
How unperceptive!"

[Gambler]
"Big Kai
and the brush-cut—
that's
six.
All right?"

In this gambling,
if you bet
from one
to six,
there's no
loss,
but everyone
dislikes
that kind
of betting.

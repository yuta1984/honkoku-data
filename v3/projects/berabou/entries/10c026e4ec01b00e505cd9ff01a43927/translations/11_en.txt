Around this time, heavy rains continued to fall, and as the rivers swelled, while staying at an inn for a while, news arrived that the rice he had stockpiled during this heavy rain had suddenly risen in price, bringing him profit.

"This is yet another outrageous thing! If he could see the prices rising, he should have held off from selling, but instead he's blocking me again."

"That's quite reasonable, but we've been troubled and plagued by money from long ago, so there's nothing to be done about it. It's gold coins after all - what a troublesome thing," can be heard.

"After all, with just one attempt, one's fortune won't turn around," so he devised a plan to have the pine trees of Miho no Matsubara dug up. With the transportation costs to Edo and all these expenses, surely his money would finally run out, so he first gathered many contractors and had them submit bids.

"We'll award it to whoever bids highest."

"With full obligation and duty, spare nothing, bid a large amount!"

"Since this is a bidding process, we've calculated it to make a considerable profit."

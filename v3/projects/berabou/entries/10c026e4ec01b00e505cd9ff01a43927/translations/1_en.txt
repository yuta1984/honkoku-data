【Handwritten in ink】Tenmei 《strikethrough: 5｜7》 year printed edition

Preface

The proverb says "There is illness in poverty, illness in wealth, money is the enemy," but
even so, thinking "just three hundred ryō, how fortunate this is!" and
being impressed and overly greedy, when you calculate it,
it's all shortfalls. At that point, it's "entering me, me entering" - whether I
break apart, or me being me, which way should one lean? Somehow
like the reeds of Naniwa, swift to earn, the poor person who catches up
- to teach them about sufficiency, this small kusazōshi book
by my friend Torai Sanwa speaks of the unchanging spring's wild outpourings
merely weaving patterns with his words.

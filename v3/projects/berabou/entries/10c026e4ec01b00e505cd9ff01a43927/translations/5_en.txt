The initial meeting's
entry fee,
secret arrangements,
the third meeting's
pillow talk,
Kannon's
offerings, hundreds of
seasonal festivals,
iris flowers,
fortune's
tree
lanterns,
twice monthly
shaving, while
speaking of such things,
"This should be
quite
exhausting," he thought,
but unexpectedly
beyond the
ordinary,
he spent
large sums.
"Should I continue
knowing this?"
From his private funds
he brought out
the scattered money,
collected it,
grumbling
"It's nothing,"
and returned it all.

[Brothel staff persuading Manman]
"Well, honored guest,

"Well, you connoisseur

"What now, well
fine, go home
from this place, all the way
right?"

"Well, shall we let him go? Right?"

"Well
fine, go home
heh heh heh heh heh
heh heh heh"

[Master Manman insists he'll leave but won't take the money]
"Just as
you say,
I too, well that
well
all along
therefore
I'll go home,
I'll go home, but
the money
is too much"

[Brothel staff explaining that the accounting office is demanding he take it]
"We would
like to
receive it,
but even
receiving
this much
the accounting office
is being
troublesome
about it"

At the brothel's
end of day,
completely
blocked in,
unable to wait
for dawn
to break,
when returning,
getting into
a palanquin
on the way,
it appeared
that the previous
passenger had
forgotten and
dropped
some four or five hundred ryō
in a purse,
but thinking
"If I speak carelessly
about this,
I might also
get tied up in trouble,"
he pretended
not to know.

"Even so,
when you get on
at the slope,
it's as you please,"
he decided.

[Palanquin bearers]
"We take payment
by distance,
so if we
receive it that way,
our reputation
would be bad.
It's out of
daily compassion,
so at the seven o'clock slope,
please forgive us"

[Master Manman]
"Whatever you say,
if I don't know it,
it won't do"

[Palanquin bearers]
"Please don't
become
violent"

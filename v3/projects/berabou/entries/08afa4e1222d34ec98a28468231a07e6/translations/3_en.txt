The 60th Human Emperor, Emperor Daigo, was indeed a sovereign of remarkable virtue. At the age of thirteen, he inherited the throne of ten virtues, and with Right Minister Sugawara no Michizane serving as his mentor, he governed all state affairs and bestowed benevolence upon the people. As a result, the realm became increasingly peaceful, and even foreign countries were swayed by his virtue—there was not a single plant or tree that did not bend to it. The Engi era of sage rule refers precisely to this emperor, and it is only natural to speak of him in such terms.

[Dialogue of the kamuro (young attendants)]
Tonight's night duty is long. We'll assign a man to the Jōneisho. He might get in the way.

[Dialogue of Sugawara no Michizane]
To govern the people with sincerity is somewhat more difficult than stroking one's beard with one's hand.

[Dialogue of the women]
The plum blossom can be compared to a warrior who shows his colors, and can also be called an elegant scholar. Since it's a flower that combines literary and martial arts, Sugawara no Michizane, who favors it, is also a person who excels in both literary and martial arts.

[Dialogue of Emperor Daigo]
For all matters great and small, is it best to entrust the governance of the realm to you?

In homes there are no mice, and in the country there are no thieves - not even enough to use as medicine - all is well-ordered. In such auspicious times, there is no need to hold back. Even if someone is deemed unnecessary, when one person says they will break down a door, everyone agrees, saying "This is absolutely right!"

We young men break down doors, and truly this is a time without reproach - this is what should be called such an era.

[Onlooker's dialogue]
Let us break down the door properly!

[Onlooker's dialogue]
Since the world continues with abundant harvests, there are no hardships in daily life. Times are prosperous!

[Onlooker's dialogue]
That young man's vigor is tremendous strength!

[Onlooker's dialogue]
He works like a tengu!

[Young men breaking down the door]
Come on, don't worry about it - smash the door down!

[Female householder's dialogue]
What a grateful world this is!

With a woman's skill, the door cannot possibly be broken down.

Theater performances featuring love suicides or domestic dramas are no longer popular. The play written by Sakurada Jisuke this time is said to be definitely in the contemporary style.

At this place:

First act, fourth scene
Set in the mansion of the Li clan, the curtain opens with "Hachiitsu" music. With the drop curtain, Nakazō and Kōshirō, both called imperial messengers, both playing the role of Confucius, enter from both flower paths to the main stage. The two engage in Confucian scholarly debates and arguments. At the trigger of their dispute saying "You are an official," three phoenixes descend from above, which Kōshirō finds suspicious.

[Kōshirō's dialogue]
Ah, this is strange indeed!

[Main text continues]
Revealing that Nakazō is actually Yanghu, he counters the argument with bamboo hidden in the wall. After a brief combat and sword fight, he throws his opponent, and it's a play where everyone from those who witnessed Shaozhengmao's beheading to the common people are struck down, dressed in formal attire.

[Dialogue]
Eating three portions of coarse rice out of a hundred, drinking four-mon worth of water per day, enduring hunger by distracting oneself, one person suffers, and meanwhile there's commotion like a crowd, the movement is light!

[Handwritten in ink] Kansei 1, Year of the Rooster

Preface
Indeed, to speak of the divine virtue of Tenman Daijizaiten is quite an overwhelming task, but I record the meritorious achievements of this country that is governed in great peace without closing its barriers, making it into a fifteen-volume booklet like those of Baekje and China, only to celebrate the jewel-like spring.

　Volume One: The waves and winds of Sueshirakawa
　　　　　　　　are also calmed and swayed by the abundant harvest of the people

　Volume Two: The great peace under heaven
　　　　　　　　and the twin paths of literary and martial arts practiced together

　Volume Three: The blessed era with shaven foreheads
　　　　　　　　　the admirable customs of Japan

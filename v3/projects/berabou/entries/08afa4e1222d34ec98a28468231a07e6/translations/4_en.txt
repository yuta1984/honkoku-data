During the emperor's prosperous reign, gold and silver rained down continuously for three days and three nights from distant mountains of Mutsu Province—not to mention other places—and from gold mines in Sado and other remote provinces throughout the land. The common people's joy was beyond measure.

[Dialogue of people gathering gold falling from the sky]
To think that gold is falling—gold that has been separated from sand and ash, even bearing the official mint marks! What a wonder!

When prosperous, it shines brightly; when declining, it grows cloudy. Gold falls from Sado's gold mines.

Gold is falling steadily like rain!

The downpour has become a bit more intense.

We must work diligently to gather it up.

【Main text】
Lord Daikoku returned home unsuccessful from Hotei's place, and when he opened the mouth of the bag that had been returned from Hotei to examine it, Bishamonten appeared from within, causing him to lose face once again.

【Bishamonten's dialogue】
Yesterday you said you didn't have even one bundle, but what is this? Do you look down on me as someone with bad character who borrows money but doesn't return it? Well, this is quick - should I say "thank you" or should I say "I'm grateful"?

【Daikokuten's dialogue】
No, well, that matter is nothing much, it's just something, and I could prepare another box for your use as well.

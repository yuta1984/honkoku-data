There is a limit to what is called dawn. Here lies
the glory of the famous pleasure quarters.
Flowers do not tell the cherry blossoms of spring's
length, do not tell the cuckoo of light
clothing, do not tell the autumn wind of
evening's loneliness,
and even on snowy days do not know
the cold. Such limitless plea-
sure is true glory.

The flowers would say: Recently,
a wealthy patron came and playfully
requested to see
sumo wrestling among the courtesans of this quarter.
One called Risyaku received this request, and likened the four
seasons' flowers to the forms of famous courtesans,
determining spring and summer as East
and setting autumn and winter as West,
already beginning the sumo match.

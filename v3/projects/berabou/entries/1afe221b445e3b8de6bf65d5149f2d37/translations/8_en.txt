【From here, the second volume】

Though not truly skilled,
this person who
composes kyōka (comic poems)
is not really
a poet, but
borrowing the name
from mother,
making the composer
unknown,
saying it was created—
even one poem
catches the eye
on this path, so
later
reluctantly
even if composed,
it gets composed anyway

Still don't want to
show it to parents
Such aspects are harsh
Just like opening miso

Kagome: Cherry blossom root charcoal
Surround, surround, only the birds within the cage, this morning
In the spring dawn, cranes stretching their wings

Which
mountain
is higher?
This
mountain
is
higher,
Hiko

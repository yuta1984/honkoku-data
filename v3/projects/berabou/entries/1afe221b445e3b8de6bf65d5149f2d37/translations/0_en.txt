【This work is featured in episode 30 of "Berabo," and was produced by publisher Tsutaya Jūzaburō who collected money from kyōka poets. It operated on a system where people who wanted their poems published in the book would pay a fee. The artist Kitagawa Chiyojo is said to be a disciple of Utamaro, though there is a theory that this was actually an alternate name used by Utamaro himself】

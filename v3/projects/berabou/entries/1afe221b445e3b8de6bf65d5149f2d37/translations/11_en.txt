Rosei's dream is fifty years
Kinpira's dream is ten hair papers
Neither Hotei
Nor witty humor
But collected writings
Of child treasures
Fukudaikoku and Ebisu songs
Truly auspiciously scattered
On the cherry trees of Sanno shrine
Taking thirty-three thousand three hundred
Setting aside, adding two poems to thirty-three
Thirty-five thousand year-old monk's pine tea, this year too
In the spring of the Dragon year, writings from all directions gathered
From various places, the divine essence picked and written here
This is the saving of Heso-kuri Tenno's filial devotion
　　　　　　Hip hip hooray, Tenno's eldest son

　　New Year's Day　　Master of the Navel Hole (Heso-no-ana-nushi)
Returning again in this innocent way
　The name too is interesting, the first spring of youth

Son
Of Heso village
Resident Suwashi
ri's predecessor
Well, the master of the navel hole
Also has unreadable
Mad poetry, so with
Another's brush
Auspiciously
　I humbly submit

Disciple of Utamaro　Chiyojo's illustration

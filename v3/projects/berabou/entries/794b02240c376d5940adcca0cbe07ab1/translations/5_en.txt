Like light piercing through the holes in old shoji screens, would you not buy this jewel of the dragon king as an awakening from spring slumber? Though I am not a book seller, I am greatly obliged to you, writes Kisanji on the cover.

In the vicinity of Seta in Omi Province lived a man named Tawara Kyūzō, who possessed a miraculous jewel that his ancestor Hidesato had brought back from the Dragon Palace to their village through divine blessing. This jewel produced one hundred ryō of gold per day, and when invested in increments of twenty-five ryō, it would generate one ryō of interest each month, earning it the name "Prayer Jewel."

Here lived a mountain ascetic named Anchin from Shirakawa. He was presently a rare handsome man who made pilgrimages to Kumano every year. This year too, intending to worship at Kumano, he departed from Shirakawa and tonight stayed at the inn of Tawara Chōja (the wealthy Tawara). The wealthy man's daughter, Ohide, fell in love with Anchin at first sight and secretly came to Anchin's sleeping quarters late at night, where they pledged their love and spoke of their bond for two lifetimes.

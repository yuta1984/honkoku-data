Now the next
sacred treasure is among the five hundred
arhats, the Buddha called
"Ogoruba [Pride] the
Venerable One." This is precisely
the venerable one of "one mon,
three prostrations" carved from
the root and tip of a money tree
by the head clerk and assistants who lit fires
in the great finale
and performed religious austerities
for seven days without eating.

Those who worship
this Ogoruba
the Venerable One
once will escape from
the excess of vanity
and affected mannerisms, and be saved
to the Pure Land of earnestness—
such is his sacred
vow.

Among the other five hundred arhats,
there are many venerable ones
called "Drinking
Venerable One" and "Eating
Venerable One," whom
heavy drinkers and teetotalers alike
should have faith in.

Venerable One, cleaning
　　　〳〵
Without that
attitude,
one cannot maintain
a household—
this must be
what that means."

♪"If that letter is
seen by you, sir,
there's not even one kon left—
the cut end
of drawn cedar boards,
an inkstone lid
has come."

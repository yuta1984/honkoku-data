The statue of Kansen Myō-ō (Money-Viewing Wisdom King), the guardian deity of merchants.
"Kansen" is written with characters meaning "advancing toward money."
He holds an abacus as his prayer beads, and has six arms.
This represents the blessing that one person should be able to earn as much as three people.
By worshipping him, one receives help in subduing the demons of anger and debt.

♪"The venerable statue occasionally speaks:
'Today is a day when absolutely nothing
can be calculated or earned.'"

♪Singing only "Buying is venerable, the wife is precious,"
People tend to go out for overnight stays and buy beautiful courtesans—
this "buying is venerable." When one's heart is stolen by women,
one's work-Buddha becomes neglected.
When one treasures only one's wife and lives harmoniously together,
becoming wealthy and achieving Buddhahood is certain. For this reason,
we reverently declare:
"Buying is venerable, the wife
is precious."

The Courtesan
Saint's
Thousand-Sheet
Written Oath

The Courtesan
Saint is
a manifestation
of the Work
Tathāgata, who
writes such
false
oaths
and leaves them
in the final age
as a warning
to sentient beings.
Those who take
these oaths
as truth
will immediately
lose their Work Tathāgata.
If one treasures only
that woman and plots
internally,
one's fortune
will surely be lost—
such is his
sacred vow.

♪"If one follows
just this teaching well,
the sacred treasure will not
meet with eyes that say
'I'm starving,
starving.'"

Now, what we call the founding ancestor bodhisattva of our house
practiced difficult ascetic training throughout life,
performing emaciated austerities, not eating delicious
food, not wearing fine clothes, but with
single-minded devotion seeking to guide descendants forever
to the lotus
throne of
the highest grade
of the Pure Land,
thinking thus.
Like the
founding masters
of commerce,
through trading
in single coins and half-coins,
they established
a storehouse-built
edifice,
with many
patron-customers
called "regulars,"
daily magnificent
household
prosperity,
and profits in
gold and silver
falling
abundantly
like rain.

All of this
is due to
these ancestor
bodhisattvas'
divine protection.
Therefore,
the great ledger
and long
sales records
should be considered
the biographical
chronicles and
illustrated legends
of our ancestors'
founding
charitable works
and establishment.

The sacred image of the founding ancestor
bodhisattva and the amulet for business prosperity
are issued from here—
Famous paintings, a thousand,
manifesting in threes!

♪What is enshrined here is,
most graciously,
our house's founding
ancestor bodhisattva's
sacred
image.

Picture of the Mandala of Shamisen Strings with Three Central Buddha Figures and Courtesans' Thanksgiving Service
Those who believe in these three central Buddha figures will immediately
lose their thunder through credit sales, and their bodies will
become dust - fear and be cautious

This is the mandala from long ago when Princess Shinzo
became obsessed with the shamisen strings at the display house
on Mount Tori
These three central Buddha figures have twelve or thirteen
black hairs shining like those of servants with body combs
Among them are also supreme kings of courtesan honor
On the hanging scroll of the leisure horse, there is a poem saying:
♪What I thought yesterday would happen tomorrow
Today mostly changes - such is the way of the world
This is the work of Master Baitoku

The incense burner of moon rats and sun rats
This hanging scroll and incense burner represent half the human condition
Do not think there will be tomorrow - the passing of months and days
is faster than threading string through a ball -
this is a warning
♪Sekki Saburo the debt collector's bow
The arrowhead items of the broad rhyme dictionary
should be bought with cash
When official documents don't appear
and one borrows thoughtlessly and spends freely,
immediately Sekki Saburo's bow
will use its wide-ranging arrows
to pierce through
the debtor's chest
Do not be careless

This etiquette
one by one
strikes right at
our hearts

The temple treasures of Oyaji Sandōyoku Temple
Written by Tōdenshu's brush about the hell of usury:
The fixed form—merchants should
sell white goods cheaply and not
greedily pursue high profits,
otherwise they will not prosper in the end.
Conversely, those who have goods
sold to them become unknowing
Buddhas, but those who
sold at high prices
fall into the hell of usury and immediately
their business fails to prosper,
their fortune becomes a wheel of fire,
their household goods lacking for life.
In hell, the Great King Zenma (Money Demon)
reflects in an ice mirror
the high and low prices of white goods
and admonishes them.

After all, making
a leap to hell
　　　　　is bad
The steady path is good indeed
Hail to the wealthy

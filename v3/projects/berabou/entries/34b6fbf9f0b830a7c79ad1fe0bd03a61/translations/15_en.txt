Statue of Hidō Myō-ō (Flying Path Bright King) 《Marginal note: Supporting figures | Water-cooking companions | If so, companions》
This
Flying Path
Bright King
was created by
a man called
Mitao Shirōbee
When his descendants became lazy
and finally lost their livelihood
and folded up their household,
selling their pots, mortars, dishes,
and tea bowls,
this Flying Path Deity appears
with the sacred vow
to restore them through the flying path
The flames on his back
represent the parable
that fire falls
upon one's heart

This is what we call a parent's dying words -
a masterwork sword
more precious
than even the Gosan Amida Dharma Sword
Therefore, when one thoroughly
absorbs these dying words, nothing will go wrong.
Next is the head-helmet,
called kabuto.
If you tighten
the cords
of this head-helmet
kabuto
so that no one
can strike off
your helmet,
then nothing will go wrong -
such is the admonition
of the Thousand-Armed Bodhisattva
By this vow,
yes, it shall be
so
Ah, my mouth has become
dry

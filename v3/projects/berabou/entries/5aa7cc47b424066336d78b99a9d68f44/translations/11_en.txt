Postface

In the pleasure quarters there is a creature whose head is like a comic skit, whose tail is like a festival, whose limbs are like dancing, and whose voice resembles theater - what might this be?
This is indeed what is called "niwaka" (impromptu entertainment), and its themes differ day by day, night by night.
Yesterday's excitement changes as easily as the Asuka River, and taking this as a flower,
I have illustrated it completely without omission or oversight, titled it "Meigetsu Yojō" (Moonlight Lingering Emotions),
and plan to continue from the first volume through the second and third volumes and progressively with several more volumes
to provide for the perusal of pleasure-seeking visitors.

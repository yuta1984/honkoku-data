The disciples of Yoshitsune, as well as others learning swordsmanship, seeing the Kannon votive plaques, thought that swordsmanship required a teacher like Ushiwakamaru, who in his fervor performed the "thousand-man killing" at Gojo Bridge. They believed that one cannot become skilled without cutting down many people, but since killing people would make it difficult to escape official punishment, every evening they went out to Gojo Bridge, the willow riding grounds, crossroads, and small streets. On nights with good weather, wearing high geta and carrying fans with the rising sun, they practiced "thousand-man striking" on passersby with wooden swords or bamboo swords.

【Dialogue of the man striking someone's neck】
What! I am a disciple of Yoshitsune who has been granted permission to use the Tōta Hokutō Sanryaku!

【Dialogue of the person hitting buttocks】
Iya hentarako! (This is the 999th person - just one more and I can take my leave from the thousand-man striking!)

How slovenly! The darkness of striking buttocks is like the guys from Mikumano - the waterfall rapids echo on these buttocks.

Well now! Because this is bokutō (wooden sword), if this were a real sword both arms would have been cut off. With that affected manner of yours, your opponent surely feels no pain. Please strike with a calm heart.

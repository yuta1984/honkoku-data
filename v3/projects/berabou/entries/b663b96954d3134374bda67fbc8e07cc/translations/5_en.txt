Chinzei Hachiro Tametomo, whose powerful bow pierced through the chest plates of both Ito Goro and Ito Rokuro during the Hogen night battle, had a particularly distinctive teaching method. Since archery on the battlefield targets people, no one can remain perfectly still. Therefore, large targets or goose-feather arrows won't suffice. They summoned a person with a hole in their belly from some foreign illustrated book, dressed him in armor, suspended him, and had students shoot at him from above the armor as he moved about.

【Dialogue of the person shooting arrows】
Did it hit just right? Wasn't that the navel?
〽With arrows painful in the navel, body and soul grow weary, and "arrow" was written on this shop curtain【one line is hidden in the binding】

〽If it's archery like hitting the mark, well then that's the banner, but deep arrows are definitely excused, the bowels can't bear it, Lord Bowels, you ask unreasonable things

〽If the belly hurts, go to Yoshino, how about it, how about it?

Being suspended and made to move about is like difficult Nankin puppet manipulation, samba samba samba

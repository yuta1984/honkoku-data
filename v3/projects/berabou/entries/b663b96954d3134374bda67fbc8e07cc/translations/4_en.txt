Yoshitsune was ordered to provide instruction in swordsmanship, but since he learned his sword techniques from tengu in the valley of the Kurama Abbot, the sparring partner (uchitachi) should properly be a tengu. However, since a tengu cannot be summoned immediately, they put a tengu mask on the person playing the sparring partner, attached wings so he could fly, and had people with large fans blow air to lift him up so he could perform sword techniques while flying through the air. The attendants wear high geta clogs and hold a rising sun fan in one hand while sword fighting with the other.

【Dialogue of those fanning with uchiwa fans】
Yes, that's right.

There's no screen over there, so the wind doesn't carry well.
Come on, Sansuke, steady now, steady!

【Text continues】
Since Emperor Engi cast off his eight-tan robes on that cold night and dressed plainly, court nobles, palace courtiers, and all other people stopped wearing the fashionable long haori completely and began wearing brown cotton tubular-sleeved haori instead. Therefore, this became an example of the Engi and Kanryaku eras and proper attire that is cited even in later generations.

【Dialogue of the person fighting the tengu with a rising sun fan】
Yattou, ei!

【Dialogue of the person playing the tengu】
Tooth powder, hangontan [revival pills], if you need them, recently...
Yattou, ei!

The one who flew up complains bitterly - being a tengu is unbearable, unbearable!

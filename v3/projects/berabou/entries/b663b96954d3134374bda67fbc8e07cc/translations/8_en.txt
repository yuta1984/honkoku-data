By the will of His Lordship alone, proclaiming oneself the best in the realm at archery, horsemanship, and swordsmanship became extremely popular. Moreover, hearing the story of how Emperor Engi cast off his eight-jō eight-tan imperial robes on a cold night to become a monk, everyone began wearing monk's robes. From Kūkyō Tenjōnin in Chinese-colored cotton Bussaki reformed robes down to those in Chinese-colored Bussaki haori, each carrying bows, they eagerly shot and shattered helmet bowls at antique shops in the entertainment districts, helmet bowls at pottery shops - anything with "bowl" in its name, even roof tiles - trying to pierce them like votive plaques to Kannon.

【Dialogue of people who rushed into the pottery shop with bows】
What a racket this is! If you're going to complain about this and that, we'll shoot through the shop owner's head!

Since you won't show us the pottery, oh my, oh my!

【Dialogue of the pottery shop owner】
If my merchandise gets broken, how can I do business? I'm putting my hands together in prayer, so please have mercy on me!

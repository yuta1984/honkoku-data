Amano Jakuro thought to himself: "People nowadays, even though they struggle financially, still love elegant pastimes. I'll imitate the court nobles' amusements and have them pick small pines on New Year's first Day of the Rat, and make money from it. This year, the seven herbs day falls on the Day of the Rat, so I'll spread word of this throughout society beforehand."

He rented out Uneme-ga-hara field, planted many small pines and young herbs, and borrowed headwear, ceremonial costumes, court caps, hunting robes, and even twelve-layered court garments from Nakamuraya in Sakai-cho. He prepared everything on a grand scale, planning to rent them cheaply to people who wanted to enjoy the Day of the Rat festivities. However, since it was the day of the seven herbs, no one came to look, and even the occasional idle passerby who did come to see would never actually pick pines for amusement. Not a single person borrowed and wore the ceremonial costumes.

His grand enterprise for this first Day of the Rat of early spring completely failed, and everyone passed by making snide remarks and speaking ill of him as a slow-witted fool.

"How unusual! What kind of show is this?"

"What would you do with picked small pines? Even if you took them home and planted them, they'd be useless."

"I don't understand it at all."

"Come pick small pines! Come gather young herbs! Come and play!"

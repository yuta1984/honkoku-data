Intending to score a big hit with the kaomise (face-showing) performance, he became the financial backer and had a play written that none of the troupe agreed with. While he alone was pleased, the audience showed no interest whatsoever. Far from being a hit, it closed after about ten days, and from the fifteenth day they performed a different play, barely managing to save face.

♪All the actors say it's a play that doesn't touch the heart, with no audience - how very stirring!

♪Among the eastern barbarians, southern barbarians, northern barbarians, western barbarians - the four barbarians of the eight wastelands between heaven and earth - there will never be another such play. The playwright over there, learning gradually with such persistence, this year's call for inner teachings, from the upper regions a single voice of white benefit, the gold-waisted headpiece was naturally prepared beforehand. Not the forelock but the bear's charm having run out, this face-showing performance with its reputation of being too much chatter, even if it's a shaven monk's hanging, beheading, or triple ceremony - a scattering of everyone. If you entrust this tooth to the sayori fish in a circle, it becomes a bird - a strange way of connecting court nobles, humbly spoken from afar.

"Watching while lying down - what a pleasant thing! What an easy face-showing performance this is!"

"What terrible dialogue!"

"It's a play like a tea ceremony farce!"

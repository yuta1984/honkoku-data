Preface

The early, middle, and late volumes of works like Koikawa Harumachi's "Muda-ki," Kisanji's "Mitai-ki," and Bansho-tei's "Irai-ki" all share similar themes, merely attempting to gauge the spirit of future generations. Here, a man named Amano Jakuro, measuring the hearts of people in this current world, thought that old methods like moldy miso would not suffice. With fresh ideas like carp in Kamakura under a starry moonlit night, he considered morning and evening how to benefit people through the grand display of townspeople's leggings, without using yellow books. Like fires of Kyushu, unknown to matters of Mount Ashigara, he felt as though he had dropped precious savings into golden soil. He tells these foolish tales, like those of mountain birds, as three scrolls - the blue of a dog's spring, where cherry trees go mad in the snow.

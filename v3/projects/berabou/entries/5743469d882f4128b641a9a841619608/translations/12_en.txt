Since there would be people too busy to go out for chrysanthemum viewing, they devised the idea of "display chrysanthemums" to carry around. The prices were: two hundred mon for a brief viewing per tan of field, and for a half-day rental, three hundred hiki of gold per three tan of field. They went around announcing that this was excellent for entertaining guests.

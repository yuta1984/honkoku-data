Female geisha are nothing unusual, so they created "wakashu geisha" styled like local young men. They named it "nomeru" (to drink/fall) after the female geisha's tendency to "korobu" (fall/tumble), suggesting that romantic affairs might be possible - though one cannot really say such things openly. When they introduced this concept, how trendy it seemed!

♪Is it about sake?
　How grateful

♪"Nomeru" - 
　is it about sake?

Well, won't you have a drink with me?

♪Rather than drinking,
　shall we play komori (a game)?

When the eleventh month came, they distributed handbills. The gist was:
"Hair-binding ceremony, hakama-wearing ceremony, obi-untying ceremony, doctor's services - everything for celebratory occasions available for daily rental. For young masters, if you inform us of the family crest three days in advance, we can prepare it with Shohei-mon, silver Imon crests, etc. to meet your needs."
Such was the advertisement, with detailed pricing.

♪Even if you summon a palanquin-carriage,
　the trailing robes we provide
　are so fine
　that we serve
　most splendidly

♪It's better to
　borrow these new ones
　from the authorities
　and dress up
　even for celebrations

Mother, when is my hakama ceremony?

When February came, from around the 27th or 28th day through March and April, he devised hina doll displays. He began accepting orders for shelving of various sizes - one-ken shelves, nine-shaku shelves, two-ken shelves - whatever was desired. He assembled everything from large hina dolls to dogs, cats, dining sets, doll accessories, and even clay sake cups, along with artificial flowers, and set prices for them all.

He thought that places celebrating their first Doll Festival, being rather sparse in decorations, would eagerly rent his items. However, contrary to his expectations, people said these might be old used dolls and would bring bad luck. Unlike other cheap goods, not a single person rented from him, so this venture failed spectacularly and caused him great losses. To recover these losses, he once again devised another dubious scheme.

♪ "When that time passes, first we'll have a complete set, all properly arranged. That must be the 'mountain mark' set."

♪ "Even though I've prepared twenty different types and there are buyers for all of them, it would take about ten years to recover the initial investment. By then everything will have gotten old and deteriorated, so when you calculate it all, when will there ever be any profit?"

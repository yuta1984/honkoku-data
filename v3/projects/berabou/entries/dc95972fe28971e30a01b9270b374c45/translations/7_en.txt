"Please forget what I asked you." "Kamuro: I already told you so." 《This refers to arranging the bedroom differently than usual, because this is a shared parlor room, so silently》
《This consideration is so that words cannot be heard; tonight's client appears to be a big spender》"Client (young man): About eighteen years old, well-built with good looks, doesn't speak much, appears to be the son of a good family by his appearance, has one companion with him. After the bedroom is arranged, lying on five futon with his obi still removed, writing something in the hand-warmer with the tip of fire tongs" "Courtesan: 《Coming in and sitting bashfully toward the dark side》 Won't you remove your upper garment?" "Young man: Yes 《saying only this and removing it》"
"Courtesan: 《Folding it and placing it on the alcove》 You seem even more tense." "Young man: Why?" "Courtesan: Because you remain silent." "Young man: I don't know what to say." "Courtesan: You're lying. You are indeed quite experienced." "Young man: I only have two hands." "Courtesan: How vexing 《about to press closer but restraining herself out of consideration, doesn't press closer, starts smoking. The fire has gone out. Claps hands》" "Kamuro 《arrives》" "Courtesan: Bring fire, light it well." "Kamuro: Yes 《takes the fire container. From next door through the wall》" "《Neighboring courtesan》 You're having fun, aren't you?"
"Courtesan 《heard it but pretending》 What did you say? I can't hear anything at all."

To capture life in one's heart and embody bone method in one's brush—this is the way of painting.
Now, my disciple Utamaro creates works that capture the life of insects, and this is
true heart-painting. As a child, Utamaro was meticulous in all things. He would simply
playfully catch dragonflies and place crickets
in the palm of his hand to play with them, with no other thoughts in mind. Precisely because I feared he might
treat their lives carelessly, I admonished him many times.
Now this skill with the brush truly makes the virtue of his training shine forth.

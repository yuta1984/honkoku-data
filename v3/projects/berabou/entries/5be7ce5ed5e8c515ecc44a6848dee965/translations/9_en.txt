Heiji was originally poor, and at one time was troubled by demands from creditors over accumulated daily wages and shop rent. His wife, the mermaid, thought of using her poison to get revenge and earn money, but even for ordinary humans in this world as you know, it's impossible to scrape together even five mon. Being born in the Dragon Palace, she didn't realize that becoming a spectacle was a shortcut.

After much deliberation, she thought: "Ah, that's it! Though I am a lowly mermaid, how could my devotion to my husband be inferior to that of Umegae (a courtesan)? Her patron spends three hundred ryō, while ours is only seven or eight ryō. Even if it's just a nominal amount, it should be possible. Since there's no proper water basin at hand, I'll make do with a goldfish bowl, which is fitting for a fish."

With this single-minded determination, the mermaid forgot herself and tried to take up a ladle, but without hands, this was greatly inconvenient. As she hesitated, unexpectedly from behind, someone unknown said "The hands are here!" and helped her hold and raise the ladle - this was truly terrifying.

Such was the foolish course of events.

The sweet flag in the goldfish bowl can be seen floating on the water's surface.

In Kamo no Chōmei's "Hōjōki" (An Account of My Hut), it says: "The flowing river never ceases, yet the water is never the same. Foam that floats upon pools now vanishes, now forms, never lingering long." This was written in the old Kenryaku era, but even now in the Kansei period, it applies perfectly without even five percent difference. This is no lie.

The new pleasure quarters also return to their original flow - pools become rapids and rapids become pools, changing faster than peep shows change their displays. Such is the state of today's floating world, impossible to pin down. Well, that's fine. I didn't mean to sound so pedantic.

Now then, as described above, the Nakasu district, which until yesterday was a sacred realm of human affairs, has today suddenly become the theater of the Dragon Palace. So first, to firm up the waves, with permission from the Dragon King, they have set up sideshows, theaters, tea houses, and amusement venues. The prosperity rivals that of when it was a pleasure quarter.

Seahorse trick riding, flying fish tightrope walking, clams blowing mirages as a sideshow, octopus eight-man performances - all sorts of various entertainments are devised to squeeze out coins. The greedy hearts are the same, right down to the bottom of the water.

"I hear they're setting up a cutting show with nothing but pufferfish. I think I'll go fire off some guns too."

"Isn't a mirage just a candle sideshow?"

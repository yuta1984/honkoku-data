Now, when the fishing boat couple was in distress, Urashima Taro appeared, inquiring about love. He had the now-restored Heiji open the lid of the treasure box (tamatebako). As expected, through the virtue of the age-advancing treasure box, Heiji became just the right age—a mysterious man in his prime, like Kanpei-sama. Heiji was greatly delighted. This was like increasing with eggs and decreasing with water chestnuts.

♪The treasure box that was displayed at the Hachiman shrine in Fukagawa last year is precisely this one.

♪As for the mermaid wife, during the year when the young husband kept trying to touch her hands and feet, she shed her skin like removing hakama trousers, grew hands and feet, and became a true human being. This is quite far-fetched and strangely convenient.

♪Heiji and the mermaid lived harmoniously together, became wealthy, built a residence around Sakai-cho, and moved there. This place was called Ningyo-cho (Mermaid Town), but now it's mistakenly called Ningyō-chō (Doll Town) [present-day Ningyō-chō].

♪Unlike cicada shells, mermaid shells are rare, so he sold these to medicine shops, and Heiji made money beyond his property. When times are good, only good things come one's way.

♪You should protect each other for the future. Never doubt each other. However, don't rely too much on it either. Doron-doron, doro-doro-doro-doro.

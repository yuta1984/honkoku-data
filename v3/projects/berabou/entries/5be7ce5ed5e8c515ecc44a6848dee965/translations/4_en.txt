Thus, as Nakasu became the world of the Dragon Palace once again and prospered, before long beautiful tea house girls appeared. One was named "Shigoku" (Supreme) and made her living with goldfish and silver fish.

♪ Here again, most reverently, there is the second-generation Katsura Dragon King, son of the boss Katsura Dragon King of Tōryū Kūka, and as the male concubine of Princess Otohime, the Dragon King's daughter, there is Urashima Tarō, that handsome man known to everyone. His appearance is naturally beautiful, but even that beautiful Princess Otohime grew somewhat bored, and her heart secretly came to steal away to this Nakasu. At that "Shigoku" establishment, she fell mutually in love with a beautiful courtesan called Okoi of Tonegawa-ya, and they became the kind of lovers who say to each other "Let's die, let's die" and "Let's die together, let's die together."

♪ "Even if you speak so plausibly, since you're originally a fish, you must surely be making fun of me."

♪ "Because you doubt me so, I'd like to cleanse this heart and show it to you as a washed carp. I made an offering of one sweet to the immortal Kinkō. Even if this body were made into thread, roasted, torn apart and eaten, my unchanging heart would fly to you like the water of a waterfall dammed up within the Dragon Gate that I climbed with the temple bell. With the thought of becoming even a flying dragon, the love path of the Dragon Palace alone has become a deep relationship fathomless as the bottom of a thousand-fathom depth."

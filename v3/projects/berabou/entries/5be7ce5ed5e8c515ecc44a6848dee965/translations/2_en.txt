　　　Sincere
　　　　Address

First and foremost, regarding the matter of our shop, we are deeply grateful that all of you have shown us such generous patronage, and our business prospers more each day - truly a fortunate circumstance for which we humbly give thanks.

Now, the author Kyōden states: "Until now, I have casually created poor works of popular fiction for your viewing pleasure, but spending months and years on such unprofitable matters, wasting my writing brush on them, is truly the height of foolishness. Particularly last spring, when I received harsh criticism from society, I deeply felt shame over these matters and firmly promised to completely cease writing popular fiction from this year forward" - he made this solemn pledge to us as well.

However, if that were to happen, our shop, which depends on your generous patronage, would suddenly find itself in dire straits. Therefore, we earnestly requested that he create works for just this year at least. Since Kyōden has had a long relationship with us, he reluctantly agreed, bending his principles against his better judgment to create works for us.

Thus, new editions of sharebon (witty books) and ezōshi (illustrated books) have been completed. We humbly request that those who appreciate such works first examine our catalog and then make their purchases. That is all.

A certain customer came when the fish-person (uwonto) made her debut, and when the sleeping quarters were arranged, they made the inside of the folding screen completely dark, and someone dressed as a kuroko (stage assistant) extended hands from behind, lighting and offering tobacco. Though they tried to deceive with various gestures completely mimicking human behavior, the awful fishy smell was unbearable, so when the customer tried to flee, the mermaid handler wouldn't let him leave and grabbed his sleeve, chasing after him. The essential main attraction, the mermaid herself, had fallen carelessly asleep from the day's procession fatigue, so her hands were far away while her head was inside the sleeping quarters, thus revealing her supernatural nature from above.

♪Whatever the case, this courtesan is a monster. For her hands to reach from inside that sleeping area all the way here - what remarkably long arms!

The master of Maizuru-ya had an idea, and following recent trends, from the very first day things went wrong, and rumors spread that monsters appeared at Maizuru-ya or some such thing. So they couldn't keep the mermaid in the house even one day, and roughly estimating a loss of seven ryō and two bu, they called the human trafficker Heiji to hand her over.

♪Indeed, the expenses for the debut go without saying - it's Kyūdayū's own fault, he says - from costumes to combs and hairpins, summer kimono and folding screens, night robes and bedding, short jackets, braziers, tobacco trays, mirror stands, lanterns, long handles, geta sandals, chests, traveling trunks, printed bowls, pestles and mortars, clicking and clattering (sounds of the abacus) - who knows how much the loss amounts to! Like giving胡散 medicine to someone possessed by a fox, he speaks on and on about the mermaid's tail.

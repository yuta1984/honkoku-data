By the will of His Lordship alone, archery, horsemanship, and swordsmanship became extremely popular throughout the unified realm. Moreover, having heard that through the benevolence of Emperor Engi, people were allowed to wear monk's robes after casting aside their swords, everyone began wearing monk's robes - from Kukyo Tensho-jin in brown cotton Buddhist attire down to those below in brown Buddhist haori coats. Each carried a bow, and they would shoot and shatter anything hard with a "bowl" or "helmet" in its name - whether it be large helmet bowls from retainers' houses or antique shops, helmet bowls from pottery shops, anything at all - hoping to pierce through them like the votive tablet at Kannon temple.

【Dialogue of people who rushed into the pottery shop with bows】
"There's nothing to make a fuss about! If you complain about this and that, we'll shoot through the shopkeeper's head!"

"If you won't show us the pottery, well then..."

【Dialogue of the pottery shop owner】
"If my merchandise gets broken, I'll be in great trouble. Please, I'm putting my hands together and begging you, please have mercy on me!"

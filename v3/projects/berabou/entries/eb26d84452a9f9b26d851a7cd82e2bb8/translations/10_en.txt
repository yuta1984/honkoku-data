Those who practice horsemanship, having heard about Oguri Hangan riding the demon-black horse, mistakenly think it means practicing racing horses. Moreover, since fellow disciples know each other's temperament from daily practice when using wooden horses, it becomes uninteresting. They think that if they were to "ride" strangers they don't know, there would be various interesting reactions, so they go to the grounds of Kitano Tenjin shrine or to Yoshicho district.

They bring horse equipment and set up racing horses to practice horsemanship.

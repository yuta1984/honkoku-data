Oguri Hangan Kanetoshi was a master horseman who rode a wicked horse called "Oke" (bucket), so when teaching his disciples, since wooden horses cannot convey the true feel and balance of the saddle, he has people serve as wooden horses. This way, both parties can quickly grasp the meaning. The master and disciples take turns being the wooden horse, with one riding and the other being ridden for practice.

【Dialogue of people watching the horse training】
"Lord Oguri rides very well!"
"If it's the riding style of the powerful elite's palanquins, I could provide instruction in that"
"For the Hachijo school, these days even connections and favors are modest. Nowadays it's all about single-minded politics. It's all about martial arts first."

【Oguri Hangan's dialogue】
"The bell of Maitreya Buddha, the four-sided saddle. Upper is wicked, middle is skillful, lower is style. Indeed, all are essential secrets of our school."

【Disciple's dialogue】
"Is the master a large pot? The raised pot is a troublesome matter."

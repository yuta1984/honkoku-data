The disciples of Chinzei Hachiro (Minamoto no Tametomo) grew greatly in number, and among them, Kotaro, the son of Unno Taro, shot through a Nanban iron helmet at the age of seven. Since this was such an extraordinary feat, they made a votive tablet of his bow and arrow and dedicated it to Kannon at Kiyomizu.

"Well now, excellent archery skills at age seven! How remarkable! This is what Chinzei Hachiro Tametomo is all about!"

【Continuation of main text】
The disciples of Yoshitsune and Oguri Hangan heard this and it became a rivalry. Yoshitsune's disciples dedicated a tablet of "slaying a thousand men" at Gojo Bridge, while Oguri's disciples made horses gallop in the old martial style and dedicated their tablet. Among these three tablets, the horse tablet can only be seen from the painter's technique, which makes it rather a poor dedication.

Preface

The "Quli" (Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial) says: Though a parrot can speak well, it does not depart from being a flying bird. Though a courtesan can speak well, she does not depart from broken speech. {{Interlinear note: I}} may claim to create illustrated books, but never depart from mere imitation of others. They are like the myna bird, which resembles the parrot. Thus it is said.

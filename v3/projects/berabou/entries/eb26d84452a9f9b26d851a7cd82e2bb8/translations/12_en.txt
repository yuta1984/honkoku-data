Those practicing horsemanship didn't possess money trees either, and since they had spent everything on courtesan fees, they now had no choice but to indiscriminately seize men and women from the streets, thinking that if they could "ride" them, there would surely be various temperaments that would serve as good practice. So they wandered around the capital and its outskirts, and whenever they spotted men and women, they would violently and rudely push them down to "ride" them. This caused unprecedented turmoil, with fights and arguments never ceasing.

[Dialogue of a female servant whose mistress is about to be made into a "horse"]
"With sword and thousand moves, I won't let you escape even an inch!"

[Dialogue of a man trying to make a passing woman into a "horse"]
"What? Sword and thousand moves? Well, this tremendous strength - even if it's unexpected according to the government's edicts, practicing horsemanship, which is the foremost of economical tactics, is what we must strive for. How strange this is!"

[The Emperor, gazing at the city from his high palace]
"Well, well, what an outrageous state of affairs this is. Looking at this from afar, it very much resembles the scene at Yanagihara with its twenty-four mon coins."

Emperor Engi entrusted all governmental affairs to Minister Sugawara, saying that governing a great nation is like cooking small fish, and that the pleasure of great understanding comes from freely spending money. While he was drinking and gambling in the high tower of the Seiryoden Palace, the capital became somehow noisy due to this misunderstanding about horsemanship practice, so he composed this poem:

"Climbing up to a high building and looking down, I see the people's agitated behavior has gone astray."

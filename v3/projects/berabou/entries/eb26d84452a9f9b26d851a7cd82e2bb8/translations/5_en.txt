Chinzei Hachiro Tametomo, who shot through the chest plates of both Ito Goro and Ito Rokuro during the night battle of Hogen, was such a master archer that his teaching method is exceptional. Since archery on the battlefield targets people, there is no one who can remain perfectly still. Therefore, large targets or face targets are inadequate. So he summons people with holes in their bellies as shown in maps of foreign countries, dresses them in armor, hangs them up, and has them move around while practicing shooting through their armor.

【Dialogue of the person shooting arrows】
"Did it hit just right? Wasn't that the navel? Hey!"
"A new pleasure quarter opened up from the arrow pain in the navel, and writing 'That's it!' on the oto shop curtain is old-fashioned."

【Dialogue of the person with a hole in the belly】
"What a way to hit! If it's archery, even so, please excuse deep arrows by all means. My bowels can't take it. Master Bowels, you ask unreasonable things. Since my belly hurts around Yoshino, how about it, how about it!"

The part where they're hung and made to move is exactly like nankin puppetry (bunraku), sanba~

When I first read this book, I thought it was something that
slandered the sixth generation Ichikawa Danjūrō, but considering
the time period, it corresponds to the fifth generation. Perhaps
it relates to the upbringing of the fourth generation, or
concerns other people - this still needs to be considered.

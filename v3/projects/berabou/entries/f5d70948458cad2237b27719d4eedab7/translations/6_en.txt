Mankichi had become so arrogant about his learning and was acting extremely haughty, but at seventeen, putting on airs about "following one's heart's desire without transgressing propriety," he quit his studies and gradually began pursuing affairs with women. When he turned twenty, he had become a very handsome man, but the slightly concerning thing was that he had become a man whose nose was too high. With country-bred flatterers and others who excessively praised him, making his arrogance twice as strong, and since he grabbed money to spend on courtesans, he had an unlimited reputation as the greatest patron in Yoshiwara, not only in Naka-no-cho but everywhere.

"How early you have arrived!"

"So that is the arrogant big spender - what a high nose he has!"

From age fourteen, Mankichi began reading classical texts, and by fifteen, he was celebrated as having no equal as a scholar in all of Edo. His mentor gave money to a very wise person in the neighborhood, calling him a "great Confucian scholar" and had him teach Mankichi. This teacher was greatly pleased and praised Mankichi, saying he was "one who hears one thing and understands ten," and even when Mankichi made poor readings, the teacher would only say "exactly right." So when he gave lectures at fifteen, the local flatterers came to listen and made it seem like a large crowd was present. At this time, Mankichi's nose became of ordinary human height.

【Commentary】
Confucius said, "At fifteen I set my heart on learning," which means Confucius began his studies at fifteen. In this humble person's opinion, it was not such a rash thing as giving lectures at fifteen years old, as it appears.

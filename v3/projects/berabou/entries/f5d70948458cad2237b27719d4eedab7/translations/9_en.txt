Although Mankichi had lost at sumo wrestling, he became arrogant thinking that no one could match him in calligraphy and painting. So they had him compete in writing with that bean-tengu. However, since the bean-tengu was quite capable and not far inferior to Mankichi, the tengu scraped Mankichi's nose tip a little with his claws, and his nose became somewhat lower again.

【Mankichi's dialogue】
"I am defeated by this."

【Great tengu's dialogue】
"Well then, can you read this?"

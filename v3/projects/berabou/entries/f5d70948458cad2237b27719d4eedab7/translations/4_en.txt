From the age of nine, Mankichi began learning calligraphy and practiced writing, but he was actually very clumsy. However, his family and even the neighbors were given gifts to make them praise him, so everyone praised his handwriting and compositions as having no equal.

【Father Manemon's dialogue】
"At this age, there is no one who writes as well as my son. He writes quite fine characters indeed."

【Guest 1's dialogue】
"So you can do calligraphy? Well then, when you write something, I hope to see it again while I'm still alive."

【Mankichi's dialogue】
"This is poorly done" (speaking modestly)

【Guest 2's dialogue】
"Shall we say it surpasses even Wang Xizhi of foreign lands, and Fujiwara no Kosei of our own court?"

Those who praised Mankichi were treated to feasts and given money, so since they could receive things, they let their tongues run free and praised him excessively and endlessly.

At this time, Mankichi was ten years old, and again his nose grew quite tall.

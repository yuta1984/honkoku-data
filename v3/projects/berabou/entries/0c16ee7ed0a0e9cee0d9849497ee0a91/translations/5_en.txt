Female servants receive higher rice stipends than men.

"I shall prepare the needlework return items. I receive five ryō and three bu as my rice stipend."

"Were there any young masters at the place where you worked last year?"

"There were a young master and a young lady."

"If I could earn five or six ryō in rice stipend, I would have quit being a middleman long ago. Even so, the female servants are enviable."

In a year when New Year occurs three times, the daughter's child says "Please sew five kimonos for elder sister," while the son begs "Mother, please tell us a long story." Even the neighbor's child comes over saying "Auntie, please take us herb picking" as an outing, so all the sewing machine work that had been planned gets demanded all at once.

"But wasn't the promise that it would be when New Year comes three times?"

"Ah, this is starting to make me feel overwhelmed. I'll wait until New Year comes five times."

Masakado, believing that Hidesato truly intended to become his ally, decided to show off his quick techniques by preparing namasu (vinegared vegetables) for seven people all by himself.

Six shadow figures helped him from behind, but they were completely invisible to others.

At that time, Hidesato remained completely calm, took out a vegetable knife for shrine offerings from his pocket, and with his quick technique produced portions for eight people, completing namasu for eight people in no time. Since this was one portion more than Masakado's, he greatly deflated Masakado's pride.

【Masakado's dialogue】
"How impressive that is. With skills like that, you could work as a cook at a catering house."

【Hidesato's dialogue】
"My cooking doesn't require the heavy use of butcher knives like yours. The butcher knife is something to be wielded in the swordsmanship of Baba and Chiba schools. For daikon radish, smooth flowing technique - observe the finishing!"

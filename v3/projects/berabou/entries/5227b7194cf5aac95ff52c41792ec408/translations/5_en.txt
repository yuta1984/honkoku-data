Taira Shinno (Prince) Masakado desired the imperial throne and moved his court to the eastern provinces, calling it "Okabaseyo Dairi" (Okabaseyo Imperial Palace). He created mock imperial buildings like Shishin-den and Seiryo-den with officials called Obana-den and Umemoto-den, employing stand-ins for court nobles and giving them names like confectionery shops. Now in the eastern provinces, what schoolchildren learn as the "hundred officials" refers to this.

Hidesato thought deeply and hid all his retainers in the mountains behind, approaching Masakado alone for a meeting.

【Masakado's retainer's dialogue】
"We two are called Tawara no Kiyomochi and Kari-no-ue no Uwanuri. Please remember us from now on."

【Fujiwara Hidesato = Tawara Tota's dialogue】
"What strange names you all have. They sound like lacquered name plates from Daimon-ji-ya's account box."

【Masakado's subordinate's dialogue】
"Are you the famous Tawara Tota we've been hearing about lately? I'm well-versed in Konnyaku Island, so my name is Nanryo no Otaijin (Several-Ryo Rich Man). Please remember me."

【Fujiwara Hidesato = Tawara Tota's dialogue】
"I hear that His Highness the Prince is a master of quick techniques. I also have some skill, so let's have a contest of quick techniques. If I lose, I'll join your side. If you lose, shouldn't we destroy this palace and return home?"

【Masakado's dialogue】
"That sounds good. When you lose, you'll have to commit seppuku at your own expense."

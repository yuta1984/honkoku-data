Although Hidesato somehow defeated Masakado, believing it was due to the divine protection of Kannon of Asakusa, he tied the wild ox treasure sword to Motonobu, had him paint a picture on a horse, and dedicated a votive tablet.

Also, Masakado's spirit is called Kanda Myojin. The light of the seven luminaries (planets and stars) that shone night after night in Kanda at that time was the soul of this Masakado.

Cleverly connecting this into a two-volume work, all ends well.

Kinkin-sensei lived each day in extravagance and arrogance, and now his assets appeared to be nothing but debt, so his father Bunzui became greatly angered. Following the recommendation of his clerk Genshirō, he paid off Kinkin-sensei's debts and threw him out, leaving him in his original state.

The clerk Genshirō had initially incited Kinkin-sensei, made him spend large amounts of gold and silver, and pocketed all the surplus for himself. Therefore, stealing things came to be called "doing a Genshirō."

"Excuse me, sir, your rice cakes are ready!"

Kinkin-sensei had been thrown out and now had nowhere to turn, wondering what to do in complete bewilderment, when he was startled awake by the sound of rice cake pounding. When he looked around, it had all been a dream lasting only as long as it takes to cook rice, and the millet cakes he had ordered were not yet finished. So he gave Kinbei a slap to the side, saying, "In my dream I became Bunzui's son and enjoyed the height of prosperity, but even that lasted only thirty years. If that's the case, then the pleasures of a human lifetime amount to no more than the time it takes to pound one mortar of millet cakes." Having realized this for the first time, he immediately withdrew to the Pure Land.

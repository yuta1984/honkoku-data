Kinkin-sensei had exhausted all the pleasures of the northern provinces, so he set out for Tatsumi-no-sato (Fukagawa district), indulging in every form of sophistication. However, being a newly-made dandy, he didn't experience any particular downfall. Since even Amida Buddha's light was like gold, scattering yamabuki (golden yellow) colors everywhere, everyone praised him as "Kinkin-sensei."

"Ah, what terrible snow! Those who are no longer in this world must be so cold."
"The snow is like ducks flying and scattering in confusion, and people, even shrine maidens, come to enter the river. Ah, whatever will be, will be."

"Without even providing a palanquin in this heavy snow, the departure from Kagami-no is splendid. Though there are beloved ones in Tatsumi-no-sato, thinking of you, I will run on foot" - with such sentiment, they proceed timidly through the snow.

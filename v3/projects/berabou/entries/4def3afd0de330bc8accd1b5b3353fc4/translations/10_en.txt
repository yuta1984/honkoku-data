Somehow, Edo is bustling and lively.

Kinkin-sensei was greatly deceived everywhere, and now his former glory has completely faded. Those who used to visit and inquire about his well-being now pretend not to know him and stay away. Though he felt this was utterly mortifying, there was nothing he could do. Now lacking even the means to go out by yotsu-de palanquin, he finally moved to a cramped dwelling at the very edge of Hatchōbori, and alone and forlorn, he makes his way to Shinagawa night after night.

♪Until yesterday he was celebrated as Kinkin-sensei, riding stylishly in yotsu-de palanquins, but now he lives quietly in Hatchōbori. How the world changes when circumstances change! Ah, how regrettable it all seems now.

Palanquin bearers! Call out and let me board quickly!

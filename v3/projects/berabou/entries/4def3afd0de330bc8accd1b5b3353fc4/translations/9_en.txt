The teacher became infatuated with a courtesan named Omatsu from Tatsumi-no-sato, visiting daily and spending large amounts of gold and silver. However, Omatsu, following the customs of her profession, outwardly pretended to be deeply enamored with Kinkin-sensei, while secretly enjoying herself with another man named Genshirō, deceiving Kinkin-sensei behind his back.

The teahouse women send signals to mock Kinkin-sensei:
"Gekonkashurō sako sanke ga kiko naka sakai koto (coded language, meaning unclear)"
"Yoshi kae"

"Ikimaka ni ike ku ko kakura mako chike na koto ikitsukete kukon kena (coded language, meaning unclear)"
"Yoku itte kun nee"

Kinkin-sensei had been unaware of the situation until now, believing wholeheartedly in its sincerity. But tonight, finding Omatsu's behavior incomprehensible, he flew into a great rage and broke off with Omatsu.

"Omatsu-san, I don't care about you anymore - go over there! You're really an exasperating fool!"

"What should I do, how should I handle this? Just leave it be. I might as well go do some soot-sweeping."

"Well, master, you're in such a hurry. That's how the situation stands."

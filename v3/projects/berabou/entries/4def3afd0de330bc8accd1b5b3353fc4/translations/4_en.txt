Kinbei, overcome with hunger, was shown into the back room of the millet rice cake shop. As it happened, the rice cakes were not yet ready, and while waiting for a while, perhaps due to travel fatigue, he began to feel drowsy. He pulled over a hemp pillow that was nearby and inadvertently dozed off peacefully. In his dream, from somewhere unknown...

A palanquin from Hosen-ji temple appeared, with an eleven or twelve-year-old boy wearing black geta and newly-made straw sandals, along with numerous clerks and managers proceeding ahead. A clerk straightened his formal hakama trousers, arranged his dignified appearance, and spoke: "We have long resided in Hatchobori in Kanda, and are retainers of one called Izumiya Seizo. However, our master Seizo has gradually grown old and frail, and still has no heir. This year in particular, he shaved his head and changed his name to Bunzui, searching high and low for someone to succeed him. Fortunately, we heard that you wish to make your way in the world and have come this far. Relying on the divine protection of Manhachiman Daibosatsu, in whom our master constantly places his faith, we have come this far. We humbly request that you accept our master Bunzui's wishes." They forcibly placed him in the Hosen-ji palanquin, and mysteriously departed for some unknown destination.

"How delightful! We've finally found our young master."

"Leave it be. This must be what was meant by willingly rushing into danger."

Although Kinbei found this completely unexpected and very suspicious, he felt as if he had fortunately encountered the god of good fortune, and with a feeling as if he could ascend to heaven, he immediately got into the palanquin and set off toward some unknown destination.

Let me present a few examples from the old collections for comparison:

Four Seasons, Part One
　　　Beginning of Spring　　　　　Bonbongama
The tightly bound ice threads of the waterfall—
will the spring wind's hands loosen them today?
　　　Haze　　　　　　　Mitoku
The first rising haze-robe, one layer—
is it the mountain's undergarment or snow's white silk?
　　　Bush Warbler　　　　　　　Teikoku
Paying money in advance to learn the voice first, the bush warbler's

Lotus Sutra too, one volume eight verses round
　　　Young Greens　　　　　　　Mitoku
　　　　　In the snow
Roots are thin and do not spread their leaves wide
　　　Willow　　　　　　　Same
The string willow by the river where shamisen bridges are—
expressing its sound as waves advance and retreat
　　　Cherry Blossoms　　　　　　Kyōji
Not the tension point of a balance scale, but cherry blossoms—
not even one bloom catches the eye

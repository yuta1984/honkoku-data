　　　End of March　　　　　　　Teitoku
Today, no matter how much money I put in,
I wish I could make spring stay

Cuckoo, borrowing the name of Kuchinashi Plain,

Don't tell people that you came to my uncle
　　　Purification Ritual　　　　　　　　Jikaki
Between the coming autumn and summer　at the boundary,
the purification of Minazuki is performed

Fumizuki comes, rolling up and preserving the coolness

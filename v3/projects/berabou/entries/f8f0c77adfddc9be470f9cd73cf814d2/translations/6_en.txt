○ Generally, the dye colors and luster of hand towels and sweat cloths are expressed through the intensity of pigments, but there are differences between sunlit and shaded areas, and techniques like shibori (tie-dyeing) and crepe cannot be adequately expressed in woodblock carving, so they are omitted.

○ Although there are differences in dyed fabrics such as gauze silk, crepe, hemp cloth, and cotton, those that do not achieve gradated dyeing effects are omitted.

○ Although there are many towel racks with elaborate designs, it is difficult to draw them within the limited space of the pattern book, so those that are difficult to reproduce are omitted.

○ Since vermillion and blue colors are primarily used and arranged in this pattern book, please forgive any inconsistencies in their respective order.

Tago no Ura

Inagi woman
　Gōmeirō
　Flower fan
Various hand towels are being matched together
For today's duties, I would like to visit
even Suetsumuhana (the safflower lady)
But since I am like a sacred wand (ōnusa)
that sways with the pulling hand of eyebrow ink,
unable to follow my heart's desire,
even these mere playful activities - the morning mirror
clearly shows the situation

　Hanging hollyhock
Regarding the Aoi Festival, people hang
hollyhocks in their hair ornaments
and also hang them on bamboo blinds. This hanging hollyhock
hand towel is worn on the head by
joyful people and also draped over shoulders

Tōraiya dyeing
　　　　　　　Hanaran's design
The dialogue between shadow and penumbra is seen in Zhuangzi

penumbra with pattern

Water-drawing dyeing
Akoya net-pulling revision
Great orangutan banquet
　　Laughed at, dyeing the monk's head in persimmon color and exposing the bowl with a bleached hand towel

Originally we too do not know
About rhythm and dance, etc.

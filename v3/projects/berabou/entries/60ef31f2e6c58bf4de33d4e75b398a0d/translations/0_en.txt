【Absurd Tale No. 39. Since guild censorship became required before publication, it became difficult to write about Yoshiwara. So the author decided to publish this as a sealed book with "Instructional Reader" written on the cover, thinking there would be no surprise inspections from the magistrate's office. This was one of three volumes published in this manner. This incident led to Kyōden being sentenced to fifty days in handcuffs】

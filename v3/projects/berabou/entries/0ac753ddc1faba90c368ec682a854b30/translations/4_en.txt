The freshwater crab takes revenge

The monkey, unaware of the plot,
came to the crab's house
and tried to warm himself
by the hearth fire

The egg that had been
strategically placed beforehand
at just the right moment
burst and splattered

[Monkey]
Ah!
Hot! Hot!
So hot!

[Kitchen Knife]
The kitchen knife
waited in ambush
in the bucket

For burns,
you should apply
some water
Cut... [This appears to be part of the knife's action or dialogue, but the connection is unclear]

[Bee]
Oh no you don't!

Come on, come on
I'll sting you
It will hurt!

[Snake]
From now on
it's our turn
to feel jubilant
Let it bloom
beautifully

[Sawagani Hasami-no-suke's dialogue]
Look how well
today's
clever scheme
worked out!

Thanks to everyone's help
with that monkey,
what a satisfying feeling...

Everyone works eagerly
to capture the monkey alive

[Freshwater Crab]
I will [unclear text]
come [unclear text]
Look at how well
this crab performs!

[Seaweed, pretending to fall and grabbing onto the monkey]
I slipped on 
the seaweed
Please forgive me

[Monkey]
Kyaa!
Kyaa!

[Bee, since the stinger is on its rear]
I must turn
my back
to sting you
How painful
this must be!

[Monkey]
Ow! Ow! Ow!

[Pestle]
The heavy pestle
comes flying down
How very
painful
this must be!

[Mortar]
The mortar is
ready and waiting!

[Kitchen Knife]
The kitchen knife
waits ready
to cut the rope
and drop down

[Egg, waving a rising sun fan]
The egg rejoices
Everyone did
excellent work!

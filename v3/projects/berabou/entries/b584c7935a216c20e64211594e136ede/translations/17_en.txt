Ritarō gradually accumulated more and more evil spirits, and in addition to frequenting courtesans, he drank heavily and became violent, gambled, told lies, and was unfilial to his parents, so he was finally disowned. Now he had nowhere to place himself, and moreover, one night he cut and stole bedding from his parents' storehouse.

【Narrator】

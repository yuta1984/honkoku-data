The evil spirits, having made Ritarō into this wretched state through their own machinations, all pointed at him and burst into laughter. How detestable!

【Narrator】
Ritarō finally became homeless, and the evil spirits became even more emboldened. Now he had become a bandit and went to places away from human habitation to commit highway robbery. This was truly lamentable.

However, there was here a learned and virtuous person of great cultivation, particularly renowned in this benevolent world, who was known as a teacher of moral principles. One night, on his way home from giving a lecture, he encountered this bandit at this place. Having some knowledge of martial arts from before, he immediately captured him. But feeling pity for him, he thought to somehow instruct and guide him toward goodness, forgave his crimes, and accompanied him back to his own lodgings.

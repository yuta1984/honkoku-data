The evil spirits, satisfied, grew tired and entered the courtesan's bosom, falling into a deep sleep. At the same time, Ritarō became deeply concerned about matters at home, wondering "How did I come to be here? Why have I come to feel this way?" With a feeling as if awakening from a dream, he tried to return home without saying a word. However, disturbed by this commotion, the evil spirits awakened and declared "We must not let him return."

They immediately leaped into Ritarō's body, so his heart changed again and he decided to stay after all. At that moment, the good spirit managed to cut through the restraining ropes and rushed over with single-minded determination, taking his hand to try to bring him home. The evil spirits resist, saying "We won't let that happen."

When Ritarō is pulled to the left, he says "Ah, perhaps I should stay after all," and when pulled to the right, he says "No, no, I should go home quickly," going back and forth in the corridor, lost in indecision.

Since the forms of the spirits are completely invisible to ordinary eyes, the tea house attendant thinks Ritarō is a customer behaving improperly.

【Courtesan's dialogue】
Whether you're leaving or staying, just decide! How ridiculous.

【Evil spirits' dialogue】
This is like cleaning a well. Here, open your belly and straighten up!

Heave-ho!

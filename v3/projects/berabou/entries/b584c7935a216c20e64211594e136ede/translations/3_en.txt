Picture books are said to dislike overly preachy content, but now I shall make that very preachiness into a creative approach, compiling it into three volumes to teach children. If they can grasp these principles, even the chief of Tenjiku (the Buddha of India) would tuck away his expedient means and withdraw, and the uncle of Lu (Confucius) would sleeve his teachings and depart. If so, surely the deities of our country would also regard this as pure and admirable.

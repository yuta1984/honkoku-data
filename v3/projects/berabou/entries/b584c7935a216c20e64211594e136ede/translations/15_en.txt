Since the good spirit had entered Ritarō again as before, the affair with the courtesan seemed like a dream, and remembering it was so shameful that he simply settled his account and returned home.

However, when a persuasive letter arrived from that suspicious pleasure quarter and he casually opened it, the evil spirit entered through this letter and possessed him again.

【Tea house man's dialogue】
Receiving a letter from the pleasure quarters is something unheard of even since the age of the gods.

The good spirit struggles when shown the letter.

【From here begins the third volume】
As evil thoughts arose in Ritarō, the evil spirit seized this opportunity to cut down and kill the good spirit, satisfying its long-held grudge.

【Good spirit's dialogue】
How mortifying! How mortifying!

After Ritarō saw the persuasive letter that the pleasure quarter had crafted with all their skill, his heart became confused again: "Even if I spend three or four hundred ryō a year from my fortune, it won't hurt like a bruised fruit. I won't live for a thousand or ten thousand years, and when I die, I'll need nothing more than six mon coins. What I've been doing until now is pointless frugality. Doesn't the old saying go 'Why not take up a candle and make merry?' Using this self-serving interpretation," evil thoughts arose in him intensely.

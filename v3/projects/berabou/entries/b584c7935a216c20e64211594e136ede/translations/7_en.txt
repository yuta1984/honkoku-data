Here, near Edo's Nihonbashi, there was a greedy merchant named Ganzen-ya Rihei. When his wife became pregnant and gave birth in the appropriate October season, she had a jewel-like easy delivery, so his wife (kanai) offered prayers and whispered:

"The young are like white thread, able to be dyed in any way - this is indeed true."

Just as Rihei was trying to advance in making money, that distorted evil soul was about to enter the baby when the Heavenly Emperor appeared, twisted the evil soul's hand, and inserted a perfectly round good soul. This is because Rihei constantly disciplined his heart with single-minded devotion, so the Heavenly Emperor bestowed his mercy. However, it is pitiful that ordinary people's eyes cannot see this at all.

"Here, go without worry"
"Yes"
"Chon chon"
- this is the part where the rhythm is beaten.

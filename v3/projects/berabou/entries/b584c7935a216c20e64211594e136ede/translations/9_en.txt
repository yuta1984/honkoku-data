That evil soul tried to enter Ritaro's body, but after being reproached by the Heavenly Emperor, it had no place to rest. No suitable body appeared, and though it wanted to enter one, at that time the noble ways of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Shintoism were being practiced vigorously, and since all people held no evil hearts, there was no place for it to enter.

It was floating aimlessly in the air, but when the opportunity arose, it plotted to destroy the good soul in Ritaro's body and make Ritaro's flesh its permanent dwelling place.

【The following are the dialogues of the evil souls】
"What! Haven't we been circling around this group for the fiftieth time?"

"We want to buy the skin of a good body."

"These days, something called 'heart learning' (shingaku) is popular, so we're troubled that there are no immoral people to help us find a dwelling."

"Where the skins are lined up, it seems like the morning meal is about to begin. There's even an old woman who forgot her prayer beads for the million-fold recitation."

"You evil souls of those who met their end due to misconduct are wandering in the intermediate state (chuu)."

This is called "door-opening water." When the door-opening water flows down, birth-hastening medicine should be used immediately. It must not be used before the water flows down.

One should prepare good vinegar and a chipped vessel painted with lacquer. When after giving birth there is blood fainting (ketsuun) causing dizziness, put vinegar in a tenmoku bowl, place burning charcoal inside it, and have her inhale the fumes. It is also good to burn lacquered objects in fire and have her inhale the smoke. She will immediately revive and regain normal consciousness.

【Things to Keep in Mind When Approaching Childbirth】
When already approaching childbirth, each time the child turns, the abdomen will hurt intensely. Even if the abdomen hurts, if the lower back does not hurt, she will give birth.

㊃ About Shell Covering and Poem Cards

Playing shell covering is difficult unless you have memorized the Tale of Genji. Pictures from the Genji are painted on pairs of shells, and each half is made into a lacquered shell to be matched and taken. It should be called "kai-ōi" (shell covering), not "kai-awase" (shell matching). For poem cards, the poems of the Hundred Poets are written separately as upper and lower verses, with the lower verses made into lacquered cards, and players chant the upper verse to match and take the corresponding card. You should not say "strike" the poem cards, but rather say "take the accompanying pine."

When Taira no Kiyomori fondly parted from the Saigū of Ise, the Saigū sent him the upper verse of a poem written on a sake cup plate:
"Though the victor crosses, the bond remains unwetted"
In response, Taira wrote with ink on that same sake cup plate:
"We shall meet again and cross the barrier of Ōsaka"

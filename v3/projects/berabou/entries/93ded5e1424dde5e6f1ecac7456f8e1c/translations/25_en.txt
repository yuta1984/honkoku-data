Regarding the selection of dates: The day of the Tiger should be avoided. From the upper section of the calendar, days marked as "destructive" should be avoided, and days marked as "taking" should be used. From the lower section, one should avoid extinction days, black days, five-grave days (also called blood taboo or defilement taboo), solar eclipses, and lunar eclipses. For the time limit, in wedding ceremonies across different provinces, one should select and determine the day when the groom settles at his destination. For the day of departure from here, there is no need to consider good or bad fortune. For ceremonies in the same location on the same day, there is no such distinction. The actual day is considered an auspicious day.

The first long chest contains items for the water room shelves, the second long chest contains items for black shelves, the subsequent chests contain textile night items (including three pillows, one of which is a scented pillow). Now there are small-sleeve chests. The next long chest contains various hand tools, white long chests contain kitchen items (including hanging trays numbered one through three for the married couple). Next are wicker baskets, brooms, lantern stands, towel hangers, obi boxes, shell buckets - all in pairs, sandwich boxes, and one pair should be attached to the front of the palanquin items. Each item should have its ceremonial baton attached. The rear attendants for the items should be people of senior retainer rank. On the groom's side, people of senior retainer rank should also come out to receive the items. All should wear formal court dress. However,

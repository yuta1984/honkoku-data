Methods for Removing Various Stains

1. When oil stains a kosode (short-sleeved kimono): Add one gō of salt to one shō of water, boil well, let it cool slightly, then rinse. For embroidered fabrics or anything difficult to immerse in water, sprinkle talc powder on top, place paper over it, and press repeatedly with a heated iron to remove the oil.
However, this does not work on cotton. For oil stains on tatami mats, apply cooked rice mixed with saliva and place a weight on top. Sprinkling lime also works. For paper, sprinkle powdered earthenware.

1. For ink stains: Decoction of Pinellia tuber, decoction of Atractylodes rhizome, or boiled rice vinegar - any of these can be used for washing and will remove the stain.

Alternatively, wash with water held in the mouth while reciting Ono no Komachi's poem three times, and it will come off. This is a charm. The poem is:
"Without reason, what seeds have made these floating weeds grow thick in wave upon wave?"

1. For persimmon tannin stains: Wash with decoction of lamp wick, or with decoction of dried bonito flakes, or with miso soup, or with lye from hemp ashes.

1. For bird lime stains: Wash with the slime from loaches.

1. For tooth-blackening stains: Wash with boiled rice vinegar.

1. For blood stains: Thinly slice ginger and place it on top - the blood will transfer to it and come off. For white fabrics, moisten a lamp wick with saliva and rub.

1. For blood or oil from fish or birds: Wash with turnip juice.

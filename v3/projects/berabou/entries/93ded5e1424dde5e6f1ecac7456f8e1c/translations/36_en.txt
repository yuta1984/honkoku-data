㊈ On the proper way to drink sake with ordinary cups

Place the left knee down, cross the right knee over it, lean to the left, place the left hand down for support, take the cup with the right hand, hold it facing outward, bow the head slightly, and drink. For side dishes, receive them in your hand, fold paper napkins while taking them, put them inside, place them to the side, and carry them when you stand up. Do not place the cup you have drunk from on the stand. You should place it on the tatami to the right side of the stand. The sake server will take it and place it on the stand to carry it forward. When pressing sake on others, you should turn to the ladies nearby and say "Please partake." For lady attendants or familiar guests, you may speak to them directly. When taking side dishes with chopsticks, take just a little of anything that won't dirty your hands, and place the chopsticks pointing away from you. You must not place them pointing toward yourself.

9. On methods for removing all kinds of stains

Women's Treasure Record, Volume Four
　　　1. On practicing calligraphy, including writing letters

The concept of writing characters began in China when a person named Cangjie observed bird footprints and first created written characters. From this, writing characters by hand came to be called "imitating bird footprints." There are three types of characters: regular script (shin), cursive script (sō), and semi-cursive script (gyō). Softening the semi-cursive style, Kōbō Daishi created the "iroha" in forty-seven kana characters for the benefit of women. This is called women's script. If one can learn to write even the iroha, even an uneducated woman can read poems and tales to learn about the past, write letters and documents to communicate her heart, and manage her affairs. Therefore, when beginning to practice calligraphy, one should start with the iroha.

Women's Treasure Record, Volume 3 《Pregnancy Volume》
① On pregnancy 《together with》 the sequence of health maintenance

It is written in medical texts that women first begin menstruation at fourteen years of age, and men first begin producing semen at sixteen years of age. Therefore, in China, men do not take wives until they reach thirty, and women are not married to husbands until they reach twenty, keeping their vital essence firm and not allowing it to be carelessly broken, for fear of having no heir. In our country, there is no such law, and it is the custom for men to take wives at sixteen or seventeen, and for women to marry even at thirteen or fourteen. The higher the social status, the earlier marriages are conducted. This is all due to parents' hearts fearing that their children might commit impropriety, and that they might suffer from melancholy or consumption.

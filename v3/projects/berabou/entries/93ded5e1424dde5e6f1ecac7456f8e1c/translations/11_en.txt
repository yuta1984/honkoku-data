People say that udon and sugoroku are feminine, while soba-cutting and go are masculine. Women should never learn arts that do not suit them, even temporarily. In all things, there are matters that are suitable and those that are not.

◉ On Women's Speech (Supplement: Japanese Words)

The mother of the Chinese sage Mencius was wise and admirable. When Mencius was still very young, she moved their residence three times. At first, they lived next to merchants, so Mencius would only imitate buying and selling. Next, when they lived near a temple, he imitated burying the dead. The third time, when she moved their home next to a scholar, Mencius studied morning and evening and eventually became a sage. Therefore, even a sage like Mencius was influenced by his surroundings, so ordinary women should never be raised in close proximity to men. Women who grow up among men develop masculine hearts and speech patterns similar to men. When women use masculine speech, it is jarring and unpleasant to hear. Women's speech should be mixed with gentle expressions and soft. Using harsh, direct language is extremely bad. All words should be softened by adding the honorific prefix "o." 

Generally, these matters are recorded here for instruction.

Saying "retainers" or "servants" when one should say "household members" or "those below" is bad.
Saying "naigi" (wife) or "naishitsu" (inner chamber) when one should say "oku-sama" (honored lady) or "go-uchi-sama" (honored household lady) is too stiff.
Saying "the husband's man" when one should say "tono" (lord) or "go-tei" (honored master) is base.

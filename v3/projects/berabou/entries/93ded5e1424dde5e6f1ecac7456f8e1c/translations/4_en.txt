Complete Treasury for Women, Volume One
　①　On women being the beginning of humanity
After heaven and earth had already separated and Kunitokotachi-no-mikoto appeared, through the seven generations of heavenly deities, there was no distinction between male and female. From the seventh generation of the two deities Izanaki-no-mikoto and Izanami-no-mikoto, males and females became separate, and at the base of the floating bridge of heaven, they first married and gave birth to one daughter and three sons. The one daughter refers to Amaterasu Ōmikami, who was the elder sister of the three sons. Because her form shone with radiant light and was beautiful, she is called Amaterasu Ōmikami, and is also referred to as the Sun Goddess, ruling over Takamagahara (the High Celestial Plain). She descended to the lower world to rule over the land under heaven, and is revered as the ancestor of the earthly deities, remaining most sacred to this very day.

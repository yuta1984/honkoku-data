㊉ On various dining etiquette for ladies

1. Whether it be shichigosan, gogosan, or an ordinary meal, one should first eat the rice. For celebratory meals, the rice is served in large portions. On such occasions, the serving ladies divide and present portions for everyone. Take two or three chopstick-fulls of rice, then eat only the solid ingredients from the soup. You must not slurp the broth. Next, eat the side dishes from the left corner. Whatever the side dishes, you should eat the vegetarian dishes first. Then, eat rice again, eat only the solid ingredients from the second soup, and eat the second side dishes. You should eat one or two varieties of any side dishes. In particular, you must not reach across the meal tray to eat something far away. You must not eat two varieties of side dishes consecutively at once. This is called "migrating chopsticks" and is improper. It is acceptable to take up to two chopstick-fulls of any one dish. Whether rice or side dishes, you must finish what is in your mouth before eating more. You must not eat more while you still have food in your mouth. You should eat without making loud sounds. Grilled dishes should be torn apart by the serving ladies before presenting them. Even if you tear them yourself, you must not turn them over to eat the other side. Generally, you should not pour soup over your food. If you do pour soup over your food, you should do so before the hot water course. In this case too, the serving ladies should divide the food and pour the soup over it for you. If you pour the soup yourself, you should put down your chopsticks and pour with your right hand. It is improper to pour with your left hand while holding chopsticks, as men do.

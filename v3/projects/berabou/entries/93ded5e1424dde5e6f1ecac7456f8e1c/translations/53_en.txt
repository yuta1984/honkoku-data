This should not be done. She should hold onto objects and have someone guide her by the hand, walking firmly around the room. By doing this, the inside of the abdomen will relax and the child will turn more easily. When the child has already turned and the child's head approaches the birth canal, and when the hair touches the hand, she should embrace and push with one rhythm.

If she pushes before the child has fully turned, it is too early, and there will be difficult births such as breech presentation where the child is born hands first, or reverse birth where the child is born feet first. Also, if pushing is too early, when the crucial moment comes, her strength will be depleted and she will be unable to give birth. She should push according to the midwife's calls. Women who are to give birth should always listen and learn this. Otherwise, they will have difficult births unnecessarily.

After she has already given birth, immediately use the aforementioned Anshinsan (calming powder), and vinegar...

Scratch, close the eyes, lean against something high, bend the knees without extending the feet, do not lean against those standing nearby, and from time to time stroke downward from chest to abdomen. She should not sleep for long periods. When she sleeps for a long time, wake her gently. Do not wake her suddenly. She should eat white rice porridge.

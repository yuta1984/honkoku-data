In front, three earthenware vessels should be placed on rings. Instead of a water pitcher and ladle, a pair of pewter vessels with female and male butterflies attached to the spouts of the pewter, and pine and tachibana (bitter orange) should be attached. These are tied with mizuhiki cord. The procedure for sake pouring and accompaniment, the manner of drinking sake, and the order of cups are as before. For ceremonies of lower rank than this, formal etiquette is not required, and it may suffice to use lacquered cups with steamed kamasu fish as accompaniment and simply say "congratulations."

1. There is something called "iro-naoshi" (color change/costume change): after the formal san-gon ceremony is completed, the kosode sent from the groom's side is worn. The groom also changes into the kosode from the bride's side, comes out to the sitting room, and partakes of hitotsu-buna (single carp) soup, followed by another cup ceremony. From the bride to the groom's side are sent two kosode, an obi sash, tatou paper, a fan, and kamishimo formal wear. The groom should wear these that night.

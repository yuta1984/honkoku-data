【Fifteen】Procedures for the Newborn

When a child is born and falls, before it cries its first cry, wrap your finger in cotton and remove all the old blood from inside its mouth. If the old blood is swallowed, smallpox will be severe. Therefore, there should be two midwives at birth - one for the child, one for the mother. One midwife should not handle the duties for both mother and child. If there is only one midwife, she will first attend to the mother and leave the child abandoned on the straw mat, so during that time the child will swallow the fetal poison contained in its mouth together with its first cry, and will suffer from smallpox, sores, and such.

Not only did they conquer the inner Ezo territory, but Yoshitsune became the son-in-law of the great king and gained control of the entire Ezo nation, which was entirely due to Tankan's efforts. Therefore, many territories were granted to Tankan, and furthermore, Kamei, Kataoka, Ise, and Suruga were appointed to equal rank. Their prominence was limitless, and their retainers Jinshō and Uramin-teeru, along with In'orisū and Uenmei, were summoned to the mansion. They were told, "This time you worked together with your master in the campaign, which we find most commendable. Continue to serve well for our benefit in the future," and each was granted two rolls of kelp.

Tankan's two retainers were summoned while still in their cactus state.

The Ezo people said, "We have received such excellent promotion, each of us appointed to equal rank with the others. Not only that, but our retainers have also received rewards. It's wonderful - like Myōga of Shikoku," and Dankan spoke such nonsensical flattery.

"We who are not herring roe but kelp, to be appointed in such a manner is truly grateful - mountain kelp crows again."

Ise no Saburō, though young and a recent promotion, has an exceptionally good reputation among the Ezo people.

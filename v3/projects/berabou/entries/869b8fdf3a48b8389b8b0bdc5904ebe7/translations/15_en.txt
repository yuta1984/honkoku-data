Tankan collected all the kelp and herring roe from throughout Ezo, delivered one-tenth to Yoshitsune's storehouse, and embezzled the rest. Like lacquer, he luxuriously renovated his mansion without want and invited Lord Yoshitsune. This was a plot to get Yoshitsune and his retainers drunk with sake, kill them all, become the great king of Ezo himself, and make Kairan-fujin, whom he had long desired, his wife.

Lord Yoshitsune knew of such schemes from the beginning. He deliberately promoted Tankan and had him collect all the kelp and herring roe from Ezo, then announced that he would enter Tankan's mansion.

Tankan prepared the event of his lifetime, exhausting all manner of delicacies from mountain and sea to entertain Lord Yoshitsune. Yoshitsune, with his exceptional wit, used sake to get the retainer-king and all others drunk first, and while they were unconscious, he transformed the palace and towers made of kelp, even the clothing, all into chopped kelp, stuffed the stone walls of deer herring roe into bags, and restored Ezo to its original island state with exquisite craftsmanship.

♪ "Lady, that fellow Tankan with his potato-like head trying to woo you - what a detestable fellow. Dull people speak in riddles."
"On the 23rd night, put oil into this kelp."

♪ The retainer-king and other Ezo people were instead intoxicated by Yoshitsune's stratagem, and not knowing front from back, the drunken one was elevated.

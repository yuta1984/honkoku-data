Now, Lord Yoshitsune had apparently fallen out with his elder brother, Minamoto no Yoritomo (the Second Court Rank), and had gone down to Hidehira's residence in Ōshū. However, this was not actually a genuine falling-out. When stationed in Kamakura, being a younger brother, he would not be treated as equal to the great lords, and would need at least 400,000 to 500,000 koku allocated to him. Given these times of frugality, the wise Hidehira devised a plan: pretending there was a falling-out, he had Yoshitsune come to his residence. The scheme was that eventually Hidehira would give him all fifty-four districts of Ōshū.

♪ Lord Yoshitsune, being the renowned general that you know him to be, well understands both the situation in Kamakura and Hidehira's true intentions, but he pretends ignorance and acts carefree.

♪ Hidehira, being a shrewd old man who understands this plan, recommends an Ezo expedition as a way to gracefully escape without appearing disagreeable. Indeed, in these times of high prices for all goods, it would be difficult to support not only Lord Yoshitsune alone, but also his retainers like Kamei, Okai, Musashibō, Hitachibō, and Kyūchō as guests.

【Dialogue follows】
♪ This is the best plan of all! Let's go to Ezo territory and make a big success of it!

♪ Indeed, understood! Let's depart immediately. Preparations, preparations!

Since Kamakura's intentions are strong and they will certainly send forces against us, I believe it would be best to first retreat to Ezo island and conquer that island. I had anticipated this would happen and have already prepared escape tunnels from Tsugaru all the way to Ezo.

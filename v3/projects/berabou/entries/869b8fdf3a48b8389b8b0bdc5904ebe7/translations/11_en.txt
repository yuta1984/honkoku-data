Tankan, thinking himself fortunate to have gained Yoshitsune's favor, sought to advance his grand scheme by selecting beautiful women from among the Ezo people to present as offerings, encouraging wine and sensual pleasures day and night, and promoting his own plots.

Tankan said: "For me alone, in these mountains, as long as I have women and sake, I care not. Such schemes would work well in Shikoku too. Work hard for your own benefit!"

"The pleasures of human life are always wine and women. For these, in Japan there are gold and silver, while in Ezo there are kelp and herring roe. To fill the storehouses with abundant kelp and herring roe, we should first import large quantities of seaweed, sagara seaweed, and small fish from Japan. We'll exchange eight pieces of small fish for herring roe instead of kelp, establish official exchange posts for kelp and herring roe, and then order a complete sweep of all sea kelp and herring roe throughout Ezo territory. This would work excellently."

[Reading note 1 here makes the story easier to understand]

The storyteller Hōkaison says that while all plays are interesting, the Ezo people probably won't understand them. It only sounds like a professional storyteller.

Note 1:
Hitachi Hōkaison is one who will eventually become an immortal sage, so he occasionally practices by flying to Japan, visiting Yoshiwara, Sakai-chō, and other remarkable places. He returns to appear before Yoshitsune and tells stories. Among them, he's called a storyteller and is pulled here and there.

[Kaison's dialogue]
"Last night too, I told stories at Tankan-san's place until dawn."

[Main text continues]
Tankan presented many beautiful women to serve as companions in Lord Yoshitsune's bedchamber, intoxicating him with wine and sensual pleasures, arranging for him to become immersed in hedonistic corruption. He had long set his heart on this hedonistic corruption, and to seduce her from behind was most improper.

Lord Yoshitsune observed this behavior through gaps and increasingly saw through Dankan's (Tankan's) deception. "Very well, I'll expose him at the end of the third volume to his dismay. Unlike usual illustrated books that end with dreams, that would be unsatisfying. Indeed, to Hamamuraya and Otowaya, how grateful."

The hedonistic corruption was completely overwhelmed by Tankan and in great distress, saying "You serve a master," and though threatening him about improper behavior toward his lord, Tankan had grown thick-skinned and would not listen.

Whether speaking or remaining silent brings grief; in Musashi and Ōmi, all the women act directly at such times.

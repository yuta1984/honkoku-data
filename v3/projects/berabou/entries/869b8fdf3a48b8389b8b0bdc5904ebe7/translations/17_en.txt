Lord Yoshitsune, who seemed to have leisurely mounted the clouds and flown away to unknown places, actually returned to the shogun's residence in Kamakura, Japan, bringing with him a vast quantity of kelp and herring roe as souvenirs. The discord between Lord Yoshitsune and Lord Yoritomo, as mentioned in the opening dialogue, was merely for appearances. Lord Yoritomo was exceptionally pleased and had the kelp and herring roe sold at the Asakusa market, making enormous profits. This was divided equally, and thus prospered and flourished Kamakura mountain - how auspicious is this peaceful reign.

[Dialogue of the marketplace people]
"Lower the price! Lower it! Lower it!"

"It's expensive! It's expensive! The cheap items in this year's market are kelp and herring roe."

"Don't keep saying 'lower, lower' so much. Lord Yoshitsune has never been defeated."

Having climbed Umon-no-taki waterfall, they arrived in the interior lands of Ezo. It was truly a barren land with no sign of human presence and no place to lodge, so they brought kelp from the rough sea, built a temporary camp, and spent the night. The interior of Ezo is truly at the northern extremity, so the cold is severe, and only around June during the summer heat period does it become somewhat warm. All four seasons come at once, creating an indescribable landscape. The only problem is that there is no food to be found.

They use kelp as kotatsu quilts and eat it bit by bit as tea snacks.

【Benkei's line】
"It's not as tasty as confectionery kelp"

【Yoshitsune's line】
"This side feels like midwinter. That side is like the summer heat period - hot, warm, and quite smelly"

【Hitachibō's line】
"This place called Ezo is quite extraordinary. Half the body feels hot like summer heat, but when you think about it, the other half feels cold like midwinter"

This is what they truly call extreme seasonal confusion.

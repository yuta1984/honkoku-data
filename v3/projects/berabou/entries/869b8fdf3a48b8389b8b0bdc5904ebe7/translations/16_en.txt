When the Great King, Tankan, and other Ezo people awakened, they found themselves in an Ezo that had been made just like Japan, but by Yoshitsune's stratagem had become nothing but chopped kelp by the seashore, leaving them utterly bewildered. This was the true pillow of Tankan's dream, old one.

Though it seemed like summer, snow was falling, and through the changing seasons before their eyes, Kamei, Kataoka, Benkei, and Kaison were suddenly questioned. It was neither amusing nor anything else - how strange, how regrettable.

Lord Yoshitsune packed the kelp and herring roe he had prepared in great quantities into bales - tens of thousands of bales - and borrowing the power of Sōjōbō of Kurama, along with Lady Kairan and others including Hinaru, Kamei, Kataoka, Ise, Suruga, Musashibō, and Hitachibō, they all mounted the clouds and flew away.

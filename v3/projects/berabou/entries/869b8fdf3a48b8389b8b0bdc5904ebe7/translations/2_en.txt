Preface (Bold Declaration)

Now, the creation of kusazōshi (illustrated booklets) has six essential elements. The first is called "inspiration" (omoitsuki), the second is called "spirit" (iki), the third is called "execution" (deki), the fourth is called "effectiveness" (hataraki), the fifth is called "kaseki," and the sixth is called "hataki." For the past four or five years, I have refrained from writing kusazōshi and have secretly contemplated these matters. Through investigating the essence of things, I have finally understood these six elements and have come to create works in the highest style of unvarnished (natural) inspiration. Unu-unu (expressing self-satisfaction).

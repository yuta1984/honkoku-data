They easily conquered the castle, and when battle was joined, the Ezo warriors wore thick kelp layered several times over their bodies like the rattan armor of Jin Dynasty troops, using this as their armor. No matter how they cut or stabbed, weapons could not penetrate it, and Yoshitsune's soldiers were at their wit's end. At that time, Yoshitsune remained completely calm.

"From the ghost of Tomomori's perspective, this is just tea powder," he said, taking out the stored grilled carp and seasoning it with soy sauce mixed with sake and salt, boiling it in a large pot. When they ladled this broth and poured it over the Ezo warriors, they immediately became soft and began to retreat in defeat. Then Kamei, Kataoka, Ise, and Suruga shouted "Etariya-au!" and used chopsticks to pick them up and cut them, with the drinkers using them as drinking appetizers and the non-drinkers as evening meal dishes, thus killing them all.

Those who came forward were struck with overhead cuts, and when they circled around, they were cut down in spinning motions. "Cooking with carp costs ten mon, and soy sauce - how fresh it is!"

"Brother, it's old, old - so stale it's unbearable!"

"The general of simmered dishes, Kaison, works hard."

"Four o'clock at Akasaka Kōnya-chō, dripping down to Ochanomizu."

"Please push forward, finally!"

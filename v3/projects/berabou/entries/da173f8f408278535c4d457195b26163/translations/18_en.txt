Aotake Futaoki (Blue Bamboo Lid Rest)

Fragrant indeed
Perhaps in the evening garden
Cultivated chrysanthemums
With Somei's winter
As neighbor to the frost

Daiken Mon'in Toritsugi

More than ever
The sincere devotion
Of the youthful fond hoe
Is visible, and to the eyes
Of passersby - cultivated chrysanthemums

Whether joining the Sesshū school, the Tosa school, or the Hanabusa school, each competes in their respective skills. Among them, the Kitao family does not establish allegiance to any particular school or gate, but within their humorous style, they naturally capture the truth, following wherever their brush leads. Yet they do not forget the rules of painters, and their name was renowned at the time.

Commissioned by the publisher Maruya, they had the famous places of Edo drawn and copied, solicited kyōka (comic poems) from the favored poets of various houses, and named the work "Azuma Karage" after the cherry tree. Without the arts of Fei Changfang, when opened, this allows one to survey all of Edo's four ri in every direction at a glance, and when rolled up, it becomes a three-volume booklet.

Since paintings are originally songs of the heart, and songs are paintings of the heart, what could surpass this for the pleasure of armchair travel and quiet contemplation?

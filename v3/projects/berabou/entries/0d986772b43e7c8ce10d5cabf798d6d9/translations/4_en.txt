On the pleasure boats for cooling off on the Ryōgoku River, in the cabin quarters, long ago they used to perform kyōgen dances and such, but finding it too hot and stuffy, they set up platforms in pleasant moonlit spots on the sandbar boats, with all the entertainers coming out. Even when no one hires them specifically, sometimes they invite people to jōruri dance performances. People moor their boats around these performances to watch, and pay seating fees proportional to their involvement - this is the current fashion.

"Shishi-tora-ten's bugaku dance of the right guard, strike it, rapids, peonies, boto-chichin-to, ten-ten, hon-hon-ten, tsuku-ten, hiyaro-hika-chika-chika, hin-yaka-chiri"

【Dialogue of spectators watching from boats】
"The flute and drums aren't worth praising at all, no no."

"Bravo! Dancing, singing, playing! If you pay a good seating fee, then such praise would be appropriate."

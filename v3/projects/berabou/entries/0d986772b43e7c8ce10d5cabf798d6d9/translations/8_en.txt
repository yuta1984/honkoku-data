At that time, as the boss was becoming increasingly drowsy, a earth spider demon approached close by, and at the same moment, he struck off its leg with a Kutani pipe. From this time forth, it was named the "spider-striking pipe." However, when smoking tobacco with it, it seemed poisonous and unpleasant.

Taking that leg again, as a substitute, with a sashimi knife quickly, if one goes up swiftly, the horn becomes much cheaper, so if one doesn't act stylishly like this, it hurts terribly.

What a big stylish spider!

Here lived a pipe craftsman named Sumiyoshi Naiki at Ikenohata. Day and night he grieved over having no children, and while making daily visits to Urashima Shrine, he dreamed of eating an iron Kannon statue. His wife then became pregnant, and after waiting ten months for the birth, she indeed gave birth to two black iron balls - which seemed outrageous, but there are similar examples in China. It is said that famous swords were forged from such silver. Even if he forges various weapons, they are not popular these days, so he calls himself "Great Warrior" and devises various innovations, rejoicing greatly at the prospect of selling pipes made from iron needle divisions.

Originally, Urashima Daimyojin received a jeweled box from the Dragon Princess at the Dragon Palace. When he opened it, smoke equivalent to one puff of tobacco emerged from the box, and he instantly became a decrepit old man. Through this he learned the pleasure of one puff of tobacco. As time passed, he came to be revered as the god of pipe craftsmen.

[From here, the second volume begins]
The god Urashima arrives and strikes the anvil with the iron Kannon of Kudan.

"From heaven, from heaven, this body shall be set up in Takeda's mechanical puppet show."

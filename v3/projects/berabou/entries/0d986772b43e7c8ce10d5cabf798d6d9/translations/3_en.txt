The world has become quite refined, and even the sideshows at Ryōgoku Yamashita have no enclosures, displaying everything openly and showing things indiscriminately. Spectators estimate that the price should be about this much, drop coins into the money box, and watch the show.

【The sideshow mynah bird says】
"On rainy nights, well, to the Kohata gate, tetten tsun ton"

"Well then, let's go to Sunzen and have a suka festival"

The mynah bird chirps "meriyasu" (merino wool) and "shamisen," while the female initially chirps and uses "Otowaya" (a kabuki theater call).

【Audience member's dialogue】
"Otowaya! How wonderful! Bravo, well done!"

Those without money take side paths and pass by without watching the sideshows.

【Passerby's dialogue】
"Today I brought money but it won't be enough for my errands, so I'm broke, like a mortar..."

【Passerby's dialogue】
"I too have smelled the grilled river fish, so I've gotten hungry. If I smell it too much, I'll have to pay a smelling fee. Let's hurry along."

As a sign of nationwide peace, certainly, battles and such things exist in no era, so wakizashi (short swords) hang in tool shops like reed screens, strung together like dried bonito flakes. Since no one puts a price on armor and helmets, tool shop owners display them like signboards.

"If there's anyone buying wakizashi these days, that would be something! The world is wide - that fellow won't be able to help but jump with excitement."

"You there, what do you intend to do with that? Are you going to remake it into a kitchen knife and go out for some first bonito sashimi? My, what a sharp thing! You guessed right."

"How much does this Masamune cost?"
"Without saying, make it one hundred thirty-two mon."

"Since it won't sell anyway, I'll give you any discount."

"If you have a good laugh about it, I'll even give it away for free."

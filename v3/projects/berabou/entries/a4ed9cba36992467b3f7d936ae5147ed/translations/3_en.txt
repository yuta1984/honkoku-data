Also, one house away next to Shimaya, there lived a man called Tokudaya Shinemon. He too was a person of means in that area, so he lived without want, but moreover he doted endlessly on his only son who was six years old. According to common custom, when one person shows excessive favoritism, the neighbors tend to dislike it.

His wife felt sorry about this situation and went to Shimaya's monk (Gakujin), saying "I have no face to show before the retired master" as she repeatedly tried to give advice to her husband. However, he was deaf to her suggestions and left things as they were.

"Listen here, wife, all children are like this. What's this about that old man's teachings? I haven't heard what he says, but if it's about the way of loyalty and filial piety, who doesn't know that? If we follow the government's laws, there's no need to speak of or listen to lectures about loyalty and filial piety. There's nothing new about such obvious matters.

Surely that retired man wouldn't make such things sound so special either. He probably tells some other interesting stories, so that's why people go to listen. The boy will become well-behaved when he goes to his teacher next year, won't you, son?"

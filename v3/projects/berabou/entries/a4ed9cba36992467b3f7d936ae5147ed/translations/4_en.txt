Shinemon was, as usual, an argumentative man, and being a proper merchant, he believed in Daikokuten (the god of wealth). Every morning without fail, he would offer sacred sake, and eating only black bean rice until nine o'clock, he would stay up alone, repeatedly praying: "For my son's health and longevity, and for his continued growth, so that he may not be foolish, and though he has a runny nose now, may he not be a snot-nosed child in the future—I humbly beseech you for this alone."

Then, miraculously, Daikokuten appeared and said "Excellent, excellent, I am here," without any pompous airs, speaking quite familiarly.

"Shinemon, your wishes are different from those of worldly people. You don't ask for material things, but only speak of your son this and that. From my side here in the house, it's becoming difficult for me too. It's clearly troublesome. However, since you ask, I won't refuse, but particularly for you—with your natural forehead wrinkles all bunched up—I have an invisible cloak and an invisible hat. I'm not exactly giving these two items to you, but I'll lend them for a while, so try wearing them," and he handed them over.

Even Daikokuten, after all, just looked like a heavy, aged figure.

[Shinemon's dialogue:]
"In return for this favor, please ask me for anything at all"

[Daikokuten's dialogue:]
"It's presumptuous to mention food, but the black bean rice is too hard—please excuse me from that. Shake the sake bottle well and offer it properly"

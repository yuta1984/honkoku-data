Following the crows, I arrived at what appeared to be a government office for birds, where various petitions were being heard. Roosters involved in fights were scolded on both sides of the dispute. For sparrows in rice fields and quails in millet fields, it was decreed that they must not take anything except what had fallen and scattered - nothing more should be taken. As previously instructed to geese and ducks, simply eating what farmers have labored to produce is unacceptable. However, the scattered portions are precious grains, so these may be consumed freely. Woodpeckers are strictly forbidden from anything except dead trees. There was a suspicious inquiry about bush warblers playing in cherry blossoms.

A kite was seized and bound for interrogation. The bird official said: "You have been strictly instructed repeatedly, so what is your understanding? You have been stealing tofu and fried tofu. While there may be times when you must eat such things, you do this daily out of your own greed. You also intend to snatch fish from fish sellers, and when you snatched a four-mon coin thinking it was fried tofu, you not only grabbed tobacco pouches, but also scratched a young elephant's hand, and were found in possession of grilled eel from the 'Sanbyaku' shop. All these crimes have been exposed one by one. Due to your bold audacity, after investigation of each of your evil deeds, you shall be placed in a mandarin orange basket, handed over to outcasts, and displayed in front of people's houses."

Ikkyu would daily prepare pond snails mixed with fish as side dishes, cooking and eating them. In that neighborhood there were also temple patrons who found this distasteful and thought, "Let us go and admonish him." Two or three of them conspired together and stealthily followed him. When they looked, they saw him boiling raw octopus and eating it with ginger vinegar. The temple patrons thought this was exactly what they should criticize, and when they tried to admonish him, Ikkyu said, "All the fish I eat have attained Buddhahood. Come tomorrow and see - I will bring back to life all the fish I have eaten and spit them out to show you." So everyone grumbled and went home.

The next day, a large crowd gathered, saying "Let us see Ikkyu spit out the fish he consumed, alive as he promised." They came in great numbers hoping to witness this. When Ikkyu said, "Indeed, I shall turn the fish into Buddhas through my mouth and spit them out to show you. Behold!" everyone said "How wonderful this is!" and watched without taking their eyes away. At that moment, though Ikkyu had always been able to spit out the fish he ate from his mouth and turn them into Buddhas, today for some reason, though he tried to spit them out again and again, nothing came from his mouth. "Alas, these fish will not become Buddhas after all," he declared, and everyone left in complete bewilderment.

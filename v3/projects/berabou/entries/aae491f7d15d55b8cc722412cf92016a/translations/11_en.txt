Ikkyu climbed Mount Koya and was gazing at the world when the monks of that temple came out and mocked him in various ways. They said, "What are you lingering here for? The scenery is quite interesting, and I think I shall compose a poem." A certain foolish child said, "How can poetry come from the monk's mouth? How absurd!" and laughed. "Very well then," said Ikkyu, asking for paper and brush, and taking up the brush, he remembered how Du Fu composed poems in the shape of mountains at Jinshan Temple, and composed poetry in this manner. The monks of the temple were shocked, and not understanding such things, spoke rudely. First begging his forgiveness, they asked, "What is your name?" "I am called Ikkyu." "Ah, so that's who you are!" They offered to provide hospitality and earnestly requested him to stay overnight, but saying "Farewell, farewell," he fled back home. When they persistently asked him to write a eulogy for a portrait of Kobo Daishi, he said "How troublesome!" and for that eulogy wrote: "Kobo Daishi, the living Buddha - when he dies, he becomes soil of the fields."

[Mountain-shaped poem]
Mountain autumn leaves fall
Mountain spring flowers bloom and fade into emptiness
Mountain welcomes connected peaks, announcing Buddha-mind also
Mountain high, near Tusita inner court, earth advances into emptiness  
Mountain quiet, expressing the hidden treasure world, earth smells of tranquility
Mountain level, deep source transforms Buddha's troubles also
Mountain summer cool wind, troubles tranquil
Mountain winter scene snow

[Eulogy for Kobo Daishi's portrait]
Kobo Daishi (Great Master Kobo), living Buddha
When he dies, he becomes soil of the fields

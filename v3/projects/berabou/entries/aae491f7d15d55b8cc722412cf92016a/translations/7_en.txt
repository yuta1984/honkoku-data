During the New Year celebrations from the first to the third day, when the townspeople of Kyoto were bustling about making their New Year rounds, Ikkyu carried a skull pierced through on the tip of a small bamboo stick and went around saying to everyone: "All people will become like this. The three realms are only one mind (sangai yui isshin), outside the mind there is no other dharma (shinge mu beppō), mind, Buddha, and sentient beings (shinbutsu kyū shujō) - these three are without distinction (ze san mu shabetsu). Be careful, be careful!" As he walked around Rakuchū carrying this, people said "How truly inauspicious this is!"

"Oh my, oh my!" they said, avoiding him and scattering away. However, those who were devoted to the Buddhist teachings said, "Ah, Ikkyu's teaching is truly precious and grateful."

A widow living near the Imadegawa River came to Ikkyu's hermitage bringing offerings, saying it was Buddha's memorial day. The priest said, "Oh my, how admirably and well you have come to visit!" He entertained her in various ways and served her sake and food. Afterward, Ikkyu firmly grabbed this woman, saying "Body and soul, life-taking - that refers to you, my dear! Come now, let us share dharma teaching and a night's pillow together!"

He tried to forcibly pull the woman in and assault her. The woman was shocked, broke free, and fled in panic back to her own home.

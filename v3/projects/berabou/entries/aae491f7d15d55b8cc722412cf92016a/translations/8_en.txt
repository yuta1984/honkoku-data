The wife returned home and told her husband exactly what had happened. He said she should divorce and never meet Ikkyu again. The husband said, "No, that would not be right. You should follow the priest's wishes. In this sacred gate, I have no jealous heart."

"If that is so," said the woman, and she turned back again to go to Ikkyu, saying "I will follow your wishes." But he was already resting, and though he had had such intentions earlier, now he no longer wanted to. "Go home quickly," he said. When the woman returned and told her husband this, he said he had sent her knowing that this shame would reveal the priest's true heart.

In Sakai, a man named Matajiro ate fugu soup and eventually died. Since he had been on intimate terms with Ikkyu for some time, they invited Ikkyu and requested that he perform the funeral guidance. Ikkyu replied, "No, there's no need to go and give a sermon. I'll send this written piece instead - use this to read and bury him." He sent it as commanded. They did as instructed. This written funeral guidance was treasured as a family heirloom, said to last until the moonlit nights (forever).

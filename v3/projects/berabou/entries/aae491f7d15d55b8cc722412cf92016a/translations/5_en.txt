As Ikkyu gradually advanced in years, he set out on a pilgrimage to various provinces. When he was in the area of Tsuchiyama at the bottom of the slope on the Tokaido road, a main hall for the Seki Jizo Bodhisattva had been completed, and when they requested Ikkyu to perform the eye-opening ceremony, he said it was "a simple matter."

He chanted these four verses:
"Bodhi and klesha (enlightenment and delusion), the universe within sleep, whether sleeping or waking, ultimately alone"
"Buddha speaks no falsehoods"

Then, using his own old loincloth that he wore around his body, he wrapped it around and around the head of the Jizo statue, tied it with rope, and said "There, this is good," before departing. All the people of the post town said, "This is quite sacrilegious recently. What a thing to have asked such a worthless monk to defile the Buddha statue!" A large crowd set to work washing it clean and threw away the aforementioned old loincloth.

That night, the Jizo Bodhisattva appeared in the dreams of people throughout the town and village, giving this divine message: "Yesterday a venerable monk performed the eye-opening ceremony, but you have caused me distress by washing away what should not have been washed away. If you do not restore it as it was, it will not be well." So they hastily sent messengers to request Ikkyu again and restored it as it had been, whereupon there were no more curses.

[Voices of people washing the Jizo:]
"Wash it well!"
"Throw away the loincloth quickly!"

【From here, the first volume】
In a place called Murasakino in Kitayama, the capital, there is a Zen temple called Ryuhosan Daitokuji. Its founder was the great monk Daito Kokushi. Among the thirty-six sub-temples, there is one called Shinjuan, and during the reign of the 101st human emperor, Emperor Go-Komatsu, there was a monk called Ikkyu Osho. The life story of this monk, who achieved enlightenment in Japan following the heart doctrine of Bodhidharma, is recorded in this illustrated book as follows: This Ikkyu was the son of a court noble (hokumen) in his youth, and was an extremely playful monk. However, his depth in Zen learning was remarkable, and he displayed various forms of wit. He passed away at the age of eighty-eight.

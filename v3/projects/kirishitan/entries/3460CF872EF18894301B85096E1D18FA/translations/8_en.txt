　　　The matter of Christians and their sect members all being captured
Regarding this, the townspeople of Rakuchū, those in back alleys, nuns in rental houses, around Myōshin-ji temple, the outlying lands, the border areas - although they conducted thorough investigations everywhere, many harbored [Christian faith] in their hearts and only pretended to apostatize. At that time, the Kyoto Deputy (Shoshidai) Itakura Iga-no-kami Katushige devised various stratagems, but since these beasts were honest fellows, once they accepted [the faith], they would never turn back. Because they did not value their lives even as much as a dewdrop, and since they spoke of it purely as a matter of the afterlife, they could not be reached even through crimes of theft or robbery [as threats], and [Itakura] was troubled wondering what to do.

All these reasonings should be understood as true. When that time comes, tormented by the pain of illness, with mind unable to control the body, in a time of extraordinary disorder, what sense is there in waiting for divine grace? Moreover, what extreme danger do you think this represents? Who could successfully appeal that divine judgment? What sense is there in now wasting the time when you have leisure for yourself, living in vain? Now is the time of opportunity. This is the season when things conforming to God's true inner testimony can come to pass. As Isaiah beautifully proclaims: "Seek the Lord when He may be found, call upon Him when He is near."

•【Marginal note】This appears in Isaiah 55. When it is possible to see that Lord, now He is able to hear our petitions and render judgment.

Know that for those who do not seek grace, even when the time of salvation arrives and they see Him, He shall not hear their cries at all.

Chapter 3 《Subheading: Concerning Those Who Rely on Heaven's Mercy but Do Not Cease from Sin》
Here there are people who, taking Heaven's mercy as their foundation and relying on the Passion of the Cross, do not reform their evil conduct and live with peace of mind. This delusion must be cleared away. There are those who say, "Did not Heaven hang on the cross precisely for evil people? Since He is truly a Lord of vast mercy, how could He abandon us?" While this is also true, you are one who uses that divine compassion as a refuge for committing evil. The Lord destroys sin.

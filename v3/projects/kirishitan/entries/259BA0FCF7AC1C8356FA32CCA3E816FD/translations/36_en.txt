Regarding San'nosuke's performance at this time, his spirit and excellence would not have been inferior to when his grandfather Ichinosuke thrust the leading spear at the Battle of Ōjō. Thus San'nosuke was carried away on his retainer's shoulder, but as they passed where Lord Ogasawara Shinano-no-kami was stationed, someone challenged them and tried to make him remove his helmet. Then Shinano-no-kami sent a messenger saying: "Whose retainer are you? Even in military campaigns, even for the wounded, one must not neglect proper etiquette toward us." So he replied: "I am called Shimomura San'nosuke, retainer of Arima Genba-no-kami. I rushed to the vanguard and struck down four or five enemies, and we too were wounded." Lord Shinano-no-kami said to his attendants: "It is essential to pay attention to the wounded.

You should approach Shimomura and praise his deeds." So several men attended San'nosuke and said "We are deeply impressed by your efforts." Then San'nosuke came before Toyouji, who said: "Quickly return to your quarters and tend to your wounds." Before long, there was an order for Tadasato to lead the vanguard, and he subsequently entered the castle and erected his banner at the tatarai in the second bailey. That day too, Toyouji wore armor on his body without fastening it, rode in a palanquin, and entered the castle through the Ageminato gate, establishing his position behind the walls of the second bailey.

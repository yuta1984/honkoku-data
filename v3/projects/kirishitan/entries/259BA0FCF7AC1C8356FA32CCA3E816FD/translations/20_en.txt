The news that [Nabeshima's forces] would charge in was overheard by two retainers of Matsukura: Takahashi Izaemon and Kuwano Magobei. They advanced from the guard post of the siege works to near the first bailey and took position at an elevated spot. Ichikawa Heibei from Kuwano's unit was also there. Okamoto Shinbei came to this place and, feeling uneasy about the news that the Hizen forces would charge into the outer bailey, was observing the situation when the rōnin Murakami Kyūzaemon arrived and went to Shinbei, asking "Should we charge quickly from here?" Shinbei replied, "It would be best to coordinate with the Hizen forces." When Kyūzaemon said again, "If we wait to coordinate with the Hizen forces' charge and end up being late, what then?" Kuwano Magobei heard this and said, "Understood. It would be regrettable to let others take the lead," and

immediately pulled a single bamboo bundle to the opening of the horse guard, emerged from between them, and was the first to charge into the second bailey. Takahashi Iemon also followed and charged in. It is said that Kuwano claimed to be first, with Takahashi following. When they entered inside the fence, there was a fence about six feet high. Kuwano leaped over this fence. Takahashi was shot with a rifle while climbing over the fence. It appeared that forces were gathered seven or eight ken ahead from the huts beside the fence. In the plaza where about seventy or eighty enemies were positioned, Kuwano alone charged in. With an earthwork about two feet high placed in the middle of the passage, the enemies took cover and fought. Sano Koheiji followed in Kuwano's tracks and engaged in close combat. Others who came included Sugiyama Gorobei and Murata Sakuemon

According to the memorandum of the Namikawa clan, on the 27th day of the 2nd month during the general assault on Hara Castle, four musket commanders—Tazaemon, Yamada Magodayū, Watanabe Yojirōemon, and Yokono Kan-no-jō—were off duty within the bamboo fortifications, each staying in their huts. Tazaemon had his horse washed at the salt beach behind the huts, returned to his hut, washed his hair, performed ablutions, and was eating rice when he heard the sporadic sound of muskets from the direction of Nabeshima-dono's position. As it became clear that "the attack is beginning," forces deployed from the main camp to various attack positions.

The four musket commanders also formed battle lines under Hyōgo-dono's command and awaited orders. However, since there was a prohibition against attacking without official orders, inspectors and commissioners were dispatched to all units. Sone Sanjūrō-dono and Sugihara Shirōbee-dono went to the Terasawa forces, but since the vanguard had already begun the attack, the orders became meaningless, and everyone attacked. Tazaemon's younger brother, Namikawa Dan'emon, achieved the first entry (though at that time his name was Toda Shichidayū, aged seventeen), and this feat was recorded as being "speared through." Nakae Yosazaemon, Shimada Jūrōzaemon, Yamada Tarōbee, and Yanagimoto Gorōzaemon followed in succession. Since that location was considerably higher than the flat ground, it was clearly visible from all directions, but aside from these five men, no one else attacked from that position simultaneously. Now, while the men on duty within the vanguard's siege works were gradually attacking, Tazaemon observed from about two chō behind, and without concern for distinguished service, he immediately attacked with his ashigaru in tow.

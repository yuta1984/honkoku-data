was because Hosokawa's forces were stretched thin, allowing the people of Amakusa to escape to Hara Castle, which led to this uprising. Hosokawa claimed he would block the attack routes where the Amakusa people were besieged, but this was not feasible. Moreover, Hosokawa did not return the siege works (engineering equipment) that were provided to both families' forces. This matter was entirely due to Etchū-no-kami being summoned through your personal connections." When this was said, Lord Izu-no-kami replied, "Your thoughts are quite reasonable. This matter should be reported again." 

Afterward, when Tōshū (Izu-no-kami) arrived in Edo, perhaps because news of this situation had somehow reached there, he was unable to obtain an audience. At that time he was called Hida-no-kami, but upon his arrival he was immediately summoned before the shogun, who said, "I have been eagerly awaiting your return to the capital. Report on the situation at Shimabara."

Lord Munetaka reported: "This time you sent the young Izu-no-kami as your representative, and I wondered how this would go, but in all matters his conduct was truly admirable. Izu-no-kami will provide the details. In any case, your discernment, my lord, is remarkable and truly awe-inspiring. I have grown old and frail, and may not serve consistently throughout." The shogun responded: "So Izu handled all affairs well, is that so? Is there nothing remaining to be done?" He then declared, "Then I shall grant him an audience," and immediately Izu-no-kami was granted an audience. Thus Tōshū received great favor from Lord Risai.

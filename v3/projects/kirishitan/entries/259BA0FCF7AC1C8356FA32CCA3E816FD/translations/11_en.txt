From the Renchi pond area, forces under Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami entered during the night. Because it was nighttime, they constructed a palisade there and waited for dawn. Rather than a general assault that would break military protocol, although not limited to Etchū-no-kami's forces alone - with soldiers from various units and rōnin intermixed - since it was Etchū's attack position and moreover involved large numbers of troops, the honor of first to enter on the 27th day went to Hosokawa. At the same time, forces entered through the main gate and pressed forward to the wooden gate of the main keep's inner compound, but the enemy defended firmly and would not allow entry into the castle interior. Afterwards, Hosokawa sent a messenger saying: "We have taken the main keep, constructed palisades to prevent enemy escape, struck down those remaining on your side, and achieved complete victory of the castle, so please withdraw and return." The reply sent back was: "We acknowledge your message and will withdraw, but there

may naturally be some who escaped being struck down. Tonight we shall spend the night at this location." To other units that received reports of the castle's fall, similar replies were given. From past the fifth hour of the night (around 8 PM), Arima Genba, Tachibana Hida, Ogasawara Ukon, and Mizuno Hyūga came together to Izu-no-kami's camp position. This was because there had been good advance instructions regarding the swift fall of the castle. These were congratulatory words over celebratory cups. "Now please withdraw and rest your men and horses," they said. To this also came the same type of reply.

The Bansei Family Genealogy states: On the evening of February 27th, Sakakibara Saemon charged from the outer bailey and struck down rebels. Hida-no-kami of the same family also charged in and set fires. From then, all units attacked together in unison. Jūzō was present at Saemon's camp.

were executed. Among the survivors, Yamada Uemonnosaku was spared and taken into service by Lord Matsudaira Izu-no-kami, going to Edo. Four people were taken by Lord Kuroda Uemonnosuke to Chikuzen: Hanzaburō (son of Miyake Jirōzaemon, a warehouse magistrate who had been stationed at Kuchinotsu by Lord Matsuura Nagato-no-kami), his three brothers, and Kumanosuke (son of Ōhara Jihei).

The reason these men were executed was that they had killed a samurai in Sankai village and killed a magistrate in Obama, so they were punished in this manner.

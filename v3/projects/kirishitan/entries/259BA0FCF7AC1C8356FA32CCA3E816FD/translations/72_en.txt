Records of the Suppression of Christians, Volume 34

February 28th, Mizunoe-Inu (Water-Dog year)
According to the memorandum of Matsudaira Izu-no-kami regarding the Shimabara campaign: On the early morning of February 28th, fire arrows were shot from Hosokawa's forces to set the main citadel buildings ablaze. The area captured on the evening of the 27th was only about 20 to 30 ken (approximately 36-54 meters) of the main citadel and narrow outer bailey, while the main castle still held thousands of enemies of unknown number, who held out until the 28th. On the same day, during the late hour of Mi (around 11 AM), Kuroda Uemon-no-suke, Kuroda Kai-no-kami, and Kuroda Ichimasa charged in from the rear approach of the main citadel to attack. Additionally, reinforcements charged in from various points of the main approach, and by around the late hour of Uma (around 1 PM), everything was completely settled. Izu-no-kami and Samon were stationed at the second and third baileys.

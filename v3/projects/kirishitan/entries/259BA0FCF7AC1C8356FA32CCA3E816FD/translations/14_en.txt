Arima Genba-no-kami's siege position was at the eastern edge of the outer bailey, so there was a watchtower in the space of about one or two ken near the walls of the outer fortress. On February 27th, when Denzō had climbed up that watchtower and was stationed there, he saw Sakakibara Hida-no-kami storming in from the outer bailey. He put on his armor and headed toward the outer bailey. However, although the second bailey was also nearby, for some reason Denzō went around to the third bailey and entered from there, resulting in many casualties from gunfire at the second bailey.

It is also recorded that Hayashi Tamba-no-kami had come as an inspector to Matsudaira Uemon-no-suke's position. Uemon-no-suke's assigned sector was a place called Ōeguchi.

Ōeguchi was at the western end. Tamba-no-kami's camp was at a place called Hinoe-guchi (C-gate), and Hinoe-guchi was at the eastern end. Although the distance between Hinoe-guchi and Ōeguchi was said to be eleven or twelve chō, there were many hills and slopes with winding paths, so it was probably about fourteen or fifteen chō. When Hayashi Tamba-no-kami saw that they had stormed in from the outer bailey and set fire to the second bailey, he prepared his weapons and went to Matsudaira Uemon-no-suke's position. However, Uemon-no-suke was unaware that the attack from the outer fortress had begun. Then Tamba-no-kami gave commands, and Uemon-no-suke's forces stormed in from Ōeguchi to Amakusa bailey. Given this situation, everyone surmised that other sections should also immediately storm in.

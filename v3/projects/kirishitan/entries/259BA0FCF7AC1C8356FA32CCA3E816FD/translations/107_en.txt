Saku was a man who lived in Kuchinotsu within Shimabara domain. When rebels rose up at Shimabara Castle and all the people of the district were drawn into Hara Castle, during the fall of the castle on the 28th day of the 2nd month of the following Tiger year, Uemonsaku was tied up with rope at Matsuyama of the outer bailey. He was captured by Ogasawara Ukon-no-taiyu's forces and handed over to Matsudaira Izu-no-kami. Upon immediate investigation, it became clear that he had been secretly communicating with Arima Saemon-no-suke through arrow messages, and this was thoroughly investigated as described above. However, because of his loyalty, his life was spared, and when returning from campaign, Izu-no-kami brought him to Edo and subsequently placed him under Izu-no-kami's custody. Later he became a monk and took the name Yamada Yūan,

and went down to Nagasaki to live there.
　However, he died of illness in the first year of Meireki. Uemonsaku had brothers who all lived in Ogawa-chō, and his nephew Yamada Tōbei continued the family line in Ogawa-chō until the tenth year of Genroku.

According to the "Buke Jiki," Hosoi Rinsei (lay name Kisaburō Masanobu) and Noma Nyoshō (lay name so-and-so) showed courage and merit from beginning to end. Nyoshō died in battle on the 28th day of the 2nd month. Both warriors were originally retainers but fled for some reason.

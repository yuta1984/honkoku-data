Among those who fought, there was not only one man named Soga Kyūdayū, but many others. I also ordered my young retainers to take down two or three (heads). Before the hour of the Dog (around 8 PM), fire broke out in the huts of the main bailey, and the flames spread even to the ashigaru of the vanguard. However, since the rear forces were pressing forward, they could neither advance nor retreat, resulting in great difficulty. At this time, someone from Ukon's side hung a straw raincoat on the tip of a spear and held it out to prevent the fire, whereupon the enemy fired their muskets incessantly. The fire spread to a distance of about ten ken from Ukon Shirō's house, and they defended by wielding palisades until dawn. From the house where Shirō was stationed, young women joined hands and leaped into the burning flames of the huts, and many died by fire.

【Records】
According to the records of the Ōmura Kansuke house, on the 27th day of the 2nd month of the Year of the Tiger, before the fourth hour (around 10 AM), ashigaru forces attacked the main bailey from the position held by the Hizen forces, and thus the entire encampment was captured.

According to the memorandum of Harada Iyo, on the 27th day of the 2nd month, during the general assault, Arima Saemon-no-suke ordered Hyōgo-no-kami to attack from his siege works. However, Iyo reported directly to Saemon-no-suke that "not a single man from Hyōgo-no-kami's siege works can be sent to attack." Since Saemon-no-suke redirected his cavalry, the attack was carried out from Nabeshima-dono's siege works.

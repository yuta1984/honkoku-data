Whether Kaki had died or regained consciousness, he reported to Shigenori and withdrew. Next, Fukuō Hanbee and Kimura Shinzaemon reached below the wall and fought, but were wounded by stones and withdrew after reporting to Shigenori. Yagyū Shinzaemon reached below the wall and died in battle. Higashi Gidayū fought and reported to Shigenori, who whittled a branch and gave it to him. Later he was appointed with a 300-koku stipend under Lord Hōjō Dewa-no-kami. Afterwards, Lord Masuyama Danjō became castle commander. Besides these, there were many wounded and killed among the rōnin troops, though details are unclear.

According to the Matsudaira clan records: On the 28th day of the second month, Inoue Seibee-no-jō positioned himself ahead of the advance troops within the main bailey, appearing ready to fight if the rebels came out. However, since the rebels did not emerge, nothing happened. When Inoue Chikugo-no-kami was sent from Edo to Shimabara, he was granted a pair of ceremonial swords as official equipment. He intended to achieve merit in battle using these swords, but this did not come to pass, and he returned without any military achievements. It was like entering a treasure mountain only to return empty-handed.

Because of this, public opinion held that Chikugo-no-kami's fortune as a samurai had perhaps run out. However, since he was a senior official or inspector, the matter was discussed among the Gosanke (three Tokugawa branch houses), and his reputation was preserved.

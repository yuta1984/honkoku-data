Shinano-no-kami was observing from atop the constructed hill with Matsudaira Izu-no-kami and Toda Samon, but when the decision was made that there was no need to use messengers, everyone gathered at Samon's camp. When there was a council of war for the general assault on the following 28th day, regarding Shinano-no-kami's advance guard, masterless samurai (ronin) Shinohara Gen'emon, Tasaka Saemon and others said it would be reasonable to go observe the inside of the outer bailey. Agreeing with this, Shinano-no-kami's house representatives Tashiro Mago'emon and the same Genta Saemon, along with two or three others, entered the outer bailey to observe. Sakakibara Saemon was present at the same location, and when Hida-no-kami's retainers who entered afterward looked, they wondered whether Hida-no-kami remained on the constructed hill where everyone had climbed up. When his retainers came to report this situation, Shinano-no-kami hurriedly ran to the siege works and gave the order "Mount the attack! Mount the attack!" Shinano-

no-kami's advance guard warriors wondered what they should do. Since Hida-no-kami was an inspector (metsuke) attached to this unit, why should there be any dispute? Therefore, everyone rushed in without even taking up their weapons properly, and some even entered half-naked. Although Saemon and Gen'emon advanced to the front of battle and fought well, perhaps because they were masterless samurai, they were not included in the official record of Shinano-no-kami's retainers who led the charge. When these men advanced into the second bailey, Hida-no-kami and Saemon were said to be at the usual corner on the right side inside the outer bailey. Nevertheless, advancing as direct shogunal retainers and entering the outer bailey early, they were perhaps credited with the first breach.

It is also said that on the same 27th day, retainers of Nabeshima Shinano-no-kami went from the outer bailey to the second bailey.

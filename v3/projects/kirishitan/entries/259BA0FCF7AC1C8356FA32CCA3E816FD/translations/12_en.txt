Because they were far from the castle, they arrived late. The rebel forces had gathered in the main keep, and soon night fell. Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami constructed a palisade on the eastern side of the main keep.

Record of the deeds of Kurosawa Sadayū and Kishi Hanemon during the Shimabara Rebellion
On February 27th, when we had entered the second bailey, Jūzō-dono ordered Sadayū to take up and carry the standard. However, I reported that it would be difficult to handle it since enemies were nearby. Jūzō-dono said, "No, climb up. You have been given this order because your dedication has been observed. More than any distinguished service, this shows your loyalty, so if you display this standard ahead of mine, it will show that the imperial envoy's standard is present there, and the various forces will see this, so carry it." I complied with his wishes. At this time, Tachibana Sakon-dono also entered together with us. Then

I received the standard, found bamboo to use as a pole, raised it high, and kept the standard erected in front of Jūzō-dono that night.

Also recorded: On the 27th, at Toda Saemon-dono's hut, everyone had gathered to decide the schedule for the castle assault. When Jūzō-dono also came and was seated, we heard news that forces under Nabeshima had stormed the castle. When everyone departed, Jūzō-dono called for his helmet, but his helmet-bearer was not present, so Kishi Hanemon hurriedly ran back toward the hut. On the way, he encountered the helmet-bearer, received the helmet, and rushed back again.

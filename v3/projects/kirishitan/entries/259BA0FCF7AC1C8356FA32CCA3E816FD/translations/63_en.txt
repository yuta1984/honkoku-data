It is also said that on the 27th day of the second month, at the early part of the hour of seven, when various forces pressed their attack on the main keep, the castle defenders resisted, and as the day grew late, it was deemed difficult to capture it that day, so the various forces withdrew. However, Tachibana Muneshige, leading the Miike forces, entered through the attack route after Lord Hosokawa's vanguard had withdrawn. Seeing this, the Higo forces turned back and, together with others, pushed back and entered. The various rōnin who came to our house and others, as well as members of various houses who witnessed this event, all say that on the 27th, the first to mount the main keep was Lord Tachibana.

Afterward, Sakon-sama inquired of Hida-no-kami: "Since Muneshige's forces were the first to storm the main keep, convey this matter to Izu-no-kami's side." The reply was: "In such assault operations, regardless of who is involved, discussions of precedence are quite difficult matters. It naturally fell to Hosokawa's side to take the enemy commander's head. If that is the case, it sounds like competing for glory. If one becomes negligent in fighting while focusing primarily on gaining reputation, it is an unsettling thing.

Making much of small matters is something that discerning people would find inappropriate to hear. Particularly, if only Sakon-sama had participated in the campaign, that would be understandable, but for one of advanced age to boastfully proclaim such minor achievements as meritorious deeds seems unbecoming. You must certainly keep it that way." Because this was declared, no further discussion...

The forces attacked and approached the fence, attempting to immediately take the main bailey, but the rebel party in the main bailey desperately defended this position. Above the foundation, the main bailey had stone walls, and there were two extremely steep areas within the cliff face. When our men tried to climb over these areas, the defenders threw from within the castle: musket fire, stones, burning dried wood and grass, and even pots and stone mortars, defending fiercely. Our wounded men fell five or three ken down and were struck down as they fell, this happening three times. Naturally, under the side fences there was no progress at all, and at the long cliff areas, they were struck by stones in succession, wounded and falling back. Since they could not advance at all in this manner, numerous deaths occurred. In the rear formation were Lord Tadatoshi, Lord Mitsutoshi, Lord Izu-no-kami, and also

Lord Yokome Saburōzaemon was stationed with this force. Because there were too many wounded and dead, the envoys held a consultation about withdrawing the forces. However, at the late hour of the Cock, the vanguard forces under Nagaoka Sado of Lord Tadatoshi's command stormed into the main bailey from the sea-side corner without pause. At this time, Masuda Saisuke set fire to the entrance. It burst into flames at the hour of the Cock, and immediately a dispatch was sent to the inspectors in Funai. The document stated:

"We reported earlier by urgent message. We stormed the second and third baileys at seven o'clock, set them ablaze and cut down the enemy. We stormed the main bailey at the hour of the Cock on the same day and set it on fire. Everything was completed at once, which we consider most auspicious. As you can see, there are many wounded. We do not know the situation of the other forces."

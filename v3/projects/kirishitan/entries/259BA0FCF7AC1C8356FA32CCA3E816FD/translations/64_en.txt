was done.

It is also said that when Muneshige appeared before his lordship, Hida-no-kami declared: "This time, it was a rare feat of arms befitting you. After Hosokawa withdrew with his large force, unable to mount a successful attack, your decision to circle your troops thinking the enemy would let their guard down was good judgment. If this becomes a matter of dispute with people saying 'since he attacked from someone else's attack route, it doesn't count as his attack,' it would be extremely troublesome. However, without going too far, considering the enemy's carelessness is a military custom. If you say from your attack position 'by all means, let us attack here' and achieve victory, that becomes the victory." Such was his lordship's opinion.

The Hankanfu's annotation states: When the castle fell, Matsudaira Kai-no-kami Teritsuna spurred his horse alone toward the castle. His father Nobitsuna became greatly angered and ordered a retainer named Iwagami Kakuemon to stop him. Iwagami hastily stood before the horse and said, "With respect, Izu-no-kami serves as the Shogun's deputy with unparalleled devotion, and therefore he strictly controls his men so that the various armies do not compete for the lead. All the more so, for you as his son to break ranks and compete for the vanguard would be inexcusable. He certainly orders you to stop," and as such a messenger approached, he turned the horse's head back. Teritsuna would not listen and tried to spur his horse forward.

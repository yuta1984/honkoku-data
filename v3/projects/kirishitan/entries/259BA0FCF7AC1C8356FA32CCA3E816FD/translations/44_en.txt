However, Chotsugu remained in the castle town, determining that he should prevent the enemy troops from advancing, and after staying for a while, he withdrew to the rear formation.

According to a separate text, the Ogasawara genealogy, on February 27th, Nabeshima Shinano-no-kami's forces attacked the rebel castle. At that time, Ukon-no-taiyu broke through the bamboo bundles of Terasawa Hyogo-no-suke, who was positioned in front of Shinano-no-kami's camp, and immediately entered the second bailey. The rebels fled in defeat and retreated to the main camp, where they were pursued, and the outer bailey of the main camp was captured. The rebels tried to defend against this, but Ukon-no-taiyu and Shinano-no-kami rushed to the vanguard at this time and broke through the main gate of the main camp's front entrance. Tens of thousands of troops gathered at this entrance, and on the following 28th, the rebels all perished in defeat.

According to the Nabeshima family records, Shinano-no-kami gave orders to construct large observation towers at three positions in his assigned area, equipped with stone mortars and large firearms, which were fired frequently. As a result, the rebels could not hold their position and abandoned the earthworks of the outer bailey, retreating to fortify the earthworks of the second bailey. Therefore, on February 27th, Shinano-no-kami consulted with Lord Izu-no-kami and Lord Samon about surrounding the walls of the outer bailey and constructing approach works for an attack. Immediately that day, both commissioners and all the generals climbed the observation towers to survey the situation and observed that the rebels appeared to be withdrawing from the outer bailey. Accordingly, as Shinano-no-kami had proposed, it was decided to surround the walls, advance shields, and construct palisades, with the castle assault to begin the next day, the 28th, with all forces attacking simultaneously.

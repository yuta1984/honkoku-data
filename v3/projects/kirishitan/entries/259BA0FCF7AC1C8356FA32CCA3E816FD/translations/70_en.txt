I write to report that the castle where the rebels had barricaded themselves was subjected to a general assault today, the 27th day, at the hour of the Sheep (around 2 PM). The third bailey, second bailey, main bailey, the outer bailey of the second bailey, and the outer bailey of Ōeguchi—all were successfully stormed and set on fire without exception. Since evening has come, all forces have immediately established defensive positions in various parts of the third and second baileys and remain on guard. As I am writing this letter from within the castle, I will report the details tomorrow. Please also inform Lord Itakura Naizen-shō, Lord Matsudaira Shinano-no-kami, and Lord Ogasawara Tōtōmi-no-kami of the above. Respectfully and humbly submitted.

Furthermore, please send this letter to Edo with all haste. That is all.

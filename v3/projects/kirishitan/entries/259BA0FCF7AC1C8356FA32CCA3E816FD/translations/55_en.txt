repeatedly tried to climb, but some were thrust down with long spears and others were struck down with stones. Though that entrance seemed difficult to capture, after Sakon's men climbed up and raised Sakon's banner, not once did anyone retreat. They defeated the enemies at the base of the walls and captured the walls as they were. Sakon himself also entered the inner citadel. At that time, among Sakon's banner men, there were those who were wounded, killed in battle, or died fighting. Since Ishitani Jūzō-dono witnessed this situation, there is no need to report the details.

According to the military record of Inaba Jirōemon: "On the 27th of the second month, various daimyo who had assembled at Arima gathered at Toda Saemon's place for a war council regarding the castle assault. At that point, Nabeshima-dono's advance forces

climbed onto the walls and set fires, so forces rushed from the encampment to the predetermined position. At Saemon's location, the daimyo of the assembly immediately rushed to the receiving position."

Also it states: "Jirōemon, attached to Kuroda-dono's advance forces, charged out toward Amakusa-maru. However, the enemies of Amakusa-maru were quickly scattered by Kuroda-dono's advance troops, and the remaining enemies retreated into the main citadel. Jirōemon showed no slackening at all and aimed for the main citadel. Between Amakusa-maru and the main citadel, he engaged the enemy in combat, pressed forward and took a head. This was the first head taken among Tango-no-kami-dono's forces."

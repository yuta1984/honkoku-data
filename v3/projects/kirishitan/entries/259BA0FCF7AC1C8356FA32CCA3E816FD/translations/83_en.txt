The Kuroda forces claim that they were the first to breach the main bailey, but this is unknown, and there are already many similar claims.

Dankai says: On the 28th day of the 2nd month of Kan'ei 15, year of the Earth Tiger (1638), from the fall of Shimabara Castle in Hizen Province, the heretical believers who had been besieged became an army of over 37,000. Various things about the night attack at that time:

In the spring fields, all bearing bodies of complete dedication
The enemy is steadfast, holding hope as Christians

Until now the swordsmen had been composed
Now Naizen runs about frantically  
Jūzō who charged blowing the conch shell

First concealing the immediate shame in a spring-like manner
Not attacking but also involved with the Arima front
Even two or three times, will not retreat
Come now, though the vanguard advance
Those who say nothing lack courage
No matter how much you press Kii-no-kami, it's like a pot
Of no use in Kai, such is Shinano's kindness
Lord Hyōgo, is even the sword at your waist from Amakusa?
Arranging the hats to enter Terasawa
Though I thought Hosokawa was an excellent school

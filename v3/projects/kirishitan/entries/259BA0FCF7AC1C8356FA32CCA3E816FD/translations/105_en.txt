He was secretly taken into service by Nabeshima Masanori, and later served Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami Tadaoki, becoming Bitō Kin'emon with a stipend of 3,000 koku. During the fall of Shimabara Castle, no one approached the base of the main keep's walls because intense gunfire was being directed outward. At this time, Hiratsuka Kanbei, a rōnin from Kishū, advanced alone with his sword drawn and approached the wall. Bitō also approached wearing a light crimson ōbukuki (campaign coat), and together with Hiratsuka, without looking back, they attempted to scale the wall. From inside, they were severely attacked with spears and naginata. When Bitō was weakened after having a spear thrust into his mouth, he was pierced through the middle and finally died in battle. Similarly, when Hiratsuka attempted to climb like Bitō, he was struck down by a spear and appeared to be dead. However, Uchimi Shōdayū from the Hosokawa side rushed forward and struck down the enemy who had knocked down Hiratsuka from inside the wall, thus saving Hiratsuka. Hiratsuka rose again, approached the base of the wall, and his performance was incomparable. This Kanbei was the nephew of Hiratsuka Inaba-no-kami Yoshinari from the time of Lord Hideyoshi. Uchimi Shōdayū was the grandson of Ura Hyōbu Munekatsu, a former retainer of Kobayakawa Takakage. Since both were descendants of distinguished warriors, they were much talked about at that time.

According to the "Mikawa Monogatari," when many high-ranking officials gather in one place and give orders from behind without properly observing the front lines, it becomes the laughingstock of the realm. According to the lord's will and regulations, even if one is prepared to die in battle, one must never engage in careless and unnecessary charges.

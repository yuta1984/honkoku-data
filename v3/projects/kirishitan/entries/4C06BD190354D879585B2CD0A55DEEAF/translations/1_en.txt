　Refutation of Christianity

1. Regarding Christian teachings: There is a great Buddha called "Deus" 
   who is the lord of heaven and earth, and the one Buddha of complete freedom.
   This is indeed the creator of heaven, earth, and all things.
   This Buddha appeared in the Southern Barbarian lands sixteen hundred years ago
   and saved all sentient beings.
   His name is "Jesus Christ." Other
   countries do not know this, and it is foolish
   to meaninglessly revere and worship Amida Buddha and Shakyamuni.

He tried to climb but was shot through the forehead by gunfire and fell backward from atop the ladder. Shuden also climbed up afterward but was thrust down and suffered spear wounds. Squad leader Murakami Shiroemon, seeing those retreating from the base of the walls, held his spear horizontally and shouted "Push forward and climb! You samurai, you beasts, don't let them retreat even one step!" but was struck by gunfire and died instantly. Fellow squad leaders Watase Shogen, Rikuta Jinnosuke, Shibuya Gorohachi, Toda Kageyu, and Yamazaki Tarohyoe also encouraged their subordinate soldiers and competed with each other to be first up the walls, but Watase, Rikuta, Shibuya, and Yamazaki were wounded, while Toda fortunately escaped the arrows and stones. The chief gunner Shirae Sakuzaemon, Dorokin Hyoemon, Iinuma Yoemon, Ono Daigaku, and the ashigaru commanders of the vanguard - Mabuchi Kahyoe, Naka Zentaro, Nishizawa Sakonemon, Yagyu Hachiroemon, Suzuki Hyohyoe, Miura Sozaemon, Yamaguchi Shinzaemon, Kajimura Shichihyoe (Shichiemon, deputy commander) and others - led their ashigaru units in a fierce attack on the rebel castle. Some were struck by arrows and lost their lives, while many others were wounded. Among them, Shirae quickly reached the base of the walls and achieved a glorious death in battle. This Sakuzaemon was fond of Zen and had written the phrase "advance one step from the top of a hundred-foot pole" on the silk of his banner. The day before, when Arima Naiki saw this, he said "You have written a very thoughtful verse," to which Sakuzaemon replied "I humbly add shame upon shame to my back banner."

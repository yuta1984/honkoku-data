To carry out the starvation siege, they attached bamboo bundles to construct palisades all around and fortified the strategic points to complete the encirclement. As provisions ran out within the castle, the defenders attempted to go out from the eastern main attack point to gather seafood and return to the castle, which was observed by Lord Etchu-no-kami. Lord Etchu-no-kami had left the palisade at his assigned sector open, waiting to capture alive any escapees who might come. When many escapees did come, he captured them. Among those captured were men who had joined the siege from Shimabara, so when he inquired in detail about conditions within the castle, they reported that both arrow materials and provisions were exhausted.

According to the Shimabara Yōbun-ki (Essential Records of Shimabara), Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobutsuna and Toda Samon Ujikane joined the campaign at Shimabara, and as various generals arrived successively at that location, attack sectors were immediately allocated to all forces. Consequently, each received their assigned attack point and constructed their camp positions.

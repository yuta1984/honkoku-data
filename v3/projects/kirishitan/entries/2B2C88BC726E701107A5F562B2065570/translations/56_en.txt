Chronicle of the Suppression of Christians, Volume 19

According to the Record of Heroic Deeds, on New Year's Day, when horizontal clouds were just beginning to drift across the sky, Matsukura fired signal flares from his fortified position. Simultaneously, five hundred matchlocks of the Kurume forces fired in unison, raising battle cries. They formed a horizontal battle line across an area about seven to eight ken wide, surrounding the target. Tadamura also crossed the bamboo bridge and set up his field desk on elevated ground, issuing rapid-fire commands and frequently ordering "Attack and take it quickly!" The vanguard and the main force were separated by only about fifty ken. However, since it was still dark before dawn at this time, it appeared as though the vanguard had already rushed into the castle.

New Year's Eve, Day of Kaneshi (Jiazi)

According to the Bansei Family Genealogy (Ishitani Jūzō), since the siege works of all units had been positioned close to the castle, roads had been constructed to access points, and preparations for a general assault were complete, orders were issued to all units on the last day of December to carry out a general assault on New Year's Day.

According to the Amakusa War Chronicle, on the last day of December, various commanders were called together at Naizennokami's camp and given the following instructions: "Recently, Izunokami and Saemon are coming down from Edo. Last night I received reliable information about this. If these men arrive and quickly capture this castle with a large army, it will be a great disgrace for all of us. Until now, we have tried to devise methods to suppress the rebels while avoiding casualties and deaths among our allies, and we have conducted ourselves with this approach in mind.

However, I believe such methods are no longer sufficient. Tomorrow is New Year's Day, and the enemies will surely think that we would not attack on such a festive day, so we will strike while they are off guard and launch our assault from before dawn. I ask each of you to commit wholeheartedly and fight with single-minded determination starting tomorrow, New Year's Day." When this was said, everyone humbly accepted, saying "Indeed, this is a most reasonable decision." The vanguard of the pursuit force was Arima Hyōbu-Taiyu, and the other attacking forces were Matsukura, Nabeshima, Tachibana, and others. Since the Arima forces served as the vanguard in the previous castle assault, they were again assigned to lead today. However, somehow the enemy learned of the plan for another general assault tomorrow, New Year's Day, and this information leaked to the enemy side on this New Year's Eve night.

During this time, no messengers from Takumi or others should approach with even a single attendant. Everyone understood this well.
However, all of Nagato-no-kami's men died in battle, and after that, Naizennosho-sama ordered that each man should storm the castle. Everyone was awed and no one approached. When he advanced about thirty ken from the Sannomaru entrance at the bamboo fence area, he died in battle on the spot. His body was carried through on a stretcher. Miura Ichinosuke carried his armor and accompanied the procession.

It also states that after Naizennosho-sama's death in battle, Arima Genbanno-kami-sama's forces with silver helmets and half-moon insignia suffered a great defeat over an area of about two towns, which was witnessed.

It also states that those who remained at the stronghold (Hara Castle) gradually arrived after Naizennosho-sama's death in battle. One or two people came to where Takumi was stationed, and as more gradually arrived, Matsukura Nagato-no-kami's forces suffered a great rout and fled toward where the Hirado forces were positioned. The Hirado forces were pushed forward first and entered the rice fields, with some complaining. At their retreat position, food was brought from ships in buckets, and someone ate. When all forces retreated, they withdrew to Ichinosuke's hut, and next to Naizennosho-sama's camp position, Takumi and others gradually set up huts and remained there. After Toda Saemon-sama gave his orders, they moved to Naizennosho-sama's former position.

From Lord Tachibana's siege position to Lord Terasawa's siege position was deep paddy fields, while Lord Kuroda's area was salt flats. The left and right sides of Lord Terasawa's assigned position were deep paddies and salt marshes, making for a wide area. Besides these, various other generals arrived one after another by ship and constructed encampments surrounding the area from Sugawa to Ōe within Arima village. However, since the Arima entrance was wide, even with the great army assembled, they remained only within Arima village without establishing positions in other districts. From Ōe and Arakawa to the border of Kuchitsu village, one-third consisted of vacant land within Arima village. From early November until early March, over 120,000 troops moved in and cut down materials for huts, tools, and firewood, yet the mountains of Arima were never exhausted.

They erected watchtowers from their assigned positions for siege operations, firing guns and incendiary arrows continuously day and night, looking down into the castle from the towers. Consequently, those in the castle hastily built earthen screens and created moats at high points along the pathways, constructing them so that movement within the castle could not be seen from outside.

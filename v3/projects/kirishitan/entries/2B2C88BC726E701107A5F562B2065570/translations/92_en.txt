To Lord Soga Mata-zaemon

Recorded in the Shimabara Chronicle

I have respectfully read your esteemed letter of the 22nd day of the last month.
The Shogun went out to the front on the 20th, and we were told that His Lordship was in excellent spirits with nothing left to be desired, which I find most auspicious.

First, the reports I submitted from the 9th to the 12th have arrived and been reviewed. Since I have been submitting daily reports thereafter, I believe they must certainly be arriving.

Second, you have ordered that naval forces be assigned to the troops of Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami and Terasawa Hyōgo-no-kami. Regarding the naval forces I did not mention the other day, I have assigned ships to Etchū-no-kami from the beginning. As for Hyōgo-no-kami's troops, since it concerns his domain, I have ordered them to remain in that area until the situation here is settled.

Third, as I reported yesterday, there is nothing unusual about this castle. Our forces appear to be increasingly exhausted. However, I continue to direct the siege operations without letting down our guard.

Fourth, since I believe that our current number of troops here is insufficient, as I reported on the first day, I have sent word to the senior retainers requesting that troops from Matsudaira Ōsumi-no-kami, Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami, and Matsudaira Uemon-no-suke be dispatched.

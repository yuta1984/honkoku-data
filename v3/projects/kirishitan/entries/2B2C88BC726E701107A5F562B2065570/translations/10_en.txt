Dainagon Yorinobu (the Kii Dainagon) also secretly conveyed that he should "come to the domain," and there were frequent cordial invitations from Todo Izuminokami as well. Wakahara Ukyo, a senior retainer of Ikeda Terumasa, also said, "If you have aspirations for advancement, I can arrange consultations," but he declined all of these in the same manner, and ultimately did not succumb to inducements of profit. While it should be improper for a person's retainer to serve under another house, such was the custom of those times. That Iki did not follow this custom was perhaps because he was naturally endowed with manly righteousness.

Twenty-ninth day, Mizunoto-i
The "Amakusa War Chronicle" states: On the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth month, according to rumors from Shimabara, since the local rebellion was gradually being revived, on the twenty-seventh day of last month in Edo, Matsudaira Izunokami Nobutsuna and Toda Samonnokami Ujitetsu were appointed as imperial envoys for the subjugation force. They departed on the twenty-ninth day of the same month, hurrying day and night, and it is said they will likely arrive and establish camp at this location the day after tomorrow. When the various camps heard this, they said it seemed likely. That same evening, a messenger from Ii Kambunokashira Naotaka came to Itakura Naizen-no-sho. This matter was reported as actually true, and a messenger from Itakura Suonokami Muneshige also arrived. This too was said to be a confidential letter to Naizen-no-sho.
The "Record of Brave Deeds" states: Word that the Senior Councilor Matsudaira Izunokami would again descend as an imperial envoy reached Arima by around the evening of the twenty-ninth day.

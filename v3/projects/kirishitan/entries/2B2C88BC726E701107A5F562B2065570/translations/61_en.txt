He spoke loudly with rude language, but then lowered his voice and politely said instead, "Lord Yasudayu, thank you for your hard work." He did not forget this complete change in demeanor before and after, as Yasudayu would often tell people. At this time, Yasudayu had brought with him one gunner and eleven servants, but casualties reached twenty men. Moreover, fierce gunfire was unleashed from within the castle, wounding not only the vanguard soldiers but also those who formed Tadasato's hatamoto guard: Kishi Toudayu, Nagaya Shichiemon, Nagaya Genemon, Shimada Kuroubei, Ibuki Jiroubei, Itamoto Taemon, Itamoto Kinemon, Itamoto Hachirouemon, Chousho Juusaburou, Kawabata Ichidayu, Itagaki Shichinosuke (later called Hikobei), Fujita Sukedayu, Hirai Saburobei, and others sustained wounds. Honjo Shinjurou died instantly. In such circumstances, Inspector Ishitani Juuzou rushed to the hatamoto forces and said, "Bringing the hatamoto forces this far shows truly unparalleled resolve. However, this place is within arrow range. Let some of you return to camp and come back with bamboo shields." But no one responded. Then Juuzou again addressed Honjo Hachidayu: "Since you are all young men, it is reasonable that you would prefer to retreat for a while. However, it would be quite unseemly if Lord Hyoubu-Taiyu were to fail in achieving military success. While you consider your response, let us old men serve dutifully in our roles and return to the siege position.

A man named Sariemon became the leader and tried to surround our house and burn it down, but we escaped the danger by making various apologies. Also on the same 28th day, the local people, like the aforementioned person, again pressed forward and took hostages - what a troublesome situation this has been.

Item: Regarding the folding screens that have been completed - we had placed them all in our storehouse, but they became very angry and made scratch marks on them before taking them away, so you should be able to retrieve them through investigation.

Item: The numerous painting pigments are placed in jars and buried in the mountain...

Item: The folding screens requested by Taga Monto-dono have also been imported from China and placed in the right storehouse. Those requested by Yokoyama Seizaemon-dono are the same. The numerous screen foundations that are stored are well-prepared and placed in the same manner.

Item: Picture scrolls and incense burner boxes from China belonging to the temple have been buried in the mountain with stones placed as markers. Due to this strange turn of events, we have long been troubled. As for us, since two people have been taken as hostages, please understand what is in our hearts. If you are staying at Dembei's place, please make appropriate arrangements.

As recorded in the Chronicle of the Christian Uprising:

I respectfully write to you. We have copied the letters from the person that Oribe-sho has stationed in Shimabara, as well as the military strategy documents written by Naizen-dono and Jūzō-dono. As we are submitting a letter box to the council of elders (otoshiyori) to report this to Edo, could you please dispatch it? We are sending copies of these two documents to you. Please also convey this to Suō-dono, Shinano-dono, and Tōtōmi-dono. Respectfully and humbly.

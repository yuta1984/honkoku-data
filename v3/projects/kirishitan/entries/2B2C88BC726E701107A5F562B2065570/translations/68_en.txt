In addition to these, 163 direct retainer ashigaru and lower ranks, 71 of the seven divisions of the household, and 560 lower-ranking members of the household were wounded. On this day, approximately 970 people were killed or wounded by arrows and stones at the main gate under the hatamoto forces. Afterward, Tadasato consulted with Arima Naiki and selected sons, younger brothers, or other replacements for the various officials who had died or been wounded. However, many of those who had been wounded served diligently in this campaign after their injuries had completely healed. Due to the heavy casualties, when they tried to retrieve the corpses of those killed in battle by sending ashigaru and lower-ranking soldiers to the base of the castle walls under cover of night, torches were thrown out from within the castle, and muskets were fired by that light, wounding some of the men.

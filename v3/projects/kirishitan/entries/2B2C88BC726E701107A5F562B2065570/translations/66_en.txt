The inspectors (metsuke) dispatched soldiers to various units, and since Itakura Naizen's wounds were severe, and both Ishitani Jūzō and Matsudaira Jinzaburō, who had withdrawn earlier, were also wounded, it was decided that the forces at Kamie should quickly lift the siege. Tadashige also said, "In that case, let us advance our forces after the other troops have retreated," and delayed for a while. During this time, the military forces of other domains withdrew, so Tadashige organized his formation and entered the camp. When they surrounded the castle this morning, the Kurume forces attacked together with the signal rockets (ishihi-ya), but the military forces of other domains were somewhat delayed. Consequently, when the enemy tried to rescue that urgent position, our allied vanguard forces, not to mention the forces from both sides of the Sannomaru's detached fortifications, fired their muskets severely.

For this reason, our domain's casualties were double those of other domains. Considering this, although the order for the castle attack was urgent, it seems that Tadashige's unit had the honor of being the vanguard on this day. Afterward, Tadashige summoned Honjō Hachidayū and said, "To report today's situation to Lord Toyouji, Tajiri Jirō'emon will go up to Edo tomorrow. Examine the wounded and dead and prepare a written report." Immediately, Hachidayū gathered all the unit commanders and recorded the names of those who were killed or wounded:
　Unit Commander: Murakami Shirō'emon　　Head of Musket Unit: Nioe Sazaemon
　Warrior Commander: Miura Sōzaemon　　　Same rank: Naka Zentarō
　《Son of Jinnosuke》Rikuta Jūsuke　　　Promotion Officer: Matsuda Sakubē

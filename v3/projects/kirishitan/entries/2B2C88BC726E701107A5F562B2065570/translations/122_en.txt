They formed units, crossed to Shimabara, floated their ships near the castle, and fired stone fire arrows. However, because the castle was high, they could not hit their intended targets from the ships, so their efforts were in vain, and they quickly returned to Hirado. The interpreters from Hirado were Sadakata Riuemon and Ishibashi Shōsuke.

What is commonly told among people is that a Dutch sailor climbed the mast to observe inside the castle, where there were riflemen in the castle who shot him down. This is indeed a false story. The saying "when one dog barks, ten thousand dogs join in chorus" refers to such matters.

According to what an interpreter who sailed with the Dutch ship when it departed from Hirado related: Five or six Dutch men were called to land to fire stone fire arrows, but the gun barrel was narrow and one person was hit by it and died. Since I was accompanying them and witnessed this myself, what doubt could there be? On the ship, one Japanese person who had brought the Dutch was hit by a rifle shot and lost his finger.

Also recorded: Four Chinese ships were sent to Hara Castle, and the cost for this was 33 kan and 990 me of silver.

According to the "Shimabara Record": Around mid-January, from both forces of Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami and Kuroda Uemon-no-suke, fifty guard ships were deployed at sea and fired cannons. The castle defenders found this troublesome and came out from the various encampments in the direction from which the cannons were coming to defend against the walls and projectiles.

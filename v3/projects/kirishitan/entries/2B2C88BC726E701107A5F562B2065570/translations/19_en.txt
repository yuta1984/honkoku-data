The instructions given were as follows: "On New Year's Day we shall launch a general assault and capture the castle. From the night of New Year's Eve, approach stealthily to the base of the walls, place bamboo bundles, and wait for dawn. When the night begins to brighten, the commanding general Naizen-no-shō will display two lanterns on the artificial hill at Matsukura's camp as a signal. When those lanterns appear, fire all the stone-fire arrows. When the combined forces hear the sound of the stone-fire arrows, they shall all charge into the castle at once with a great shout." These signals have now been determined.

From the Amakusa War Chronicle, a copy of the written orders from Matsukura Nagato-no-kami's senior retainer:
1. Both sides shall advance their firearms first, firing as appropriate, then charge afterward.
1. Lord Itakura Mondo and Lord Ukon shall follow behind and then engage. Earlier, Lord Ukon gave firm orders to Shinbei. All the inner retainers should understand this arrangement.
1. Shields and such should be carried and used effectively in the vanguard.
   However, I wonder if other household units are also carrying shields.
1. As ordered to Sakuzaemon earlier, this is to be a fight to the death—this has been clearly communicated to all.
1. Approach the base of the walls carrying bamboo bundles.
1. Regarding blowing conch shells: fire muskets according to the conch signal.

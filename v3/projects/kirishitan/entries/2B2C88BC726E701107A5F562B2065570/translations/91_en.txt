To Lord Itakura Suō-no-kami

Furthermore, Lord Izu-no-kami and Lord Samon have not yet arrived here. We are eagerly awaiting these two gentlemen. Regarding the situation here, although Lord Naizen was killed in battle, nothing can be said to be settled. I too am exerting myself considerably. Not a single remaining rebel has been driven down to our side, which is not an urgent matter.

Recorded in the Christian Uprising Memorandum

This should be written on separate paper, but due to urgency, I write it thus. Please send this letter to Edo with all haste. Oribe-no-shō states that if Naizen falls ill, Oribe should come, as instructed in the official letter received earlier. Accordingly, I will soon depart from here and go to Shimabara. When Kawakatsu Tanba, Sassa Gonbee, and Oribe go to that area, they should be in Funai, as stated in a similar official letter, so both men will be dispatched to Funai. With fear and reverence.

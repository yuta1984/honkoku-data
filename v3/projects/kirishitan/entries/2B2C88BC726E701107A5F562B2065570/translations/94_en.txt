However, in the end there was no one who advanced even thirty ken (to the base of the wall). During this time, Naizen-no-shō was already killed in action, and Jūzō was severely struck by stones in the same place and was also wounded by gunfire. For this reason, those inside first withdrew. We two were inside when Matsukura Nagato-no-kami provided rear support, but when Matsukura's front-line troops were beaten back and began to collapse one after another, we forcibly pushed them forward from behind. We sent messengers to Matsukura's position five or six times telling them to provide rear support, but they increasingly fled in disorder. When we two went forward, the foot soldiers and others pressed close against the wall together with the front troops, and there were some casualties and deaths. We appointed supervision of our battle standards.

Katō Genzaemon was also killed in action. All of Arima Genba's forces fled in disorder as well, but we two, down to our servants, did not retreat even one step. Though the situation was such, the castle threw stones fiercely and fired many guns, so it was impossible to capture it with such small forces. We considered our options, but since there were no forces continuing as one unit, we had no choice but to withdraw about thirty ken from the wall and remain there. Eventually all the forces also withdrew, so Jūzō sent word through a messenger that we should withdraw, and so we first withdrew to the temporary shelter. Given these circumstances, the place where Naizen was killed in action was different, and moreover, we could barely manage to retrieve those who had died in battle - it is deeply regrettable.

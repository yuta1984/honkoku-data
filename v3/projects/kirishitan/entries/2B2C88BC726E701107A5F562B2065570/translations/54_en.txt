From the castle they threw out torches and fired guns intensively. The enemies on top of the walls held their spears in reverse grip and stabbed to death many of those who had reached the walls. Seeing this defeat, Lord Itakura Naizen-no-shō observed this and dismounted from his horse to try to stop it, but since messengers from various provinces competed to charge forward first, Lord Tachibana's forces suffered losses in their attack and were also subjected to arrow fire. Matsuura Ukon sat on a camp stool without saying much of anything, while Okamoto Shinbei thrust his spear upward and declared, "This is Matsuura's assigned sector, and others should not interfere." Lord Tachibana had held some resentment toward the neighboring provinces for years, so both sides behaved in this manner.

According to the "Arima-fu" (Arima Chronicle): On New Year's Day, the imperial envoys Itakura Naizen-no-shō and Ishitani Jūkura attacked the castle. Toyoshi (Arima Naotoyo) besieged the third bailey. Tadasato (Tachibana Tadashige) led his troops before dawn to reach the base of the walls and deployed his soldiers within the moat. His retainer Matsuda Sakubei and many others were killed in action.

December 27th, from Hineno Oribenojo
To Lord Abe Bitchu-no-kami
Lord Inagaki Settsu-no-kami  
Lord Hugai Inaba-no-kami
Lord Soga Matazaemon
All gentlemen

Additional record:

I sent a letter yesterday on the 26th, which should have arrived by now.

First, today again I received a report from the personnel that Oribe has stationed at Shimabara. As reported yesterday, there are no significant changes. Lord Hosokawa Echizen-no-kami has deployed about twenty ships for the siege and is having cannons fired at the main keep from the naval forces.

First, regarding the Shimabara situation on the 20th, reports came from Makino Denzo, Hayashi Tamba, and Arima Kuranoske (retainer of Arima Genba). These reports also contain the same information as mentioned above. I have heard rumors that people are discussing how they could storm the castle if all forces coordinated their attacks. This is indeed a regrettable situation.

First, Matsudaira Jinzaburo sent word to us that provisions appear to be in short supply in that area, and the besieging forces seem to be in distress. Apart from the above, I have not heard of any other significant developments. Please send this letter in a box to Edo.

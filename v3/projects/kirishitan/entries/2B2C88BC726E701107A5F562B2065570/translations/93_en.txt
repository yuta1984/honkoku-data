First, I have just received word that Matsudaira Izu-no-kami and Toda Saemon arrived this morning at a place called Harada in Chikuzen Province. I believe they will arrive at this location today or tomorrow. Once these two arrive, I will consult with them on all matters. I will report again later. With fear and respect.

Third day of the first month　　　　　　Ishigaya Jūzō Sadakiyo
To Lord Itakura Suō-no-kami

Furthermore, please do not worry about Lord Monto. Until this place is settled, I alone will remain here. I have put Shinbei and Tōemon in charge of all matters. Please do not be concerned. My hand injury is very light, but while inspecting the front lines, I was again struck hard by a stone. This also causes pain and trouble to my body, but since I am walking about, please do not worry.

Another entry:

As I reported in my previous letter, when we launched a general assault on this castle, none of the various forces advanced at all. Though we two tried various forms of encouragement and shouting, and ordered them to press forward from behind, there were none who would attack. In that case, we two would take the lead and give orders, so I went out to Arima Genba's attack position and ordered them to attack quickly. Though there were some who spoke sporadically, they would not attack. Since we two could no longer bear to watch, we pressed close against the wall ourselves and said "Come, I will lead the charge, so attack!"

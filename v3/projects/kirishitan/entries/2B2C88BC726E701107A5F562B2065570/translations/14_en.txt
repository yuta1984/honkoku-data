In any case, there was no choice but to prepare for New Year's Day at that late hour. Afterward, I went to the senior officials and said, "I have been informed in detail, as you told the chief retainers when you summoned them, that tomorrow we will be ordered to attack the castle. In that case, my assigned position is at the main gate of the beach approach. When we attacked on the 20th the other day, I heard that many enemies had positioned their defenses at the main gate. Our men say they saw this clearly with their own eyes. You can hear directly from those men as well." "Even if we attack the castle tomorrow, we will only be focused on climbing over the walls, and we won't be able to spare attention for guarding the flanks. If (the enemy) makes a sortie, our men who are clinging to the walls won't be able to defend against the enemy.

In that case, I would be troubled if you thought I was being negligent. If I try to defend the flanks, I will fall behind in the castle assault. What would be the best course of action?" When I asked this, Lord Naizen, Lord Jūzō, Lord Hida, and Lord Saburōzaemon said, "We find your concerns entirely reasonable. This is a matter of great importance. If the enemy makes a sortie while all our forces are pushing up against the castle in fierce combat, our entire army will be defeated. If that happens, it will be a disgrace to the realm. Therefore, we will set aside all other matters and wait at the beach approach for the enemy to sally forth. If (our forces) climb into (the castle), the enemy probably won't come out. Even after our forces enter, if the enemy still doesn't emerge, we will push in through the main gate of the beach approach."

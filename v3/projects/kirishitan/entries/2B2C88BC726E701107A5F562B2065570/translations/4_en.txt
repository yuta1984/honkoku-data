Record of the Christian Uprising

I respectfully write to you. A messenger has arrived from our personnel stationed at Arima, so I am sending a letter of report to Edo in the document box of the inspectors (metsuke).

First, there are no particular incidents in that area, but since the siege engineers have not arrived, the imperial envoys are said to be troubled. Next, regarding the time when the attack was launched on the morning of the 20th, there are rumors among the lower ranks saying that if all forces had competed in the assault, they could have captured the fortress.

First, provisions are expensive and in short supply, and the various forces appear to be in difficult circumstances.

First, although fire arrows are deployed daily, the defenders in the castle diligently extinguish them, so ultimately they cannot set it ablaze.

First, Lord Hosokawa Echizen has arrived with about twenty ships for the siege, and cannons are fired from the ships daily. This seems to inflict some damage, and when the cannons are fired, the people in the castle are said to become agitated. The muskets fired from the mountainside mostly overshoot and do not hit the castle's defenses.

First, there are no incidents in Tsumori or neighboring provinces. As stated above, I humbly request that this message be conveyed to Lords Suou and Shinano for transmission to Edo.

With fear and respectful words

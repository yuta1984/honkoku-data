"by this." Tadasato gave an appropriate response, and from this point forward, they spoke to each other without reserve. Also, Ichikawa Jinuemon and Yamanaka Sakuemon, retainers of Kishu who had been assigned as attendants to the shogunal envoy, sent urgent messengers to report to their lord Yorikane-kyō about how the various generals had exerted themselves with utmost dedication during the New Year's Day castle attack. His lordship's response was that "though still young in years, he particularly studies military arts and understands the relative importance of military achievements." When Ichikawa presented the written report for his perusal, it was determined that "regarding the dedicated efforts from beginning to end at this front, this was an unparalleled achievement." After this, the Dainagon showed his sincere appreciation toward Tadasato.

It is also said that since the New Year's Day castle attack was unsuccessful and all forces completely withdrew, Lord Ishitani Jūzō and Lord Matsudaira Jinzaburō sent urgent messengers to Lord Hosokawa Higo-no-kami, ordering: "The forces at this front are insufficient. You should lead military forces and join the campaign within a day or two."

The Hosokawa Family Shimabara Military Record states: "Regarding the New Year's Day castle attack, there were wounded and dead among the Kumamoto forces at this time as well. The shogunal envoys ordered Lord Mitsutoshi that Kumamoto forces should be dispatched to Shimabara immediately."

The memorandum of Tachibana Sakon-shōgen Tadashige states: "The New Year's Day castle attack involved only brief skirmishes, and as soon as they pressed forward, they immediately withdrew. Arima Gemba's forces withdrew during the night."

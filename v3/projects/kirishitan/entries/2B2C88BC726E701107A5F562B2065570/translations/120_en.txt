10th Day, Kinoe-Inu (Wood-Dog)

According to "Lord Matsudaira Kainokami Teritsuna's Amakusa Diary": On the 10th, although they equipped iron cannons from the sea to attack the rebel castle, the ships were small and the castle was high, so it was not very effective. Therefore, they searched for a large ship, and fortunately there was a Dutch large ship at Hirado. They immediately ordered the Dutch to row and send that ship toward the rebel castle to fire stone fire arrows.

According to "Nishimura Gohei's Memorandum": On the day when the Dutch ship was summoned from Hirado and arrived, many people could be seen coming and going at the valley entrance between the main bailey and the second bailey, so stone fire arrows were fired from the seven-chō watchtower.

When they fired into the center, there was extraordinary commotion. At that time, three small firearms were fired from behind pine trees and the like outside the main bailey's fence. Two shots hit the Dutch ship, and one shot hit the right shoulder of Horie Zenbei's white haori jacket, and struck the little finger of a man named Hayashi Izaemon who was at Haruzato-chō, making it black about the size of a bean. Everyone said that if they had fired many shots, the ship would never have been able to approach.

Also recorded: Miyazaki Chūbei went aboard the Dutch ship as a supervisor.

Also recorded: In mid-January, Kamefuchi Magozaemon and Jō Jūrōzaemon came regarding the stone fire arrows.

Also recorded: Around the same time, Akashi Sakudayū and Fujita Kazaemon came as messengers.

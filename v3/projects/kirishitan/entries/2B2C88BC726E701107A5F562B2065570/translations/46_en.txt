at that hour (around 2 PM), everyone withdrew without exception.

The *Bansei Kafu* (Genealogy of Ten Thousand Generations) states regarding [Ishigaya] Jūzō: At dawn on New Year's Day, various forces pressed forward, and muskets and spears were fired from the castle, causing numerous wounded and dead among all forces, who then retreated. Naizen-no-shō and Jūzō intended to scale and enter over the walls, but the musket fire was intense, stones were thrown, both men's spears were broken, Naizen-no-shō was hit by a musket ball and died in battle. Jūzō was also hit by musket fire and struck by stones, his armor was damaged, and his identification banner had no strong parts left and was completely torn. Lord Itakura Mizu-no-suke's father died in battle, many of his retainers also died in battle, and there were many wounded.

That night, thinking there might be a night attack from within the castle, Jūzō, despite his wounds, made four rounds of the various encampments. After returning to Edo, Jūzō's armor and identification banner were presented for imperial inspection.

It also states: Since there were numerous dead and wounded among all forces on New Year's Day, word was sent via mounted messenger that reinforcements should be quickly dispatched to Lords Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami, Matsudaira Uemon-no-suke, and Matsudaira Ōsumi-no-kami.

The *Heika Chawa* (Military Tea Talk) states: Ishigaya Jūzō served as an inspector (*ometsuke*) and fought on the battlefield during the Shimabara Rebellion. On New Year's Day, when Itakura Naizen-no-shō died in battle, his son Shuzen appealed to Jūzō: "This morning when Naizen-no-shō died in battle, I should have died alongside him, but I did not encounter the enemy..."

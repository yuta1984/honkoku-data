Seeing this, Tadamura ordered "Sound the conch shell!" However, for some reason, the conch shell blower was unable to blow the shell properly. Tadamura became extremely displeased. Meanwhile, when Tadamura saw the vanguard's military banner fluttering below the castle walls, he dispatched Nasu Hachibe as a messenger to the on-duty inspectors - Matsudaira Jinzaburo, Hayashi Tamba-no-kami, and Makino Denzo - with the message "Please observe that our banner has reached below the walls." When Hachibe rushed back to the rear formation and delivered this message to Matsudaira Jinzaburo, the reply came: "Without needing to be told, all three of us have clearly witnessed it, and it is most admirable."

The banner officer Matsuda Sakube threw the military banner into the castle and was about to climb in himself when the castle defenders threw the banner back out. Tadamura remarked that "Matsuda is originally a brave man." Although Matsuda threw the banner in twice, he was finally struck by gunfire and fell. A page named Rinzo rushed to help Matsuda up, but was also shot through, and master and servant lay side by side.

Komada Yazaemon and Kato Densuke, a retainer of Arima Naiki, charged into the castle, finally striking down two enemies, stripped their armor, leaving only their undergarments, and threw the corpses outside the castle. Horie Ichiroubei (later known as Mokuemon) climbed onto the walls but was knocked down and wounded. In this situation, Arima Naiki, the same Kenbutsu, Yoshida Hayato, Inatsugi Nabenosuke, Tsuchida Shuden, and others tried to encourage their forces.

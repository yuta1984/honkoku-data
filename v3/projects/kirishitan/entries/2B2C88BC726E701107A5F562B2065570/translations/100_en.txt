According to the memorandum of Nishimura Gohei: Having received orders from Toda Saemon-sama, I accompanied Saemon-sama in this matter:
The identification banners for the household guard were made of torn white silk with three-star crests. Exposed to wind and rain in cramped quarters day and night, they turned mouse-gray, and the three stars became blurred, appearing extremely unsightly. Therefore, I reported this to a certain Takumi and requested replacement, after which new ones were properly made to satisfaction.

According to the red annotations in the "Yaso Seibatsu-ki" (Record of Christian Suppression): On the morning of the 4th day of the 1st month, both generals advanced toward Hara Castle. The rebels had long plotted to spy on the generals' arrival through informants and launch a night attack, making preparations accordingly. However, both generals perceived this well and arrived in the morning instead. This was due to their martial valor. Itakura Shigemasa's retainers had arrived by ship the previous day. Nobitsuna arrived at the Hara campaign headquarters on horseback from Shimabara, accompanied only by his retainers Matsui Shume, Fujinuma Hikozaemon, and Ido Chusaburo.

According to the "Amakusa Gunki" (Amakusa Military Record):

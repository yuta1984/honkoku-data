Last year on this day, I tied the strings of my court cap at Edo Castle, and this year on this day, I tie the strings of my armor at Shimabara - such is my departure for battle. Though this is the way of our impermanent world, I am deeply moved by this moment.

At the beginning of the new year, like scattered blossoms,
I shall leave only my name behind as I charge ahead as the vanguard.

New Year's Day　　　　　Itakura Naizen-no-sho
To Lord Ishigaya Jūzō

There was another letter with no addressee.

Naizen-no-sho's remains were cremated at Tōji Temple in Shimabara. His retainers Murata Yahyōe and Itō Han-no-jō escorted the remains to Kyoto and reported to Itakura Suō-no-kami, after which he was finally reburied at Chōen-ji Temple in Mikawa Province. His posthumous Buddhist name was Teigetsuin-den Zen-shōjiki-hōgyo Kenrei Genkō Daiko-ji.

It is also said that on New Year's Day in Edo, a great wind blew fiercely from the west, continuing from morning until dawn without cease, making everything pitch black in all directions so that the colors of things could not be distinguished. The various daimyo and hatamoto who came to pay their New Year's respects each ascended to the castle, but there was great commotion within the castle. In the castle's reception rooms, all the rain shutters and sliding doors were put up, so many candles had to be lit, making it like night even in broad daylight, and everyone performed their formal audience. At that time, malicious gossips whispered among themselves that the ceremony resembled funeral rites, speaking inauspiciously.

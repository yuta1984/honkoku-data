and bring bamboo shields." Accordingly, Hachidayu said "I understand" and drew his sword, leaving it at that spot, then brought many bamboo shields from the siege position to surround the hatamoto forces. That Hachidayu left his back banner there was according to the ancient custom when temporarily returning to the rear position. Afterwards, Juuzou headed toward the third bailey, but before long a messenger came from the inspector. Chousho Kanbei confronted the messenger and heard his message: "Command the vanguard forces and attack the castle." Kanbei said to the messenger, "Lord Hyoubu-Taiyu's men have been working at the base of the walls since before dawn this morning, sparing no effort for life and limb. To now say 'attack the castle' is a strange new

order. Such an ill-considered command cannot be lightly reported to my master. Convey this message." He then sent the messenger back. When night came, the inspector (believed to be the one who had sent that messenger) withdrew his hut, and Tadasato's hatamoto soldiers all laughed in unison, saying "The inspector's defeat is unseemly." Tadasato imposed restraint on them. Meanwhile, it was heard that Lord Itakura Naizen sustained deep wounds at Lord Matsukura's siege position, and Lord Ishitani Juuzou and Lord Matsudaira Jinzaburou were also wounded and withdrawn to their huts. The attacking forces lost heart and showed signs of retreat, while the castle defenders rode their momentum to victory, frequently launching arrows and stones and raising war cries, causing all the various forces to collapse and withdraw.

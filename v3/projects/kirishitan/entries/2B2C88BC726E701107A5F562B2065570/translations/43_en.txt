Sand and stones flew up striking faces, making it impossible to open one's eyes. In yesterday's council of war, they determined that the time limit for the castle assault would be the first point of the hour of the Dragon. Here, Arima Hyōbu-Taifu Tadayori (later changed to Nakatsukasa) was designated as the vanguard. Perhaps thinking to assault this castle during the night and claim sole glory for himself, without waiting for the signal and past the appointed time, he deployed several thousand troops and pressed forward to the moat edge of the main approach to the third bailey, raising battle cries. Although the various generals of the besieging force heard these battle cries, since the timing was wrong, they never suspected it was Arima's forces. In the darkness, thinking that the enemy had learned of this morning's castle attack and was making battle cries as a stratagem to confuse the timing of the signal, the entire army did not join in the battle cries and remained quiet without making a sound. At the third bailey were 3,500 men from Ōe, Futsu village, Dōzaki, and Kita-Arima, none of whom showed any sign of disturbance.

Then from the turrets, earthwork loopholes, and within the moats, muskets fired out like rain. In a short time, Arima's forces suffered 1,000 wounded and dead, and because of this could not cross the moat, becoming a defeated army from the middle of the hour of the Tiger. The castle defenders, riding high on their momentum, opened the castle gates and pursued them. They fled all the way to Kurume and returned to their main camp. When the various generals of the besieging force saw this, the signal coordination had already fallen into chaos. Although the vanguard of one wing of the besieging force was defeated and withdrew, since the signal was predetermined, all forces pressed forward together at the hour of the Dragon.

The Arima Records state: "On New Year's Day, from dawn in Edo the northwest wind blew so fiercely as to break trees, making it like a dark night, and in addition there was heavy rain."

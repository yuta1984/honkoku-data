This knowing is the ordinary way of things. Now, there was a time of void silence when there was no heaven, no earth, and not a single thing existed. But when this heaven and earth appeared, with the sun, moon, and stars in heaven releasing their light, shining clearly and never failing in their times of rising in the east and setting in the west, and with thousands of grasses and myriad trees on earth that never err in their seasons of blooming flowers and falling leaves—this could not exist without a Creator. This Creator is called Deus (God), they say.

Breaking this down, I say: What rare thing is this? In which of the various schools is this principle not discussed? "There is that which precedes heaven and earth, formless and originally silent, capable of being the master of all phenomena," it is also said, and "Following the four seasons, it does not wither." What does Heaven say? "The four seasons proceed, and the hundred things are born"—this too exists. Besides this, in Buddhism this principle is discussed through the sequence of formation, duration, destruction, and emptiness; in Shinto, the divine ages are divided into seven generations of heavenly deities and five generations of earthly deities.

is the path by which [God] fulfills the desires we present to Deus.

Disciple: Where does Deus reside?

Master: He resides everywhere in heaven and earth.

Disciple: When we recite the "Pater Noster," by which words do we convey our thoughts to Deus?

Master: By the words of the first verse: "Our Father who art in heaven."

Disciple: Why do we say "Father" rather than "Lord"?

Master: By calling Him "Father," we remember that He cherishes us, and we can petition Him with an affectionate heart.

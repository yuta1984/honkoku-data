Disciple: If someone either pours water without reciting these words, or says only half the words, or omits even one word while pouring water, or recites all the words while pouring water but recites the aforementioned text either before or after pouring the water rather than simultaneously - what should be done in such cases?

Master: If one does not recite the words while simultaneously pouring the water, then baptism has not been received. Also, it is essential to recite the text completely. However, even if the words "I" or "Amen" are omitted, or if the name of the person receiving baptism is not mentioned, it still constitutes baptism. But if any other word besides these three is omitted, then baptism has not been properly administered.

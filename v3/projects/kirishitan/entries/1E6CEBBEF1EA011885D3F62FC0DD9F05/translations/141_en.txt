Disciple: What are the circumstances that would make fasting harmful to one's health?

Master: Such circumstances are many. First, when one lacks sufficient morning nourishment such that fasting would cause one to lose strength, not observing the fast does not constitute breaking the commandments. Second, when one engages in mentally taxing work, suffers from illness, lacks physical strength, is pregnant, is a woman nursing an infant, or when experience suggests that fasting would be harmful to one's body, it is not problematic to refrain from fasting. Because there are many such circumstances, one should consult with one's confessor.

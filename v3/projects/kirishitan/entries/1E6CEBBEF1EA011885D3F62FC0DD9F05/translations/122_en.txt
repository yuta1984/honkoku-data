Even when there are circumstances, the commandment is that one must not kill those who are not even one's own retainers.

Disciple: What does it mean to not wish evil deeds upon others?

Master: To harbor anger toward the body, to wish to do harm, or to break relationships and cease speaking with others - these acts transgress against this commandment.

Disciple: How should one observe the sixth commandment?

Master: One must not commit the sin of lechery with anyone through words or actions. To commit such acts upon oneself is also the same sin.

Disciple: Why do you say "through words or actions"? Would desiring this in one's heart also constitute the same sin?

Concerning the Commandments [of the Church]

Disciple: You have already revealed the commandments of Deus (God). Now, what are the commandments of Santa Egreja (Holy Church)?

Master: The commandments of Egreja (the Church) are many. Among them, there are commandments that apply to the entire Church through certain precepts. These are namely the commandments established by the Comsiriyo [Consistory] or by the Papa (Pope) who serves as the representative of our Lord Jesu Christo (Jesus Christ) throughout the world. These are commandments that all Christãos (Christians) must observe without fail. Additionally, there are commandments established according to particular places, and these are determined by the local Bispo (Bishop).

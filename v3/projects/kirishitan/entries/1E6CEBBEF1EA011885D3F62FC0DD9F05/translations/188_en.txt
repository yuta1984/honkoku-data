○ Prayer of Confession
Beginning with God who fulfills all things, and to the ever-Virgin Saint Mary, Saint Michael the Archangel, Saint John the Baptist, the noble apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul, all the saints, and to you, I confess my sins. Through thought, word, and deed I have committed many sins - it is my fault, it is my fault, it is my most grievous fault. Therefore I beseech the ever-Virgin Saint Mary, Saint Michael the Archangel, Saint John the Baptist, the noble apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul, all the saints, and you to pray for me to our Lord God.

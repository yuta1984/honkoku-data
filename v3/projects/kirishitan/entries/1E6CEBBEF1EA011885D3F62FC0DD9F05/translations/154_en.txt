sins, repent and grieve for them, and from then on be resolved to keep and observe the commandments of our Lord Jesus Christ - it is essential to receive this sacrament with such preparation.

Disciple: How is this sacrament administered?

Master: Water should be poured on the head of the person receiving it, or at least on some part of their body, while reciting these words: "Whether the name be Peter, Paul, or whatever name is given, I, [name], God washes you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen." When reciting this in Latin scripture, after giving whatever name, one says: "Ego te baptizo in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen."

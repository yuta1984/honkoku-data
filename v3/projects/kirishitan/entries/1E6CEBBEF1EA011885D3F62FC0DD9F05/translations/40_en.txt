Disciple: Having received this teaching, I wish to partake in your instruction.

Master: That is exactly what we desire. ○First, do you understand what kind of person's work it is to become a Christian?

Disciple: One becomes a Christian through the grace of Deus.

Master: What does it mean "through the grace of Deus"?

Disciple: I do not understand this matter in detail. Please, I beg you to teach me.

Master: "Through the grace of Deus" means that it is not by the power of oneself or one's parents' creation (human effort), but solely through Deus's ☩ divine will and mercy, and also through the merit and power of our Lord Jesus Christ that one becomes a Christian.

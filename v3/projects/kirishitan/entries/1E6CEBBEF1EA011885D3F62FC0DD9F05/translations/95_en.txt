Disciple: What is the meaning of the second artigo (article) "and in His only Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, I believe"?

Master: Our Lord Jesus Christ is Deus (God). The reason is that Deus, as the same true essence, wisdom, and spirit as the Atere (Father), is the true only Son who never changes in any aspect.

Disciple: In what manner does Deus beget His Son? Could it be through the way of yin-yang union?

Master: When we hear that Deus begets His Son, we must not think of it basely like human affairs. This is because He possesses a spiritual body that transcends physical form - a pure and sacred body.

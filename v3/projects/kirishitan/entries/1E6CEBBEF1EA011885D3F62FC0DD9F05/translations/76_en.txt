Master: We direct it to the noble Domina Virgen Maria.

Disciple: What do we ask of her? Do we perhaps ask for the forgiveness of our sins?

Master: It is not such a matter.

Disciple: Do we ask for grasa (grace) and gloria (glory)?

Master: It is not such a matter either.

Disciple: Then to whom do we ask for these things?

Master: We ask the Lord Deus.

Disciple: What do we ask of the Mother?

Master: In order to seek these things, we ask for her intercession before the Lord Jesu Cristo, who is her Son.

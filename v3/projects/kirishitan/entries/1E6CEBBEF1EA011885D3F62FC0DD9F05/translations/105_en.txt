through His mortal remains He rose again, and now appears with the glory as He sits in Heaven - this too is revealed in this Article.

Disciple: What does the sixth Article mean: "He ascended into Heaven and sits at the right hand of Deus Patre (God the Father) who is almighty"?

Master: After Our Lord Jesus Christ rose again, He ascended to Heaven together with His human body, and so Lord Deus (God) grants Him an even greater glory than that of all the Beatos (Saints) combined.

Disciple: Why do we say He sits at the right hand? Does Deus (God) have right and left sides?

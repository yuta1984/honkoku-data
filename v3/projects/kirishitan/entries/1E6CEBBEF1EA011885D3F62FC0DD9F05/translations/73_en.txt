This is the prayer that was composed in this manner.

Disciple: Who is the Holy Mother (Birzen)?

Master: She is one chosen to be the Mother of God, placed above all the angels in heaven, and is a Queen filled with all virtues. Through this, she is superior to all other prayers and is in perfect accordance with the inner will [of God] before her Son Jesus Christ. Because she reasonably grants what we petition, each Christian deeply believes in and reveres her.

Disciple: For what reason do we offer prayers to Holy Mother Santa Maria one hundred fifty times or sixty-three times?

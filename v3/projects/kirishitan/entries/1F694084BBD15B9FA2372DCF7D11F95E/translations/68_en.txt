About three chō ahead, they could see four or five pine trees through the gaps at the base of a round hill called Bokaku-no-o, with what looked like deer antler shavings attached to bamboo tips.

"Remembering your daily benevolence, I have abandoned my wife and children to join your side. The rebels have gathered at the manor house in Seno village on the border between Antoku village and Fukae, waiting for your forces. Please advance there," he said.

Dismount from horses." Shinbei wore a large ornament shaped like ox horns, while the others wore only armor without any ornaments or banners. I made a banner from cut bamboo.

According to the Shimabara Record, the Christians of Amakusa in Higo Province heard of the events at Shimabara in Hizen Province and, believing in the persuasion of Masuda Shirō Tokisada, rose up in unison starting from the 25th and 26th of the same 10th month and started a rebellion. This was also originally connected to the Shimabara rebellion through Christian fellowship, so it is heard that such events occurred because they frequently relied on and persuaded each other in various ways.

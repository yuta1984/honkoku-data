He will punish the wicked with strict examination" - these are all the words of Saint Gregory.

Now, to fully understand this truth, listen to what the scholar Scotus has written. With four principles, he shows that at the end, the obstacles become greatest, and therefore true repentance becomes difficult.

First, the great obstacle of the deathbed is that against the true repentance in which one should think of God, the agonies of death and illness come competing and surround the body to attack it. To understand this well, all mental anguish is particularly strong and has the power to immediately pull and overturn human freedom and the power of the six senses. Among these, the anguish of fear is even stronger than the anguish of joy, so at the end, when that fear becomes deep, even the vital power of the six senses cannot obtain freedom.

For example, a person suffering from heart disease forgets everything when the pain is severe. Even if one is ordinarily a good person, when afflicted with such pain, being tormented by that suffering makes it truly difficult for the vital power of the five body parts and six senses to focus solely on thinking of God at that moment. If even good people are like this, how much more so for those who have never thought of God throughout their lives and have grown accustomed to prioritizing the physical body over the soul - how could they abandon what is familiar to their body and turn toward what is unfamiliar?

Second, true repentance and penance must be accomplished through the free will of one's volition. Regarding this, Saint Thomas Aquinas

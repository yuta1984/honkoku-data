Though you possess a body that cannot be saved unless you prostrate yourself at His feet, shed tears, and beseech His mercy, why do you try to turn away from Him and provoke His anger? Listen to what Saint Bernard says to such people: "I ask you, who postpone reforming your conduct for later: Will the Lord easily forgive your sins? And if you think that whatever sins you may have, He will forgive them through His compassionate mercy, then it would be proper to quickly rely on His greatness and increasingly revere His limitless grace. Yet instead, to pile up evil deeds—what extreme wickedness would this be? And what answer could you give to this inquiry?" These are all the words of Saint Bernard. Truly, when God calls you again, the sins you have tasted now will feel more bitter than darkness, and you should think it would be better to die a thousand or ten thousand times rather than turn away from the Lord through sin. If not, you should know this means your situation is perilous.

Another thing to observe is: how foolish must be those who lose their time of physical vigor and postpone the path of abandoning evil and cultivating good until their years decline? For example, if a person going on a journey, having many horses available, chose the weakest horse first, loaded the heavy baggage on just that one horse, and led the remaining horses uselessly, who would not call this foolish? You are no different—thinking to lead many horses of time uselessly and to bear heavy burdens until your years decline is truly the height of folly. As Seneca says, those who wait until old age to undertake good works appear to devote time that is useless for their benefit to such endeavors.

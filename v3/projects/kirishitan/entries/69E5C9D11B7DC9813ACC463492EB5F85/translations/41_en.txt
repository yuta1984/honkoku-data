He grieves even more deeply over this reliance that should be placed [in Him]. David expressed this lament in Psalm 128: "Supra dorsum meum fabricauerunt peccatores" (The wicked have built evil upon my back). Who taught you to make God's mercy the foundation for your willful evil? The teaching of the Holy Spirit is completely different from this: "Just as God is good, we should desire to become good people, offering our utmost devotion above all things and following Him. No matter how great our sins, if we repent from the bottom of our hearts and return to the Lord, we will undoubtedly receive His forgiveness." However, "precisely because God is good, turning away from Him constitutes an even greater sin." Instead of praising and revering God's mercy as we should, you place vain hope in it, become His enemy, and pile sin upon sin—what manner of grave offense does this constitute?

Could it be that God would not punish such rebellion according to His divine law? This punishment does not oppose His mercy as your heart imagines, but serves only to strengthen your resolve to abandon sin. Here again there are those who, not knowing the severity of divine law, speak only of the vastness of His mercy. When one truly understands the profound gravity of this law, one should say with David: "Who can comprehend how intense and great is the Lord's wrath? And who can fully express it?"

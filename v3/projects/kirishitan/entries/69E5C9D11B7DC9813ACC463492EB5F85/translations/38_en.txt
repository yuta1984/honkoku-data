Ultimately, the certain path is this: there is no doubt that a person of proper conduct will have a proper state of mind at death. Even if there are cases where He grants special grace to certain people, do not let your heart relax completely in reliance on this. This does not apply to all people, and whether it will occur for you is something that cannot be known at all.

However, which degree will be equivalent to deep repentance is something that only the Lord God who grants that grace knows. Therefore, although the learned scholars are not ignorant that through the efficacy of Confession even shallow repentance can serve as a substitute for deep repentance, as shown above, to place hope in such repentance and postpone until the very end is an extremely dangerous course...

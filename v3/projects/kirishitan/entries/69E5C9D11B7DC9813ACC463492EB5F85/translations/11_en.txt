Preface to the Reader ✳ Volume Two

In the upper volume of this work, we discussed the various matters that compel us to recommend virtue. This demonstrates through the reasoning of God's virtues as well as the Four Last Things—death, judgment, hell, and paradise. Next, we revealed the twelve graces of virtue that God grants as reward for goodness. This too serves as the most profound and convenient means for encouraging virtue.

Now in this lower volume, we also divide it into two parts. In the first part, we refute the excuses that evil people make for not being encouraged toward virtue, and record the principles by which one should be earnestly encouraged toward the path of virtue. In the next part, we extol the glory of virtue and show the respective ways of endeavoring and the wisdom to prevent evil. Furthermore, even if we speak of the mighty virtue of goodness, if we do not guide the way of striving for it, how can we fathom the depths of spiritual practice? Therefore, here we guide all manner of virtuous practices. Regarding this, a certain scholar said, "The beginning of virtue lies in rejecting evil, and thus there will be merit in striving for other virtues as well."

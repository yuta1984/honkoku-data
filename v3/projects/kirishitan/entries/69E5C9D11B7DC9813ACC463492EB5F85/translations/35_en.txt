you will not." This is because you hate discipline and instruction, do not have true fear, and do not follow my teachings. This truly reveals the principle that final repentance can never be complete. Given this, what response can ordinary people of today possibly make? When God directly informs us of such dangerous matters through His own words, how can we not fear and revere Him, and how can there be such folly as not preparing for our final moments in advance?

Listen also to another word no less significant than this. Once, our Lord taught His disciples about preparing for the time when He would descend for the judgment of Judea, using many parables to emphasize this as a matter of utmost importance. In those words: "Beatus ille servus, quem cum venerit dominus eius, invenerit sic facientem. Mat. 24." (Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing) as seen in Matthew chapter 24. But if an evil servant thinks that his master's coming is not yet near and that preparation is still far off, and indulges only in pleasure and revelry, troubling others and puffing himself up with pride, when the master comes at an unexpected time, he will cut him in two and assign him a place with the hypocrites. Through this, our Lord shows that He knows even the thoughts of those who seek to do evil, and He teaches them beforehand that all their hopes will come to nothing. Therefore, understand that you are that evil servant. When you think there is still time and indulge in fine food and sink into countless sins, how can you not fear these words? Our Lord has the power and authority to do as His words declare. Therefore, He teaches you and admonishes you.

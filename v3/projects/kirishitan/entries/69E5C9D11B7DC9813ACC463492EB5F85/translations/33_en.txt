One should not only fear God's righteous judgment, but should hold Him most dear. Also, regarding matters to be done, do not act with a twisted heart. Only acting with free will is what matters most, as he states. What does it mean to think one can achieve this at the end of life without true repentance throughout one's lifetime? This would not be free repentance, but merely cowering repentance.

Third, regarding the limits of a wicked person's life: like a shadow that follows a form, until the very moment of death they do not separate from their evil temporary body, and it becomes entirely like their nature, making it difficult to overcome. Therefore, no matter how many people face their final moments, they do not think about their souls at all, but are deeply entangled in worldly attachments, lamenting only their desire to prolong their fleeting lives, acting as if their end will never come, never understanding their body's fate. This is because God sometimes brings this about as retribution for evil. As Saint Gregory states, one of God's punishments for the wicked is that as retribution for forgetting God during their lifetime, He abandons them at the end so they forget themselves. This is because they forgot the One who should be known above all in this world.

Fourth, observe how small and insignificant is the value of the merit to be sought at the end. Would there be anyone who understands God's matters well enough who does not realize that final efforts are more futile and difficult to achieve than the free efforts of ordinary times? This accords with the words of Saint Lucia.

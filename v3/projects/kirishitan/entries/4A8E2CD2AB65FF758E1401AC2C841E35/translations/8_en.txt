They presented as tribute: lapis lazuli jewels, one package of incense, ten pieces of dog fur, one agate desk, ten pieces of tiger fur, and fifty pieces of five-colored woolen cloth. Before long, they returned to the Nanban temple and again petitioned Nobunaga, saying: "The religion of the Heavenly Emperor (Christianity) widely saves people from illness, hardship, poverty, and suffering, bringing peace to their daily lives, and by transmitting the teachings, fulfills the wish for peace in this world and happiness in the next. We request that you grant us a medicinal garden where we can plant medicinal herbs and make preparations."

Nobunaga gave permission, saying "You may select suitable land within Yamashiro Province and neighboring provinces." The two Irmãos requested Mount Ibuki in Ōmi Province and received permission. They climbed this mountain and cleared an area of fifty chō square to create a medicinal garden, importing seeds and seedlings of three thousand varieties of medicinal herbs from their homeland to plant on Mount Ibuki. {{Note: For this reason, even two hundred years later, these roots remain on this mountain, and plants like Cnidium and mugwort have become specialties of this mountain.}}

Moreover, they imported vast amounts of treasure from their homeland, exchanged it for gold and silver, and acquired seven-treasure necklaces, gold brocade banners, brocade canopies, and sixty-one varieties of precious incense that perfumed the air even outside the temple gates, causing passersby to stop. {{Note: This temple is said to never have installed a principal Buddhist image on its altar.}}

When word of this spread, not only people from the five home provinces but also from Shikoku, Chūgoku, and provinces near the capital came in great numbers, and the Nanban temple was crowded with throngs of people daily. However, those who did not convert to their religion were not allowed to worship the principal image. The Nanban temple paid no attention to these crowds, instead sending people out into the capital and its surroundings, searching even in roadside halls in the mountains and fields and under bridges, bringing back outcasts, beggars, and others suffering from serious and incurable diseases, putting them in baths to cleanse their bodies

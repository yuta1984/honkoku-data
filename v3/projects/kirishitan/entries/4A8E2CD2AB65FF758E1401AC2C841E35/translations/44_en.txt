was the son of a king, and thus was indeed human. Being human, how could he possibly save people? Moreover, the five hundred vows that Shakyamuni made were vows established before the Lord God Deus. The nature of a vow is that one who makes a vow does so because there exists a lord who can receive that vow. If there were no Lord God to receive the vow, how could there be any established vow? People of the world do not understand this principle. They should think deeply about this. What use is there in upholding sutras and scrolls? In heaven, apart from Paradise, there is no place of peace and joy. What kind of Land of Tranquil Light could there be besides this?

Those who take the nembutsu as their practice rely on Amida Buddha, recite the sacred name with their mouths, and wish to be born in the Western Pure Land through this merit. This doctrine is wrong. The Sutra of Immeasurable Life says: "Long ago, there was a king who abandoned his country, renounced his throne, became a monk, and was called Dharmakara Bhiksu. In the presence of the Buddha Lokesvararaja, he established forty-eight vows, cultivated the practices of the Pure Land, and adorned his Buddha-land. When his vows were fulfilled, he dwelled peacefully in the west and was thereafter called Amida." This too was a human being. What is this Lokesvararaja?

The Lord God Deus created heaven, earth, and the world, gave birth to sentient and insentient beings, and manifested his great sovereign body throughout heaven, earth, and the world. Therefore, he is called the King of Self-Mastery in the World. The Western Pure Land refers to this human world below. People who contemplate Amida and wish for the Western realm are the height of foolishness.

As for Zen Buddhism: when the World-Honored One held up a flower and Kashyapa smiled—this teaching transmitted outside the scriptures, not establishing written words, directly pointing to the human mind, seeing one's nature and becoming Buddha—this is considered the supreme vehicle of Zen. However,

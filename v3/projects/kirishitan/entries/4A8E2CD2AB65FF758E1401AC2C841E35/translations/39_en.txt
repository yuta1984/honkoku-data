Although it records the schemes of the two padres Rukan and others, and the two irmãos Kerikori and Riisu, what we observe and hear in Japan makes these accounts unreliable. No books from that country have been transmitted, and it is most questionable and undoubtedly unreliable what kind of oral tradition was used to record the stories of that country. Therefore, I exclude the opening section and do not include it in this book.

The geography of the so-called Southern Barbarian Christian countries in this book is written based on the theories of Master Nishikawa Joken.

Looking at current world maps, we see Asia, Europe, Africa, America, and Oceania—these five great continents constitute what is commonly called the world. The book records that the country called Kōshinbi has forty-two provinces and is a great nation, unlike Japan and similar countries, but it does not appear among these five great continents, which is suspicious. Therefore, I omit such matters. Here I temporarily change the title and call it "Record of the Rise and Fall of the Nanban Temple."

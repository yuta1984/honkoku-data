"shows such compassion and mercy. You must not concern yourselves with this present world, but rely upon the eternal future." When they said this, many people joined their blood-stained hands in prayer and departed.

Among the sick people who gathered one after another, many of those who were difficult to cure died. However, about thirty people who suffered from serious diseases that were beyond the power of all physicians to treat were able to recover. Through such expedient means, countless people gradually came to submit to this sect.

Among them were three people who possessed wisdom and talent, became disciples of the Padre, and taught the ignorant masses.

One was a person from Kaga Province, a Zen monk who went by the name Keishun. This monk suffered from leprosy, his body was broken with pus and blood overflowing and swollen, he could not associate with other monks, and his parents were poor and humble and could not provide for his care. So he became a beggar, came to Kyoto, and collapsed near Makuzu-ga-hara. He was taken in by the Nanban temple, and after the two Irmão administered medicine for several months, his leprosy gradually healed and he was able to achieve complete recovery.

This monk was greatly delighted and said, "Truly through wondrous karmic connection I have received the vast benevolence of the heavenly emperor, my serious illness has suddenly been completely cured, and I have again obtained life in the human realm. To repay this great kindness, even if I crush my bones and break my body, it would be my true desire to do so for the sake of this religious sect," and he submitted in faith.

Another person was a merchant from the border of Izumi Province, a textile dealer named Yasuemon

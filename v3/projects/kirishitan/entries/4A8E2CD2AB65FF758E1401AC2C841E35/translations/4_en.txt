Prior to this, on the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month, the Sumiyoshi Shrine in Settsu Province experienced tremors and sixty-six pine trees fell down. The chief priest, Settsu-no-kami San-i Kunimune, reported this to the court. The imperial court deliberated and concluded that while the falling of pine trees itself was not particularly significant, the fact that the number was specifically sixty-six trees, corresponding to the number of provinces in Japan, should be considered an ominous sign. Therefore, temples and shrines were ordered to conduct prayers. This strange foreigner's arrival to spread heretical teachings and harm the people was likely a portent of this.

Thus, when the foreigner arrived at the castle town of Azuchi in Ōmi Province, he entered a temple called Myōhōji and rested for three days. On the third day of the ninth month, he was summoned to the castle, and Nobunaga granted him an audience.

Vulcan Bateren wore something called "abito" - a type of cloth resembling felt, with short hem and long sleeves, worn left-over-right. His appearance was quite base, his voice like a dove's cooing with incomprehensible speech. He looked most unsightly, like a bat with spread wings. He carried fine incense in his breast pocket, perfuming the palace halls.

Vulcan's method of paying respect to Nobunaga was a truly mysterious ritual: aligning the tips of both knees and extending them forward, folding both hands against his chest, and tilting his head back.

The items he presented were seven types: a telescope that could see seventy-five ri at a glance, a magnifying glass that could make mustard seeds appear like eggs, fifty tiger skins, felt measuring five chō square, a matchlock gun of unknown type, one hundred kin of aloe wood, a mosquito net for an eight-tatami room, and konpeitō (sugar confections) contained in an incense box measuring one sun and eight bu.

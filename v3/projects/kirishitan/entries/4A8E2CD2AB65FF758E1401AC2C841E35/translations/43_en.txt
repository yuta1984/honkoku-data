Men and women do not know the teachings of their sects, nor do they know the practices of their sects, much less the fundamental scriptures and doctrines they depend upon or the insights they have attained. The Zen sect, Pure Land sect, and Nichiren sect—these three sects are now flourishing in the world. Therefore, many people, both men and women, noble and common, place their names in these religious orders. Because of this, when people hear these nominal designations, they all say: "Buddhism is merely a teaching for receiving pleasure in the future life. What people need to know is limited to this alone. Though it may seem easy to understand, it is actually still not easy to comprehend."

The first day's discourse says: Buddhism takes "no-dharma" as its ultimate principle. In the verse where Shakyamuni transmitted the dharma to Kashyapa, it says: "The fundamental dharma of dharma is no-dharma." If everything is truly nothing, then why do heaven, earth, and all things exist? This is because the Lord God Deus created heaven, earth, and all things, and moreover, it is the great karmic teaching that saves all people in the world. Because they do not understand this principle, they propound theories of emptiness and make "no-dharma" their religious doctrine. Furthermore, when they teach the manifold dharmas of Mahayana, Hinayana, provisional and true teachings, exoteric and esoteric doctrines, they cause people to lose their way and become confused about the path. Therefore, the dharma teachers of various sects today all preach false dharmas and deceive men and women. Although there are many sectarian followers, to mention the three main sects first: the Nichiren sect takes refuge in Shakyamuni Buddha, upholds the Lotus Sutra, chants the title with their mouths, and desires to be born in the Land of Tranquil Light after death through this merit. This is the height of foolishness. Shakyamuni was from central India, son of King Shuddhodana

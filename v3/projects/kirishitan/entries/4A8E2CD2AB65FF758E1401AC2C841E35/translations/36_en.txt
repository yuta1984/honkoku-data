They must be arrested and tortured for information," he commanded. Immediately the two men were arrested and interrogated, and when they confessed clearly that they were the two men Kokushu Mōju-mon, they were executed by crucifixion at Awataguchi on the 19th day of the 9th month of Tenshō 16 (1588). From this time, orders were transmitted not only to Kyoto and Osaka but to all provinces, and those who secretly and privately hung images of the Heavenly Emperor and chanted mantras in faith were strictly investigated, so at this time this religious sect was largely exterminated.

From Tenshō 16 through the same 24th year to Keichō 16 (1611), in the western province of Higo, Katō Higo-no-kami Kiyomasa died of illness. Seizing this opportunity, in Higo Province's Uto District, there was a disciple of Baian who secretly propagated the Tentei sect, destroyed a Zen temple called Jikkō-ji in Funai Village of the same district, and drove out a monk named Shinzōshu. That monk became angry, went down to Edo, and filed a complaint with the Temples and Shrines Office. Then an official envoy came down from the Kantō region, investigated the faction, and pacified Uto District.

Sixteen years after Keichō 16, from around Kan'ei 3 (1626), there were people like the rokujūrokubu pilgrims who wandered to nearby provinces like Tanba and Ōmi, and also to distant provinces, giving gold and silver, showing the "Three Worlds Mirror," and going about making converts. As rumors spread that this sect was again arising in various provinces, official envoys from the government offices strictly investigated and arrested those who would not convert, putting them one by one into straw bags at Kyoto's Sanjō Riverbank and Osaka Castle's horse

translated as without birth or death. First, [God] created many anjos (angels) to constantly serve and attend [Him]. Among them there is a chief called Lucifer. He possessed all virtues and attained sovereignty, just like Deus. Next, [God] created heaven and earth, the world, and all phenomena. How was this done? With a single word "Fiat" (let it be), He created all worlds. When Deus conceived the creative thought, all things came into existence. Thereafter, He took pure earth and created a male child, naming him Adam. He made Adam sleep for three hours, took one rib from his right side as a foundation, and created a woman, naming her Eve. He made these two husband and wife and had them dwell in the country of Terrestrial (Paradise). This country was the most blissful place in the entire world, while all other countries became dwelling places for birds and beasts. He created fruits that would grant long life and provided them as food. Those who eat these fruits become bodies without birth or death. He also gave a prohibition, saying: "Among all the trees, there is the fruit of Maçã (the tree of knowledge of good and evil). Do not eat this. If you eat this fruit, you will fall to the dwelling places of birds and beasts and become bodies of birth, death, and suffering." Therefore, things that have a beginning and an end are birds, beasts, plants, and trees. Things that have a beginning but no end are heaven and earth, demons and spirits, and human souls. The Lord of Heaven is without beginning or end and is the origin of all things. Then that Lucifer sought to usurp the virtuous position of our Lord of Heaven

【Main text】
The meaning of this poem uses the term "Michinoku no shinobu-mojizuri" (the patterned cloth of Shinobu in Michinoku) as a makurakotoba (pillow word) to lead into the word "midare" (disorder/dishevelment). The question "who is responsible for my hair becoming disheveled?" is answered: it is only because my heart is disordered due to you. Shinobu-mojizuri refers to the practice of rubbing shinobu grass from Shinobu County in Ōshū onto cloth to create patterns. This is also called "suri-koromo" (rubbed garment).

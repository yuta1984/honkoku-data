Suō no Naishi (Lady Suō)

On a spring night
A pillow made of arms
Would be but a dream—
How regrettable it would be
If a meaningless reputation
Were to arise

Number 67

The meaning of this poem is as follows: When the court lady was serving at the imperial palace, she was looking for a pillow, saying "I wish I had a pillow." Someone then extended their arm through the bamboo blind, offering "use this as a pillow," so she composed this poem. She says that spring nights are short, and using such a fleeting arm-pillow like a dream would cause an unfounded romantic reputation to spread, which would be regrettable, so that arm cannot be used as a pillow. In the word "kainaku," she creates a wordplay combining "arm" (kaina) and "meaninglessly" (kai naku).

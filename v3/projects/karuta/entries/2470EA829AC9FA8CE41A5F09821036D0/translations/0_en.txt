Taira no Kanemori

Though I tried to hide it,
　my love has
　　shown itself
in my appearance—
　so much so that people
　　ask me
if something troubles me.

The meaning of this poem is: Though I thought I could keep it completely hidden, people became suspicious and asked "Are you troubled by something?" to the extent that my love became so apparent to others—how deep this love must be! Now my heart has grown weak in its ability to conceal my feelings, and I composed this poem with a sigh in my heart. This is truly about painful love, and it is a poem rich in emotional depth.

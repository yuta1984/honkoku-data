Hyakunin Isshu Picture Commentary, Four

The heart of this poem lies in the incomparable beauty of Tago Bay. When one rows out in a boat and looks back, the vista extends endlessly, and one should deeply contemplate and appreciate the feeling of seeing the snow on Mount Fuji's peak that cannot be expressed in either heart or words. The most exquisite aspect is that without putting into words either the beauty of the seashore or the magnificence of the high peak, the poet merely describes their appearance.

Yamabe no Akahito

At Tago
Bay
rowing out
and looking—
pure white

on Fuji's
high peak
snow is
falling continuously

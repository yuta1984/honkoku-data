Emperor Go-Toba (Go-Toba-no-in)
People are dear to me,
People are resentful to me,
Because I think of this world
As tasteless and meaningless,
I am one who
Suffers in contemplation.

Number Ninety-nine
This poem expresses His Majesty's lament and concern about the world becoming corrupt and the righteous way of governance being taken lightly. "People are dear to me, people are resentful to me" refers to the various hearts of people in this world that are difficult to govern. Even regarding just one person, there are bad aspects even in those we consider good.
Therefore, the good aspects are dear and the bad aspects are resentful, and combining these feelings, he composed this poem expressing the world as "tasteless and meaningless."

Number 59
The heart of the poem "yasurahade" means:
Though evening came, I did not sleep right away, but waited anxiously for the person who promised to come tonight, believing they would surely come. However, the moon had already begun to tilt and sink behind the mountain ridge, yet that person did not come. If it would be like this, I should have slept early instead of waiting anxiously. But believing the person's false words to be true, I could not sleep and continued waiting, watching the moon all night until dawn - expressing the regret of that experience.

Akazome Emon
Without hesitation
I should have
slept,
but through the deep night
until the moon tilted,
I watched and waited

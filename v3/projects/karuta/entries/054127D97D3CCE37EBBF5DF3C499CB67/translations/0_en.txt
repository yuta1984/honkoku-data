Though you may scheme
In the depths of night
With the false cry of birds,
Never shall I let you pass
The barrier of Osaka
　Sei Shōnagon

The meaning of this poem draws upon the Chinese story of Mengchang Jun, who late at night tried to pass through a checkpoint by imitating the crow of a rooster. The gatekeeper, thinking it was a real rooster's call and that dawn had broken, opened the gate and let him pass. This poem references this historical tale. Though one might create false bird calls to deceive and pass through a real checkpoint, the barrier of love between men and women in this world is not so easily crossed.

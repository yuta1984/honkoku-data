My humble dwelling / lies southeast of the capital / here I live in peace / while others call this mountain / "the world-weary mountain"
　　○My hermitage is located in the Uji mountains, not far to the southeast of the capital. Other people
　　　say that even if one tries to live on this mountain, because it's close to the capital, worldly troubles
　　　still arise and one cannot truly dwell here, but I have been living here peacefully like this for many years

The cherry blossoms' / color has faded away / while I spent my days / gazing at the long spring rains / as my beauty waned
　　○Ah, the color of the flowers has already faded! Without even looking at them once,
　　　while I was troubled by heartbreak over an unfaithful and cold man, feeling helpless,

　　　the long rains fell and the flowers ended up like that

From Kokinshū, Winter section, composed while crossing Mount Shiga　　　Harumichi no Tsuraki
On the mountain stream / the barrier that wind has built / consists of autumn leaves / too thick to flow away

○What appears to be a barrier that the wind has brought and set up in the mountain stream are autumn leaves that remain there without flowing away. The wind has blown so densely that the fallen autumn leaves pile up like a dam and flow along, but instead of flowing smoothly downstream, they accumulate and stagnate like a barrier.

From Kokinshū, Spring section, composed about cherry blossoms scattering　　　Ki no Tomonori  
On this spring day / when heaven's light shines / gently and calmly / why do the blossoms fall / with such restless hearts?

○On a spring day when the sunlight is gentle and leisurely, for what reason do the flowers scatter in this restless, unsettled manner?

From Kokinshū, Miscellaneous section, topic unknown　　　Fujiwara no Okikaze
Whom shall I make / my intimate friend? / Even the pine of Takasago / is not a companion from the old days

○I have grown so very old that now all my contemporaries have died, but who shall I befriend? Though the pine on the mountain is ancient, it too is not a friend from the old days and cannot be a companion. There is scarcely anything other than pines that has aged as much as I have.

From Kokinshū, Spring section, composed when visiting someone's house where he used to lodge whenever going to Hatsuse, but after a long time without staying there, when he finally arrived, the master of the house said "Certainly your lodging is still here," so he picked a plum blossom growing there and composed this poem　　　Ki no Tsurayuki
I cannot tell / what people's hearts may hold / but in this old village / the flowers still give off / the same fragrance as before

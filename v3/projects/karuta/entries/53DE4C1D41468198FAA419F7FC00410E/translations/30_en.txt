This is the work of someone who has made the ancient meanings and words their own, and it is not a task that ordinary people should attempt lightly. That I have immaturely tried to imitate this is entirely due to the teachings of our Master [Motoori Norinaga], as I thought this would also help with my own study of poetry. Now, when someone requested that this be carved on woodblocks for publication, it was difficult to decline, so it has come to be in this form.

◯ For particles like "to" and "zo," there are no suitable words for translation. Sometimes they can be understood as "ga," but particularly emphatic "zo" particles cannot be adequately expressed with "ga" alone, so now I add the word "sa" in translation. "Koso" can sometimes be understood as "koso" even in colloquial language, but it can also be translated in the same manner as "zo."

◯ The auxiliary "n" is expressed as "u" in colloquial language. "Kon" (will come) and "yukamu" (will go) become "kou" and "ikou," respectively.

◯ "Ran" has various translations: "dearou," "kashiranu," "yara," etc. The "ka" in "kashiranu" and the "ya" in "yara" are both interrogative particles that combine with "ramu."

◯ "Rashi" is translated as "sou na." "Sou na" comes from "sama naru," contracted through sound change.

◯ "Kana" - while colloquial language also uses "kana," using the colloquial form directly often sounds harsh, so I change the wording or alter the word order in translation. This is an exclamatory word that often contains deep emotion, so I add words to express that feeling.

◯ "Tsutsu" that continues without returning to the preceding clause is translated as "te," and words expressing the implied meaning are added.

◯ "Keri," "keru," "kere" are all translated as "wai." When "keri," "keru," "kere" appear within unbroken phrases, they are not specifically translated.

◯ "Nari," "naru," "nare" are all translated as "jya." "Jya" is a contraction of "de aru" with the "ru" omitted. This is the same as saying "da" in eastern regions. However, "nari" in phrases like "furusato samuku kinu utsu nari" cannot be understood when translated as "jya." In such cases, "kinu utsu" should be translated something like "aredo."

◯ "Nu," "nuru," "tsu," "tsuru," "tari," "taru," etc., are all expressed as "ta." Like translating "nari nu" as "natta" and "ki tsuru" as "kita."

◯ "Ahare" is often translated as "aa hare." The reason for this translation is that "ahare" originally represents an exclamatory voice, combining "aa" and "hare" as in expressions like "aa yoi tsuki ya" (ah, what a fine moon!) or "hare migoto na hana ya" (how splendid these flowers are!).

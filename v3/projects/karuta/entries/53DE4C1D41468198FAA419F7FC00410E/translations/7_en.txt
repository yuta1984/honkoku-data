From Kokinshū, Spring section, when Emperor Ninwa was still a prince, he bestowed young herbs on someone with this imperial poem　　　Emperor Kōkō
For your sake I went / to the spring fields to gather / these young tender herbs / while upon my sleeves the snow / kept falling as I picked them
　　○I went to the fields intending to offer these to you, and picked these young herbs, but it was
　　　exceptionally cold and snow kept falling on my sleeves—these herbs were gathered with great difficulty

　　　From Kokinshū, Parting section, topic unknown　　　Ariwara no Yukihira
Now I take my leave / if you should hear that the pine / on Inaba mountain / waits for me, I shall return / to you immediately  
　　○Now I depart from the capital and go down to Inaba province, but if you should hear
　　　that the pine growing on Mount Inaba's peak is "waiting" (playing on the word "matsu" meaning both "pine" and "wait"),
　　　I will return immediately

　　　From Kokinshū, Autumn section, when Nijō Empress was called the Crown Prince's consort,
　　　　　　　　composed on the topic of a painting on a folding screen
　　　　　　　　showing autumn leaves flowing in the Tatsuta River　　　Ariwara no Narihira
Even in the age / of the gods such wonders were / never heard before— / the Tatsuta River / tie-dyeing its waters red
　　○Looking at this Tatsuta River where autumn leaves flow thickly, it appears exactly like red
　　　tie-dyed silk. How truly wondrous! In the age of the gods there were various miraculous things,
　　　but even in that divine age, no one ever heard of a river tie-dyeing its waters crimson
　　　《Marginal note: Chiaki says that tie-dyeing appears in the legal codes and is called "kōketsu"》 as seen in the magnifying glass

　　　From Kokinshū, Love section, from a poetry contest at the Empress's court during Emperor Kanpyō's reign　　　Fujiwara no Toshiyuki
Like waves that approach / the shores of Suminoe / even in the night / do people's eyes watch closely / the path that leads through dreams?

Sanoki (Publisher's name)

Sutoku-in (Emperor Sutoku)
Because the rapids
　are swift, even though
　the torrent is blocked
　by rocks
and divides,
I believe we shall meet
again in the end.
　Number 77

The meaning of this poem is as follows: just as waves that are broken by rocks in swift rapids divide but then come together again to flow as one, so too with my love - even if we have a falling out and separate once, since you are the one with whom I first exchanged intimate vows, as long as our hearts remain unchanged toward each other, there will surely come a time when we meet again in the end. This is a clear and lucid imperial poem.

【Main Text】
The heart of this poem expresses how, when dew has settled densely on the grasses and trees of the autumn fields, and a sudden fierce wind arises, the dewdrops scatter in all directions, appearing just like pearls that have not been strung and secured on a thread, dispersing in disorder. It describes the wind blowing intensely and continuously. "Tsuraniki tomenu" means pearls that are connected and secured with thread.

On white dew
the wind
blows fiercely—
in the autumn fields

【Playing Cards on Screen - Lower Verse】
not strung
and secured,
the pearls scatter
indeed

Kiyohara no Fukayabu
The summer night,
still seeming
like early
evening,
has already dawned—
where in the clouds
does the moon lodge?

【Right page upper】
The meaning of this poem is: although summer nights are quick to dawn, when one wishes to admire the moon and enjoy its beauty, the shortness of the night makes it seem as though what feels like early evening has already quickly turned to dawn, yet where in the clouds is the moon lodging? It cannot yet reach its destination—this expresses deep regret for the moon's departure. The preface states "composed toward dawn on a night when the moon was beautiful." This is truly an elegant and touching poem.

Bunya no Asayasu
White dew
scattered
by the blowing
wind
across autumn fields—
like unstrung jewels
that scatter and fall

【Left page upper】
The meaning of this poem is: when the wind blew violently upon the dew that had settled on the indescribably beautiful various flowers of the autumn field, the scattered appearance was just like unstrung jewels, he composed. The heart that admires and enjoys beauty is elegant, and the words are refined and authentic. This "wind blowing violently" means "fierce, rough wind." This poem has no particularly deep meaning; it is an impromptu composition about the scene of wind blowing. "Unstrung" means that since jewels are things to be threaded on string, this refers to them being scattered in disorder without being properly strung together.

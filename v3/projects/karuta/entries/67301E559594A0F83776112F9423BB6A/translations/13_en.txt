Bunya no Yasuhide
When the wind blows,
the autumn
grasses and trees
wither—
truly, that must be why
mountain wind is called "arashi" (storm)

【Right page upper】
The heart of this poem: As the autumn wind blows and the grasses and trees wither away completely, one thinks that indeed, the character written as "mountain wind" and read as "arashi" must have been conceived from this very moment. "Mube" means "indeed" or "truly." This poem is said to be from Prince Koresada's poetry contest. It is mentioned in the preface to the Kokinshū as belonging to the realm of "skillful wordplay." It is a poem with many interpretations. There is a theory that says "on every tree flowers have bloomed" uses the tree radical with the character "every" to create "plum" (ume), and mountain crown with "wind" to create "storm" (arashi), but this is hard to accept. It should simply be understood as "rough wind."

Ōe no Chisato
When I look at the moon,
in countless ways
things seem
so sad—
though this autumn
is not mine alone

【Left page upper】
The heart of this poem: When looking at the moon, various things come to mind, and it seems as if limitless sadness clings to one's being. "Chiji" is written with the characters for "thousand-thousand," meaning "countless" or "various." "My body alone" means that though this is not an autumn for me alone, it feels as if I alone am sad. It is also said that the sun, being yang energy, brings harmony to the heart when faced. The moon, being yin energy, when gazed upon, purifies the heart and gradually deepens one's sense of pathos. Therefore, "in countless ways things seem so sad" expresses an immeasurably profound pathos.

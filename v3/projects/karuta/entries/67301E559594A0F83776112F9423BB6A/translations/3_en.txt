　Empress Jitō
Spring has passed
And summer seems to have come—
They say that on Mount Kagu
Of heaven
White robes
Are hung to dry

This is a poem about changing clothes on the first day of the fourth month. The mountain that was hazy during the three months of spring has cleared early today, and the white clouds appear as if summer robes were hung out to dry. Long ago, celestial beings hung their robes to dry on this mountain, which is why it is called Mount Kagu. In the Shin Kokin Wakashū, this poem is placed at the beginning of the summer section. In the Tales of Ise, it is included in the love section in connection with the phrase "replying only 'dew' would have been heartless." In both cases, it has been well-considered and appropriately categorized.
Kigin's commentary states that by not simply saying "summer" but rather "spring has passed and summer has come," the progression into early summer is made clear.

　Kakinomoto no Hitomaro
On the long trailing tail
Of the mountain pheasant
Dragging through the hills—
Long, long is this night
That I must sleep alone

The meaning of this poem is that "ashihiki" is a pillow word used to introduce "mountain," and also to set up phrases like "the mountain pheasant's tail is long and long." The idea is that even sleeping together on a long autumn night would be melancholy, so sleeping alone would be utterly unbearable. There is no special hidden meaning—it is simply that by beginning with "ashi-hiki no," the poet leads into "yamadori no o no" and then "naganagashi yo wo," creating a style of limitless elegance that is most excellent.
Kigin's commentary notes that rather than simply saying "nagaki yo" (long night), saying "naganagashi yo" makes the loneliness of sleeping alone sound infinitely more poignant.

Gidō Sanshi no Haha (Mother of the Minister of the Same Rank as the Three Dukes)
Since it would be
difficult to maintain
"I will not forget you"
until the distant future,
would that my life
might end
today.

The meaning of this poem is: a certain person came to visit her, but his heart seemed unreliable, so while he is now making happy promises, she wishes her life would end—there would be no point in suffering after being abandoned. This appears at the beginning of the Love section in the Shin-kokin-shū, with the headnote "around the time when the Middle Chancellor (Fujiwara no Michitaka) began visiting." Tōsetsu (Katō Bansai) explains that the poem's meaning is: "Even though you say you will not change no matter how many years pass, worldly circumstances have a tendency to change easily, so while you may think now that you will not forget me, it is extremely difficult to maintain that feeling until the distant future, so rather than lamenting when I am forgotten..."

Dainagon Kintō (Major Counselor Fujiwara no Kintō)
Though the sound
of the waterfall
has long since

The meaning of this poem is: long ago he went to see what was called Taki-dono (Waterfall Palace) at Daigaku-ji in Saga, but though that waterfall had already dried up, only its name still flows high in the world and can be heard. Daigaku-ji was originally a place of learning. Later it was changed to the character "gaku" (enlightenment). ○ In Kigin's commentary: "When there is no one left to tell of a place, naturally its charm cannot remain and it becomes buried in obscurity, but when a name remains, the emotions it evokes in remembering the past are particularly profound."

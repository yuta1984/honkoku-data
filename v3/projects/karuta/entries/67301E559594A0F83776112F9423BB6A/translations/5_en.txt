　Chūnagon Yakamochi
On the bridge
That the magpies
Have built across—
Seeing the whiteness
Of the frost
That lies there,
I know the night
Has grown late

This poem captures the spirit of the verse in Rōei that says "The moon sets, crows cry, and frost fills the sky." Yakamochi encountered a dark night and, facing a sky without moon that had grown cold, composed this in contemplation. "Frost filling the sky" does not mean it fell before one's eyes, but rather describes how the cold sky of a clear night appears to be filled with frost. This is the authoritative interpretation. The magpie refers to a crow; on Tanabata night, crows spread their wings to bridge the two stars—this is called the magpie's bridge.

　Abe no Nakamaro
When I look up
At the vast plain
Of heaven,
Is this the same moon
That rose over
Mount Mikasa
In Kasuga?

This poem was composed while viewing the moon in China. Long ago, when Nakamaro went to China and was returning, he thought longingly of his homeland, and also reflected on the lingering attachment to his familiar temporary dwelling. Seeing the moon shining clearly from a harbor in that foreign land, the same moon that had risen over Mount Mikasa in the capital of Nara in Japan came to mind, and he felt a direct, unmediated emotion that transcended the separation between that country and this one, with deep pathos and boundless lingering feeling. At this time, there were also farewell poems that the Chinese people are said to have presented to him.

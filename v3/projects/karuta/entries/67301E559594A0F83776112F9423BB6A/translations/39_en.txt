Minamoto no Toshiyori Ason
How bitter it was—
this mountain wind from Hatsuse
of the one I love—
though I never prayed
for it to blow so fierce

The heart of this poem: Though I prayed to the Kannon of Hatsuse for some way to meet the person I love, that person's coldness remains fierce like a storm, and my prayers were in vain. I never prayed for it to be this way, he says. The headnote states: "When composing ten love poems at the house of Provisional Middle Counselor Toshitada, he composed this expressing the heart of 'love where prayers go unanswered.'" According to Lord Teika's "Outstanding Poems of Recent Times," regarding this poem: "It is composed with deep feeling. Even if one wished to learn it by heart, it would be difficult to recite continuously—truly it has an incomparable form."

Fujiwara no Mototoshi
With the promised
artemisia dew
as my very life—
alas, this year's autumn too
seems to be departing

This poem: A certain monk relied on Mototoshi and sought to become a lecturer at Nara's Yuima-e, but was not selected. When Mototoshi complained to the Lord of Hōshōji asking "How about this?", he replied "shimejigahara." This refers to the heart of the poem "Just rely on me, shimejigahara." However, when he was passed over again this autumn, Mototoshi, relating it to the transience of "artemisia dew as life," composed this poem complaining: "How sad that this year's autumn too passes by just like this." "Having made a promise" means having made an agreement beforehand. "Sasemo" refers to "artemisia grass." "Autumn too seems departing" means autumn too will return and go away.

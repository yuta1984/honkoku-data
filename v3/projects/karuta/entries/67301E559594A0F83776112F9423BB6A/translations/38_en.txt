Famous though they are,
these fickle waves
of Takashi shore—
lest my sleeves get wet,
I shall not cast them there
Yūshi Naishinnō-ke no Kii

The heart of this poem: Takashi shore is a famous place. "Fickle waves" is likened to "a fickle person" and "famous" refers to being well-known. If one were to cast those fickle waves, one's sleeves would surely get wet. However, thinking of someone with whom one has made a pledge, even if they are fickle, they cannot simply be abandoned—this is a reply poem saying "no" to such a person from the beginning. "Wet sleeves" refers to tears. From "famous" to "lest they get wet," everything on the surface relates to waves as a poetic association. There is no place where heart-words are employed, and it is a well-composed poem.

Former Middle Counselor Masafusa
The cherry blossoms
on the peak
of Takasago
have bloomed—
if only the mist on the distant mountains
would not rise

The heart of this poem: Takasago is a famous place and also a general name for mountains, being a high mountain. "Peak" refers to the middle slope of a mountain. "Distant mountains" refers to the entrance mountains at the foot of the mountain. Even when flowers are not blooming, mountains shrouded in mist over the peaks are interesting. When flowers bloom, mist becomes unnecessary. He wishes it would not rise before the mountains. According to Genshi's commentary, "This Takasago is a general name for mountains, not a famous place. The meaning is clear and it is a poem in the orthodox style. It is simply a poem with refreshing diction and dignity." According to Kigai, "The phrase 'have bloomed' shows a heart that takes pleasure in seeing cherry blossoms anew."

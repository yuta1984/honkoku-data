Minamoto no Muneyuki Ason
In mountain villages
winter's
loneliness
grows ever stronger—
thinking that both human presence and grasses
have withered away

【Right page upper】
The meaning of this poem is exactly as it appears on the surface. Though it is a mountain village, in spring and autumn there would be flowers and autumn leaves to provide some comfort, but in winter both human presence and grasses have withered away. Though loneliness belongs to mountain villages, in winter the loneliness is particularly pronounced, saying that both human presence and grasses have withered together—the lingering sentiment is limitless. "Human presence withering" means that human presence has grown distant. The headnote says it was "composed as a winter poem." Mountains are lonely throughout the four seasons. One should pay attention to the characters "winter zo" (winter indeed), and then to the characters "yamazato wa" (mountain villages)—this is the explanation of Sankō-in (Sanjōnishi Sanetaka).

Guessing at random
shall I
or shall I not
pluck them—
white chrysanthemum flowers
that the first frost
has left me wondering about

The meaning of this poem is wondering which is frost among the white chrysanthemum flowers where frost has settled all over. He composed it saying there is nothing to do but pluck them by guessing. "Kokoro-ate" (guessing at random) refers to conjecture. This poem is said to be about white chrysanthemum flowers. Now "orabaya oran" (shall I pluck or shall I pluck) is a repeated phrase. It means "if I were to pluck, should I pluck?" Both are hypothetical statements. This is a poem that loves both chrysanthemums and frost equally. It is a poem where one should put emphasis on the character "hatsu" (first) in "hatsushimo" (first frost). The first frost is also something not yet familiar to the eye.

Minamoto no Kanemasa
The plovers crying
as they travel
to and from
Awaji Island—
how many nights their voices
wake the barrier guard
of Suma from sleep

The heart of this poem: Staying overnight while traveling at the lonely bay of Suma, waking in the night and listening to the plovers' cries, finding it unbearable—thinking of this, the poet reflects that barrier guards in such places must wake many nights listening to the plovers' voices, finding it unbearably melancholy. This is a poem where the poet sympathizes with the hardships of the barrier guard who lives there permanently, compared to his own temporary night's lodging while traveling. Suma Bay is described even in the Tale of Genji as a place where "even fishermen's houses are few and far between." The meaning is: if even my single night of travel lodging is like this, how much more so must be the barrier guard's feelings.

Sakyō no Daibu Akisuke (Minister of the Left Capital Akisuke)
In the autumn wind
the trailing clouds
break apart—
through the gaps
the moonlight
leaks out,
how clear its radiance

The heart of this poem: The autumn wind blows the clouds into streamers, and though the shining moon is hidden, when its light occasionally emerges through gaps in those clouds, it seems even clearer than the scenery on a completely clear day. This poem may seem to lack interesting elements, but it truly captures reality as it is, expressing things naturally. Both its sentiment and language are elegant, and it also possesses lingering emotion.

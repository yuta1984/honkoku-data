Prince Motoyoshi
Being in distress,
now indeed
it is the same—
at Naniwa's
channel markers
I would stake
my very life
to meet you

The heart of this poem: "ima hata" should be understood as "now indeed." "Miwozukushi" are stakes erected as markers of the sea's depth. I too, like the channel markers, am troubled morning and evening with longing, and though there is no time to dry my sleeves, if I could meet just once, it would be good. According to the headnote, this poem was "sent to the Kyōgoku Imperial Consort after the affair became known." This was during Emperor Uda's reign, when he had made a promise with this imperial consort and visited her, but after it was discovered, he sent this poem. "When the matter came to light" refers to when the scandal or misfortune became public. Also, "mio wo tsukushite mo" means "even if I sacrifice my life." He expressed this by playing on "miwozukushi" (channel markers). It means he would risk his life to meet her.

Just because
you said
"I'll come soon"
through the long month
I have waited
for the dawn moon
to appear

The heart of this poem is not about a single night. From early autumn, just because of the promise "I'll come soon," thinking "surely," waiting and waiting, soon the long month arrived, and I waited for the dawn moon to appear. How deeply moving! Regarding this poem's line "I waited for the dawn moon to appear," Kenshō interpreted it as referring to one night. Lord Teika's interpretation is different. How many nights the moon has accumulated—from early autumn, autumn has already ended and the moon has become the dawn moon. This represents the distinction between other schools and our school. Also, "long month" refers to the ninth month.

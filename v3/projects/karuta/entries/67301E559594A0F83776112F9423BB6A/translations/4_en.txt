　Yamabe no Akahito
When I go out
To Tago Bay
And look around,
White snow is falling
On Fuji's lofty peak

【Right Page Top】
The meaning of this poem is that when one rows a boat out into Tago Bay and looks back, the view including Mount Fuji extends limitlessly, beyond what heart or words can express. One should contemplate deeply the feeling of seeing snow even on that high peak. The lingering emotion is boundless. This is why Akahito is praised even in the Kokin Wakashū as being "mysteriously skillful in poetry." Kigin's commentary states that the scene of going out to Tago Bay and viewing Fuji's high peak is beyond what words can describe, so by merely depicting that appearance, aesthetic charm is naturally contained within. Therefore, explaining the heart of this poem is also beyond what words can reach.

　Sarumaru Tayū
Deep in the mountains,
Treading through
The fallen maple leaves,
When I hear the cry
Of the calling deer—
Then autumn is truly sad

【Left Page Top】
The meaning of this poem is that although we say autumn is melancholy from the beginning, when the grasses and flowers bloom in profusion, when dew and moon are beautiful, and when the voices of all insects have their charm, it is at the end of autumn when that scenery has exhausted itself and the fallen leaves are desolate, and the deer cries unable to bear its longing for its mate—that is when autumn is truly sad. The five characters "oku yama ni" (deep in the mountains) are also crucial. The original commentary states: "As the maple leaves of the near mountains scatter gradually, if we ask when in autumn is most sad, it is when the deer cries in heartbreak—that autumn is most intensely sad." This autumn refers to the autumn of the secular world in general.

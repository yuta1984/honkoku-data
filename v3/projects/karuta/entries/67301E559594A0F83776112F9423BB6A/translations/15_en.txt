Teishin-kō (Fujiwara no Tadahira)
O leaves of autumn
on Ogura Mountain's
peaks—
if you have
a heart,
await yet another
imperial visit

【Right page upper】
This poem has a headnote stating that when Retired Emperor Tei-ji (Emperor Uda) made an imperial visit to the Ōi River and said "this is a place where an imperial visit should also occur," the poet composed this poem intending to report this matter to the emperor. The meaning is: since this lord (Teishin-kō) was in attendance when the retired emperor spoke thus, the visit has already taken place, but if the autumn leaves of Mount Ogura have a grateful heart, do not scatter away but wait to receive yet another imperial visit. Addressing heartless things by saying "if you have a heart" expresses the poet's own devotion and represents elegant sentiment. Also, for retired emperors one writes "gyōkō" (御幸) and for reigning emperors one writes "gyōkō" (行幸) as the standard practice.

Chūnagon Kanesuke (Fujiwara no Kanesuke)
At Mika Plain
where waters well up
and flow forth—
Izumi River,
when did I see you
that I should long for you so?

【Left page upper】
The meaning of this poem is to compare the endless nature of longing for someone to water welling up, using "Izumi River" and "itsu miki" (when did I see) as overlapping words that flow together. "When did I see and hear that I should feel such longing?"—wondering at his own heart that feels like welling water. Mika Plain and Izumi River are all famous places in Yamashiro Province. In the Shin-kokin collection it says "topic unknown." The poem's meaning encompasses both love where one meets but doesn't meet, and love for someone one has not yet met. Also "wakite nagaruru" (welling up and flowing) uses characters related to "izumi" (spring) in order to say "itsu miki" (when did I see). This is also a jo-ka (preface poem).

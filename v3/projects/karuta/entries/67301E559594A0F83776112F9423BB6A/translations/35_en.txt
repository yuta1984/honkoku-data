Former Dai-sōjō Gyōzon
Together
in pathos
think,
O mountain cherry—
apart from these blossoms,
there is no one else who knows

The heart of this poem: when this high priest entered Mount Ōmine, the state of this mountain was such that not only were there no human footprints at all, but even the plants and trees were unfamiliar, making him feel lonely. Standing by where the cherry blossoms were blooming, he composed: "Apart from these flowers, there is nothing else that knows me, and the flowers too have no one other than me to appreciate them. Therefore, both the flowers and I can only feel this pathos together." Being of such noble status yet entering this deep mountain and seeing the cherry blossoms in such an unusual circumstance, one should deeply contemplate the scene when understanding this poem.

Suō-no-naishi
On a spring night
like a dream,
this arm-pillow—
meaninglessly
the reputation that will arise
is precious indeed

The preface to this poem states: "Around the second month, on a bright moonlit night, when many people were staying up all night at Nijō-in, Suō-no-naishi lay down and whispered that she wanted a pillow. Hearing this, Dainagon Tadaie said 'use this as a pillow' and extended his arm from under the curtain, whereupon she composed this poem." The meaning is: using an arm-pillow for just the brief span of a spring night's dream, it would be regrettable for a scandalous reputation to arise meaninglessly and uselessly. Therefore, that arm is difficult to use as a pillow.

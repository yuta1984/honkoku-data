Not thinking
of my own
forgotten
self,
but of the one who
made that vow—
how precious
is that person's life

【Right page upper】
The meaning of this poem is: not thinking of my own self that has been forgotten, but feeling it would be precious and sad if the life of the person who received my vow and said "I will never forget you" were to end due to divine punishment for breaking that promise. Another annotation states that when someone made a vow using many shrines as witnesses, saying "if my heart should change, may my life also end," this was composed when that person's heart did change. The meaning is clear. However, not resenting the person who broke such a promise, but still caring for that person's life—this must be a poem of the deepest pathos.

In the shallow grass
of the small
field of
bamboo grass,
though I try to hide my feelings,
they overflow—why
do I long for that person so?

【Left page upper】
The meaning of this poem is: "shallow grass" is a makurakotoba (pillow word) to introduce "small field," and "bamboo grass field" is used to introduce "shinobu" (to hide/endure). Though I think I am hiding my feelings like this, why do my emotions overflow so much that they become visible to others? This expresses involuntary feelings. This is also a jo-ka (poem with introductory sequence). "Asajifu no ono" is not a specific famous place. So, though I try to hide my feelings, they are so excessive that they attract attention—why do I long for that person so much? This represents a heart severely reproaching itself.

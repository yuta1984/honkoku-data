Shōsanmi Ietaka (Third Court Rank Ietaka)
In the rustling wind
at Nara's
small stream
in the evening—
purification rituals are
the only sign of summer

【Right page top】
The heart of this poem: Nara's small stream is a famous place where the Water Month purification is performed. "Wind rustling through Nara" refers to the place name above. It conveys a sense of coolness. Misogi refers to the purification on the last day of the Water Month. Though today is still summer, the coolness and the visible surroundings are no different from autumn. Only the fact that this Water Month purification is being performed serves as a sign that it is still summer. The summer-crossing purification is a ritual expressing the desire to quickly transition to autumn. This is well-crafted poetry.

Retired Emperor Gotoba
People are precious,
people are also
resentful—
with such
bitterness
thinking of the world,
I am one lost in thought

The heart of this poem: "People are precious" refers to his compassionate thoughts for the people of the realm. However, since the world does not settle according to his wishes and the royal way has declined in this era, his concern for the people also makes people seem resentful and troubles his heart. Because of this, he composed "with such bitterness thinking of the world, I am lost in thought." This shows his gracious imperial heart. However, that there are places where his virtue and benevolence do not reach—even the sage emperors Yao and Shun had such limitations, so this is unavoidable.

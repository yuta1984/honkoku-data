　Minister of the Left Kawara no Sadaijin
In Michinoku,
the shinobu
tangled weave—
for whose sake
did my heart
begin to be
disordered, when it was not I?

The heart of this poem is "For whose sake did my disordered heart begin—it was disordered because of you." Since it alludes to the disordered pattern of cloth from Shinobu County in Ōshū, he says "shinobu" and extends it to say "disordered." This is a poem from the "unknown title" section of the Kokin Wakashū, and the first two lines serve as a preface to express "disordered." In the Kokin Wakashū it says "when it was not I who thought to be disordered." It also says that in Shinobu County of Ōshū, they rub shinobu grass onto cloth to create patterns, and since those patterns are disordered, it is used as a preface to express "disordered."

Emperor Kōkō
For your sake
I go out
to the spring fields
to pick
young herbs—
snow keeps falling
on my sleeves.

This poem was composed when he bestowed the seven spring herbs upon someone on the seventh day of the first month. The heart is: "For your sake I go out to the spring fields to pick young herbs, and though the lingering cold is severe and snow falls on my robes, how grateful is your thoughtful care for others even during this difficult time." This poem is said to be an imperial poem from when the Emperor Ninwa, while still a prince, bestowed young herbs upon someone. The Emperor Ninwa refers to Emperor Kōkō. To bestow young herbs means to grant good fortune. Since it is said that consuming young herbs on this day removes all illnesses, he did so in this manner.

Priest Saigyō
Does the moon
tell me to lament
and make me
think of things?
How accusatory
are my tears!

The heart of this poem: Generally, when people fall into melancholy thoughts, it comes from within themselves. It is not something that others make them do. During the day one can find distractions and pass the time, but at night when facing the moon, the heart becomes ever more clear and melancholy thoughts increase, and it seems as if the moon is causing these thoughts, so that one's tears spill forth in a resentful manner. This expresses his recognition of his own foolishness, yet with understanding. One should pay attention to the word "yaha" (does it?). "Kakotsу" (to blame/resent) changes meaning depending on the context. Here it expresses a heart full of resentment.

On the leaves of the maki tree
where the dew
from the sudden shower
has not yet
dried,
mist rises
in the autumn evening.

The heart of this poem: Mountains where maki trees and such stand should be understood as ancient mountains, or deep mountains. Autumn evenings are indescribably beautiful, and when a sudden shower falls and the scenery of the maki leaves becomes beautifully vivid, before even that dew has dried, autumn mist arises and ascends—he composed this saying that such scenery is beyond words. Unless one places oneself in that moment and that state of mind when reading poetry, it is difficult to appreciate the lingering emotion and scenic beauty. One should apply one's heart carefully to savor it.

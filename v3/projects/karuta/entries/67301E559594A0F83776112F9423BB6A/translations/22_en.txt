Taira no Kanemori
Though I try to hide
my feelings,
they have shown
in my expression—
my love
has become so obvious
that people ask if I'm troubled

【Right page upper】
The meaning of this poem is: though I tried to hide my feelings from others by enduring patiently, I could not endure completely, and so quickly my expression revealed my state that people even asked "Are you troubled by something?" This expresses his surprise at this situation. This is a poem from the Tentoku poetry contest. The meaning of the poem is clear. It is said that "guarding one's heart is like a fortress," yet even though I thought I was hiding my feelings quite firmly, when people became suspicious, I lamented in my heart, "Have I become so weakened by these thoughts?" This manner is most deeply moving. ○The Ki commentary says that the phrase "showed in my expression" conveys the sense of surprise: "So my feelings did show in my expression after all!"

The reputation
that I am in love
has already
spread so soon—
though I began
these feelings in secret

【Left page upper】
The meaning of this poem is: My reputation as someone who is in love has already spread so quickly! I thought people would never know as I kept it hidden, but unknowingly, my condition must have become visible to others. This is a poem paired with the previous one in the Tentoku poetry contest. "Koisucho" means "that I am in love." "Madaki" means "early/quickly." ○The Gi commentary states that the latter poem (this one) is somewhat superior. Truly, the use of language is unparalleled. In "Eika Ittai" the previous poem is praised. ○Kigin says: How quickly my reputation spread when not much time had passed since I first fell in love! Though I began loving in secret, because of the depth of my feelings, my condition quickly became apparent—this is how it sounds.

　Kisen Hōshi
My humble hut
Is in the southeast
Of the capital—
There I live apart,
Though people say
The world is a mountain of sorrows

【Right Page Top】
The meaning of this poem is that Kisen Hōshi built a hermitage on Mount Uji in the southeast of the capital and lives there, but while people say "the world is sorrowful," he himself lives there joyfully and comfortably. "Southeast of the capital" explains the geographical direction. What the preface to the Kokin Wakashū calls "unclear beginning and end" refers to the part where he says "hito wa iu nari" (people say) instead of what should be "yo wo ushi yama to hito wa iedomo" (though people say the world is a mountain of sorrows). Also, "viewing the autumn moon is like encountering clouds at dawn" must express a heart that finds things deeply regrettable.

　Ono no Komachi
The color of flowers
Has faded away
While I vainly
Spent my time
In this world
During the long rains

This poem expresses her feelings about aging in this world, using flowers as a metaphor. This is considered Komachi's finest poem in the Kokinshū and was included in that collection later. This poem has both surface and deeper interpretations. The surface interpretation is that she thought to appreciate the flowers when they bloomed, but living in this world brings many troubles, and while she was distracted by various things, the flowers she failed to see had faded. The deeper interpretation is that one's own physical decline is imperceptible to oneself. She simply sees the flowers' decline and reflects that her own body must have changed in the same way.

Sangi Masatsune (Counselor Masatsune)
At Miyoshino's
mountain,
autumn wind
in the deep
night,
in the old village
coldly
the fulling of clothes resounds

【Right page top】
The heart of this poem is set in the vicinity of Mount Miyoshino, where the wind blows desolately across the deeply advanced night. When one listens carefully, the autumn melancholy becomes particularly poignant with the sound of cloth-beating from distant villages, expressing the chill of sleeping alone. One should contemplate the heart of this poem about the sorrowful night when crickets cry. Though it may seem like nothing special, it is deeply moving. "Old village" refers to a lonely, humble hamlet.

Former Grand Abbot Jien
Presumptuously
over this
sorrowful
world's
people I spread
at my hermitage
ink-dyed sleeves

The heart of this poem: "Presumptuously" means "beyond one's capacity." "My hermitage" refers to Mount Hiei. Now that I have become the head priest of this mountain, I should be a practitioner who compassionately protects the people of the world like children, covering them with my sleeves. However, one so inadequate as myself merely dwells idly as master of this mountain. This is a poem composed through pure self-reflection.

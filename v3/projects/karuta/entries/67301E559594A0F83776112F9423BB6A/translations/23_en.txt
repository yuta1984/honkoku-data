Kiyohara no Motosuke
We made a promise,
both of us
wringing our sleeves
with tears—
that waves would never
cross Sue no Matsuyama

【Right page upper】
In this poem, "Sue no Matsuyama" is a famous place in Ōshū (northeastern Japan). ○This poem is based on the original poem: "If I were to harbor a fickle heart, abandoning you, then waves might even cross Sue no Matsuyama." "Katami ni" means "mutually" or "both of us." The original legend of this poem tells that when waves cross this mountain, my promise would change—everyone composed poems based on this story. The meaning is: What a promise we made about such fickle, changeable things—both wringing our sleeves with tears, vowing "the waves shall not cross!"—spoken with a somewhat ashamed heart. "Chigirikina" is an emphatic form of "we made a promise."

Middle Counselor Atsutada
Compared to
the feelings
after we met,
in the old days
I thought
I knew nothing
of yearning

The meaning of this poem is: Since I first began thinking of you, I lamented with the single desire to meet you, but after spending one night together, comparing the old days when we hadn't met with the pain after our parting morning, indeed the old days seem like I had no cares at all—my feelings have grown even stronger. Also, as the element of "enduring in secret" is added, before we met there was nothing worth agonizing over. Moreover, at the beginning of love, I wondered if I might catch a glimpse of your form, and seeing your image in my mind, I thought to exchange words with you—gradually my thoughts accumulated. Though this poem sounds simple, it is a poem of deep feeling.

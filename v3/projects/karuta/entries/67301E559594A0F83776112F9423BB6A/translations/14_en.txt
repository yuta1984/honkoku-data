Kanke (Sugawara no Michizane)
On this journey
I could not prepare
proper offerings—
at Mount Tamuke
may this brocade of autumn leaves
serve at the gods' pleasure

【Right page upper】
This poem was composed by Sugawara no Michizane when he went to Mount Tamuke, serving in attendance. The meaning is: since this is a matter of accompanying [the emperor], I could not prepare proper ritual offerings, so I offer this brocade of autumn leaves found on this mountain as it is, as an offering to the gods. "Nusa" refers to the ritual offerings presented to the gods. "Kami no manimani" means "according to the gods' will" or "at the gods' pleasure." The headnote states it was composed "when Emperor Suzaku visited Nara, at Mount Tamuke." "Kono tabi" can also mean "journey" from the character for "travel." Also, in ancient times, brocade was used for ritual offerings.

Sanjō Udaijin (Fujiwara no Sadakata)
If it lives up
to its name,
Osaka Mountain's
sanekazura vine—
would there were a way to come
unknown to others

【Left page upper】
The meaning of this poem is: if it lives up to Osaka Mountain's name of "meeting," would that there were a way to truly come without breaking promises. "Sane" means "truth" or "reality." "Sanekazura" is a type of ivy. From "kazura" (vine) comes the word-play connection with "kuru" (to come). "Hito ni shirare de" means wishing for a way to come secretly without being known to others. The headnote says it was "sent to a woman." Now, sanekazura, when pulled, has thick growth, so one cannot see where it comes from. Similarly, he wishes that the person he loves would come without the world knowing. "Gana" is a word expressing a wish.

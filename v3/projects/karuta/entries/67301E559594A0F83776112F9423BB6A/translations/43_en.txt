Weary of longing,
even so
my life
continues—
but what cannot bear
this sorrow are my tears.

The heart of this poem: "Weary of longing" refers to when one's romantic thoughts have reached their absolute limit. The person I thought would surely reciprocate has become completely indifferent, and I alone am consumed with thoughts, with endless heartache. Even so, my life continues unharmed, and as long as I live on, there may come another opportunity to fulfill my feelings—though I resign myself well to this, the only thing that cannot endure this melancholy are my tears, which flow unstoppably no matter how I try to stop them. ○Kigin's commentary suggests an admonishing tone: "Though you are weary of longing, your life continues—are only your tears unable to bear this sorrow?"

O world—
there is no path
of escape!
Even deep
in the mountains
where I retreat,
the deer cry mournfully.

The heart of this poem: There is no path to escape from this sorrowful world. Even when one withdraws deep into the mountains to hide oneself away, there too the sad voice of deer can be heard—expressing one's weariness with the world. Genshi says: The heart of the poem takes in all the sorrowful matters of the world, and when retreating deep into the mountains thinking "this is the end," hearing deer cry so mournfully, one realizes that even in the mountain depths there are sorrowful things of this world, and the heart that laments "O world, there is no path of escape" is clearly heard.

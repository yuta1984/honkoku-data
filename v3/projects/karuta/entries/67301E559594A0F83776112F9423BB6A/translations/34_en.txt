Gon-chūnagon Sadayori
At daybreak,
through the river mist
of Uji,
appearing intermittently
across the shallows,
the fish-weir stakes

【Right Page Top】
The heart of this poem has the theme "Riverside View." At early dawn, through the intermittent gaps in the river mist of Uji, the fish-weir stakes can be faintly seen, which is deeply moving. In the Senzaishū, Volume Six, Winter Section, the preface states "Composed when visiting Uji." This was composed in reference to Hitomaro's poem: "The warriors' eighty Uji River fish-weir stakes - the waves that hesitate there, their destination unknown." Fish-weir stakes refer to the wooden stakes driven into river shallows to create structures for catching fish. "Intermittently" refers to the mist breaking and continuing alternately.

Lamenting in resentment,
even these sleeves
that will not dry
remain,
yet the reputation
that will decay from love—
how precious it is

【Left Page Top】
The heart of this poem is lamenting in resentment, with sleeves that do not dry from tears and even decay, yet grieving for the reputation that will decay meaninglessly due to love. Genshi comments that "how precious the reputation that will decay from love" means "if this were a mutual love affair, at least there might be some honor in it." The seasonal commentary states: "Lamenting in resentment is a painful condition. With no respite from parting tears, the sleeves decaying shows particularly deep feelings, and that even one's reputation should decay represents grief that truly overwhelms the person."

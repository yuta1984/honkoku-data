Daini no Sanmi
Mount Arima—
when the wind blows
through Ina's
bamboo grass plains,
oh no! How could I
forget you?

This poem has a headnote that says "composed in response to a man who had grown cold saying 'I am so worried about you.'" "Mount Arima" is a makurakotoba (pillow word) used to introduce "Ina's bamboo grass plains." "When the wind blows" is used to lead into "ide soyo" (oh no!). This is a jo-ka (preface poem technique). The meaning is: when a man with whom she had exchanged vows said things like "you must have already forgotten me," she replied with this poem meaning "even if you have become indifferent, following your example, would I so quickly forget someone? I am not such a faithless person."

Without hesitation
I should have
gone to sleep,
but instead I watched
the moon
until late into the night
as it tilted in the sky.

In this poem, "yasurau" means for the heart to settle down. Thus "yasuraade" means without settling down. A person with whom she had exchanged words promised "I will come tonight," so my heart was at ease, expecting he would surely come. When evening came, I could not sleep, gazing at the moon thinking "has he come now?" But though I waited and waited, he did not visit. Soon the night grew late and the moon tilted greatly, but that person never came after all. If it was going to be like this, I should have gone to sleep early without letting my heart be unsettled—this poem was composed in regret.

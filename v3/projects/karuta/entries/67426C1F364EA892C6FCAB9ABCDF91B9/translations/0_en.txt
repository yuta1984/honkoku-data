Minamoto no Toshiyori Ason

That person who was cruel to me—
I never prayed for them
to wither away
as harshly
as the mountain winds
　　of Hatsuse

　　　Number 74
The meaning of this poem is that Hatsuse is located in the mountains where storms are violent. The overall sentiment is "I never prayed for that cruel person to wither away harshly." "Hatsuse no yamaaroshi" (mountain winds of Hatsuse) is a makurakotoba (pillow word) for "river."
No matter how much one prays, people's hearts change violently, so the poet simply says "I never prayed for them to wither away so harshly." Lord Teika commented that this poem has "deep feeling that even modern waka cannot truly match in its excellence."

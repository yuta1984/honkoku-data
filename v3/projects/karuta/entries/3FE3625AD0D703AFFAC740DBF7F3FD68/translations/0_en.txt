Wada no hara
Kogi idete mireba  
Hisakata no
Kumo i ni magau
Okitsu shiranami

(Translation: At Wada Bay / Rowing out to sea and gazing / The eternal / White waves on the offing / Blend with the cloudy heavens)

The meaning of this poem is that "Wada no hara" is a general name for the sea.
Rowing a boat far out to sea and gazing around, truly
the clouds and waves become one, stretching out
endlessly into the distance. "Hisakata" is
a pillow word (makurakotoba)
used before "clouds."
This poem truly expresses well
the meaning of the sea's
boundless expanse,
and its lingering emotion is limitless.

思ひわび
さても命は
あるものを
憂きに堪へぬは
涙なりけり

Number 81

The meaning of this poem is that "omoi wabi" means being completely overwhelmed with worry and despair. The person I relied upon has become cold and distant, and now my heart is filled with thoughts that lead nowhere but deeper despair. In such a state, my life seems ready to fade away, yet life stubbornly persists. What cannot endure such painful circumstances are my tears.

"Taenu" means being unable to endure or bear something.

Number Fifty-One
The heart of this poem compares burning passionate love to "sashimo-gusa" (moxa grass). The poem expresses that the feelings overflowing in my chest, like the moxa of Mount Ibuki, are so intense that I cannot even say "this much," and since I cannot express how these feelings are, how could that person possibly know? It captures the poignant loneliness of thinking alone about this heart's anguish, with nowhere to direct these overwhelming emotions.
"Sashimo shiraji na" means that person surely would not know of such things.

Fujiwara no Sanekata Ason
Even saying
"this much"
I cannot—
like the moxa grass
of Mount Ibuki,
you surely do not know
of my burning love

Hyakunin Isshu Illustrated Commentary, Number 31

This poem was composed while crossing the mountains of Shiga.
The wind has blown the leaves from the mountain trees densely,
and they have become a dam in the water, blocking the flow.
What is this dam that the wind has created?
Looking closely, it is autumn leaves that even
block the river's flow.
This is a poem where the poet asks himself and answers himself.
A "shigarami" (dam) is normally
something people construct by hand in a river.
However, saying that the wind created it
is an unusual expression and quite elegant.

Harumichi no Tsuraki
In the mountain river
the wind has
created
a dam—

even the flow
cannot pass through
these autumn leaves

Hyakunin Isshu Illustrated Commentary, Thirty-Two

【Main Text】
This sentiment is that while flowers scattering and falling in rain and wind is inevitable, what does it mean for flowers to scatter when the sunlight is gentle and peaceful? Though spring days are tranquil, why do the flowers fall so hastily without a peaceful heart? This expresses deep resentment directed at the flowers. The phrases "why," "flowers," and "without a peaceful heart" should be understood by reading them together with the word "flowers."

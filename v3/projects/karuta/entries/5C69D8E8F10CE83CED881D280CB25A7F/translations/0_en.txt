Middle Counselor Asatada (Chūnagon Asatada)
If there were no such thing
　as meeting at all,
　it would be far better—
then I would not resent
　either you or myself.

[Left page]
The meaning of the poem on the right is that if there were no such thing as meeting one's beloved in this world, it would actually be better. However, this does not mean he dislikes meeting. It is because when one meets, there is also the sadness of parting, and when relationships are interrupted, both longing and resentment arise, which is painful. One should pay attention to the phrase "nakanaka ni" (far better/rather). This poem expresses the heart of love that involves both meeting and not meeting. It speaks of something that has been cultivated with devotion over many days.

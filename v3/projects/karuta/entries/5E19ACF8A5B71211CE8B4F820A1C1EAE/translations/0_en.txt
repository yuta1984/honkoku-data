Hyakunin Isshu Picture Commentary, Number 34

【Main Text】
The meaning of this poem is "As for people, I wonder - people do not know." There is emphasis on the particle "ha" (は) in "hito ha" (人は). When the master of the lodging at Hatsuse resented that Tsuneyuki had not visited for a long time, he said that whatever people may think, at least these flowers know that his heart does not neglect them, so they bloom with the same fragrance as in the past, showing no resentful color. "Furusato" (hometown/familiar place) refers to the lodging where he had stayed regularly for many years.

• Kansei 7th year (Year of the Rabbit), 7th month, 5th day, night: When Ōtani Dennai broke in and wounded his parents and younger sister with a blade, his elder brother Yaichirō was ill and lying in a three-tatami room at the front of their shared residence. Dennai snuck into their sleeping quarters and caused a disturbance. Regarding the above matter, though it was in a space equivalent to one room, both parents sustained wounds in several places, and even the younger sister was wounded - there appears to have been considerable time to act. Since it was already a matter where the parents' lives were at stake, there should have been appropriate ways to handle it. However, not only did he fail to strike down the assailant, but he allowed him to retreat completely unharmed, which is an extremely regrettable matter. This appears to reflect his usual mindset and conduct, and being inappropriate, he was confined to the upper sitting room.

Yukinobu's mother was a daughter of a certain Yamashita. When Yukinobu's father Genshichirō Tadamune died in battle, Yukinobu was still young, so he was raised by his uncle Hikōemon Mototada. In Keichō 5 (1600), year of the Rat,

when Gongen-sama (Tokugawa Ieyasu) went down to Ōshū to subjugate Kagekatsu, Hikoemon (Mototada) was ordered to serve as caretaker of Fushimi Castle and remained there. When Ishida Mitsunari attacked with a large army, claiming it was under Hideyori's command, the castle could not be defended, Mototada died in battle, and Fushimi Castle fell. At that time, two retainers named Yamashita Yagoei and Yagishita Gorōemon were sent with Yukinobu to the enemy camp. Soon after, the Battle of Sekigahara took place, and when Mitsunari's army was defeated, Yukinobu safely returned to his forces. In Keichō 7 (1602), year of the Dog, Tadamasa received imperial favor and was granted the 240,000-koku domain of Mogami in Ushū. However, when his son Tadatsune succeeded him, he died of illness in the 7th month of Kan'ei 13 (1636), year of the Rat, without an heir.

The enemy forces were drawn into Matsuno-maru, leading to the fall of the castle, and all the castle commanders died in battle on the first day of the eighth month. {{His posthumous Buddhist name was Chūryōin-den Suikotsu Giken Koji, burial place unknown, memorial tablet at Shōunzan Zenryūji Temple in Kitaaoki Village}} At that time, Matasaemon Tameji was six years old, and due to his youth, Tamamura's inheritance was received by his younger brother Yagorōzaemon Tameshige from the Torii family. When Tameji came of age, Tameshige transferred his stipend of 350 koku to Tameji, while he himself was granted a separate stipend of 350 koku. Later, when there was a marriage alliance with the Okudaira family, he was appointed to the position of senior retainer (oku-karō) and was immediately taken into service by the Okudaira family, serving them for generations. His descendants remain in the Nakatsu domain retainer group.

While Tamamura was serving the Torii family, Sakyōnosuke Tadatsune died young and the line was discontinued, so he immediately entered service with our lord's house.

Item: In the ninth month of Kan'ei 13, year of the rat, he was granted a stipend of 250 koku in Mogami, Dewa Province, summoned to service, and appointed to Imamura Denjūrō's unit.

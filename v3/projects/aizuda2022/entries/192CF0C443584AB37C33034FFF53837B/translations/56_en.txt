The matter of trainees that officials requested is not easy to
　　　　　appoint, as was previously instructed and understood,
　　　　　but if these persons are not properly trained and tempered, it will be difficult
　　　　　for them to serve when appointed to full positions, so
　　　　　please appoint them. This earnest request is
　　　　　reasonable, so the instruction to appoint them as trainees
　　　　　can be seen, but since there is no family tradition record, this is
　　　　　recorded

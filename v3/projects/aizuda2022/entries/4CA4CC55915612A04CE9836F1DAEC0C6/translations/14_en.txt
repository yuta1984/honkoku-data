His nobility, clarity, and wisdom were renowned throughout the world, and in matters he was entrusted with, how could there ever be any lack of capable people? Yet while he lived, they valued him greatly, and when he died, they mourned him deeply—such was the extent of their feelings.
Thus, one can imagine what kind of person Shōgen was. Having already recorded the facts, upon reviewing the manuscript again, it records the details of Shōgen's daily words and conduct. The essence of his teachings was: "Government affairs are manifold, but there are three major aspects: correcting the lord's heart is one, leading the domain retainers is one, and caring for the common people is one. These three things should be the foundation, and one must not be constrained by minor details. When affairs become complicated, there will be the trouble of burdening the people." He also said: "Those who serve their lord should eliminate desire. With desire comes disloyalty and unrighteousness rooted therein, and even courage cannot inspire such a person."

If there were those who praised his abilities, he would show displeasure, but if someone happened to point out his faults, he would relax his expression and show joy. He did not seek to hear about people's faults, nor did he lightly speak of people's virtues. What his lord loved, Shōgen also

Daughter　　　　Wife of Higuchi Kanzaburō Mitsutsu
　Mother [same as above]
　　On the 29th day of the 6th month of Kyōhō 20 (Year of the Rabbit), a request was made to arrange a marriage between Zenba Yahei's younger sister and Hara Sagoemon's wife, as recorded in the official records. However, there is no record of this on either side. Moreover, in Kurokawachi Chōzō's genealogy it states "Zenba Yatadayū Sadatsugu's daughter, wife of Gonhachirō Nakakiyo, divorced," and also the diary records that both the wives of the Satō and Higuchi retainers remarried. Therefore, it is unclear whether the woman divorced from the Kurokawachi family married into the Satō family, or whether the woman who broke off relations with the Hara family married into the Higuchi family - the evidence is inconclusive.

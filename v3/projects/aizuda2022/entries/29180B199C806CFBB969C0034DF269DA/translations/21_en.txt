served well, and I also worked diligently at horsemanship with good results. Since I had previously served as a page, based on both qualifications, I was appointed to the tozama-gumi unit. I was ordered to continue going to the stables as before and to work even harder at horsemanship. The stipend I had received until now was withdrawn.
　　　However, I was assigned to Ikoma Kuranosuke's unit.

• In the same month, because I continued to go to the stables as before and also served at the riding grounds during formal dress occasions, I was announced to be exempted from guard duty in the audience hall and various rotation duties.

• In the sixth month of the same year, I was appointed as stable superintendent.
　　　However, regarding continuing to serve as part of the tozama-gumi unit as before, the unit head Ikoma Kuranosuke conveyed this matter.

• In the twelfth month of the same year, regarding the officially approved secret horsemanship treatises that my father Jōemon was supposed to submit, when I previously requested through the inner guard to prepare and submit them, I was ordered to write and submit them as requested.

• In the intercalary twelfth month of the same year, I was granted Kimata Tominoshin's upper mansion.

Momozawa Sakon-no-suke Tamamasa, the 18th generation descendant of Shimotsuke-no-kami Mitsunobu, served as a vanguard for Lord Takeda Shingen. His son Sakon-no-suke Tameoki died in battle on March 15, 1573 (Tenshō 1), when Takeda Shingen attacked Iwamura Castle in Mino Province. His son Chikugo Tameyasu, his son Jirōzaemon Tamenori, and his son Ichirōemon Tamehiro were adopted by a rōnin named Toeda Taitō in Kawanakajima, Momozawa-shō, Inan district of Shinano Province, and therefore changed their family name to Toeda as well. Tamehiro had three sons: Toeda Jingorō, Bunzaburō, and Hanbei, but the fate of these three is unknown. Ichizaemon Tameshige was one of these three and inherited Taitō's family headship, and it is said that he was probably summoned to service in Mogami, though the details are unclear.

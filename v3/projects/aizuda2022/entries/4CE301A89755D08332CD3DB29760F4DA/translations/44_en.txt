to the inner chamber where detailed inquiries were made about the illness,
　　I reported my observations that this was definitely not a case of general weakness
　　but entirely a condition of accumulated heat. When I reported this, Lord Shinano-no-kami said
　　"Your opinion differs from that of the others, and your
　　assessment seems most reasonable." Therefore, he ordered me to prepare
　　medicine according to my opinion. When I presented the medicine,
　　[the patient] recovered appropriately.
　　　As a celebration for recovery from illness,
　　　both Lord Renjuin and Lord Shinano-no-kami each granted
　　　three pieces of silver

- Same year, fourth month: The medicinal allowance was increased by ten ryō
　　annually
- Same month:
　　When Lord Kyōteiin was about to depart for a journey, he fell ill
　　and departure became difficult, so I recommended postponement
　　and provided medicine, whereupon he quickly recovered
　　and was able to depart
- Same year, fifth month: [Permission was granted for] my nephew
　　Sōken, who had been under the care of Saitō Genryō, to become an adopted son-in-law
- Same year 5, Kinoto-mi year (1785), twelfth month: Last winter

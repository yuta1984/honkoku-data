On the way, on the night of the 7th of this month, they encountered an urgent messenger from Aizu. The message, signed jointly by the Council of Elders, stated that on the 1st of this month they had been ordered to guard the northern territories and should arrive at that location after mid-January. Since I was also scheduled to be dispatched to that location for various official duties, Naito Gensuke wrote in his own hand instructing the accompanying party to return urgently, which I acknowledged. We immediately turned back, traveling day and night at double speed, but as rain and snow continued to fall, the roads were extremely poor, and we barely managed to arrive on the evening of the 10th. Upon understanding the orders given, I immediately went to the meeting hall as I had during the summer and undertook all military duties, both large and small.

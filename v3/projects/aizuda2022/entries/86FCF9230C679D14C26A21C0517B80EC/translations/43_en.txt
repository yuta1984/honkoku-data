[The Russians] attacked Etorofu Island and committed various acts of violence and disorder. The number of duty personnel from the Shogunate, as well as from the Nambu and Tsugaru domains, was extremely inadequate, and gradually they lost control of the situation, resulting in casualties. They also caused disturbances at Ruutaka in Karafuto (Sakhalin), and encountered weapons ships dispatched by the Tsugaru and Matsumae domains off Riishiri, driving away the crew members and seizing cannons, other weapons, provisions, and rice. They also returned Japanese people they had captured the previous year from the same location, and it was heard that they declared they would commit further violence if their request for trade was not granted. In any case, this was a situation where preparations against foreign invasion could not be neglected. Particularly this past summer, there was an official order from Lord Doi Ooi-no-kami regarding assistance when foreign ships appeared along the coasts of neighboring provinces, instructing to maintain readiness. In the immediate vicinity, within Echigo Province closest to Aizu, there were no other major domains besides Takada, Nagaoka, Shibata, and Murakami, and given the nature of the region where preparations for Sado Province also had to be considered, unexpected deployments were not unlikely. They were instructed to secretly and thoroughly investigate all matters, beginning with coastal geography and the advantages and disadvantages of offense and defense. Since the alertness regarding troop deployment was not to be relaxed, they officially submitted a request for hot spring therapy within the domain, and Katamine Hosuke and Yokoyama Kazuma together, three people with one servant, were guided by the village inspector Ishii Jiroemon of Sado village.

- In the 8th month of Enkyō 2 (1745), it was announced that [his] diligent practice and mastery of martial arts had been specially recognized by his lord.

- In the 2nd month of Enkyō 3 (1746), he was appointed to the position of messenger (oshitsukaiban).

- In the 10th month of the same year, he went up to Edo for guard duty service.

- On the 8th day of the 12th month of the same year, word came that Matsudaira Kaga-no-kami Munetoki was seriously ill, and he was immediately dispatched as an attendant messenger to the Hongō residence. Finding that his condition was not light, successive orders were issued. When the lord set out and then switched to fast riding partway through the journey, [the subject] went out to the front gate to handle the lord's horse and report on the situation. By the lord's command, he then accompanied him right up to his seat.
　　Note: At this time the Kashū residence was in an unusual state, and particularly since it was nighttime and there was great urgency, only the sword attendant Miyake Tōzaemon and stable magistrate Itō Wasaemon accompanied on horseback, with just two others on foot - a situation where not everyone could keep up. However, since [the subject] had arrived first and generally understood the patient's condition, by the lord's consideration for caution, he was taken along right up to the seat.

- On the 16th day of the 4th month of Enkyō 4 (1747), when the Edo Ninomaru caught fire and personnel were dispatched, he received orders regarding fire prevention for the Honmaru and other areas, and went out to his designated position within the procession to perform his duties.

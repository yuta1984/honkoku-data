harmonizing is called "sacred measure," and the sage's way of harmony simply values moderation and
preserves one's natural essence. Some say "desire cannot be severed,"
and also according to Pengzu's words, "men cannot exist without women, women cannot
exist without men." Also, "if a person can limit emission of essence to twice per month, that amounts to only
twenty-four emissions per year, and one should attain a lifespan of one hundred years." All of these speak of how sexual desire
cannot be severed. Generally, all things in creation are entirely
gifts from Heaven. From human vision, hearing, speech, movement, to the four limbs and hundred bones, each
having its capabilities is also entirely a gift from Heaven. There is the heart organ for divine
knowledge, there are the spleen and stomach for eating and drinking,

and there are the kidneys for reproduction, so originally sexual desire is also
what Heaven bestows. There may be teachings that say this should be severed because it harms longevity or obstructs
moral virtue, but if one could step outside this heaven and earth,
that might be acceptable. For those who now dwell within this heaven and earth,
it is best to simply follow what Heaven grants. The Huainanzi states:
"People have the nature of sexual attraction, therefore there are grand marriage rites. They have the nature of eating and drinking,
therefore there are grand banquet ceremonies." Generally, when warning against sexual desire, one should only
warn against its excess. Long ago, a renowned physician named Yihe diagnosed an illness of Duke Ping of Jin
and said this was a disease of "keeping men distant while bringing women close."

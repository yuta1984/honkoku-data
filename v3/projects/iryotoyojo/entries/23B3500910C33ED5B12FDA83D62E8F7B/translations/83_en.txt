It may appear so. However, generally speaking, women by nature have the capacity for pregnancy, and pregnancy cannot develop without blood. Therefore, they have a surplus of blood sufficient to nurture that pregnancy. When pregnant, they use this surplus blood to nourish the fetus. When not pregnant, this excess blood is discharged downward once a month. This is called menstruation. Therefore, without menstruation there is no evidence of blood surplus, and without blood surplus there can be no fetal development. Moreover, since women are fundamentally of yin constitution and blood is also of the yin category, they are governed primarily by blood. Therefore, maintaining proper blood circulation is of utmost importance.

However, nothing corrupts and disrupts blood more severely than alcohol. When one drinks and the body and face become red, this clearly shows the reckless movement of blood. Due to this reckless movement, it further causes depletion and dispersion, leading to weakness and exhaustion. Those whose blood becomes corrupted and disordered cannot regulate their menstruation, and those who cannot regulate their menstruation cannot achieve proper fetal development. Even if they do conceive, if their blood is insufficient to nourish the fetus, they will inevitably suffer miscarriage. The *Inner Canon* states: "If one enters the bedchamber while intoxicated, the central qi becomes exhausted, injuring the liver, and menstruation becomes scanty and ceases." Generally, women who drink heavily either have excessive menstrual flow, or menstruation comes twice in one month, or they suffer from vaginal discharge that is not menstruation.

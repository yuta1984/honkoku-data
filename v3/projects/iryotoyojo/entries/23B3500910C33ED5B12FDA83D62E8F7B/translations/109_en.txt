accumulate day by day. Even heat pathogen alone corrupts the blood, let alone when one drinks heavily in addition. Generally, there is nothing that corrupts blood more severely than alcohol. Due to these two factors, the corrupted blood from the damaged areas seeps into the space between the intestines and stomach, eventually becoming dysentery. When it manifests as red and white discharge: if the corrupted blood passes through without stagnating for long, it directly discharges fresh blood. When it stagnates somewhat before passing, the blood color changes to pale red and discharges brownish material. When it stagnates for a long time before passing, the blood completely putrefies into white pus and discharges white matter. This is exactly like skin ulcers. When skin swellings burst before ripening, they discharge fresh blood; when they ripen somewhat, they discharge pale red; when fully ripened, they discharge bluish-white pus. All skin ulcers also begin with

initially just one type of corrupted blood. Due to the toxic influence of the ulcer, it transforms into pus. What is discharged in dysentery is no different from this. This is Zhang Zihe's theory that "red and white dysentery should not be differentiated by cold and heat, but only by new and old. For example, carbuncles begin with red blood and then ulcerate to become white pus." Because it becomes pus, it is viscous and sticky. Therefore, the Inner Classic discusses this condition as "intestinal obstruction with bloody stool," and also says "intestinal obstruction discharging white foam," and "intestinal obstruction discharging pus and blood," with no mention from the beginning of discharging food accumulation or fatty substances. During summer heat, when many people suffer from this condition, the suffering from heat affects noble and humble, old and weak alike without distinction. If so, equally

On Edema
○Edema occurs when urination does not flow properly and water qi fills the abdomen, gradually reaching the hands, feet, body, head, and face, causing swelling throughout. This condition has both excess and deficiency patterns, edema of the five organs, varieties of yin water and yang water, and also ten types of edema. Their names are each different. In men, swelling that spreads downward from above is auspicious, while swelling that rises upward from below is inauspicious. In women, swelling that rises upward from below is auspicious, while swelling that spreads downward from above is inauspicious. The Inner Classic states: "The kidneys are the gateway of the stomach.

water gathers and follows its kind." Although there are various types and origins of this condition, it mostly occurs in those who drink alcohol heavily. Alcohol first damages the spleen and kidneys, and also creates dampness-heat. On top of this, being affected externally by wind-cold and summer-heat dampness, and internally being harmed by food, drink, and cold raw foods, this condition is inevitably brought about. Ultimately, this condition is due to poor urination flow. The Inner Classic states: "The triple burner is the official of waterways and drainage, from which water passages emerge. The bladder is the official of regional governance, storing body fluids, and when qi transforms, it can discharge well." Due to the violent nature of alcohol qi and the reckless movement of alcohol heat, the organs lose their function. When the triple burner is not regulated, the water passages err in their discharge, and when the bladder is not regulated, the normal process of qi transformation and discharge goes awry, causing water qi to not follow the normal pathways but to overflow into the body.

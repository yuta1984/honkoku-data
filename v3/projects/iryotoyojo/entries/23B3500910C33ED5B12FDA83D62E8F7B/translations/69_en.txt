However, setting aside body, hair, and skin, how can one who destroys their life for the sake of alcohol achieve filial piety? Even if one does not consider this body as something weighty or sufficient, should they not exercise restraint in this matter on the path of loyalty and filial piety? The Book of Rites also says "Desires should not be given free rein." Or as it is said, "Pleasure should not be taken to extremes; when pleasure reaches its extreme, sorrow is born." Therefore, rather than suddenly taking pleasure to extremes and causing illness in one's prime years, it would be better to moderate one's pleasures and enjoy long-lasting joy until old age and one's final years.

For great men who naturally do not favor this, it should truly be called auspicious fortune and heavenly blessing. For those who do favor it but exercise good restraint and do not become addicted to it, it should be called courageous determination, wisdom, and heroism. Moreover, since favoring this stems from inherent robust strength, if only they would exercise caution against excess, they would enjoy limitless good health and longevity. This would bring happiness not only to themselves but also great fortune to the nation. Therefore, what should be deeply feared for nobles and great men is only this one matter of alcohol. I earnestly hope that people of the world will advocate and promote this, so that great men might, even if only briefly, hear and understand this message.

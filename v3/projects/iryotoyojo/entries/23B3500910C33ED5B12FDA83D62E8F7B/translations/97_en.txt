Those who drink excessively often develop this condition. What the ancients called wind, fire, dampness, phlegm, or deficiency of central qi - these too are caused by alcohol. Why is this so? Because the heat of alcohol readily opens the skin texture (cou li), which invites wind. It also stirs up fire, creates dampness, generates phlegm, and causes human qi and blood to flow exclusively outward, so it is clear that the central qi becomes deficient. Therefore, wind, fire, dampness, phlegm, and central qi deficiency are causes of apoplexy, while alcohol is the cause of wind-fire, dampness-phlegm, and central qi deficiency - so it should be called the cause of causes. Generally, apoplexy symptoms occur in obese people, but those who are naturally thick-fleshed and blood-abundant do not develop this condition.

Only those who become obese from drinking much alcohol ultimately cannot escape this condition. How does alcohol cause obesity? The Inner Classic states: "Those who drink alcohol have their defensive qi (wei qi) first travel to the skin, first filling the collateral vessels, with the collateral vessels becoming vigorous first. Therefore, when the defensive qi has already become balanced, the nutritive qi (ying qi) then becomes full and the main channels become greatly vigorous." This refers to how alcohol makes human qi and blood flow exclusively outward. When one drinks alcohol and the body becomes hot, it is because qi flows outward. When the face becomes red, it is because blood rushes outward. Each time one drinks and becomes intoxicated, qi and blood flow outward, and when sobering up, though qi and blood are said to return inward again, the qi and blood that have once left their proper locations cannot all return and settle back completely.

This occurs in people whose vital energy is inherently weak. According to Zhu Danxi's theory, what is commonly called evil spirit possession occurs due to a deficiency of qi and blood first. When the spirit has already weakened, it is natural that evil enters. Both blood and qi are deficient. Phlegm blocks the heart and chest, the twelve organs each lose their function, and all seeing, hearing, speech, and movement become false and delusory. If this is treated as evil possession, that person will surely die. Also, according to Xu Donggao's theory, when righteous qi is weak, the mind becomes evil. When the mind is evil, everything seen and heard is nothing but evil. Therefore, evil sees evil. Righteous people without illness cannot see these things at all. Once this mind becomes correct, all hundred evils will avoid it. What evil curse could there be to doubt?

So it is said. Therefore, if one constantly drinks heavily and causes the decline of qi, blood, and vital energy, one might also invite evil curses, so this too should be one thing to be cautious about. However, ancient texts also say that "alcohol can ward off evil qi," so when going to places where evil qi might exist, one should definitely drink alcohol. Alcohol can invigorate a person's spiritual energy. When spiritual energy is vigorous, it can overcome evil qi. However, this refers to drinking at that particular time. It does not mean drinking heavily on a regular basis.

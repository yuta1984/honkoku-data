Alcohol promotes blood heat, making the nutritive blood appear temporarily vigorous, so one sleeps well while intoxicated. However, when the intoxication wears off, sleep also ends. Desiring to sleep well, they drink every night, not knowing that this increasingly multiplies their sleeplessness. One should know that alcohol may provide one night's sleep but in return causes a hundred nights of wakefulness. To treat insomnia, there should be other medicinal treatments besides alcohol. Generally, elderly drinkers think to themselves that they have been drinking since their youth without seeing any harm, so engaging in health preservation now in their declining years would be entirely useless. However, their reaching old age is because they were originally of robust constitution.

Therefore, while there was no harm in their prime years, when they reach old age, as mentioned before, decline gradually increases from ages forty to fifty, so even if there has been no harm until today, tomorrow may bring great harm - this is incalculable. Now, thinking that health preservation is useless in old age is foolish. Human lifespan is given by Heaven, so one should carefully preserve it for however many years, which would accord with the heavenly principle. Moreover, in human morality, longevity is especially revered - the Five Blessings in the "Hongfan" chapter of the Book of Documents places longevity first, and Mencius's Three Venerable Achievements also specifically emphasizes age. Besides these, the politics of respecting age and nourishing the elderly have many precedents since ancient times.

Wine is something that cannot be absent for even a single day between heaven and earth. Some might think that the practice of using wine exclusively in ancestral rites to honor ancestors is only a matter of China and foreign countries, not something of our own country.

so why should wine not be used when worshipping the ancestors of people of lower status today? This is simply because people have become accustomed to seeing Buddhist memorial services and posthumous offerings that do not use wine, and have come to believe that wine should not be offered to the dead. However, since Buddhism prohibits wine even during one's lifetime, it is reasonable that it would not be used after death either. People of today's world encourage their fathers and ancestors to drink wine while they are alive, then suddenly discontinue this after their death. If we observe the use of wine during life, this is not Buddhist teaching. If we observe the prohibition of wine after death, this is not Confucian teaching either. Confucianism deals only with the way of life, while Buddhism alone concerns itself with the law after death.

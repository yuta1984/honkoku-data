The pathway for food is called the throat tube (inkwan). This throat tube loses the moisture of blood, causing it to wither, dry up, and contract, becoming narrow so that the opening of the tube becomes blocked and cannot allow food and drink to pass through. Now, various factors can dry up the nutritive blood of the entire body and cause the blood fluid of the throat tube to dry up, resulting in this condition, but this is primarily caused by alcohol. Why is this so? Because if there are ten people who develop this condition, nine of them are all heavy drinkers. Those who drink heavily and become extremely thin often develop this condition, but those who are fat do not develop this condition. Originally, those with abundant blood who drink heavily become extremely fat. This does not increase blood but sends internal blood outward.
Therefore, the interior becomes deficient and develops symptoms of apoplexy. Originally, those with little blood who drink heavily become extremely

When alcohol enters the middle burner, it necessarily seeks its own kind, so it first goes to the blood aspect. Generally, the bodies and faces of those who drink alcohol are all red. This is the evidence. Blood belongs to yin and has a gentle nature, while alcohol belongs to yang and has fierce qi. Blood tries to remain calm, but alcohol agitates it; blood tries to remain hidden, but alcohol disturbs it. Blood cannot circulate without qi. Therefore, when blood becomes disordered, qi also becomes disordered, and when qi disperses, blood also disperses. Once disturbance occurs, there has never been a case where blood and qi do not become well depleted and damaged. When one is in their youth

Sugar: Neither Japan nor China had sugar in ancient times. In China, it first came as tribute from foreign countries during the Tang dynasty. In Japan, only imported products were treasured until recent times. During the Kyōhō era, sugarcane was introduced from Satsuma via Ryukyu, but the refining methods were still incomplete. Later, around the Hōreki era, the techniques gradually became refined, and now domestic production has surpassed imports. An overview of sugar types includes: sugarcane, sugar syrup, refined white sugar, medium-grade white sugar, black molasses, brown sugar, rock sugar, hard candy, konpeitō (star-shaped candy), caramel candy, and candied preserves.

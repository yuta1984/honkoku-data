Our country also introduced tea seeds from the Song dynasty during the Kamakura period, and from then until now, tea has become increasingly popular in society. The varieties of tea and tea ceremony are well known to people, so there is no need to elaborate. Its properties are bitter-sweet and slightly cold, with no toxicity. It cures scrofulous sores, removes phlegm-heat, stops thirst, reduces sleepiness while providing energy, gladdens the heart, aids digestion, breaks fever, eliminates miasmatic qi (epidemic diseases), promotes urination and defecation, and clears the head and eyes. It treats apoplexy with persistent unconsciousness and eliminates heat stroke. When brewed strong, it expels wind-heat phlegm and saliva. Excessive consumption reduces body fat, causes weight loss, and prevents sleep. It should be drunk hot; drinking it cold accumulates phlegm.

For tea poisoning, use sugar, pickled plum, and licorice. If the abdomen swells, drinking vinegar is good. Ginger tea is good for dysentery. Salt tea, used to rinse the mouth after drinking and eating or morning and evening, removes heat and strengthens teeth. Toothpicks are unnecessary, as any food particles stuck between teeth will shrink and come out. It is also good for washing the eyes. However, drinking salt tea should be prohibited.

Tobacco: In Japan, during the Tenshō and Keichō eras (some say during the Genki years, others say Keichō 10), Nanban merchants brought these seeds. In China, Westerners (Dutch) first introduced it at the end of the Ming dynasty. According to Western accounts, this plant originally comes from an island called "Tobacco" in the American continent.

The writings of ancient sages fill the rafters and make oxen sweat from their weight, yet there are still those who have never come to understand them. Recently, there have been works offering guidance for households with illness that are well-versed in circumstances and excellent in encouraging good and punishing evil, but even these cannot necessarily be called thorough and careful instruction.

Here, Iwana-shi has published "Lessons for the Sick Household" and has requested that I write a preface. When I read it, I can say that its purpose is truly earnest. Written in common language, it develops various theories comprehensively, broadly conveying the author's own views while not forcibly creating wild and empty arguments. Whether treatise or verse, all has been obtained through divine inspiration from the past, and is not an attempt to deceive people by willfully asserting correctness and manipulating words. This work is divided into nine sections and compiled into one volume.

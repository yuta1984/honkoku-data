Being flustered is like making rope after seeing a thief.
Now, if one intends to choose a doctor by oneself, in any case
one should rely on sincere people. Following the customs of today, many
people see those who are clever in worldly matters and think they will be effective in treatment, placing faith in them. This is precisely what it means to treat medical care
carelessly. Sincere people appear awkward in appearance,
so many abandon good doctors and rely on quacks, causing harm.

This happens frequently. Being sincere, kind, and learned is the best
thing. Even without learning, if one is sincere and kind, there should be corresponding
benefits. It certainly does not depend on appearing rough, willful,
or awkward. People who are fixated on such appearances
will inevitably be deceived by those who are skilled at worldly behavior but treat medical care carelessly, and will suffer harm instead.
This is the first principle to understand.

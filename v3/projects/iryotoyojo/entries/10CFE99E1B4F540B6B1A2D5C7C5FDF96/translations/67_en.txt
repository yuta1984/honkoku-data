Plant in areas lower and deeper than flat ground, gradually adding manure and soil. Since they dislike water, spread manure as bedding so it doesn't flow away, and tamp down lightly until the end so as not to compact too much. It's good for manure water to accumulate. Ash manure water and urine are suitable. When they are seedlings, insects like to eat them, so these should be dug out and removed.

Lettuce (Chisa) - The "Nōsō Tsūyaku" (Agricultural Translation Manual) says: First, soak the seeds in water for one day, spread cloth on moist ground, place the seeds on it, and cover them with bowls or dishes. Plant when sprouts emerge. Plant both before the autumn equinox and in the first and second months. The "Honzō" (Materia Medica) says: Plant seeds in the first and second months, good for fertile soil. Purple lettuce is poisonous. The "Getsuryō Kōgi" (Expanded Meaning of Monthly Ordinances) says: Sow seeds in the eighth month, divide and plant in the tenth month, frequently pour liquid manure. There are several varieties of lettuce. Some have long leaves, and purple ones are poisonous so should not be planted. Only [plant varieties with] large leaves that are slow to bolt and slow to bloom

Method for sowing seeds in spring: Choose sunny, fertile, and soft land, selecting areas where there are no other grasses, trees, or vegetables in the vicinity as the place to sow seeds. If there are grasses, trees, or vegetables nearby, insects will appear. From winter onward, mix sandy soil with half paddy field soil or black soil, and add half sandy soil to red soil or black soil, then plow and spread plenty of fertilizer. Also add much dried black mud. Plow two or three times from the New Year, let it dry, spread thin fertilizer on top, dry it, then plow again to make the soil fine and soft before sowing seeds. If you sow seeds in shade, poor soil, hard soil, or without sufficient plowing, seedlings will have difficulty sprouting, and even if they do sprout, they will grow with difficulty and very slowly.

Fine seeds should be mixed with sandy soil or ash fertilizer before sowing. Otherwise they will become too moist and the seedlings will not grow. Generally, when sowing seeds, it is best to sow them thinly.

Generally, there are two types of vegetable cultivation: ridge planting (kei-shu) and broadcast planting (man-shu). Ridge planting is row planting. Broadcast planting is planting without rows, scattering seeds by hand as one sees fit. First, before planting, plow the land thoroughly several times, level the surface of the ridges, and break up or remove soil clumps to make them fine. For broadcast planting, scatter fertilizer and let it dry, then plow shallowly over it.

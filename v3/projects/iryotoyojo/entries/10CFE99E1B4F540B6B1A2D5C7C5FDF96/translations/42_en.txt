Small thistle (azami) - In the "Compendium of Materia Medica," Su Song says: "In the second month when sprouts grow two or three inches, combine with roots to make vegetables, boil and eat. Very delicious. Has many thorns. Produces flowers in the center. The head is like safflower but blue-purple in color." Zong Shi says: "Large thistle (oni-azami) leaves are wrinkled, small thistle leaves are not wrinkled. This is the difference between them." When leaves are young, boil and eat as dressed dishes. Good taste. Nature is also good. Even if you stick the stem in shade it will take root. Large thistle is called oni-azami; eat the leaves when young. Both large and small have good nature.

If this is not done, insects will appear.

The "Nōsei Zensho" (Complete Agricultural Administration) states: "Generally, for vegetable seeds that are difficult to germinate, all should be soaked in water to make them sprout. If done this way, there will be no failure to germinate." Upon reflection, spinach, carrots and such should first be soaked in water before planting. In summer, they should not be soaked for a long time. For hard seeds like peony, lotus seeds, iris, and canna lily - though some may not germinate due to their hardness - if the seeds are sown directly in the ground when ripe, they will surely sprout the following spring. If the seeds are harvested and stored for planting the next spring, they become difficult to germinate.

One theory states: "Generally, when planting seeds, it is good to first warm them by keeping them against human skin for a long time, or have a mother hen warm them in the same way as hatching eggs."

Planting the same vegetables this year in land where they were grown last year is commonly called "iya-chi" (incompatible soil). Chinese texts call this "ji-di" (taboo land). Summer vegetables dislike such incompatible soil. Eggplant, cowpea, bottle gourd, sword bean, pumpkin, winter melon, pickling melon, sweet melon, oriental melon, tobacco - all are like this. If you plant the same crops in the same land as last year, they will not thrive. You must consider this and plant them in other land. If the garden is small and you must plant the same crops in the same location, use soil from elsewhere and change the soil before planting.

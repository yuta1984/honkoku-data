plant in and harvest the roots in May of the following year. Shizhen said, "Plant the roots in the 8th month, divide them in the 1st month and plant in fertile soil, then harvest the roots in the 5th month."

Gai (Chinese onion), also called kyōshi, commonly known as rakkyō, is probably from the characters for "spicy onion" (rakkyō). The roots are eaten with vinegar miso, or boiled and eaten. They may be pickled in sake lees, or soaked for about 20-30 days in a mixture of 1 gō of vinegar and 2 gō of soy sauce before eating. All methods are good. According to herbal texts, the nature of Chinese onion is good, but it states "do not eat young ones that grow in the 3rd and 4th months."

Perilla (Shiso) - The Complete Book of Agricultural Administration states: "Sow seeds in the 2nd and 3rd months. Sometimes old roots remain in the ground and grow naturally." It also states: "When planted in fertile soil, both front and back of leaves become purple; those growing in poor soil have purple backs and green fronts." The Household Essentials states: "Thoroughly plow fertile soil as when planting grains. Should be sown in early 2nd month. Not suitable for shady places. Should cultivate and plant in rich, soft soil. Leaves should be harvested early, before and after the rainy season. The nature is good. If exposed to prolonged drought, the leaf color changes and the nature becomes poor. Select and harvest those with purple on both sides of leaves, remove insects, wash and dry in the sun for half a day, then hang-dry in shade. Overlapping leaves should be separated, or they will rot." Korean perilla has purple on both sides of the leaves. Both taste and nature are good. When perilla is about to grow tall, pinch off the tips. Branches will emerge from the sides and produce more leaves. It dislikes manure.

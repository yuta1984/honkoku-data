Cover thickly with soil. If there are weeds, dig them out. Also, scatter seeds in the eighth month, then in the ninth month prepare the ridges and plant them divided. Frequently pour liquid manure on them. The Honzō Shizhen states that white mustard is planted in the eighth and ninth months. It most fears strong winds. In heavy snow, one should carefully protect it. ○ In winter, covering should be provided. Otherwise, the leaves will wither from wind and cold. ○ The Getsurei Kōgi states that mustard greens should be planted during masshu (end of summer heat). Masshu is the first kanoe day after entering the seventh month season. ○ White mustard seed is used in medicine. The seeds are extremely pungent, and the leaves are large with good flavor, surpassing other mustards. Generally, mustard should be sown a little later than daikon radish. Alternatively, when the seedlings grow long, they should be transplanted in the twelfth month. There is something called bashō-garashi (plantain mustard). Its leaves are broad. There is something called irana. The leaves have cuts and notches on both sides. It is a type of mustard. It is eaten as greens and surpasses ordinary mustard.

The Honzō Shizhen states: "The leaves of flower mustard have many notches, like daikon pods." This would be the irana. Generally, mustard has good flavor as pickles. However, its nature is not good. There is one variety with many seeds and few leaves, called mi-garashi (seed mustard). There is shun-furō (spring everlasting). Its leaves are large and age slowly. This is considered the best.

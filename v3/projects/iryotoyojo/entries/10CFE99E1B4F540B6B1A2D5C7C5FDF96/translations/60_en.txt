suitable for the land. It fears drought. It also states: "Generally, the five grains depend entirely on weather for both abundant and poor harvests, but taro depends on human effort. If cultivation is done skillfully and at the proper time, profits can be obtained. Through this, one can survive bad years, rescue from famine, and supplement insufficient grain food." It also states: "If the area around the roots is kept loose, the taro tubers will be large." The "Getsurei Kōgi" states: "When the morning dew has not yet dried, or after rain, if you weed and mound soil to keep the area around the roots loose, the taro will grow large and produce many tubers. If cultivated with ash manure, it will flourish." The "Kyoka Hitsuyō" states: "Generally, all taro should be made into dried goods. Also, they can be stored and eaten even into summer." This refers to the stems. For roots that contain poison, boil them in lye water. The "Honzō" states: "Like ginger, if boiled, the water changed, and boiled again, the taste is good and there is no poison. Also, steam and eat them, and if cooked together with fish, it is beneficial. Wild taro is highly poisonous and kills people. Even if planted in fields, if not harvested for three years, it becomes wild taro. Those growing by waterside are also wild taro and must not be eaten." It also says: "Taro supplements the center and benefits qi." Some say: "Dig deep furrows to plant taro, gradually sprinkle mustard on the soil, and cover with earth. Cover with soil two or three times." ○ There are also many varieties of taro. Common taro has vine tubers. There is blue taro and black taro. Blue taro has the best taste. Black taro has stems that are slightly black. All prefer wet ground and fear cold weather. In winter, they should be dug up and stored in pits with good covering. Otherwise, they will be damaged by cold and rot. Even one day of exposure to cold wind will harm them.

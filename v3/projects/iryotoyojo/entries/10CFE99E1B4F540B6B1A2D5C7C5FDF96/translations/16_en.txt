Land where crops have been planted becomes hard and insects have not yet developed. It is good to plow virgin soil well. Spread mature manure on the land beforehand, and when planting, mix the seeds with ash and manure before sowing. After sowing, thin out dense areas and plant sparsely. Dense planting is not good. If planted sparsely, the roots become large and taste good. There should be two or three plants per square shaku of land.

○The "Extensive Commentary on Monthly Ordinances" says that rich soil or sandy soil is good. If you cultivate soil while it bears dew, insects will develop.

○"Essential Household Knowledge" says that if you plant last year's old seeds after Rikka (beginning of summer) in well-cultivated land prepared in advance, the roots will grow large in May. Sow successively to obtain seedlings.

○When planting daikon radish, prepare eel bones or heads in advance, char them black, and mix them with the daikon seeds before planting - this prevents insects from eating them. The same applies when planting Chinese cabbage or turnips. Cultivate the land deeply and thoroughly in advance, spread manure, dry the land well in the sun, then sow the seeds. Done this way, the roots will grow large even with little manure. If planted in June, they grow quickly with less insect damage, and the roots become large. Do not go past early July at the latest. If too late, there will be many insects, poor growth, and small roots. Remove harmful insects daily. Boil the leaves of a tree called "yoshimi-shiba" and sprinkle the decoction

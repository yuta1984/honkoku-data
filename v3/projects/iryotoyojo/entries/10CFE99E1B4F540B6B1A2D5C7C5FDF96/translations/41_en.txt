pour it, and after it sprouts and you just water it, after it grows tall, if you pour manure water it will flourish." The "Agricultural and Mulberry Collection of Essentials" says: "Making ridges and planting seeds is like the method for planting radishes. Plant also in the first and second months. Plant twenty days after the autumn equinox and cultivate with dried horse manure. Pour water in the tenth month." The "Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration" says: "In spring months when flower stalks emerge, take them, pour boiling water over them and dry in the sun to eat when there are no vegetables during spring and summer." Shizhen says: "Spinach sown in the eighth and ninth months can provide for winter food, and that sown in the first and second months can provide for spring vegetables. In the sixth month, plow the ground two or three times, spread manure and let it dry, then plow again. In early seventh month, soak the seeds in water, and when they swell, mix with manure ash and sow on the ridges. After they grow, pour manure water and thin out the dense growth. In spring months, break off those that produce stems. Then new leaves will grow again from behind. To collect seeds, do not break the stems. Also do not take too many leaves. There are also flowering stems - these are seedless so break them off." One theory says "if sown in the early or middle ten-day periods they won't grow, so sow in the late ten-day period," but this theory is wrong.

Swiss chard (fudan-so) - Other names are sweet beet, zhen cai. The "Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration" says: "Sow seeds in the second month and transplant in the fourth month. Also sow in the eighth month and divide and plant in the tenth month. Pour manure water frequently." Shizhen says: "Old roots also grow. If sown continuously every month, you will always have them. Therefore it is commonly called 'fudan-so' (continuous vegetable)." It is easier to cultivate than spinach and easier to grow.

The soil should always be kept moist. When planting, the roots should be firmly packed. Liquid fertilizer should be poured frequently. If a little sulfur is added above the roots, the fruit will become large and sweet. If twenty eggplant plants can be grown with proper fertilization, they will provide enough food for one person.

The "Cultivation Manual" states: When eggplants bloom, if you take the leaves, spread them on the path, surround them with charcoal and tie them together, the fruit production will double. ○ There are several varieties of eggplant, and one should select seeds of good quality. Round eggplants are the best, being firm and flavorful. Long eggplants are inferior, being soft and not firm, with poor taste. There are also very long varieties, white eggplants, and some that bear seven to eight fruits per cluster.

When harvesting eggplant fruits, use them whole or cut them in half and hang them above the stove, or bury them in soil. For sowing seeds in seedbeds, prepare a sunny, suitable location from November by raising the ground slightly and laying down plenty of fertilizer, with soil placed around it. The fertilizer should not be washed away by rain. After drying, when sowing seeds in February, mix in rich soil, sow seeds sparsely, and after seedlings emerge, thin out the overcrowded ones. Doing this will make the seedlings grow large and tall easily. Insects will not eat them. ○ Add clay soil to sandy ground, add black sand to clay soil, scatter fertilizer on top, expose to sun, and cultivate again. Do this several times, or add river mud or black mud from ditches, which is even better. Sow seeds when the soil has been well cultivated and softened. If the ground is hard, growth will be difficult. The place where eggplant seeds are sown should have no grass or trees in the surrounding area.

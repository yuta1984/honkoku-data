roots grow. Perennial roots should be covered with soil in the 10th month, as seen in the "Getsuryō Kōgi" (Expanded Meaning of Monthly Ordinances). There is also something called "inondo" in foreign language, which is similar to fennel but different. It grows from seeds sown annually. In winter, the roots die and do not grow from perennial roots.

Wasabi (Japanese horseradish) - Among pungent things, its taste is the best. In the "Jun Wamyōshō" (Japanese Names Dictionary), the characters for mountain aoi and mountain ginger are read as "wasabi." However, I have not yet seen the Chinese name in other books. It is suitable for cold regions on high mountains. It is not suitable for villages on plains. The method for making artificial wasabi when wasabi is not available is to grind mustard and add ginger.

Red pepper (Tōgarashi) - In recent times, it came from Korea. Therefore, it is called Korean pepper. Its forms vary in size and length - some are pointed, some are round, some point upward, and some hang downward. It is suitable for fertile soil. Seeds should be planted in one place, and after seedlings grow, they should be transplanted. Some enthusiasts plant them in pots for ornamental viewing. The well-dried fruits are ground into fine powder and stored, then used in food like pepper and Japanese pepper powder. Li Shizhen's annotation in "Shiwu Bencao" (Food Materia Medica) says "non-toxic, eliminates indigestion, and opens the stomach."

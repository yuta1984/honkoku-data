is also good. It grows well both under trees and in sunny locations. The "Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration" states that it should be planted in spring in places near shaded areas of the garden. In summer, wheat bran is used as fertilizer. Moist soil is preferable. Harvest in autumn. It is also suitable for sunny, fertile land. It can be eaten both raw and cooked. It can be preserved in honey or pickled in soy sauce to make fermented beans (shi).

Konjac (Konnyaku) It grows well even when planted in shade or under trees. It can be propagated by hollowing out the part of the root where buds form and planting it. The remaining root portion can be used. Method for making white konjac: Wash the roots and boil them in hot water. When cooked, test by piercing with a straw - when it goes through easily, place in lukewarm water and remove the outer skin by hand. While still warm, quickly pound well in a mortar. Then add about one sho of lukewarm water to nine sho of roots and mix well by pounding. Mix about four to five spoonfuls of lye in one bowl of hot water and pour over the pounded roots. Mix quickly by hand, press flat on a board, place in containers, and shape into flat konjac forms. Cut when cooled and solidified. If you mix lukewarmly when adding lye, the solidification will be poor. If you want to make the konjac firm, use less water; if you want it soft, use more water. The method for black konjac is different. Clam shell powder can be used instead of lye.

Sweet Potato (Sho) This was introduced from the Ryukyu Islands in recent years. This is also a type of sweet potato (bansho). The root shape resembles that of trichosanthes root, and it is a vine plant. It can be eaten both boiled and steamed. The taste is extremely delicious and its properties are good. It also helps during famines and is used in years of poor harvest. It should be steamed, dried, and stored as powder. It grows in warm regions but rots in cold soil. It can be cultivated even in stony ground and barren soil, and proliferates very well. It is recorded in herbal medicine books. Reading it as "tsukuneimo" is incorrect. In winter, it should be stored in warm places.

Chorogi (Chaurogi) Also called "grass silkworm" (souseki-san). This is what is commonly called "chiyuroki." Its leaves resemble perilla leaves, are wrinkled, and have a few fine hairs. The stem is square-shaped, with roots growing from each node, and many silkworm-like objects grow on the roots. Their color is white and beautiful. In winter and spring, these roots are harvested for use as vegetables and confections. When adding to dressed dishes or clear soups, they should not be overcooked. They are also good pickled in miso. When boiled and eaten, they help relieve famine. The taste is sweet and delicious. Since they proliferate very well, common households should plant these to help during famines. They are recorded in the vegetable section of the Bencao Gangmu (Compendium of Materia Medica), the Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration, and the Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Three Realms. However, the Bencao Gangmu treats chorogi and diguaer as the same plant, while the Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration and the Illustrated Encyclopedia state that diguaer resembles chorogi but is longer. Each shows separate illustrations. In shaded land

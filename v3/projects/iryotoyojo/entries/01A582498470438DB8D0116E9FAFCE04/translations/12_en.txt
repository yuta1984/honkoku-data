Daylily　Both shoots and flowers have a cool nature and are non-toxic; roots are the same. In the "Rescue from Famine Materia Medica," it is named
　common river grass. In the "Materia Medica," it has the alternative name deer onion, and those growing in mountains and fields are called "suitable for men." The "Fudoki" (regional chronicles) states that preg-
　nant women who wear its flowers will bear male children, hence the name. 《Note: Writing it as "sennan" in one text is incorrect》 To rescue from famine, take young shoots and leaves,
　boil and soak in water, wash thoroughly, and season with salt and soy sauce to eat. Master Genko says that flowers, leaves, and
　buds are all good vegetables. They are not only for rescuing from famine but can also be made into powder, like the
　method for processing bracken. In recent years with frequent famines, many mountain people have relied on this. Like extracting bracken powder,
　they make it into rice cakes for provisions, and the taste is said to be good.
Wild hollyhock (water dropwort)　Even sick people need not avoid it. It is a fine variety among vegetables. Leaves and roots should also be boiled for provisions.

The Overly Polite Drinker

The overly polite drinker represents one type of drinking behavior. As the saying goes, "excess is as bad as deficiency" - while slightly better than quarrelsome drinkers or angry drinkers, when drunk, their politeness becomes completely foolish politeness that greatly troubles others. As they become more intoxicated, they abandon proper sitting posture, and with their slurred tongue, they drone on and on with excessive politeness, much like drawing out a medicinal rehmannia decoction at great length. They forget about their own half-finished cup in front of them, causing boredom among the drinking companions, and every time they pick up food with chopsticks they lift them ceremoniously, not hearing a word of others' conversations. The other guests mostly pretend to go along with it, but eventually turn to their own frivolous conversations.

Though no one pays attention to this excessive politeness, the drunk person doesn't mind due to the alcohol's effects. Even when serving sake, they're so intoxicated they end up making incomprehensible polite speeches to the ground itself. While one feels truly sorry watching this, since everyone has their own inescapable drinking habits, it's more endearing than a teetotaler's foolish attempts at politeness.

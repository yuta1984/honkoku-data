The Argumentative Drinker

Argumentative drinkers are numerous in this world. There are several types of arguments - some engage in forced logic like "If that water you spilled were oil, and if this were the twelfth month, what would you do then?" Others, carried away by drink, preach about filial piety and advocate loyalty. Those of lower character, according to their behavior, turn to vulgar topics, saying things like "I tried to woo the girl across the way but failed - that person's soul has been switched!" In any case, they make arguments that irritate people's hearts. Therefore, even when they occasionally make valid points, since it's all considered drunken rambling, absolutely no one pays them any heed.

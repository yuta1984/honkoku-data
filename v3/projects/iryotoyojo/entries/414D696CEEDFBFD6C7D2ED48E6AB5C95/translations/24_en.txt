Hangover

There is nothing in this world as peculiar (painful) as the stomach condition of a hangover. One desires food but cannot eat it, and if one forces oneself to eat, one will surely vomit. First, the usual morning bath, then before noon, it is good to drink a little hot sake diluted with hot water. Drinking hot broth is also good. Also, making a decoction of dried persimmons and using it is good. Eating soft-shelled turtle is also good. Applying moxa to the Sanri acupuncture point is also good. Having a skilled practitioner perform abdominal massage with dōin exercises also feels pleasant.

Things that are bad when hungover are: eating rice, writing, sleeping, sexual intercourse, eating pears, drinking salted tea, warming oneself by the kotatsu. All of these things are entirely bad.

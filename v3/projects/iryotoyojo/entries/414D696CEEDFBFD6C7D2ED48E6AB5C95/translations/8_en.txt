The Rambling Drinker

Is "kuda" (rambling) so named because one speaks tediously about things, or is it named after how women wind thread around a spool - repeating the same action patiently over and over again? In any case, there is no drinker who doesn't ramble when drunk.

Those who say "I'm not drunk" are invariably intoxicated. Saying "I don't ramble" is itself rambling. According to one person's account: "When I get drunk, both what I say and what I do become tedious. Last night too, I got drunk for the first time in a while and tried to woo a courtesan, but whether it was that night or another night, all I ended up doing was being unreasonable."

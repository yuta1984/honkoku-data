The Violent Drinker

Violence is the way of ruffians and is most fearsome. Carried away by drunkenness, they brandish swords and fight with others, raise their fists to beat each other, sometimes suffering wounds or losing their lives. The existence of such drinkers needlessly sullies the name of alcohol.

Originally, alcohol is the chief of all medicines - it makes one forget sorrows, lessens anxiety, and promotes longevity. Even sages have said "Though there is no set measure, one should not reach the point of disorder," and both Japan and China have honored and used it for ages.

To bring disgrace upon such noble and virtuous alcohol by indulging one's rough temperament makes one truly a criminal against sake. Those who love alcohol should cultivate refinement in their hearts and exercise restraint, never engaging in drunken and mad behavior.

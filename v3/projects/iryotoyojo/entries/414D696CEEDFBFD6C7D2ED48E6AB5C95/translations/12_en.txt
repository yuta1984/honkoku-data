The Magnanimous Drinker

I have an acquaintance who is a heavy drinker. This person is extremely poor and has never been able to get through month-end comfortably. On the twenty-ninth day of a certain month, his wife went to her parents' home and borrowed about ten items including clothing and household goods, gave them to her husband to use as collateral, and had him arrange for money. The husband agreed and went to the pawnshop, obtained two shu in gold, and on his way home met some drinking companions and shared sake at a teahouse. This person got drunk and disorderly, took out those two shu, distributed the money among the geisha and jesters, leaving only one piece of nanryo silver, and passed out drunk right there. The next morning, though he regretted it a thousand times, it was too late. Wondering what use this one piece of two shu could serve, he prepared two servings of Nishikide tea-over-rice bowls, returned home, gave one for his wife's use and made one his own vessel. This should be called a magnanimous drinker.

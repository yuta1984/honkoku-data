The Summoning Drinker

So last night I got terribly drunk. After parting with you midway, I stopped by the mistress's house of that fellow who was in high spirits from drinking, forcibly coaxed him out, and we drank until after midnight. Then I wandered over to the evening cool at Nabeshima Beach, where I was drinking alone some smelly loach soup when someone called me from a stall behind me. When I turned around, I saw the neighbor's son had come to enjoy the evening cool with a guest from Kyoto, so I forcibly dragged them along to Kita Shinchi, where we drank heavily at Hanazen. Both of us bought courtesans and fell asleep.

When we said we should head home, they made a fuss about taking palanquins, but I said that while being drunk is enjoyable, riding in a palanquin wouldn't be fun, so I walked home unsteadily. On the way, I forced my way onto Torakyu's boat just as they were closing up, had another drink of eel, had them wrap up the remaining eel from the serving bowl, tucked it in my kimono, and went home. To flatter my wife, I showed her the eel, and with pickled eggplant and pickled ginger, I had fifteen or sixteen cups from a small sake cup. Then my wife snatched the cup away and glared at me, wanting me to have another drinking session, and the frightening look sobered me right up. Wanting to have another drink in bed, I asked what time it was, and when they said it was now striking six in the morning, even I was shocked.

Pushy people often end up in this sorry state.

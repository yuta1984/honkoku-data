The Bragging Drinker

Bragging drinkers are numerous in this world.

During the continued rainy season when things are damp and gloomy, when his courtesan companion gives uninteresting replies, he becomes sullen, and while the geishas and entertainers fail to enliven the gathering, a clever serving woman sees through his bluffing. With just a light touch he tumbles over, and with the slightest bump he falls right down.

"My hands and body are numb. How were you born with such great strength?"
The entertainer, understanding this transparent trick, agrees: "Master, you are the strongest!" and pulls out a pillow for him to sit on. "If we were to wrestle, my whole body would be crushed!"
The geishas also play along: "Just pulling fingers to the limit makes my fingers hurt," as everyone works together to build him up.

Hōgwan (the customer's name) greatly improves his mood, and then begins his boastful bragging: "More tremendous than when Watōnai attacked in that great battle - such fierce gunfire hits! In the dark of night, one can say whatever one pleases."

Indeed, he is an easy and profitable customer to handle.

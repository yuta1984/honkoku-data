The Angry Drinker

The angry drinker represents a bad habit with alcohol. Those who enjoy drinking should make every effort to exercise restraint and correct this tendency. First, it begins with using drunkenness as an excuse to rage excessively over trivial matters, grabbing plates and bowls within reach to throw and smash to pieces.

Even when there's just a slight annoyance, whether it's food bowls of fine akae old imported porcelain or complete five-piece sets of Sōtetsu-style soup bowls, no matter how valuable, they push them aside and smash Hagi-ware tea drinking bowls to vent their anger. Gradually this habit intensifies, and eventually just drinking alcohol makes anger seem natural.

Even when entertaining precious guests, they will berate their wives over the seasoning of the soup, and when displeased that the maid Komerō served sake while yawning, they slap her across the face. This shows disrespect to guests and poor household management - utterly dampening the mood. However, this tendency doesn't escalate to the serious level of fighting people or wielding swords.

Even when hurling insults or making offensive remarks at others, if the other party pushes back more forcefully, they immediately bow deeply and apologize. This is fundamentally because their hearts harbor calculations of profit and loss. Teetotalers call this "bad drinking."

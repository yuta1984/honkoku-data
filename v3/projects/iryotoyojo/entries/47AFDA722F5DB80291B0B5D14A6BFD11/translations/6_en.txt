The mouth of the five body parts is quite capable. One day, he was assigned the role of messenger to a noble. While he should have gone on horseback, he said that his way of traveling is as swift as water flowing down a smooth board, so he would go on foot, and immediately set out. It happened to be during continuous long rains, and the road was muddy and impassable, but he forced himself to hurry along. Because he rushed too much, at the edge of a steep stone pavement, his mouth slipped and he fell headfirst. Unable to deliver his master's message or do anything, he was greatly embarrassed. The person who came out to receive him also felt sorry for him.

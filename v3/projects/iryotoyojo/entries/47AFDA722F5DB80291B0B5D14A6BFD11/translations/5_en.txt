Dōmyōji sweets, and such. When they see the mouth being demanding, they bring even more.

When people see bad things about others, they immediately want to talk about it. To avoid getting a bad reputation, they try to seal mouths with money bribes, saying they absolutely won't tell, but since they might accidentally let it slip, and since "you can't put a door on a person's mouth," here they try to install a sliding door, pulling it up and hooking the jaw latch.

"During the hottest summer days, watermelons don't crack. Ask me why. Not eating watermelon is during the hot season."

"Please make it so it blows out while alive"

"We offer Dōmyōji sweets to the divine statue"

"Since we offered myōga ginger and perilla to the kitchen, Master Sanbu has a mouth as light as his social position. We prepared them all together. We made this combining myōga waist-tightener with Dōmyōji sweets."

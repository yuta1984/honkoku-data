　　　Verification of Utensils

There was an old man here. When people spoke the names of various utensils, he could memorize them well after hearing them just once. Those utensils were:
　Hand towel, Brazier, Felt mat, Inkstone box
　Koto (zither), Folding fan, Document box, Mirror
　Pot, Tea bowl

These ten types in total. When asked how he memorized them, he answered:
For the first, the crown of the head, he likened placing a hand towel there; for the second, the forehead, he likened the fire of a brazier;

For the third, the eyes, he likened a felt mat that shows things to the eyes;
For the fourth, the nose, he likened nasal mucus to an inkstone; for the fifth, the mouth, 
he likened the koto of words; for the sixth, the throat, once it passes through the throat, the end is
wide, he said; for the seventh, the breast, a document box has tassels, like
breasts; for the eighth, the chest, he likened it to a mirror of the chest;
For the ninth, the belly, a pot full of food makes the belly swell; 
For the tenth, he likened the navel to boiling tea.

is of course inescapable in the afterlife as well. "Know the afterlife by observing this world" means precisely this.
Therefore, my method of divination is as follows:
Physiognomy readings are conducted only until the fifth hour of the morning on clear days, limited to one person per day. Considerations of divine physiognomy, Buddhist physiognomy, sword physiognomy, seal physiognomy, and mirror physiognomy are done until the hour of the horse on clear days. The I Ching divination can be performed day or night, having the person cast three times, and I deliberate and convey the results. For ink divination (written fortune results), if brought today, it will be ready tomorrow morning. The proper way to write it is: age in tens, childhood name, then what, now what, and record wishes and desires, other new thoughts, marital compatibility, marriage arrangements, directions, presence or absence of child connections. All matters including construction, moving residences, repairs, buying and selling, pawning transactions, and real estate are handled the same way.
In general, for matters regarding hiring servants - directions, truth or falsehood, presence or absence as well as compatibility, other complicated matters, entangled situations, all fortune, investigation of one's true heart, seven calamities and eight sufferings, good and bad fortune in all affairs - whatever the matter, if you record in detail the various things you wish to clarify and visit me,

Furthermore, I distribute a charitable book called "Record of Food Effects and Poisons for Disease Prevention and Life Extension," organized in syllabary order for easy reading. I give one copy to each person.
Now, for land divination, measuring east-west how many ken, north-south how many ken, using a scale of one sun per ken, I draw a diagram of the land, roughly in the center, following the magnetic needle to record directions. Then examining the elevation of the land, water flow, whether new land is to be developed, or if there are desires for residential land, I examine in detail prosperity and decline, impurities, and things buried in the ground. I can definitively state what lies how far below. If the condition of the land is recorded in detail, everything can be understood. At that time, taking the center of the land as the central point, all matters...

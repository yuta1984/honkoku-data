Now, in the world there are lawless people who claim to receive divine messages from Inari, various myōjin (Shinto deities), Myōken, Konpira, Daishi, or Daijingū, and deceive people. Such practices are prohibited by national law, and official notices are frequently issued about this.

This should make things clear. In general, whether one becomes a teacher, is called sensei, or becomes a superior, if all three live in poverty, or if there are hardships in the household, even though they teach others, it is because there are faults in their own conduct. Regarding this, when one stands above others, maintaining proper conduct is truly difficult. Especially for fortune-tellers who consider good and bad luck, furthermore, misinterpretations become the sin of the diviner. Before one's eyes...

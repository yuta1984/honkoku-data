Such indecisive doctors who "catch neither flies nor wasps" should not have their medicines taken.

○If after taking medicine from an incompetent doctor, the mouth becomes ulcerated and the teeth loosen, one should understand this to be from mercurous chloride preparations. Mercurous chloride is a highly toxic substance that dries the skin surface, desiccating the blood and making it like a withered tree without moisture. The circulation of body fluids becomes stagnant and emerges only through the mouth, causing suffering from phlegm and cough. In severe cases, one spits saliva and foam day and night, suffering while keeping a spittoon close by.

Body fluids are the moisture of the entire body and are precious substances that transform into vital essence and blood. Therefore, one should not entrust oneself to incompetent doctors and take such harsh medications. If one takes medicine containing mercurous chloride and damages the mouth, causing various other harmful effects, one should decoct dried plums and drink the preparation. Alternatively, adding black beans to it is also good.

○Among incompetent doctors, there is an evil practice called "advance payment" where, regardless of the various diseases, before giving any medicine, they name it "medicine fee" and greedily demand gold and silver.

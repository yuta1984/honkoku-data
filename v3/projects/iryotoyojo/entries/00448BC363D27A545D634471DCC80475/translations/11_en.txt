There are often many cases of complete recovery without taking medicine. Already in remote countryside areas, pregnant women do not tie the fifth-month belt, and there are villages without midwives, yet conversely there are no worries about difficult births. Also, in ancient battlefields, sword wounds were treated without waiting for doctors, with people treating each other. Western people are similar to this. The people of those countries each have knowledge of medical arts, nurture their bodies and provide treatment themselves. They do not carelessly entrust themselves to doctors, it is said. Western matters are recorded at the end.

○The human body is a wondrous and mysterious thing. Within this body there is what is called the stomach, which receives food and drink. People constantly take in food to nurture their vital energy and sustain life—this is the foundation of nourishment. As soon as that food enters the belly, it gradually and quickly putrefies and becomes excrement. Even people who have lost their teeth and swallow without chewing still experience the same putrefaction. The great mechanism of the human body and the principle by which heaven and earth assist people is limitless. Even when all kinds of grains and vegetables are boiled in pots and kettles for several hours, they do not transform as they do into excrement. Though this concerns people's own bellies, no one knows this principle.

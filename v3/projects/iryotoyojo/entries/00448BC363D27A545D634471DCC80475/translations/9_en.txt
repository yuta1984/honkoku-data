If one does not primarily treat food as a source of pleasure, all food and drink become nourishment, leading to a long and healthy life. According to the teachings of a man named Xu Chunfu, most premature deaths from various diseases are caused by food and drink. The harm from food and drink exceeds that of sexual desire. Regardless of high or low social status, those who live in comfort, wear warm clothing, eat delicious food, and have little physical exercise suffer from many illnesses and live short lives. Food and drink are the gate that helps us and the door that kills us. Whether life is long or short does not depend on whether one is strong or weak, but mostly arises from food and drink, so one should deeply exercise caution with food and drink.

○Medical arts are methods for treating illness. They involve considering the times, measuring the nature of the country's land and people's strengths and weaknesses, using things like plant roots and tree bark, and are living methods for curing diseases. Illnesses come in countless varieties with no limits whatsoever. Therefore, it is said that the character for "doctor" (医) comes from "intention" (意), meaning it is an art that achieves results through intention, and is not an easy skill. It is an art that ordinary people find difficult to master. For this reason, when there is a seriously ill patient and several good doctors are invited to inquire about the cause of illness and prescriptions, their opinions vary greatly—the causes they identify are not the same, and their prescriptions differ as much as black and white.

Master Shikitei, as material for his comic fiction, peers into the floating world through his brush handle—not to take a narrow view like looking at the sky through a tube.
Picture tales focus only on what is interesting, with shallow meaning,
painting human emotions in colors more shallow than yellow from the inkstone's sea, manipulating the threads of human feeling.
In the spectacles that view this world, even the Dutch fall silent, and courtesans cry "Oh my, oh my!" as butterflies pair on sleeve screens
in playful spring wakakusa-zōshi tales, with brave hearts at Komagata—
behold this spectacle's design, as I write this preface for my friend's
work.

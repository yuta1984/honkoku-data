　Waka Shokumotsu Honzō, Volume 1
　　　Plant Section (kusa no bu)
Taro (imo) has a spicy taste and neutral nature
　　Beware deeply of the poison in various diseases
Eat taro only in winter, in other months
　　You should not consume it, for illness comes
If you eat taro for a long time, you will become weak
　　Know that your strength will also decline
Taro relaxes the intestines and stomach and moves qi downward
　　It supplements deficiency but damages the blood

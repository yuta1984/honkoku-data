▲Umegae Denbu (Plum Branch Denbu)
In a corner of Kyoto, there was a person named so-and-so who became seriously ill from a slight cold, and could not eat at all. His wife, worried about this, prayed to the gods and Buddha day and night, making vows. Then the local guardian deity appeared in a dream one night, saying, "Due to your sincere devotion, I shall bestow a paper talisman on a plum branch in your garden. If you do as instructed, he will surely regain his appetite and recover quickly from his illness." She rose early in the morning and searched the plum branches.

Indeed, there was a paper talisman. She took it back and opened it to find written: "Finely shred premium Tosa bonito flakes and prepare them well with fine sake and soy sauce, then encourage him to eat." She immediately prepared it as instructed and offered it to him, and within days he recovered completely. From then on, she made this dish, eating it herself and giving it to others. All people found it delicious, and it spread throughout society. The name should remain as is: "Umegae Denbu" (Plum Branch Denbu).

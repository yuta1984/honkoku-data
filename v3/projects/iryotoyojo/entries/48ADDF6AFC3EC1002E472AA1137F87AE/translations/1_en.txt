Preface
Among my acquaintances was an old man who would find fault with people's speech.
When someone said "muzukashii" (difficult), he would say, "This 'ichi' part is what's truly difficult. What about the remaining 'mutsu'?"
When someone said "mendōkusai" (troublesome), he would insist, "I have lived to this age and have never yet smelled the scent of 'mendō.'"
What an impossible old codger he was, always finding seeds to criticize people's words.

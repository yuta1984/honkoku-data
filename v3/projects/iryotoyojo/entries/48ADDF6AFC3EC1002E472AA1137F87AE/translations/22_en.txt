Tsumii-ire [Note: A type of dish. "Picking and putting in" hanpen.] should be "tsumami-ire" (picked and put in).

▲Shunkan
During the hot summer season, a dish served as mukōzuke (side dish) for meals, where bamboo shoots are put in chilled broth, is called "shunkan."
Since the character for bamboo shoot (筍) is read as "shun," and because it is served cold as chilled broth, it becomes "kan" (cold). Therefore, it should be "shunkan."

From Tang China, during the time of Emperor Yūryaku, women named Kureha (Weaver from Wu) and Ayaha (Weaver from Han) came. These were women who wove brocade and various other patterned items in different colors. From then on, this was transmitted to Japan. On September 18th, when they worship these women, they cook various things in broth as offerings and eat them at home as well. The dish consists of various colored threads cut finely and boiled. Therefore, abbreviating "thread scraps," it should be "itokoni."

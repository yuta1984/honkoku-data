1. In the spring of Kyōhō 19 (1734), when epidemic disease was greatly prevalent, among those who received moxibustion treatment at the Kōkō, Fūmon, and Haiyu acupoints (moxibustion points on the shoulders), seven to eight out of ten people avoided the epidemic disease. Or even if they contracted the illness, they did not die.

1. Those who contract epidemic disease initially feel chills throughout the body, heaviness and pain in the head, and general fatigue. As the disease penetrates deeper into the body, the chills and headache cease, but various other sufferings increase, eventually developing into serious illness. Therefore, in the initial stage, one should provide treatment to expel the pathogenic qi outward and prevent it from entering the interior. The method for this is nothing other than inducing sweating. If there are no medicines stored at this time, first cover yourself with nightwear and bedding, and when the whole body becomes warm, add plenty of grated ginger to rice porridge and use it sufficiently to induce sweating. Also, broths with scallions and Chinese chives are good. If sufficient sweating occurs with this, the disease should be cured. Even if complete recovery is not achieved, the disease qi will be weakened by six to seven parts.

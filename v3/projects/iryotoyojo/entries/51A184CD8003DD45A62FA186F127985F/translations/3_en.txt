Kyūmin Yakuhō (Medicinal Remedies for Saving the People)　　　　【Seal】Donated by Fujikawa Yu

It has been said since ancient times that epidemics inevitably break out after years of famine. However, since there are many people in distress in mountain villages and other places where there are no doctors, when epidemics spread after the famine during the Kyōhō era, the government recommended publishing simple medicinal remedies. Later, during the Tenmei famine, it was ordered that these remedies be copied and distributed to all villages.

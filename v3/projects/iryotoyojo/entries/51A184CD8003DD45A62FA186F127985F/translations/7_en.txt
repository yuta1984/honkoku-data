The above is a copy that was ordered to be published by the Town Magistrate's Office and distributed to villages in the shogun's direct territories after the epidemic that followed the famine of Kyōhō 18th year, Year of the Ox.

At present, epidemics are spreading in villages throughout various provinces, and people of lower status are suffering hardships from food poisoning. Since the medicinal prescription documents distributed in the aforementioned Kyōhō 18th year are now quite old and may have been lost in many villages, this copy should now be circulated by the lords and local administrators of villages as a relief measure.

The "Sansai Zue" states: During the Kenyan era of Emperor Ai of Han, men transformed into women. The "Monthly Ordinances" records that sparrows enter the sea and become clams, but perhaps this refers to daughters going to temple exhibitions and becoming brides. It seems that the horn implements (dildos) of the long chambers allow women to transform into men, while the lightly made-up male prostitutes of the uptown areas are men who transform to become like women [Note 1]. This is like comparing a shy son with a tomboyish daughter. Recently I hear that Sukeroku's soul has been exchanged, and reaching into Agemaki's heart, he manipulates the spirits of customers and courtesans, bringing about the fashionable courage of the times through the medicinal power of three measures of moxa and Roko moxa, cutting off the root ailments of connoisseurs (curing diseases of love). Ah, if it weren't for red moxa treatments, this preface to the red book would end here.

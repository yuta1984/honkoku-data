(This matter is repeatedly discussed and debated in later sections.)
The sun and moon create day and night through this, and the national territory is maintained by this. Through the minute pores of humans and animals, plants and trees, metals and stones, and various implements, [qi] flows and penetrates without cease. The formation of their shapes and the performance of their functions all depend entirely on the transportation of this qi—there is nothing that does not rely on it. (Testing this with instruments such as the air-evacuating bell and qi-measuring tubes described in the "Essentials of Health Cultivation" can serve as one proof of the actual existence of this qi.)

The form of all things consists of what is called "ultimate particles" (gokumi). (The term "ultimate particles" appears in Buddhist texts such as the Yogācāra-vijñānavāda and Abhidharmakośa, as well as in heterodox texts like the Sāṃkhyakārikā, meaning the utmost minuteness that cannot be seen with the naked eye.) These minute things gather together

to form their respective shapes. While there are pores through which qi flows, they are difficult to see with the naked eye. To give one example: things like gold and silver are entirely like bundles of needles, with minute pores between them as dense as looking at the holes of a sieve. (If you polish a silver hairpin, remove its oil, apply much mercury to its head, and press it forcefully toward the foot, you can see mercury rolling out from the tip, proving that there are pores through which mercury's ultimate particles can penetrate.) Through the ceaseless flow of this qi between them, the fundamental nature that causes all things to attract and gather together is distributed and spread out, allowing each to fulfill its nature. What distributes this is contained within the qi

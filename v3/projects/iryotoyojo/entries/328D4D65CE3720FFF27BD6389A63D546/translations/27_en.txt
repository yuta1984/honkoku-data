At this place, during seven days each in the second and eighth months, with Makeishura as the leader, the underworld officials gather and record all good and evil deeds. Also, countless millions of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas preach the Dharma during these seven days, bringing joy to sentient beings, dispelling worldly desires, and leading them to the other shore (enlightenment). This name originates from these matters. In spring, it is the eleventh day from the second month's seasonal division; in autumn, it is the fifteenth day from the eighth month's seasonal division. Since the seasonal conditions represent the balanced center of metal energy and are warm, it is named "proper time" as a period for cultivating goodness, and among common people, performing virtuous deeds in secret is considered most important. Also, this is considered a good time for sowing various vegetable seeds.

○About Hassen (Eight Specialties)
Hassen refers to eight days of harmony among twelve days, named "eight specialties" with the meaning of specializing in eight. "Harmony" means cases like the harmony between Mizunoe (water) and Ne (water), meaning the harmonious alignment of the five elements of the stems and branches. Among these, there are four days that do not harmonize, called interval days. For example, Mizunoto (water) and Ushi (earth) - this is earth overcoming water, so they do not harmonize. Among twelve days, eight harmonize, with yin and yang in perfect balance.

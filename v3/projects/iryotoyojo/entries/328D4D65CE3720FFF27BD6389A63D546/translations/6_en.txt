Chop the white roots of scallions, mix with rice and cook into porridge to eat daily. Also boiling mugwort leaves in vinegar to drink is good. Or add ginger and decoct similarly. This is especially good for severe abdominal pain. Another method:
Coptis (10 monme), Aucklandia (1 monme), Evodia (5 monme)
Roast these three ingredients together, powder them, and use 1-2 monme at a time with sake or rice water.
For bloody dysentery that passes blood, combine paper mulberry bark and schizonepeta in equal parts, powder them and use 1 monme with vinegar.

　○Method to avoid dysentery
Take mock strawberry, expose it to morning dew on Boys' Day and swallow one with water. That year, no matter how much dysentery spreads, you won't catch it - this is wonderful.
Also char pomegranate to black ash and drink with water that no one has drawn on May 5th at dawn. You will never suffer from dysentery in your lifetime.

Preface to Essential Discussions on Patient Care
A disciple asked, saying: "There is a man in his thirties.
He is constitutionally weak and emaciated, with withered flesh and dried form. He constantly takes
Hochū-ekki-tō (Center-Supplementing Qi-Boosting Decoction) and Rokumi-gan (Six-Ingredient Pill) to maintain his health and survive.
During intense heat, while sitting on a mat, he ate cold noodles, whereupon his abdomen became cold and painful.
Without vomiting or having diarrhea, he fell into agony. Three doctors were present at the scene.

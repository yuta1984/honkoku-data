If bleeding is difficult to stop after puncturing, use a decoction of peppermint
and knead it with cattail pollen powder, then apply this. Also, administering kanren-tō (licorice and coptis decoction) occasionally
is good. There is also a condition called gakō-sō (thrush). Commonly called "shita-shitogi" 【Note】 also called "aguri."
The mouth and tongue are all white, appearing as if rice flour has been applied. Use kanren-tō as the basic
prescription, and dissolve powdered Arisaema in paste and apply to the soles of the feet.

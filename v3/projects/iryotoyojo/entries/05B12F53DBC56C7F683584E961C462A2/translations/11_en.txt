1. This book is not originally intended for the eyes of learned scholars. It is written solely to enlighten men who are unfamiliar with letters and who are misled by worldly customs. Without regard for the vulgarity of language, I have compiled matters concerning childbirth and child-rearing and named it "Hahakogusa" (Mother and Child Grass). If there are those who agree with me and would explain the purpose of this book and make it heard by women

Therefore, contractions come from within. You must think that the baby will be born without pushing from your side.

○When you truly think real contractions have begun, you should sit on the grass seat. The grass seat refers to the place where one sits during childbirth. If you hurriedly sit in that position before the time has come, the birthing mother's heart will become anxious. Especially when the cold is strong, since the area below the waist becomes cold, the vital energy will increasingly rise upward and take more time. For those who are naturally weak in constitution and whose physical energy is exhausted, it is harmless to give birth while lying down, keeping the pillow slightly elevated and remaining in a lying position.

Four: Things to understand while the placenta has not descended

The placenta should emerge after the child is born, following immediately after, but sometimes it is delayed and comes out after two to three days or even four to five days. In most cases, during delivery, pushing too forcefully exhausts the vital energy and startles the heart, naturally pushing it upward. The common people mistakenly think that if the placenta does not descend immediately, it will never descend. Therefore, inexperienced people, driven by anxiety, carelessly massage the abdomen and rub the lower back, making the birthing mother worried and causing even more delay. Since it is something that should naturally descend, one should think that it will descend even without the help of others.

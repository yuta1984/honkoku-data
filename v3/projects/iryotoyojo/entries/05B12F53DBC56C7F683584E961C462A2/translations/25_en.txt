Indeed. A certain person's wife became pregnant and reached seven months, but her morning and evening work was busy, and her standing and sitting was more unstable than usual. However, because she overworked her body, her mind became tired and she gradually began to feel the heaviness of her belly. Thinking this was because her sash was loose, she tightened the sash herself, but because this made her feel uncomfortable, wondering what to do, she called a midwife to examine her. The midwife said this was because she had not tightened the sash early and the child was growing large. When she tightened it strongly again, she immediately suffered abdominal pain and dizziness. When I examined her, since there was no other ailment, I loosened her sash, massaged her belly, and had her rest quietly, and she recovered in just a few days. When I first examined her, I carefully explained the harm of tightening the sash, but she still doubted it. Only when she experienced that comfort did she finally believe that my words were not lies. This is generally due to worldly custom, so people do not notice the harm of the sash.

○Around the Shōhō period, I believe. A certain noble lady became pregnant, and she was always very prudent, reading books of sages and keeping her mind righteous, not indulging in sleeping, eating, or daily activities as she pleased. Even though there was a ceremony for putting on the pregnancy sash, in truth she discarded the belly band. When her lady-in-waiting advised her that it would be bad for her health if she did not wear the belly band, she replied: "No, in Chinese books, I have not yet heard of belly bands being mentioned."

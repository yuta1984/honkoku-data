When conditions are good, sores develop where the sash was worn, leaving unexpected
troubles. In general, both before and after birth, one should understand that all will be
peaceful without relying on the help of sashes. Our predecessors
already advocated that belly bands cause harm: in the Tenwa era, Hata Genshun; in the Kyō-
hō era, Gotō Chūsuke; and in the Meiwa era, Kagawa Gen'etsu all wrote books on this,
but since they contain detailed information, I omit them here, and because some are written in Chinese characters
making them less convenient for everyone to understand and read, I have
recorded this again in this manner.
【4】Avoiding bathing after the seventh month of pregnancy

【Left page】
Books such as "Senkin-hō" (Thousand Gold Prescriptions) and "Gedai Hiyō" (Secret Essentials from the Imperial Library) say that one should not bathe
from the seventh month onward. However, among people of recent times, there are those who
prefer to take hip baths every night. Pregnant women who are naturally strong occasionally
do not suffer harm from this, but if they are weak and have poor appetite,
or have diarrhea, or have swelling in their body, when they persistently take hip baths,
although they feel comfortable at the moment, afterward they often
catch cold, which increases the harm. Even on hot summer days,
when one bathes persistently, the pores open and one easily catches
colds. How much more so on cold winter nights when the cold air is strong.

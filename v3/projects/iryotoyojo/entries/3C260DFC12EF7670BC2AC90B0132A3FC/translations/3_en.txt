The Yellow Emperor asked Qibo, saying: "I have heard that the people of ancient times all lived beyond one hundred years of age in spring and autumn, yet their movements and activities did not decline. The people of today reach only fifty years of age, yet their movements and activities all decline. Is this because the times are different, or have people lost something?" Qibo replied: "Among the people of ancient times, those who understood the Way followed the patterns of yin and yang, harmonized with mathematical principles, had moderation in food and drink, maintained regularity in rising and resting, and did not engage in reckless labor. Therefore, they were able to let both body and spirit exist together and live out their natural lifespan to the end. The people of today are not like this. They use wine as if it were water, regard recklessness as normal, exhaust their essence through desires, dissipate their true nature, do not know how to maintain fullness, improperly control their spirit at inappropriate times, focus on pleasing their hearts, and go against the principles of life and pleasure. Therefore, they decline at fifty years of age," and so on.

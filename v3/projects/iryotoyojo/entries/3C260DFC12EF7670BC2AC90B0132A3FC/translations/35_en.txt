1. Precautions Regarding Drinking Alcohol
　Generally, the nature of alcohol is hot, tends to cause flushing, disperses qi, and prevents wind-cold and mist-dew qi. If used excessively and for long periods, it corrupts the intestines, heats the stomach, depletes the marrow, weakens the tendons, injures the spirit, and shortens life. The "Suwen" states: "When alcohol qi is abundant and violent, kidney qi declines daily," etc. People who habitually drink excessively have deficient meridians, lack strength in their hands and feet, and suffer from declining kidney qi.

○The reason immortals do not prohibit alcohol is because it circulates qi. However, it should not be used excessively.

○Do not drink alcohol during the hour of the Rabbit (5-7 AM).

○Do not lie down immediately after becoming drunk. This causes sores, swelling, and accumulations.

○When drunk, do not overeat or become angry. This causes sores.

○If you drink cold water when drunk, your hands will tremble.

○If you sleep drunk and are exposed to wind, you will develop "alcohol wind."

○When drunk or sweating, do not let people fan you. This causes hemiplegia and stroke.

○Do not drink alcohol that has been left overnight in copper vessels

1. Precautions Regarding Tea Drinking
　The nature of tea is slightly cold. It descends qi, clears the head and eyes, removes phlegm-heat, stops thirst, aids digestion, promotes urination, and reduces sleep. It is suitable as a hot drink, but if consumed cold, it accumulates phlegm.
　It is suitable to drink in small amounts. If consumed in large quantities, it removes body fat and causes weight loss. People with deficient-cold conditions in the lower burner should not consume it.

○Tea on an empty stomach should be strictly prohibited. Especially if salt is added, it penetrates directly to the kidneys causing deficient-cold conditions. Only by using one or two cups after meals can one remove food heat without harming the spleen and stomach.

○People who easily lose seminal fluid and those who cannot retain urine should prohibit tea.

○If tea is not consumed after meals, food becomes difficult to digest and creates stagnation in the abdomen.

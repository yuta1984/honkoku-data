○During winter cold, do not go outside and expose yourself to the cold air. Also, do not warm yourself excessively by charcoal fire. Do not induce sweating.

○Regardless of winter or summer, when there are sudden strong winds and thunder that darken heaven and earth, this is because various dragons and demon spirits are moving about. At such times, do not go outside and expose yourself to this. Enter your room, close the doors, burn incense, calm your mind, and avoid this.

1. On Daoyin (Guiding and Pulling) and Massage
After midnight, or at the fifth watch, or regardless of the time—when you have nothing to do and are sitting quietly in an empty stomach state—loosen your sash, relax your clothing, and gently exhale the turbid qi from your abdomen with a "ha" sound nine times, or five to six times. Afterward, calm your mind, close your eyes, and click your teeth thirty-six times. This is to gather the spirit and strengthen the tooth roots. Then, with the back of your thumb, wipe the inner and outer corners of your eyes nine times. This clarifies the eyes and expels wind [pathogenic qi]. Also, press and rub the left and right sides of your nose seven times. Next, rub both hands together vigorously to heat them, hold your breath through mouth and nose, and massage your face. This removes wrinkles and gives luster to the face. Also massage the ear roots and ear rims.

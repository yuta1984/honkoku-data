Or if the semen becomes thin and cold like water, becoming like ice, there will be no pregnancy. Also, if a woman's qi and blood are deficient and weak, with menstruation stagnant and the uterus blocked, there will be no pregnancy. One should seek children through intercourse with robust and healthy women.

○After menstruation has already stopped, from the first day to the third day, the cervix opens. If one has intercourse at this time, pregnancy may occur. After the fourth day has passed, even if there is intercourse, pregnancy will not occur.
　Also, according to one theory, if conception occurs on the 1st, 3rd, or 5th day after menstruation stops, the child will be male; if conception occurs on the 2nd, 4th, or 6th day, the child will be female.

○Once pregnancy has occurred, sexual intercourse should be avoided. If violated during the final month, it may result in breech birth or difficult delivery, or fetal death.

○During pregnancy, one should not eat spicy or pungent foods, should not generate feelings of anger, and should always listen to good words, see good things, and perform good deeds. If one does thus, when the child is born it will surely possess good fortune, longevity, loyalty, and filial piety.

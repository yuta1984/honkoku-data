Chapter: On Clothing

○In spring, while ice has not yet [melted], you should make your outer garments thin and undergarments thick. If you make your clothing too thin in spring, food will not digest properly and you will suffer headaches.

○Generally, clothing should be put on before the cold arrives and removed before the heat arrives.

○Do not favor excessively thick clothing. If the skin becomes too warm, you will sweat easily and become more susceptible to evil influences. Also, if you wear very thin clothing and your skin becomes cold, your lungs will receive evil influences and you will have a runny nose. In severe cases, this becomes a cough.

1. Precautions Regarding Food and Drink
○When slightly hungry, one should take food early. If one becomes extremely hungry, the stomach qi becomes exhausted and diminished. If one becomes extremely hungry and then eats afterward, one should not eat to satiety. Because the stomach qi is weak, food is difficult to digest.
○One should not eat much raw or cold food.

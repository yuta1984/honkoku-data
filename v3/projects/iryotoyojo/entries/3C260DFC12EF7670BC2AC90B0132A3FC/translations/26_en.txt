Common people see such examples and say "life depends on food," considering it good to eat forcibly. This is a great error. One should eat only to the extent of not being hungry. Also, one should distinguish between foods that are beneficial and those that are not beneficial to the body, and should not consume much of things that provide no benefit. It is said, "Misfortune comes out of the mouth, and illness enters through the mouth."

1. On the Five Flavors
The classic text says: "When the five flavors are carefully harmonized, bones become upright, muscles become flexible, qi and blood flow properly, the surface tissues become dense, and one can long maintain the heavenly mandate of life."

As stated in the above text, the five flavors should be harmonized in use. One should avoid foods that are concentrated in just one or two flavors.

Too much sour flavor injures the spleen and causes the flesh to shrink
Too much salty flavor injures the heart, causing blood to dry up and complexion to change
Too much sweet flavor injures the kidneys, causing bone pain and teeth to fall out
Too much bitter flavor injures the lungs, causing skin to wither and hair to fall out
Too much pungent flavor injures the liver, causing muscles to tense and nails to wither

○One should increase or decrease flavors according to the seasons
During the seventy-two days of spring: reduce sour flavors and increase sweet flavors
During the seventy-two days of summer: reduce bitter flavors and increase pungent flavors

【The following in red ink】
The method of reading history is that recording several events is better than recording one event, and penetrating observation of the rise and fall of a hundred generations is better than observing the prosperity and decline of one generation. Sutras are different from this: knowing one sutra is better than understanding many sutras, and obtaining one verse is better than knowing one sutra. Therefore, the Confucian school advocated "one thread running through all," and Buddhism established "no dependence on words and letters." Then are sutras and histories separate? No. One is all, all is one. Whether one understands or not, one can only reflect upon oneself. This book is originally without flaw. I dare to take up the red brush and make blind commentary and mistaken discussions because I wish for elder brother's swift understanding. If the red writing is known to be blind commentary, the red writing should be removed. If this sutra does not accord with the Way, the sutra should be discarded. I trust that elder brother will pardon the sin of such disorder. 　　　　　Rōshū's second inscription

Preface to Yafune Kanwa (Night Boat Idle Talk)
　　　　　　　　　Written by the Master of Kyūbō-an, Kitō Sen
In the spring of Hōreki Teichū year, a bookseller from Chōan called Yūshōdō So-and-so sent a letter written in cursive script from afar to the attendants of my Kōrin temple, saying: "I humbly have heard that among your master's collection of old papers, there is a manuscript called 'Yafune Kanwa.' I understand that this book contains much about refining qi, nourishing essence, fulfilling people's营卫 (circulation of vital energy), and particularly gathering secrets for longevity and long life."

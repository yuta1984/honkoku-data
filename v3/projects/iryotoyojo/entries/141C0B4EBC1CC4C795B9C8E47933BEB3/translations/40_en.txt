blow air in. This is done to restore the function of the lungs in the chest that controls the intake and expulsion of breath when that function has ceased, so one should well understand this intention and carry it out. The Danchu point, located at the center between both nipples, is normally a place where acupuncture should not be applied, but for those who have suddenly died, one should deeply insert a needle more than one sun into this location, penetrating through the bone, to restore life. This is something that acupuncturists keep as a secret transmission. This is a technique to stimulate the heart and recall the ceased function back to life. Striking the back so that the resonance penetrates inside is also for the purpose of affecting the heart and lungs. One should well understand these intentions and carry this out.

Also, using a bellows to blow air into the anus, or removing the bowl of a tobacco pipe and inserting the mouthpiece end into the anus, then taking another pipe, holding smoke in the mouth, and blowing it strongly into the anus is also good.

For sneezing medicines, one may use fine powders of gleditsia and asarum, powdered black pepper, powdered long pepper, powdered melon pedicel, powdered veratrum, powdered white mustard seed, and such. If even slightly

breath can be seen to flow, sprinkle cold water on the face, or pour vinegar on heated iron implements, fired stone tiles, or charcoal fire and have them inhale the smoke, or have them drink vinegar with strong vapors mixed with copper sand, or apply moxa to Tenshu, below the navel, or the eight sores mentioned earlier. Even when vital energy has returned, if the pulse is still faint and the limbs are severely cold, take 2 monme each of aconite and ginseng, 1 monme each of dried ginger and licorice, add 1 go 8 shaku of water, decoct to 7 shaku, and have them drink it little by little. With all various sudden deaths, after understanding these principles, appropriate judgment according to the situation will emerge. Once, for a three-year-old girl whose breath had ceased due to food stagnation, I placed about 300 small purple pills on her tongue and forcefully blew in hot water, whereupon it gradually seemed to descend, and after some time she had diarrhea and was cured. These matters should also be well considered. Being bitten by a centipede is the same as being bitten by a dog mentioned earlier.

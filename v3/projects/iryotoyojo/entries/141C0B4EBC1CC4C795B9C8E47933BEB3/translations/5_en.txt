　　　　　General Principles

1. This book is intended to enable laypeople to救急 sudden illnesses. Therefore, whether in a palanquin during travel or while soldiers are stationed in garrison, by keeping this in one's breast pocket and reading it thoroughly during leisure time, and memorizing it in advance, one can treat illnesses not only for oneself but also for many others when they fall ill, even without a physician present. For this reason, the medicinal substances selected are exclusively folk remedies that have proven effectiveness and are easy to prepare. Thus, unlike the emergency medical books that have been transmitted in the world from ancient times, which merely list numerous prescriptions in vain, making it difficult for laypeople to discern which to select when faced with actual situations, this book differs from such approaches.

1. Beyond acute illnesses, I have also recorded treatments for chronic diseases and illnesses of women and children - anything that laypeople can understand and find beneficial - because I hope this might serve as an aid in saving the world.

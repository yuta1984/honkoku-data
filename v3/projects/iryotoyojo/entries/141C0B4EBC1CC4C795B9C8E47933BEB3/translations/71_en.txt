Tongue carbuncle (zetso) is a condition where initially a small sore appears on the tongue, which then becomes purulent and depressed, gradually spreading. When this deeply erodes, one cannot eat or drink, and eventually dies. It is an extremely dangerous condition. Therefore, it goes without saying that one must quickly stop this erosion, but those who develop this condition have previously had unsettled minds, pale and sallow complexions, cold lower back and legs, weak and sunken pulses, and are generally melancholic people prone to this disease. Dutch doctors skillfully explain the pathogenesis to astonish listeners, but when it comes to treatment, they are often circuitous and difficult to cure. Later physicians are naturally dull with no reliable methods, and this is not a disease to be treated with the purgative-favoring approaches of the Yoshimasu school, so when encountering this disease, most cases end in death. Originally, this condition arises from accumulated toxins combined with physical exhaustion and poor circulation of qi and blood, so from the beginning one must primarily use large doses of ginseng and aconite preparations while simultaneously eliminating toxins. However, believing what Dutch physicians say about ginseng and aconite causing inflammation and increasing toxic potency often leads to incurable outcomes. All carbuncles (so) refer to conditions that do not rise high on the surface nor swell severely, but spread deeply within the flesh - a term referring to conditions involving deficiency, which is vastly different from what Dutch physicians habitually call "inflammation." Therefore, laypeople should remember these things well and not be deceived by physicians' smooth talk.

Moreover, what people call "wind-catching" colds are actually mild forms of shanghan. Regardless of severity, those with surface symptoms of headache, chills, and fever must first induce sweating. There are various agents for inducing sweat, but during travel or military campaigns...

If one uses bloodletting or purgatives for such cases, it will immediately kill the person. This is a terrifying thing. Since Dutch doctors of today often have many such harmful practices, even laypeople should understand this well.

Also, in women's diseases, they may feel as if something is stuck in the throat, often causing pain, or there may be swelling that interferes with swallowing. This is a condition greatly different from the aforementioned throat pain and should not be confused with it. For this there is Hange-koboku-to (Pinellia and Magnolia Bark Decoction), which is an extremely gentle medicine but has a prescription that works wonderfully. The prescription is: pinellia 1 monme 6 bu, magnolia bark 6 bu, poria 8 bu, perilla leaves 4 bu, totaling 3 monme 2 bu for one dose, adding 3 slices of fresh ginger, decocting 1 gō 2 shaku of water down to 6 shaku, and using only 5-6 doses will cure it. I have also seen cases where Dutch doctors caused harm by performing bloodletting on such conditions. Since there are conditions that appear similar but are different, it is better not to do rash things. Should this not be considered carefully?

Also in children there is a condition called bahifū (horse spleen wind) where the throat passage for breathing suddenly becomes blocked, making a "hii" sound with no breath coming out, causing great distress. For this, make a fine powder of three ingredients: saltpeter 1 monme, calcined alum 5 bu, and cinnabar 3 bu, blow it into the throat with a bamboo tube, and blow in freshly drawn water mouth-to-mouth, or put it in a vessel for drinking. It works wonderfully. When using this medicine, it must always be taken with water. Hot water must never be used. Looking at what Dutch physicians do today, they give calomel and apply leeches to suck blood for this condition, but this shows inadequate understanding and often harms the patient instead. They do not know that the prescription recorded here is quick in effect and hits the mark every time.

▲For grain awns stuck in the throat, one should frequently eat hard candy. Soft candy is also good. Also, inserting a paper twist into the nose to cause sneezing can sometimes dislodge it. Fish bones stuck in the throat can sometimes also be cured by sneezing, so this should be remembered.

Before it becomes serious, quickly attach many leeches around the ear to suck blood. For internal medicine, make one dose from one monme each of rhubarb, niter, and phellodendron bark, and five bu of gardenia fruit, decoct in water and take frequently, or use Chōi-jōki-tō or Ryōkaku-san. As for higher therapeutic arts, these are not what popular doctors of the world can treat well. Much less can laypeople accomplish such treatment, but I have recorded just a portion of this as preparation for when one encounters this affliction while traveling.

For swelling and pain around the ear, apply warm compresses with camphor dissolved in vinegar, or apply the previously mentioned mixture of hemp oil and wax kneaded with borneol. Alternatively, taking equal parts of honeysuckle flowers, Job's tears flowers, and fennel with a little camphor added, warming in hot water and applying as a compress works well for both mild and severe cases.

▲When insects enter the ear, place something the insect likes around the ear and quietly wait for it to emerge. If it is difficult to come out no matter what, use a water gun to inject lukewarm water and wash inside the ear. Since the ear has what is called a membrane like a bottom, if you tilt the ear downward and wash it, it will certainly come out. Decocting and washing with things that control insects, such as morning glory leaves and chinaberry fruits, is most effective. Another method is to attach bird lime to the tip of palm fiber hair and fish out the insect. This method is most effective. It is also said that oil can be applied to the tip of a paper twist to probe the ear and fish it out. This should also be kept in mind.

Food poisoning is mostly something that occurs in those who constantly have poor digestion, and is not a disease that occurs suddenly. Those with healthy intestines and stomach who digest well, even if they occasionally overeat, will only experience slight abdominal distension and it will not become harmful. Therefore, if this is not from encountering poisonous substances, it is a disease that occurs in those with poor health habits. For mild cases, use the previously mentioned Yakuchi-in or Kenchū-san. For severe cases, use emetics or purgatives

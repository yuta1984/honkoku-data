This can happen. When this occurs, thoroughly spit saliva on the protruding eyeball, fold a hand towel and press the eyeball with both palms to push it back in. Afterward, wash with cold water and tear cotton cloth into strips about one sun wide, wrap it around the back of the head, and tie it firmly. This is because one fears it may protrude again.

Mi [Water accidents] If someone falls into water, quickly throw any available board, box, pole, or anything that can float on water and serve as something to grab onto into the water, and have them grasp it lightly. If they use too much force, they will sink together with the object. If done this way, the body will necessarily float up on the water and will not drown to death. Since the human body originally has air sacs called lungs within the chest and ribs, in truth even without something to hold onto, if one paddles the water with hands, one will naturally float and everything above the nipples should be above water. However, people drown because they panic. It is the same principle that allows dogs and cats to swim across water naturally when they enter it. Whether one dies or survives after falling into water depends simply on whether the mind remains calm or becomes agitated - this should be well understood.

The reason why modern swimming instructors, clinging to horses, barely manage to cross water with both human and horse struggling, is because they cut the tendons of the horse's tail and remove the hooves, damaging the horse's natural abilities. This should be carefully considered.

▲For those who have drowned to death in water, quickly remove their clothes and belt, strip them naked, grab both legs, lift them upside down, put both legs over the shoulders, bend forward slightly so as to press the drowned person's abdomen with one's back, and walk while making them vomit water. Alternatively, it is also good to lay them face up, bend the legs forward over the shoulders, keep them standing, and have another person strongly massage the abdomen to make them vomit water. The Chinese method of placing them on an ox's back, having the abdomen pressed by the ox's back while walking to make them vomit water, is troublesome and inconvenient. Simply lifting them upside down will necessarily make the water come out.

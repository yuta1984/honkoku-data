One must always draw out the poison and let it become pus to cure it. When a bubo (venereal swelling) is about to develop, even if the pain is severe, one should force oneself to walk to quickly encourage the pus to rupture. One must not use needles while it has not yet suppurated, because the poison will remain and cause later harm. If the pus matures well at this stage, one can avoid future suffering. If staying at an inn, after bathing, wrap white mustard seed powder in cloth, squeeze it in hot water, and apply it as a warm compress every evening. Before the pus ruptures, one must absolutely not take medicines called "bubo purging drugs." Medicines containing calomel are also harmful when used to encourage suppuration. Therefore, when returning home, one should entrust treatment to a skilled physician to receive treatment that leaves no future harm. When there is momentum for suppuration, one must not do anything rash and should leave it to nature. Therefore, I do not record prescriptions rashly.

▲For arsenic poisoning as well, if one takes oil early, it will encapsulate and suppress the poison so that it does not lead to death, as previously stated. That peach kernel paste (ground) can neutralize the toxic flames of gunpowder is based on the same principle.

▲For tobacco intoxication, one should take vinegar. Alternatively, decocting licorice is also good.

▲For suffering from choking on tobacco smoke, one should drink pressed radish juice.

▲For poisoning from eating octopus, put funori seaweed into hot water to dissolve it, then strain out the residue and drink it.

▲For poisoning from eating too many bamboo shoots, one should either eat much ginger, or squeeze its juice, mix it with sugar, and dissolve it in hot water for use. Decocted arame seaweed juice, funori juice, and buckwheat hull decoction also neutralize bamboo shoot poison well. For severe pain, one should take sesame oil.

▲Sudden apoplexy is a type of disease called "reversal."

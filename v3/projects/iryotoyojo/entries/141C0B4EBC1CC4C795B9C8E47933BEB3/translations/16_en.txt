becomes blocked and ineffective, blow fine powder of borneol through a tube. Or blow in fine powder of asarum, soap pod, or alternatively swertia, veratrum, or melon pedicel powder. If these types are also difficult to obtain, insert paper twisted into a cord deeply to induce sneezing ▲What is called "horse spleen wind" is a disease that occurs in small children. One should look at what is recorded in the section on throat pain under the "no" section next. There are cases where one suddenly dies and the cause cannot be determined. Some are caused by felonous poison. This will be discussed later in the section under the character "chi." When one suddenly cannot speak and becomes unable to make sounds, but there is no change in mental state, mix equal parts of daikon radish and ginger juice, drink it bit by bit frequently, calm the qi, count breaths so that they reach below the navel, and sit quietly for a while - this will surely heal. However, those who develop this condition must be careful with their recuperation afterward, as they may develop apoplexy and such, so one must be cautious. Trismus is a disease of newborns, and at first, they cry incessantly

without stopping, gradually lose their voice and breathing becomes labored, then they clench their mouth shut and cannot open it. Therefore it is also called "tsubokuchi" (closed mouth). It is an acute serious illness, and while trying various treatments, the hands and feet become cold and the child dies. One must notice early, open the mouth, and examine inside and outside the gums. There are many small blood blisters, tiny as millet grains, round and red like winter cherry. These should be broken with fingernails or needles to release blood, then apply a mixture of five parts fine borax powder, two parts refined cinnabar or native cinnabar, and about one part sal ammoniac with a brush tip, and quickly give large amounts of purple pills to purge. At the pharmacy, buy large purple pills and crush them for use, but some infants have died because the pills stuck to the mouth and throat, causing swelling that prevented nursing, so for infants one must obtain pills as small as poppy seeds, and for umbilical wind or trismus, put about fifty pills at a time into the throat and pour in hot water - they will swallow well. Especially for this trismus, give two or three poppy seed-sized doses per day and night

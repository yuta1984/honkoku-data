Since many physicians do not know how to treat this condition, many people needlessly carry the disease throughout their lives and some even die young from it. Therefore, among the medicinal formulas for treating this disease, I will present here one formula that laypeople can prepare themselves.

The formula consists of: iron powder 20 monme, bracken starch 10 monme, sulfur and calcined oyster shell 5 monme each, dried ginger and licorice 2 monme each.

This medicine primarily treats conditions where excessive nosebleeds and rectal bleeding cause blood deficiency, and water mixes with the blood throughout the body, causing the face and entire body to turn yellow with poor luster, skin appearing swollen, and in severe cases, the nails turn white and crack.

Sometimes an infant's stools become sour-smelling and then turn blue due to the mother's or wet nurse's illness. In such cases, both mother and child must be treated - this should be understood.

For those who cannot sleep after drinking tea, dried plums should be taken with sugar water. Strong vinegar also effectively neutralizes tea's toxicity.

For gonorrhea with severe pain and difficulty urinating, use 2 monme of peach gum and 1 monme of licorice as one dose, decocting with 1 go of water reduced to 5 shaku, taking 3-4 doses daily. Peach gum is available at medicine shops. Also good is grinding walnuts to a paste-like consistency, adding an appropriate amount of rock sugar, and mixing with hot water. For gonorrhea with pus discharge, the yin...

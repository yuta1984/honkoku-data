However, this is a technique that uses a syringe to wash deep inside the uterus and then insert suppositories to stop the bleeding, so it is difficult to perform in a travel inn. In any case, when there is heavy bleeding, the body quickly becomes exhausted, so one should know how to stop it promptly.

The method is to bundle about twenty monme of silk wadding into a small bundle, insert it into the vagina, have the patient lie on her side (whether right or left), twist the upper leg toward the opposite side, and firmly press and rub the buttock muscles with the palm of the hand - this will cause the vaginal opening to close tightly.

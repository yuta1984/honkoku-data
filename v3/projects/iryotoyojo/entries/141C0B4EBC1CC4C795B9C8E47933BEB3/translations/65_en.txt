Since this is acceptable, when there is no surgeon available, rather than leaving it as is without stopping the bleeding and letting life become endangered, it is better to suture quickly. However, if bandaging alone is done well, most wounds are fine without suturing.

For cotton, use what is called "white bleached cloth," remove both edges, tear it into about eight strips and use. Apply a little sesame oil to the sutured area, and as a clamp, apply torn cotton with egg white, or use fish glue ointment or commercial instant-effect paper as a plaster. Place folded cotton soaked in vinegar on top of this. Then wrap with torn cotton. In summer, it is also good not to apply sesame oil.

Blood vessels that have blood running out will also begin to heal after three hours have passed, so it is best to prevent excessive bleeding in any case.

The foremost substance for stopping bleeding is hahasodake (a type of fungus). Remove the hard skin on top, pound it well with a mallet and store it, tearing it to an appropriate size for use. Next is niretake (elm fungus), and after that is babo (puffball fungus) that grows in the shade of forests, bamboo groves, cliffs, etc., also called mimitsubure or hokoridake. Store these and tear them for use.

All of these can be taken internally. They are said to have good blood-stopping effects, but I have not yet tested this. If taking internally, powder finely and use with cold water.

For blade wounds where blood gushes out greatly, this is because a major artery has been severed, and if the bleeding does not stop, death will occur immediately. Therefore, one must pull out the blood vessel and tie it with thread, or apply heated iron to seal it. While this is difficult for amateurs to perform, if one is traveling in mountains where there are no doctors, one could heat a pipe bowl or any available object until red-hot and use it to stop bleeding. In any case, with this understanding, one should quickly stop the bleeding.

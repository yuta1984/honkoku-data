▲Galloping dental gan (sōba gakan) is a pediatric acute disease called "hakusa," where the gums rot, all teeth fall out, and it erodes even the lips and cheeks, leading to death - a terrible disease.

For those whose bowels haven't moved for several days, who have yellow coating on the tongue, have lost taste, and have headaches, use Stomach-Regulating Qi-Bearing Decoction (chōi jōki-tō). The prescription is: eight bu of Chinese rhubarb, one monme six bu of mirabilite, three bu of licorice root, decocted and used.

In such cases, Shirakawa aconite or Uzutō may be substituted. Have thin rice gruel or some warm food to warm the body and induce sweating. If the pulse is not sunken but there is a strong tendency toward fever, obtain about five bu of saltpeter, put it in strong vinegar, add plenty of hot water to it, and use this to induce sweating.

To induce the cellulitis poison and extract the root, the Gedai-hiyō recommends applying cantharides (spotted beetle). Cantharides has the same efficacy as Katsujo-teichō and is somewhat superior, but since it is not readily available, Katsujo-teichō may be used instead. This should be kept applied until the root emerges. When this becomes itchy and the pain becomes unbearable, one should consider that healing is near. There are various other internal medicines and topical applications, but I only show what should be done to rescue the dangerous situation of initial internal invasion.

Also, when cellulitis poison draws red blood vessels, this is called Kōshi-chō (red thread cellulitis). When it occurs on the hand, it reaches the chest; when it occurs on the face, lips, etc., it descends to the throat. When it reaches the chest and throat, it causes vomiting, agitation, and leads to death - it is a terrible disease. Therefore, when these blood vessels appear, quickly leave about two to three bu at the tip of the direction the vessel is extending, puncture about three bu deep from above the vessel, and squeeze out the blood. Internal medicines and topical applications are as mentioned above. It is also said that snails should be pounded together with their shells and applied to the site where acupuncture was performed on cellulitis.

▲Stroke. In ancient times it was called "hi," and hi was said to be a disease of one side, meaning a disease where either the right or left side becomes paralyzed and disabled. It seems to occur suddenly, but there are always warning signs. These signs can be recognized if one is aware and thinks about them, so during travel or military campaigns, one should be prepared in advance. To outline these warning signs: movement and posture become restricted, hands tremble, when trying to write the brush stumbles, fingers become numb and one often drops things. The tongue frequently stiffens making speech difficult, rice grains leak from the mouth, or one becomes forgetful, becomes passive in all matters, and even when using laxatives, bowel movements are difficult.

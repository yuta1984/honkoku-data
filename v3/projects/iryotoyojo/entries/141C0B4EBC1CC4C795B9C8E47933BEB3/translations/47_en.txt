This is what one relies upon. For purgatives during travel or military campaigns, one should prepare and carry "Modified Potassium Nitrate Great Pills." The prescription is: Chinese rhubarb 8 ryō, official ginseng 6 ryō, refined potassium nitrate 4 ryō, Chinese licorice 3 ryō. These four ingredients are ground to fine powder and made into pills. Also, adding 3 shō of water to 100 monme of Chinese rhubarb, decocting to 1 shō, straining the dregs, putting back on fire, and when reduced to about 5 gō, adding 50 monme of refined potassium nitrate and 100 monme of white honey and boiling, then concentrating with rice gruel water until it becomes like hard candy, storing in a vessel, and dissolving in hot water when needed - this is considered especially good.

Therefore, it ultimately results from being struck by cold qi and becoming ill, not from being injured by summer heat.

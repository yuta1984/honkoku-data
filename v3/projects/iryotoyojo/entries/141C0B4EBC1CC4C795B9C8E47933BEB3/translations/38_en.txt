Those with swelling, blue discoloration, bumpy raised spots appearing here and there, soft flesh that when pressed remains flattened, foul-smelling fluid flowing from mouth and nose, sunken eyes with open mouth, and a detestable corpse odor - these cannot be saved.

Those who can be saved and revived: if you quietly focus your attention and examine them carefully, you will find lips that occasionally twitch; when you take a candle and shine it into the eyes, the pupils contract, and when you move the candle away they open; when you place your hand on the solar plexus and examine, you feel warmth inside; when you bring a lamp wick or bird feather or candle flame near the mouth and nose area, it appears to move; or the eyes - whether left or right - one side opens while the other closes; cheeks that still have some redness; blood flowing from abraded areas; when you put your mouth to the ear and call their name, the facial muscles appear to move; when you press firmly with your fingertip on the area above the eyebrow and release, the depressed area gradually returns to its

original state. Among these nine signs, if two or three are present, you must not necessarily determine that they are dead. No matter what acute illness has caused the breathing to stop, properly distinguishing between those who can be saved and those who cannot, and making this determination, is an urgent and crucial matter in diagnosis.

Most physicians of recent times are callous, and few apply deep attention to diagnosis, so even laypeople should carefully verify what is described here and endeavor to provide rescue.

Now, when there is acute illness with sudden death, the first thing to understand is that for those whose breathing has stopped, using so-called restorative medicines made with honey is extremely harmful. In a throat where breath does not pass, even the slightest substance becomes an obstruction, thereby further blocking the passage of breath and preventing even those who should live from being revived. Therefore, not only honey-based medicines but also pills, powders, and decoctions should be completely avoided while breathing has not returned.

　This is the general overview. This compilation was
　originally intended for emergency use,
　but if one tries to hastily search through it
　during a critical moment, one will likely
　fall into the error described by the proverb
　"catching a thief and then braiding the rope."
　Therefore, I hope that many people will
　read through the entire work carefully during
　peaceful times, learn it in advance,
　and use it to relieve suffering.

Emergency Medical Compendium
When someone becomes extremely angry, they may suddenly lose consciousness and appear to die. This happens because blood and qi rush upward. In the "ra" section under "death by lightning strike," there is a resuscitation technique involving massaging the shoulders that can revive most people. After breathing resumes, if the shoulders remain stiff and upward rushing is strong, it is good to puncture the shoulders and apply cupping horns to draw out much blood. Alternatively, it is also good to use medications like Xiaoshi Dayuan mentioned in the "no" section under "upward rushing" to provide gentle purgation. ▲Regarding illness from dog bites: if one understands the cause, treatment becomes clear, so I will first explain this. Generally, humans and animals have different natural constitutions and differ greatly. When a dog bites, saliva from its teeth remains in the wound and mixes with human blood, spreading throughout the body until even the mind becomes disturbed, causing the person to imitate dogs by howling and eventually die. Therefore, this saliva must be thoroughly removed.

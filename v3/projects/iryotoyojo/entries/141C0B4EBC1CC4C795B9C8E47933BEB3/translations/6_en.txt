1. Even if it is just one prescription or one technique, I have omitted anything that lacks proper foundation and is not reliable. Therefore, among what is recorded in this compilation, I have thoroughly documented even those remedies that the world holds as merely single prescriptions, calling them miraculous formulas and wonderful medicines, keeping them secret and not transmitting them carelessly. Hence, though this compilation is merely a small booklet, when one follows it well to treat acute illnesses, one can achieve far superior treatment compared to those incompetent and timid physicians in the world who, when faced with emergencies, panic and become flustered together with laypeople, making them unreliable to entrust with care. Moreover, even physicians, if they read this morning and evening and come to understand it themselves, will be able to save many more people, because the entire compilation consists entirely of practical methods, with absolutely no recording of crude, useless matters.

1. When my former teacher Master Keizan, following the command of his father Master Rankei, compiled the "Kōkei Saikyū-hō," my teacher was exclusively in charge of that work. Later, he again collected what had been omitted and authored the "Kyūkyū Sen-hō," whereby medical emergency literature for both physicians and laypeople became completely established. Now this compilation includes both what was recorded in those two books and what was omitted from them, as well as folk remedies transmitted among the people and experiments from my own discoveries, all listed together. However, since this is originally a small booklet for carrying in one's pocket, it does not extend to recording in detail their similarities, differences, sources, and so forth. I ask readers to forgive this.

1. In the "Saikyū-hō," diagrams of medicinal substances and acupuncture points were provided, with careful instruction given. Where explanations in this compilation relate to those, they should be consulted for reference. Though this compilation divides sections according to the iroha syllabary, I have again followed the table of contents of the "Kōkei Saikyū-hō," simply incorporating "foreign objects entering the nine orifices" into "acute violent symptoms" and listing it alongside "chronic mild symptoms," with only the "wounds and ulcers" section kept separate. This is all for the convenience of cross-referencing with that book when searching for acute conditions.

or 2 monme. Dried ginger 8 bu. Licorice 6 bu. The four ingredients combined total 3 monme 6 bu, or 4 monme 6 bu. Add 1 gō 5 shaku of water and decoct to 6 shaku, then take 2-3 doses consecutively.

If diarrhea is not particularly severe but vomiting is intense and cannot be stopped, use licorice and dried ginger, 1 monme each. Combine the two ingredients to make 2 monme, add 1 gō of water, and decoct to 5 shaku. This is called Licorice and Dried Ginger Decoction. For very mild cases, use Alpinia Drink: Chinese costus root, Chinese evodia, and Chinese alpinia, about 6 bu each. Add 1 gō of water, and when it boils, remove from fire, strain the dregs, and use. Alternatively, one may remove the evodia and add fresh patchouli leaves. For those with diarrhea, adding Chinese galangal is also good. Jianzhong Powder may also be used.

If vomiting and diarrhea are so severe that there seems no time to decoct medicine, moxibustion should be applied to the Tianshu points on the abdomen. These are located 1 sun 2-3 bu away from the navel in an adult's body, with left and right points separated by 2 sun 5-6 bu. To locate these precisely, use a paper twist or rice straw to measure between the nipples, fold it into eight parts, discard half, fold the remaining half in two again, place the fold at the navel, and mark points at the left and right ends.

These moxibustion points are among those mentioned earlier for reviving those who died from lightning strikes - the revival methods for sudden death. They respond well to internal resonance, so for severe vomiting and diarrhea in cholera, and for yin patterns in cold damage disease, their immediate effectiveness surpasses medicine - this I have learned through decades of trial. The eight-flower moxibustion mentioned earlier is also good, so whichever method is used, swift moxibustion is best.

Also, when there is neither vomiting nor diarrhea, but the epigastrium feels painfully constricted, with abdominal pain and restless agitation, and the chest feels tightly blocked making breathing difficult, first have the patient insert a finger to induce vomiting. If this fails to produce vomiting, dip the tip of a bird's feather in a little oil and probe deep into the back of the throat. If this still produces no vomiting, use "melon pedicel" from Echizen province...

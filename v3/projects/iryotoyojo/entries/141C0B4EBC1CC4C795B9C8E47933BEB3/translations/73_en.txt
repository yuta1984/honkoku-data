This is similar to how what was transmitted by foreigners in Hakata, Chikuzen Province was called "Tang sores" (Chinese sores). These diseases are each a type of poison that spreads from person to person and causes illness. However, because few people advocate correct etiology instead of speculative misunderstandings and perform appropriate treatments, they remain incurable. Therefore, one should now understand that this disease poison spreading from person to person is the same as planting seeds of plants and trees or propagating through root division, and should consider preventing such transmission and quickly eliminating it in the early stages of infection.

Since it can be transmitted through bedding and such places in travelers' inns, if two or three lesions appear between the fingers while traveling, one should quickly pierce them with needles or small knives, squeeze out the blood, and then apply finely powdered sulfur. The sulfur used at this time may be scraped from what is used for kindling. Where pharmacies are available, it is good to buy and apply fine powder of what is called "cormorant eyes" and "hawk eyes."

If one adds three parts camphor and one part alum to one monme of mineral sulfur (what the world calls gold sulfur) and applies the fine powder, it is most effective. Even when the poison has already spread to the upper arms and elbows, if blood is squeezed out from each lesion and this medicine is applied, it can effectively eliminate the poison. This is based on frequent trials that have proven effective.

Also, the smoke of wax is remarkably effective at eliminating this poison. No matter how extensively it has spread throughout the body, if one burns wax daily and fumigates the entire body with its smoke, it will eventually heal without internal invasion and be cured.

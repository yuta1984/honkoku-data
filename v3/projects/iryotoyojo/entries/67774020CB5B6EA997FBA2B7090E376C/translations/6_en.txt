also arise within. From this we can see that all things are diseases of heaven and earth. Trees grow from soil - trees are the disease of soil. Therefore, soil is killed by trees. Insects arise in trees, and those trees inevitably wither. In fields, much grass grows making the fields wild, and many insects arise in the grass, eating the leaves. Beasts arise in forests and bore through tree roots. Lice arise on the body and suck blood from it. When in things, it is the disease of those things; when in heaven and earth, the disease of heaven and earth; when in water, the disease of water; when in stones and trees, the disease of stones and trees. Including ourselves within this, all things are entirely diseases of heaven and earth. Long ago, Ji Huanzi dug a well and obtained something like a sheep. Everyone said it was a dog. When he asked Confucius about it, he said it was a sheep. Confucius cited similar cases, saying that monsters of wood and stone are called mōryō. The commentary says they are creatures with one leg.

Water-born mysterious things are called bōshō - creatures without eyes or mouth, it is said. Those born from earth are called funʾyō, it is said. What Huanzi dug up was a monster born from earth. When Daitokuji was first established in Murasakino and they dug a pond in the garden, court officials formed karmic connections with the founding master, each carrying soil in brocade bags, so this is called the Officials' Pond. It is the pond that still exists in front of the abbot's quarters today. When digging this pool, something emerged from beneath the soil that had no hands, feet, eyes, or mouth, just a soft, shapeless form. Everyone found this strange. The founding master named it the House Buddha, buried it under the dharma hall to serve as the mountain's protector, and from that day forward, offerings are made perpetually. This is called the Sect Buddha Memorial Day, as recorded in writing and passed down by word of mouth.

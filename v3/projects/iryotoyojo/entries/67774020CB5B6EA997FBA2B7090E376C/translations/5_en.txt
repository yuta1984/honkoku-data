This occurrence of events from tranquility and generation of things from nothingness happens when yin and yang intermix, pure and turbid blend together, and then forms of things arise between them, giving rise to events.

Such things happen commonly everywhere. Turtles, frogs, and similar creatures also arise when yin and yang intermix, pure and turbid blend together creating impurity, within the human body

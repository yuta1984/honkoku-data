The arts of longevity and life cultivation also require strengthening the foundation and understanding the types of poor health practices, then applying one's mind to this above all else. Moreover, when illness occurs and one exhausts good doctors and medicines, if one does not prohibit toxins and continues poor health practices, those toxins become stronger than the medicine and the illness becomes increasingly severe.

Throughout his life he kept this in mind, did not agitate his mind, and did not decline even into old age.

The Secret Treatise of the Mysterious Gate says: "When one is without mind toward affairs, then there are no affairs in the mind. Therefore, when the mind is calm, wisdom arises; when the mind moves, confusion arises."
These four phrases are the secret matters of life cultivation.

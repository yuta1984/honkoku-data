　Precious Instructions for Following Life

Laozi said: The great span of human life has a limit of one hundred years. Those who moderate and protect this can reach a thousand years, like the difference between a small wick and a large wick in oil. The masses speak loudly while I speak softly; the masses have many troubles while I remember few; the masses are fearful and angry while I do not anger.

Zhuangzi said: Those who can follow the way of life, even if wealthy and noble, do not harm their bodies through養生 (nurturing life); even if poor and lowly, do not burden their physical form through pursuit of profit.

○The "Luo River Book of Precious Child Destiny" says: The ancient method of treating illness was to harmonize with sweet spring water, moisten with primordial qi, using medicines that were neither pungent nor bitter but sweet and flavorful. Constantly taking these allows vital fluids to flow through the five organs, connecting to the lungs, ensuring lifelong freedom from illness.

○The "Supreme Nine Practices" says: Practice non-action, practice gentleness and weakness, maintain the feminine principle and do not be first to act - these are called the upper three practices. Practice namelessness, practice purity, practice all good deeds - these are called the middle three practices. Practice loyalty and filial piety, practice contentment, practice yielding and deference - these are called the lower three practices.

The Jade Pivot Sutra says: The Way is entered through sincerity, maintained through silence, and applied through gentleness - then one can nearly achieve it.

When the five-color spectacles were sold to bookstores, woodblock prints and illustrated storybooks all appeared in five colors, so the carving and printing of multi-colored prints became unnecessary. With just black ink on a single printing block, they appear as if they were multi-colored prints. People think they're buying regular illustrated books and take them home. The storybooks also appear in five colors, so customers think "five-color printed storybooks are rare!" and they become extremely popular.

All the customers who come to buy the latest trends are made to wear those five-color spectacles to view the books and pictures, so they believe they're genuine and all buy them. By doing this, instead of using red and indigo inks, the printing costs are greatly reduced, and labor costs are also saved. The profit from ten or twenty pairs of spectacles is quite substantial, so it's amusing that all the bookstores in Edo bought them up.

Even when people know that the spectacles they're being made to wear are just ordinary spectacles, it's still strange to look through them.

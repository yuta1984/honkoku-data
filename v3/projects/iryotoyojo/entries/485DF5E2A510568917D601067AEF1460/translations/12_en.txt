Here again is the scholar's spectacles. Their function is such that even completely unlearned people can read square characters (Chinese characters) fluently. The method of making these is to take dictionaries of the Four Books, dictionaries of the Five Classics, or for popular works, the Bunrin Setsuyō, iroha dictionaries, Gyokuhen, Thousand Character Classic, etc., wash them well with pure water, thoroughly remove all finger stains, combine them with morning dew on the night of the Boys' Festival in May, grind them into fine powder, and put this into the spectacles. Thus, even those who until yesterday could not read the character "great" in the "Great Learning"...

Yesterday there was a meeting of the Elementary Learning group at the place of Daigaku-ya and Rongo-rō of Mencius and Classic of Filial Piety, but their host Chūyō was away, so I was made to stay the night. That Classic of Filial Piety fellow really isn't the right person for this.

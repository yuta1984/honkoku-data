should not come toward the camp. Especially during hot weather, the stench of decaying matter and excrement, when it touches people's bodies and enters the body through breathing, inevitably becomes a cause of disease, so this too must be kept in mind. ※Note: "Fortress Grass" states: "Nothing surpasses fire in avoiding noxious vapors."
※During prolonged rain, fire should be kept burning continuously. That the ancients always carried fire-striking pouches shows various preparations should be inferred. Among all living things, what makes humans spiritually superior is said to be primarily their ability to create fire.
※One must not carelessly enter houses, garden groves, elevated pavilions, lakeside buildings, abandoned temples, old pagodas, or places long unopened. Sleeping in such places is naturally forbidden.

Unlike ancient times, in today's world there are many frail and sickly warriors, so such consideration must be included within the ancient system of military provisions. If many die of illness due to food their stomachs cannot tolerate, this is the fault of commanders who are not thorough in their orders. No matter how lowly a foot soldier may be, to treat them lightly and work them cruelly, neglecting even matters of food, is the height of inhumanity and the fundamental cause of weapons becoming dull.

and thus be able to repay the benevolence of being nurtured by those below. However, in today's world, while farmers living in remote areas are actually sincere and resolute, the merchants who make their living in castle towns have customs that are entirely heartless, and many are cowardly and lazy. What is the reason for this? It is because merchants regularly associate with warriors and, seeing and hearing their extravagant and lazy conduct, they disregard their proper station, lavish expense on gorgeous clothing and implements, squander their wealth on wine, food, and entertainment. The wealthy among them even forget that they are merchants, indulge in luxury equal to that of feudal lords, and many even come to despise and look down upon warriors. This began with being influenced by the corrupt customs of the warrior houses, and also because warriors lack discernment and, for the sake of wealth, fawn and flatter the merchant houses.

This happens because of such circumstances. Since farmers have little association with warriors, they have no opportunity to observe their extravagant ways. Being content with coarse food and rough clothing, their hearts do not race after external things, they do not bend their will for material desires, and since they do not damage their innate good qualities, the resolute and unpretentious conduct that approaches benevolence actually remains more with the farmers—this is clearly recognized. Moreover, even though warriors may be poor in their households, since they stand above the four classes of people, they fail to consider that what they should aspire to differs greatly from merchants. Due to their hearts constantly envying and longing for the prosperity of merchant houses, they gradually become infected with merchant customs, and as only greedy thoughts increase, their ordinary conduct naturally puts profit first and righteousness second, until finally they become people who flatter and fawn.

　　For the ankle bone as well,
　　　using the same method as treating the wrist,
　　　　rotate it away
　　　　　while pulling it
　　　　　　　toward oneself and
　　　　　　stretching it,
　　　　　　　　it will immediately return
　　　　　　　　　　　　to its original state.

　Regarding the above nine diagrams, although the bone shapes are not
　　　　　　　　　　identical,
　　they are all fitted into the hollow
　　　recesses of joints, and when
　　　they become misaligned, one should understand that simply pulling and
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　stretching them
　　　　to restore them to their proper position
　　　　　　is the essential principle of bone-setting.

Preface to the Sequel of Emergency Medical Prescriptions
The lands in all four directions ruled by the Great Imperial Deity
extend to the limits where heaven's walls stand, to the boundaries where the nation's borders rise,
to where blue clouds trail across the sky, where white clouds descend
toward the distant horizon, and the blue ocean reaches to where boats' rudders and
poles extend, to the furthest point where ship sterns arrive and stop,
as sea routes continue across the great ocean, narrow lands become vast.

【The beginning of this preface is a passage from Shinto prayers and harvest festival liturgies.】

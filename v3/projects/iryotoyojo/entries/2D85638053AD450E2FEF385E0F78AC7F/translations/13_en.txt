Therefore, when our countrymen advance deeply into close combat, these sword-bayonet guns should be immediately cut and severed in two. In such deep penetration and close combat, helmets and armor are obviously essential equipment, but when this spirit is extended outward, it also generates a mysterious power to overwhelm others, so arrows and cannon balls are avoided and do not harm the body. 《This matter should be discussed later. Having understood that this power exists, I have personally named it "protective qi"》 However, if there is a gap in this qi and one receives an enemy bullet, not to mention the vital points of the head, face, chest, and abdomen, but when the bird gun's power is weak and the bullet stops in bones of the elbow, upper arm, thigh, shin, etc., these can be treated with the spiral drill, double-hook extractor, and goose-bill forceps that I will illustrate later.

You should know that these three types, due to the narrow paper space, are not accurately depicted in their true form in the drawings.

[he said] how could [the son] have become so inferior to this extent, and greatly lamented. Indeed, unless even the common soldiers truly submit from the bottom of their hearts, true courage will not emerge, so the benevolence that well wins over all retainers should be the most important mindset.

　　　On Cultivating Qi to Generate Power that Overwhelms Enemies
The great qi fills the space between heaven and earth, and from ancient times it has been said that "the earth is lifted up by this great qi." Generally speaking, the sun, moon, and stars of heaven and earth, humans and animals, plants and trees—all things are as if dissolved within this great qi, forming one mass. This qi circulates and revolves through this space without stopping, and at times there are phases of fullness and emptiness, contraction and expansion. Because it possesses natural mathematical principles within these phases of fullness/emptiness and contraction/expansion, the human body, being one with heaven and earth, likewise has these same phases of fullness/emptiness and contraction/expansion, and all things under heaven are equipped with these mathematical principles. 《Interlinear note: I have previously recorded this matter in my "Essentials of Health Cultivation," "Theory of Cultivating Qi," etc.》 The qi that extends from this body to protect it is called "defensive qi." 《Interlinear note: That heaven, earth, nations, and states have their own defensive qi is also discussed in the same work》 This defensive qi, when expanded, controls others; when contracted, is controlled by others. When it greatly extends outward, swords cannot cut it, and arrows and planes cannot harm it

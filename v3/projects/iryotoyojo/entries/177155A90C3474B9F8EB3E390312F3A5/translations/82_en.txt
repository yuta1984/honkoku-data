In ancient times, things were formed purely from vital essence (seiki), but as we approach the end times, the yin-yang qi becomes turbid and congealed, transforming into evil spirits, epidemic gods, smallpox deities, and malaria gods. Therefore, the treatise on malaria discussed in the ancient medical classic Neijing describes conditions arising from the stagnation of proper qi of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness, and thus the treatment methods primarily employed acupuncture, moxibustion, and herbal medicines. Today's malaria is caused by impure turbid qi combined with malevolent spiritual qi of seasonal influences, so all treatment methods rely on mysterious arts.

Regarding the earlier question about why something invisible to family members becomes visible to outsiders, there is one principle at work. Those epidemic gods, tengu, and various demons and spirits are all phantasmal forms, not real entities. Just as water dragons create mirages, rats create hiding places, monkeys create castles, and fish and turtles create dragon palaces - none of these are real substances but illusions. It is like how illusionists create water where there is none and fire where there is none.

One year, at the Hashimoto ferry at the foot of Mount Kasagi in Yamato, a monkey trainer came and asked to be ferried across. When told to pay the fare, he said he had no money, so they refused to take him and would not launch the boat. The monkey trainer, having no choice, decided to cross on foot, splashing into the water and wading across. The passengers on the boat thought it looked dangerous, but he crossed without difficulty.

It is inevitable that poverty and disasters will naturally befall them. Moreover, the inhumanity of parents killing their children to hide their own shame is beyond words. Looking at it from a distance, the hidden evil of women surpasses that of men. This originates from adultery, and then to kill the result - such shameless and unconscionable acts are fearsome and detestable. Even if a husband might encourage this because he dislikes having many children, while women should fear and grieve over it, we often see women themselves taking the initiative to abort children - such cruelty is extreme. While medicine should have benevolent arts as its front, having harmful practices behind it goes against the profound principles of medical practice.

The first of the Ten Prohibitions for Medical Practitioners states "Do not enter women's chambers with ulterior motives," which warns that one must never speak frivolously to sick women or female patients, and must not take their pulse without attendants present. According to Tang dynasty law, when examining the pulse of women of the rank of minister or above, curtains and screens were used as barriers, and thin silk was placed over the women's hands when taking their pulse. For this reason, there is no method of abdominal examination in China. In our country, it is said that not examining the abdomen makes one's medical practice crude, so both men and women undergo abdominal examination, but one must be careful that pulse-taking below the lower dantian is unnecessary.

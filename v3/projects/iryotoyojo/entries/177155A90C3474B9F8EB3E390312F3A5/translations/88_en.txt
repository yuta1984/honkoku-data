After that, the sound of Otowa Falls ceased, and though no one jumped from the stage, things declined. The eaves of Tamura Hall rotted and became desolate. Yet what was all that great crowd and commotion at Kiyomizu slope afterward? This was not all the work of Kannon but came from people's preferences. The water at Jōnanji Temple is the same water that existed in the past and exists now, yet thirty-four or thirty-five years ago, there was a year when people flocked from the capital region and neighboring provinces for "Jōnanji water" - what was that all about?

Long ago during the Kan'ei era, at a farmer's house in some village in the northern provinces, one day late at night someone knocked on the door. When asked "Who is it?", the voice said, "A mountain witch has given birth in this area. If you have miso soup, please give some." It happened that there was miso soup with dumplings, so they served it in an earthenware bowl, which the visitor took and left. The next day, in the rice fields around there, it appeared that a mountain witch had indeed given birth, as there were defiled things, and the earthenware bowl given the night before was also there. So thinking that a mountain witch had certainly given birth, the farmer thought, "My daughter is also due to give birth this month. May she be blessed and give birth safely," and prayed. Soon after, she had a safe delivery. When he boasted to the neighboring old woman that "thanks to the mountain witch's blessing, she had a safe birth," she replied, "My daughter's delivery is due at such and such time, my daughter-in-law's is at such and such time."

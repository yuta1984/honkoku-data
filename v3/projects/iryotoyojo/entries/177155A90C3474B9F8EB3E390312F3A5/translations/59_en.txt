Along with daily life, doctors particularly forget the mental strain they have endured, and when it comes to New Year's Eve, it feels like being in debt, causing distress at that time. Generally, when doctors are slow to respond and cannot arrive promptly in urgent situations, it is due to meager compensation given privately. If one regularly sends seasonal gifts to favored doctors, never fails to send greetings during hot and cold seasons to elderly doctors, faithfully trusts them when illness arises, and provides generous compensation promptly after treatment ends, even slow-moving doctors will naturally become more responsive. There are two types of sluggishness. First, when the patient's family is habitually indifferent or when an unpopular doctor is occasionally called to just one house, changing clothes and stopping the servant's rope-making is troublesome, so they often just reply "I understand" and don't move. Doctors over forty, especially when awakened by knocking in the middle of a cold night after warming up in bed, click their tongues two or three hundred times and tell household members to "light the fire, boil water," incurring unexpected preparation costs that patients never notice. However, they will run through snow to wealthy patients' homes because doctors all suffer from the ailment of greed.

The three matters concerning the young acolyte are said to be like Suzuki's journey down to Ōshū, as one should understand. A temple acolyte fled back to his parents' home and said to his father and mother: "The priest's strictness and irritability are now unbearable. Look at this," showing his head covered with fresh wounds that never heal. What is particularly troublesome is that he serves our morning and evening meals by hitting them with a lid. He is short-tempered and busy, calling 'boy, boy' without giving us time to respond. When we go to the privy, if we stay long, he beats us with a stick. This way, we cannot even preserve our lives," he wept and complained. The father listened and said, "Is this true? What an unbenevolent and merciless priest! This is very different from his appearance. Come, let us ask for his dismissal and bring him home."

So he rushed to the temple and laid out these three matters one by one, expressing his heart's concerns. The priest became very angry and said: "First, look at that privy over there. When I tell him to practice calligraphy or read sutras, he immediately runs to the privy. At first I wondered what he was doing, but he tears at the walls, breaks off the lath strips, and destroys the privy like that, making it like relieving oneself in an open field. Please imagine my difficulties. When I have him cook the morning and evening rice, look how he hits the edges of the pots and cauldrons with the ladle against the kettle when cooking the rice. Like this," he said, producing fourteen or fifteen broken ladles, "while seeking ladles, there's nothing to be done."

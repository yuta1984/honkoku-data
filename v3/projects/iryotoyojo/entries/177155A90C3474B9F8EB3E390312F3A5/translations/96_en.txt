"During the night, this patient's entire body will become itchy, but he must absolutely not scratch it. When the itching becomes extremely severe, he will lose consciousness. At that time, use Sōkōgan (Aromatic Pills for Resuscitation) with Dokujintō (Ginseng Decoction). I will come tomorrow morning," and he returned home. The next morning he came early and said, "I will use needles to draw out the pus, so prepare something to wipe with." No one understood what he meant and, while puzzled, brought out something like a furoshiki cloth. "This won't do," he said, and had them bring out things like a basin and yukatas. Then he said, "Prepare the Dokujintō decoction," removed the plaster he had applied, and inserted a needle. The pus shot up toward the sky with a sound, and around the sickbed - front, back, left, and right - it was like heavy rain dripping. At this time he used the Dokujintō to support the patient's vital energy, and when the pus flow finally stopped, he wiped it clean and pressed two or three places on the patient's body, asking "Does the patient feel pain?" "It hurts," came the reply. "There is still pus remaining," he said, and again applied plaster to the needle puncture, saying "Tonight it will itch again, but you must absolutely not scratch it. It won't be as bad as last night. I will come tomorrow morning." The next morning he came early and drew out pus, but it was only about one-third of the previous day's amount, and there was no more pus. "The illness is cured," he said and departed. To observe in spring one who will fall ill in autumn, and to discern the cause of illness before it manifests - this probably is not inferior to Bian Que's divination of a person beyond the wall.

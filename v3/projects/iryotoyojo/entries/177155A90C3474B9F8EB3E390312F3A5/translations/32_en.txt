This means that "ma" (麻) refers to hemp seeds and "zu" (豆) refers to adzuki beans. The size of medicine particles should be like the thickness of hemp seeds and adzuki beans. Neither coarse nor fine, but a moderate cutting balance—this is the method of the current school. The old school uses fine powder. However, nowadays, favoring colorful preparations and making them angular is merely showing off to patients.

For decoctions, if too coarse, the medicinal liquid becomes thin; if thin, the medicinal power is weak. If too fine, the medicinal liquid becomes concentrated; if concentrated, it stagnates in the chest and diaphragm. Therefore, neither too thick nor too thin—this also employs the middle way. I believe that regarding water measurement, in recent times, prescription books from Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties mention either "one zhong" or "one zhan." Both zhong and zhan refer to drinking vessels (shang). Flat and shallow ones are called "hai" (cups), while narrow and deep ones are called "zan."

When prescription books simply state "one zhong" or "one zan," it is difficult to measure exactly what size vessel is meant. Dosan's instruction paper states that for the first preparation, put one and a half portions of water in a tenmoku bowl and boil it down to one portion; for the second preparation, put one portion and boil it down to half. This tenmoku refers to tea bowls fired long ago at Mount Tenmoku in Goryeo. Although these come in various sizes, generally those holding eighty me of water were considered standard. Eighty me equals half a kin in Ming dynasty measurement. One kin in Ming equals 160 me. This is called "broad scale" or "large scale." Half a kin is called "half scale" or "small scale." Therefore, half scale is used for water. One cup in a tenmoku bowl equals two go in a Kyoto measure. One go of Kyoto measure holds forty me of pure water. Therefore, one and a half cups in a tenmoku bowl is...

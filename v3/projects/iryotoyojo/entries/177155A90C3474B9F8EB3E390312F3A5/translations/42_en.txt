This is what results from not understanding these principles. While prayer rituals and incantations may have no effect, they cause no harm. However, if medicine is used incorrectly, it can instantly kill a life that was not meant to die. What is truly frightening is the medicine of unlearned doctors. The students say, "Even if prayer rituals cause no harm, there are cases where women, in jealous prayer, visit at the hour of the ox and drive nails into sacred trees. The signs appear and make people ill, often cursing them to death." How about this? Fungetsusai laughs heartily and says, "Even if such things happen, there is absolutely no response. Originally, women rely on such fleeting handiwork, driving nails into sacred trees and hoping for a response, but why would the tree spirit follow their wishes and harm that person? If nails are driven into a standing tree, it would hate the person who did it and instead take revenge on that person. This is called 'returning to the original person' (the consequences return to the doer). Doctors, if they are even slightly careless, may harm people under the pretext of medicine. Around the Tenbun period, there was a masterless samurai living in a back house on Edo's Honcho street. He had one daughter who was extremely beautiful. The landlord had set his heart on her and had long thought to make her his wife, when a wealthy medicine dealer from the Shiba district arranged through a matchmaker to take her as a bride."

There were hardly any medical practitioners. In ancient times, the Emperor would dispatch officials from the Imperial Medical Bureau to the provinces to heal the people's illnesses. Since the Genna era, it has become a peaceful reign where even stable boys who shoe horses learn how to hold a brush, and servants like Kakunai and Kakusuke who blacken their whiskers with ink - it's rare to find those who don't know the iroha syllabary. In such times, those who imitate doctors after seeing kana-annotated versions of "Shūhō Kiku" and "Manbyō Kaishun" somehow shave their heads and don long haori coats, and before you know it, jump into palanquins and vehicles, bustling about day and night, with their descendants scattering like spawning lice throughout the provinces and villages.

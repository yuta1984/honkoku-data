what would we do then? Useless, useless!" He spoke angrily, breaking the discussion with one statement, and the various voices ceased. Ōe no Masafusa composed an elegant verse in his reply letter: "The twin fish can hardly reach the waves of the phoenix pool; how could Bian Que enter the clouds of Jilin?" Thus he displayed our country's reputation. Tsunenobu's insight was the power of talent; Masafusa's elegant verse was the result of broad learning; Genkan's inspiration with the hidden dragon's liver came from his constant specialization in medicine. That Fangyu accepted his wife's words was due to his broad-mindedness. If one were arrogantly stubborn, thinking that peddled medicines could not cure anything and that such matters were not for women to understand, and refused to use them, one would surely lose one's head.

From this we should understand: even quack doctors who call dokushin-tō "rokushin-tō" or call shiso "chisō" sometimes happen to hit the mark. When country folk say it's effective to burn straw joints and attach them to waraji-kui, this follows the principle that "like qi seeks like, like sounds respond to each other." Generally speaking, physicians should be capable in humble matters and know things broadly. That mokuzoku removes eye cataracts follows the principle of polishing; that cicada molts stop night crying is because cicadas don't cry at night. Moreover, there are extraordinary things where materials sympathetically respond to each other. Gripping salt calms the dancing of loaches, gripping testicles stops nosebleeds - one cannot fully comprehend these principles.

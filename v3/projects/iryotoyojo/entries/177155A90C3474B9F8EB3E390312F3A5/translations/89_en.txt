"Then let us pray to the mountain witch," they said, and carried and shouldered her to that rice field. From then on, children with smallpox, people with eye diseases, the deaf, those with bent backs, and even those who crawled on their knees came crawling to pray to the mountain witch. Not only from nearby villages but also from distant villages, retainers from local samurai households - old and young, men and women, high and low in status - came gathering in palanquins and vehicles. They built a shrine, erected a torii gate, named it "Mountain Witch Hall," and day and night the crowds never ceased, with pilgrims coming from neighboring villages and even adjacent provinces.

When the feudal lord heard of this and inquired "What has occurred?" and investigated the origins, it turned out that the so-called mountain witch was actually a young retainer who had committed adultery with a woman from his peer group in the local samurai household. When she became pregnant and could no longer hide it, since the woman had an acquaintance in Echigo, they relied on this connection and the two came to this place together. However, she suddenly went into labor and gave birth in that rice field, immediately abandoning the baby at a place called Tsubata Gate, and the couple went to seek out the acquaintance in Echigo.

But this person was not a relative but merely a childhood friend of the woman, whom she had counted on. Due to the woman's thoughtlessness - having given birth in that village and having the child cast into a river - the friend shunned and despised them, making it impossible to stay in Echigo. When they fled toward the capital region, they were not allowed to pass through the checkpoint in the capital region.

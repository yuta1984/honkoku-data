There are masters of extraordinary skill living among the weeds and grass. Poor scholars should not perspire on summer days, so the talent to not be bound by the fixed idea that Maōtō (Ephedra Decoction) is a prohibited medicine in summer, and the ability to respond flexibly to circumstances, are beyond what hired doctors can achieve. When people of the world specialize in ugly popular doctors (like "cat-faced, nose-missing monkeys"), it is because those who take medicine are limitless - this is exactly what this saying means.

At that time, the mountain god jumped out and shouted: "I want you to stop Fungetsusai's lectures that are like stretching straw mats across the sky and ropes across the sea (impossibly ambitious endeavors)! In a world that specializes in hypothetical examples, important patients must be taught about popular doctors, and to prevent people from talking, one must first employ popular doctors. Even learned doctors cannot cure one hundred out of one hundred patients. That the rice merchant fell in love with a surgeon during the first horse day pilgrimage in spring - isn't this the divine will that preserves life? That popular doctors massacre everyone - isn't this also divine will? All your discourse is nothing but a woman's universal jealousy (unreasonable envy)!" With this outburst, Fungetsusai was left speechless.

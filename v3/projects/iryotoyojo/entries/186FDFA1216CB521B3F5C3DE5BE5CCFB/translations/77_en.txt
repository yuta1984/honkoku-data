The renowned actors Kashiwaguruma and Shinsui both became deceased within two years, and the theater seemed somehow unsatisfying, with public enthusiasm waning like "what to do about Ikaho's marsh."

In all human affairs, fortune and misfortune are like the old man of Sai's horse. We are born naked and die naked as well. Though we say "drink and sing," when we hear the cry of silent crows in the darkness just ahead, we long for money not yet found.

As people living in such times, we are grateful for the abundant blessings of our benevolent ruler.

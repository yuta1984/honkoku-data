Having finished writing "Ichikawa Hakusha," at the age of forty-four as his final moment,
on the second day of the fourth month of Meiwa 4 (1767), year of the boar, at the hour of the rat's latter quarter, he passed away peacefully as if falling asleep.
Everyone was in a dreamlike state, overcome with grief
beyond comprehension, a sight too painful to behold. Then, as was
natural, they conducted the funeral procession to the graveyard,
and since there was a temple connection, he was buried at Jōrinji Temple in Shitaya,
with the posthumous name Rengein Eikō Shinji inscribed. Though the stone marker will not
decay, there were no sleeves that did not decay from the rain of tears
shed by those who held him dear.

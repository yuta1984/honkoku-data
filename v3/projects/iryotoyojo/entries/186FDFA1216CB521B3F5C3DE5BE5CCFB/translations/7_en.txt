The Tetsumon-ya's catering service is so shrewd that even mustard miso penetrates to the nostrils. For spring bamboo shoots, they provide lamp wicks to barren women; for lotus roots like inkstone lids, they remove the floor joists of paradise with dead hands' yams, Sanzu River trout, frozen jelly from the eight cold hells, and Jizo grilling from the western riverbank - all according to preference and as much as one can drink. From nightfall onward, crowds of people gather. "These are this region's specialties," they say, paying money for the salt of words. Even those who find sweetness in this bitter floating world return home when evening ends, leaving behind only human voices and the sound of waves. In the deepening midnight's gentle breeze, plants and trees naturally nod in slumber. In the distant dark path where starlight dimly shines, voices cry out.

Since hell and paradise began, what master's elopement search has put us in such difficulty!"

There was also an iroegoto-shi (romantic lead actor) named Bandō Hikosaburō Shinsui. He was the real son of the previous Hikosaburō, with the childhood name Kikumatsu. After his father Shinsui became a guest of the underworld (died), Kikumatsu inherited his father's name and became the second-generation Hikosaburō. Originally, his father Hikosaburō was born in Kuretake village in Fushimi and was also of samurai status, but for certain reasons became an actor. Even on stage he specialized in martial arts, and with his "true reality" style of performance, he was celebrated as a genuine master. With the dignity of a chief retainer, there were no other actors of his caliber in those days. However, when Shinsui reached forty, he grieved over having no children.

Following someone's advice, he went to the dragon god of the Sumida River and prayed through twenty-one nights of vigil. The child born from these prayers was none other than the later Shinsui. Truly, like a chick whose voice surpasses all other birds even from within the egg, Shinsui from his child actor days had strong charm and drew large audiences in wakashū-gata roles, moving the hearts of monks, laypeople, men and women alike. Not only fans, toothpick cases, tobacco pouches, songs, and haiku, but even when Shinsui merely touched something with ink, the joy of girls and children surpassed even the calligraphy of Wang Xizhi or the poetry cards of Teika. While his father emphasized mastering solid techniques, the later Shinsui was from the beginning renowned as an iroegoto-shi on stage.

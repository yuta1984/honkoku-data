Because I don't want to make your son's filial piety meaningless, I traveled six ri to Kyoto without sleeping from evening through the night. Since he's a master I've long been on good terms with, I've arranged everything beforehand, so if you just agree, I'll hand over the money."

I would have no excuse before my ancestors, and would be lower than dogs and cats. Even if I must chew sand and starve to death, this absolutely cannot be allowed." This was his understandable response.

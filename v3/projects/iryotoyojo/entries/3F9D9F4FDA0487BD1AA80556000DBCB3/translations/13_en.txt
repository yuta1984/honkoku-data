The Great Dharma Master said, "I shall return you all to your home country," and leaning against Mount Fuji, he straddled Lake Biwa in Omi Province, placed the boat on his palm, and blew "whoosh" with his breath. A tremendous tailwind arose, and in an instant they arrived at Toba Port. Everyone rejoiced at meeting their wives and children again. All were in good health - how auspicious, how auspicious!

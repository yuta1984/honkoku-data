When still no decision could be reached, Omoikane-no-kami, the ancestor of Chikamatsu, stepped forward and declared: "By no other means will her divine mood be restored. Since the Great Goddess always favors kyōgen theater, if we begin performing kyōgen in front of the rock cave, she will surely open the cave door." Everyone said, "This is extremely reasonable. This seems like a plan that will surely succeed," and so they began selecting actors. First, for the leading male role (tachiyaku) in aragoto style, with horn-shaped hair (mizura) as the star performer: Tajikarao-no-kami. For tanzzen robes, choreographed pieces, humble roles, and romantic leads: Ame-no-Koyane-no-mikoto. For the villain role: Futotama-no-mikoto. Most notably, the famous black-haired supreme courtesan of that time for wife and daughter roles, and the pinnacle of young female impersonators (wakonnagata) for all choreographed pieces: Ame-no-Uzume-no-mikoto. In addition, from regular performers to newcomers, the entire troupe would appear, with a poster announcing "We shall perform through the fourth act for your viewing pleasure." When word spread that tomorrow would be the face-showing performance (kaomise), spectators crowded in like mountains. From inside the theater to the gates of the tea houses, lanterns bearing the family crests of various patrons shone like stars. They planted five hundred sacred sakaki trees from Mount Amenokagu to decorate the scene, and as they drank soup made from the eternal long-crowing birds of the eternal world, it felt as though the world of eternal darkness had dawned. The gods became excited and arranged their various offerings, dividing into heavenly deity and earthly deity groups on left and right, decorating with flowers and displaying the utmost splendor, though dawn seemed nowhere in sight.

Kagu-hana flared his nostrils, and the other attendants in the assembly—Gozu-mezu (Ox-head Horse-head) and Ahō-rasetsu (Foolish demons)—raised the horns on their foreheads, and their voices of admiration would not cease. King Enma inadvertently opened his eyes to look, and his heart was moved by this supremely elegant and beautiful woman. His initial laughter disappeared, and he became utterly dazed like the empty shell of a cicada, unknowingly tumbling from his jeweled throne. When everyone was startled and helped him up, he finally came to his senses, let out a deep sigh, and said:

"Truly, though I have no face to show before everyone watching, I was unexpectedly captivated by the gracefulness of this painted figure. What behavior of mine, like Henshō's poetry! Now, reflecting deeply, while beautiful women renowned since ancient times are countless, among them there is none who could compare. Xi Shi's gaze, Ono no Komachi's eyebrows, Yang Guifei's lips, Princess Kaguya's nose bridge, Zhao Feiyan's waistline, Princess Sotōri's manner of wearing clothes—this figure combines all of these. To say 'paulownia is the guardian hall, mountain lily is in her maiden prime' and such about wild pinks is merely ordinary. She seems beyond comparison to flowers, moon, or even bodhisattvas. Moreover, since such a being could never be born twice in the lands of China or Japan, I too shall abandon my throne in the underworld and go forth to the mortal world to share a pillow with this one."

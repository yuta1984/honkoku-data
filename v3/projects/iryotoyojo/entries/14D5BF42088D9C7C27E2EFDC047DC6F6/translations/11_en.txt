Ushiwaka was taken by tengu, there was Sōka Hijiri's Narihira, Emperor Go-Daigo's Kumawaka, Nobunaga's Ranmaru, and the famous Mongaku of Takao who was infatuated with Rokudai and encouraged unnecessary rebellion, and from when he received Yoritomo's censure, the phrase "buttocks coming" began in the mortal world. The reason many people go for hot spring cures to Kinosaki in Tajima and Sokokura in Hakone is all because of this male homosexuality. Perhaps because in the old days only monks indulged in this, the character for "hemorrhoids" (痔) is written with the sickness radical and the character for "temple" (寺).

The imperial command was issued: "From now on, male homosexuality shall be strictly prohibited in the mortal world," and everyone respectfully accepted with "Yes!"

This is ultimately because the Great King dislikes young men, like forcing a sake lover to close his rice cake shop

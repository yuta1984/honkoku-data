"If we fail, the curse would be having to dredge the Sanzu River or repair Paradise - in recent years, goldfish and silver fish are generally unable to manage such tasks, being pressured by red carp from all directions, and even the world's tuna are as impoverished as whitebait in these difficult times, so it would be extremely troublesome. If his anger is strong, we would be driven from this underwater realm to who knows where. If we were to be demoted to somewhere within the Thirty-three Heavens, we would all become dried fish along the way, so this is no trivial matter but a great crisis. We must quickly devise a plan to capture Kikunosuke," was his proclamation. A whale sitting in the highest seat calmly rose and spoke: "As you say, our lord's great crisis is upon us. Though I am unworthy, due to my family lineage I have served as chief elder for generations. The crocodiles and sharks sitting alongside me also hold positions as senior retainers, while the yellowtail and tuna serve as assistants. After consulting privately with them, we concluded that without first learning detailed information about the human world, no stratagem could succeed. Therefore, we have secretly dispatched some clever subordinates as spies, so we should surely learn the situation soon." Before he could finish speaking, someone came tumbling out, jet black and rolling about, crying "Urgent report!" - it was the Narihira clam that lived around Honjo.

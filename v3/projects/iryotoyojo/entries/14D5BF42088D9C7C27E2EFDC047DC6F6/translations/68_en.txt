Though my dying to save you would fulfill my deepest wish, if I die and am immediately reborn in a wretched form, surely you would become disgusted with me. Moreover, while people of this world promise to be united in the afterlife after death, you will receive the favor of the King of Hell, while I will pathetically fall into the realm of beasts, making it difficult for us to meet again. Thinking our bond so thin, the water in my chest will not dissolve. If you would but offer even a single prayer from your lips after my death, surely the sufferings of the next life would be lightened.

Moreover, just because I hear that the King of Hell favors me does not mean I can escape.

"I will command them to quickly capture and present him to ease Your Imperial Majesty's heart," came the response as if it were nothing at all. The Great King was even more delighted and declared: "Then until Kikunojō arrives, I shall seclude myself in the inner palace and have the celestial beings play the shamisen to console myself. During this time, even if sinners appear, I shall generally turn away the light offenders and first throw the serious criminals into the holding area at the crossroads of the six realms. As for that monk from earlier who gave his body to Kikunojō—at first I thought it hateful, but compared to my own heart, it is something that would be natural for a young person, so he shall be returned to the mortal world again. However, hereafter, purchasing Kikunojō shall be forbidden. Benzō, Matsusuke, Kikuji and others, as well as all others up to and including those at Yushima Shinmei, are granted permission." With this imperial decree, the curtain was swiftly drawn, so the Dragon King returned to the water palace, and everyone withdrew.

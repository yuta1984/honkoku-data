The Dragon King spoke loudly: "Even though they are mere lowly servants, this is an extremely urgent matter, so we shall hear them directly." The clam respectfully opened its shell and spoke: "I was given the secret mission to the human world, measured into a bamboo basket, carried on someone's shoulder, and traveled around various places to observe the general situation of the human world. The places I passed through were primarily the new roads and back alleys of various districts, so I know nothing of the grand avenues where daimyo reside or the main thoroughfares. At the first place I visited, I don't know what happened exactly, but the man carrying me called out 'Fifteen mon per sho!' Then a woman of about thirty came out and said 'Reduce it by five mon!' The man carrying me got angry and said 'That's preposterous! These aren't stolen goods - I wouldn't sell them for that price even if half were just shells!' He spoke harshly and started to leave. Behind him, the woman, despite having such a pretty face, could be faintly heard shouting back: 'I thought so - how disagreeable! You fool, save such foul language for your own wife!' Even though her angry voice could be heard, the man carrying me pretended not to hear and continued selling, calling 'Clams! Clams!' Then, from inside a latticed house, came the twangy sound of a runny-nosed girl playing the shamisen. In our Dragon Palace realm, I thought instruments like the koto and shamisen were only playthings for professional entertainers, yet here in such modest circumstances they have daughters playing the shamisen - truly, what extravagant creatures these humans are!"

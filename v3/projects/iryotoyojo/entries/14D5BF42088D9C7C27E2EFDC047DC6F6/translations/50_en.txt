Generally speaking, in ancient times people were simple and pure, so they understood that poisonous things should not be eaten, and regarded pufferfish as they would snakes and scorpions. But gradually people's hearts became dissolute, and there are those who eat pufferfish knowing it to be poisonous. The ruler was concerned about this and established laws making family extinction the penalty for dying from eating pufferfish. However, "though those above favor benevolence, those below do not favor righteousness," and people walk the main streets selling "fugu" and openly display it in food stalls. This shows extreme contempt for authority. To lose the body, hair, and skin received from one's parents for the sake of satisfying one's appetite - among the three thousand types of the five punishments, no sin is greater than filial impiety, according to the teachings of the sages. To go against this is not something Heaven takes lightly. Moreover, when pufferfish is unavailable, naming other fish "fugu-like" and eating them is truly lamentable. As the ancients said, "Draw a prison and do not sit within it" - even nominally, one should avoid defiled names. Those ignorant commoners who do not know the principle "see no impropriety, hear no impropriety" cannot be helped. Among men of some learning, or doctors who teach others about handling poisons, there are those who enjoy eating it. These people are just like dogs and cats that devour food indiscriminately. Given such corrupted customs, Kikunojo probably also likes pufferfish, but speaking in terms of Heaven's timing, it is now the sixth month

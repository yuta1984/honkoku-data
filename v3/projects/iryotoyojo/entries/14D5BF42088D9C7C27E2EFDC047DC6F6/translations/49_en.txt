When no one volunteered saying "I shall go," the sound of a bell came from the back, and someone appeared with a most graceful figure. Looking at this being with high cheeks, a small nose, short stature, and a swollen belly, it was unmistakably a pufferfish serving as an attendant to Princess Otohime.

Standing without any sign of hesitation in the middle of where various dignitaries were seated, the pufferfish bowed respectfully before the Dragon King and said: "Having listened to all the deliberations from the beginning, I understand that everyone is troubled about this important mission. The Dragon King's concerns are quite reasonable, but laughable as it may be, though I am but a princess's attendant and this is presumptuous, let me offer my thoughts. People always call me 'poison, poison' as if I were some gardener's daughter, and when I get angry and puff up my cheeks, they laugh and call me 'Ofuku.' Misfortune lasts three years, but having heard of this mission, out of loyalty to my lord, I will sacrifice my hundred years of life, leap into Kikunojo's belly and bring him here. I truly, truly have confidence in my heart." So saying, she bared her white teeth and pursed her lips.

The Dragon King appeared to be pondering this. Then a spiny fish that had been waiting nearby straightened its fins and slowly stepped forward, saying: "Though I may appear knowledgeable in speaking thus, I never miss ceremonial occasions and am counted among the scholars for knowing something of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. To hold back at such a time would be occupying a position without merit, so I shall speak without concealment."

The human desire for money is the same in China and Japan, in ancient times and today, never changing. Even sages cleverly say "study and fortune will be found therein" to get their share. Buddha takes on a golden form to make people desire him, and without initial offerings, even Shinto's spiritual power cannot be relied upon. All of this makes money the enemy of the world. One day, a lending library owner came to me with a request. When I inquired into its source, this fellow too was an old man whose greedy sickness had penetrated to his vital organs. To cure this, acupuncture and medicine would be of no avail. When I tried to admonish him using Confucianism, he said, "Did the sages not eat food?" When I used Shinto teachings, he said, "It's difficult to be honest when poor." When I used Buddhism, he said, "The present matters more than the future. I beg you, first give me hooks and rope to hang my family's mouths from the ceiling, and then I'll receive your teachings." Having no words in reply, I immediately took up my brush and wrote this piece.

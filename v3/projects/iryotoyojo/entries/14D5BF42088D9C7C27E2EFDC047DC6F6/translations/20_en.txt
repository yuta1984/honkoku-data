The Ten Kings, having exhausted their strategies, said: "Now our wisdom has reached its limits. At this point, we should send an envoy to the Asura realm and summon military strategists like Taigongwang, Zhuge Liang, Han Xin, Zhang Liang, Sun Tzu, Wu Zi, Takenori, Yoshitsune, Masashige, and Toki for consultation." Then, from the lowest seat emerged something with an extremely red face, eyes shining like mirrors, a mouth split from ear to ear, having a head but no body. Upon seeing this, it was revealed to be the one called "Yokome-yaku Mirume" (Side-Glance Official Watching Eye), who observes people's entire lives and records them in ledgers. He stepped forward before King Enma and said: "While everyone's deliberations are quite reasonable, sending people to the Asura realm and summoning military strategists for such matters would be a disgrace to this realm. Moreover, if their wisdom and stratagems see through our intelligence, what schemes might they devise? If the hell realm, which has been peaceful since the Sayoarashi incident, were to become chaotic again, it would cause difficulties from King Enma above down to the prison guards below. Therefore, inviting military advisors would be unnecessary. My role is to stand beside humans and correct good and evil, so I clearly know what people think in their hearts. I have long known that Kikunojō and other actors show signs of going on a pleasure boat excursion. If you take advantage of this opportunity to scheme, wouldn't it easily fall into your hands?"

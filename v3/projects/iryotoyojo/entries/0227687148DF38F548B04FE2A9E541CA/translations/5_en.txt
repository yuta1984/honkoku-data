Shian-gusa (Contemplation Grass) and Funbetsu-sō (Discernment Grass): When encountering various matters that require contemplation and discernment, if one smokes tobacco during this process, good ideas may emerge. Perhaps these names derive from this meaning.

Chōmei (Longevity), Enmei (Life Extension), Enju (Longevity), Keiki (Celebration), Jōraku (Constant Joy), Eiraku (Eternal Joy), Tokiwa (Evergreen), Yōki (Nurturing Energy), Chōgi (Long Enjoyment), Aien (Beloved Smoke), Kan'yū (Leisurely Friend) - all of these are probably honorific names forcibly given by people who love and enjoy tobacco.

Rōtō (Henbane): This is listed in Volume 17 of the Honzō Kōmoku (Compendium of Materia Medica) in the section on poisonous plants, with detailed annotations. Other medical texts also discuss this plant. The Wakan Sansai Zue (Japanese-Chinese Illustrated Encyclopedia) also provides detailed commentary. In all cases, this is a different plant from tobacco. Rōtō is a poisonous plant called "ōmiru grass." Who mistakenly uses this as the Chinese characters for tobacco? Even dictionaries today make this error. Neither the Shōjitsū nor dictionaries contain the Japanese reading for tobacco. I would like to hear from learned people if they have evidence.

Taihei-sō (Great Peace Grass): Upon consideration, most theories say tobacco arrived during the Keichō period.

Perhaps this celebratory name derives from this meaning of celebrating great peace under heaven. If so, it is a particularly auspicious title.

Smoking Pipe (Kiseru)
Upon investigation, when tobacco first arrived, there was no such thing as a kiseru. People simply wrapped tobacco in paper, making it like a flute or hichiriki reed instrument to smoke it. When wrapping it in paper, half the paper would be used to wrap the tobacco thickly, and half would be wrapped thinly with just paper. They would light it and inhale from the thin end. Alternatively, they would shave thin bamboo or reeds and pack tobacco into the shaved end to smoke it. Later...

　　　　Benefits and Costs
A certain book states that in ancient times, there was no shortage even without tobacco. Even smoking much of it does not amount to a handful of food. It wastes fields and reduces grain production, hence it is called "poverty grass." However, nowadays in mountainous and wild areas where fierce beasts ravage the fields, planting tobacco eliminates concerns about crop damage, and for the purpose of paying annual tribute, it rather provides profit. If this is so, perhaps China also has this logic? Logic cannot be determined in a blanket manner. Generally speaking, because tobacco flourishes greatly in the world, from tobacco pipes, tobacco pouches, tobacco trays, tobacco cutters, middlemen, wholesalers, to producers - how many tens of thousands of people make their living from this?

It has four functions: First, when sober, it can intoxicate well. This is because the fire qi steams through exterior and interior, penetrating all, like drinking alcohol. Second, when intoxicated, it can sober well. This is because when sipped after drinking, it relaxes the qi, moves down phlegm, and the remaining intoxication is immediately resolved. Third, when hungry, it can satisfy well. Fourth, when sated, it can make hungry well. This is because when smoked on an empty stomach, one feels full and vigorous as if satisfied. When consumed after being full, food and drink are consumed pleasantly and digest easily. Some say it benefits the head and eyes, resolves wind-cold, expels malignant qi, and [protects against] mountain mists and miasma...

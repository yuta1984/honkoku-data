Kyōka (Comic Verse)

In recent times, among the tobacco that has emerged, it has never ceased and now flourishes greatly, in both China and Japan
Know this well - the auspiciousness of this peaceful reign is such that even nobles smoke tobacco
Tobacco, even varieties from their original sources, when planted in all directions have different fragrances and qualities
The fragrance and names of tobacco produced in each province vary according to location
Planted in spring and harvested in autumn, this tobacco - after snow passes, its taste becomes mild
Making the common people eagerly smoke, tobacco is said to rise even above the clouds
Though not the shores where fishermen burn fires, tobacco smokers form rows like the tidal flats
Everyone becomes a smoker - though I too once disliked tobacco
Once one develops a taste for tobacco, it cannot be stopped, and this is the same in both China and Japan
Some like sake, some are big eaters who like rice cakes, some like tobacco, and some still like tea
Those who interfere are bothersome - the tea gets cold, the pipe gets clogged, the host is troubled

Listen well - though the tobacco fire is small as a firefly, if you let your guard down, it becomes the voice of alarm bells
Even what has good fragrance should be avoided and feared before gods and Buddha, you Shinto priests and Buddhist monks
People of the world, day and night without distinction, below their noses - eating rice, drinking tea, drinking sake and smoking tobacco
Shall we see it as flowers, rising like mist? When people's hearts are captivated by tobacco's fragrance and appearance
Seeing nobles smoking in secret, what interesting thoughts this brings to mind
Though tobacco is merely the work of a bit of smoke, there is no day it ceases in any commoner's household
During long nights of contemplation, this tobacco becomes a companion even in bedroom leisure
In loneliness, holding a pipe and going outside to look, everyone alike is smoking tobacco
Warriors pursuing and striking, crows in their work, holding back their horses thinking to cut
The blown smoke rises like clouds, becoming dragons - who knows where in the vast sky above
Rain falls, tobacco gets wet, fire goes out, stomachs are empty - what a situation
The tobacco smoker who never lets go of his pipe - even the fish are exasperated and fed up

Great Eating
From then on, the two traveled together. At a shop called Manemon, they ate about twenty steamed buns and rested while continuing to eat heartily. For breakfast at their Totsuka lodging, they ate seven or eight bowls, and unable to wait for lunch at Enoshima, they had bonito as sashimi, eating two helpings without even greeting anyone. They ate three grilled mackerel, ordered shellfish to be grilled, and thinking that even black sea bream would be fine if made into clear soup, they intended to eat as much as they wanted.

Jūichihei said, "My, my, today is quite clear," to which Fuguman replied, "It's nothing, just ordinary sunshine. Light stuff."

That night they stayed at Yukinoshita. Jūichihei asked, "Yesterday you accepted the challenge and called yourself a competitor - what brings you to this?" The man replied, "We don't eat that much, just nibbling here and there, with no particular preferences. Our teacher doesn't much care for butterflies. As for Tenya's soba noodles, probably no one can match us. Since one bowl is just one mouthful for us, it's quite amusing. Please do visit us sometime when you're nearby," and he told him the location.

Then [Jūichihei] thought that since his own teacher was also a soba eater, perhaps there might be some connection after all.

Great Eating

Now, knowing that there are indeed two masters of great soba eating, and wanting to determine which is superior to resolve the disciples' concerns, Kisōhachi sought connections through Tōichihei, and with Nihachi's disciple Ichirikuemon serving as intermediary, they agreed to a soba eating contest where the loser would become subordinate to the winner. Since this involves the famous Kenchin-jiji, whom everyone knows as a great eater, they naturally couldn't settle it easily, so they set a date limit. After exchanging greetings with Kisōhachi's side, it was decided that the date for the contest would be determined very soon.

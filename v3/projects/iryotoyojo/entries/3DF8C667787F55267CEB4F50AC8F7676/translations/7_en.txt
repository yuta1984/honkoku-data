Great Eating
Here there is also another tremendous soba eater called Nihachi. Because he eats Tenya's soba-kiri so ferociously, everyone calls him "Kendon-jiji" (the stubborn old man). When two or three people gather to buy soba, it's like a ritual ceremony for lovers' suicide; if they were merchants, they would carry it in like a store inventory or final delivery. Though he has many disciples, none can quite match him, so naturally Kisōhachi tries to imitate his master.

If you rank people's favorite foods, they all work quite hard at it. When someone says, "Yesterday I ate a whole large pot of turnips in fugu soup with great gusto," he's praised with "Well done!" When another says, "Last night I went elsewhere and ate twelve bowls of sōmen," he's told "That's not very impressive." When someone says, "I eat my night meal and come right away," he serves up fourteen bowls of tanko soup piled up like a mountain.

When told "You gave me [those bowls]," he's praised with "Given your skill with New Year's soup the other day, that would be expected," and everyone spurs each other on, not wanting to be outdone.

I heard recently that there was a hand-made soba gathering. The reputation is that probably no one can match that master, he says.

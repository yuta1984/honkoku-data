【Diagram of the Square Root Method】
Place 3 next to 20 in the quotient, lower the bottom method by one place, double 20 to make 40 and place it there. Place 3 below this as well. Now using the method, multiply the bottom method by 3 from the quotient: 2×3 equals 600, 3×4 equals 120. When placing 3×3 equals 9, there are 729 tsubo in the method. This is to be subtracted from the dividend. Now looking at the quotient, it becomes 123 ken.

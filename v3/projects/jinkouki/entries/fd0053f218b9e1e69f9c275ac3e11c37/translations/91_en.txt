[Problem 24] When arranging one million cavalry in ranks of two people per ken (unit of length), how long would the line extend?

○ The answer is 231 ri, 17 chō, and 20 ken
Note: 1 ken equals 6 shaku 5 sun, 1 chō equals 60 ken, 1 ri equals 36 chō

Dividing one million people by two gives 500,000 ken.
Dividing this by 60 ken gives 8,333 chō and 20 ken. Dividing this by 36 chō gives a total length of 231 ri, 17 chō, and 20 ken.

▲ If the above one million people were given daily rations of 5 gō per person, how much would be needed per day?
　　　　5,000 koku of rice would be required

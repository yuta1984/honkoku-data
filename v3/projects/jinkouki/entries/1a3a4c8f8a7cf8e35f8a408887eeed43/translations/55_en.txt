▲A six-panel folding screen with height of 6 shaku and width of 2 shaku 1 sun. When placing 3-sun gold leaf entirely within the borders, how many pieces of leaf are needed?
《Marginal note: 3-sun leaf》The answer is 752 pieces, 8 bu 8 rin.

[Figure begins_Screen illustration]
[Upper frame] 2 shaku 1 sun
[Oze] Height 5 shaku 6 sun
[Figure ends]

First, multiply 2 shaku 1 sun by 6 to get 1 jō 2 shaku 6 sun. From this, subtract 5 sun for the vertical frames on both sides, leaving 1 jō 2 shaku 1 sun.
Multiply by the height of 5 shaku 6 sun to get 6,776 tsubo. Divide this by 9 tsubo (the area of one 3-sun leaf) to get 752 pieces, 8 bu 8 rin.

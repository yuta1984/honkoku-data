　　Initial diagram

Set the actual area as 15,129 tsubo. Then, below the tsubo position, place the auxiliary number (lian) as 1, and ascend by two places each: ones, tens, ones, tens. When examining in this manner, upon reaching below the ten-thousands place, it appears as one place, so place 1 in the quotient. This represents 100 ken. Now multiply the auxiliary 1 by the quotient as 1×1=1, and place 1 in the divisor. With this divisor 1 and quotient 1, multiply again as 1×1=1, and subtract 10,000 tsubo from the dividend. There remain 5,129 tsubo in the dividend.

Now, to examine the divisor, multiply the auxiliary by the quotient again and add to the divisor. The divisor becomes 2 and moves down one row. The auxiliary moves down two rows.

【Main Text】
When calling 100, it becomes 10,000 tsubo. Divide this from the dividend, and there remains in the dividend
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　〽5,120 tsubo remaining

　　　　　　　　　Place 20 next to 100 in the quotient. For the lower divisor, move down one place, double 100 to make 200, and place this. Below this, place 20 again. Now using the divisor method, call the quotient's 20 with the lower divisor's 220. 2×2=4,000, 2×2=400. Subtract this 4,400 from the dividend.
　　　　　　　　　　〽729 tsubo remain in the dividend

　　　　　　　　　Place 3 next to 20 in the quotient. For the lower divisor, move down one place, double 20 to make 40, and place this. Below this, place 3 again. Now using the divisor method, call the lower divisor with the quotient's 3. 2×3=600 tsubo, 3×4=120 tsubo, 3×3=9 tsubo. When placed, there are 729 tsubo in the divisor. Subtract this from the dividend. Now looking at the quotient　〽It becomes 123 ken per side

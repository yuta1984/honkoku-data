There are rumors about whether they should be sent back and expelled, and what Lord Gaiki thinks about this matter.

Regarding the matter that they did not bring信牌 (trading permits) and did not report to us here, I hear that this does not align with Lord Gaiki's intentions. According to the previous written instructions, they are to be expelled. I report this matter as stated above.

Reply from Lord Tamba-no-kami

I have sent communications to my retainers. Regarding the Chinese ship that drifted to Kishi-ura in Lord Hizen-no-kami's domain, about which you informed me earlier, after conducting written dialogue with them, I learned that it was a ship that came to this port for trade. Since this is a ship without信牌 (trading permits), Watanabe Gaiki's office should handle the discussions. I have discussed the details with Tokunaga Yajiemon's office, so I cannot provide further specifics. With utmost respect and fear

1. Upon arriving in Nagasaki, regarding consulting with Tokunaga Yajiemon and going out to serve Lords Tamba-no-kami and Gaiki: Takagi Zenemon has been informed of this, and based on that, Yajiemon should accompany him when going out. We are therefore preparing and sending oral presentation documents to both lords. Since the content of the oral presentation documents to both lords differs, there may be occasions when both lords will privately review copies of the oral presentation documents through Yajiemon. This point should also be discussed with Yajiemon so he can confirm with Zenemon. Regarding this, we are preparing and sending four copies of the oral presentation documents in total.

1. Regarding the aforementioned drifted ship, when Lords Tamba-no-kami and Gaiki give instructions that it is no longer necessary to send it to Nagasaki and to have it depart directly, we have prepared two copies of an inquiry memorandum on separate paper and are giving them to you. Of course, if the instructions are to send it to Nagasaki or to expel it, then this inquiry is naturally unnecessary.

1. When you serve both lords and the content of their instructions is determined, consult with Yajiemon and report back by express courier. Of course, if there are complicated matters that are difficult to understand from written correspondence alone, Seibee should return as quickly as possible to report.

1. If Lord Mimasaka is still staying there, please report these circumstances to him in detail. Regarding the guard captains, please arrange for Yajiemon to inform them in passing.

1. For when Lords Tamba-no-kami and Gaiki inquire about the circumstances of this drifted ship, the appearance of the ship, etc., we are preparing and sending a separate memorandum for your reference when making responses. Additionally, for your reference, we have added to this memorandum the circumstances of sending the Ningbo ship that drifted to Karatome the year before last to Nagasaki.

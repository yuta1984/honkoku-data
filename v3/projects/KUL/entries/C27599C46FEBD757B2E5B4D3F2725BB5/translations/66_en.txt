It was conveyed that expulsion measures must be carried out, and since one official document was handed over and sent, we have communicated accordingly. If there is no discrepancy with the six articles mentioned in the said document, you were instructed to submit a written statement accordingly. However, since it is difficult to determine whether there is truly no discrepancy with this content, we should first report to headquarters here, and if there is no discrepancy, we will submit the document according to instructions from here. Otherwise, we should thoroughly investigate here and send the document. Understanding this, the official document was received and sent. Therefore, we are sending the response to the said official document in a separate written statement, which you should take to Lord Gaiki and present.

Regarding communicating the content of the above response to Lord Gaiki, how would it be if nothing is communicated to Lord Tamba-no-kami? We understand the instruction that if credentials are not brought, the usual measures should be taken. The current ship is from Garoupa, and they responded that they have not received information about the credentials. Details were reported by express message on the 12th, and written conversation records were also submitted at that time. Please arrange to report that we are waiting for further instructions.

Regarding what was mentioned in a recent letter about two walking inspectors inquiring by letter about the drifting Chinese ship on the 3rd - this was also reported to our headquarters, and it was stated that a written report would be submitted later. Understanding this, we have also prepared a response letter in a separate document, so please communicate this to both officials. With utmost respect and humble words.

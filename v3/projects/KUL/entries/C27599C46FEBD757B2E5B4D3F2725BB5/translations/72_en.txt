Report

1. Regarding the matter of dispatching Takagi Zenemon to Nagasaki: although there were instructions to expel the drifted Chinese ship, unlike malicious drifted ships, given the nature of previous drifted ships, expelling this one might result in making an error. Although this matter should have been communicated through a messenger, it was previously instructed that Zenemon should discuss with Takagi Sakuemon to have him thoroughly report this to Lord Tamba-no-kami through unofficial channels in advance. The details are contained in the official Edo correspondence submitted on August 21st.

Extract from a letter brought by Zenemon from the senior retainers to Tokunaga Yajiemon

We have reviewed your letter from the 15th. The acknowledgment clauses are omitted.

1. Regarding this drifted ship, there are no illegal matters, yet concerning the expulsion, we are concerned that perhaps mistakes might be made. To communicate this matter to Takagi Sakuemon, I have instructed Takagi Zenemon and am sending this today. Zenemon will report the details, so I will not elaborate further. Additionally, regarding this matter, we plan to dispatch messenger Ito Seibee tomorrow to make further inquiries with Lord Tamba-no-kami and Lord Gaiki. Above.

August 19th

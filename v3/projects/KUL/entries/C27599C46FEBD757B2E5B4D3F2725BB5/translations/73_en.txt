From the senior retainers to Takagi Sakuemon's residence, as follows:

I respectfully write this letter. We are pleased to hear that you continue to perform your duties with steadfast dedication. Now, regarding the Chinese ship that drifted ashore at Kishiura in our domain, when we inquired with Lord Tamba-no-kami and Lord Gaiki, we learned that since this is a ship that arrived without holding proper credentials (shinpai), it would be difficult to conduct proper deliberations even if we were to escort it to that port. Moreover, since Lord Gaiki is in charge of expulsion matters, it would certainly be Lord Gaiki who would issue the orders. Lord Tamba-no-kami informed Tokunaga Yajiemon of this. Lord Gaiki stated that, as mentioned above, regarding this ship without proper credentials, if there are no instructions from the magistrate concerning its transfer, we should understand that it should be expelled. This drifted Chinese ship differs from malicious drifting vessels - it appears to be a ship that was compelled to drift ashore due to unfavorable sea conditions, as has happened before, and there are no illegal matters involved. However, we are concerned that expelling it might result in some procedural error. Therefore, we are urgently sending a messenger to make repeated inquiries with Lord Tamba-no-kami and Lord Gaiki. So that you may be well informed of each matter's details, we are once again dispatching Takagi Zenemon.

[Marginal note in red]
The reason we say "dispatching again" is because Zenemon was recently sent to Sakuemon's place on separate business.

Though we trouble you repeatedly, please hear the details from him and handle the matter accordingly. Lord Kuroda Ise-no-kami also said that we should communicate these matters, so we do so accordingly. With utmost respect and humility.

When they first anchored at Nomozaki, it was about one ri (league) from the Kishiura area. Since it was difficult to station guard ships at that location, they rowed to Kishiura and moored about ten chō from the shore, where guard ships were stationed.

1. This corresponds to a location about twenty ri south of Jishima, equivalent to Karatsu. The distance from Jishima to Kishiura is approximately twenty ri. Kishiura lies to the southwest of Jishima. Karatsu lies further to the southwest of Kishiura.

1. The place where they drifted ashore is within Karatsu territory.
Kishiura, where this Chinese ship drifted ashore, is close to Nakatsu domain. Himeshima is an island off the coast of Kishi and is close to Karatsu domain.

1. Guard ships shall be carefully stationed, and the ship shall not be allowed to depart without instructions from the Magistrate.
However, it is most important that guard ships and other preparations for expulsion be maintained without negligence.
We have understood this directive. Guard ships and others have been carefully stationed. Preparations for expulsion have also been made ready.

The separate official document states as follows:
If they have no credentials and the Chinese request to be escorted away, but there are no instructions from the Magistrate's office, since they lack credentials, they should be expelled according to previous official documents. However, if they possess credentials, careful attention should be paid and [the matter should be reported] to the Magistrate's office.

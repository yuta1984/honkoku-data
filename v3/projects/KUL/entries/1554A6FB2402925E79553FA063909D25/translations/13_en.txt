The castaways were divided among the ships: two ships with four people each, one ship with three people, and another ship with two people. These two ships
came to Hawaii. The two ships that carried four people each went to a place called Petropavlovsk within Russian territory, where they landed the eight people and left them in the care of Russian officials. According to what those officials said, they would "put them on a ship bound for Japan and send them back," so the story goes. When Manjiro spoke of returning to Japan,
the five men said "We would very much like to return together." Just then a ship bound for China
entered port, so they sought passage and sent for Denzo and Gozaemon, but they came late,
and in the meantime that ship departed. The two men arrived afterward but were too late, and all felt mutually disappointed.
Now Gozaemon went back to his countryside residence again, and Denzo said "Now that the time for returning home has come, there's no point in working anymore" and stayed with Manjiro. While the Kishu people remained there as before,
another American whaling ship came loaded with oil, and hearing that this oil would be transferred to a merchant ship of the same country and sail directly to

The five from Kishu were earnestly requested to be taken aboard, and all four from Tosa refused and remained behind. Then Manjiro
went to a shipping agent and asked to be notified if any ships bound for China entered port, requesting this of the person who handled such affairs. About ten days later, he heard that an American ship was hiring sailors to go load medicinal herbs at a place called Shanghai in China,
and Manjiro met with that captain, requested passage, took the other three with him, sent for Goza-
emon, and told Toraemon about this, but Toraemon said "No matter what country one lives in

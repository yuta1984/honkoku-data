fastened with combs. The clothing varies in different colors. The climate feels like Japanese March or April year-round, with no variation between hot and cold. This place was visited over thirty years ago by an American person called Dr. Judd, who came to treat the illnesses of the people, taught them writing, provided various guidance, influenced the people, and gained their great devotion. Through his efforts, he received half the kingdom from the king and lives there to this day. This place is a trading post with branches of America, England, France, Holland, etc., where officials from various countries are stationed. Their residences are built in the style of their respective countries. To prepare food, they dig a hole and build a fire, place stones, and when the stones are well heated and the fire has burned out and the stones have fallen down, they place sweet potatoes on top, cover with wet mats, pile soil on top and pour water over it. The resulting steam cooks the potatoes. When taken out and peeled, they become like seaweed, which they put into gourds that hold about three to [measures] and let ferment for about two days. They also put raw fish into bowl-sized gourds (these are split in two and used as substitutes for dishes) and serve them. The family gathers and first the head of household uses his right index and middle fingers to pick up and eat the food piece by piece.

Various items including paper-wrapped pipes, tobacco pouches, Buddhist monks' robes, medicine pills, etc. were taken out and shown to everyone. When they gestured that these were all items from their country, [Dr. Judd] seemed to understand that they were undoubtedly Japanese.

Manjirō's Account
In the eleventh month of Tenpō 12, kinoto-ushi year, they departed Honolulu, with Manjirō alone taken by the captain to America. From this place they sailed out in the northeast direction, traveled about thirty ri and anchored at a barren island called Kingsmill. From there they sailed out in the northwest direction and spent the New Year at sea. This barren island has low mountains that are difficult to see when approaching closely. When viewed from a distance, uniform trees that look like erected masts can be seen - they are coconut palms. The inhabitants use these nuts as food. The people are dark-skinned with tattoos on their bodies

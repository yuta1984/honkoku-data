[The Russian] gestured for us to board, and those people also all boarded together, making gestures as if to take us to where the Russian people lived. They set sail on that small boat, and around four o'clock that same night, we arrived at a place within the same island where there was an outpost of the Russian nation. At this place, Russian ships of about three to four hundred koku capacity were also present, with more than thirty crew members aboard and more than thirty people on land as well. They rotate every three years, and the captain of that ship understood a little Japanese. We stayed at that same place for about a year under their care. We went out daily to collect driftwood for fuel, but in winter the cold was much more severe than in Japan, and our hands and feet became so numb that we could not work, so we only did indoor tasks.

since there were no grains, we ate only fish such as salmon, cod, and trout every day. During our stay, [they said] it would not be good for us to eat only fish, so this time, in the second year of rotation, they would take us elsewhere. The captain told us to board the ship and gave leather clothing, one garment each to the fifteen people. We gratefully received them and boarded that ship. On what I believe was April 3rd of the following year of the Rabbit, we departed from that place, and on the 27th of the same month, we arrived at an island called "Sanbameu." At that place too, there were more than forty Russian people, and they loaded stored fox pelts and "asarashi" (seals), stayed for about two days, then departed and arrived at an island called "Amiseituka." We stayed there for about two days as well, and then arrived at a harbor of a place called "Ohou," where there were five or six ships of approximately five hundred koku capacity.

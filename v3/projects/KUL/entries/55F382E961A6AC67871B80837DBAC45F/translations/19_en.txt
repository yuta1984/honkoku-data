All the people of the islands in this area are called "Ariou."
"Sanbameu" is also an island under Russian control, with the same climate as "Randeretsuke," with no particular differences in various matters. From that place to this location is about a thousand ri by sea route. This place also has a Russian outpost with about forty Russians stationed there. However, since we only moored our ship for about two days at this island, I do not know the details.

"Amiseitsuka" is also an island under Russian control, with the same climate as "Onderetsuke" and "Sanbameu," located about twelve hundred ri from Sanbameu. It is merely a small island but has many "sea otters."

This place also has a Russian outpost with Russians living there, though I don't recall their number. Russians told us that in previous years, a Japanese man named Kōtayū had been cast ashore in this area. Since we only moored our ship for about two days at this place as well, I do not know the details. Also, from the sea route from this island to "Ohōtsuka," one can see the cape of "Kamushatsuka" in the distance.

"Ohōtsuka" is a small harbor with no large ships. If they were Japanese vessels, there would be about five or six ships of roughly 400-500 koku capacity moored there. There are about two hundred houses, with a government office where officials from Russia are stationed. Many Russians live there, and the houses are built with round logs, with walls made of rough planks.

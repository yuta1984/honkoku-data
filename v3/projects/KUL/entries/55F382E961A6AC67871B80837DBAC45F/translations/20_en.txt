The houses are enclosed, with roofs thatched with boards and floor joists laid with rough planks. People from "Kamushatsuka" also come and go, and these are called "Kamushata." They wear deerskin clothing over their heads, and from this area, they are given "bread" as food. There are some cattle and horses, and although there are grasses and trees, the five grains do not grow.

"Yakōtsuka" - This place has about two thousand houses, and Russian officials also reside there. In this area, there are some fields where they mainly grow wheat. They raise cattle, horses, pigs, wild cattle, sheep, chickens, and such. Tigers rarely appear in this area, but there are many bears. Already, among the castaways, at the place where Sahei stayed overnight, two horses were taken by bears during the night.

The people of this place are called "Yakōta." From "Ohōtsuka" to this place is about a thousand ri, and there are no human dwellings at all along the way. No one travels on foot; everyone goes back and forth on horseback. Of course, there are no post stations, so from "Ohōtsuka" to "Yakōtsuka," they travel continuously. Therefore, they prepare two or three horses per person, and when evening comes, they camp in the open, eating bread and drinking water to stave off hunger, while the horses eat grass from the surrounding area. They departed "Ohōtsuka" in mid-August and finally arrived at "Yakōtsuka" on October 13th. During this time, it snowed almost daily, so the dried grass in the fields was buried in snow, fodder became scarce, and more than half the horses died.

When they came to Matsumae in previous years, we thoroughly
communicated that all trade would be difficult, and we do not permit them to use country names that resemble our nation's kana script.
First of all, Matsumae is not a place to report foreign affairs to the government. Even if they bring
the castaways remaining in that country, or if there are other petitions, Matsumae
will absolutely not handle such matters. For this reason, since Nagasaki is a place that deals with foreign
affairs and may have discussions about such matters, we gave them a letter of passage to reach Nagasaki.
Yet now, bringing the king's letter shows that they find it difficult to understand what was
communicated at Matsumae. This is entirely because we differ in territory and climate,
making communication difficult. This time, it appears to be a matter requiring us to receive and communicate the government's intentions anew.
We particularly provide provisions of firewood and water for their ship. Under these circumstances, they must absolutely not anchor their ships at islands near our country

or anywhere else. They should quickly leave this region and
promptly sail back home.

Regarding the Russian ship that arrived at Nagasaki, personnel were dispatched to that place, and all matters
were handled properly, with retainers also serving diligently.
This is thought to be due to the good management that has been consistently implemented.
This matter should be communicated as
the lord's will.

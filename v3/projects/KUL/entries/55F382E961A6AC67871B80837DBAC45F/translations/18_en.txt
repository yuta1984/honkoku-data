They gather and store driftwood that flows down from the interior. Their dwellings are dug into the ground like underground chambers, with round roofs plastered with earth, and grass spread inside. In this area, there are many "sea otters and seals," salmon, cod, trout, etc., and they make their living solely from fishing. All the fish caught are used as food, and the skins of "sea otters and seals" are traded with Russians for cloth, bladed tools, and such. There is indeed a Russian outpost, where about thirty Russians are stationed, rotating every three years. The ships used for these round trips appear to be equivalent to Japanese vessels of 300-400 koku capacity, with two masts. The barges and boats used for local travel have their exteriors covered with sea animal hides, and even the small single-person boats

This sea animal is called "Sē-ushi," shaped like a horse, with a face slightly shorter than a horse's, and tusks hanging from both cheeks that are three to four feet long, appearing gentle in nature. The climate has mild heat but severe cold. Even in summer, the castaways wear about two padded garments each, and when winter comes, snow accumulates heavily and the cold is so severe that hands and feet become numb, making outdoor work impossible, so everyone stays confined to their dwellings. Around the third month of spring, when the snow finally melts, they begin fishing activities.

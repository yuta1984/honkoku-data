Foreigners are not buried in their burial grounds; there are separate burial grounds exclusively for foreigners. The temple priests have full heads of hair, do not shave their beards, and wear robes with wide sleeves. There are also disciple-like followers, and during funeral ceremonies both the priests and disciples come out to read something like sutras while conducting the burial.

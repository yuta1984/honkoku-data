planning to open trade relations. Already on this second occasion, we understand that their deep desires regarding
our country are also urgent. However, the matter of commerce that they desire and request
is not something to be discussed again here. Our country's non-communication with overseas
nations has already been long-established. It is not that we do not know how to manage neighborly relations

and disrupting customs. This would be harmful to nurturing our people and is deeply worthless. Without trade
and commerce, merely establishing trust and forming new friendships is natural,
but it is also forbidden by our country and difficult to accomplish. Therefore, we do not engage in communication.
This is the court's intention. Do not waste effort in coming again.

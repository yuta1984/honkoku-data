Regarding the town layout of the national capital, the roads are about five to six shaku wide each, and there is one temple in each district. The district names are called after the names of these temples. Moreover, within each district there are only parishioners of that particular temple, and parishioners of other temples do not intermingle. The total number of temples is said to be 144. At the outskirts of each district, there are gates without exception. Now, regarding the arrangement of houses, merchant houses display their goods arranged in designated areas. Specifically, the textile merchant district consists only of textile merchants, and within these textile merchants there are districts that deal in woolen cloth, or cotton and hemp cloth, or silk goods, or leather goods - all completely separated. There are miscellaneous goods districts, notions districts, hardware districts, wooden goods districts, fish districts, bird and animal districts, and various other artisan districts.

These are also separated respectively in the same manner as described above, limited to their particular type, with those of other trades or other professions not living together. However, various officials live intermixed throughout these districts. Their residences also follow the pattern of the royal residence, having no estate compounds - they are also houses built up with stone, with many large and small houses. The ashigaru (foot soldier) district exists separately, where for official purposes long houses are built and partitioned inside for residence, housing many people. This district is quite a spacious area where they practice with firearms on ordinary days. Besides these, there are also said to be places for practicing literary and martial arts, as well as pleasure quarters, but I did not see these. In total, the entire national capital appeared to be about three ri square.

were moored there. At this place too, there was an office where a magistrate from Russia was stationed, along with more than two hundred houses. It appeared they handed us over to that office, and for meals they gave us "bread." We fifteen were all housed in a building with tatami mat seating that appeared to be the residence of an official, with a frontage of more than six ken and a depth of about eight to nine ken. On August 18th of the same year, an official came and said they would take us elsewhere, so we departed. Two lower-ranking officials accompanied us, put us on horses, and we departed one after another, traveling to a place called "Yakoutska." Since there were no houses along the way, we camped outdoors every day even when it snowed, and because the grass for feeding the horses was buried in snow and more than half the horses died, the Russians went ahead and brought three replacement horses from "Yakoutska" to

The host provided us with "bread" and pork daily during our stay. During this time, Ichigoro became ill with some kind of swelling disease. They called a doctor from that place, but there were no decoctions available - only liquid medicine to drink, or they would give him something like red grass seeds to eat. He was then taken to a sick house that existed at that location, so we also went to see him. There we found twenty to thirty patients lying bedridden. On December 24th of the same year, an official came again and gestured that we should depart from this place. That person accompanied us as we left that location. We arrived at a place like an inn in a village whose name I don't know, where a messenger-like person brought news that Ichigoro's treatment had been unsuccessful and he had died on October 23rd.

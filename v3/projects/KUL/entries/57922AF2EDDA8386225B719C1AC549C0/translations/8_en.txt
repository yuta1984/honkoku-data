They selected an auspicious day and divined the direction, and the fourteen men joined forces to
depart from the uninhabited island on June 8th of that year, setting out with the northwest as their destination.
As they were people who had received such miraculous divine protection,
their voyage was safe, and after sailing day and night for seven or eight days, they reached an
island. This island was located thirty-five ri south of Hachijō Island and
was called Aoga-shima. Until fourteen years prior, about four hundred people
from Hachijō Island had lived there, but when a volcanic eruption suddenly occurred, there was no way to escape,
so everyone returned to Hachijō Island. After the burning ended,
twelve people came to live there again to rescue shipwrecked sailors in the ocean.

Of these, three people had returned to Hachijō Island three years earlier to obtain grain, but
the tidal currents were extremely rough in that area, making sea travel difficult, and they had not
returned to this day. At present, only nine people lived in
about eight or nine small houses. Though the island's circumference was about four ri, no grain
grew at all. Moreover, there were many rats that devoured the seeds, so they could only
cultivate small amounts of taro to sustain themselves. After staying at this place for about thirty days,
the weather became particularly favorable, so they departed Aoga-shima on July 9th.
Though the entire route consisted of dangerous waters, without any delays they crossed the thirty-five ri of
ocean, setting out at the fifth hour of morning and reaching Hachijō by before the seventh hour.

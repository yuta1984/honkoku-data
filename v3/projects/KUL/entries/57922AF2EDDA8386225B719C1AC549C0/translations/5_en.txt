They dug out three cave dwellings and used reeds as floor coverings for their living quarters.
Since they had no proper tools to begin with, and especially because of the difficult terrain, even digging one location
required the labor of forty to fifty people. Fundamentally, this uninhabited island was a small island with a circumference
of about two ri, covered entirely with flourishing reeds, or with towering rocks,
with no bamboo, trees, or grasses for climbing. In the occasional flat areas,
birds like what are called "Okinotai" in Mihonoseki gathered in flocks, showing no
fear of humans whatsoever. Every year they would arrive in groups to lay eggs, and until around
May of the following year they would raise their chicks before departing to parts unknown. These white birds
had only black flight feathers, and when they spread their wings they were large birds of about seven to eight shaku, unable to

take flight easily in windless conditions. They would beat these to death with sticks for their daily food,
and also prepared them as provisions for about one hundred days of summer. Furthermore, in the valleys there were

trees resembling paper mulberry and hemp, and when they stripped off the bark and washed it in water, it became like coarse ramie fiber.
Using this as thread with bird meat as bait, they fished and caught
fish closely resembling what are called "Kuroya" in Mihonoseki, small fish of about nine sun to one shaku
in length. Or they would gather seaweed and such from behind rocks as food.
It was an extremely warm place with severe heat, and even during the cold season
it never became colder than the chill of September in Japan. Throughout the island there were crows, white-eyes,
and bush warblers in exceptionally large numbers. The man from Tosa Province had been eating only raw birds and raw fish, but

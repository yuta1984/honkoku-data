There was a roof thatched with reeds, and below too reeds were spread out as flooring, along with torn padded clothes, old
straw sandals, and dried fish, so thinking there might be inhabitants, they continued
searching, but as the day was drawing to evening, and especially in such treacherous terrain,
there seemed to be no easy way to proceed, so they first returned to their original location. The next morning
again three men together gradually searched, and found that roughly on the eastern side of the island there was a rocky mountain requiring a climb of about thirty

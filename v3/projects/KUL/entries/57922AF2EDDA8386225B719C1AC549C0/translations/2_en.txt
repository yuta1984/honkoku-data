Seizo had been working as a sailor since he was seventeen years old, sailing to various places and
returning to his home country many times. Eleven years ago, when he was twenty-three years old,
he sailed on a ship belonging to Binzenya Gisaburo of Osaka (850 koku capacity, crew of eleven) from
Niigata in Echigo, carrying government rice to Edo, and then was supposed to load
rice from Sendai. On the 8th day of the 11th month of the Year of the Sheep, they departed from Urakawa in Sagami Province
heading for Oshu, but from the 9th day onward, they drifted from the waters off Kujukuri Beach in Boso Province
toward the southeast for about 130 days and nights. Naturally, no land was
visible at all, and although it was midwinter, perhaps because they approached near sunrise, the heat was extraordinarily
intense, truly exceeding extreme summer heat aboard the ship, making it unbearable even for a moment.

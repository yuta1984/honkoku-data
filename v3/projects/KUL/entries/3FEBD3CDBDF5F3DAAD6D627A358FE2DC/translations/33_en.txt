When I searched for a place to hide, I found one spot at the foot of the mountain. Finally, I set up a semicircular fence here and built a hut inside it.
From the 26th day to the 30th day, I transported various implements that I had brought from the ship to the hut. During this time it rained heavily from time to time.
On the 31st day, I rose early, took my large gun, entered the mountains, and caught one male goat and its kid.
On the 1st day of the 11th month, I took the various materials from which I had made the raft and used them to enclose the hut, substituting for the four walls.
On the 3rd day, I again went out with my gun and caught two birds. Their shape resembled cranes. At noon I cooked them and feasted myself. Their taste was extremely delicious.
On the 4th day, I established a routine, allocated time periods, and organized daily tasks. On clear days

I hunt with my gun every morning for an hour and a half. Also, from about 9 AM to about 1 PM I rest in the hut. This is because the extreme heat is unbearable. On this day and the next, I made a desk and table.
On the 5th day, I took the dog out hunting. I caught one wildcat. The meat is inedible. Its hide is soft. Generally, I store all the hides of beasts I catch and await future uses for them. Also, when I walk along the beach there are various seabirds. I also encountered water buffalo, but caught none of them.
On the 6th day, I finished making the desk this morning.
On the 7th day, clear weather. On this day I made a chair.
On the 13th day, thunderstorm. At this time, fearing that the gunpowder would be ignited by lightning, I divided it and secretly stored it in various places.

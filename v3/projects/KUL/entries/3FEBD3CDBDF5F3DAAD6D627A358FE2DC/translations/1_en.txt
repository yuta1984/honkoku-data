Preface by the Dutch Translator
Robinson Crusoe of England had ambitions to travel the four corners of the world. While sailing the great ocean, he encountered a hurricane and barely escaped with his life in a small boat. During his sea journey, he was again captured by pirates and sold to fishermen. At that time, while attempting to flee to another country by fishing boat and worrying about his pursuers, he was unexpectedly rescued by a Portuguese merchant ship. He then cultivated sugar cane and became very wealthy. Still not deterred by maritime disasters, he built a large ship and set sail again, but once more encountered storms and great waves that wrecked his vessel. He barely managed to drift ashore on a deserted island with nothing but his life. On this island, he devised various means of survival and spent twenty-eight years there before fortuitously finding a ship from his homeland and returning home. This work, which records the events of that period, has been translated into Dutch to make known these deeds to the people. Indeed, all who read of these deeds cannot help but be filled with wonder and admiration.

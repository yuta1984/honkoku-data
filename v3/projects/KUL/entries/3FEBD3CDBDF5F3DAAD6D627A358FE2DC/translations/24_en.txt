Since there were no mast rigging, I was greatly troubled. At that time, there were three heavenly blessings that allowed me to reach the shore. First, the sea surface was flat without waves; second, the tidal water was rising and advancing toward the shore; third, there was a gentle breeze that slowly blew me forward. When I had drawn somewhat near to the shore, large waves arose and I was about to crash into the rocks. Therefore, I supported myself with a short pole and barely managed to reach the mouth of a small stream where I moored the raft.

I fired my gun and captured it. Startled by the explosion, all the birds in the forest flew up with great cries and departed. ◯The bird I had captured was a bird of prey, and its meat was inedible. I returned to where the raft was to establish a sleeping place. However, to lie down on the ground

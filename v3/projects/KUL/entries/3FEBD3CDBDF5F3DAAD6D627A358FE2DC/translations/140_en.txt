Mountains echoed and valleys responded, causing the wolves to recoil slightly. Taking advantage of this opening, twelve guns simultaneously pulled their triggers. Thunder shook and shattered heaven and earth, and the flash of gunpowder shot through the wolves' eyes. At this, the remaining wolves immediately scattered in all directions, entering the forest completely. I again commanded our party to quickly load bullets and advance. At that time, the sky had already grown dark. From within the forest, we began to hear tumultuous sounds. At first they were somewhat distant, but as we advanced they gradually drew nearer.

However, those wolves will surely gather and devour greedily at the place where they pursue and catch the horse. We should take advantage of that interval to pass through," and so we finally proceeded forward. I also thought there must be about three hundred wolves. ◯Not far from leaving the forest entrance

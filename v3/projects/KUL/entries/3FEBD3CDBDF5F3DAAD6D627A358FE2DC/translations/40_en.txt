On the 17th day, wreckage from the ship that had been floating two ri offshore drifted near, so I collected it.

From the 18th to the 24th day, I cut away all the ship's planks with an axe. Around this time, the wind blew toward the shore. Due to this, small boxes and barrels that had remained over there floated and naturally drifted here. The barrel containing dried meat had been penetrated by seawater and rotted, making it inedible. I gathered and piled up all the planks, iron, and similar materials. This was because I planned to build a small boat later. I also collected lead totaling over 100 kin.

On the 16th day of the 6th month, I wandered along the beach and caught one large turtle. I did not know that such creatures existed on this island. Therefore, I search for them daily. I obtained one hundred in a day. However, I fear that after a long time, I will catch them all.

On the 17th day, I cut it (the turtle) open and obtained sixty eggs. Indeed, there was no harm in feeding them to the goats and doves. Finally, when I ate the meat, how delicious it was! With this, I greatly supplemented my food supply.

On the 18th day, it rained all day, and the cold was like snow and frost. I was greatly puzzled that such cold weather existed in this warm climate zone. The next day was even more severe.

On the 20th day, I contracted a fever, and my headache was as if my head would split. Therefore, I could not sleep all night.

On the 21st day, the fever became even more intense, and my distress was particularly severe. Although I had previously suffered from rough seas, since leaving "Hünbel" (place name), I had never experienced such headaches. I cannot bear the confusion in my brain.

On the 22nd day, although I recovered somewhat, it eventually became a chronic illness, and I fear dying.

I buried them in ashes, piled firewood around them, and set fire to everything at once. With a great fire burning and roasting, the entire bodies of the jars turned red. After firing for about three hours, still keeping the fire intense, the sand content within the clay began to melt in the fierce flames. I gradually reduced it to a gentle fire, using the jars turning pale white as my guide. However, I kept the fire burning all night without letting it die out. The next day I extinguished the fire and let them cool, and they were as hard as stone. I placed these three jars beside the dining plates, and they were especially convenient for holding water and liquids. ○However, since those jars were made without glaze, they were porous and not beautiful. I molded three more and coated them with sand as a substitute for glaze. When fired, the sand melted and became just like glaze. These jars were hard and beautiful. I also fired earthen pots for use, which were particularly excellent for cooking goat meat and such. ○At one time, in order to grind grain into flour,

I sought something to serve as a millstone but could not find one. After much troubled thought, I realized that although I lacked the tools that stonemasons use, if I used an iron bar as a substitute for a stone-breaking hammer, the work of a stonemason would be no different from this. I sought suitable stones for several days, searching the entire island, but found nothing appropriate. There were many in the mountain crags, but they could not be cut out. When I searched along the seashore, all those stones were porous and difficult to use for grinding. Finally I gave up on using stone. ○I entered the forest intending to make a wooden mortar, searching extensively for tree stumps, but found none. Therefore I used an axe to bore horizontally from the outside to create a hollow, chiseled the bottom of that hollow, and furthermore used fire to burn the interior to make it easier to bore through. ○Finally I completed one mortar. The exhaustion was beyond what words can describe. However, I used fire following the example of the people of Brazil in making their dugout canoes.

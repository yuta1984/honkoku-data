Half would remain on the island, and the rest would be taken aboard the ship to work. The captain arranged all affairs and prepared for the return journey. I told the captain, "You board the ship first. I will stay one night in the fortress to finish important business." ◯ Then I summoned the five surrendered soldiers who were to remain on the island and appointed the most intelligent among them as temporary island governor.

If you go to your homeland, you will be punished. You should remain on this island permanently.

On this day we still cast anchor and repaired the sails and masts. I stayed on the ship with the captain and spent another night. The next morning we were about to set sail.

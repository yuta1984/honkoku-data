Going deeper, there is a dense forest where I see various fruits growing abundantly. Also, melons grow with vines spreading on the ground. There are also ripe grapes. I am greatly surprised to see these. However, this is still not enough to dispel my worries. Those fruits are not suitable as food. I have heard that European "slaves" sold in "Barbary" countries sometimes develop fever or die from diarrhea after overeating these plants. I also know from Europe that there is a way to eat these things without being poisoned. If you hang them in the air, dry them in the sun, and then eat them, they cause no harm.

The scenery of this field is so beautiful that I do not wish to return even when night falls. Like when I first drifted to this island, I lie down on a tree, and tomorrow I will explore its depths again. Following the valley for about four ri, turning straight north, I rest under a hill, and from there finally emerge into open fields.

This field extends long to the west, with a small stream inside. The water is clear and fresh, its source being from this hill. It flows along the hill and empties toward the east. For the first time, I was able to grasp the topography of this island. This is truly a land where people should live. Green grass and fruits also grow in various places. Their appearance is like cultivated fields made by humans. And flowers never cease, flourishing through all four seasons like spring days.

Going around the valley and exploring further, there are very many types of citrus fruits and Buddha's hand citrons. If you eat Buddha's hand citrons when their skin is green, they taste good and do not harm the stomach. I always add water to their juice and drink it. It is refreshing and particularly fine. Though I freely take whatever grows on the entire island, there is no one to forbid it. I could truly be called the king of this island.

I gather things suitable for food and return, preparing for the rainy season. Therefore, I collected Buddha's hand citrons and grapes.

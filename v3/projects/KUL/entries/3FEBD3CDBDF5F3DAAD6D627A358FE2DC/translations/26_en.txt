I thought there was none, but there were still 400 kan of steamed bread, 400 kan of wheat flour, and three large barrels of spirits. Taking these gave me great strength. The next day I arrived again and carried what could be lifted with large containers, and also split the ship's timber with an axe to make a large raft to transport iron implements, but midway I accidentally dropped them into the sea. So I swam and used rope to pull up everything without exception. ◯After that, for another thirteen days, I made trips to and from the wrecked ship eleven times. I thought to myself that I had transported all the various tools from the ship through wisdom and strength. When I was about to make one final trip, although a light wind arose, the tide had receded so I received no harm from it, and finally reached the ship. When I searched everything thoroughly, there was another box. Inside it were one razor, scissors, several small knives, thirty-six gold and silver coins, and one or two pieces of stamped gold.

Finally I threw the coins into the sea, wrapped the other items in canvas and was about to return when the wind suddenly arose. Therefore I remained at the wrecked ship for several hours. That wind had the quality of severe winter. After a while the tide rose and I was able to reach the shore. Later large waves arose, but I had already returned to my hut. The sleeping area contained many household items and precious vessels. That night there was again a great wind that continued until dawn. The next morning when I looked at the sea, the wrecked ship had been smashed and not even a single wooden plank could be seen. However, I had generally finished transporting the important mechanical items. The things I had left behind, I was later able to pick up when various items washed ashore during times when the waves were calm. ◯At this time, thinking carefully, if there were violent people or fierce beasts on this island, this small hut would not be reliable. Therefore I would need to find land to construct a new dwelling.

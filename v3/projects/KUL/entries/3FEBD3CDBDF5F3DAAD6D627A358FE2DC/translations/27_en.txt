searching. The record of constructing this dwelling will surely make readers frown. The small hut I built earlier was on wet, muddy ground. Living there long would certainly cause dropsy. Also, it was far from a water source. So I wandered about searching for a place near well water, without wet mud, with little fear of rain, dew, or scorching sun, where I could constantly watch the sea, and where violent people or fierce beasts would not come. My desire to constantly watch the sea was to spot land or large ships and call out to them, or swim to them to escape from this island. ◯Here I found a high hill standing like a wall, somewhat hollowed out like a shallow cave, with a large rock above so there was no worry of earth falling on one's head. Though the hollow resembled a shallow cave, inside it was extremely narrow and could not accommodate a person lying down. However, being on the northwest of the high hill, it could avoid the sun's strong rays.

Also, the area in front of the rock was 250 jō wide and 500 jō long. I built a semicircular fence 50 jō long in front of the hollow. For this fence I erected two large tree trunks that were firmly planted and could not be pulled out. From these I arranged stakes five shaku long, driving half into the ground with half above ground. To each stake I tied stakes of two shaku five sun, continuing to make it higher. The gaps between stakes were about two or three sun, and I stretched and tied ropes between each stake, making it so solid that neither man nor beast could penetrate it. There was no gate in front - I used a small ladder leaning against it for entry and exit. However, cutting this stake material from the forest and driving it into the ground required great labor. ◯After fortifying this enclosure in this way, I slept peacefully every night. Later I learned that such a solid fortification was useless. ◯Later I built another huge dwelling, covering the roof with canvas to protect against rain and dew, and inside it built another small hut.

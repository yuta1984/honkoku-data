On June 3rd, we saw what appeared to be people in the distance, so we gradually brought our small boat closer to shore to get a better look. They were indeed people, but their appearance was strange - their hair was cut short with shaved crowns, and their clothing appeared to be animal skins with feathers, as if bird feathers were growing from their entire bodies. They hardly looked human. Could this be the Island of Demons? Everyone on the boat was filled with dread and terror. Even if we wanted to flee this place, we didn't know where to go or which country to head for. If we went ashore, we would become food for demons. Thinking of our parents, wives, children, and siblings back in our homeland, we all wept quietly together in sorrow.

After a while, the island people - about fourteen or fifteen men and women - gathered and beckoned to us with their hands. This made us even more frightened, so we drew lots to divine whether it would be good or bad to go ashore. The oracle said "no hardship," so we decided to land regardless. When we brought our boat to the rocky shore, they gathered around and pulled our small boat up onto the beach, speaking various words that we could not understand.

Then women brought us water and some brought grilled fish, showing us kindness and care in various ways. The men gathered firewood and built fires on the beach. Truly, though their appearance and hearts were very different from ours, their sincerity surpassed even that of Japanese people, to such a degree that we felt ashamed. Finally, we felt as though we were alive again. That night we spent on the beach.

The next day, the 4th, we went to see where these people lived. They dwelled in earth pits, with wooden posts set around the holes and roofs thatched with earth and grass. Looking inside the pits, we saw many bones of birds and beasts, which startled us again. However, their food consisted entirely of fish, birds, and beasts - they used no grains at all.

While staying in this place, on June 8th, our ship's captain Heibei died of illness. There were no doctors and no medicine available, so he died in vain. It was truly pitiful, and we all wept, mourning deeply. We buried him in this land.

After staying about three days, a man of about fifty years came and spoke various words, but we couldn't understand anything. Observing this man's manner, he boarded the small boat we had arrived in

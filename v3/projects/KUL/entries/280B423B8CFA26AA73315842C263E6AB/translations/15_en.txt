The deity or Buddha painted on that board was hung in high places even in ordinary homes, where people prayed to it morning and evening. There were no other objects resembling gods or Buddhas. Therefore, what they call "Gosuhojin" might refer to these things, and while I could understand the words "Nihon Mikouyai" when spoken, I could not comprehend their meaning.

Their calendar was a perpetual calendar that remained unchanged no matter how many years passed. A year had twelve months, with some months having twenty-nine days, others thirty, and still others thirty-one days. There were no leap months, and the seasons were very different from Japan's. There was no sense of spring and autumn seasons - it was an extremely cold country. Since I could not read and understand the characters on their calendar, I cannot describe it in detail. When we drifted from Japan and tried to keep track of the days and months, we had no sense of having spent a long time drifting at sea, so we forgot what day of the month it was. Therefore, we would see the crescent moon at the beginning of the month and decide it was the third day, or see the full moon on the fifteenth night and decide it was the fifteenth day. As the years passed and we didn't know about leap months, while in Russia we wanted to keep our calendar in line with Japan's, so we made some months long months and others short months. Even so, thinking there might be discrepancies, we would adjust by observing the crescent and full moons, and after three years we would add a leap month, making thirteen months in a year, gradually counting the days. When we arrived in Nagasaki on what we thought was the sixth day of the ninth month and asked if it was indeed the sixth, we were told it was the fifth. We were disappointed to be off by one day.

In a woman's sewing box, there was an animal's tail about as thick as a cat's tail, resembling a rat's tail but covered with fur, about five inches long. When I held it to my nose and smelled it, it had a very pleasant fragrance, so I asked the woman what it was. She said it was a musk tail, explaining that if you put this tail in a box with clothing, it works wonderfully to repel insects, and she offered to give it to me.

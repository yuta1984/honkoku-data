1. On the 27th day of the 11th month of Kansei 5 (1793), they departed from Ishinomaki Kawaguchi and arrived at Higashi-ishiura. On the 29th, due to a southwest wind, they departed from the same place and were sailing northward when on the last day of the month, the sky suddenly changed and strong westerly winds began to blow, so they dropped anchor at a place called Hirono in Iwaki domain.

On the 1st day of the 12th month, strong southeast winds blew and high waves arose, making it impossible to remain there. They raised anchor and attempted to return home, but that night at the hour of the Boar (around 10 PM), the wind shifted to the north, creating favorable conditions. They righted the ship and sailed north again, but the wind turned southeast again with strong winds and large waves that caused the ship to list severely.

Two or three large waves crashed over each other, and while they were struggling to cope, the rudder broke, causing the ship to list again with waves constantly crashing over the deck. Having no choice, they cut down the mast and threw overboard stones, rice, and other cargo to lighten the ship. However, the situation remained dire with massive waves threatening their lives. The crew cut their hair and made vows to various gods and buddhas, working desperately for their lives, but the situation was difficult to overcome. Reluctantly, they even threw overboard 800 bales of rice (御穀), after which the ship's condition improved somewhat.

On the 2nd of the same month, strong westerly winds blew; on the 3rd, large waves crashed into the ship multiple times; and on the 4th and 5th, the same winds continued to blow them off course. They drifted into open ocean where no mountains were visible in any direction. They prayed to the Grand Shrine of Ise and drew a sacred lot, which indicated they were "170 ri offshore." The crew lost heart, realizing they had no other recourse but to protect the ship and pray to various gods and buddhas that they might drift back to Japanese waters in the coming 4th or 5th months. 

Recognizing that protecting the ship was crucial, they cleaned up the interior and constructed barriers to prevent waves from crashing in while they drifted. From the 8th day onward, the wind and waves were strong, with no calm days until the 25th. On the 26th, a great wind arose that seemed ready to break the ship apart, and the violent wind and waves carried them even further offshore. They deployed two "tarase" (sea anchors made of cypress rope with rice attached to slow the ship's drift). When they prayed to the Grand Shrine again and drew lots, it indicated "270 ri offshore."

From then, on the 11th day of the 1st month of the Year of the Tiger, great winds and waves arose, breaking the ship's stern section (mogi) and washing away the water buckets (hatsu).

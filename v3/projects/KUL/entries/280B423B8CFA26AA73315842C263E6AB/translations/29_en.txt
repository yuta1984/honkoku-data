We arrived at this place on September 3rd of the same year. This country has no horses, but uses deer like horses. They are larger in form than Japanese deer. They have two antlers, but the antlers have many small branches attached, and branches are attached to those branches as well. People ride them and use them to transport goods. Their coat colors include red, black, and white.
We departed from this place on April 9th. The distance across the sea was over 1,900 ri, heading toward South America.
In the middle of this sea, according to the story of the Russian ship captain, this place is the center of the world's three countries, so on that day we celebrated aboard ship with sake and food.

South America is a general name. It is within Tenjiku (India).
We arrived at a place called Ekaterena within America. This place is a port for ships to dock. The people of this place are jet black. Men wear something like loose trousers, and from the waist up they are naked. However, some occasionally wear something like a haori jacket or happi coat.
Women arrange pleats only around their waist like a loincloth, with the hem spreading out. In this country, when meeting people, the custom is to tap the shoulder and remove [clothing] as a greeting. Their heads are shaved (rahotsu). They are skilled at climbing upward.
This country is a warm nation with only summer and no winter, so rice, soybeans, red beans, and various grains ripen abundantly. They pound grain day and night with water mills. Also, the fruits of various trees ripen two to three times per year.
Hot peppers are planted three times, but they don't bear fruit each time they're planted; rather, if planted once, they bloom and bear fruit three times, like Japanese tea plants. Also, although this country has abundant rice for some reason, they constantly eat corn ground into flour and kneaded.
House construction includes both stone buildings and timber buildings. Roofs are made of cherry bark. The language is also different. There are no rain shutters or shoji screens at all. They say this place is where Shakyamuni Buddha practiced in the western lands for the salvation of all beings, where he resided for many years. They also say this place is where the Buddha was born.

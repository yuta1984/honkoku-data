Around midnight, they arrived at Tsugi-no-ura, but since the Chinese ship could not be seen there either, they sailed up to Wakamatsu offshore.
To inspect the Chinese ship that had been driven to Shiroshima, the small boat captain sailed around offshore
and conducted surveillance. From the mainland, it could be faintly seen about twelve to thirteen ri in the northwest direction.
During this time, storms were constant and waves were high, with large waves crashing into all ships, making it impossible to
venture far offshore. Therefore, each vessel rowed back from Tsugi-no-ura offshore. They then entered Wakamatsu,
spent the night, and the following day, the 16th, returned to Ashiya via Sendai. As it was a rotation day,
replacements came from Fukuoka.

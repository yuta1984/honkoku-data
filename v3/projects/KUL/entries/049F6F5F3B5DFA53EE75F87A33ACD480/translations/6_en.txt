However, this was not the case, and when the order to cease fire was circulated by messenger boat, everyone stopped shooting according to the instructions. After that, the Chinese crawled out from the ship's hold, maneuvered the damaged sail, caught what little wind there was with the sail, and like escaping from a crocodile's mouth, after a while retreated to the open sea. The attacking party also rowed back to the original Jishima.

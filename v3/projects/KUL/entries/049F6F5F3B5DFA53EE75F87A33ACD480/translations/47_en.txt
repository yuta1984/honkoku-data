They rowed around in various directions trying to engage, but being nighttime they could not tell, and as all ships were also rowing around in various directions searching for the Chinese ship, dawn finally broke. The offshore waters cleared and they spotted the Chinese ship about three ri away and pressed forward to attack. At that moment, a morning storm blew and the Chinese ship adjusted its sails and sailed away. About two ri later, the Chinese ship fired one stone fire arrow and set sail. Since all our ships were rowing vessels, they could not catch up easily, so the sailors exerted themselves to pursue. At that point, another stone fire arrow was fired from our side, causing our crew members to become frightened and unable to work the oars properly. Since ships that don't push the oars cannot advance, they used bamboo poles to strike and encourage the sailors to row. Then the land breeze stopped and became a west wind, causing the Chinese ship to drift even more. At this point, the vessels of Wakamatsu Jihei and Maruo Yahyōe

caught up to the Chinese ship and fired cannons at it. Meanwhile, the boats of Shinomiya Sukedayū and Hirano Takusuke also caught up, and with four vessels they took turns reloading and firing. Although they were somewhat distant, they continued to attack. After that, the Chinese ship stopped firing stone fire arrows, and all the Chinese crew went into the ship's hold. For a while, our side continued the pursuit and attack, but when the west wind blew and the ships became widely separated, everyone ceased firing and withdrew. Nishikawa Sōzaemon's ship never caught up, so it did not fire any arrows. The total number of projectiles fired from our side was 180. The Chinese ship fired stone fire arrows, and we returned fire with our own arrows. Afterward, as the Chinese ship retreated, we withdrew and returned to Ashiya around the hour of the Sheep on the 11th day. Reports came from the islands that the Chinese ship subsequently drifted 24 or 25 ri offshore.

Upon arriving [at the lodging], [Fukuda Kasuke] breathed his last and died on the spot. It was truly a pitiful affair. On the following fourth day, Fukuda's remains were placed on a ship and sent to Fukuoka. Among the crew members, his assistant Fukui Denpei accompanied [the body].

1. After that, the aforementioned two Chinese ships were seen escaping toward the northwest (inu/northwest direction) offshore. Around the tenth day of the same month, they could be seen intermittently, appearing and disappearing behind the waves, but from around the thirteenth or fourteenth day onward, not even a trace of their sails could be seen. Reports came in from all the lookout posts that they could no longer be spotted at all. According to instructions from Fukuoka, if no sail shadows are sighted for a while longer, orders would be given to withdraw from the Jishima posting. These men were to continue their duties until the next rotation.

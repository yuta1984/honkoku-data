Having troubled your territory, the great official and small boats from various countries escorted our ship to Nagasaki.
For more than a month, day and night we labored with worry, but fortunately signs of departure have appeared.
The great official's abundant blessings, peaceful and safe passage all the way - our gratitude is immeasurable, this virtue unforgettable.

Five hundred ri, and during that distance there are high mountains and great rivers making the journey difficult, requiring many days for minor officials to make the round trip, so they cannot arrive quickly. Therefore, our officials have moved your ship to anchor here. This place is called Shiotsu, not far from the provincial capital, very convenient for all matters, with nothing that cannot be obtained if sought. If there is anything needed on the ship, please let us know. We will consult with the authorities and provide it. Moreover, this area is on the direct route to Nagasaki, so the ship's passengers need not worry.

Receiving the kind compassion of the great official, on our ship we have no firewood or rice, having been at sea for many days, the great ropes cannot be used, and our sails are torn by wind and unusable.　　Wang
For sails and ropes, report to the authorities for repair, and do not worry about the shortage of firewood and rice - officials will provide them.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Naru[sawa]

Having received various goods from all the great officials, I cannot repay this kindness with my present circumstances.　　Wang
Helping and rescuing those in distress is national policy. How much more so for you drifters! Do not be concerned about repayment.　　　　　　　　　　　　　Naru[sawa]
I am deeply grateful for your kindness.　　　　　　　　　　　　Wang
I have heard in detail about the questions and answers at Hikimoto-ura, so I will not ask again. Was your honorable ship caught by northwest winds and drifted directly to the Kumano region, or did you pass south and then turn north? How many days did it take?　　Naru[sawa]
On the sixth day of the twelfth month, while in the west, we saw one great mountain. There were eight or nine small mountains running north to south. We could only stay nearby and could not climb the great mountain. Then northwest winds arose and we went southeast for four days and five nights. When the wind calmed we again headed west, but the west wind was strong and we immediately went southeast. Twenty days and twenty-one nights.

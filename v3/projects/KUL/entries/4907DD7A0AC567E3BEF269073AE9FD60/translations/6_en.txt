1. Around midnight in mid-April, the aforementioned seven men were put ashore on the beach. Since there were footprints in the sand, we thought there must be dwellings somewhere, so Hatsutaro and I followed those footprints for about four cho (approximately 440 meters). We found two houses with roofs thatched with palm-like leaves and frontages of about four ken (approximately 7.2 meters). At the entrance, a person who looked like an animal keeper was sleeping alone. When we woke him up, he seemed surprised, so we gestured to show that we had been shipwrecked and asked for help. He seemed to understand and immediately gave us water to drink. (Marginal note: The vessel was like a pot with handles for drinking water.) When we gestured that five others remained on the beach, one person from that house accompanied us back to the original beach and brought the five men to the house.

That night, at the same place, they spread cattle hide under the trees (Marginal note: These trees were unfamiliar to us) and let us rest. The next morning, all the men and women from that house came out to look at us. Of the seven people, three of us—myself, Hatsutaro, and Yakichi—were placed under the eaves of that house with cattle hide spread out, while the other four—Inosuke, Takichi, Sosuke, and Mozaburo—were similarly placed under the eaves of the neighboring house. For food, twice daily in the morning and evening, we were given things like millet dumplings, and for side dishes, salt-boiled chicken and pork, as well as wild cattle milk mixed with sugar.

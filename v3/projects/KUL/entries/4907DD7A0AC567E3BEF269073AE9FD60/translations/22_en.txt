One monk accompanied us to the cemetery and chanted sutras for us. At that cemetery, we found two stone monuments inscribed with "Japanese person so-and-so," though I do not remember the names.

First, since we were scheduled to depart from this place soon, the person who had been caring for us during our stay hosted a farewell banquet. On the fifteenth day of the eleventh month, we went to a house across the way (the rear entrance appeared to be four ken wide and about six ken deep), and were led to a room like a parlor with wooden flooring of about twenty tatami mats in size. Each of us sat on curved stools with felt mats spread on them, and around a table with legs about two shaku five sun high for three or four people, there were arranged pork, horse mackerel, sardines, jellyfish, watermelon, plums in sugar-pickled vegetables, and various other dishes served on plates. Our hosts included three official-like persons, two interpreters, one guard-like person, and four ship captains bound for Nagasaki. We received exceptional hospitality from about the fourth hour of morning until evening and returned. The next morning, we all went to the office-like place we had first visited to take our leave and express our gratitude for the care we had received.

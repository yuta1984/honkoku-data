First, while staying at this place, the "Comandante" taught me horizontal writing (Western script). At first, I could not understand it at all, but gradually I came to understand daily words, and naturally learned a little about how to use the letters and some "American" words as well. The horizontal writing has three styles - regular, cursive, and semi-cursive script - each with twenty-seven letters.

Since these beasts are used for food, many are kept for future use. Besides these, there are monkeys, rabbits

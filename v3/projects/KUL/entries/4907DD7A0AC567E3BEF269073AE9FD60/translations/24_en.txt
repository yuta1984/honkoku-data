After a detailed examination of these areas was completed, we appeared before the magistrate in the upper part of the white sand court. There, we were thoroughly questioned about whether we had any involvement with religious sects (Christianity) in that country (China), and whether we had loaded firearms or sword-like weapons from Japan, among other matters. After this interrogation, we were ordered to be confined to the detention house (agaya), and after being told that we should be grateful for this arrangement, we were called to what appeared to be a kitchen area where, by order of the magistrates, we were served elaborate meals with rice and sake. From there, accompanied by officials, we went to the detention house. From the following fourth day, we appeared in the white sand court where we were repeatedly questioned about whether we had any involvement with the Christian faith, and about the circumstances of our drift, appearing in the white sand court daily for approximately fifty days.

After the above examination was completed, the deputy officials read [the findings] aloud, and furthermore, there was additional interrogation before the magistrates, who directly asked us if there were no discrepancies. They then read aloud a statement to the effect that "we had no involvement with the Christian faith in foreign countries, neither seeing, hearing, being encouraged, nor speaking of it. However, should anything come to light later, we would have no objection to whatever punishment might be imposed," and we affixed our seals to this.

First, when we went to the detention house on the third day of the twelfth month of the Year of the Rabbit, the nine drifters who returned this time, including myself, were all housed together on ten tatami mats within a space of about fifteen to sixteen tatami mats.

After I became the only one remaining, the magistrates treated me with particular care. The detention house was left unlocked both day and night, and officials would make occasional rounds, telling me to make requests if there was anything I needed. The yoriki (officials) also made monthly rounds to inquire about my condition, and I was told I could request hair shaving and visits to temples and shrines as often as I wished. I was treated with great consideration. Because of this, I frequently visited temples and shrines in Nagasaki through formal requests.

As described above, I arrived at the port of Nagasaki on the third day of the twelfth month of Tenpō 14, Year of the Rabbit, was immediately ordered into the detention house, and remained there until the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month of the following Year of the Dragon.

On the same day, I was handed over from this place (Nagasaki) to the officials in charge, went down to a travel inn, departed from there on the twenty-ninth, and arrived at Iwamoto on the twenty-third day of the first month of the current Kōka 2, Year of the Snake. This period totaled approximately four hundred and ten days.

　　　　　Second month of the Year of the Snake
　　　　　　Additional notes

First, around the twentieth day of the second month of the Year of the Tiger, when we were transferred to a foreign ship, someone like a ship's captain examined the palms of myself and the thirteen sailors. Since we were offshore captains who did not do rough work, unlike the sailors, our palms were soft, while the sailors who did rough work had hard palms—perhaps he was confirming this difference. The sailors were made to work aboard the ship.

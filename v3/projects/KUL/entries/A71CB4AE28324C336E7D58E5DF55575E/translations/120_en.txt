On the left side, they plant one large flag given by Britain. It is three shaku wide and over five shaku long, with red and white stripes. The building is divided into several structures.
The vacant ground within the gate serves as a military training ground. The rampart lines are irregular, protruding and receding, not square. The lower part is paved with stones, and the upper part, extending over two ken, is an earthwork.
The thickness of the rampart is also over two ken. The three sides facing the sea at the rear have strict fortifications, with one large cannon placed every few steps. Among these, the largest are four or five guns, over one jō in construction, with an inner bore diameter of over one shaku, made of bronze. Beside each cannon, iron cannonballs are necessarily piled up like a roof to accompany the cannon. Their number is immeasurable. Moreover, they do not rust even when moistened by rain and dew. The front of the castle connects to the town streets and has no gun positions. The bay below the castle is extremely shallow, barely sufficient to outfit small boats. There are four locations with fixed cannons, all without platforms, positioned over one chō from the water. The exact number is uncertain. On the southern sand beach of the prefecture, there are over ten positions, but they are arranged directly on the ground. Those on the left side of the salt fields are stacked in two layers on large rocks, totaling about fourteen or fifteen guns with a bore diameter of four sun and total length of over seven shaku.
Those lined up on the northernmost beach also number over ten guns, and their size surpasses the three locations. The wharf is located at the southern corner of the harbor, with large timber arranged in a T-shape, supported by rows of bronze pillars and stakes. It also resembles a bridge. The horizontal bridge is five ken long and three ken wide, the straight bridge is three ken long and over one and a half ken wide, with legs

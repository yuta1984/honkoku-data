Nine　Sitka Port
Russia's territory spans across the sea to the east (the islands belong to America), the wharf was newly established in barren land (recently created)
The people are half mixed with Western races, and their bearing truly shows the style of a great nation (the old Qiang are profound and have great ambitions), litigation is rare and there has been no death penalty to this day (capital punishment has never been established since ancient times), beasts are numerous and there is tribute earth everywhere (tribute from a hundred ri eastward has ceased)
It is also heard that there are many garrison camps for suppression, with drills every seven days thinking of war and attack (small drills every seven days, large drills every seventy days, with native chieftains personally attending each time, and land military preparations well-organized, truly enviable)

　　　Ten　Fire-wheel Ships (Steam Ships)
Covering a thousand ri in an instant (can travel four hundred ri in one day, equivalent to over a hundred ri in our country), the most spectacular sight is especially these fire-wheel ships (shaped thin and pointed like tea grinders, with no fixed measurements for size), no cloth sails are set but coal burning is provided (stone coal is used for distant travel, firewood can also be burned for nearby areas)
Copper funnels have openings that emit smoke at times (one funnel emits smoke, one funnel releases steam, standing opposite each other), the force is so fierce that favorable or contrary winds matter not (can advance even against headwinds), the mechanical ingenuity only awaits water boiling (when water boils it immediately runs, speed and slowness depend entirely on this), please stop laughing at the Liaodong swine (many people in the world possess the technical drawings), once a vessel was deployed for border defense

　　　Eleven　Anchoring in Ezo
The governor issues documents permitting Americans convenience (there are orders from Irkutsk), countrymen gather and return to court several times (their joy is like ascending to heaven)
The cunning mind for navigating sea routes has long been perfected (the Russians know all our coastal shipping routes and can even count the stones in harbors), only inviting cold ridicule in vain (when our garrison soldiers fire cannons to intimidate them, their courage all withers), what should be treasured is using the water clock to measure moments and seconds (one person on the ship throws a measuring board into the sea while another beside him holds an hourglass to measure seconds)
Clearly recognizing the confusion in the mirror (distinctly seeing the chaotic state of garrison soldiers through the telescope), treating with hostility the matter of benevolent people who go to extremes to save the drowning is also lamentable (the visitor says they escorted us with kind and generous intentions over a long journey, yet our soldiers cannot distinguish good from evil and view them like bandits - such injustice is extreme. Alas, is this failure ours alone?)

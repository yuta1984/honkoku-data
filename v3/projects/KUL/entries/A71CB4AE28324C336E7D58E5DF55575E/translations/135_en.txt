　　　Listening to the castaway Jirōkichi's story, recorded in poetry (On the 14th day of the 2nd month of Boshin year, Mr. Ishikawa brought guests to visit. Messrs. Yamada of Senju, Gotō Gorōkawa, Ikeda and others also gathered, exchanging sake and listening to tales. It was very pleasant and we dispersed after nightfall)

　　One　Fortunately, I alone survived (Of ten who left the country, only half remain alive now), looking back on those times makes my soul fade away (Without food for dozens of days, three people died), I first learned the danger of the ocean waves (Nearly becoming fish food several times), I deeply feel the kindness of the two generals (The guest calls all the native chiefs "generals")
The pitiable sight of being beaten with a hundred willow branches until blood spatters (An elderly Qiang criminal was ordered to be beaten in rotation by a hundred foot soldiers, each holding a whip), ten thousand lanterns illuminate like daylight to witness a wedding (From their temples to the roadways brightly lit, the whole village gathered to watch), I remember many customs of that distant foreign land, the hardships are too painful to speak of (Moving from lodging to lodging for meals, fully experiencing bitter suffering)

　　Two　People of the United States
Hunting whales and repairing boats heading east (The ship departed from Chukchi Island in the south), having met, we ultimately became like flesh and blood (Like old friends at first sight)
Expecting to meet again in the afterlife, sinking in sorrow (The promise made in parting sadness), earnestly entrusting the remainder of life on a lonely island (The Sannotsu Islands where one travels around)

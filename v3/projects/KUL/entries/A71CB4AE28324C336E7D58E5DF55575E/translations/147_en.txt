[The ships] passed through the strait. At this point, rifles and cannons were fired randomly like rain. However, not a single shot reached the nine ships. The foreign vessels departed leisurely, and finally opened fire. Already at a great distance from the shore, they fired one large iron ball. It indeed fell on the main hall of the domain office. The entire castle was stunned and lost their composure. The guest said, "Westerners are skilled in surveying. They do not waste ammunition on useless ground." 《This story relates to tales from before the drift ashore》

〇Twenty years ago, "France" was at war with a neighboring country, and after several years of conflict, [people] came to catch and eat cats and rats. The price of cats rose to "Haudara" 《four ryō of gold》, and the price of rats to "Rondara" 《one ryō of gold》. The guest has forgotten the name of the enemy country. It was probably Prussia.

〇When strolling along the seashore in "Kamchatka," [the guest] saw natives carrying rice bales to a warehouse, and unable to contain his eagerness to try, he helped them and carried two large bales weighing over sixteen kan each. The natives were astonished and secretly reported to their chief. The chief summoned the guest to test this, and greatly praised him. Looking at his subordinate soldiers, [the chief] asked, "Is there anyone in the unit who can carry two bales on one shoulder?" The soldiers replied, "No." Later, the guest carried three bales. He also frequently wrestled with the natives, but since they were tall and robust, each time the guest faced them he had to look up. However, they had no technique and merely pushed forward, so when he swept them left and right, they would immediately stumble and fall. Defeating them was easy. The natives cheered and said, "We cannot match Japan."

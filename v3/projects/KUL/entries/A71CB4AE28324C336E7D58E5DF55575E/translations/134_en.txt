There are barriers and fences. To go to the market streets, one must pass in front of the artillery. Behind the castle is a large temple with a great automatic bell hung. Along the coastline beside the castle, warehouses are lined up to store ship cargo. The area below the warehouses serves as a wharf. The shipyard is about half a chō away from the sea. A "bell" is hung nearby, and when gathering workers, they ring it to notify them. There is also a bell inside the castle, which is rung during emergency alerts. It is lower than the barrier and cannot be seen from outside. The military barracks consist of three connected buildings south of the town. South of the road is a sandy beach, at the end of which is a flat rock about five ken square jutting into the sea. The chief's pavilion is built on this rock and serves as a place for fishing recreation. The bay entrance can only accommodate small fishing boats. Above the shore, along the sea, is a deep forest about five to six chō long. At the forest entrance, board walkways like our "ayumi" are laid for travel. Where the forest ends, there is a clear river over ten ken wide, with crystal-clear water where many redfin culter swim upstream. Crossing a wooden bridge and proceeding several chō, there is a large pond one chō wide and six chō long, used as a place for ice skating in spring. About one ri from the town is the village of "Korushi-Injīnen." These are assimilated natives who are relatively easier to control than those living in the mountains. Generally, this town differs from "Kamchatka" and "Okhotsk" in that merchant ships from various countries gather at the port, trade flourishes, and all kinds of goods are displayed. Chinese people are also very numerous. However, their commerce lacks trading houses - everyone rents rooms to store and sell their goods, leaving once they finish selling. I also saw steamships come to the town for the first time.

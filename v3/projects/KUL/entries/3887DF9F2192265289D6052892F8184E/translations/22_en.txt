(the name) need not be mentioned. I was hired by someone who monopolized and managed one location within the gold mines, becoming a digger with an agreement to receive six silver coins per day as wages. Daily I dug along the riverbank. There was little silver, mainly digging out gold dust. The gold varied in weight, but the extremely large pieces weighed eight pounds and twelve ounces.

Regarding this weight system, when I inquired of the Dutch people residing there, they stated that in America one pound equals 121 monme, 5 bu, 2 rin in Japanese measurements, and one ounce equals 12 monme, 1 bu, 5 rin, 2 mō.

This could be exchanged for about 2,250 silver coins, with one pound exchanging for about 256 silver coins. After being employed for several days, the employer apparently lost at gambling. Though I had been employed for about forty days, I was not paid my wages. Since it was impossible to predict what rough treatment I might receive if I pressed too hard for payment, and because people's attitudes were unfavorable, I left that employment.

From then on, I cooperated with an acquaintance, and the two of us dug in the mountains. We brought what we dug each day to the inn at North Fork and sold it to gold dust buyers. This gold dust was dug up using tools like hoes. Gradually we began entering deeper into the mountains to dig, sometimes climbing about ten ri to dig. At such times we stayed overnight in the mountains like other diggers. Since there were small commercial huts at those locations, some people went there for meals, but my acquaintance and I bought wheat flour and made it into rice cakes, along with beef or vegetables.

The birds were mixed white and black in color, and there were a great many of them. At that time, they were incubating eggs and hatching them, and did not flee even when people approached. We caught these birds and ate their meat raw. On days with good weather, we would follow along the rocky shore to gather shellfish, which we used as food. When we first began living in this rock cave, it was easy to catch birds daily, but gradually they became afraid of people and would flee, making them difficult to catch. Other birds such as migratory birds and herons also came, but we had no tools for catching them. We devised various methods but could not capture them. Around late January, these birds gradually finished hatching their eggs and departed. After that, we had to traverse the treacherous rocky shores to gather shellfish and other marine life, managing to collect only small amounts at a time. Our food supply gradually became scarce.

Perhaps because of this, Denzō and Jūsuke fell ill and could barely stand, lying in the cave and constantly thinking of returning home while praying to gods and Buddha.

Around late April of that year, I believe, after continuous rain, there was a great earthquake around midday. That same day, around eight o'clock, large rocks collapsed from the mountain above our cave and fell in front of the cave entrance. We were all startled, but since we were inside the cave, no one was injured.

Around June 4th of that year, I believe, when Manjirō emerged from the cave in the morning, he spotted a ship with many white sails about ten ri offshore to the east. The three of them—Toraemon, Goemon, and Manjirō—went to higher ground, hung clothing on the end of poles, spread their arms wide, and frantically waved, hoping the ship would approach. Gradually it came closer, anchoring the main vessel about three ri offshore and launching two small boats. Unfamiliar people were aboard, gradually approaching the island.

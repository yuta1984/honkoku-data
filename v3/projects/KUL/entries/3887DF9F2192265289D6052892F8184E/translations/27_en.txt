We tried to row to shore, but the sea was rough and the wind and rain were particularly strong, making it difficult to row, so as evening came, we anchored near the mountain shadow that night to weather the storm. The next morning of the 3rd, the wind and rain calmed down, and we could see houses on the beach at that location, so around the fifth hour of the morning (around 8 AM), we rowed ashore and landed. There we encountered what appeared to be a Ryukyu person, but we could not communicate in language. We were taken to what seemed like a temporary guardhouse where we received food and other care. A person who appeared to be a Japanese official came and questioned us, so regarding our names, I identified myself as "Denzō" and gave a complete account of my birthplace and the circumstances of our drifting. We learned that the place where we had landed was called Mabuni Magiri in Ryukyu. Our personal belongings were confiscated, and we were told we would be taken elsewhere, with many officials accompanying us. Since Denzō had an eye disease and could not walk easily, he rode in a palanquin partway through the journey, while the other two walked. We traveled about two and a half ri and arrived near the government office around the ninth hour of the night (around midnight), resting on mats spread at the gate of a house. From there, we were given lodging at what seemed like a farmer's house in Onaka village. Officials came to the lodging to question us, and we gave our complete account. We were forbidden to leave that lodging and remained there. The next day, the 4th, in the morning, officials called us to the lodging for questioning, then sent us back to our quarters. About ten days passed, and we were called out again to meet with high-ranking officials. With about three people present, our personal belongings and books were examined one after another. After this was completed, we returned to our lodging and remained there. However, on the 19th of the 6th month, our belongings were re-examined as before, and on the evening of the 18th of the 7th month, accompanied by officials, we departed that place, traveled about one ri by palanquin to a port called Naha, and boarded a ship around the fifth hour of that night (around 8 PM).

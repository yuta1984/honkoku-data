In these places, I observed watermelons growing to about one shaku four or five sun in length. There are gourds, taro, sweet potatoes, corn, chives, banana plants, and along the riverbanks grows something called "akakai"—a thick rush-like plant. There is no rice or wheat, but it is said that whatever seeds are planted will grow in all four seasons in this land. The farming tools are not hoes but sword-like implements used to break up the farmland. There are no soybeans or azuki beans, but they do plant flat beans similar to what we call kidney beans in Japan. Sugar cane, which they call "tou," is planted abundantly. The stalks are about five sun in circumference and six to seven shaku in height. After harvesting, they send it to islands called Atoai and Mokai, located to the south within the same group of islands. These places are about fourteen to fifteen ri distant from Oahu, and sugar is manufactured there. Chinese workers go to these locations to produce and prepare it, then distribute it to various provinces. This sugar is of high quality without moisture, and comes in white, red, and black varieties. There is something called cotton—large trees about three ken high with trunks about two shaku in circumference around, planted at house gates and entrances. The leaves, flowers, and fruit resemble Japan's grass cotton, though the size of the fruit is not particularly different. This cotton is very white and smooth, but it is not used for thread or textiles. Instead, this cotton is used as stuffing for pillows, futon, or as a substitute for "banya."

Regarding ceremonies: From the first month to the twelfth month, there are festival days—four days per month. This refers to Honolulu, the place within Oahu where the castaways were staying.

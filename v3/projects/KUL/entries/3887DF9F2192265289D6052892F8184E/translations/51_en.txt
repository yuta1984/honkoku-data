Conditions on Luzon Island

1. Regarding the people: They are of average height, and both men and women have rather dark complexions with black hair. Their eyes are not particularly different from Japanese. Men have short hair and wear hats made of silk or cotton fashioned like tea stands, in various colors. They wear short-sleeved garments with tubular sleeves made of woolen cloth or cotton, fastened with buttons at the chest, cotton hakama-like trousers, and leather shoes. Those who appear to be officials are said to come from Spain. They wear black woolen clothing with golden tassels hanging from their shoulders, appearing as if they were in military formation, riding on box-like objects placed on carts pulled by horses, with both men and women seen riding. Women have long hair hanging down their backs in curls. Their clothing is tailored similarly to men's but extends to the hem, and they wear long waistcloths of various dyed fabrics and cotton, and shoes similar to men's. Those who appear to be sailors wear crude clothing and go barefoot without shoes.

1. Regarding food: Rice, shrimp, and other unfamiliar small fish or sliced large fish, taro, vegetables including daikon radish and pumpkin. They eat with spoons or chopsticks, which is not much different from Japan, but there is no miso.

1. Regarding house construction: All houses have tile roofs, though some have wooden or thatched roofs. Walls are plastered with white earth, and two-story buildings are also seen. The ground floor has earthen floors or wooden flooring with stools placed there. About one town (approximately 109 meters) from the coast, there is a consul official.

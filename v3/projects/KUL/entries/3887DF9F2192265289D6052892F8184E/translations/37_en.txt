About one chō from the coastline, there are two hall-like buildings measuring about fifteen ken by seven to eight ken in width. The interior has earthen floors paved with stones, and there are temple bells. Many benches are arranged in rows, and around four o'clock, they ring the bell to notify everyone. Men and women, old and young alike, gather at this place. Then a person who appears to be the leader emerges alone, dressed in woolen straight-sleeved garments, and provides instruction to farmers, craftsmen, and merchants about not neglecting their work and about proper conduct and etiquette. The castaways also attended, but they could not understand. This instructor is said to be from America or France. He normally resides in a separate house but comes to this designated place on the appointed day. There are no other ceremonies such as New Year celebrations. When taking a wife, they hold lively ceremonies with guests invited for meals of fish and meat, but we heard that the castaways never participated in such events, so we do not know the details.

Regarding temple-like structures: none were observed.

　　　　The Condition of Kinsimer Island

The men and women are all dark-skinned and naked, covering their waists with tree leaves like a sash. Some have short hair while others have long hair. Many coconut trees are seen, and they eat the coconut fruit as food. They make toy bows from this wood and craft bowstrings from tree bark. They favor all iron objects—broken iron rings, chains, and such—and trade these bows for iron goods, which they then remake into knives and other tools. They use these bows to shoot birds for food.

We conducted whaling in various places in the ocean, and in February of the same year, we moored at a place called Batan under Portuguese control, which was a small locality within Timor Island. The island was about the size of Kyushu in Japan. There were no proper harbor facilities, but houses were scattered sparsely along the coast. We purchased firewood, water, and food, stayed for about thirty days, and then departed from there. In September of the same year, we returned to New Bedford for the first time.

Regarding wages for whaling ship sailors, there are no fixed rates, and the crew size varies depending on the success or failure of the catch. For every sixteen barrels of whale oil, the captain receives one barrel, and the sailors each receive their share according to their respective proportions. I don't remember the exact amount of my wages in silver, but I received it according to that proportion. I returned to stay at the home of the aforementioned Captain Harvey, who had already returned from his voyage. As before, I helped with farm work and other tasks. During this time, the captain gave me twenty mon of Japanese currency, a mixture of four-mon coins and small copper coins. Since these were rare items, the local people in New Bedford were interested in them, so I gradually gave them away. I still possess one four-mon coin and three small coins.

[Note] When I inquired about the Japanese currency, I learned that the aforementioned Captain William H. Whitfield had obtained them during a previous whaling voyage when another whaling ship rescued Japanese castaways off the coast of Edo, Japan. The crew members had given them to the captain, who then gave them to Manjirō. He said he didn't know the details of that shipwreck incident.

There are gold mines in San Francisco, California, in North America.

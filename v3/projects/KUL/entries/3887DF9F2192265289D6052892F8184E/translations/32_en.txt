Woven fabrics are not used ordinarily but are employed for decoration. The women's complexion tends toward white, with some having a reddish tint, which again does not differ particularly from Japanese people. They wear their hair long, divided into three parts, with the center of the head rolled up and the hair at the temples on both sides made into small curves, arranged in three places total, secured with tortoiseshell combs. They pick grass flowers and insert them directly as ornaments, wear gold rings in their ears, and hang objects made of glass or gold, silver, and copper. They do not dye their teeth. Their clothing is tailored from black, white, or red cotton cloth, with one width sewn at the left and right sides, without pleats, and with the shoulder and chest area left open. They wear the long tube-sleeved garments that have existed until now, wear leg coverings, have no sash, and fasten the chest with buttons. The outer garments are mostly made of black cotton cloth, short and folded like an overcoat, though there are also long outer garments. They wear hats made of white cloth and various other fabrics, covering their heads to the extent that their faces are barely visible. Some of these hats have flowers and such embroidered on them. The clothing of lower-class people is tailored in the same way but is quite crude, not using gauze or cotton cloth. Women's ornaments are also crude. Those who appear to be courtesans have hair ornaments and other clothing that look somewhat finer. When people from other countries come to live in the same place and take wives, those people are not allowed to return to their home countries.

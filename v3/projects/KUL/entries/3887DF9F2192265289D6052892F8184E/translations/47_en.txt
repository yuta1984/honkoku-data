When whales are spotted, four smaller boats are launched. Each boat carries six harpoons and is manned by six sailors who row close to the whale. Two of the harpoons have ropes attached and are thrown to strike the whale. The fish swims around while attached, circling for about one ri, but usually returns to where it was first struck and dies there. Once dead, ropes are attached to pull it to the main ship, where it is cut into pieces. There are two oil-rendering areas on the ship with large iron cauldrons for boiling. The rendered dregs and bones are discarded into the sea. Even a large fish of twelve ken yields over eighty barrels of oil. When the ship becomes full with accumulated oil, they return to their home country. From that time, purchasing ships from various places come to buy the oil. They do not sell to other countries. Regarding the money for expenses, the ship owner provides an estimated amount when the ship departs. Foreign whales are called "sperm whales" in that country, having teeth only in the lower jaw. They are long in shape, with large ones measuring about twelve ken and smaller ones about five or six ken. In summer, they reportedly come to Japanese waters. They prefer whales found in Japanese waters. These are large, reportedly about thirteen ken in length. From four years ago, there were many whales in the Korean seas, with abundant fishing for about two years, but afterward they appear to have fled to the seas around Ezo Island, leaving no fishing there. They now fish mainly in northern waters. Regarding Manjirō, when he was staying in New Haven, he saw a steamship on the coast there. It was about ten ken long and three ken wide, built sturdily for carrying cargo and passengers.

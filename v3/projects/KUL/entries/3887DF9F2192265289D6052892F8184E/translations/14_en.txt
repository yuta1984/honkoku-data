They lived there. That place was on the opposite side of New Bedford, with houses built continuously along both sides of the river flowing to the coast for about two ri. The buildings were all board-roofed, either two-story or single-story houses. There were many whaling ship captains and various merchant houses, making it a prosperous place. Regarding myself, the captain advised me to pursue learning, and since there was no immediate prospect of returning to Japan, he said that studying would be beneficial and convenient, and greeted me with the intention of making appropriate arrangements.

Since it was difficult to send me directly to school, they decided to first send me to a preparatory school. Though I don't recall the exact date, I went with the captain about one and a half chō through the town streets to a house with a gate structure.

There were rooms with board flooring that could accommodate about five or six buildings' worth of people, where approximately twenty people gathered to practice reading aloud. All had seats provided, with the teacher on a raised platform giving instruction and reading books on astronomy, geography, and other subjects. I commuted from the captain's house, returning in the evening, and practiced for about ten months. The captain then told me I could now attend the regular school. Though I don't recall the exact date, I went with the captain about three chō through the town to a house with a gate structure about twenty ken square.

The teacher was from that place, but when there were substitute teachers, they would come from elsewhere to provide instruction. Every morning, one hundred or fifty to sixty people would come, with the teacher on a raised platform while everyone sat on seats arranged on the board flooring to practice reading aloud. I also commuted daily from the captain's house, practicing reading aloud books on astronomy and geography. After about two months, I became quite proficient in understanding. The aforementioned captain was employed on whaling ships with several other people.

Spanish mackerel, carp, crucian carp, and other fish unfamiliar in our homeland are also prepared by salt-boiling. Fish and fowl are available as well. Stoves are made of stone, cooking is done in iron pots, and firewood is used for fuel.

Regarding house construction: The timber they cut is called "hau," which resembles paulownia wood. Pillars are set directly into the ground, and roofs are thatched with grass or sometimes shingled with boards. There are no walls—only board siding, or in the case of lower-class homes, siding made of grass. White clay walls are not seen. Floors are wooden planking with separate sleeping quarters constructed. Farmers' and fishermen's houses have no floors—on the dirt floor they spread mats woven from something called "akakai," which is like thick rushes, and sleep on these. Mosquito nets are made from cloth, cotton, and such. Well-appointed houses and official buildings use tatami mats woven from akakai. House construction involves setting pillars on stone foundations, with both two-story and single-story buildings, some with gate-like structures. For boards and pillar wood, pine, cedar, cypress and such are seen—much of this is timber brought over from America and other states. Stone is quarried from coastal areas during low tide. Regarding carpentry tools, they have various items like planes, saws, and hand axes. Their usage is entirely by pushing forward—there is no pulling forward motion. Chisels do not differ particularly from Japanese chisels. They have no ink lines (sumitsubo)—instead they stretch string and mark with white powder.

During the castaways' stay, there were three fires, but these were small fires affecting only two or three houses. On such occasions, they carry water in buckets and such to extinguish the flames.

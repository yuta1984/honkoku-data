1. Regarding the castaway Manjiro: At the age of thirteen, he departed from his home country on the fifth day of the New Year for fishing, encountered a storm, and drifted to an uninhabited island. While on the island, he was rescued by a North American ship and thereafter sailed around various foreign countries. Originally the son of a fisherman, he was raised by the seashore from his youth and engaged in maritime work. However, since he had no proper understanding of worldly matters before leaving the country and was raised to adulthood under the care of foreigners, his memory of Japanese goods, utensils, and even plants, trees, birds, and beasts was thin. Having been aboard ships from a young age, he naturally learned the American language. In the year of the Dog (1850), he departed from Oahu in October and landed in the Ryukyu Kingdom. During his stay there, he met people from Satsuma, but he had forgotten Japanese kana characters and other writing, which had been interrupted. As he gradually came to understand Japanese again, when asked about foreign conditions, he found it difficult to comprehend all the forms and similar general matters that had been compared and exemplified up to that point, and was troubled by this. Since understanding comes gradually through observation and experience, there may be inadequacies in his account of foreign conditions.

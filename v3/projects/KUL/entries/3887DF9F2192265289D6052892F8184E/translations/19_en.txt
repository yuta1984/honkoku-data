Regarding the digging of placer gold in the mountains, I had long been aware that the republican government of that state had announced that this could be done at one's own discretion. If I were to sail again on a whaling ship and visit places near the gold mines, I wanted to go there to observe the location and, depending on the circumstances, try gold digging myself. Fortunately, there were stores in New Bedford that sold digging tools, and if purchased there, the cost in silver would be low, whereas near the gold mines, such tools were unavailable and expensive. So I bought various tools in New Bedford for ten pieces of silver and kept them with me.

In October of the same year, I consulted and was hired as a sailor on a ship that was loading lumber and other ship materials in New Bedford to transport them to California in North America. I brought my personal belongings along with the aforementioned digging tools aboard. I don't remember the captain's name, but the ship was called Franklin, with a crew of thirty-eight. In late October, we departed from New Bedford harbor, sailed around the cape of South America, and in April 1850 [marginal note: corresponding to the third month of Kaei 3, year of the dog], we moored at Valparaíso, a Spanish territory in the same continent. The harbor appeared to be about one ri wide and ten ri long. About thirty American and English whaling ships and merchant vessels were moored there, and there seemed to be about a thousand houses. This place has a consul from North America.

[Note] This "consul" is an official title referring to officials who are stationed in foreign countries, as explained by the castaway Manjirō.

We stayed for about eight days, took on firewood and water, departed from there, and in May of the same year, [arrived at] California in the same continent.

and so forth are recorded as stated.

The circumference appeared to be about one ri. Houses were sparsely visible, and when they rowed to the island in a small boat, many islanders gathered together. Both men and women were naked, covering themselves with tree leaves like loincloths. Their skin color was generally dark, and they brought wooden toy bows, gesturing as if wanting to sell them, but no words could be understood. They favored all iron objects such as broken iron rings or iron chains, apparently to remake them into knives and such. The sailors bought these bows and gave broken iron objects in return. I also obtained a bow, giving in exchange something that had been distributed to everyone by the sailors. This was intended to be presented to the ship captain's children upon returning to Japan. Small islands were visible here and there, similarly barren islands, and we heard that all were self-governing places. They anchored the ship for about two days, took on firewood and water, and engaged in whaling in nearby waters.

In March of the same year, the ship anchored at Kian Island, a Spanish territory.
This Kian Island is the same Kian Island that Denzō and Goemon had mentioned the previous year.

The circumference appeared to be about thirty ri, and the harbor seemed to extend about five ri. Shoals were visible in various places, with about three hundred houses, and the condition of the dwellings was similar to Hawaii. No foreign ships called at this port at all. They stayed for about thirty days, took on firewood and water, departed from that place and sailed the Pacific Ocean, engaging in fishing for about seven months. Leaving the Japan Sea behind and fishing while heading south for about two months, they anchored at an island called Emiyō, a British territory. The circumference appeared to be about forty ri, at a harbor-like place, with about three hundred houses

We engaged in whaling at sea for about three months, and in February 1847 (corresponding to the first month of Kōka 4), we moored our ship at the aforementioned Kian Island, took on firewood and water, and stayed for about thirty days. We departed from that place and in March of the same year, we sailed into Luzon Island. The entrance to the harbor appeared to be about forty to fifty ri in circumference, with houses too numerous to count. Dozens of merchant ships from China, England, and other countries were moored there, and warships were also visible.

This island was said to be under Spanish control, with fortifications facing the sea where stones appeared to be cannon muzzles. Since we were to deal with an American consul official, the captain went ashore, and while the ship was moored, I frequently went ashore as a messenger for various business matters to visit the consul official.

The name of this coastal area was said to be Manila, with many commercial establishments including cloth shops, rice shops, sake shops, pottery shops, vegetable shops, umbrella shops, and others, as well as brothels. I saw Spanish, American, English, Dutch, and Chinese people. About one chō from the coast was the consul's house, a spacious residence with an impressive gate, though I don't remember it clearly. I once bought a hat for personal use at an umbrella shop there. We stayed for about three months before departing from that place.

We moored at a small island called Batan, about thirty ri away under Luzon's control, to purchase pigs. This place appeared to have about fifty houses, thatched-roof dwellings, and the people were similar to those of Luzon. Since I did not go ashore, I don't know the details. The captain bought a rattan bentwood container when he went ashore, which he gave to me. This island was about two ri in circumference, and we stayed for about two days. From there, we spent about five months in the Pacific Ocean near Japan...

They would pound these foods for us to eat. Side dishes consisted of pork, chicken, fish and other seafood that were salt-boiled. These were provided through the office's instructions, with neighboring families taking care of us and bringing food from time to time. The house where we stayed belonged to a subordinate official named Kaukabai, we were told.

Regarding Denzō, while his name in his homeland was Fudeno-jō, since it was difficult for the Oahu (Hawaiian) people to pronounce, his name was changed to something easier to call using phonetic characters. We stayed there under their care for about half a year, but since we were not doing any work and felt bad about being cared for indefinitely, we all discussed that we each wanted to earn our own living. When we presented this matter to the aforementioned subordinate official Kaukabai, he said that while unfamiliar work would be difficult, our request was reasonable, so we should work, and if we encountered any difficulties, he would take care of us again.

All four of us remained at our previous lodging and were employed daily in various places nearby, doing domestic work, cleaning, and such tasks. Initially we received old clothing and such, but gradually we made friendly acquaintances, and as we became accustomed to the work, we sometimes even stayed overnight at our employers' places. Later we began receiving silver coins as wages, and with these wages we each lived as bachelors.

Under such circumstances, seven years ago around the seventh or eighth month of the year of the boar, Jūsuke began suffering from illness. When we spoke about this matter to our friendly acquaintances and also to Kaukabai, a doctor came and examined his pulse, but concluded that proper care would be difficult to provide.

We loaded official cargo and miscellaneous goods. The supervising officials on board were Lord Uji Jinsuke from the ship administration office, and his subordinate Lord Katayama Eizō. The lead navigator was Gozaemon from Shirume Village (possibly Shirimi Village) in Oku District of the same province. The sailors included: Shōemon (possibly Yaemon) from the same village, his assistant Yoshimatsu, Yakichi from the same village, his brother Yaichi, Eikichi from the same village, Ishibe from the same village, Chiyomatsu from the same village, Bunkichi from the same village, Nisaburō from the same village, Otokichi from the same village, Saijirō from an unknown village in Kojima District of the same province, Rihachi from Fukushima Village in an unknown district of the same province, Katsunosuke from Hamada Kitayama Village in an unknown district of Sanuki Province, Isejirō from Matsuno-ura in Hiroshima, Geishū, Sōkichi from Tanokubi Village in an unknown district of Chōshū, and myself—totaling nineteen crew members aboard the ship. We departed from Okayama on the twelfth day of the eighth month in the year of the Tiger, anchored at Shirume Village (the home of lead navigator Gozaemon) until the nineteenth, and departed from Shirume Village on the twentieth.

We departed from the same province on the twenty-third, anchored at Yura-uchi in Kii Province on the twenty-sixth, and departed from there on the twenty-eighth.

However, from around seven o'clock in the evening of the twenty-ninth, the weather changed and a great north wind arose. While we were dealing with this, the ship gradually drifted toward the open sea, and around the hour of the Ox that same night, the wind grew even stronger. Thinking that nothing more could be done, I consulted with the captain about throwing overboard the upper cargo, but he firmly refused, saying it could not be done. However, as the ship was clearly becoming endangered, I petitioned the supervising official to jettison the upper cargo, the retainers' goods, and approximately four to five hundred koku of rice, and to lower the sails. But the wind was so strong that we could hardly lower them, so we threw whatever items were at hand at the sails to tear them and let the wind pass through, then managed to lower the sails. Even after doing this, the wind continued to blow...

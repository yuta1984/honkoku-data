The wind grew ever stronger and the waves became higher, so that even those on the oars were drenched up to their waists by the waves. All crew members were worried and unsettled, and though night passed into day, the wind did not calm in the slightest. Therefore, we again threw overboard the official cargo and rice to lighten the ship and hoped to rest for a while. When two or three men had come down from the oars, around four o'clock in the afternoon of the last day of the month, there was a terrible sound from the stern. When we looked in alarm, we saw that the rudder had broken and about six feet of water rushed in at once. The ship was about to capsize, so we threw four anchors and two large ropes into the water at once. The ship finally righted itself, but the wind and waves did not abate in the slightest. With the rudder gone, the mast had become more of a hindrance, so we tried to cut it down with axes and other tools. However, in the midst of such fierce wind and waves, we could not work freely. While we struggled with this, everything became scattered and damaged, and the sailors were exhausted from the previous night's turmoil, but we could not leave things as they were.

The supervising official lent us his sword, and with it we made cuts in two or three places. As we were cutting, the cuts began to crack and the mast fell sideways, catching on the ship's railings and crushing about two or three ken of the railings. We cut away the rigging and the mast drifted away. We then repaired the railings and continued sailing, bailing out the water until around eight o'clock that night. The next day, the wind and waves were equally fierce. We again threw overboard cargo rice, repaired the damaged areas, and continued drifting. On the third day of the ninth month, a severe northwest wind blew up, and we threw overboard the remaining cargo rice one after another. After that, we continued throwing away a little bit each day. For several days, the wind was truly terrible—so bad that we could barely climb up to the oars. Great waves crashed over the ship, making it extremely dangerous. Ultimately, with no hope of rescue, we all gathered together, resolved ourselves to fight to the death, and steeled our hearts. Two or three days before this, small birds with white bodies and long beaks came swooping down from the sky through the wind and waves.

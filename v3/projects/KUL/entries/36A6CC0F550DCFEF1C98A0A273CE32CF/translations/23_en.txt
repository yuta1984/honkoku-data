[Letter]

Regarding my domain of Tenma Village in Fuji District, Suruga Province, from dawn on the 8th of this month there were strong winds and heavy rain. Around 9 o'clock in the daytime, due to an avalanche, Mount Fuji roared and water suddenly rushed out, flattening both rice fields and dry fields alike, with houses also becoming flooded. The situation appeared to be gradually receding like withdrawing water. However, around 8 o'clock again, the mountaintop suddenly shook, it became dark as night, and before long floods and burning sand came rushing down. Large rocks and big trees fell backwards and rushed out, burying the thoroughfares of villages mixing both imperial and private domains, as well as cooperative waterworks, wooden weirs, and valley streams to a depth of roughly one jō seven to eight shaku to over two jō. Over half the rice fields collapsed, farmhouses were also flooded, and people and horses were likely swept downstream. Grain crops flowed out, and the extent of damaged rice field areas and the number of people and livestock who died by drowning cannot be determined. I will investigate the details and report later. I hereby report this matter first. The above.

Regarding my magistrate's office territories in Kai Province, Tsuru District: Kamiyoshida Village, Shimoyoshida Village, Daimyōmi Village, Komyōmi Village, Shikadome Village, Arakura Village, Shinobugusa Village, and Matsuyama Village - these eight villages are located in the foothills area of Mount Fuji. From around 6 o'clock on the morning of the 8th of last month, there were strong winds and heavy rain, and particularly as it was the season for snowmelt floods, following ancient precedent, village officials went out with large numbers of laborers to prepare countermeasures against the snowmelt flooding. Around 9 o'clock, Mount Fuji began shaking, and suddenly snowmelt water along with large rocks, big trees, gravel, and sand rushed out across the entire foothill village area. In a short time it pressed close to the residential village, so people became distraught and each took their elderly and children to flee to higher ground. Fortunately, there were no injuries to people or livestock. However, not only rice fields but even farmers' houses were buried in gravel, or earth and gravel was pushed up to floor level. The newly harvested grain and clothing that had been stored, as well as all household goods and tools, were completely washed away. Large numbers of people gathered in various places and fell into starvation, so they filed complaints. I immediately dispatched deputies and agents, had nearby undamaged villages provide mutual assistance with food, and had them investigate the details through observation. 132 houses were completely destroyed, buried in sand up to the eaves, and it's unclear whether even their doors and sliding screens were washed away. The remainder had earth and sand up to floor level, but since the dwellings were still quite habitable, a total of 33 households with over 590 people were distributed proportionally to be taken in, and shelter from rain and dew was provided for now. However, regarding food supplies, even the nearby undamaged villages were unable to provide mutual assistance due to last year's situation. Particularly among the eight villages, Shikadome Village, Arakura Village, Shinobugusa Village, Matsuyama Village, and Kamiyoshida Village only had their damaged fields and public works washed away, while the farmers' houses remained undamaged. Therefore, I report this matter. The above.

5th month of the Horse year, Shibata Zennosuke

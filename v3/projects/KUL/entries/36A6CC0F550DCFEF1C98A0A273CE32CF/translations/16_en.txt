A powder-like substance was applied, and then a large amount of blood was drawn from that spot. By continuing this treatment for about seven days, his appetite improved and he made a complete recovery. He was also given decoctions to drink, two small sake cups worth per day. The people with edema were also given decoctions to take. The physician wore a black garment-like cloth on top and a chintz garment-like cloth below, with a hat made of woolen cloth - a respectful foreign-style headpiece. On the 120th day, we were told "Tomorrow you will be sent back, and you should be able to return to your country in two or three years." We then requested, "In that case, please send us to China." The next day we departed from Luzon. The ship could carry over 1,000 koku, with its exterior wrapped in red leather, and all parts touching the water covered in copper.

Both platforms constantly had one person stationed on top. At sea we traveled about seventy ri daily for about seven days. We saw various countries and islands in the ocean, but did not learn their names. On the seventh day we arrived at a place called Macao. When this was announced, officials appeared and after confirmation we disembarked. The town layout and appearance of the houses were generally similar to Luzon. Many Chinese people come to this place. Some locals had braided hair with brass ornaments. When we arrived, they brought Chinese people to serve as interpreters, but since language did not get through at all, they investigated in detail how we had drifted here. From what Jinsuke had been given, the Chinese also wrote that "You must have suffered great hardship, but now that you are close to your homeland, this is cause for joy." We gained strength and requested the Macao people to let the Chinese people keep us there, but the language did not get through.

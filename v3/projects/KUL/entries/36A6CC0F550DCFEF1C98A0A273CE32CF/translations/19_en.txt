Besides one lower-ranking official, there were boat captains and sailors, and on another boat were we fourteen people along with boat captains, sailors, and others totaling nine people. Both boats were roofed boats with glass sliding doors. The officials' boat had curtains of this country hung and flew the flag of Canton, while our boat flew a flag indicating that Japanese people were aboard. At night, as in Japan, we remained vigilant and hung round lanterns. Every two days or so of travel, the officials would go ashore and obtain four or five kan of money to use for expenses at various places. There were villages at various points along the riverbank. On the seventeenth day after leaving Canton, we went ashore and were placed in palanquins enclosed with woolen cloth - heavy people were carried by four men, light ones by two - and traveled about eight ri along mountain paths to stay at a place called Tsukoyama.

This place was also a large territory. From there we traveled overland for one day, then went out to the river again. From Canton we had traveled by river boat, and except for three days of walking overland, we traveled by river boat for sixty days, arriving at a place called Safu on the sixty-third day in total. From Canton to Safu was said to be one river, but we were told that going entirely by river would actually take longer, so we traveled overland bit by bit. During overland travel, when we rested at post stations,

From (the phases of the moon), we knew it was mid-month, and thinking of moonless evenings as the end and beginning of months, when we counted the days, it was around mid-February of the year of the Rooster. Again officials came and took away one young man named Fujizo to somewhere unknown. Around that time, within a period of more than ten days, Kosuke, Saizo, Kyujiro, Matsuzo, and Teishiro also died one after another. In total, nine people had died, four had been separated from us while alive, leaving only seven of us remaining. As we spent our days in this manner, we approached the guards asking them to "please return us to Japan."

We pleaded morning and evening. Around what seemed to be early March, dozens of people came on a ship and put all seven of us aboard without exception. Since we had been consistently asking to "please return us to Japan," we felt hopeful and joyfully hurried aboard the vessel. With about ten sailors including the helmsman and crew, we set sail from that harbor, raising sails at three locations as we proceeded. It appeared to be particularly favorable tailwinds as we headed south, sailing for about twenty days along coastal waters near land, then for two days across the open sea.

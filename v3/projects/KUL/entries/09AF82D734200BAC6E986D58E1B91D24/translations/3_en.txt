1. Around the hour of the sheep on New Year's Day of the year of the rat, when a fishing boat from Tsunoshima in Choshu came to Ashiya, they reported that a Chinese ship had already been drifting in the distant waters off Hagi, and that even small local fishing boats should not pass near the Chinese ship. Particularly because the official investigation of offshore commerce was strict, fishing boats also found it difficult to go out to sea.

Such was their account. There was talk that the Chinese ship that drifted in the distant waters off Oshima in the previous twelfth month was surely this same vessel.

1. In early February of the same year, reports came from various islands that a Chinese ship could occasionally be seen in the distant waters, and orders were given that if the ship were indeed sighted, the vigilance personnel should be dispatched from Ashiya. Under these circumstances, on the 15th day of the 2nd month, reports came from the Oshima garrison and local islands that a Chinese ship could be seen in the distant waters, so on the 16th day the aforementioned vigilance guard was dispatched to Ashiya.

While they caught turtles and boiled them in salt water, resting for about ten days, their strength gradually returned to normal. Wanting to see the conditions of the island, the six men boarded a small boat and sailed around it. At this time, they found a single board of camphor wood, about four fathoms long, five inches thick, and three feet wide. This would become the bridge to carry these six men back to Japan.

Now this island had a circumference of about ten ri, with mountains higher than those of Izu Oshima. There was also an area facing southwest that opened up, about three cho wide, with one location suitable as a harbor that could moor twenty to thirty ships. About one ri away were three small islands, with depths of about two fathoms at low tide and four fathoms at high tide. Within the island there was a small river two to three ken wide, with no shortage of water, and many stones in the rocky sea, vermillion in color, some as large as a fist. There was one location with about one cho of land suitable for rice fields, and other areas that appeared suitable for slash-and-burn fields, but there were no signs of inhabitants, nor any traces of former habitation, so it must be an island where people had never lived.

Among fish and shellfish were black sea bream, mullet, sharks, lobsters about three feet long, octopus, and other large and small turtles, as well as coastal fish like those of the main island, and limpets and other shellfish attached to rocks. During the second and third months, many whales were also observed. The abundance of natural products was already as described, so if they had sturdy ships and several days' worth of rice provisions to harvest these benefits and return, they could immediately establish their fortunes. The regret of entering a treasure mountain only to return empty-handed was beyond words. The climate was one season warmer than the main island, with February and March equal to the heat of May and June, and April already extremely hot, so hot that one couldn't step on the stones, so they constantly went naked and had no need for clothing. For food, they had turtles, fish, pigeons, and birds resembling night herons

Of course, there were no utensils at all, so they had to grab with their hands what was cooked in a large pot and eat it. This manner was truly no different from feeding cattle and horses. Also, guards were constantly present, restricting their coming and going at all times and strictly guarding the gates, so it was just like guilty people imprisoned in a jail.

Meanwhile, one native who appeared to be of some social standing came in and gestured, saying

　　Regarding the inquiry about how large the island is.
One: The circumference of that island appears to be about one ri. The height of the island mountain is about three chō. It is essentially a volcanic mountain, extremely steep, and of course the mountain peak appears to be constantly burning, with smoke rising from it. There are no large trees either. From the middle of the mountain downward, there are only mulberry and elaeagnus trees, and no other trees at all. Besides these, miscanthus and bush clover grow thickly, but it was impossible to build huts, so we cut and spread miscanthus inside the rock caves. The caves are about one chō up from the shore. For firewood we used mulberry wood or miscanthus; we did not burn elaeagnus wood as it is disliked for fuel even in your locality.

　　Since the rice mentioned above was only a small amount, what did you usually eat for your meals? - this inquiry.

One: Regarding meals, as I mentioned before, we survived by eating fish and birds. These birds are ones that we had never seen before, not only in your locality but anywhere else we had been. Their overall plumage is white, their shape is like that of a swan, with sharp beaks and long legs. When they spread their flight feathers left and right, they span five or six shaku. Since we do not know the name of these birds, we have been calling them "large birds." When asked what they feed on, upon careful observation, we found that round large crabs emerge from between the rocks along the shores of the islands. They are persimmon-colored, and the large ones are about the size of a kemari ball, though we observed various sizes. We also caught and boiled these to try eating them, but they tasted somewhat bitter, and moreover had no meat - only something like miso or water-soaked material inside the shell, so there was nothing edible. Therefore, we stopped catching crabs after that. The aforementioned birds pierce and crush these crabs with their beaks for food. Even when we approached close to these large birds, they would not fly away, so we killed them with our nail crowbars. During what seemed to be summer, for about two or three months, they disappear from the island - perhaps migrating somewhere - and during that time we would push nails

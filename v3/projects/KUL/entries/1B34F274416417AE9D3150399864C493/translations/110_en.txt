They arranged all available containers to catch and store the rainwater, finally relieving their thirst of several days. Drifting in unknown waters where not even the shadow of a bird could be seen across the monochrome blue ocean, they welcomed the New Year. On the twenty-fifth day of the first month of the Hinoe-Inu year (1766), they first spotted mountains, so everyone rejoiced and steered toward them. The following day around noon, they were finally able to reach land.

The three men landed and looked around in all directions, wondering what country this might be. When they could see a few houses in the distance, fifty or sixty people with their hair in topknots, dressed in Chinese clothing, and each carrying spears with handles, came rushing toward them and surrounded the three. Although they tried to explain that they were Japanese castaways, since they could not communicate with each other, Shichibē crouched down and wrote "Japanese people - no water" in the sand. The locals seemed to understand and led them to the shade of a mountain, showing them where water flowed. They drank this and relieved their thirst. At that time, a person who appeared to be an official came leading many people and gave instructions. Using ship materials, they erected a hut on the beach and had all the ship equipment, clothing, rice bales, and other items carried and placed outside it.

At that time, they wrote and showed "Please allow us to return to Japan," but this was not understood at all. The official left as he was, and from evening they assigned eight or nine guards, also sending some cooked fish. They burned ship materials to cook rice and finally relieved their hunger.

The next day two officials came, so they wrote and showed "Three dead people on ship." Five laborers were sent to the ship, so Yosaburo and Kyūheiji accompanied them, placed the three corpses in one water barrel, carried them to the mountains about one ri away, and buried them. During this time, Shichibē alone remained at the hut and underwent inspection by the officials. They confiscated his money - six ryō and two bu in gold, and 1,200 mon in copper coins - sealed his other belongings, and left.

Around the second day of the second month, one of the aforementioned officials came, had laborers carry rice and personal effects, led the three men about three ri away, gave them an empty house in a village called Nanētsu within Annan Province, stored the rice and miscellaneous goods inside, and assigned guards - ten during the day and fourteen at night.

Along the route, there were some places with rolling hills, but it was generally flat, with road widths of seven to eight ken or about ten ken each, well-maintained and open. The post stations along the way were inferior to those in Japan, but not particularly bad. When crossing the border between Tartary and Ming China, there was something called the Great Wall. This Great Wall was not built of stone, but was made of stacked tiles. It was about twelve to thirteen ken high, made of tiles three to four sun thick packed with mortar, appearing solid like pottery glazed with medicine, and though it looked extremely old, there was no damage anywhere. At the passageways, this stone wall was carved out in circles, with gate towers built above. These circular sections also appeared glazed like pottery, so smooth that even fingernails could not catch on them. After thirty-five or thirty-six days, they traveled along the coast for about a day. Though there were small streams here and there, there were no rivers requiring ferry crossings.

They were constantly provided with three laborers to handle various services, and each person was given daily rations of one sho of white rice, one kin of pork, wheat flour, buckwheat flour, tea, sake, two geese, firewood as needed, fish, vegetables, miso, salt, rice, etc. They were provided without shortage with silk clothing, cotton bedding, hats, tabi socks and other garments.

Now, Beijing's royal castle was said to be about six ri square in Japanese measurements, with stone walls built high all around, entrances carved out in circles as passageways, gate towers built above, and cannons installed in places around the perimeter. In the center, a moat was dug around an area of about twenty cho square, with many palace buildings constructed within. There were four gates on the four sides, with three bridges built at three of the gates, but at the main entrance gate alone, there was a large stone bridge.

Although their frustration was beyond remedy, they could only submit to whatever the natives did to them. After a while,
fourteen or fifteen of them brought torn padded robes that had been taken from the ship, and individually
untied their sashes, made them change into good clothing, and stripped away everything that remained—short swords, amulets, and wallets—
leaving nothing behind, then scattered sand and departed. The actions
of these barbarians who knew neither mercy nor compassion were so detestable that calling them hateful would be an understatement. During this time they felt barely alive, but everyone got up
and watched them leave, knowing that even if they didn't fall to the blade, death by starvation was near. With no one
to blame, they simply chanted nembutsu through the night, saying to each other that if they were to die, let it be together, and
the night gradually dawned.
After daybreak, when they looked around, they saw
fruit like chestnuts growing thickly. The branches were heavy with fruit, so driven by their attachment to life,
wanting to pick and eat them, they made their way to the base of the trees, each picking some
and putting it in their mouths. The taste was sweet and sour, and though not particularly delicious, it seemed

would float to the surface gasping, and fishermen would cast nets to catch them—this being the local custom. It was said to be highly poisonous to humans. Yet having eaten it with only slight
suffering, and it even serving somewhat to fill their bellies, must have been because the gods and Buddha had not yet abandoned them.
Thus, afterward they sought out nuts from trees and roots from grasses in the nearby hills and fields
to stave off hunger, and within days their strength gradually began to recover. The time was
the beginning of our country's New Year, still the cold season, but this island's climate was just like the
warm weather of around May. Therefore, though everyone had had their clothing stripped away earlier and wore only a single layer of torn
lined robes, they did not feel cold at all.
Thus one day around the fifth hour (8 AM in modern time), five or six natives came again and approached them

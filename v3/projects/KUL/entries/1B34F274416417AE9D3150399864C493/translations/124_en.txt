We continued to survive in this way. Later, large pieces of timber would drift ashore, so we would retrieve them and hollow them out with nails to make them like buckets, and in these too we would collect and store rainwater for drinking water.

Then, around what seemed to be late autumn of the following year, an abandoned ship of unknown nationality drifted near due to strong winds and waves, crashed against the rocks at the shore, and immediately broke apart. When we found this and went close to look, we saw rice scattered among the rocks, so we gathered up about sixty bales that we could reach and were carrying them to our dwelling caves when the waves became strong again and pulled the bales we had collected back toward the open sea. We managed to retrieve only twenty or thirty bales.

With this rice we sustained ourselves for some time. When that too was consumed, we again survived on fish, birds, and seaweed. Besides the rice retrieved from that abandoned ship, torn cotton sails and ship planks would occasionally drift ashore. We also collected these items and put them to various uses. When asked whether during our twenty-plus years on the island we had seen any trading ships passing on the sea, as I answered above, nothing drifted ashore except for that abandoned ship.

There were no other incidents at all.

Regarding the rice we had retrieved, since there was no place to dry it, we stacked the bales as they were inside the caves and stored them there. However, among them was one bale of unhulled rice, though we were completely unaware of this. Around what seemed to be the following spring, when it became quite warm, that bale of rice hulls sprouted and began to grow shoots. When we examined it, we found it was unhulled rice, so we took nails we had previously extracted from ship planks and fashioned them into crowbar-like tools to use as hoes. In places between the rocks where miscanthus grew thickly, where there were patches of soil one or two tsubo in area, we dug holes with these large nail tools and planted the sprouted rice hulls. We used fish and bird entrails or the water from washing them as fertilizer, and found that they gradually bore fruit. So each year when it became warm in what seemed like spring, we would plant seeds, and it appeared we could harvest about three or four to of unhulled rice per year.

Thus we harvested every year, but we never ate this rice in normal times, saving it instead to treat the sick. When needed, we would cook small amounts of the unhulled rice into gruel and use it as medicine.

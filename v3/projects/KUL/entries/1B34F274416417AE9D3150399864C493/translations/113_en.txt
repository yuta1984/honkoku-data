This is constantly used for entertaining guests as well, so with the red juice, everyone's lips are stained and teeth blackened. The four men also tried this, and found it slightly astringent but very refreshing in the mouth. For clothing, the poor use cotton while the middle class and above use silk gauze, with tailoring the same as the Chinese. Generally, they do not shave their hair or beards and use no oil. Men and women wear the same type of clothing, but men wear metal ornaments and women hang earrings, so men and women can be distinguished at a glance. One day in Hoi An they saw a girl of about five years old having earrings put on for the first time. A nail-like needle was used to pierce holes in her earlobes, bleeding-stopping medicine was applied, and paper twists were inserted, but perhaps there was not much pain, as the girl did not cry or show distress at all.

Rice cultivation involves harvesting twice a year: one crop is planted in the eleventh month and harvested in the third month, while another is planted in the fifth month and harvested in the ninth month. After one harvest, the field rests once, and they cultivate alternately. When first sowing seeds, they make seedbeds in dry fields to sow, and rice planting is like in our country, but they hold the seedlings upside down, separate the roots and plant them by hand. When harvesting, they cut only the grain heads, bundle them into small sheaves, have cattle trample them to remove the hulls, and do not use rice flails. Once when they drew and showed a Chinese person our country's rice flails, he answered that his country used the same method. To plow fields, they have two oxen pull one plow, with no nose-leader. The cattle are somewhat larger compared to those from our country, with some differences in form. Hoes, spades, mattocks and such are almost the same as in our country. As for crops, there is no wheat or millet at all, but soybeans, adzuki beans, millet, sorghum, greens, radish, sweet potato, eggplant, peppers, bottle gourd, watermelon and such are the same as in our country, and various vegetables are grown continuously throughout the year.

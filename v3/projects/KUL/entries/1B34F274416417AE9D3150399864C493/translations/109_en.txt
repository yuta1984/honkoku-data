Not only had he stolen their money, but thinking of his heartlessness in abandoning them without a backward glance filled them with indescribable anger, and their regret at having trusted him was beyond comparison. However, they received word from officials that three men from Onahama in Iwamae District, Ōshū Province had drifted to this place, so the three of them hurried to visit them. Having drifted across ten thousand li of waves and barely been blown to this shore, everything they saw reminded them of their homeland, and in this time of endless worry, even just hearing "Japan" was heartwarming, let alone meeting acquaintances from Onahama in Ōshū, a neighboring region separated by only ten-odd li. This was such an extraordinary coincidence and fateful connection that words could not express it - they felt as if they had met their own parents and siblings. For a while they continued telling each other of their hardships up to this point, and together lamented that they might become dust in a foreign land. All shed tears, but endless lamenting would accomplish nothing, so they said "If your boat is damaged, please share our vessel," and brought those three people back with them. Thereafter, all nine lived together in the stuffy ship's hold.

When they inquired about the background of those three men, they too had set sail in the same year (the second year of Meiwa, year of the rooster) in the eleventh month, attempting to cross from Onahama in Iwamae District, Ōshū Province to Chōshi in Shimōsa Province. Six men including the village headman Zenshirō and supervisor Shichibē had boarded the twelve-tan sail vessel Sumiyoshi-maru, loaded with 430 bales of rice. After departing, from that same midnight they encountered headwinds and were in desperate straits. Then on the morning of the day after next, with fierce westerly winds and high waves, they damaged their rudder and broke their oars, unable to advance or retreat freely. Except for twenty-five or twenty-six bales of rice they kept, they threw everything else into the sea. All cut their hair, and Shichibē threw his short sword into the sea, earnestly praying for the sea god's rescue. However, the wind direction changed repeatedly and showed no signs of abating. During approximately thirty days of drifting aimlessly, there had been no rain for a long time, so from around the twelfth day their drinking water gradually ran out. Zennosuke and Jinshirō had already died of thirst, so they wrapped them in straw matting and placed them in a corner of the boat - their sadness was beyond words.
On the night of the twenty-sixth, it rained a little, so they gathered all possible containers - small boats, buckets, and every vessel available.

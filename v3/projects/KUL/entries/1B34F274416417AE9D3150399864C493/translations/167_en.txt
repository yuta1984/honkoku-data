were granted gold, could summon their wives at will, had no need to help with work at the cultivation grounds, and were to live peacefully without duties for the time being. They were ordered not to speak carelessly to others about foreign countries. Moreover, regarding the surviving wife of Koichi, who died of illness in Nemuro, in his home village of Minamiwakamatsumura in Kawakuma District, Ise Province, under the jurisdiction of Lord Ishikawa Hyūga-no-kami, as a reward for maintaining her chastity for thirteen years and diligently farming more than four koku of rice fields,
she was granted ten pieces of silver and all of Koichi's belongings, as ordered on the fifteenth day of the eighth month of the same year. Thus one woman spent her days as a widow in her hometown, while two men lived out their remaining years in the medicinal garden, with fortune and misfortune blooming separately like two colors in west and east—such is the unpredictable way of the world.

●Mainichi Newspaper (August 10th) The author, serving as editor-in-chief of Shōkokumin, wielded his skilled pen in his spare time to collect and compile ancient tales of our ships drifting to foreign lands and encountering dangers during the Tokugawa period. This is the first volume. The author's intention is to familiarize children with maritime affairs and serve as an aid to national education. Old things become new after a long time—such is this book.

●Kaishin Newspaper (August 11th) The "Tales of Japanese Castaways" written by Mr. Ishii Tamiji, editor-in-chief of Shōkokumin, describes the wandering and disasters of people who harbored grand plans to attempt trade and commerce in distant overseas lands, aiming to encourage the morale of children. It is an essential book for home education.

●Suntetsu (July 13th) Mr. Ishii Kendō, editor-in-chief of Shōkokumin, lamenting that the ancient spirit of our people's distant voyages has now faltered and failed, leaving them to hold their breath in vain on an isolated island, has compiled and authored the experiences of Japanese people of old who were accidentally cast adrift by waves and tasted countless hardships, publishing it to the world under the title "Tales of Japanese Castaways" with the purpose of reviving ancient nature and fostering the heroic ambition for distant expeditions and sea voyages. Now, while confined to a small island, rushing about with petty politics and stubbornly adhering to every law and regulation, this work has the feeling of slaying a great whale and breaking through drunken dreams. Regardless of its editorial format or literary style, we believe it to be a beneficial book for children's education.

What is contained in the book is limited to the Tokugawa period and includes the testimonies of castaways, customs of various islands, birds, beasts, plants, and trees. With beautiful illustrations by Mr. Kōgyō and lithographs by Mr. Yanagi Genkichi, it is nothing short of magnificent.

First: a person from Echizen drifted to Tartary and returned home via Ming China and Korea. Second: a person from Kii drifted to an uninhabited island and returned home thanks to a single plank. Third: a person from Owari drifted to Matan Island, deceived the natives, and returned home. Fifth: a person from Chikuzen drifted to Borneo, escaped from countless deaths, and returned home. These events are recorded in detail with illustrations. Once you open this book, amid the ghostly wailing, you also hear indescribable cheers of joy.

●Kokkai (July 16th) This book was compiled by Mr. Ishii Tamiji, chief journalist of Shōkokumin, to familiarize children raised in Japan, a maritime nation, with the business of navigation and serve as an aid to national education. It presents strange tales of castaways who voyaged overseas during the Tokugawa period, and in addition describes the customs and human feelings of various islands, and includes beautiful paintings. Therefore, it is not only suitable as a reader for children but will also be a beneficial book for people who wish to know about overseas conditions of that time.

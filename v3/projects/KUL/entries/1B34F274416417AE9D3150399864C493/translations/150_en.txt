Thus, after several days had passed, their firewood and water were exhausted. Their food supplies of rice were also running low. Though they had some leftover salted fish, they could not eat it because it made them thirsty, yet being reluctant to die, they could not bring themselves to fast completely. They removed bamboo pieces and ship planks to cook rice, sustaining their remaining lives with barely one bowl each, earnestly praying for rainwater from heaven. On the 23rd day of the 12th month, when it rained a little, they caught it in small boats, buckets, bowls and such, finally relieving their thirst. Day after day passed with nothing to do, and when the year changed, from mid-first month of the year of the Rooster the waves became somewhat calmer, but from mid-second month they again blew violently as before. Without even a shadow of land visible, they merely drifted on white waves, with no distinction between west and east, flowing only as the wind carried them.

Though their resentment was unbearable, since they were all too weak to move their limbs properly, they had no choice but to submit. These pirates working on the rough seas had neither mercy nor compassion - even hatred was more than sufficient for them.

On the morning of the 26th of the same month, when land was visible about half a ri away, there were more than twenty small fishing boats, and when they looked at the people aboard them, they all wore clothing similar to the previous pirates, so they thought this was not Japanese territory but probably Qing China. They pleaded for help through gestures, had those boats tow them, and dropped anchor in front of the coastal guard station.

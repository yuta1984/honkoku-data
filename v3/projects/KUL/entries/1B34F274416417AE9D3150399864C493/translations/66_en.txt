They could not sleep at night and forgot the passage of days in their grief and sorrow—their pitiable state was beyond description. Having already been separated by death from nine people and separated while living from four, only seven remained. Therefore, no matter where they might go, they promised to stay together, and they constantly asked the guards that if there were any ships with news from Japan, please let them know

As they stood on the beach, before long from behind them came people whose appearance was such that their heads were like spiral shells, they wore animal skins around their waists, carried bows and arrows in their hands or held guns, and others carried spears, naginata, and halberd-like weapons - about three hundred people in total, advancing toward them.

Though they did not speak these thoughts aloud, the twenty people all felt the same in their hearts and simply wept quietly.

Now from the evening of July 1st, most of the houses in the neighborhood lit large lanterns at their gates, and on the 13th day, they beautifully decorated their Buddhist altars, respectfully prepared dining utensils morning and evening, offered livestock such as pigs, sheep, and chickens, and held festivals for the spirits of the dead. On the night of the 15th, they constructed a segaki (hungry ghost) altar within the temple grounds, and from houses throughout the town, they cooked rice in portions of five to eight sho as they wished, filled large bowls with it, wrote the Buddhist names of each family's deceased on various colored papers, stuck these on bamboo skewers into the rice in the bowls, added sweets or various kinds of meat, and offered these on the aforementioned segaki altar. Many monks came out to chant sutras, and after the chanting ended, many young men from the city gathered to compete for the offered food. Everything they obtained was taken home to feed to the pigs, dogs, cats and other animals they kept at home. Moreover, that night, neighbors consulted together and floated large rafts on the great river in front, brought many candles of ten to twenty cho in length from their houses, lit fires all over the rafts, placed the dining utensils that had been offered before the Buddha among them, and then cut the ropes that had bound them.

People of high and low status, old and young, crowded the riverbank, some dancing, some singing, and the commotion was beyond description. Now at their ancestors' gravesites, from the evening of the 13th to the evening of the 20th, they visited daily to offer flowers, burn incense, and worship. One day there was a death among the relatives of the family where Magoshichi worked. Since that house was in a nearby neighborhood where they regularly visited each other day and night, that day Magoshichi, taking advantage of his master's orders, went to that house to help with various tasks, and carefully observed what kind of burial method it would be. The coffin was about six shaku long, two shaku five sun wide, about two shaku deep, made of boards about two sun thick, with gold leaf applied inside. On top of this they laid thick futon bedding and placed a pillow, dressed the corpse in four layers of clothing with an obi sash, hung a money pouch and tobacco case and all personal effects, laid the body face up, then covered it with gold leaf, and the lid had four nails.

They ate it raw. For Magoshichi, they grilled it before giving it to him, and also put liquor in flasks, giving him one every two days. The sailors each prepared their own liquor, packing many flasks in large boxes and taking them out to drink from time to time. Among these sailors, there were some who had come to Japan many times and had learned a little Japanese, which became very convenient for Magoshichi. This ship carried fifteen cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens and many other animals. These were all to be taken to Japan to graze on grass, then loaded back onto Dutch ships and returned, where they would fetch very high prices at market. Even on the ship, they once slaughtered a cow for cooking. To slaughter it, they fed it black sesame seeds for ten days beforehand, and on the day, they bound the cow's four legs, laid it on its side on the floor, and pierced through its chest with a blade. At that time the bleeding was profuse, so they placed a large basin underneath to catch the blood - about eight shō came out before it stopped. During this time, the cow's suffering was unbearable to watch. After the bleeding stopped, they cut off the head, skinned it, cut up the meat and distributed it to the crew.

This was said to be for the purpose of making a pact that from here the two ships would travel together toward Japan, helping each other during the voyage. While anchored in this harbor, Magoshichi requested to see the captains' quarters and entered their rooms. Their location was toward the stern, with suspended platforms installed. Therefore, even when the ship was tilted by rough winds, only the suspended platforms did not tilt at all. The decorations in the rooms were inlaid with gold and silver, but what most surprised the eye was a golden cloud dragon painted on the ceiling, which reflected the light of the waves and appeared as if alive. What was furnished in the room included clocks, carpenter's squares, telescope stands, etc., all executed with the utmost beauty. The room's width

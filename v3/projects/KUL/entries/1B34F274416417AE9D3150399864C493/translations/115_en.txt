between the toes. The geta (wooden clogs) are also no different. Waraji (straw sandals) are made from karamushi (ramie fiber), with the straps covering and wrapping around the toes like our country's waraji. Rice straw is not used for crafts; ropes and cables are made from rattan, yew, palm fiber, bamboo and such. Since large bamboo is especially abundant, temporary huts by the riverside are mostly built with bamboo pillars.

During our stay, I observed funeral ceremonies twice. A beautiful textile was placed over the sleeping coffin, which was mounted on a palanquin over six shaku long, surrounded by gold and silver ornaments and carvings. Sixteen or seventeen people carried this, while three or four other palanquins bore various decorative objects. Something like posthumous Buddhist names were written on textiles and placed on platforms, carried by five or six people.

Even for people of low status, the corpse is buried temporarily on the spot, and the formal funeral ceremony is conducted later.

One day, invited by a Chinese person, we went to see elephants kept about three ri from Hoi An in the countryside. There were five elephants and five young elephants, about one jō tall with gray hair, eating bamboo grass, straw, and grass. When spectators threw coins, the elephants would pick them up one by one with their trunks and hand them to the person riding on their backs. We also observed them wrapping up bamboo grass with their trunks, cutting it as cleanly and precisely as if cut with a sickle - quite remarkable to see. We also saw elephants with tower-like pack saddles on their backs, carrying three or four people to fetch water by the riverside. This

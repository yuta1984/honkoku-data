winds continued to blow, and at dawn on the twenty-ninth day we were blown against the aforementioned uninhabited island. The large ship was extremely damaged, and when we were blown against it, we struck the rocks forcefully, so at dawn on the twenty-ninth day the ship was wrecked.

There were three surviving people on that island. We met with these people and received their guidance. Following the instructions of these three people, we loaded the remaining rice and tools onto a small transport boat and immediately brought the boat up onto the island. We also had these three people board our small transport boat as passengers, departed from that island on the twenty-seventh day of the fourth month of the Year of the Sheep, and arrived at Hachijo Island on the first day of the fifth month. From there we were ordered to leave the country on an official ship, which we consider a most fortunate turn of events. We report on the severe winds that blew us off course and the circumstances of how these three people's lives were saved. Regarding other matters, there is no difference whatsoever from what these three people reported in detail. The above.

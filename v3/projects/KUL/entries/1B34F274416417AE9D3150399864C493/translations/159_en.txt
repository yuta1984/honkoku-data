They spread hides to lie on, and while traveling on horseback, when their hands and feet became so frozen they could not endure it, they would dismount briefly to warm themselves, then mount again and proceed. They finally arrived at Yakoutsk on November 9. The distance traveled was said to be 1,313 ri. This place is in the northeastern corner of Russia, where the cold is extremely severe. During their journey, when they spat from horseback, it would instantly freeze and fall with a rattling sound, giving an indication of the severity of the conditions.

Illustration of houses (earth dwellings) west of Odan
The house construction resembles earth dwellings, with the roof and all four sides thickly plastered with earth.

The double doorway prevents cold air from blowing in. Inside there are wooden floors or dirt floors, and the sleeping quarters have raised beds. For light, windows use ice as screens. This involves cutting thick ice from rivers into window shapes, fitting them into the windows, stuffing snow into the gaps, then pouring water over it so it immediately freezes solid. When snow blows against it from outside or debris accumulates, wiping it clean actually makes it brighter.

Five hundred ri north of this place is wasteland with no human habitation, and the northern seas 2,400 ri away are blocked by ice year-round, with no distinction between winter and summer.

During their stay in Yakoutsk, Kodayu received 35 pieces of silver, and Isokichi and the others each received 2,500 mon in copper coins from the magistrate. With foot soldiers as escorts, they departed on December 13. They rode on large sleds with box-like structures built on top, and in some places rode horses. On February 7 of the following year, Kansei 1 (Year of the Rooster), after traveling more than 2,480 ri, they arrived in Irkutsk.

During this journey they saw creatures called camels (berberuuda), beasts with very long necks and humps on their backs.

Also, geese remain in this country year-round, and especially from mid-spring to early autumn, they lay many eggs and hatch them. Individual households also keep them like ducks in our country, clipping their wings to raise them domestically, keeping four or five males with thirty to forty females, taking their eggs for food. There were also Koreans, Chinese, and others...

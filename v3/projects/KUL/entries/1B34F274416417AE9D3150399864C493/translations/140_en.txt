They barely managed to raise one anchor and hurried to take shelter behind the island, but on the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth days the wind grew even stronger with high waves, giving them no moment of peace. The mountainous island visible here was of unknown location, but it might be Qing territory.

If so, they recalled hearing that Ryukyu people fleeing to Satsuma would be problematic in relation to the Qing. Having two Ryukyu men among them who had been hired as sailors during their departure would be inconvenient. Therefore, they shaved the two men's topknots and transformed their appearance to that of mainland Japanese, changing Tosemura's name to Muraemon and Shimamori's to Moriuemon.

Soon they were given rice, sake, sweets, and other items, and were treated with great hospitality. This place had many houses and was the port of Dayuchang in Zhoushan, within Dinghai County of Ningbo Prefecture in Zhejiang Province. The nineteen men were now lodged in a shrine hall dedicated to the local earth god who served as the area's guardian deity. Though the dwelling was cramped and humble, it was far better than being on the raging waves.

Though the food was unfamiliar to their palates, it was more than sufficient to stave off hunger and thirst. As they spoke of feeling like they had escaped from a tiger's mouth to reach a loving mother, around midnight a local ba zong [a lower official under the military qianzong who guards the coastal areas] came and wrote characters to question them, but in detail...

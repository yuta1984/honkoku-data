Inquiry to the aforementioned seventeen people: Approximately how far do you think it is from the uninhabited island to Hachijojima?

1. Regarding the sea route from the aforementioned uninhabited island to Hachijojima, since we traveled by ship it is difficult to calculate, but as it took three days and three nights, we estimate that we covered approximately seven to eight hundred ri across the sea.

Also, afterward, the three men Jinpachi, Nisaburo, and Heisaburo, who had survived on the uninhabited island for over twenty years, were summoned. The husked rice that they had produced on the uninhabited island and brought here, which was deposited with the Hachijojima officials as mentioned previously, was to be presented to the government. Previously, when these men went to the town magistrate, they were accompanied by Yoda Yasuzaemon, a doshin from Hatchobori, and went to Fukiage.

1. Regarding the three men from Arai in Enshu Province, who had suffered hardships on the uninhabited island for many years, [the authorities] took pity on them and granted each person a three-person stipend, totaling nine-person stipends for the three men, to be given for their entire lifetimes, so that they could stop working for their livelihood and live comfortably for the rest of their lives. They returned to their native Enshu Province, and one of them remained alive until recently. People from nearby areas in Enshu would meet with him regularly, and he would tell stories of the uninhabited island and relate how, after returning to Japan, the government showed them various acts of mercy, saying it was truly a blessed era.

There were very many people who looked after them favorably, and especially a family of father and son living near the harbor showed particular sincerity in lending assistance. One day when they all went to express gratitude for this kindness, they were treated to various hospitalities and were taken around the neighborhood where rice was begged and given to them. This was no different from helping old acquaintances in need, so they all came to regard it as their own lodging and visited morning and evening.

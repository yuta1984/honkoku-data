Thinking this was a divine revelation from the gods of our divine nation, all twenty men jumped into the water at the rocky shore to purify themselves, and with sincere devotion faced eastward, voicing their wishes in unison, then boarded the boat and threw the purification strips into the sea. Though we could not tell whether the tide was rising or falling, the purification strips flowed toward what seemed to be the northeast direction. This was the gods' guidance. Rejoicing that they were going in the direction of favorable winds, everyone raised the sail, and being a small boat, it felt like we were racing faster than an arrow. Though we all looked toward the horizon hoping to see islands, nothing was visible - we could only see the vast expanse of ocean stretching endlessly. As the day grew dark, everyone said, "This is the night of the 27th. In this darkness we cannot see the ocean surface, nor can we determine direction. We feel so forlorn.

We saw no people, and the size of the island was roughly fifty to sixty ken square when measured in ken. On this island there were no trees at all, and for grass, only thick reed-like grass grew near the waterside. The upper part of the island was mostly rock, with some soil between the rocks where plants resembling hachijo grass or udo leaves from our region grew in various places. Nothing else was visible. We then returned to where we had moored the boat, all boarded the vessel, collected some hollowed-out round rocks from the island, and since we had already finished eating the food we had cooked on the original island yesterday, we gathered some dry grass from this island

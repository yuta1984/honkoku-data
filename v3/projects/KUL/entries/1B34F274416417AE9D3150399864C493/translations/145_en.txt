They arrived. This place was within Pinghu County of Jiaxing Prefecture in Zhejiang Province, namely the place where ships crossing to Japan and Nagasaki port gather. The following day, the 28th, everyone went ashore and entered the house of a very wealthy man named Xie Yongtai. This Mr. Xie was a trading house of the Fan family's twelve houses that conducted commerce with Japan, handling both imports and exports of goods at this house. This time, by order of the officials, the expenses for meals during their stay and other miscellaneous costs were all borne by this house. Their treatment was extremely kind in all matters, so much so that everyone almost forgot they were in a foreign land.

When the new year dawned (Year of the Ox), on New Year's Day, the interpreter informed them that they should pay New Year's courtesy visits to the officials of Zhapu, but since Nakahara was unwell, only Ikeyama, accompanied by one servant and three sailors, made courtesy calls to eight official offices in the company of Liu Zemu.

Before this, sailor Genshiro had contracted typhoid fever, and despite various treatments, they proved ineffective, and he died on the morning of September 15th of the previous Snake Year. At that time, there was nothing that could be done aboard the ship, so they placed him in a chest, but when they arrived at port and requested burial, they were told he should be moved to a proper coffin for the funeral. Though they declined, saying it need not go that far, the Chinese would not listen and four or five Chinese people buried him very kindly. At this time, they left it to what the Chinese said, and four people from their side also went out to see him off, but that Genshiro alone was buried in Chinese soil was truly a fleeting matter. However, servant Gonuemon also contracted dysentery around the 10th day of the first month of the Ox year, and despite medication, it proved ineffective, and he died on the 13th of the same month.

came to their senses, lowered a small boat, and landed seeking water. When they observed the condition of the land, there were no inhabitants at all, and the only things obstructing their view were mountains thick with trees.

When one person spoke, all the crew members shared the same sentiment and agreed it was reasonable. Then they told the three men that they would give them rice if they would show them where the ginseng grew, and they

Ah, now the situation across the five continents of the world is dark and turbulent, with raging waves threatening to sweep away mountains and carry off boulders. In the midst of this, who shall be tasked with commanding the sea gods, manning the sails of national defense, and wielding the oars of industrial development to guide our Great Empire of Japan safely to the shore of wealth and strength?

May of Meiji 25 (1892), at a humble dwelling at the foot of the plateau

Preface

1. This book has been compiled with the purpose of educating children about maritime affairs and serving as an aid to national education.

1. The book limits its scope to the Tokugawa period because records from earlier times are extremely scarce and there is little material available for reference.

1. Each account is based on the testimonies of castaways and contemporary miscellaneous records compiled from interviews with these castaways.

1. What the castaways relate cannot be said to be without error when viewed from today's perspective. Since I plan to include illustrations and provide scholarly examination of the place names where they were cast ashore, as well as customs, birds and beasts, plants and trees, etc., in the final volume, I do not correct each instance individually.

1. The writing principally aims to directly record facts and deliberately avoids the use of speculative language.

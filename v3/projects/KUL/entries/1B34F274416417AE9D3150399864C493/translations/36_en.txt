In this ship were visible arrows, short bows, muskets and such, and the people aboard appeared formidable in the manner of samurai and magistrates in Japan, all wearing swords. Particularly one who appeared to be their commander had his hair bound in a topknot and had an especially fierce appearance. Among them was one who understood Japanese, who asked, "From what country to where does this ship travel?" When they answered, "We are people of Great Japan who encountered a storm three years ago and drifted away, and have finally built a ship to return," he became suspicious again, saying "This ship cannot be a Japanese vessel, and especially the materials are not Japanese products," reproaching them. So as mentioned before, they explained that this ship was built with timber received from Batan Island, constructed by their own hands. He then recognized their hardships and showed special compassion, saying "First you should eat this," and gave them about five sho of rice.

Being shown such deep neighborly affection, they felt nothing but gratitude, thinking that in countries that revere the majesty of Japan, people would act in such a way, and feeling the boundless imperial benevolence, they already felt as if they had returned to Japan. Regarding this, even if they were barbarians at the ends of China and India who still knew nothing of Japan, when they thought back on how the natives of Batan Island had been cruel and heartless, it would be foolish to hold resentment even now.

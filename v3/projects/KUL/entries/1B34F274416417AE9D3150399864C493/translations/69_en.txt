arrived. At New Year's, this land too had its decorations for the year. They mixed sweet potato with glutinous rice, added brown sugar and pounded it together, flattened it and cut it into squares to make decorative rice cakes for the beginning of the year. Now spring had only just begun, but the climate was warm, so like our country in the third month, flowers of various colors bloomed in profusion. However, no flowers that seemed to be cherry blossoms could be seen at all. The plum blossom charm of Tenman Tenjin, whom they always worshipped, had been taken away on the first island they reached, but here they saw plum blossoms for the first time. They picked some and inserted them between the rocks in the garden, chanting the sacred name of the deity of distant Dazaifu in Chikuzen and worshipping. As things went on, spring reached early February, and again a ship was prepared. The two of them were loaded aboard with two women of marriageable age, and together with eleven sailors and helmsmen, they rowed around the harbors and set sail heading south. After traveling a sea route of approximately three hundred ri, they went ashore and walked for about a day, entering a country called Irinkatto.

On their backs and chests they had painted imposing designs of cloud dragons or lions and tigers, and had carved arabesque patterns into their arms and shoulders. The women's ears also had rings linked by chains in long sequences, hanging like Buddhist rosary ornaments. They wore coarse cloth on their bodies, but exposed their arms from the elbows down and also exposed their chests. They bound up their curly hair and used picked flowers from plants and trees as hairpins. Now, when parents died in this country, they would cut off the head and keep it, then cut off another person's head and attach it to the corpse for burial. If this wasn't done, it was said to bring great curses. Wealthy people would buy someone whose head could be used for this purpose while still alive, while poor people would receive criminals or work abroad to prepare for after death. Until now they had wandered through various barbarian countries and suffered hardships, but having entrusted their lives to heaven, they were robust in body and spirit and not particularly surprised by anything.

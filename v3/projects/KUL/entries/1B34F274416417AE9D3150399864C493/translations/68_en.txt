While waiting day after day thinking "today or tomorrow," the months gradually passed by, and it was already mid-June. One day, four sailors came rowing a small boat, saying they would take the two of them aboard. Not knowing their destination but having no choice, they boarded the vessel as instructed. They immediately set sail, and after about ten days had passed, they arrived at a small port and disembarked. This land was called Uroku. The sailors placed the two men in a rough hut by the shore, forbidding them to go outside and even prohibiting visitors from coming and going.

Afterward, they were carried in palanquins to various villages and towns, continuing to be exhibited as before. During this time, they were always served delicious food and occasionally given distilled liquor to drink. In this land, the method for making distilled liquor was to cook rice, put it in jars, soak it in brown sugar water, let it foam, then put it in a pot with a steamer and distill it. Thus that year too came to an end, and with only two souls between heaven and earth, a lonely spring

As night gradually deepened, they picked up stones to use as pillows and tied grass together to serve as bedding.
While chanting the names of Buddha and such, they all lay down together, but the sound of waves broke their dreams and they could not sleep well.
Worrying and fretting about various things—what had happened before and what might happen in the future—when they thought it was already past the fourth hour of the night
(10 PM in modern time), torches blazed abundantly and people appeared to be
approaching. They thought these must surely be coming to kill them, but like fish caught in a net,
they could not escape even if they tried, so their fear was boundless, their souls seemed to
leave their bodies, and they lay trembling in terror. Soon, illuminated by the approaching torches,
dozens of people of strange appearance, carrying guns and holding spears, surrounded the place where they were sleeping, some thrusting spears at their shoulders,
others stabbing at their sides and arms, but their bodies sustained no wounds
at all, which seemed to be because the spears were still in their sheaths, and this gave their hearts some relief. However,
these were evil fellows, so they wanted to resist, but what could they do? Having gone without food for a long time
and with no water to moisten their throats, both body and mind were exhausted and even standing was not easy.

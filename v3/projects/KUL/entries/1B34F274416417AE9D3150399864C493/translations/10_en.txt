All means of survival were exhausted, and what further misfortunes they might encounter in the future was impossible to predict. Though they had long been prepared for the dangerous undertaking of crossing the precarious floating bridge of a drifting boat, how could mere mortals have foreseen falling into such a wretched state? Their mutual lamenting of their ill fortune at this late hour was so pitiful that calling it "sorrowful" seemed inadequate.

Afterward, the fifteen men were all taken to various villages and sometimes ordered to do tasks like weeding fields. All of them thought: how could they willingly submit to being used as laborers by barbarians no better than beasts? However, since refusing work would bring the suffering of whippings, they secretly conspired together to leave the weeds in the fields while pulling up all the grain crops. After this, they were no longer ordered to weed and passed their days, but one day, an official-looking person came from a place said to be about five days' journey away, examined the castaways, conducted some kind of investigation, and returned. About twenty days later, the same ten men who had come before came again, selected three people from among the village residents, and took them along with the fifteen castaways, mounting them all on horses and leading them away to an unknown destination.

As they traveled, observing the condition of the land, they saw no rice paddies at all, only dry fields along the way where various grains like millet and barnyard grass were planted. In the mountains, there were some trees they had seen in Japan and others they had not, with five-needle pines being particularly abundant. As they continued their journey, for about five days' travel there were traces of human traffic, but beyond that point there were no proper roads, and they had to push through grass across vast plains. Since there were no human settlements in the area, they were given food supplies carried by the horses, and each night they used grass as pillows while dreaming of their homeland. After traveling for thirty-three days, they finally found a single road with farmhouses visible nearby, and on the thirty-fifth day, they arrived at a very large city. They later learned that this was the capital of Tartary.

Upon entering the capital, they were immediately taken to what appeared to be a magistrate's office. The people gathered around seemed to be wondering what manner of persons had arrived, viewing them with suspicion.

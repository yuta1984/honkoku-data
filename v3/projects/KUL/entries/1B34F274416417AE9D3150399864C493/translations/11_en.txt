Now, when they entered a place resembling a courtroom, numerous officials had arranged themselves with dignity on an elevated platform. First, those three men were summoned, and various interrogations took place, but since the castaways could not understand the language, they had no idea what was being asked or answered. After a while, the officials turned toward the castaways and began making various gestures and mimicking motions to question them. Seeing this, it appeared they believed the Japanese had come to steal and had been killed for it. The castaways could not bear this indignation and used various hand gestures to show that they were not thieves at all, but people who had been cast adrift by a great storm. This seemed to be well understood, and the officials also indicated through gestures that this indeed seemed to be the case. With this, the interrogation proceedings appeared to conclude, and after the officials conferred amongst themselves for a while, they brought out the three men, stripped them naked, made them lie face down, and using very thick and sturdy bamboo whips, struck each of their buttocks and backs fifty times so severely that their flesh tore and blood flowed, their cries and screams were clamorous, and the miserable spectacle was almost unbearable to see and hear.

The castle had cruder construction than the castles of daimyo in our country, with turrets at the corners. Below the castle, mansion-style townhouses stood closely packed together, but the appearance of these houses was like that of temples in our country—very large constructions with round pillars and roof tiles treated with glaze and colored mostly in five colors. The streets and roads were not particularly splendid, but could be called fairly clean. Also, the interiors of all the houses were paved with cut stone, with no wooden flooring at all.

The name of the Tartar king was Chau-ten, and he was eight years old at that time. Also, Kiu-an-su, Ha-to-ron-su, Shii-men-su, Hou-sen-su and others were the names of ministers, as I learned later.

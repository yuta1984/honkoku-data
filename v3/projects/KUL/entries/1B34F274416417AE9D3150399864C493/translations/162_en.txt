The imperial favor was most grateful and overwhelming, but we subjects still have an emperor in our homeland. To easily bend our principles and become subjects of a foreign country is something our national customs do not permit.
Moreover, the affection for our elderly mothers, wives, children, and brothers cannot be severed, and in everything from food to language, there are many things that do not suit our preferences. As an even greater act of benevolence, we humbly request the favor of swift return to our homeland.

Gradually his illness was cured, and they reached the point of submitting their petition to return home. On the 9th day of the 10th month of the same year, there was a summons from the king, and they appeared at the palace. Numerous officials lined the seats, and palace ladies stood like clouds to the left and right of the throne, so it was embarrassing and they hesitated, but one...

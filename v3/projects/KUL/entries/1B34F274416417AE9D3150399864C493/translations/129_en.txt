Inquiry: Regarding clothing - how did the three men manage to procure clothing during the twenty-one years?

One: Regarding the procurement of clothing, apart from what we were wearing when we drifted to the island, we had no spare clothes. From time to time we used cotton sails from abandoned or wrecked ships that drifted ashore, as well as clothing from those who had gradually died, but since this was insufficient for so many years, we dried the skins of the large birds we ate for food together with their feathers. After using them as bedding for a while, the skins naturally became soft, so we patched them together and wore them to get by. Of course, even during what seemed like winter it was warm, and we could get by with just one tattered garment. Summer was also exceptionally cool, and overall the heat and cold were more bearable than in your lands.

Inquiry: Regarding wind, rain, snow, and hail during your stay on the island, as well as thunder and earthquakes.

One: During our stay on the island, snow did not fall, but rain fell frequently and heavily. In winter,

there were occasionally freezing rain and hail. Thunder rumbled from time to time. Perhaps because the waves were always tremendous, during the twenty years we were there, it shook once as if it were quite a significant earthquake. I do not remember when that was. Wind blew daily. What seemed like great storms occurred occasionally. Sometimes the waves were calm.

Inquiry: Since this is an island in the remote southern seas, were there any unusual things, or changes in the appearance of the sun, moon, and starry sky?

One: Though this is an island in the remote southern seas, there was nothing unusual among what existed on the island. Generally, the appearance of the sky and the movement of the sun, moon, and stars were no different from what one observes in your lands. However, during what seemed like summer, sometimes at night, perhaps because large fish gathered, the water on the sea surface would shine extraordinarily brightly. That light would sometimes extend up to the sky.

thoughts of them made him weep with emotion, but since he could not remain in that state, he soon changed his clothes and hired a palanquin to hurry to his home province. On the evening of the same twenty-sixth day, he safely arrived at his own house in Karatomari Bay.

However, his elder brother was at home alone, and upon seeing Magoshichi's face, he was both surprised and delighted. For a while he could not speak and just sat there dazed, but recognizing his unmistakable true younger brother, he later came close and took his hand, asking "How did you return here now? In what distant country have you spent these months and years? Why did you not send even one message during all these long years?" They spent time in stories of the past. Magoshichi approached the Buddhist altar, first prostrated himself before his parents' memorial tablets, then raised his head to look over the other tablets. Among the many, he found one inscribed "Seinyū Shinji" suspicious, so he took it and looked at the back, which read "Lay name: Magoshichi, aged 17 years, died on the 6th day of the 10th month of Hōreki 12, year of the Water Horse" - the very day of his departure had been made his death day, and he had been counted among the dead.

Seeing this, Magoshichi rejoiced that his fate had been so strong, but also remembering the people who had truly become deceased in that foreign land, he was moved to shed secret tears. That night he talked through until dawn with his brother, and when he inquired about what had happened to those nineteen people afterward, everything had completely changed - some had lost their aged parents, some had lost their young children, some wives had grown weary of waiting for their husbands' return and taken other husbands, some had remarried into other families with their young children. Hardly anything remained as it had been in the past, so the ancient tale of Urashima Tarō came to mind anew, and he lamented the transience of this sorrowful world. In any case, what was truly fortunate was the circumstances of the present-day Urashima, Magoshichi. That I have continued writing such an account with my poor brush is because it gives me an increasingly inspiring feeling, and like the long roots of sedge grass, I do not tire of the length and write thus.

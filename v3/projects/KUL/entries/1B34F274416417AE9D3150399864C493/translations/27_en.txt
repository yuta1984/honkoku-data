It was impossible to know, so they needed to prepare their rice rations properly. From then on, the fifteen men decided to eat only two sho of rice per day total. This meant each person's portion was only slightly more than one go, but since their strength had declined and their bodies had weakened, they did not feel such severe hunger. However, looking at their remaining rice, it seemed they could not continue eating even this amount for very long. So they all consulted together, wondering if there might be something else, and unpacked their cargo to look.

The people who came out from within the island were all unfamiliar-looking individuals - their hair was short and curly, they wore no clothing on their bodies, their skin color was extremely black, their eyes were bright and their noses flat, altogether seeming hardly like people of this world. They thought it very strange that in this vast world there could be such exotic-looking people. They called out from their boat, asking what country this island belonged to and what place it was called, but their words were completely incomprehensible and they could not communicate, so they had no choice but to return to the main ship. While they were doing this, from the island

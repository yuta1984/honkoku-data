The eleven men mentioned above were sent back on Chinese ships (second and third vessels) in Kansei 2, Kanoe-inu year (1790) [《marginal note: 102 years ago from now》] and returned to our Nagasaki. When did they set sail? Where did they drift?

They first set sail in the seventh month of Tenmei 8 [《marginal note: 104 years ago from now》]. From what is now Hokkaido, at Matsumae, a man named Edagasaki Hikoroku owned a large ship called Shōeimaru with 22-tan sails and 700-koku capacity. They loaded his merchandise: 50 barrels of sake, 200 bales of rice (4 to per bale), 10 containers of tobacco (100 kin each), 50 tan of cotton cloth, 30 pieces of used clothing, 350 bales of koji, and other goods. With ship captain Zenkichi, one helmsman, and sailors totaling 12 people aboard, they departed Matsumae port on the 20th of the same month. After nine days they reached Ishikari, unloaded their merchandise, traded for 1,640 bundles and 29 pieces of salted salmon of various sizes, loaded these aboard, left Ishikari on October 4th, returned to Matsumae port on the 21st, reported to the local agent Daikokuya Moemon for inspection, and planned to immediately transport the goods to Kobayashi Sōkurō in Zaimokuchō 3-chōme, Edo. While waiting for favorable weather, they loaded 433 salted yellowtail and other provisions,

40 bales of rice rations, salt, miso, firewood, etc., hired three additional sailors, and with 15 people aboard, raised sail in the morning wind of November 4th and sailed toward Edo.

Once out at sea, there was nothing to rely on but the wind. With wind, the ship advances; without wind, it does not. The ship was heavy and the power of oars was slight. If contrary winds arose and the tidal currents were not favorable, no matter how much effort was exerted, the ship would not obey - this needs no explanation to those who have taken up oars. The courage of mariners of that time was truly praiseworthy. On the morning of the 8th day after departure, they had advanced to the waters off Hachinohe in Nambu domain, when suddenly a great wind blew up from the west-northwest direction. Though all aboard worked frantically, there was no time to lower the sails before they were torn apart, and even the stern was broken. The entire ship appeared to be in danger, so they began throwing cargo overboard one after another, lowered four anchor lines to try to hold position, and dropped anchor, but the ship drifted so rapidly that the anchor rope soon chafed through, and they were blown out into the great ocean with no idea of their location. Therefore, they tried to carefully consider their bearing and sail back to their original region...

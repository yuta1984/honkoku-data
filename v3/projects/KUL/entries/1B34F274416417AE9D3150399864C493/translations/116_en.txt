The keeper assigned to this elephant stable does not appear to be someone dispatched by the government.

Prior to this, from the end of the fifth month, Zen'uemon suffered from dysentery, and though many doctors administered various medicines and treatments, no beneficial effects were seen at all. From around the fifteenth day of the seventh month, he gradually became critically ill, and on the twenty-fourth of the same month, he died at the age of forty-four.

Among them, Tontaikun-shi appeared to be a wealthy merchant, about sixty years old, with high dignity. Later, when this person went to Hoihon-koku, the residence of the Annam king, we saw him riding in a beautiful palanquin provided as hospitality by the king, traveling with fourteen or fifteen attendants, confirming that he was certainly not a person of low status.

The seven of us thought it best to first seek his compassion, so we entrusted him with Saheita's money of three ryō and two bu. In return, we were blessed with fourteen cotton single-layer garments, fourteen setta sandals, and nine kan-mon of coins for tobacco expenses. These single-layer garments were made by taking our old clothes and having new ones tailored in their style.

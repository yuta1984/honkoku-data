Though the king was still young and weak, the prime minister must have been a person of wisdom and ability. The legal system was exceptionally strict and clear, both high and low were compassionate, honest and without deception, and even if gold and silver were scattered about, no one would steal them - they were truly courteous in manner. Only in the remote place where the castaways had been killed were the laws not properly enforced, and it was clear from the interrogation that even the officials were extremely angry about this.

The physical build of the Tartars was larger than that of Japanese people. They shaved their heads, leaving about one square inch of hair in a circle on top, which they grew long, braided into three strands and let hang down. They left their mustaches as they were, and both high and low alike shaved their chin beards. Women parted their hair in the middle into two sections, wound it around front and back like a headband. Both noble and common wore garments with very narrow sleeves that were long enough to cover the backs of their hands, with wide hems spreading from the sides, and wore round-brimmed hats. Generally they ate millet as their staple food, and when dining, they placed food, soup, and vegetables in bowls on high tables, each person eating with both spoons and chopsticks.

Both noble and common wore at their waists something like a large wakizashi, about one shaku five or six sun to two shaku in length. These were mostly made with sharkskin, shaped with tapered points and flared pommels, fitted with guards, and when needed, could be used to cut wood and bamboo. Among weapons, the bow was primary, about four shaku in length. Their skill was extremely accomplished - they rarely missed targets at ten or twenty ken distance. They would gallop their horses and shoot freely in all directions from horseback. Their horsemanship was also astonishing - when they showed their whips, the horses would charge straight ahead, and they sat very steadily in their saddles. When they wanted to stop, they merely released the reins and the horses would halt immediately, never veering to the side. Their armor was like Japanese scale mail, made of iron scales sewn together without gaps.

One day there was a summons from the magistrate's office, so wondering what it could be about, they all went fearfully, but contrary to expectations, fifteen beautiful saddled horses had been prepared for them to ride, with officials coming out to escort them in groups of two or three, and they departed toward Beijing in Ming China.

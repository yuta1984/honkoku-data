During this time, they unloaded the stored rice that was to be delivered to Oshima, and on the twenty-first day they departed from the same place. However, on the twenty-third day, southeast winds arose again, and on the following twenty-fourth day, there were strong winds and heavy rain. The entire sky was like a dark night, making it difficult to determine direction clearly, and their situation appeared extremely perilous. They hastily cut away the mast and other parts, but the rudder broke and the oars were smashed, leaving them helpless and at the mercy of the currents. On the twenty-fifth day, the wind calmed slightly, so they gathered ship planks to make a temporary rudder, used a damaged beam as a mast, reduced the sail to eight tan in size, and sailed through the night following the north-northeast wind. After that, the wind changed daily, they completely lost their bearings, and not knowing which part of the ocean they were in, they drifted for several days. By this time, their drinking water was completely exhausted, and they could only boil seawater to obtain a little water and cook rice to stave off hunger.

However, on the fifth day of the eighth month, there were strong northeast winds, and on the following sixth day, heavy rain was added to their troubles. Though they felt they might be blown away, they did not give in and collected rainwater in every available container - water buckets, small boats, rice bowls, and anything else they could find. Thus they drifted emptily on the ocean for several days.

They continued drifting, but from the nineteenth to the twenty-third of the same month, east-northeast winds carried them west-northwest, and on the following twenty-fourth day the wind changed to north. Around past noon, they first spotted some small islands faintly to the west, and everyone clapped their hands in joy. The next day they were fortunate to be blown toward them by strong winds, but upon closer inspection, all six islands turned out to be uninhabited.

Muttering that their joy had been in vain, they headed toward a considerably large island visible to the west. They entered the island's shelter at night and dropped anchor, but the seawater was red and murky, the tidal current was swift, the waves rough, and the wind and rain fierce. Particularly since it was the middle of the night when nothing could be distinguished, their difficulties were beyond description. On the morning of the twenty-sixth day at the hour of five [8 AM today], the ship drifted close to shore, and fearing that being blown against it would cause a shipwreck - a major disaster - they dropped two anchors, but could not stop. As they were gradually blown toward land, they had no time to raise the anchors and had to cut away one of them.

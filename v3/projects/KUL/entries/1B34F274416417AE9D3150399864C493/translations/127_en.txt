What appears to be climbing onto the stone that looks like this should be sea lions (ashika). Besides that, there are beasts with the fur color of river otters that appear larger than cattle, which we occasionally see climbing onto the aforementioned rocks. What kind of beasts are they? I do not know their names. Moreover, since we observe them from quite a distance across the sea, we cannot clearly discern their shape. Only their fur color is clearly visible when they come out during the daytime like river otters. Of course, when the tide is high or when there are waves, they cannot be seen. There also appear to be five or six other rock-like formations in the vicinity. It is rare for the waves to be calm on ordinary days. Also at night, in areas about twenty or thirty ken below the rock cave toward the shore where miscanthus reeds and such grow thickly, even when there is no wind, there are noisy sounds as if ten people were running about. We think it must be the beasts that appeared on the rocks running around. Overall, we have never seen any beast forms, not even mice, within the island. Since there are frequent rains and winds, we use planks from the shipwreck

　　Another inquiry: Regarding the flint, sickle, and tinder you possessed when you were blown adrift - after staying there for over twenty years, these should have become unusable, yet how do you obtain fire for your constant cooking and heating?

One: When we were blown adrift to that island, we each possessed fire-striking sickles and stones. Indeed, they were useful for two or three years. The tinder was exhausted during that time. There is grass like chigaya (cogon grass) on that island. We burn that and use it

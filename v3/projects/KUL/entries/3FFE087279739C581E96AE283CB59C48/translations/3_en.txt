A bamboo screen was hung at the front of the observation pavilion, and seating was arranged so that [the Shogun] could observe through it. On the right side in the inner area, Matsudaira Etchū-no-kami and Kanō Tōtōmi-no-kami were in attendance.

[This document is a record in question-and-answer format of the interrogation conducted by the shogunate on the 18th day of the 9th month of Kansei 5 (1793) of the drifting people Daikokuya Kōtayū and Isokichi, who were returned when the Russian Laxman came to Nemuro seeking trade in Kansei 4 (1792). Russia was seeking Japan's opening 60 years before America's Perry. At this time, the shogunate gave him a letter saying they would respond in Nagasaki. Following that letter, Rezanov came to Nagasaki in Bunka 1 (1804), but the shogunate refused trade.]

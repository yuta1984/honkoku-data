I saw them on the road from Yakutsk to Irkutsk. They were generally mouse-colored, extraordinarily large, and had humps on their backs. Their heads were very elongated and small. They call them "verblud" (camels).

Question:
Is tobacco the same as here (in Japan)? What do they call it? Are pipes made of ceramic or metal?

Answer:
It is of lower quality than ours (in Japan). They still call it "tobacco." There are ceramic pipes as well. There are also metal and stone ones. They use flint made from crystal to light it and smoke with that. We found it too precious, so we did not smoke using the flint. When asked why, we explained that it seemed too precious, and they laughed.

Question:
Do they practice martial arts?

Answer:
I did not see anything of that sort at all. I observed people of ashigaru (foot soldier) status practicing with firearms. They were primarily learning how to position their feet. I did not see bows of the type that samurai carry. I saw hunters carrying them. They were very crude things, just like the bows of the Ainu people. The bladed weapons are very dull and do not cut at all. The metalwork appears to have been roughly sharpened with coarse whetstones to a white finish.

Question:

Question
Have you seen those things made in the shape of a cross? 《marginal note: These are Christian ritual implements》

Answer
These are hung at the entrances of houses and worn around people's necks. The name is "Christ." However, they are not in the shape of a cross. They are flared at the bottom with three horizontal bars inserted. Whenever visiting someone's house, one first pays respects at the Buddhist altar upon arrival, and only then greets the master of the house. When leaving, even if one does not take formal leave of the master, it is sufficient to pay respects at the Buddhist altar. They call Buddha "Hoshifu." "Hoshifu" means "above," which refers to heaven, as I have been told.

It splits in two from those lines, like splitting bamboo. They then place it inside a furnace sealed with clay on three sides...

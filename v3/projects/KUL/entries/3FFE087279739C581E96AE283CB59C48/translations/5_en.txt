　　　　Question
Where was the place you first made landfall?

　　　　Answer
We drifted ashore at the Aleutian Islands. During the four years we stayed in this place, our food consisted of salt-steamed fish and something made by boiling and grinding black lily roots in water until it became like white wine. The women had two horns on their chin and two on their nose, with blue tattoo lines on their faces and the backs of their hands.
These horns were not naturally grown but were made from whale tusks, carved to about the thickness of a writing brush shaft, two to three inches long, fashioned like hairpins. They normally used them as hairpins.
Both men and women wore bird feathers and lived in pit dwellings. From there we went to a land called Kamchatka.

During our stay, six of our crew members died. Their symptoms were of a disease we had never seen in Japan, called scurvy 《called "sigeulboik" in Dutch, which is scurvy》. In this land we encountered a Russian captain 《this is an official title that also exists among Western nations》 named Demokhnashkhoine, who took us to a place called Okhotsk. From there we stayed for four years in a place called Irkutsk. This place had particularly severe cold, and during winter, when going outside, we had to wear fur coats and wrap our faces in fox fur, walking with only our eyes exposed. If we exposed even slightly our ears or nose through gaps in the covering, they would freeze solid, and when we entered a house and received warmth, they would immediately thaw and fall off. Areas like the cheek tips would drop off as if gouged out. When this happened, applying butter mixed with clove and cinnamon powder would heal it. When subjected to severe cold, hands and feet could also fall off.

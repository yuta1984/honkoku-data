Question:
Did you observe that there is a statue of Peter (the Great), the emperor who restored Russia, above the castle gate?

Answer:
The statue of Peter (the Great) is enshrined in a mausoleum. In the treasury, there is a large magnet about three feet in size, square-shaped, reinforced with metal bars and suspended. At its four corners, anchors weighing one hundred kan each are attached by magnetic attraction. When you turn a screw mechanism set up beside the magnet, the magnetic contact points shift, causing the four anchors to fall to the ground. When you turn the screw back again, those anchors fly up and stick back as before.

When lying face up and extending my hand into the muzzle, my fingertips barely touched the sides. The length appeared to be about three ken. In the same location, there is a large bell. It is said to have fallen due to fire, and the bell is embedded in the ground. They have dug around it and built stone walls, so that one can go down inside to view it. Its enormity is beyond description. Its weight is said to be 2,500 kan, calculated using the Japanese measure where 4 kan and 500 me equals 1 kan. It looked like a small mountain.

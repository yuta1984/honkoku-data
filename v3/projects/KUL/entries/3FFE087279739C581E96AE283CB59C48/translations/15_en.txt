Have you encountered anything particularly frightening?

Are geese present year-round?

Answer
They are generally present year-round. Among them, from spring until early autumn, they lay and hatch eggs in particularly large numbers. Households also pluck their feathers and raise them like ducks, taking their eggs for food. They keep four or five males with thirty or forty females each. The taste of the eggs is very good.

Question
I heard there is a large stone bridge in Moscow. Did you see it?

This is a sticky substance similar in nature to glue, which dissolves in water but not in alcohol. There is also about twenty-four to twenty-five parts of a substance with properties like egg white, which also dissolves in water. Therefore, by boiling in water, these two types can be removed. In addition, there is about one to one and a half parts of oily and fatty matter, and yellow silk carries a small amount of additional yellow fatty substance. These do not dissolve in water and can only be washed away with alcohol or soap solution. Using a chemical called chlorine will clean it most rapidly. Using sulfurous acid will clean the surface but cannot sufficiently remove the impurities. Therefore, to bleach silk, one uses either chlorine, soap, or potash.

The methods of bleaching and dyeing silk mentioned above are extensive topics, so they will be translated and published at another time.

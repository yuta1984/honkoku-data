While it is truly inconvenient for a Japanese person to wear foreign clothing, once aboard ship one should definitely change to Western dress. This is not from a preference for novelty, but purely for convenience. In Japanese style, one cannot walk on deck wearing straw sandals during wind and rain, and when the ship rolls and one occasionally becomes seasick or even slightly ill, one naturally cannot bathe or groom oneself cleanly, the skin becomes dirty with grime, and unsightly parts of the body are sometimes exposed through the sleeves or around the hem, making for a most unseemly appearance.

For changes of clothing, first prepare the usual Western clothes in three to four sets, undergarments in thirty to forty pieces, summer clothes in four to five sets, and nightwear in three to four sets (summer clothes should be made of white or gray linen or gauze).

On British or French ships, for about one month the climate is like that of our June or July. On American ships, the extremely hot areas last only about ten days. After boarding, one should first discreetly give a tip of three to five dollars to the person called a steward, who handles the catering. Due to this, the service for sleeping, waking, and meals during the voyage will be greatly different.

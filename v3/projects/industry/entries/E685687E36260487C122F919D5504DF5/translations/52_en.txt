it should be possible to sell them.

In this manner, once more than half of the goods brought over have been sold, it is best policy to make a clearance decision on the remaining items and quickly sell them off and withdraw, even at slightly reduced prices. When things drag on, expenses also mount considerably, and the season gradually becomes later, so one should make efforts to sell everything within thirty days at most. As time progressively passes, even if the prices fall, they will never necessarily rise again.

Also, if one intends to sell large quantities all at once, one should employ a selling method called "public auction" (competitive selling). This method involves first renting a magazine (store), arranging the silkworm egg cards, and placing a newspaper advertisement stating "Japanese finest quality silkworm egg cards, so many tens of thousands of sheets, Japanese merchant so-and-so, at store number so-and-so on such-and-such street, will have a great sale from such-and-such date to such-and-such date for so many days." If this is done, even one or two million sheets of goods can be sold out immediately. The usual auction requires only about five percent for commission fees, transportation taxes, and other charges combined.

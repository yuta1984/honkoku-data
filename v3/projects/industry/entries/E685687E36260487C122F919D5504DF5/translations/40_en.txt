It is also acceptable to send by American ship. If it is an American ship, it should depart from Yokohama via various ports such as San Francisco and the Panama Canal, arriving at Le Havre port in France or at Brest port located nearby. From this place to Paris is an eighteen-hour journey by steam train. To Marseille is about a twenty-four-hour journey. The ship fare is somewhat cheaper compared to English and French ships. It is approximately 3,200 francs for first-class per person. If it is an American ship, payment can be made anywhere in actual dollars or by dollar exchange without any problem.

English ships have departures from Yokohama to their home country twice every month. French ships depart once per month. One should inquire about the departure dates, prepare the cargo, apply to the Yokohama courthouse to obtain a permit called a passport, and then board the ship. The necessity of this permit is that if illness or unexpected disasters occur in foreign countries, depending on the circumstances, one can present this permit to officials of treaty nations and receive appropriate protection

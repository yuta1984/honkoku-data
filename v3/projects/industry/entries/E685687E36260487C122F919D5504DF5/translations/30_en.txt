are many. However, depending on how the methods are established, the profits can be so enormous that they cannot be fully described. If, like the Western nations, trading companies were organized and collective strength combined to conduct commerce, how great would be the benefit to that country? Particularly with items like silkworm egg papers, since our country's merchants had never once engaged in overseas trading, foreigners thoroughly despise us, thinking that Japanese are all weak-spirited cowards who could never easily engage in overseas trade. They manipulate prices up and down according to their desires, all through their bargaining tactics, and our merchants are unable to control or suppress this. Even if some gain windfall profits from temporary market fluctuations, they ultimately fall into their traps and have their profits stolen away—this is deeply regrettable and lamentable, and indeed our merchants must also be said to bear responsibility. This is not because they cannot do it, but because they do not do it. Let me now cite examples from the past two or three years to demonstrate why this situation has come about.

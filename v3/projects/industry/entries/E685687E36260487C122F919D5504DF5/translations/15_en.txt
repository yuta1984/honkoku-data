exist. The weight of newly formed cocoons is about 650 for small ones and about 460 for large ones per kin (266 monme). On average, the number per kin is about 530.

Within the cocoon, the silkworm transforms its shape, becoming a brown, oval-shaped pupa. Its length is generally about 8 bu, with a diameter of about 3 bu. Later it transforms again into a butterfly. This is the second transformation. Generally, within about half a month to twenty days from the completion of the cocoon, the pupa sheds its shell on its own and finally breaks through the cocoon to emerge. It appears that it secretes liquid from its mouth, using this to moisten and soften the cocoon to bore a hole. As soon as they emerge from the cocoon, males and females each seek their mates and copulate, laying eggs within two days. The silk moths, both male and female, die quickly after laying eggs. In raising silkworms, from egg hatching to cocoon formation, one must pay constant attention and not be negligent even for half a day. When there are oversights in the method of cultivation, there will be enormous losses. Now, once the cocoons are completed

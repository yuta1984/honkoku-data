The 5th day, the second molting on the 10th day, the third on the 16th day, and the fourth on the 22nd day is the usual pattern. Of course, there may be slight variations in timing. After molting four times in this manner, the silkworms begin spinning silk around the 30th to 32nd day. When this stage is reached, they should be moved to wooden frames containing bundles of cherry birch branches, rapeseed stems, or similar materials, and feeding should be stopped. From this point, healthy silkworms will complete their cocoons in three and a half days, while slower ones take four days. These should be removed after seven to eight days, and preparations should be made to immediately boil them to death and extract the silk. Therefore, from the day the eggs are moved to the hatching room, complete success is achieved in 40-odd days to 51 or 52 days.

The silkworm's life is extremely short. Since it molts four times from hatching until cocoon formation, its life stages are divided into five periods.

In the first period (time of hatching), the room temperature should be 24 degrees Celsius

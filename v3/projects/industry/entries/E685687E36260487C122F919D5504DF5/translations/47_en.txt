One should pay the wharf fees, stevedore commissions, and shipping costs, and receive three copies of the bill of lading (English term for shipping certificate) or "connaissement" (French term) - the cargo receipt certificates - from the stevedore. Keep one copy yourself, entrust one to a traveling companion if you have one, or send it by letter to a suitable person at the destination as preparation for unforeseen circumstances. Store one copy safely, and upon the cargo's arrival in that country, use this certificate to exchange for the cargo when unloading. If you do not have this, it is a rule that the ship's captain will absolutely not hand over the cargo.

Thus, upon arrival in Marseilles, present the bill of lading to the ship's captain, submit the cargo manifest to the customs office, and after inspection is completed, deposit the cargo with an express shipping agent. Therefore, one must pay a small warehouse fee.

The port of Marseilles is a major French port, and many people traveling to European countries or going to England stop at this port. The customs office is located within the port.

The warehouse fee is approximately one and a half francs per box per month or more

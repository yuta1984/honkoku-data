then it is essential to boil and kill them before the moths emerge. (In this country, they are killed by drying) If left as they are, the moths will eat through and break out of the cocoons, causing holes to open in the cocoons and the silk threads to split into tens and hundreds of strands, making it impossible to obtain silk again.

The number of eggs laid by one moth ranges from 300 to over 500, with a minimum of over 200. According to a person named Hon Churuku, the average number is said to be 510. Initially they are pale yellow in color, after about 10 days they take on a brownish color, and after half a month they become bluish-gray.

(Note: In this country there are various colors such as yellow varieties and white varieties. What is described in the main text probably refers to the common Western variety)

Generally, if one keeps about 100 to 120 cocoons and allows the moths to emerge, one can obtain eggs weighing approximately 4 monme. However, when letting moths emerge, there should be equal numbers of females and males. The way to distinguish them is by the size of the cocoons - the female cocoons are considerably larger than the male ones. These eggs weighing 4 monme number approximately 20,000

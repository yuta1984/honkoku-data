appropriate. (Fahrenheit's thermometer is the most widely circulated in the world. The differences in degree divisions between Celsius and Fahrenheit are described in Yōgaku Benran, Second Collection.) Now, in about thirty days, the silkworm grows sufficiently. During this time, it molts four times, changing color each time (in Japan, this is called "shishi-taka-funaba no neoki" - the sleeping and waking of lion-hawk-boat-garden). Finally, it becomes grayish and somewhat transparent, reaching a length of about 2 sun 4 bu to 2 sun 8 bu. When the total body weight is measured at this point, approximately 20 to 35 individuals weigh one ounce (26 monme 6 bu). Compared to the initial weight when they first crawled out from the silkworm egg paper,

this represents a 4,000 to 6,000-fold increase. Upon examining the silkworm's body, there are two fine, long vessels. These vessels are coiled and twisted throughout, comprising nearly more than half of the entire body. The vessels are filled with a viscous, thick liquid like honey. Once the silkworm has fully grown, it gradually expels this liquid through two small holes in its mouth. As the liquid emerges, it forms soft threads, and the two strands combine to become just one strand, which quickly dries upon contact with air. The silkworm initially uses this thread to

Fahrenheit 75 degrees is considered best.

For the second period (post first-sleep stirring), Celsius 22.5 degrees or Fahrenheit 72 degrees is best.

For the third period (post second-sleep stirring), from Celsius 22 to 21 degrees, or Fahrenheit 71.5 to 70 degrees, gradually cooling is considered good.

For the fourth period (post third-sleep stirring), Celsius 20.5 degrees or Fahrenheit 69 degrees is appropriate.

For the fifth period (from post fourth-sleep stirring to cocoon formation), Celsius 20.5 degrees, that is Fahrenheit 69 degrees, is optimal. Even when cool, do not let it become cooler than 20 degrees, that is, Fahrenheit 68 degrees.

As mentioned before, the number of silkworms hatching from eggs weighing 4 monme is approximately 14,000, and the space required for housing them should be gradually increased as follows:

For the first period: 1 shaku-tsubo, from 3.5 to 4.5 units

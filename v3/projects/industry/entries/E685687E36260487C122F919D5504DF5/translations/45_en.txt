should be taken care of. This is considered the most essential item for ocean travel. After departing Yokohama, the ship anchors at Shanghai for approximately one day or one night. During this time, one may stay aboard ship or go ashore to lodge at a hotel (traveler's inn) as one pleases. However, when there is an anchorage, it is customary to stay at a hotel. At the hotel, dinner costs ten shillings, breakfast six shillings, and lunch four shillings, totaling one pound, or about five dollars, allowing one to lodge in the same manner as Western first-class passengers. One should know that Hong Kong and other ports have costs that generally correspond to these.

Regarding the transport of the aforementioned cargo, the danger of shipwreck cannot be dismissed. Therefore, even if there should be the peril of capsizing and sinking, there is a system where, for a small premium, compensation for such losses can be arranged. This is called marine insurance, and every country has insurance companies, with Yokohama also having branch offices. Now, the insurance method estimates the value of silkworm egg cards at two dollars per sheet per box, and with a sum of five hundred dollars, marine insurance is arranged for that amount.

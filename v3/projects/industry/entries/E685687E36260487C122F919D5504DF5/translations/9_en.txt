Next, regarding paper, although our country's manufacturing methods are superb and there are various different types that are sufficient to serve all kinds of uses, when it comes to printing with lead type following Western methods or making gunpowder cartridge wrapping, our country's paper proves to be rather unsuitable. Moreover, in those countries they use cotton and hemp as raw materials for paper, so they gather even thread scraps less than one shaku long and cloth fragments less than half a sun, collecting everything to

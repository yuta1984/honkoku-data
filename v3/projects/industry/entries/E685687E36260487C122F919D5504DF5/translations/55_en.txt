(Including travel expenses: 800 dollars per person)

Total: 15,860 dollars (However, if only one person goes, 5,000 dollars should be deducted from this amount)

Net profit of 184,000 dollars and more (As a trial calculation, if we take one million sheets, there should be a profit of about 3.5 million dollars. If sold at 5 dollars per sheet, after deducting the personnel expenses mentioned above, there remains a profit of over 130,000 dollars. Even at 4 dollars per sheet, there would be a profit of 84,000-85,000 dollars)

When returning, bringing back foreign currency is quite inconvenient, so one should go to a money changer and arrange for bills of exchange to bring back. Most conveniently, in the ports of Europe and Asia, there is a British commercial house called the Oriental Bank (in Yokohama, it is located at No. 11 Kaigan Igirisu [British Waterfront]), and it is very convenient to arrange with them.

If money is needed during the journey, one should initially use what is called a Circular Note (a bill of exchange like a circular letter, which is very convenient. This system does not yet exist in Japan at all. To conduct business on a grand scale, it would be desirable to have this arrangement). This is because this commercial house exists in every port where mail ships call around the world, so by simply issuing a bill of exchange, any amount can be received.

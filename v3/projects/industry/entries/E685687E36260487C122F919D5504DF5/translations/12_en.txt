when it spits out and manufactures itself. Now, the moth that emerges from the transformed pupa is white with a pale gray tinge. The eggs of this moth are gray with a slight bluish color. The paper on which these eggs are clustered and attached is called silkworm egg paper (tanegami). The size of one egg is roughly the same as a poppy seed. In warm countries, these eggs naturally hatch at normal temperatures and crawl out from the paper. In cold countries, artificial warmth is sometimes applied to promote hatching. The color of these newly hatched insects is brown,

and they grow by eating tree leaves as food. Among these, mulberry leaves are the most suitable food. To raise these insects, the temperature must not be colder than 20 degrees Celsius, which is 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Even if hot, as long as it is below 37 degrees Celsius, which is 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit, they will not be harmed by the heat. Therefore, the place for raising them should be kept at a warmth between 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit, which is extremely

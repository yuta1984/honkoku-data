The number of days for growth is shorter than previously mentioned. In places like the East Indies, there are locations where silkworms are raised four times per year. This is because mulberry production is extremely abundant in those regions, and the leaves grow rapidly, providing ample opportunity to raise silkworms repeatedly.

Japan has two varieties - spring silkworms (haruko) and summer silkworms (natsuko) - allowing for two cultivation cycles. This is likely due to the warmer climate compared to the West and the abundance of mulberry trees.

Also, in the Lombardy region of Italy, there is a type of silkworm that molts only three times. Therefore, the rearing period is said to be four to five days shorter than other silkworms.

The color of the silk thread varies: white, pale yellow, golden yellow, or slightly reddish. The length of a single thread ranges from 120,000 to 170,000 jō, with an approximate weight of 4 monme. The thickness ranges from 0.004 shi 1 kotsu to 8 shi 2 kotsu 5 bi, which corresponds to 1/120th to 1/240th of one kyokushaku bu. However, this thread is not perfectly round, as mentioned earlier

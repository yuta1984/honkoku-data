Poor performance during the resting periods in the rearing room indicates silkworms that are either too cold or have been kept too warm.

If there are dead silkworms after the lion stage resting period, this indicates silkworms that have been exposed to humid drafts through gaps in the sliding doors or have been affected by toxic air.

When many silkworms with thin heads appear during the hawk stage resting or the boat stage sleeping periods, and their mulberry leaf cutting is poor, this indicates either overcrowding or poor quality of the original silkworm eggs. Also, if many shrunken silkworms appear during the boat stage, this indicates exposure to excessive heat.

There are also silkworms called "居知らず" (restless ones). These have various regional names. This condition occurs frequently in silkworms that have been poorly managed regarding temperature and have been exposed to cold and dampness. It also occurs frequently in silkworms that develop mold around their resting areas.

Sometimes silkworms frequently climb to the edges of their containers. This indicates silkworms that are slightly damaged from overcrowding and have underlying health issues, then exposed to wind, rain, heat, and humidity. This is also called the "wild nature" of silkworms.

When thunderstorms occur frequently, doors should be closed immediately. This is very toxic to silkworms and leads to various diseases.

When silkworms' heads suddenly turn red in the rearing room and they don't progress in eating mulberry leaves, this indicates silkworms that were overheated during the young larval stage or exposed to heat from fires.

When silkworms cannot shed their skin during molting, this indicates either poor preparation of mulberry leaves or contamination with wood fragments that have injured the silkworms' backs, leading to disease. In new buildings...

Also, if you sweep the silkworms with a feather, the newly hatching silkworms will be hurt a little. With this in mind, even the silkworms attached to the egg paper should be very gently swept into containers with a feather, mulberry should be sprinkled with good moderation, and they should be slowly spread in all directions and made thin. At this time, the silkworms from one sheet of eggs should be spread thinly without unevenness over approximately three shaku square. The containers can be anything, but should be divided into many parts so that the silkworms do not rub against each other. On the first day, if using chopped mulberry (funabe), feed them about two to three times a day; if using cut mulberry leaves, feed them four to five times a day. This will also require slight adjustments depending on fair or rainy weather. After that, they should be placed in a somewhat warm location. The shelving locations should also be set up in about three places - on cool days place them in warm locations, on days with strong warmth place them in slightly cool locations, and adjust according to the passage of clouds. If mulberry leaves are available, feed them leaves as quickly as possible. Use mulberry sieves appropriate for the silkworms, and later use ones with coarser mesh. Furthermore, there are various methods in different regions, and each should follow what is appropriate for them. From then on, twice a day, use thin-pointed chopsticks to spread out the silkworm droppings. This is a top secret of pre-molting care, a method to dry the silkworms' living quarters and prevent mold from forming.

Every day before giving mulberry, use chopsticks to distribute silkworms from thick areas to thin areas, then sprinkle mulberry evenly and feed them. If rainy weather continues and there is moisture in the silkworm droppings, sprinkle coarse rice bran little by little over the silkworms and immediately feed them mulberry. This is also to dry the silkworm droppings. The adjustment of hot and cold temperatures during the four to five days after the silkworms emerge is especially crucial. If care is poor during the seven to eight days from this point, various diseases will develop later. Great care should be taken. Also, during young rearing, if north winds come, they will not eat mulberry at all, or the silkworms will disappear and die. This should be kept in mind. Being too warm is also bad. Prepare ventilation holes in all directions beforehand, make the opening and closing of doors flexible at this time, and adjusting by observing the passage of clouds frequently is of primary importance. Generally, neglectful care causes diseases in silkworms and their nature becomes poor. Not knowing this, many people panic and make a fuss when things suddenly turn bad later. Poor harvests later have their origins earlier - this should be understood. The adjustment of temperature varies from house to house, so

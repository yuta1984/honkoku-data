should be deeply considered, looked up to, and revered.

According to the Yurai Honki:
On the day of Kinoe-ne (first day of the sexagenary cycle), purify the household and worship the silkworm deity in the northwest direction. Set up two mulberry branches, place cocoon rice cakes (rice dumplings shaped like silkworm cocoons) on mulberry leaves as offerings, and present sacred sake in worship.

According to the Shitenkansho:
If the wind blows from the east on the first Jōshin day of the first month, the silkworms will be good that year.

According to the Zoku Seikai Ki:
In China, there was a man named Zhang Cheng who saw a woman in a village building a silkworm room in the southeast of her house. He taught her, saying: "If you offer white rice porridge and worship the silkworm deity on the 15th day of the first month, the prosperity of silkworms will always increase a hundredfold." When the woman followed his teaching, she indeed obtained profit.

According to Cui Shi:
During the Qingming festival in the third month, one should clean the house thoroughly, block holes in all four directions, paper the windows, and take out and prepare all tools used for sericulture.

According to the Longyu Hetu:
If silkworm droppings are buried in the northwest direction of the house, the silkworms of that household will surely prosper.

According to the Dongfang Shuo Zhanshu:
If there is no wind and the weather is clear on New Year's Day, the silkworms will be good that year.

Precautions for When Silkworms Are Born

When spring arrives, take out the seeds you intend to hatch early that year around the spring equinox, ensure they don't become damp, and hang them in a high place where mice cannot reach. This should also be adjusted for earliness or lateness depending on the cold and warmth of the particular location. Attach strings above and below the seeds and switch their hanging position between top and bottom every other day. The reason is that even in places like attic spaces, though the difference between upper and lower positions is slight, there are temperature variations, and the seeds placed higher will turn blue earlier and silkworms will emerge sooner. In any case, adjustments should be made so that everything becomes uniform and the silkworms all emerge at once.

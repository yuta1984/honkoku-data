night soil should be applied. In this way, one tree can yield ten trees through layering.
First, since layering grows quickly, one must pay careful attention without negligence.
Generally, mulberry is fifty percent more profitable than other crops, so
it should be planted without gaps at two shaku intervals on field ridges. However, the procedure
for planting is to pull back about two shaku inward from the field ridge, dig deeply, cut off the main
root of the mulberry, place the roots into the hole facing the interior of the field, add stable manure or
roadside compost into it and cover with soil, then afterwards apply night soil again.
Even though we speak of the mulberry's lifespan, what lasts ten years can produce strong growth and budding
for twenty years.

Chapter Four《Marginal note: Mulberry for early leaf cultivation and methods for early mulberry budding during severe frost》
Depending on the year's weather, mulberry may be troubled by the need for early leaf cultivation. When one wants to
use such mulberry early, take one field where mulberry has been planted abundantly, make it into spring
plowland, apply night soil once during winter, and apply it once more in spring.
This will cause budding four to five days earlier. Generally, when sowing
wheat and such, one should be mindful to sow it about two shaku away
from the mulberry roots. When frost falls, the earth's breath rises and the plants do not wither. Also,
during severe frost, all the mulberry may wither. At such times, immediately dig up the mulberry
roots, apply night soil heavily, and after about two days have passed, [apply] rotted shochu lees

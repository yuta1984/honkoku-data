Picking up the silkworms and pulling out their rear ends afterwards is a secret
tradition of sericulture. However, the mounting frames should be quite thin for mounting, and they should be mounted in warm places above the beams. Especially if the silkworms are excellent ones raised properly as described above, there is no problem even if they are mounted in places exposed to wind.
　　　Chapter 19: On How to Roast Cocoons During Long Rains
Cocoons should be exposed to sunlight immediately on the sixth day from mounting. Also, when the season is delayed due to long rains, a furnace should be constructed in the kitchen according to the number of baskets one possesses.

The furnace should be constructed with a height of three shaku and about eight vertical posts. The method of construction is as follows: make the bottom about one shaku narrow and vertically wide, apply wooden laths and plaster the walls. Inside, light plenty of charcoal fire, burn a little straw to moderate the strength of the fire, place three bamboo poles about two shaku and five sun high from the fire's edge, place cocoon baskets on them, cover with persimmon paper, and cover that with Ryukyu cloth to prevent air from escaping. After a while, when you touch them, moisture will appear on the cocoons. After that, when you touch them again and the cocoons have dried, use this as a signal to move the baskets.

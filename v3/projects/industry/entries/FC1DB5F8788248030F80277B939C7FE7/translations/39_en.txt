　　Chapter 16: On Silkworm Rearing in New Houses
It is a mistake for ordinary people to understand that new houses are cold.
Rather, in new houses, during the day, sunlight penetrates strongly through the base of the thatched roof,
and the heat does not dissipate until around 10 PM at night, causing the silkworms on the upper shelves
to immediately become uneven and all perish without exception.
Generally, in new houses, one should stretch oiled paper high on the ceiling, endure the cold from dawn
until around 10 PM, and from before noon,
move the silkworms down to the lower shelves. Moreover, all the northwest high windows and partition
doors should be left open. Also, houses with re-thatched roofs

are the same. In most cases, one should use patch-thatching
and not completely re-thatch the roof. However, for new houses, one should
reduce the number of silkworm varieties from before and
raise them in the area below the lintel. Also, for houses built before raising silkworms,
one should be careful from the time of new construction to use the lower areas, and the partition walls should be left as
wooden lathing without applying earth plaster. In addition, in each room,
high windows for north-south ventilation should be opened between the girders and lintels,
and all should be kept open from midday. However, when building a house with silkworm rearing
in mind, the horizontal space should be made wide.

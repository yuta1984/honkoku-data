For mulberry seeds during rain, crush them and wrap in a fresh hand towel, wring out the water, and then give to the silkworms. Generally, do not give rain-soaked mulberry leaves. For attached mulberry seeds, give for two days, then from the third day give mulberry leaves. Originally they should be raised with mulberry leaves. Also, during the larval stage, put cut mulberry in a winnowing basket, blow out the leaves, discard the stems, and give to the silkworms. Generally, up to the garden area, use cut mulberry for feeding. However, when feeding mulberry, give it quite thinly, and before they finish eating that mulberry, pack more on top.

For silkworms about to molt, make the droppings quite thin and give intensive mulberry feeding frequently. When it appears to be the final feeding, cut the mulberry a bit coarser and give it to them. This way they hide under the mulberry and do not suffer from heat. However, when cold winds are severe and molting is difficult, quickly remove the floating ones and let them molt elsewhere. Additionally, in Ōshū they do not remove the floating ones but let all of them molt, giving shaken mulberry until half have awakened, then at this point reduce mulberry twice and continue feeding as is. This is also a good technique. However, the molting period should be managed using first-rate methods appropriate to the timing.

Such is the case. At such times, one should hang reed screens or similar outside the shoji screens. Generally, in houses without high windows, it is difficult to manage the heat. Therefore, one should open smoke vents and high windows and raise silkworms while receiving the northwest wind. However, when mulberry leaves have been given, it does not matter if they dislike the wind. In any case, silkworms suffer when they are away from mulberry leaves or during the peak heat of their resting period. At such times, even if they do not all wake up together, one should quickly provide mulberry leaves. Also, in the morning, raise the resting silkworms to the upper shelf, lower them to the middle tier of the shelf from midday, and move the silkworms that have been given mulberry leaves

Originally, the shelf space used for the fourth molting should be spread out throughout the house without exception during the third molting period, and during intense heat, lower them to the bottom shelf - there must be no negligence. However, seeing that many shelves are occupied, people begin to prepare other shelves, making it difficult to weather sudden heat and causing problems with the silkworms on the upper shelves. One should be mindful in this way. From the eighth hour of day (2 PM), do not make strong fires inside the house. Even those who placed braziers before the second molting or covered them with night clothes and quilts for rearing may well encounter this situation.

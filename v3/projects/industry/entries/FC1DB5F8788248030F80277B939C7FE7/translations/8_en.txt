Illustration of silkworm egg hatching method

【Left Page】
Silkworms are indeed the most valuable insects under heaven, serving as a source of livelihood for men and women through their hard labor. Therefore, even those who are not lacking in gold and silver, if their land is suitable, should devote their attention to sericulture. They should watch for the time when silkworms emerge, make preparations accordingly, and from the day of hatching until the time of mounting (placing silkworms on frames to spin cocoons), they should not leave the site and carefully nurture them. During cool days, they should focus on farming work, and during hot days, they should not leave home but provide mulberry leaves and pay attention to weather changes. However, women tend to be careless and often neglect proper care and feeding.

Regarding the "sweeping down" process (removing newly hatched silkworms from the egg papers):
The first and second persons hold the front and back of the egg paper over continuation paper and use bamboo chopsticks to tap the back of the silkworm eggs to make them fall. The third person shakes the paper when silkworms have attached to it, dropping the empty eggshells. If the eggshells are not removed, there will be late-emerging silkworms that will compete for food, resulting in many defective cocoons during the resting period before mounting.

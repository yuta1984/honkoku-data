disliked. If it is simply cold, do not rush, and though they may have difficulty eating mulberry, such silkworms will quickly progress from the second molt stage with good mulberry advancement, with no waste whatsoever during mounting. However, silkworms that have night clothes or futon placed over them before the larval stage, kept beside fires, or have braziers placed in paper curtains to keep them strongly warmed, even though they may develop beautifully until the larval stage, will have difficulty eating mulberry from the second molt onward, become uneven, fail to mount properly, and become waste. Silkworms that deteriorate during the second molt stage in this way can be identified from the initial raising through the larval dormancy period. The reliability of rearing

can be known when silkworms placed on shelves from the day of initial raising, with nothing placed over them and raised in the cold, should be understood to mount fully. Also, understand that those strongly warmed will not remain for mounting and become waste. If you do not forget these two principles and have this understanding when enduring cold, there should be no mistakes. Some say that if it becomes cold before the larval stage, the silkworms will become fuzzy, but this is greatly mistaken. If there are many silkworm eggs on the night of initial raising, even if left in the garden courtyard for one night, they will not become fuzzy. Most often during initial raising

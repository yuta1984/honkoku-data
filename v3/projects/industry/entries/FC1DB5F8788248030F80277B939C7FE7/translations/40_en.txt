The area under the girders should be made high, with no walls inside, and the northwest should be entirely

From hatching to the "boat" stage (a growth phase of silkworms), one should not
raise silkworms on a second floor where north winds blow in unfavorably. When rearing
without proper basis, one should always keep them close to mulberry leaves. However,

change the silkworms' bedding once every two days. When the silkworm bedding is too high (thick),

yard-preparation should not be elevated. Depending on how mulberry is given from the yard,
it should be raised accordingly. Also, when placing silkworms on the second floor, one should not
burn fires too strongly below. Additionally, when there are strong southern winds with intense sunshine, mulberry...

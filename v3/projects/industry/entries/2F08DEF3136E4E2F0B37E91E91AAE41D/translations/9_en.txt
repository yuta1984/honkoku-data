When the time comes,
So that not even the grass leaves
Of the people are missed,
Does the lord perhaps
Spread the dew
Of benevolence?
Vice-Minister

【Main text】
During the reign of Emperor Yomei, the 32nd Human Emperor, Prince Shotoku assisted in all governmental affairs, took pity on the people, and taught them the art of sericulture, as recorded in the Kujiki (Records of Ancient Matters).

The Prince said: "Raising silkworms is like parents nurturing their infant children. You should care for silkworms as you would care for your own children. Adjust the temperature and climate as you would for your own body - neither too warm nor too cold, maintaining a peaceful atmosphere, and devote your energy day and night without interruption."

The wise rulers of old extended their benevolence to all generations, established the people's industries, and the empresses and consorts personally gathered mulberry leaves, teaching that the way of sericulture is women's work. If even those of noble status do such work, how much more should those of lower stations diligently devote themselves to this essential occupation.

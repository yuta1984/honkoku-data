Face them west, grafting in the same form they previously had. Provide shade covering and ensure that water does not enter the graft joint. There are also various grafting methods called "toritsugi" (take-grafting) or "nage-ire tsugi" (throw-in grafting). Currently, in a place called Yamamoto in Settsu Province, there are experts who make it their profession to graft various trees or do cutting propagation. There should also be many experts in other provinces, so one should learn by following such people.

Around the 88th night of spring, when silkworms emerge, heavy frost sometimes falls and the mulberry buds are damaged and wither. At such times, shaded areas naturally have their frost melt, and since they receive the morning sun after the mulberry's vital energy has returned, the mulberry buds are not severely damaged. In sunny locations, however, the morning sun shines before the vital energy has returned, causing the frost to melt rapidly, so the young buds are damaged as if scalded. At such times, it is said that rising early in the morning and vigorously sprinkling water on the mulberries reduces the damage. It is also good to dig deep around the mulberry roots and put manure directly in. When this is done, damaged mulberries will sprout new buds within 48 hours and can be used for that year's silkworms. However, it is also said that frost-damaged mulberry is poisonous to silkworms.

On the Method of Mulberry Layering

For mulberry layering, select and plant quite good mulberry trees, and when they reach about three years of age, cut them about one shaku above the ground on a clear day in spring. Many young shoots will emerge from the cut stump. Apply fertilizer to these frequently. The following spring, space those branches about seven sun apart, leaving one young shoot each and removing the rest. Slightly scratch the bark with your nail where the leaves attach to those branches to create wounds, then stand all the remaining young shoots upright, press them down, and bury them deeply as shown in the diagram, trampling to firmly compact the soil. That year's

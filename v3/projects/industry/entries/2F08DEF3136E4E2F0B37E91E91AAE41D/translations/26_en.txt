They particularly devour young mulberry shoots, making them look like dead trees. At such times, insect expulsion is performed, with various methods existing in different regions. In the Chugoku region, people pray to the silkworm deity or visit their tutelary deity, make straw dolls or straw horses, place a few mulberry insects on them, and while beating gongs and drums or blowing conch shells and flutes, children and youngsters gather in large numbers, chanting "Send away the mulberry insects, go to the offing!" while parading around the mulberry trees and sending them toward rivers. This is called insect expulsion. There is also a disease called "same" that affects mulberry trees, turning the bark purple and causing them to wither. During rainy weather, this should be scraped off with bamboo spatulas or similar bamboo implements.

When asked why he was sorting them, Cai Shun replied, "Now the country is in chaos and famine has come. I have an aged mother. I offer the ripe fruit to my mother, and use the unripe ones for my own food." The bandit leader was greatly moved and gave him one sack of rice and one ox leg before departing. Cai Shun's virtuous conduct goes without saying, but even such evil men were moved by his sincere actions and felt compassion. Truly, "human nature is good" - is this not what this refers to? However, this was likely due to being influenced by Cai Shun's virtue and righteousness.

　　　On a famous mulberry tree that appeared in Zhuo County, China
In a place called Zhuo County in China, there was a hero. He was a descendant of Liu Sheng, the Jing King of Zhongshan of the Han dynasty, and great-great-grandson of Emperor Jing. His surname was Liu, given name Bei, and courtesy name Xuande. Having lost his father at a young age, his family was extremely poor. He served his mother with filial piety and treated others with deep courtesy and deference. He ordinarily wove mats or made shoes for a living, and liked to associate with heroes. Beside this house there was a mulberry tree that grew with luxuriant branches and leaves year after year, shaped like a carriage canopy. Everyone considered this strange. A man named Ji Ding, seeing this mulberry tree, said, "The mulberry is one of the four trees. That this tree flourishes so is an auspicious sign that a noble person who will rule the realm will surely emerge from this house." Indeed, later Xuande formed a brotherhood with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei in the Peach Garden, destroyed the Yellow Turban bandits, gained Kongming as his strategist, divided the realm into three parts, and the states of Wu, Wei, and Shu stood together while he displayed his mighty reputation. This is described in detail in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, so I will omit it here.

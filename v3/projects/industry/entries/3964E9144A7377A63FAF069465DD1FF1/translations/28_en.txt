Through the civilizing influence of the present enlightened age, the common people prosper abundantly, clothing and food are plentifully distributed, the elderly wear silk and eat meat, suffering neither hunger nor cold, and rest peacefully upon their beds and mats. Master Uegaki (Uegaki Morikuni) once had his household members diligently engage in the work of silkworm rearing and silk reeling, and moreover made detailed and thorough study of the techniques of raising them. Though this may be women's livelihood, it is also an urgent matter of royal governance. Thus he had it carved in printing blocks. If households throughout the world that raise silkworms take the methods of rearing from this book, it will surely be beneficial. Early spring of Kyōwa 2, Year of the Water Dog [1802]

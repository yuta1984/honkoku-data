In a place called Handan in the state of Zhao in China, there was a beautiful woman named Luofu. With a face like a flower, eyebrows like mist, and graceful appearance, none could match her beauty. One day, while she was picking mulberries by the riverside, passersby were captivated by Luofu's beauty, became entranced and lost their spirits, lingering hesitantly in the streets.

At that time, the King of Zhao went out hunting and saw Luofu from inside his carriage. He summoned her to enter the palace to serve as his consort, but she firmly declined and maintained her integrity.

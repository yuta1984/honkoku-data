　　　On the dormancy and care of second instar
Until the dormancy period of the second instar silkworms, the bedding straw should be replaced every other day. For mulberry preparation, use knives, chopping tools and the like appropriate for the silkworms, cutting somewhat coarsely, then pass this through a sieve of about five-bu square, and use a winnowing basket to remove wood fragments and dust, making it to a good degree and sprinkling it evenly for feeding. During rainy weather, mold and such may develop on the silkworms' bedding straw. At such times, sprinkle coarse rice bran little by little over the silkworms, then feed them mulberry. When the bedding straw dries, the silkworms will eat the mulberry well. Even during this second instar dormancy, there comes a time for intensive mulberry feeding, and when the silkworms emerge on top, stop feeding mulberry as before, cover with a net to align the silkworms. In regions without nets, place straw markers as mentioned before, pick up young silkworms with chopsticks, and place sleeping silkworms in high places so they wake up early. Also, feed the picked young silkworms plenty of mulberry so they can catch up with the faster silkworms. Wait for the sleeping silkworms to wake up together before feeding them mulberry. This period is called "resting mulberry." For this resting mulberry, dry mulberry from mountain hills without moisture is bad. The reason is that since the silkworms have stopped eating for a while, they tend to be somewhat dry. Therefore, select moist Japanese mulberry for feeding. All four periods of resting mulberry should be done this way.

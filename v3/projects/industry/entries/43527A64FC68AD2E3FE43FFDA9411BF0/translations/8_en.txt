About the silkworms' dwelling arrangement and care
During the ship stage (second instar) of silkworms, as before, change their bedding every two days and spread the silkworms thinly. The mulberry leaves should be matched to the silkworms, prepared somewhat coarsely and fed to them. Temperature control is also important at this time. You must not neglect their care. Pressed mulberry and scattered mulberry are the same as before.

《As a song》Rest the ship stage, avoid wind and moisture, and press the mulberry
In hot weather, stop lighting fires, use doors and sliding screens

An example of surviving long rains during the silkworms' prime time

One year, from the ship stage of silkworms until the garden rising, it was rainy weather, and particularly cold winds blew fiercely, causing silkworms to suffer greatly in various places. However, an elderly person in a certain village devised a method: he enclosed the silkworms' location with doors and sliding screens, lit fires in three or four places inside to warm the silkworms, and raised them so that warmth circulated throughout the house. As a result, they were not damaged by rain and moisture and produced an excellent crop.

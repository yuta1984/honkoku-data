　　　　On the various methods for making cocoons in different provinces
Now, when all the silkworms become transparent like crystal, they search around for places to hide and build their nests. This is called "hikiru" in the eastern provinces and "sugaku" in the central provinces. The methods for making cocoons vary by region. First, I will describe the general approaches. In the Ōshū region, they fold up the edges of straw mats about two sun (approximately 6 cm), tie bamboo supports diagonally inside, and fold straw in bundles of three or four pieces into triangular shapes as shown in the diagram. These are arranged standing in the mats, and the mature silkworms are scattered into them. They are placed in slightly heated, warm locations to make cocoons. This is called "ebira" and also known as "mabushi" (cocooning frames).

In the Tango, Tanba, and Tajima regions, they bend brushwood branches as shown in the diagram, arrange them between the shelves, put the silkworms among them, and let each climb up at will to make cocoons. They also take those that have climbed onto the brushwood and move them to other, slightly warmer

locations, arranging them there to make cocoons. Three days later, in what is called "miwake" (separation), they separate the brushwood to let in air and dry the cocoons.

In Gōshū (Ōmi Province), as shown in the diagram, they hang two ropes each from places like the back of the second floor, thread bamboo tubes without joints through these ropes, and suspend the silkworm shelves as illustrated. When feeding mulberry leaves, they raise and lower the straw mats along with the shelf boards freely. When the silkworms enter cocooning stage, they spread bamboo screens on these shelves.

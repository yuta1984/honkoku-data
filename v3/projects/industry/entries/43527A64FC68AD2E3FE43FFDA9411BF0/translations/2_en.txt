Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Wakamusuhi-no-kami (the Young Producing Spirit) taught the way of raising silkworms. Ukemochi-no-kami (the Food Goddess) created cocoons, and thus began the art of drawing silk threads.
The reason it is said to "arise from the eyebrow" is that cocoons resemble silkworm eyebrows. Seeing silkworms produce threads from their mouths, the technique of reeling silk also began. Furthermore, Wakahirume-no-mikoto resided in the Sacred Weaving Hall and presided over divine purification rituals. Therefore, this deity is revered as the protective god of thread, cotton, and all clothing. Since these are divine teachings, impure matters are strictly taboo in weaving halls.

The best seeds are those that are well-uniform in appearance, with strong vitality, eggs that are slightly swollen inside, seeds with good texture and firmness, moths that work well, and good seed distribution. They should have no bad odor, not fall during handling, and adhere well to paper - these are considered the finest quality. When collecting seeds, moths should be selected and sorted, with inferior butterflies named "baku" and separated out. Butterflies are classified into upper, middle, and lower grades. Seeds from good butterflies are expensive, while seeds from poor butterflies should be known as cheap. The color of seeds reflects the characteristics of the local soil. If raised on mulberry from red soil, the seeds become reddish, and when raised on mulberry from black soil, the seeds take on a slightly blackish tint. Seeds that have eaten mulberry from true soil are balloon flower colored and appear slightly mottled like frost. Regardless of seed color, the finest seeds are those raised using proper breeding methods with high-quality mulberry grown in good riverside locations anywhere in the country, using cut mulberry leaves or picked mulberry leaves. The next grade has various names like "bawaki," "butsu-kiri," or "koro-dane." Moths with poor characteristics are called "haku" because they resemble the color of barley rice. Moths with good characteristics are said to be like white rice. If one wishes to produce superior cocoons throughout the provinces, one should carefully examine the quality of the seeds. There are large cocoons where two or three silkworms have nested together in one cocoon. When these are made into thread, many knots form, making them very poor quality. Therefore, these should be removed and made into silk wadding instead. Seeds taken from such large cocoons come from many provinces. Such seeds should not be sought. The finest seeds should be known as those taken from superior silkworms that were fed the best mulberry of that year. If there is even the slightest negligence in breeding methods, excess or deficiency in mulberry feeding, poor original seeds, or

inauspicious events in the household, exposure to exceptional cold or heat during the four molting periods, or cocoon formation during windy and rainy seasons - if even one of these obstacles exists, those seeds will definitely not produce good silkworms. One should thoroughly examine the seed source and seek superior seeds. Foolish people do not understand this principle and many believe that the quality of silkworms depends on the year's fortune or their own luck. This is a great mistake. This applies not only to silkworms but even more so to all living things. Even all plants and trees resemble their parents. For example, planting seeds from astringent persimmons will not produce sweet persimmons. While some people may obtain decent silkworms even from poor seeds depending on the year's fortune, this is due to that year's favorable conditions.

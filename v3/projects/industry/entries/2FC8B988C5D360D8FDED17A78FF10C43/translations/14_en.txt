This should be done. If you apply mulberry thickly when they are yellow without understanding this principle, it will not only waste mulberry but also harm the silkworms. Once they shrink and stand up, cut mulberry is good after bottom removal.

△There are many things that silkworms abhor: the smell of human waste, winds from the southwest direction, western sunlight, wet leaves, hot leaves, leaves with bird droppings, the smell of burning sardines, the smell of boiling soybeans, incense and fragrances, soot, camellia oil. One must not enter the silkworm house after eating lettuce. Such plants should not be planted nearby either. Among fragrant firewoods, magnolia and cedar types should not be burned. Mulberry leaves should be burned for disposal. In general, all impurities should be forbidden.

Beyond this, there are many excellent theories from various houses regarding silkworms. I have detailed these in my work "Sōsan Kakuyō" (Essentials of Mulberry and Silkworm Cultivation). This compilation merely strings together one or two of those points. However, if one raises silkworms for many years based on these rearing methods, one will naturally become skilled.

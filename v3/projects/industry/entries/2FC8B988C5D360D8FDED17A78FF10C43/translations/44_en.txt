In general, there is no hindrance for men and women engaged in sericulture to eat fish and fowl. Above all, one should avoid things with strong odors such as leeks, garlic, and scallions.

First, our family has followed the above methods for sericulture for several years.

Until the boat-child stage, we feed mulberry 5-6 times each, and when they reach the garden raising stage, we feed them three times daily. We place charcoal fire in the furnace of the silkworm room and tend to them as before. Therefore, we complete the process in 32-33 days, which is within the standard number of days.

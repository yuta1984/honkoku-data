Until the flying stage leading to cocoons, perform bottom removal daily. Always apply morning mulberry thickly. If mulberry remains uneaten, it is not good for bottom removal. For evening mulberry on the fifth and sixth days, it is good to spread it full on the straw platforms. However, if keeping them cool and making them eat, the evening mulberry on the seventh day should be applied thickly. They eat mulberry well and become noticeably ready to fly. If they fast, they will reach the great flying stage on the eighth day from the mulberry application day, and become cocoons on the ninth day. If it is cold, it may take over ten days.

△Put the flying silkworms into cocoon frames, raise them above the beams, and light fires below to keep them warm. The cocoons will be thick. Generally, put silkworms from one hundred straw platforms into fifty to sixty cocoon frames. If too many are put in, the cocoons will be thin with many large cocoons.

△Applying mulberry has gradations for all four molting stages. When they first wake up, they are yellow in color - apply thinly. When the color becomes white, apply somewhat thickly. When they become blue, it is their prime eating time. Apply increasingly thickly. Even when satiated, they are not harmed. When approaching molting and their bodies shrink and stand up, they are yellow. Reduce the mulberry slightly, and from then gradually apply more thinly.

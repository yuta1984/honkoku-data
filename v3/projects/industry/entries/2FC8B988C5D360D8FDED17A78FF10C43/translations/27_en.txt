Now, spread the rice hulls not too thickly, laying four sheets, and transfer the hatched silkworms mentioned above to paper. Cut mulberry leaves finely, spread them over the entire surface, gather them with bird feathers, gently mix together, and handle carefully with two chopsticks so as not to damage them. Transfer both the hatched silkworms and mulberry leaves sparsely onto the straw mat's paper lining, about one monme each. After finishing the division as described above, sprinkle mulberry leaves evenly and place them on high shelves.

In general, you should know that shelves are warmer toward the top. For one sheet of eggs, use a mat measuring about two shaku five sun across for feeding, and place the silkworms across the entire surface of the mat. In all cases, initially lay paper and handle them accordingly. If the mat is smaller than the aforementioned dimensions, use four to five sheets. Placing them too thickly is very bad. Growth will also not progress well. As mentioned before, if feeding is done too densely, the silkworms will not develop uniformly, which is bad.

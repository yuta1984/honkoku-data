When it reaches twenty-two to twenty-three times, perform bottom removal and transfer to different straw mats. The method is to gather the silkworms using bird feathers, pick them up with fingers, and spread the silkworms from one straw mat onto two straw mats. Have young girls pick up the silkworms remaining in the original straw. From the day approaching molting, gradually cut the mulberry finely and apply it thinly and frequently. At the eighth application, though this timing varies according to weather temperature, it generally takes about thirty-four to thirty-five times to reach the mulberry stopping point. The care during the first molting is crucial. If they molt without incident, there will be no difficulties throughout.

Applying mulberry thickly during molting will cause disease when the silkworms reach maturity.
△In the fourth initial molting, if even one-tenth of the silkworms wake up and eat mulberry while no silkworms are eating, stop the mulberry for one day. If you do not stop the mulberry, the silkworms that woke up first will eat, but the sleeping silkworms will not eat, and the silkworms will not be uniform. That night, cut the mulberry finely, apply it thinly, and prevent the silkworms that woke up first from starving. This is called "covering mulberry." The same applies until all wake up. On the day of mulberry stopping, light fires day and night, use charcoal, and keep the silkworm house warm. If it is cold, they will have difficulty waking up. Wear lined garments and test the silkworms

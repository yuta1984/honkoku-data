Cover them face down without wrapping, and let them rest for just a short while. When you open and examine the silkworm eggs, most will have attached to the mulberry leaves, and generally they will have moved to the paper. If there are not enough that have moved to the edges of the seed paper, tap from behind with your finger to flatten them so they gather together on the wrapping paper. Without concern for those that are beginning to hatch, cover them with separate paper as before, leaving some unwrapped on top, and place them on the shelf. The next morning, feed them as before, and in about three days

complete the feeding rounds. In particularly warm weather, they will all hatch in just a day or two. Regardless of which day they hatch, put them in separate straw bundles each day and flatten them. Regardless of quantity, include feeding, as mixing them will result in unevenness later, which is bad.
《Side note: The method of transferring these hatched silkworms to straw bundles is described later》
　Note: When hatching silkworm eggs, young women should purify themselves and wear one more layer of clothing than usual, then handle the silkworm eggs

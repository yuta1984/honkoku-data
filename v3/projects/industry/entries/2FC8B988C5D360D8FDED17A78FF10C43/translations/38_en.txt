and push and pull them, they will be surprisingly easy to raise. The silkworms will attach to the mabushi and will not fall off. When untying the middle knot on top of the ladder, it is good to straighten and raise the mabushi. When fair weather continues, it is the established method to lower them on the fourth day.

One: When the aforementioned mabushi are lowered on the fourth or fifth day, they should be set up four or five pieces at a time so that wind can enter. If they are placed thickly or piled up, the cocoons will become steamy and this is not good for extracting silk. From the day after lowering the mabushi, separate the large cocoons along with upper and lower grades, remove the straw padding, exclude the edges, arrange them in single rows, and dry them. Preferably, set them up on clean mats, wrap thin wood around both ends, and tie in five places. Fill the entire mat with arranged cocoons for drying.

{{Marginal note: That is, the shelf for raising the straw has three sections, but even one section's worth should be spread out and raised in four sections, one should understand}}

Dry in clear weather for three to four days. After that, sort and separate the cocoons into upper, middle, and lower grades

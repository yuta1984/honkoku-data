should be stopped. If the awakening is not uniform, do this again as before. When all have awakened completely, apply mulberry thinly, then gradually apply it thickly without unevenness. Generally, it is good to apply it four to five times per day.

Note: The awakened silkworms at this second stage are called taka-go (hawk silkworms). From this point forward, there is no need to spread rice hulls on the straw bundles; the silkworms should be separated and placed directly. The spreading of bran should be limited to three times in total: at the beginning of stirring, on the third day, and at the first awakening.

First, even after the silkworms have been separated and arranged as described above, they should be handled in the same manner as before.

Note: This stage is called funa-go (boat silkworms). Generally, from the initial stirring until this point, there are concerns, and men and women of substance should remain ritually pure and stay in the silkworm room, occasionally tending the charcoal fire in front

there will be variations in timing depending on the location. Generally, hatching should be done when mulberry leaves have sprouted to about one sun and four to five bu in length.

Note: It is established practice that silkworms begin to emerge as moths thirty-six days after hatching. Since sericulture generally reaches its peak during rice planting season, one should consider these timeframes and arrange schedules so as not to interfere with rice planting. Generally, after the silkworms begin to stir, much more mulberry is needed, and since it is also the time for cocoon formation, much labor is required. However, until the stirring begins, the care of gathering mulberry does not consume as much labor, so arrangements should be made in advance to ensure it does not interfere with farm work.

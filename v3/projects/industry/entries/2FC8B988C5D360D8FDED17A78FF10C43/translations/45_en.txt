Whether a year is good or bad depends entirely on one's diligence. Therefore, even those who surpass our sericulture follow this as their example.

First, during sericulture, the household should be quieter than usual. Even servants and children should refrain from arguments and quarrels. If there is any carelessness, it will be detrimental to that year's sericulture.

First, during sericulture, one should avoid death pollution. One should avoid visiting houses of misfortune or eating and drinking there for seven days. Birth pollution should be treated similarly. However, if such events occur in one's own household, there is no hindrance. If such events occur among close relatives and cannot be avoided, one should stay in a separate house and eat there for three days.

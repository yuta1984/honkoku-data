Although inducing egg-laying and hatching is said to be an ancient tradition, this too requires careful attention, so as stated in the main text, after hatching without fail, all men and women entering and leaving the silkworm room must maintain bodily cleanliness as the first priority. Now, if you place four or more sheets of silkworm eggs and make them all hatch at the same time, by the end it becomes unmanageable. At that time, even with just two sheets of eggs, feed them ten days before mid-April, and arrange for the remainder to hatch with an interval of six to seven days

spacing them out and flattening them. Two to three days before making all silkworms hatch at once, dry six to seven new straw mats flat《Side note: However, this should vary according to the number of silkworms》. Throughout the process, drying them hastily with strong sunlight is bad. They should be dried beforehand. Additionally, dry and sift rice hulls to make them clean, and place them in the silkworm room. When feeding the silkworms, wipe the mats with mugwort《Side note: This is to purify the impurities of the straw bundles. Both leaves and stems are used. It is good to use them throughout the entire process》

Then it is good to raise three mats at a time, raising about four sets in total. Board ceilings are bad. However, if it is a bamboo slat ceiling, it is good. Set it up so that mice cannot reach it. When raised up, the cocoons will form quickly. During this season, if it becomes particularly cold due to rain and such, a fire should be lit below. However, if pine wood is burned, the color of the cocoons will change. Miscellaneous wood should be burned instead. From there,

Keep them raised for about three nights, and lower them on the fourth day. However, if wind blows and it becomes cold from the day they were raised, they should be left up for five days before being lowered.

Note: To raise the mabushi (cocooning frames), wrap the mabushi straw coverings from both sides, carry the middle section uniformly with a ladder, and place them with good balance across the three ropes. When the middle knot is untied, they will separate to both sides. Then, without losing them, attach them to bamboo

　However, after drying for about ten days, or even after five or six days of drying, when it becomes well-dried and manageable,
　make it into large bundles. Bundles of three shaku five sun are large bundles. Especially store them so that night
　dew does not touch them. Evening showers and such are prohibited. Even if just three drops hit,
　spots will appear on the hemp.
One: Dry thoroughly in clear weather, wash in flowing water, and dry again. For the rotting
　method, immediately soak in fresh water, make a straw bed underneath and let rot for one and a half days,
　then soak in clear water and let rot for about two days. Some will peel at this point, and those with hard roots
　are soaked in fresh water again and allowed to rot.
　　　Method of Peeling Hemp Bark
One: Hold three or four stalks in the left hand, fold about two sun from the base, hold
　the hemp in the right hand, and scrape downward to the left with the thumb of the left hand,
　and the bark will come off. For long hemp, gather it up and scrape downward,
　throwing the bark to the far side. Especially when holding hemp in the right hand,

　Stack as many as desired this way, and when well stacked, fold in half again.
　Leave as is for about two days. Since it won't peel when dry, soak in water
　and leave it.
One: There are considerations about peeling ramie bark and soaking it in water. The nature of ramie is
　originally pale yellow, which becomes white when bleached. Rice ash and lime are
　boiled in water, placed in flowing water for a long time, bleached again, and bleached once more to become very
　white. For spinning ramie fiber, a foot-operated spinning wheel is used. The loom tools are the same as
　for cotton.

Lord Masunari of Kuroha, near Nasuno in Shimotsuke Province, governs his people with compassion and does not disdain the work of encouraging agriculture. With his dedication, he has turned his attention even to the craft of weaving women who draw silk thread from silkworm cocoons, from the young buds of mulberry trees in the gardens to the cocoon chambers of parent silkworms. He has investigated ancient matters from times of old as well as the pastimes of people close to him, examining this and contemplating that, creating this five-volume work like the catalpa bow.

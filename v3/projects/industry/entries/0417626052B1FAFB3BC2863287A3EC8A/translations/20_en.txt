　The threads are passed over and the thread ends are aligned onto the spools of the silk-reeling wheel in front.
1. For thread, take about five or six cocoons as one unit, and generally align twelve white threads together. This is the standard thickness of tezara (hand-reeled) thread. For karashi-tezara, the twelve threads are reduced to six or seven threads.
1. Soak the aligned threads in water while still on the spool. In winter, if you intend to twist in the early morning, soak from the evening for one night. In summer, if soaked for a whole night, the threads will rot. Consider this timing carefully.
1. When it comes time to twist, pull the spool from the water and immediately wind it onto spindles. The number of spindles is twelve, or ten, or twenty. If twelve, it becomes six when combined and twisted.
1. From single twist, combine again to make multiple twist. Work quickly so that the water does not dry. If the water dries, the thread becomes very poor.

1. For right thread twist, when twisting from below, turn inward, and for upper twist, turn outward. All ordinary silk threads are right-twisted threads.
1. For left thread twist, when twisting from below, turn outward, and for upper twist, turn inward. Tezara uses left-twisted thread.

1. To check the degree of twisting, twist it up and wind it on a spool, then remove it from the spool and immerse it in clean water to examine. If over-twisted, it will shrink up and not stretch at all. If under-twisted, it will not twist up and will hang loose. Consider finding the right degree.
1. The best season for thread twisting is May. Early morning, after the fourth hour (around 10 AM), is good. Midday is bad because the thread dries again. March-April and June-July are also good. When autumn winds rise, it is bad because the thread dries. When the thread dries after being placed on the spindle, wet a hand towel and gently moisten the thread.

1. For mulberry calculation, planting 410 mulberry trees in 5 se of field is said to be slightly more than enough to raise one batch of silkworms. Tie a 4-shaku circumference rope firmly, and define two coils as one se. With this calculation, one batch of silkworms requires 30 se, which equals 60 bundles. In terms of mulberry tree count, approximately 300 trees per batch of silkworms.
　　Silkworm eggs and rearing methods
1. Soak seed papers in water on a horse day during the cold season, leave for three days, then remove. Keep only the good eggs; it is said that the survival rate is good. Wrap the seeds in paper and hang them. At the end of March or beginning of April, when mulberry buds begin to sprout, place them near a fire shelf or inside one's clothing 2-3 days beforehand to warm them. Within 2-3 days they will all hatch together. Until then, even if some hatch, leave them as they are without concern. Sweep them off with a kite feather. At that time, the early silkworms release thread like smoke. It is also said that when the eggs hatch, sweep the first time, second time, third time. Keep each separately in different straw containers. Thus there are early, middle, and late silkworms.

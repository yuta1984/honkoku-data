　The timing of growth, early or late, can be clearly distinguished. During growth, they sleep and become separated from each other. This is the method in our country. There are also many foreign books such as "Tiangong Kaiwu" or "Jujia Biyong," and particularly "Nongzheng Quanshu" and "Qimin Yaoshu" which contain information about sericulture. One should study them widely and test their essential points for use.

1. Silkworms are creatures of warmth. Therefore, receiving warmth is the primary method of cultivation. A house facing southeast should be designated as the place for silkworm rearing. However, they greatly dislike southern winds. The season good for silkworms is when a person feels comfortable wearing a single lined garment - such weather is also good for silkworms. Therefore, in hot weather, avoid direct sunlight, clean daily, open doors wide for cooling, and in cold weather, place charcoal fires and close the doors. Above all, this understanding is paramount. Considering the seasonal climate is something that cannot be written down without oral transmission.

1. Make containers from straw measuring 3 shaku 2-3 sun across. These are called straw baskets. Silkworms are placed in these containers to be raised. About 28, 29, or 30 of these straw baskets constitute what is called "one batch" of silkworms. This is the approximate number for average-sized production.

1. About ten days after silkworms are born, they enter what is called the "first sleep." During sleep, mulberry is not given. However, since some do not sleep among them, a little mulberry is sprinkled. The quality of the worms can be determined from the second sleep.

1. When silkworms first molt, they dislike climbing to the edges of baskets. Such silkworms are extremely useless, so these silkworms should be quickly discarded and thrown into the river. Silkworms molt four times. About 8-9 days after the fourth molt, they begin spinning thread. When they spin thread, they are placed in something called mountages, which are placed on top of the house. From the first molt, if they do not all molt together, mulberry should not be given until they all molt together.

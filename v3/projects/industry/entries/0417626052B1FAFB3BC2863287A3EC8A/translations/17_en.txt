　are bad, as one should know. As soon as they enter the mabushi, a dark place is good. Place them on top of roof beams for about three nights, and on the fourth day remove the cocoons and dry them in sunlight. If it's rainy, spread them indoors, but it's best to dry them outside every day for five or six days if possible. The proper timing is about three days in clear weather. If over-dried, the silk thread ends won't emerge properly. A slightly moist condition is considered good. When drying, they should be turned over many times. If only the top dries while the bottom remains damp, the thread ends will break. Also, when sudden rain forces you to bring them inside while drying, putting them directly into boxes is bad. One should let them air out a bit to remove moisture before placing them in boxes. For one sheet of silkworm eggs, having a bit over one hundred straw mats of about three shaku square is considered excellent results.

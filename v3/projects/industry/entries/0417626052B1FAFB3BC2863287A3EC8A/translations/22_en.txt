　Stretch it about one shaku, then it shrinks again by one jo two shaku. The same applies to triple-reeled kanren sewing thread.
1. For twill-patterned suspension threads and such, the lower twist should be about 200 turns, and the upper twist should be combined at about 150 turns.
1. The same applies to warp threads set up on brocade looms and such.
1. For spindle weight, both spindle and weight together should be 13 monme 5 bu, or alternatively, the spindle should be about 10 monme and the weight about 3 monme.
1. The pulley cord attached to the wheel is made by aligning twelve cotton threads and applying lower twist. The thickness is that of koto strings.
1. To attach the pulley to the spindle, tie it to the front loop, wind it around completely, then untie and retie. The knot should be a true knot. Start hanging from the front spindle and proceed in order. The tension adjustment of this pulley is extremely important. If too tight, it over-twists; if too loose, the twist doesn't catch. This is oral teaching.

　Oil should be applied to the standing drum. When the pulley cord tension is good, remove it, unwind the thread, undo two or three twists with fingertips, and reconnect. If weak, apply two or three twists. If there is unevenness in this force, unevenness will appear in the thread. Of course, pulley cord stretching and shrinking occurs depending on weather and season. One should pay attention to this.

　　　Gold Thread Twisting Method
1. Authentic gold grade famous items, similarly dark items, medium-fired, and also heavily-fired《Note: These are old foils for weaving gold brocade》
1. Twisted gold measures about three jo five shaku in length per reel using the curved ruler.
1. The upper, middle, and lower grades of foil are determined by the grade of gold. For the upper grade, the thicker the gold application, the better.
1. Fine gold thread refers to extremely finely spun thread.

One: There is something called a hemp-drawing board. It has ups and downs. It is about three sun long and one shaku wide,
　made of bamboo slat. It has a base platform.
One: There is a hemp-drawing razor. It is made in the Kamigata region (Kansai area). An ordinary hair razor will
　suffice. It should be flat. Since the drawing method is long, pull from the center to both sides.
　Place it long to the left, then let it become flat naturally and stack it toward the opposite side,
　tie the roots in one bundle, hang bamboo on a rope, dry it thoroughly with a hanging pole,
　hang it on an ankou and tie it. Of course, tie it with the same hemp.
　One bundle weighs 300 monme, ten bundles combined make 3 kan-me, and with 3 kan-me bundled, four
　bundles making 12 kan-me constitute one load. Reddish-tinged hemp is determined to be top quality.

　Split bamboo, attach thread to the back and front,
　gradually wrap upward in double and triple layers,
　hook feet at the top and tighten.
　The tip becomes thin.

　This is done to prevent rain from hitting it. Cover with straw thatch
　to keep out rain. The next day, loosen again and dry thoroughly. Of course, after drying for five or six
　days until it becomes manageable, do as described above.
One: The hemp spinning method involves moistening the bark-peeled hemp with water, wringing it out
　by hand, tying it to the tip of a bamboo stick two shaku long, and beating it
　on a board veranda. However, when beating, beat so that the hemp extends toward the opposite direction.
　Beat so that it folds and stacks. Dry this, and spin by holding fourteen or fifteen strands
　in the mouth. Join the hemp seams by twisting toward the front.
　If twisted toward the opposite direction, it will unravel when spinning, which is
　bad. Spin and join continuously, folding into the ramie tub.
One: After spinning, wind it on a frame. Then make it into skeins. From this point
　it is extended on the loom.

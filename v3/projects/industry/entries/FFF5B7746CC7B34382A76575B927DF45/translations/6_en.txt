Due to differences in activity and stillness, temperature varies from person to person, and the extreme adjustments are extremely difficult. However, in recent years there is an instrument called a thermometer that measures and determines the heat and cold of day and night, daily. To know before one's eyes from time to time that today is so many degrees colder than yesterday, or that noon is so many degrees warmer than this morning, is beyond human wisdom. If one compares this book with a thermometer and tends to the silkworms without negligence, there is no doubt that a superior crop will be produced, which is invaluable. From around the spring third month of Seimei (Clear and Bright), hang the thermometer on a pillar in one room of the quarters where you take out the silkworm egg papers and begin raising young silkworms, not far from where the eggs are placed. By checking it day and night from time to time, ensuring there is no inconsistency in cold and heat, as taught below, during the period of raising young silkworms, take special care and devote as much effort as nurturing a baby, then there is no doubt that a superior crop will result. Morikuni also said not to imitate neighbors in maintaining the household atmosphere. This is reasonable. For example, if there are now three thermometers placed separately in three different houses,

when divided and hung, one house is a poor small house with many people and also horses, so even a little fire fills the house with smoke, and the sunlight shining in is also strong. Therefore, this house's thermometer reaches a warm temperature of sixty-four or sixty-five degrees early in spring. Since there is no separate place to store the silkworm eggs, they naturally hatch early from the eggs. One house, though it has many people, is a wealthy house with high construction and thick roof. It has many sitting rooms, and the kitchen for making fires is in a separate room. Therefore, this house is cold, and when we look at the thermometer hung during the silkworm larva raising period, it shows fifty-four or fifty-five degrees. Compared to the poor neighboring house, there is a ten-degree difference. The remaining house is in between, showing around sixty degrees. Thus, the hatching of silkworms differs among the three houses. As the teaching goes, each house should learn to maintain its own atmosphere and not imitate neighbors, as also seen in the "Secret Record of Sericulture." This should certainly be trusted. There are two types of the aforementioned thermometers. One type is a glass tube

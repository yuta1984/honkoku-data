This should be done. Always keep the silkworms sparsely fed. If fed thickly, the silkworms will become small and produce small cocoons. When cocoons are small, the silk is thin, the thread opening is weak, and there are few silk threads. Silkworms that have been fed plenty of mulberry leaves will produce large cocoons with many silk threads. {{Side note: Initial stragglers are difficult to catch with cloth nets. Pick them up with chopsticks. From the hawk stage to the boat stage dormancy, quickly separate them with nets.}}

On silkworms disliking wind
On very warm days, open all four directions wide and let in the wind, but ensure that the wind does not directly touch the silkworms. Adjusting the opening and closing of doors according to the thermometer is of primary importance.
Originally, silkworms are shade-loving insects that prefer dark places. When opening doors, arrange it so that where the silkworms are remains dark, and let the wind circulate in from a distance. Especially during young rearing, raising them on wooden floors is very bad. The moisture from the boards affects the silkworms, and mold may develop in their living areas. Lay down mat-like materials instead.

On regulating household temperature
Once the silkworms hatch, always consider the natural climate of your own house, and maintain a temperature suitable for your own seasonal clothing, whether lined or unlined garments. If you feel cold due to north winds, close the doors around. If warm due to south winds, open doors on three sides. If you feel very hot, open all four sides and also open high windows to let in cool breezes. Generally, in all provinces, silkworms hatch around the spring's 88th night, when a little snow still remains on high mountains, and the time when silkworms pupate is around mid-May. The summer weather arrives and people's clothing changes accordingly. Consider this natural climate and養育 the silkworms while keeping good track of your house's temperature. Regulating the cold and warmth inside the house is called "managing the temperature." Also, do not close your doors just because you see others closing theirs. Do not open your doors just because you see others opening theirs. The climate differs from house to house. Simply keep good track of your own house's temperature and

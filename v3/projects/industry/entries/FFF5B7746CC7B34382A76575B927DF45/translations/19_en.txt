This should be kept in mind. Also, being too warm is bad. Prepare ventilation holes in all directions beforehand, make the opening and closing of doors free at this time, and adjusting by checking the thermometer from time to time is most important.
Generally, diseases develop in silkworms and their nature becomes poor due to neglectful care. Not knowing this, many people panic when things suddenly turn bad later. One should understand that future crop failures originate from earlier mistakes. Since temperature conditions differ from house to house, one should think carefully, set up many shelves, and handle them carefully without oversight. Both shelf wood and shelf bamboo should not be green wood. They should be prepared and dried beforehand.
However, {{Note: Replacing the bedding with cloth of one-bu mesh two or three times before molting is even better. At this time, sprinkle bran thinly, apply mulberry twice on the cloth, then open the cloth net}}

On the method of cleaning silkworms using young mulberry buds
Depending on the year, silkworms may emerge before mulberry buds appear, so while one unavoidably feeds mulberry flowers, if leaves are available, leaves should be fed quickly. Silkworms given mulberry leaves

grow much faster. Also, silkworms raised for a long time on mulberry flowers become slightly reddish with poor nature and slow growth.
Initially, remove the leaf veins, chop finely, and sieve through a mesh of one-bu square holes before feeding. The rest should be done as taught before. On the fourth or fifth day after the silkworms are born, scoop up the silkworms along with their bedding using bird feathers, sprinkle ground bran in another well-dried container, spread paper on top, and arrange the silkworms. By raising them this way for six or seven days, they will appear somewhat whitish.
However, {{Note: Feed them evenly on normal days, and on the fourth or fifth day, remove the bedding with cloth net as before. The same should be done when they are about to molt. Separate the slow developers with chopsticks. For those without cloth nets, following the main text is best}}

○There is an oral tradition for this time. Prepare ground bran from early rice of the previous autumn, about five or six bags per sheet of silkworm eggs. Before the silkworms are born, crush this ground bran finely with a mortar, pass it through a rice bran sieve, pass what accumulates below through a water sieve again to remove dust, take what accumulates in the middle, and on the next day before noon, for the silkworms'

Some places initially use millet and barnyard grass bran, but they are light with poor settling, and when crawling up, they roll around making it ineffective. Also, when they cover themselves and perform a lion dance, they are greatly inferior to twice-ground rice bran.

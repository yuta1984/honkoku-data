in glass tubes containing bright white liquid, called mercury (mizukane). The price ranges from one bu and two shu in gold to about two bu. The other type has red liquid in a glass (bidoro) tube, priced at about ten monme in silver. However, both types gradually lose their liquid over time, with the cheaper ones losing more. After three years, there will be a discrepancy of about two to three degrees, which should be kept in mind.

For silkworm use, it is much more beneficial to purchase five cheaper instruments for five households rather than one expensive one. Regarding silkworm breeding books and thermometers, there is an enormous difference in profit and loss between those who begrudge the cost of these two types and don't purchase them, and those who acquire and value them. In recent years, silk thread is expensive. With the price of one to of cocoons, one can purchase both types and still have money left over. They are useful for a long time, so one should definitely acquire them.

When the thermometer reading reaches fifty-eight or fifty-nine degrees (during Kokuu season, mid-third month) in late season, around the eighty-eighth night, silkworms emerge at sixty-five degrees as the center, within four to five degrees before and after.

Every day from the ninth hour to the eighth hour during daytime, when the warm temperature of sixty-four to sixty-five degrees continues for four to five days, silkworms will surely emerge. The Secret Records of Sericulture also states that everywhere it occurs around the eighty-eighth night, but this varies by year depending on whether spring warmth comes early or late. Even if seventy degrees is observed, they won't emerge from just one day of unseasonable warmth. Observers should use their judgment.

One should simply recognize when the natural emergence climate suits one's household temperature and silkworms well, memorize the thermometer reading at that time, and later create and adjust the temperature artificially to match. However, overheating to the point where air becomes stagnant is very harmful.

Morikuni's Secret Records of Sericulture are all significant. Among these, the adjustment of household temperature, feeding techniques, and care practices are most essential. While techniques can be learned easily from books when followed properly, and daily work practices are even easier, what is beyond human control is the household temperature.

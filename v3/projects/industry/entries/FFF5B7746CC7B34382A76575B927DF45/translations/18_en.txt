When hatched silkworms are carried over to the next day for sweeping, it is said that no matter how much skill one applies in raising them, they will develop abnormalities from their initial state. In any case, silkworms should be swept and collected on the same day they hatch. Also, if you sweep silkworms with a feather brush, the emerging silkworms will be slightly injured. With this in mind, even silkworms still attached to the seed paper should be gently swept into containers with a feather brush. Sprinkle mulberry with good moderation, spread it slowly in all directions, and make it thin. At this time, silkworms from one seed paper should be spread thinly and evenly over about three shaku square. Use many different containers so that silkworms do not rub against each other. If using funabe (mulberry catkins) on the first day, feed them three or four times a day; if using cut mulberry leaves, feed them four or five times a day. This should also be adjusted slightly according to fair or rainy weather. Then place them in a somewhat warm location. Set up shelving in about three locations - on cold days place them in warm spots, on days with strong humidity place them in slightly cool spots, and adjust according to the thermometer. If mulberry leaves are available, feed the leaves as soon as possible.

Mulberry sieves should match the silkworms, using coarser mesh later on. There are various methods in different regions, and each should follow what works best for them. From then on, twice a day use thin-pointed chopsticks to spread out the silkworm bedding. This is a closely guarded secret of shishi-mae care, a method to dry the silkworms' resting places and prevent mold formation. Every day before giving mulberry, use chopsticks to distribute silkworms from thick areas to thin areas, then sprinkle mulberry evenly and feed them. If rainy weather continues and the silkworm bedding becomes damp, sprinkle coarse rice bran little by little over the silkworms, then immediately feed them mulberry. This is also to dry the silkworm bedding. For the four to five days after silkworms emerge, temperature control is especially crucial. If care is poor during the seven to eight days from this point, various diseases will develop later. One must take the utmost care. Also, during young silkworm rearing, if north winds come, the silkworms will not eat mulberry at all, and the silkworms may disappear and die.

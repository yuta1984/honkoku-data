Silkworms are raised in baskets during the pre-ioki period called "shishi," then transferred to this platform. It is used primarily during the "takafune" period and also until the "niwaoki" period. Since the usage period is long, the feet should be made about two widths of the vertical frame as shown in the diagram. When stacking multiple units, having wide feet at the bottom ensures they won't be stepped on incorrectly even when handled by touch, making handling faster. Both the tenons of the feet and the holes in the platform should be made to fit together properly, allowing for removal and storage.

Things to be careful about with silkworms

In a certain village, someone placed silkworms above and lit a fire below, causing great damage in just one hour. This should be kept in mind. Long ago, a farmer was sowing rice seeds in a seedbed when a friend came to visit. They rested together on the rice field ridge, but unexpectedly got into a long conversation and stayed until past noon before parting. He then sowed the remaining rice seeds before returning home. The seeds sown in the morning sprouted well, but those sown in the afternoon sprouted very poorly. This happened because in the third month, rice seeds are soaked in water, then the seedbed is prepared, and the seeds are removed from water and dried to the proper degree, at which point all the rice seeds sprout. They should be sown in the field without delay at this time, but because the sprouted rice seeds were left on the field ridge and exposed to the sun, all the young sprouts were damaged, resulting in a poor harvest that year. How much more so with silkworms, which are insects with their own nature that feed - even a short time can bring changes.

Open up around and let air in. At this time, when the thermometer reads 64-65 degrees, soon two or three insects will begin to emerge. Still wrap them in pulled cotton to keep them warm, and when you keep the sliding doors and cedar doors tightly closed, the warmth will fill, and if you do this for 2-3 days, they will all hatch together. Once they have hatched, for about 10 days, it is essential to carefully open and close the sliding doors so as to keep them in warm weather of 64-65 degrees. If it becomes stuffy from warm wind, open the sliding doors. If it becomes cold from midnight, do not open the sliding doors early the next morning, as they are susceptible to the morning cold air. It is very bad to try to force hatching by putting them in one's bosom, wrapping them in nightwear or bedding, or placing them near fire to quickly warm the eggs just because the neighbor's silkworms have hatched. Let nature take its course.

Method of using mulberry flowers (jin) to brush off silkworms initially

【Left Page】
Although it is determined that silkworms should be raised with mulberry leaves from the beginning, in cold regions during the season when spring silkworms emerge, there are years when mulberry buds have not yet sprouted. At such times, there are places where mulberry flowers are unavoidably picked and fed to silkworms. Jin refers to mulberry fruit that becomes seeds. What silkworms eat should be understood as mulberry's sterile flowers. When initially brushing them off, wash your hands well, take those mulberry flowers that have no dew and are well dried, rub them with your hands to make them somewhat fine, sift them well, and also remove debris with a winnowing basket.

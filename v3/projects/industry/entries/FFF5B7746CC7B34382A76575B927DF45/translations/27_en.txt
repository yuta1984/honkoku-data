Proper adjustment is essential, as can be seen in silkworm cultivation books. At this time, from the young silkworm rearing period, hang a thermometer nearby and check it many times day and night - then there will be no arguments in the household.
For example, one person works hard, moving their body and becomes hot from fatigue. Another person sits quietly and feels cold. A neighbor comes and says it's cool. The three differ and there is no consistency. There are many arguments morning and evening, but silkworms are easily affected by brief periods of cold or heat. Simply remember the thermometer reading when the silkworms are first born, adjust so it's not the same daily, and later having the temperature rise gradually once every three days is the natural way of climate. For unexpected cold at dawn, quickly light a fire. For gradual warming, use charcoal fire to warm, and when hot, open doors to cool. Keeping it moderate day and night without excess or deficiency is the most important care for silkworms, especially during young rearing.

On caring for the hawk stage molting {{Side note: This is the second molting. At this time, maintain around seventy degrees as the standard}}
Even until the silkworms reach the hawk stage molting, change their bedding every two days. For mulberry preparation, use kitchen knives,押切, and similar tools

to cut according to the silkworms' size, cutting somewhat coarsely, then sift this through a screen of about five-bu square, remove dust and debris with a winnowing basket, and sprinkle evenly without unevenness for feeding. In rainy weather, mold may develop in their living area. At such times, sprinkle coarse rice bran lightly over the silkworms, then feed mulberry leaves. The living area will dry and they will eat the mulberry well. During this hawk stage molting, the "責桑" period also occurs, and when silkworms float up to the surface, stop sprinkling mulberry as before and cover with nets to align the silkworms, as seen in certain books. However, when 責桑 is more than half done but not a single silkworm has yet floated up, sprinkle rice bran thinly as taught before, cover with nets, and arrange so that the mulberry leaves that remained on the sifting screen all stay on top of the net - then all young silkworms will attach to the mulberry and align wonderfully. Do likewise for all four moltings. Houses without nets should use straw cores as markers and follow the previous instructions. When silkworms wake up, especially select soft, moist mulberry leaves for feeding. This is because they temporarily abstain from food

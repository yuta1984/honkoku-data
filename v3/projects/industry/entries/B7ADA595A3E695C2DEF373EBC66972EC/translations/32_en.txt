　　[Note] In Chichibu of Musashi Province, it is said that this year's silkworm metamorphosis was twenty days later than in Shimamura. It is thought that Shinshū Province probably has a similar degree of variation. However, when artificial heat is employed, this example does not apply.

　　　Chapter Three
The egg seeds develop a blue color and metamorphose in approximately ten days. When first removing them from boxes and hanging them in a quiet room, if the seed papers are hung in order, then reversed the next day, and this is done daily without neglect, there will be no significant delays or advances.

The temperature for exposing egg seed papers to the atmosphere to promote metamorphosis is not yet precisely known (it is probably around fifty degrees). The temperature from catalytic blueing to metamorphosis is appropriately sixty degrees or higher, with sixty-seven to sixty-eight degrees being optimal.

　　[Note] This temperature is recorded based on this year's actual experiments. This year's silkworm metamorphosis occurred on March 17th at a temperature of fifty-six degrees. Local people said the weather was quite cold.

　　Local customs focus solely on calendar seasons and do not use thermometers. When the egg seed papers were removed, it was before the selector had come to this area, so the exact temperature could not be determined in detail. However, from this year onward, instruments have been acquired to measure temperature, cold, clear weather, and rain.

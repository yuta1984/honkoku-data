While it goes without saying that leaves soiled with mud and dust or wetted by rain are harmful to silkworms, during periods of continuous rain, one cannot avoid

Also, when silkworms have matured and the summer heat is severe, dew-covered mulberry leaves are sometimes necessarily given. It is essential to make every effort to remove them from the silkworm beds.

　　However, four-tenths of these are already lost during the rearing process. If it is middle or lower grade sericulture, one should know that the losses are even more severe. Now, if those who raise silkworms understand the total amount that should multiply and the approximate number of losses, they will surely be careful in their measures and think to prevent this.

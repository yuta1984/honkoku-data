The causes of silkworm diseases arise from cold, heat, rain, and humidity, with inappropriate feed and putrefaction toxins being the most common causes of outbreak. From the time silkworms hatch until the second molt, they are at their smallest and most fragile, so even with careful and loving care, many are consumed, lost, and damaged during daily handling or each time the silkworm beds are changed. When calculating the number of eggs per paper, by the time of final completion, nearly one-third is reduced. Considering this, if the whole is divided into three parts: one part dies young, one part that was injured grows through the power of careful nurturing, and one part

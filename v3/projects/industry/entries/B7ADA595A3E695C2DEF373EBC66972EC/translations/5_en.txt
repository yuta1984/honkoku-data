　　omit this and leave it to future consideration.
1. Previous books on sericulture are so numerous they would make oxen sweat 
   and fill up entire buildings, but most of these books were written by 
   practitioners boastfully exaggerating their own sericulture methods. 
   Moreover, when compiling them, they relied solely on imagination and 
   speculation, and in extreme cases, became so fixated on words and phrases 
   that they lost sight of the facts. For this reason, with claims that A is 
   correct and B is wrong, arguments are confused and chaotic, and no definitive 
   reliable theory has yet been established. Therefore, this book sweeps away 
   all previous theories, discards them entirely, goes directly to the actual 
   sites of sericulture, observes closely and carefully examines, experiments 
   with the practice, and expounds its mysteries. It should truly exhaust the 
   principles of sericulture to discover its secrets, and thereby provide 
   sufficient basis for

1. The prosperity of sericulture in our country has increased most remarkably 
   in recent times, with the industry now established throughout the nation. 
   Compared to twenty years ago, it has increased by approximately three-fifths. 
   However, the famous production areas are still limited to just a few locations: 
   Iwashiro (Date and Shinobu counties), Uzen (Yonezawa), Shinano (Ueda), 
   and Kōzuke (Shimamura). This is presumably due to the suitability of the 
   land and the diligence of the people. The reason this book draws its material 
   from Kōzuke (Shimamura) is because it has the most innovative and sophisticated 
   principles in seed production methods. The details will be explained in the 
   main text, so I will not repeat them here.

caring and nurturing should naturally be the first priority, but from hatching until around the first sleep period, they are particularly young and fragile, so the utmost attention is required.

　　[Note] When the thermometer reads sixty-five degrees during the silkworm egg hatching period, the sweeping down should be completed in three days. This is considered the normal appropriate condition. There are always variations in speed depending on temperature. This year, initial hatching occurred on March 17th at fifty-six degrees, and concluded on the 21st at fifty-eight degrees.

Although there are significant timing differences during the first sleep, there are natural temperature variations between north-south and upper-lower areas within the silkworm room.

Seven to eight days after sweeping down, when the silkworm bodies turn white and two or three heads per curved shaku tsubo are observed to be about to enter sleep the next morning, rice hulls are sprinkled evenly, and nets are layered little by little on top (nets are used because during the juvenile stage, they are not only difficult to pick up by hand, but also because we fear injuring them). Four nets are placed over one basket, and chopped mulberry leaves are fed on top.

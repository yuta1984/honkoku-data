To carefully select cocoons, choose those that are round and smooth. When rotated by hand, they should produce silk threads easily. White ones should be increasingly white, and yellow ones should be increasingly yellow, with natural brilliance - these are the finest cocoons. Such cocoons produce the best eggs when used for breeding and also yield superior silk when processed into thread.

Generally, those raised with utmost care should have approximately 270 to 300 cocoons per masu (traditional unit of measure) to be considered superior quality. Cocoons that vary greatly in size, lack luster, and number 350 or even 370 to 380 per masu are of the lowest grade, and when processed into silk

are still not of fine quality. How much more so when it comes to egg production. If one attempts to produce eggs using such inferior cocoons, it can be said that one invites disaster upon oneself.

Pre-examine cocoons from which moths are about to emerge, and cover them with paper. Around 7-8 o'clock in the morning, the emerged moths will crawl up onto the paper, and when male and female mate, take them as they are on another paper, place them in a basket lined with matting, and leave them quietly. Around 2 o'clock in the afternoon, release the male moth and retain only the female moth. If you move the paper slightly, it will certainly urinate.

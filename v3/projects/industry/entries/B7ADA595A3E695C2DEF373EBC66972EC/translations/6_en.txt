1. In sericulture, there is a distinction between seed production and silk reeling, 
   and their methods inevitably differ somewhat. However, the main purpose of 
   seed production is fundamentally to achieve excellence in the original silkworm 
   eggs, and the essence lies in silk reeling. Originally, the purpose of silkworms 
   is to manifest their wonderful efficacy when made into silk thread and silk

   to this. However, the reason this book is detailed about seed production 
   and brief about silk reeling is that it describes them according to the

   should be able to achieve equal appropriateness in both seed production

   the procedures for mulberry cultivation before proceeding to sericulture 
   contains, I believe, a profound meaning. Readers should understand this.
1. The methods of raising silkworms as well as the installation of buildings 
   and construction of equipment cannot help but have small differences according 
   to the local climate and customs. Now this book details the things used in 
   Kōzuke (Shimamura), while also briefly recording the methods and tools of 
   other provinces, in order to show the similarities and differences of each place.

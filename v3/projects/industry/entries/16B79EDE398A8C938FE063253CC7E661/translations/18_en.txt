grows luxuriantly and becomes thick, with leaves that are round, wide, and thick. The leaf serrations are few and it bears little fruit. Chinese books call this "rosō" (Lu mulberry) and record it as the superior type of mulberry. The other type appears slender and hard from trunk to branches, with deep leaf serrations like chrysanthemum leaves. It bears many mulberries (mulberry fruits) but the tree form is not abundant. This is called "keisō" (Jing mulberry). Lu mulberry produces much silk when fed to silkworms, while Jing mulberry has thin, hard leaves so its yield is inferior, but the silk is strong. Lu mulberry has soft wood so it does not last long. Jing mulberry is hard from trunk to branches and leaves, so it thrives long and is strong. Therefore, Chinese books record that it is good to use Jing mulberry as the large tree stock and graft Lu mulberry onto it. This would certainly make sense, but mulberry grows easily and is easy to cultivate, so there is no need for grafting, cutting, or layering. One should sow good seeds every year, raise many seedlings, and plant them as replacements for old trees.

○Raising seedlings
When mulberries (mulberry fruits) ripen black, pick them and crush them as is, wash with water and dry. Cultivate the seedbed as finely as possible, spread as much fertilizer as possible and level it, make ridges, and draw furrows across as when planting vegetables. Sow the seeds mixed with silkworm droppings and other fertilizer, soil, and ash, spreading thinly and evenly, then cover with soil as thinly as possible. If there is no moisture, one should tread it down a little. If there is drought, pour water; if weeds appear, pull them out; thin out densely grown areas, and afterwards frequently apply liquid fertilizer to raise them. If it is a place with severe cold weather, use cattle and horse manure

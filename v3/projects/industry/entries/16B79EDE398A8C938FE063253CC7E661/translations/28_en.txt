Tea and cocoon silk are lightweight yet valuable commodities, so even when shipping them long distances from the eastern provinces to the western provinces, when calculated as a proportion of their monetary value, they can be delivered for minimal transport costs.

On the Method of Taking Cuttings
In my household, for over forty years I have been propagating mulberry saplings through cuttings, giving them annually to those who earnestly request them, and also planting them widely myself for experimentation. I have observed that while cuttings taken from shoots of old trees initially flourish rapidly and quickly serve their purpose, their prime period does not exceed twenty years. This naturally depends on the location and planting method. First, regarding the method of taking cuttings: if there are superior varieties of Lu mulberry or thorny mulberry in the vicinity, one should seek them out and dig up trees that are at their cutting prime, around ten years old.

After transplanting, the part that resembles a turban shell where it has been cut annually with a sickle becomes the "head," and the large branch portions are cut away. Note: {{Large branches refer to the annual shoots | The young buds that emerge from these the following year}} {{are fed to silkworms | Old wood is called "mulberry hands" and | becomes firewood}} Dig deeply in thick-soiled fields, plant the mulberry head level with the ground surface, add an appropriate amount of rotted refuse or whatever can serve as fertilizer, cover with soil, and tamp down firmly to serve as the stock tree. If planted around October, protect from frost during that winter, also dig around the roots and pour in an appropriate amount of liquid manure and bury it. At the end of January of the following year, cut away all the old branches without exception, and after the spring equinox in February, vigorous young shoots will emerge. By around May of that same year, these will have grown to over two feet in length. However, {{good saplings cannot be obtained in the first year}} Around the stock tree in a circle, to a depth of one foot

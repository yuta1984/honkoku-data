This should serve as future assistance. It brings many benefits. When cutting large amounts of mulberry in a hurry during rainy weather or at dusk, there will inevitably be some left uncut, and if left behind, it will interfere with later bud sprouting, causing poor growth and becoming the basis for mulberry shortages the following year. Therefore, the initial mulberry gathering should follow the principles of mulberry picking, and later, small sickles should be used to cut as close as possible to the old wood. Bundle and bring in - this is mulberry cutting. However, "During summer and autumn, each tree should be tended in the same manner. This is for raising summer silkworms."

Regarding cloth nets used for changing locations during silkworm larval rearing:
The usage method was recorded in the previous volume. Use good cotton with 30-40 mesh count, though "for single-thread weaving, about 20 mesh counts will suffice." Use medium-thick thread without uneven spots, well-boiled and without sizing.

Open the reed properly to create square openings of 1 to 1.5 bu using whale-bone measurement, weaving on a loom one shaku wide and three jō long. Insert two dark blue sewing threads at each end to form selvages. For the initial preparation, tie threads together in pairs, leaving 2-3 sun extra at the front, inserting thin bamboo or wood pieces for the initial weaving tension and sizing force. The finishing should be done similarly. Cut bamboo to 1 shaku 2 bu in length, split to 2.5 bu width, and shape both ends into 1-bu arrow-notch shapes to make shiishi (bamboo supports). Prepare several hundred, 50-60 pieces, inserting one every 2-3 sun while weaving and rolling forward. Attach the bark side of bamboo to the cloth, and for the shiishi claws, the right side hooks the front claw to the selvage, while the other side faces away.

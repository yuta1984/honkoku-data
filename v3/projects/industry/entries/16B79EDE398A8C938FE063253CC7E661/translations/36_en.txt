Trees grown to maturity through layering develop large holes in their heartwood, quickly showing signs of decay, and do not become large trees. Particularly with mulberry trees, since all branches and leaves are cut away every summer, they tire quickly. It is essential to ensure from the beginning that small seedlings are truly free from disease. The troubles of later years begin earlier - this warning about sericulture is found in various books and should be understood. The method for planting layered seedlings in upland fields to maintain and prosper them for a long time involves digging holes as deep and wide as possible, placing the seedlings, and adding fertilizer as described before. Branch cutting should also follow the morning glory method as before. However, in that year, fill the hole only partially, then in the spring of the second year, add fallen leaves and such, completely filling it over two years. Initially, make it five to six inches lower than the flat ground, burying the old wood from before in the soil and replacing it with new wood. The reason for completely filling in the second year is to prevent surface roots from emerging. Surface roots interfere with cultivation, and when the mulberry roots are cut, they do not prosper. Roots that run horizontally along the bottom absorb the leaked and settled manure liquid from cultivation, benefiting both crops.

However, while there is a tradition that the ancients considered planting three mulberry trees per day as one person's work, such practices are not popular in modern times. The rest follows the morning glory method mentioned before. Also, if all trees have their branches and leaves cut off before planting, they take root easily and prosper well. For seedlings grown from seeds, use this method for upland areas, while for riverside areas, planting them directly works well and serves the purpose quickly. For planting once in upland fields to prosper long-term, it should be limited to transplanting seedlings grown from seeds according to the old methods. Harvest in the fourth year after planting to feed the silkworms.

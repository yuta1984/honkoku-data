grow one plant each, and when the millet bears fruit and the ears are harvested, afterwards cut and dry the stalks, set fire to them, and burn from the windward side. Then in spring the mulberries will grow and flourish, and that year they can be fed to silkworms early. ○Also, it is said that around house grounds and other flat, soft places, both Lu mulberry and Jing mulberry are all good. However, if it is a high hill or mountain field with strong, hard soil or windy places, Jing mulberry should be planted. ○Also, sow hemp on the southwest ridges, and sow mulberry seeds mixed with millet seeds on the northeast ridges. If there is drought and the ground becomes dry, make shade coverings and build shelves to pour water. This should also be cut down together with the millet and burned in a favorable wind. Afterwards, use manure ash for maintenance, and in spring when they flourish, transplanting them is also good.

Using seeds for planting and letting them grow naturally is fundamentally good. Grafting, layering, and cutting are all good methods. Among these, placing feet on lower branches close to the roots, cultivating with manure, doing layering, and when good roots emerge, cutting and transplanting is remarkably quick. ○There is also a method for making ground mulberry. High trees are not convenient for picking leaves. Moreover, high trees alone are sometimes insufficient, and in places where silkworm profits are excellent and there is surplus land, this should be made exclusively. Like planting Yoshino lacquer in fields, space them four to five shaku apart, dig holes for two to three mulberry seedlings per spot, put in manure and plant. When they grow thick, leave about one shaku from ground level, cut with a saw, scrape the cut surface, apply pine resin, and with fire

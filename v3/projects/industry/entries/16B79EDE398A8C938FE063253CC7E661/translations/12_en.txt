《Marginal notes: For long-lasting usefulness, beat and soften the straw for sugai well before bundling. Length: five shaku. ○ Store two per shelf and use every year》

《Marginal notes: This shape like a drum, used crosswise with mats, becomes a pillow for crossbeam bamboo. Two per shelf, also used every year》

《Marginal notes: Length three shaku》　《Marginal notes: Bow-shaped mulberry branches, use five or six per shelf. These are mulberry branches from the previous year. These are forbidden items. Well-dried and light ones are good. These are also used every year》

《Marginal notes: Mat length six shaku, wrapped straw length five shaku》

《Marginal notes: Mulberry branches length three shaku, mat width three shaku length six shaku. Crossbeam bamboo length six shaku, cross pillow length one shaku, long pillow five shaku. It is good to have some scattered hanging debris in the center area, but too much is bad》

《Marginal notes: It is good for pillows not to reach the four corners. At the corners, without bedding areas, it is better to attach vegetable stalks and straw directly to the mat. Silkworms that crawl to the edges climb well. As shown in the diagram, erect on the mat, and place straw, vegetable stalks, or any materials in a crisscross pattern as taught before》

The above method is used for quick accommodation when hanging spinning frames on platforms or when hanging over areas with bedding.

Regarding Standing Spinning Frames

○ There is what is called straw standing spinning frames. To use these, first remove tatami mats from lower rooms, storage rooms, or second floors if they have them, creating a raised wooden floor space. Spread reed mats on this, then lay bamboo mats on top. Spread the fourth-molted silkworms across this entire area, and throw mulberry leaves around the perimeter

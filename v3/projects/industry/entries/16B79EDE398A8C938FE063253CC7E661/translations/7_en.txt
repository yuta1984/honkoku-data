On Raising Silkworms and Setting Up Cocoon Frames (Mabushi)

What was omitted from the previous volume shall be recorded in this volume. When silkworms stop eating mulberry leaves, this is called either "tobikiru" or "sugaku." Preparing the place where cocoons are made is called either "hanging the cocoon frames" or "yatohi." There are many different methods according to different people's practices. I shall record the general outline.

On the platform shown in the illustration of the previous volume, lay down straw mats, arrange two or three branches of brushwood on top, and on these place vegetable stalks, straw, and similar materials in a crisscross pattern of eight or ten layers, lightly arranged so that there are gaps with just the right spacing, neither too much nor too little. Into this, place the silkworms, estimating that there will be about three sho or more of silkworms that will form cocoons. However, silkworms that have begun cocooning are easily damaged. Handle them gently. Arrange so that cocoons can be seen forming uniformly throughout the cocoon frame.

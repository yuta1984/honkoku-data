Extend one shoot that emerges from the cut opening and remove the rest. Around May of that year, pinch off the tips of the young shoots and leave them. From the many young shoots that emerge, keep three and remove the lower buds as when growing chrysanthemums. During June and July, pinch off the tips of the three young shoots again. Following this method, bury good fertilizer together with the roots of good seedlings and plant them. With the same care as growing chrysanthemums, if tending is thorough, it will become a morning glory-like tree within the year. In that case, from the spring of the second year, you can cut with a sickle from the tips of the nine branches. Usually, even if it doesn't develop in one year, it will certainly develop in two years. Those that take three years to develop are from neglectful planting methods, where only the tips of suckers are broken off once in spring each year and lower branches are removed once in summer. The morning glory cultivation method allows many leaves to be harvested from one trunk.

This is also a method for long-term prosperity. Weeding around the roots is also good.
When planting mulberry in fields where weeds grow easily, if many branches emerge from the soil, they will become entangled with grass roots, making weeding difficult. Later, the mulberry will weaken, various diseases will appear on the leaves, and this is poisonous to silkworms. Those living near rivers prioritize planting good seedlings to feed silkworms from the following year. Those who wish to maintain mulberry trees in prosperity for a long time must transplant seedlings grown from seeds. With layered propagation, when cutting from the parent tree, damage from the wound causes decay to rise into the heartwood of the tree, gradually causing the core to rot. Afterward, only the surrounding bark remains, neither dying completely nor serving its purpose, becoming merely an obstacle to cultivation. In general, layering and cutting propagation are like cutting propagation of pears, persimmons, and cypress trees...

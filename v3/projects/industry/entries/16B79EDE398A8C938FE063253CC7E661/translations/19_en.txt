Also, cover with rice bran and transplant in the first or second month of the following year. ○Also, take mulberry fruits and rub them onto rope as is, cut the rope to match the width of the gangi (field ridges), plant, cover with soil and tread down firmly - they will grow well this way too. ○Slightly rotted rope is good. ○Regarding the land for transplanting: When planting in fields, space them four to five shaku apart planting one at a time, or planting two to three in one place also makes picking easier and faster. Make the rows straight according to the field's structure, with two or three wheat ridges between rows, depending on the land and the person's convenience. Besides this, they thrive well in ridges, embankments, and riverside areas close to water. Particularly, it is convenient for watering. After they take root, dig around them, scrape away weeds, and bury them around the roots. Sow mung beans, azuki beans, etc. Do not pick leaves for two years, leave them as is, and begin harvesting after about three years. However, this depends on the fertility of the soil. For those that are well-fertilized and thriving, you may begin picking from the following year. ○Method for planting mulberries (mulberry fruits): Take those that are black and well-ripened, dry them, cut off both ends and use the middle portion as seed - these will become trees that thrive and grow thick. Moisten and rub together tree ash and seeds, wash with water the next day, remove floating chaff and other debris, dry in the sun, and plant - they will grow easily. ○Also, in a barren field that has been plowed and cultivated with manure spread and leveled, sow millet seeds and mulberries (mulberry fruits) in equal parts, cover the seeds thinly with sand, and after they sprout, occasionally cultivate and remove weeds. When mulberry seedlings have grown two to three sun (inches)

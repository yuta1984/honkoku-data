should be cut off, and fertilizer as before should be added. This time, space them about three feet apart, with plantings arranged five to six sun or seven to eight sun apart, with one tree each, transplanting to nursery ground of about one hundred tsubo or more. Of course, this quantity should depend on how many seedlings there are. If there is drought, water should be given. Top-dressing fertilizer should also be applied as judged necessary to supplement insufficient buried fertilizer. Now, from the second year onward, for trees that have grown thick, many small branches will emerge from the soil level - these should be gently scratched off with fingernails while still young buds from where the leaves attach, as if cultivating chrysanthemums. When transplanting to fields and planting deep, having lower branches is bad. However, if too dense in the nursery, they become branchless and thin like hemp, stretching tall and becoming wobbly, which is bad. In general, seedlings that are thick at the base, tapered at the top, short in height, stocky and prosperously formed will flourish well and become large trees.

○ Also, from before the spring equinox of the third year, do as above with field furrows four feet wide, planting one tree per foot in the rows. The nursery ground should be cleared from the previous winter. It is best to sow in cleared land from the first year. With each transplanting, long roots should be cut. In the spring of the fourth year, dig them all up at once and move them to their respective permanent locations. Particularly, transplanting in the spring of the third year produces many good seedlings. ○ However, for seedlings to be transplanted to shallow ground like stone riverbanks or grassy plains, if sown thinly in the first year with good care, they should be planted from ten days before the spring equinox of the following second year. Small seedlings stay low to the ground surface and are warm, so compared to large trees they are

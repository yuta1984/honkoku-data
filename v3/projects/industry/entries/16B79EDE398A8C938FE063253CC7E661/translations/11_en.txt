Place straw as pillows on all four sides, and across the top, pass one straight, thin bamboo pole through the center lengthwise. Arrange six or seven pieces cut to three shaku in length, slightly curved like thin mulberry branch bows, crossing perpendicularly with this bamboo. Layer beaten straw from vegetable stalks and such in a crisscross pattern, creating gaps like fish scales, neither too much nor too little. Having some hanging materials scattered slightly below the central crossbeam allows silkworms in the middle passage to climb up to the spinning frames early. At this time, if you see silkworms that are slightly behind in feeding, add finely cut mulberry leaves to accommodate them. This is called "accommodating mulberry."

○ This same technique applies when accommodating on platforms. Placing pillows on all four sides, crossing bamboo poles, and using mulberry branches prevents silkworms from making cocoons while still on their bedding. Cocoons attached to bedding are called "steamed" and become useless, suitable neither for silk nor cotton. Even if only slightly attached, those portions cannot be made into silk. ○ Also, if you give branched mulberry to silkworms before they climb, they will make cocoons between the branches. These also cannot be made into silk.

The method of preparing pillows: select straw and bundle it like wrapping eggs, making it about as thick as the circumference of a tea cup and five shaku long, with two per shelf. For crosswise pillows, wrap used mats to about the thickness of a large rice bowl. Cut the mat width into thirds. Both bamboo and mulberry branches are better when old. Store all pillows away and use them every year.

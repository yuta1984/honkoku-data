This makes for good income, and for farming households in mountainous areas or remote countryside to build up their wealth, it is best to plant mulberry trees and engage in sericulture. For land to plant mulberry trees, even poor rice fields will work wonderfully with proper care if there is four to five sun (about 12-15 cm) of soil depth. Although the soil quality may be inferior, nothing surpasses having deep earth. Occasionally digging deep ditches and burying fallen leaves and compost will make the land better the thicker it is.

The amount of mulberry that silkworms eat is the same between what they consume from the first day until two days after the fourth molting period (niwaki), and what they eat during the final five to six days until they mature. For example, with mulberry from one tan-bu of field, during the thirty days from the fourth molting until the second day, they eat five se-bu worth of mulberry, and during the final five days, they eat another five se-bu of mulberry. However, the limit is thirty-five days from when the silkworms are cleaned out until they stop eating mulberry and make cocoons.

Now, silkworm diseases should be recognizable from the beginning, but they are not visible without considerable skill. After the fourth molting, anyone can tell. One should wash hands every time before touching the silkworms. Those who initially chop up young mulberry buds should be even more thoroughly clean. Hands have salt, oil, and impurities. Since they are also called "insects of the gods," one should hang sacred ropes (shimenawa) in the house when raising them.

Also, mulberry leaves with dirt and sand attached are bad. One should spread an old straw mat in the field and bundle them on top of it. Also, do not place mulberry where there are many ants. Since they bite the silkworms, find them quickly and pinch them to death. Also, if you fan them with a fan, they will immediately leave.

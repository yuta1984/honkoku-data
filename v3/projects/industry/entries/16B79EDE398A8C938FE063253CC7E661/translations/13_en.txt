If using a large room for feeding, place crossbeams in the middle - for a three-ken span, use pine boards three ken long, about five to six sun wide and two sun thick. Place square supporting blocks near the pillars, lay the boards across them to create about two bridge-like structures for a three-ken room, making them high enough to leave five to six sun of space above the silkworms. Place silkworms on the entire surface under the bridges as well. During the period until they climb up, remove the bedding waste about three times per cycle. At this time, lift one mat's worth from the corner of the room onto a platform, roll out the remaining waste along with the mats, replace with separately dried mats, transfer the next batch of silkworms in order, and replace with dried mats one by one. Place the silkworms initially lifted onto the platform in the final empty space. Since they climb up around the seventh day, position yourself in front where the handling differs.

After removing and discarding the waste and feeding cut mulberry leaves, when you think it's time to let them climb up, still give finely cut accommodation mulberry to late-feeding silkworms as needed, then place bundled straw inverted and upright above them. Prepare many large and small bundles, placing two or three on each mat. Also place small ones in the gaps between. The method of preparing standing frames is as shown in the left diagram: take long, good-quality straw, cut off a little from the base end, thoroughly strip away the sheaths, align the bases, make thick straw ties for bundling. Attach short straw around the outside in seven to eight sun stepped layers from the base end, tie the tip end with rope in a double bind, bundle one straight mulberry branch into the center for reinforcement.

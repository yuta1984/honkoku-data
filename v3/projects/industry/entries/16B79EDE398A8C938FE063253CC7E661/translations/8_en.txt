Distribute the insects properly. While it is acceptable to put in a small number of silkworms, when producing in large quantities, one faces difficulties with space and tends to put in too many, stacking them up. Also, when only cocooning worms are picked up one by one, there is no need to place branches, but when many silkworms are put in together, ensure they do not become steamed. When silkworm urine gets on previously formed cocoons and changes their color, these are called "steamed cocoons" and cannot be made into silk thread. Medium cocoons number about three hundred per sho. Use this proportion when placing them. Keep about three hundred in darkness for lodging. From the fourth day, open them up and let in plenty of air. Around the fifth day, gently lift and remove the straw mats. On the sixth and seventh days, quickly remove the cocoons one by one from the cocoon frames. This is called "cocoon picking." Immediately on the aforementioned

empty platform, lay straw mats, spread oil paper on top, and on this arrange about one sho at a time, pressing them flat with the palm of the hand, and dry them in the sun. On the eighth and ninth days, small round holes will be eaten through here and there, and insects called "maggots" will emerge from within. The silk thread is cut at these holes and cannot be used as high-quality silk. There are oral traditions regarding the drying method. Cover the arranged cocoons with oil paper again and place weight stones at the four corners. When drying, white cocoons dry to a pure white, and yellow cocoons maintain exactly their original golden yellow color from when they were fresh cocoons, with no color change at all. They dry well with a lustrous wet-like appearance, and the silk quality is excellent. Merchants also pay particularly high prices for these. This method provides better sun exposure and faster drying than drying under direct sunlight, which is remarkable. Also, early-ripening silkworms must be lodged on platforms.

The remaining two portions should be placed in earthen storehouses, underground cellars, or under floorboards in boxes, kept in cold places. Ten days before the 88th night, take out one sheet of seeds and place it in a warm location. This portion will hatch around the 95th night. The remaining one sheet should be taken out on the 88th night and placed in a warm location. It will hatch around the 103rd night. Each is arranged to hatch with seven to eight days intervals. Thus, the four sleeps and four risings will all properly be spaced seven to eight days apart. Therefore, after the first batch becomes cocoons and is completely harvested from the shelves, the ninety-

These are also raised on the same shelf. As described above, with seven to eight day intervals, cocoons are produced three times, so for both nurturing and raising, it is greatly beneficial not to do everything at once. Those who have previously raised silkworms on one shelf and harvested one bale of cocoons, if they follow this three-harvest method, can achieve a three-fold increase and harvest three bales of cocoons through this raising method.

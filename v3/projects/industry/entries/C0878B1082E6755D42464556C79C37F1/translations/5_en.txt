This work is indeed a task that women should undertake. Because of this, my intention to promote sericulture has deepened, and previously I compiled the "Sericulture Standards" describing its details. Now again, with simplicity as the main principle, I have selected and compiled this "Sericulture Essentials." I wish that if sericulture practices flourish, it will bring happiness to the nation.

　○Method of "One Shelf, Three Harvests" (hitotana sanben-dori)
Prepare two sets of silkworm shelves 《marginal note: One shelf is needed for the gathering shelf. One shelf is prepared for staggered timing》. Prepare seeds for three shelves worth of raising. Around the first Horse day, cut the seed paper into three parts, and handle one portion in the usual manner. This portion will hatch around the 88th night as usual.

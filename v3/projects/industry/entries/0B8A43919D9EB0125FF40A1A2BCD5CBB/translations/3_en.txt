Brief History of the Silkworm-Raising Guardian Deity
The deity honored as the Silkworm Guardian God refers to Wakamusubi-no-kami and Ukemochi-no-kami recorded in the Engishiki (codes and procedures of the Engi era), who are the ancestral deities of sericulture. In ancient times, a shrine was established beside the Jizo Bodhisattva of this temple, with images of weaving maidens in Chinese and Korean-style garments enshrined nearby. However, during the Eiroku period (1558-1570), the shrine buildings were destroyed and it became a ruined shrine, so the deity has been enshrined together with this Jizo statue in the hall. Then, this year on the dawn of the 2nd day of the 2nd month, an elderly traveler came and said: "Long ago there was a shrine to the Silkworm-Raising Guardian Deity in this place, but many years have passed since it fell into ruin. Now, if the venerable priest has the will to rebuild the shrine altar as it was before and enshrine the deity, it will become the guardian of sericulture and the foundation for national prosperity and the flourishing of all people. Do you think it presumptuous for someone like us to speak of such matters?" Then he departed.

Thinking this was indeed a mysterious divine connection, when we examined the temple's ancient records and origin stories, everything matched perfectly. Realizing that this was entirely a divine revelation conveyed through the traveler by the guardian deity, we hurriedly began speaking to people whose profession involves this work.

And so they planned the restoration of the shrine. Generally speaking, this is a guardian deity for the prosperity of businesses dealing with silk fabrics, thread, cotton and the like, so it is a deity that should be revered and worshipped by people of all social classes, both men and women. If one continuously offers sincere devotion without neglecting faith, how could the miraculous blessings of divine protection be in vain?

Long ago, during the reign of Emperor Ōjin, female artisans skilled in silk and brocade weaving were sent from the state of Wu (as recorded in the Nihonki, Volume 1, and the Honchō Tsūki). Particularly in our country, the two ancestral deities Wakamusubi-no-kami and Ukemochi-no-kami raised silkworms, and Emperor Yūryaku had his empress raise silkworms and ordered mulberry leaves to be planted throughout the provinces. The techniques of female artisans in silk and brocade weaving were transmitted, and from the time when the weaving of silk gauze, brocade and other fabrics began, sericulture and the weaving industry spread widely throughout Fusō (Japan), flowing from the capital to all provinces. That people continue this work and make it their family business is entirely due to receiving the blessings of these two deities and the silk and brocade weaving traditions. Therefore, to repay this benevolence, if one visits this deity with faith and makes offerings, there can be no doubt that through the increasing protection of the divine spirit, one's family business will prosper and achieve complete satisfaction.

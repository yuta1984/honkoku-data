1. Before the lion's dormancy period, twice daily use chopsticks to separate the silkworm clusters.
　This is called "ke-wake" (hair separation). At this time, for example, if silkworms occupy about one shaku square,
　the silkworm clusters should be spread out in eight directions to about one shaku two or three sun square.
　Gradually following this principle, spread out the silkworm clusters so they are
　evenly distributed.
1. On the third day after the silkworms are born, replace the silkworm bedding for the first time. The method

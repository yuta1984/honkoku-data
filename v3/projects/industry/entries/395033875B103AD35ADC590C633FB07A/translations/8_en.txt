The silkworm bedding that has been properly maintained should be replaced every two days as before.

1. When they wake up from the garden dormancy, feed them cut mulberry once, then branch mulberry is fine. From this point on, replace the silkworm bedding daily. From the third day after the garden awakening is complete, they will finally eat mulberry in large quantities. From this time on, depending on the weather, all doors and shoji screens on all four sides should be removed. Particularly on the fifth and sixth days, they should be fed plenty of mulberry. At this time, no matter how much you give them, they will eat it. Around the eighth and ninth days after the garden awakening, the silkworms gradually become transparent like crystal and grow thin. At this time, arrange dead branches of hemlock or azalea wood with many branches in another container, put the transparent silkworms inside, spread straw thinly on top, and raise it up to a high shelf. After five or six more days have passed, harvest the cocoons. Put them directly into a container, expose them to wind, and after seven or eight days, take them out to sunny places to dry. If it is rainy weather at this time, use a drying basket over heat.

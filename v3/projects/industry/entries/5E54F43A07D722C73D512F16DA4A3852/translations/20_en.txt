We select with particular care, and furthermore assign rankings of high and low
according to the quality grade of the seeds, which we present to you. Regarding this matter, we have now reformed and
consulted among all our associates, established a sericulture association, and firmly established regulations,
ensuring that inferior products are never shipped. We have appointed referees and association heads as supervisors,
and when customers from various provinces visit each year, we will
convene together and determine the prices of silkworm seeds. Of course, the aforementioned
seed names and family names are clearly displayed for your viewing, so even first-time

customers, regardless of where they place their orders, will receive our most careful
examination and service. Of course, even customers from distant provinces who have no
connections with our locality, if they place
orders of any amount by adding a deposit and sending via express messenger
by the end of April each year, we will prepare the seeds during the peak moth season,
recording your name beside the seed specification list, and deliver them to you.
The remaining payment should be delivered to arrive at our location by June 20th.

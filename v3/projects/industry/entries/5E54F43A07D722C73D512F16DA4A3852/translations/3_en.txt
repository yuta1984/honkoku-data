Those who commit repeated fraud monopolize trade privately, troubling many people and sullying the reputation of our village. This has been my worry for many years, and I cannot put a stop to it. This time, I have invited people who sell silkworm seeds to form a sericulture association, and have written this small booklet called "Silkworm Seed Directory" to serve as a reference for people of the world. I want to enlighten all people engaged in sericulture with the knowledge to distinguish authenticity, eliminate bad seeds, make them seek genuinely excellent seeds, and prevent disasters caused by counterfeit products.

Also, when people join the good silkworm seed association or when people leave the association, I will revise the roster at those times to make it clear at a glance for those purchasing seeds. I hope this will also serve as one measure to prevent counterfeit seeds.

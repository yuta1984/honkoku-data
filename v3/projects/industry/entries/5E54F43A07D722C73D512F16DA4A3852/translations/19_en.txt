　　　　Statement
We respectfully congratulate you all on your continued good health and prosperity.
Regarding the matter of silkworm seeds from both Date and Shinobu counties in our province,
we have been receiving orders from you for many years, and merchants
have continued to visit us despite the long distances, increasingly
entrusting us with business, for which we are deeply grateful. As a result, we have devoted ourselves earnestly to sericulture,
raising numerous varieties, with good silkworm characteristics and cocoon quality, focusing on varieties with high silk yield

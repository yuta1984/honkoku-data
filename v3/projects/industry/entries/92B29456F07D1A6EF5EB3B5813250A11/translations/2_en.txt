1. When about sixty to seventy percent appear to be hatching, sift refined rice bran that is free from moisture to remove dust, spread it about five bu thick on a straw mat, open the wrapping paper and place the egg paper on top. Chop mulberry leaves very finely and sprinkle them on the egg paper, leave for half a day.

   After about this time has passed and they have hatched well, use crow feathers to gently sweep them directly onto the bran, being careful not to damage the silkworms' legs. The second sweeping should be done in the same manner onto a separate straw mat.
   Alternatively, attach strings to the four corners of the egg paper, have two people hold it, and tap from behind with something like bamboo grass to knock them off without harming the silkworms' legs, which is said to be good.
   Note that the straw mat should be wiped with mugwort from beginning to end.

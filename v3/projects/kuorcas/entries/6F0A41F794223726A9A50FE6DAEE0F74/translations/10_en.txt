That Yoshisada died under swords and spears - surely this story is not false. Originally, Kō no Moronao had set his heart on the wife of Enya Hangan (Takasada), and seeing her beautiful appearance and graceful deportment, he found her increasingly lovely and was fully inflamed with lustful passion. Hearing this, the Military Guard (Ashikaga Takauji) listened to the detailed response and immediately said: "Now hearing Katsuyoku's (Lady Enya's) detailed answer, it is indeed as she says. Therefore, the forty-seven scattered helmets left behind have all been placed in this chest and need to be sorted through." The personnel in charge of affairs, receiving the command, respectfully opened the heavy lock and brought them out. Lady Katsuyoku, without haste or panic, walked up close to look, and saw helmets of various styles and designs. Among them was one helmet with a dragon-neck design, and even before speaking of its authenticity, the famous incense fragrance was already emanating from it. Katsuyoku picked up the helmet and reported: "This is precisely the helmet of Yoshisada that passed through my hands." When this was brought forward, the assembled people finally knew it was authentic. The Military Guard gave the command for Enya and Mōmoi to accompany him to store it in the sacred repository, and again ordered Katsuyoku to withdraw. So she arose and departed. The two men, Enya and Mōmoi, attended and proceeded directly into the shrine.

Lady Katsuyoku remained behind with no pretense, and said to Kō no Moronao: "Having completed the public business, you have truly been troubled. I have already received the command to withdraw. If I do not retire, I fear I will violate the command. I wish to take my leave and withdraw." Kō no Moronao rushed over, grasped her sleeve to stop her and said: "Wait a moment. Just as today's business is completed, I wanted to show the lady something. Fortunately, there was this public command that brought you here. That General Minamoto (Ashikaga Takauji) is acting as a matchmaker for me. You must also know that I ordinarily enjoy poetry and song, revere Yoshida Kenkō as my teacher, and correspond with him daily. He has just entrusted me with a letter of poetic exchange, asking the lady to read it and grant a favorable response. I await your immediate reply." Speaking thus without impropriety, while talking he took out the letter from his sleeve.

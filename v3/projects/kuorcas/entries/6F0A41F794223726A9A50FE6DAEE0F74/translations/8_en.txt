The rooster of the nine heavens sends its call to the palace walls / When court attendants enter for morning audience, the dawn light lingers long
The red clouds of the northern palace welcome the ceremonial sword / The white snow of the southern mountains reflects on the hanging robes
The incense of the imperial brazier is left to the breathing of qilin / The seats of immortals follow the procession of phoenixes and herons
When edicts are drafted, clouds of five colors rise from Phoenix Pool / Knowing to attend with brush and ink in service to the enlightened king

Minamoto Military Guard (Tadayoshi) said to High Administrator (Moronao): "What is placed in this chest is the helmet that Emperor Go-Daigo bestowed upon Minamoto no Yoshisada. Though he was an enemy, he was actually a descendant of Emperor Seiwa, and clearly had worn this before. It would be heartless to discard it. This time, following orders, you should reverently accept it in this storehouse. You must understand well."

High Administrator said: "This is an inappropriate imperial command. If we consider Yoshisada as part of the Seiwa Genji lineage and accept the helmet he wore, it would show respect. Among the current large and small governors under our command, there are very many who are Seiwa Genji, so the order to reverently accept this is not prudent and shows no restraint."

In reply, Wakasa-no-suke said: "Not so. According to this humble official's foolish opinion, this is entirely the Shogun's best stratagem. That is, by showing respect for the Nitta clan's remaining helmet, we can make those defeated remnant soldiers feel our benevolent virtue, and without taking up arms, this is a way to simply invite them to surrender. This appropriate discussion particularly seems discourteous."

High Administrator angrily said: "You call me discourteous to my face - why do you resist this humble official? Listen, when Yoshisada died, with disheveled hair and in disarray, there were forty-seven helmets scattered around his corpse. Which one could be recognized as genuine? If we carelessly select one to reverently accept, later if it turns out not to be genuine, it would provoke people's laughter. Moreover, you are a young person whose baby hair still remains, and to interject and argue without waiting for orders is utterly inappropriate. You must keep your mouth shut and sit quietly." He spoke harshly, relying only on his authority. When Wakasa-no-suke was thus rebuked and was about to explode in anger, Judge Enya, seeing his expression change as he was about to speak, said: "Although what the Administrator argues is reasonable, what Lord Momoi says also requires..."

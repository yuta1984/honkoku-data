Synopsis...Female thief O-aki, who walks life's shadowy path, returns with her underlings Genshichi and Hanji after completing a job. Pursued by police agents and cornered, she jumps into the Okawa River and is rescued by Yaju, a poor fisherman living day to day, staying at his home afterward. As three days, four days, ten days pass, Yaju increasingly trusts O-aki to the point where he wishes her to become his eldest son Sokichi's bride. However, for O-aki, while she cannot express how happy Yaju's increasingly devoted care makes her, knowing nothing of her true nature, the more he trusts her, the more painful her situation becomes. One day, when a fabric Yaju had thoughtfully provided got damaged and she went to exchange it, she met her companions Genshichi and Hanji on the way back, who told her to return to the gang. But O-aki, deeply moved by Yaju's sincerity, firmly refused, saying she intended to leave the criminal life behind. At that moment, seeing Sokichi emerge dejectedly from what appeared to be a gambling den, O-aki was suddenly struck by unease. Sure enough, Sokichi had been swindled out of fifty ryo from the shop by a gambling expert named Seibei. When O-aki gently consoled the desperate Sokichi who was contemplating death, though she had once intended to leave her criminal life behind, she ended up pickpocketing the fifty ryo from Seibei during the crowded Tenno festival.

Synopsis...Struggling writer Tanigawa Shigeo, whose parents opposed his marriage to his lover Miyako, left home prepared for financial hardship and was living with her in an apartment. Daily, he wrote manuscripts that wouldn't sell while Miyako continued working as a bar hostess as before to sustain their living. Miyako felt sad when thinking of Shigeo's family situation, but was happy. Shigeo went to his uncle, the most understanding among his relatives, to request help finding employment, but was instead persuaded to leave the woman and return home. Furthermore, when he met Mr. Kageyama at a certain newspaper company, there too was a scheme orchestrated by his uncle to make him separate from Miyako in exchange for employment, so he refused the job. At Shigeo's family home, his parents and sister Toshiko worried about him daily. One day she accidentally met her brother. Toshiko, understanding her brother's feelings toward Miyako, followed him to visit Miyako at the apartment. There Toshiko discovered gentle Miyako and took a complete liking to her, calling her "elder sister." Toshiko told her mother about her brother's situation and subtly worked on their stubborn father to permit the couple's marriage. Toshiko would invite Miyako to movies and secretly give her spending money, comforting her to "endure a little longer." Though the bleakness from financial hardship sometimes made Shigeo irritable, seeing Miyako who believed in him wholeheartedly made him feel sorry for her, and he would visit his uncle again seeking employment.

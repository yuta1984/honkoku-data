Theme Song

Filled with burning blood
There are no enemies before me
Overflowing in my chest is the power of youth
Behold the strong standing group of young men
The gallant figures of those aiming for the crown

Filled with burning blood
The iron wall formation stands firm, straight balls fly like arrows
The resounding crack of the bat echoes in the autumn sky
Behold the strong standing group of young men
The gallant figures of those aiming for the crown

Filled with burning blood
Proudly raising eyebrows, facing the enemy like fire
Protecting our eternal alma mater as we advance
Behold the strong standing group of young men
The gallant figures of those aiming for the crown

Original Story/Screenplay: Mamada Kiyoshi, Director: Nikawa Buntaro

　　　　Realization of the Problem of Weekly Programming Changes
　In News No. 67, D declared that regarding the weekly programming changes that had long been a pending issue, they would seek firm yet moderate final negotiations and would certainly put this into practice soon. Indeed, the demand was thoroughly met! The issue was approved! Finally, it has been decided that weekly programming will begin upon the completion of D's upcoming major spring special program. We enter the second step of our reform, and D's struggle truly lies ahead. Dear gentlemen! We ask for even greater support.

　　　　　Nikkatsu Company's New Film Contracts
Nikkatsu Company has contracted new films from First National and Goldwyn companies through their representatives who recently came to Japan, and has already imported several of these. Both companies, along with Paramount and Artcraft, are America's first-class film production companies. First National has Griffith films, Pickford films, Talmadge sisters films, Stewart films, and Chaplin films, while Goldwyn has Farrar films, Frederick films, Rex Beach films, Normand films and other major works. Moreover, they recently completed contracts for German films, and European and American masterpieces are being imported one after another. The fierce struggle and activity of Nikkatsu and D in the coming changes in the six districts—no, in the great film war of the East—will truly be remarkable.

　　　　About the Major Smiling Convention
Previously—no, in the recent four sessions—D's unique Smiling Convention has featured both Chaplin and Douglas films, but this has circumstances that make it difficult to continue in practice. Both are giants of the industry and are not permitted in terms of economics and programming. From this time, they will be separated to become D's unique major shotgun blast. Douglas films will be screened soon with other masterpieces.

　　　Oh, Our Beloved Cheerful Fellow Douglas!
The portrait of Douglas Fairbanks that was promised to be donated to the gentlemen who admire him through D, when his manager Mr. Tanaka Kinji came to Tokyo last autumn, has been delivered since several days ago. The number is actually over 10,000. The cheerfully smiling image of you overflows with true feeling and is quite graceful. D cannot contain its emotion. We display your portrait here and express our heartfelt gratitude to you and Mr. Tanaka along with all gentlemen.

　　　　　One Word Every Ten Days

　　　　Declaration of Going to Battle
　　　　　　　　　　　Kasumi-sei
"Speech is silver, silence is golden."
Silver is no match for gold. However, to make silver into gold—no, to make silver attain gold's position—first requires the destruction of gold. From the philosophy that says D'Annunzio's complete possession lies in destruction, if we think it through, speech too can eventually become gold. It's not impossible. And this is why speech should not be neglected.
For such reasons—or perhaps sophistry—the determination to maintain silence has finally been ruined. And the ambition to say something keeps rising up.

To see, feel, and write—this alone is insufficient to create valuable criticism. It's inadequate. To see, feel, simultaneously have critical impulse arise, and then write—at least these four elements are necessary. Of course, criticism written with critical impulse is not necessarily good, but if one attempts to write criticism with some authority, criticism forced without critical impulse has no value. A man named Spingarn says "The imaginative spirit and the critical spirit fundamentally coincide."
Both creators and critics have fundamentally identical mental processes at the climax of their expressive abilities. That is, both creation and criticism can be accomplished through imagination.
Don't people generally undervalue criticism too much? At the very least, criticism should be done seriously. Frivolous criticism filled with worthless abuse and flowery nonsense, extremely childish quarrels and arguments has no authority.
Especially since moving pictures are now recognized as legitimate art, criticism of films should not be taken lightly.
I've spoken quite harshly, but if you think of this as a soliloquy, it shouldn't make you particularly angry.
Anyway, I'll start writing something carelessly from next week. Even though I say "carelessly," in a world full of nonsense, one can't say thoughtless things. Since it's "careless" talk spoken with responsibility for every word and phrase, it's troublesome.
I am being whipped by the whip I myself wielded. Even though I myself cannot yet write proper criticism—I hear the fierce sound of the whip in my chest. How shameful.

　　　　　　　Grand and Small Observations

　　　　Just as I Felt
　　　　　　　　　　　Shotaro
　The power of the original author who depicted the religious conflict between the Aztec and Spanish races that occurred in medieval Mexico as the main framework of the drama, and portrayed the delicate romance between Montezuma's beloved daughter and her lover, a young warrior from the enemy side, is great. And I think DeMille's skill in directing this work so gorgeously and gracefully to completion is also great.
In every age we see examples, but behind public or personal rise and fall, we always discover the bewitching power of women. And we are given a kind of trembling feeling. Seeing this miraculous dramatic plot, I cannot help but feel this even more.
Cortés, who tried to lead the pagan masses to Christianity, finally annihilated the Aztec race. Moreover, he accomplished this through tragic war. We find only a single woman behind such public rise and fall.
I think the influence that paganism had on people's hearts in the medieval period was deeper and greater than that of Christianity. And this reaction probably caused even a hero like Montezuma to dare perform such ghastly acts as human sacrifice.
The character of Tesca, living in the dissolute and idle Aztec palace surrounded by many attendants, was expressed by Farrar. In her performance, there was nothing frivolous or showy, but it was sincere and overflowing with emotion. Seeing her attitude as she knelt before the god of beauty to save the young man, her expression when she realized that Montezuma had been captured by the enemy, her facial expressions when she spoke painful love with the young man while reminiscing about the golden age of the past by the valley stream—I recognize that Farrar's artistic style is truly great and majestic—though of course much is also received from DeMille's direction and the surrounding scenes.
The other actors also all performed with understanding. I would like to comment on Mr. Reid as well, but I'll wait until the next opportunity.

　　　　If You Truly Love
　　　　　　　　　　　Uchida Tokuji
　Everything has its own weaknesses. Since the weekly report itself is the theater's house organ, it must protect the theater's interests to some degree. That is precisely the weekly report's own weakness. Yet among letter writers, there are those who take advantage of this weakness and merely send flattering articles to satisfy their desire to contribute. They either misunderstand that film criticism means flattery, or they are cowards who would beat drums just to make their names known—if only that were true criticism and brought happiness to the theater they love.
However, if we truly love D, we must use the so-called "good medicine tastes bitter" approach.
Therefore, I don't write nonsensical praise. I love D! So I offer extremely bitter medicine, if not good medicine.
D has the magnanimity to accept this gladly. I rejoice in that.
People who love D! Let us make sincere criticisms, give advice, and offer praise, and drive away insincere flattery from D's News!
Together with D's major productions...

　　　Beauty!!
　　　　　　　　　　　Katsuji
　For humans to suffer, work, and fulfill life, there must be some purpose there. What is it? Wealth! Success! No. It ultimately comes down to "Beauty" itself.
Humans always have the instinct to have such feelings. Therefore, they pray to encounter beauty even a little, hoping to touch it. Even when watching films, they never stop hoping for things that should be "Beautiful."
Great artistic films! Many of them are all incarnations of "Beauty." "The Daughter of the Gods," "A Woman," and the highly anticipated "The Woman God Forgot" by the famous actress Miss Farrar—all are completely filled with beauty.
Such films—that is the "Beauty" in cinema that we truly seek.
"The Woman God Forgot"—what a magnificent, majestic, supremely beautiful thing it is! First, one's heart is struck by the beauty of the palace. The great stone steps in the castle that fully expressed the color of dawn, the nature of the great forest where the king's beloved daughter Tesca spends her remaining life alone—I felt as if I were wandering in a country of beauty. Especially at the beginning of the film, keeping Miss Farrar's absolutely charming eyes in close-up for a long time deepened the impression beyond mere beauty.
Through this film, I must be grateful that I was able to immerse myself in the very "Beauty" I seek.

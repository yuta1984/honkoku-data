　　　　Praise
　　　　　　　　　　　　K Academy, Waki Aisen
Oh "The Woman God Forgot" that fulfilled our expectations!
We must pour forth all voices of praise for it.
Ah... mystery, grandeur, magnificence, profundity—a great literary film that fully displays all of these!
Awakened D-boy, in films, in the nobility and beauty of programs, and when the final innovative weekly programming is realized, at that time D-boy will become something perfect, without any flaws, something to be loved.
"The Woman God Forgot" as a true work of art—there will be no one who does not raise voices of praise and respect.
The greatness of the artistic influence it gave us!
The profound, unforgettable impression!
Farrar! Her expression that fully possessed that thoroughgoing flavor and showed profound beauty. I had to be moved, exclaim, and praise. And we must be grateful to director DeMille. The deep, vivid impression throughout the six reels will never leave my mind.

　　　　Bessie's Skill
　　　　　　　　　　　Akikei-sei
　A new Blanton film appeared unexpectedly, and I never thought to find comedy in Bessie. The plot of a girl disguising herself as a boy, joining the cowboys, and showing accidental heroism is common enough, but look at Bessie's skill in making it so entertaining! The detailed, thorough facial expressions and movements always observable gave off a natural comedic flavor throughout, leaving no heaviness or persistence. While admiring the actress's skill, I deeply felt how versatile and accomplished an actor she is in all respects. How adorable when she trembles in fear!
The anticipated Farrar drama—a slight dissatisfaction seems to have completely destroyed the impression of the entire film. The princess who bears responsibility for her country's destruction, the only one remaining, who doesn't die and is easily persuaded by the enemy's young man for a most auspicious happy ending...
If the entire film pushes through with powerful love, I wish the ending had been more magnificently concluded.

　　　　Watching the GF Film
　　　　　　　　　　　Akimine Yumeto
　"Among A Company's works, this is the one I'm most confident about," as the actress once stated in Play magazine... no, it was an even greater film than that, which I received from "The Woman God Forgot." The opening text of the prologue reminded me of "Civilization" from afar and "A Woman" from nearby.
The fragrant Mexican location scenes too. The ancient prejudices are fully displayed, showing the luxurious national character, customs and habits, finally showing something like the end of the hero Nero. Especially the latter half is a chapter where the original author and director did their best, as can be seen from DeMille's "My View of Cinematography." And the graceful polonaise "Mignon" and solemn Lohengrin "Bridal March" played alternately at the magnificent and gorgeous wedding were fitting for this film...
Thus the drama reached its climax.
That is, traditional superstition = the view of religious nihilism leads to the previous suggestion that it overthrows from the foundation a society containing all people.

　　　　Foolish Writing
　　　　　　　　　　　Ushigome Seiyoshi
The bell sound echoing high from the fortress, rung sadly and fearfully like the voice of curses and agony bursting from the heart of the sacrifice to be offered to the "god of war"—the curtain falls on that mystical scene, and the daughter Tezca who made the king say "I am not an enemy of the Spanish but an ally, depart peacefully," pitifully driven from the castle, speaking of love with the enemy's young man in the bandits' hut at the mountain foot in the last scene—through this, author MacPherson's skill in skillfully embodying with strong dramatic expression that love is great and absolute is beyond praise, though I regret the Yankeeism of the last scene.
Next, director DeMille's directing method, in whom I have the highest expectations, flowed too much into theatrical form in the scenes, and scene changes seemed to destroy the tension of certain parts. What should be noted is only the grandeur of the overhead shots and the extreme sophistication of the backgrounds.
Farrar's reliable artistic style that proceeds quite naturally without the slightest exaggeration! Her resonance with the role of Tezca and the sincerity of her character portrayal are beyond admiration.

　　　　I Like Comedy
　　　　　　　　　　　K I N-sei
　What I like is comedy. When watching Sennett and such, I discover myself laughing so hard it's embarrassing. For me, Farrar is nothing—I'm waiting for ten days ahead.
There are troublesome people in the world. Some who shed tears watching Chaplin, or worry that Chap's technique might run out. What a tragicomedy!
Speaking of my old man. The old man has no interest in cinema. However, I thought if he saw a thrilling comedy he would probably feel the same interest as us, so I brought him along. I was delighted when I peeked and saw the old man laughing "Ahaha!" But he said... "I can't bear to watch women being violent and crawling into mud without hesitation"... How accustomed our eyes have become.
"Sunnyside" and tragicomedy...
Complaints come after watching.

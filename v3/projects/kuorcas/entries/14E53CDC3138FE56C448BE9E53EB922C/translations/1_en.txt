(5) Comedy-Action "Fat Man's Desert Hero"
"A Desert Hero" in 2 Reels
==Film Concept==
In a desert scorched by the blazing sun, there is a town called Carbolic Camp. The people living here have no morals whatsoever.
Lucky Bob........This man is a native of this wind-blown land, thin and bony, sun-burned.
Bull Neck Bradley........A man with a heart as dark as a tunnel.
Doc Tooth Joe........The troublemaker of this camp, a man who can't live without alcohol, truly a reckless, beast-like villain.
Among such terrible people, there is only one beautiful, lovely girl like a budding flower.
Foxtrot Fanny........Bradley's showgirl who, due to circumstances, has come to this sinful place, but is utterly innocent and so lovely that she worries about picking even a single wildflower.
Here comes "Fat" mountain man Hall.
He is a pistol expert, with dignified appearance, courage, and is a wonderful hero. Eventually elected sheriff by everyone, he drives out the villains, pacifies this terrible land, leads everyone to become Salvation Army believers and completely transforms the town's morals.
Even such a hero has the gentle anguish of love!
"That woman thinks of me........no, or maybe she doesn't think of me at all........"
He suffered such thoughts in secret.
Narration by: Izumi Tenrei

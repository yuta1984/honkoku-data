The Cuckoo
Director Gosho Heinosuke's full-scale representative work of this year
The mountains of Ikaho in early spring were enveloped in the quiet beauty of fresh greenery・・・・・
Newlyweds Kawasaki Takeo and his wife Namiko were exceptionally close, strolling in the shade of trees, whispering under the moonlight, spending delightful days that passed more quickly than expected, but this peaceful newlywed life was disrupted by the appearance of Chijiiwa Yasuhiko. With the devoted care of his pure and lovely wife Namiko, he courageously yet reluctantly departs on a ship for Marshall Islands patrol duty・・・・・
Among the numerous Cuckoo films, this special production film that definitively claims the throne is Kamata's pride. A Shochiku Kinema deluxe edition with stellar main cast members, production staff, and all-star performers・・・・・
Chojiro, who starred in The Golden Demon, once again creates a contemporary film for Kamata Pictures. The director is Gosho Heinosuke, Kamata's sole romantic director. Furthermore, starring in his first pairing with the cheerful Kawasaki Hiroko. A film adaptation using fresh locations in Ikaho, Izu, and Atami.

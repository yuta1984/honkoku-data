　　Main Songs from "The Vagabond King"
　　　Some Day
　　　　Volume 1――
　　　　Princess Catherine, rescued from danger by Villon,
　　　　sings to Villon
　Some day you will seek me
　And you will find me
　Some day, in the days to come
　Surely you will come
　And remind me
　Of the joyful dreams
　That call to you and me

　"SOME DAY"
Some day, you will seek me and find
me......
Some day, of the days that shall de
Surely you will come and remind me,
Of a dream that is calling......
For you and for me
Some day when the winter is over,
Some day in the flush of the Spring
My soul shall discover
The soul born for her lover

The man with the heart of a king

　　If I Were King
　　　　In response to the previous song, Villon sings
　If I were king
　No one but you
　Would occupy my throne
　And bring glory to the throne
　If I were king
　I would perform miracles
　Birds would praise you all day long
　The world would bow before you
　And worship you
　I too would worship you
　If I were king

　"IF I WERE KING"
If I were King
No one but you alone
Would ever occupy and Glorify my
throne
If I were King
What wonder I could do-

The birds would sing your praises
all day through
And then I'd bring
The whole wide world to worship
you
But I would worship, too,
If I were King.

　　Song of the Vagabonds
　　　　Sung courageously by Villon and his hundreds of
　　　　vagabond followers, first in a tavern, and later when
　　　　they attack the Burgundian army― (The popular
　　　　"Kamata March" and others are all plagiarisms of this song)
　Come all you beggars of Paris
　You filthy commoners
　We will help King Louis
　Protect the crown
　And save our city
　From the hands of Burgundy!
　You and I have no value except in death
　We will die for freedom!
　…　…　…　…
　…　…　…　…
　Forward! Forward!

　Point your swords at the enemy!
　Forward! Forward!
　The lily banner advances!
　Sons of France surround us
　Break the chains that bind us
　To hell with Burgundy!

　"SONG OF THE
　　　　　　VAGABOND"
Come all you beggars of Paris town
You lousy rabble of low degree
we'll spare King Louie
to keep his crown
And save our city from Burgundy!
You and I are good for nothing but
to die
We can die for Liberty!
Sons of toiland danger
Will you serve a stranger
And bow down to Burgundy?
Sons of shame and sorrow
Will you cheer tomorrow

For the crown of Burgundy?
Onward! Onward! Swords against
the foe!
Forward! Forward!
The lily banners go!
Sons of France around us
Break the chains that bound us
And to hell with Burgundy!

　"HUGUETTE WALTZ"
　　　　Huguette, having lost Villon, sings in the tavern
　　　　with tears of sorrow
Hearts may flower for an hour
Through they die in a day
Lips may kiss, blind with bless
Ere they learn to betray

Light love, smiling untrue
Bright love, what would you do
If I gave my love to you
Before I wander away?

Never try to bind me
Never hope to know

Take me as you find me
Love and let me go,

Through the loves we leave behind
us
Change and fade away
Never mind, you may be mine, to-
day.

　"LOVE ME TONIGHT"
　　　　On the eve of Villon's assault on the Burgundian
　　　　army the next day, a duet lamenting farewell
　　　　with Princess Catherine
My heart is crying, love, for you,
Love that in a day may be dying
That sorrow will never renew
The hours that we knew
Measure our dream of delight......

Sweetheart, before they go
(Love me
(I love you
Tonight.

・Synopsis・ The year is 1465 AD. Paris, the capital of the Kingdom of France, is besieged by the army of the Duke of Burgundy, a formidable enemy, and the day of the city's fall is imminent.

　At this time, there was a young poet named François Villon who wandered nightly in the taverns of Paris, burning with patriotic fervor. He gathered many vagabonds around him, lamenting the inadequacy of King Louis XI. He was an unparalleled master swordsman of his time, and many vagabonds looked up to Villon as if he were a king. Among them, Huguette, a female beggar, loved Villon so deeply that she would sacrifice her life for him.

　At dawn—Villon happened to encounter Princess Catherine who had come secretly to pray in the quiet church. Enchanted by her extraordinary beauty, he followed her, saved her from villains who attacked the princess, and expressed his burning passion through song.

　Meanwhile, Louis XI in the royal palace summoned an astrologer to divine the fate of the kingdom. The stars foretold that the savior of Paris would come from the back alleys. The king secretly disguised himself and came to Villon's tavern.

　At the same time, General Thibault, who secretly conspired with the Duke of Burgundy to destroy the Kingdom of France and become one of the nobles himself, became deeply enraged when Villon thwarted his plan to kidnap Princess Catherine. He came to the same tavern to kill Villon, but was instead stabbed by Villon's sword.

　King Louis, who secretly witnessed this, believed that Villon was the savior foretold by the stars, and had him captured and brought back to the palace.

　Soon Villon received the title of Count of Montcorbier from the king and was appointed general of the Kingdom of France for only seven days. However, on the morning of the eighth day, he would be sent to the gallows as a vagabond. But he gladly promised to remain in the palace. He and Princess Catherine fell deeply in love with each other. On the last night he was allowed to stay in the palace, they drove away the enemy's envoys who came to demand surrender and held a farewell banquet. However, Thibault, who was thought to have died, had surprisingly recovered from minor wounds and joined the group of vagabonds, plotting to capture the king during this banquet by inciting Huguette, who loved Villon, and others. Villon cleverly outmaneuvered their plan, but poor Huguette was killed by the blade that Thibault wielded to stab Villon. Enraged, Villon thus stabbed Thibault and led many vagabonds to attack the Burgundian army camp. Great victory, great victory! France was placed in great stability, but alas, Villon had to vanish like dew on the gallows according to his original promise. Protected by many vagabonds, Villon was led to the gallows. At that moment, Princess Catherine, who now loved him deeply, ran to his feet, offering everything.

Kō no Moronao, seeing that my lord did not give him bribes, instructed him to bring shame upon my lord. For this reason, I did not explain to my lord, but secretly sent many gold pieces, clothing, and other items. This was not because I willingly wanted to give them to him, but because I thought only to spare my lord's person from that interference. Having received the bribe and being entreated, he saw my lord and made excuses for him to apologize for his sins. For this reason, my lord also did not favor killing him, and finally resolved his resentment. This calamity then transferred to Lord Enya's person.

On that day when he wounded the lord, I only thought that if that person did not die, Lord Enya's person would also be safe, so I immediately ran to stop him. Now I regret it, having caused it to become an immeasurable disaster.

Tonaose and her daughter, with no thought of sparing themselves, said: "We never imagined such a thing would happen. Not only will we die, but it involves father's life as well. How can we escape Heaven's condemnation and sin? We beg your forgiveness ten thousand times." So saying, they fell to the ground weeping and wailing.

Yuranosuke and his wife, all three, understanding the mother and child's feelings, grieved deeply in sorrow. He immediately said to Honzō: "Since ancient times it has been said that a gentleman hates the sin but does not blame the person. Generally speaking, public wrongs and private marriages naturally have their distinctions. Acting according to reason, it should not be like this. I suppose..."

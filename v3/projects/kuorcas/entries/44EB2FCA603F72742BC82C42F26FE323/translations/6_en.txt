"Please choose an auspicious day and prepare to become relatives," she requested. Yuranosuke said, "I never dreamed there would be such a conversation. Right now my master is out and has not yet returned. If he were home to meet you, he would be deeply grateful for your kindness.

When we previously arranged the betrothal, our lord was still alive and I was still receiving a stipend, so for that reason we consulted with each other and made the marriage promise. Now I have become masterless, and the Ōishi house doesn't have a penny to its name. Even though we made a firm promise, for a young lady to marry into our family would be like the folk saying about a temple bell and a paper lantern - when things don't match, it becomes grounds for divorce. Moreover, we never set an official betrothal ceremony date or appointed go-betweens, so there would be no regrets if she remarries anyone else."

Hearing this, Tonase suppressed her anger and said, "For your wife to say such things! If you say your master doesn't match my foolish husband in terms of family status, then please listen to what I have to say. Our lord was an official of a small county, so the foolish husband who serves as his retainer receives only a 500-koku stipend. Lord Enya was a district governor, so Lord Yura who served as his chief retainer had 1,500 koku. Even now that you've become a rōnin, compared to us, there's still a 500-koku difference in your favor."

Yuranosuke said, "There's no need to bring up the matter of 500 koku. Even if there were a 10,000-koku difference, if our hearts are compatible with each other, we would gladly accept her as a daughter-in-law."

Tonase said, "That talk is exactly the important point I want to inquire about. You said our hearts are not compatible - how are they incompatible?"

Yuranosuke said, "Regarding the matter of our lord suffering harm and having his house destroyed, though it was due to his quick temper, it arose from his upright and sincere heart. Your lord is completely the opposite - he sent gold and silver to Kō no Moronao, fawning and flattering to curry favor with him. Such a sycophantic official cannot arrange a marriage between my master's pure and upright son and the daughter of your lord who receives his stipend through such flattery."

Before Tonase had finished listening, she straightened up on her knees and raised her hand, saying, "Sycophantic, you say..."

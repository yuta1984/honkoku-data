...hall, from the interior of the inner chambers, directly to the place where brushwood is released at the water gate, drawn in detail with nothing left unprepared.

Yuranosuke took it in his hands and said: "I am deeply grateful for your kindness. The will of our comrades is already determined, but we simply did not know the layout of the enemy's house and had not yet taken action. This diagram is the military treatise of Sun Wu. We consider this our Six Secret Strategies and Three Tactics. Having already set our agreement for night battle, we will set up scaling ladders against the high walls, leap up to reach the rear garden, and if we remove the rain shutters, that will lead directly to the bedchamber.

Seeing this, Honzō forgot his pain and said: "Excellent! Excellent! Having both righteous spirit and strategy! Lord Enya, having such a retainer, should by rights have understanding, but being extremely impatient, he missed his opportunity. I hear that the household members all regret only that their lord had such a hasty temperament. As for today's matter, to the..."

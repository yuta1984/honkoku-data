"Servants! Go quickly and wait in the hall!" he scolded, pushing him inside and coming directly to shut the gate.

Okatsu immediately pressed against the gate doors and cried out: "Master, I have something to say. Please open the gate!"

Gihei said: "I have no need to listen to your words. I have nothing to say either. You and her father are birds of a feather - wicked woman! Don't interfere here. Leave quickly!"

Okatsu said: "I am not evidence of walking the same path as his father. Let the master look and not harbor suspicion." Saying this, she threw something through the gap in the gate. Gihei hurriedly picked it up. Okatsu also followed and entered.

Gihei looked and said: "This is the divorce letter I gave to your father earlier. What do you intend to do by bringing it back to me?"

Okatsu said: "How heartless! What has that man done? The master has always known my father's scheming ways. Even if he said something, why give him a divorce letter? He claimed he received the divorce letter and told me to serve another husband. I never thought he would devise such a plot. I pretended to be overjoyed, putting him off guard, and finally secretly stole the divorce letter and fled here."

"Master, please look at that child. Isn't he pitiful? To divorce me and take a new bride, having him raised by a stepmother's hand - it's far too cruel!" she said and wept again.

An ancient poet wrote well:

Peach blossoms fall while plum flowers bloom abundantly - How could the spring wind think to enter the bridal chamber?
The swallows fly away and never see us off - The warblers come singing, how busy they are!
Blocking old love, in whose room shall I dwell? - Jealous unto death of the newlyweds going to my rafters
Even borrowing the skill of Qinchuan's brocade loom - It's hard to make the dawn curtains gather mandarin ducks

Gihei said: "You come here in confusion to bury your grievances. Let me tell you about when you return to your family home..."

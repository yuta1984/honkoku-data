"Immediately jump through the front gate into the rear grounds. I will go with Gōuemon through the back gate. At this moment, when the signal flute is blown, that's when you should all rush into the interior at just the right time. Do not injure people recklessly. The only thing we desire is to cut off the head of our one enemy." Everyone received Yuranosuke's orders, each fixing their gaze intently on the enemy's gate, splitting into front and rear groups and heading in both directions.

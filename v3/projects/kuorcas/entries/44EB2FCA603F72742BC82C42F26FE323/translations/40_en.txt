They came cutting in. When Rikiya saw this, he quickly took up his sword and fought them off for a long time, keeping them at bay. When Rikiya saw an opening in their defense, he immediately cut them down, splitting them in two. Pitifully, Shakushi became a guest of the underworld. Turning his hand again, he cut down Sagisaka's leg, and both men gave up their lives to Rikiya's blade.

Alas, how tragic! The people watching Rikiya could not help but cheer. Finally, this group of heroes, through countless hardships and difficulties, had avenged their grievances, annihilated the wicked and treacherous, and exhausted their loyalty and righteousness. There was not a person in the realm who was not moved. Truly they made their names known for a thousand ages and their fame resound for ten thousand years. From this time forth, all under heaven became peaceful and the nation secure. This is truly:

　　The tiger dies but leaves its skin　　Man dies but leaves his name

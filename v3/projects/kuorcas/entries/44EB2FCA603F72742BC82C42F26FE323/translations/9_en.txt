"Please, madam, take action and kill me. Even though I have been divorced, if I die in the enemy's house, I can rest in peace. I want to die quickly."

The mother heard this and said, "You speak so thoughtfully about such things. In that case, I will not kill just one person. I, this mother, will also go with you to the underworld."

The daughter resolved herself with final determination, cleanly wiped away her tears, and stood up. Looking at her:

She wore a single white striped garment, had a half-moon shaped ivory ring on her shoulder, wore a woven grass hat covering her face on her head, had a brocade bag tied at her waist, and carried a gold-tubed bamboo flute.
Thread-like and unstained by dust, drawing out notes and carving commercial tones, appearing ethereal and detached from worldly emotions.

At that moment, "Daughter, listen. Someone has just begun playing the bamboo flute outside the gate. This is called 'The Night Crane Nurturing Chicks.' Even birds and beasts do not abandon the private feelings of love and affection. Looking at you, with no crimes whatsoever, how can I bring myself to take action? It must be predetermined from a previous life."

The more she thought about it, the more she felt her hands and feet trembling. Struggling to grip the sword and looking up, she saw her daughter sitting properly, with hands in prayer, chanting Amida Buddha's name, waiting for death. At that moment, she cried out loudly, "Stop!"

When the mother's hand holding the sword was heard, it stopped along with that bamboo flute. At that time, "Now I heard someone cry out to stop. This must mean the person playing the bamboo flute outside the gate has stopped. With a thousand thoughts of wanting to save you, hearing the voice saying to stop, my heart became confused without realizing it. I must not fear people laughing at me for cherishing you."

When she gripped the sword again, the bamboo flute outside the gate also began playing again, and again someone cried "Stop!" At that time, "Again someone cried 'Stop!' - but to whom are they speaking?"

An answer came from inside: "Just stop moving your hand, and let the child serve as parent."

Hearing this, she said, "Speaking this way - this must be about Ōishi Yoshio. Do you truly consent to become his parent?" Without waiting for an answer, she immediately pushed open the door curtain and began singing of eternal harmony.

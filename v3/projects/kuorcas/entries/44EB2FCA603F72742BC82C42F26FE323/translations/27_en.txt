He came out saying: "Strange! Who is calling me? Surely it's not some demon?"

From outside the gate came the reply: "I am Okatsu. Please open the gate for me."

Igo said: "Even so, it's still frightening. Don't shout and try to scare me."

Saying this while pushing open the gate, he said: "It really is the lady of the house. Good that you've returned. Seeing you walking alone on the road, I was worried you might be eaten by wild dogs."

Okatsu said: "If I had been bitten to death by dogs, so be it. I wouldn't have had to taste such suffering as this. As you know, I was divorced by my husband and sent back to my family home. Is my husband sleeping?"

Igo answered "No."

Okatsu said: "Is he at home or not?"

Igo again said "No."

Okatsu said: "When I ask whether he's here or not, if you only say 'no,' then what exactly is the situation?"

Igo said: "I don't understand what's happening either. Before the night grew deep, some cat must have caught some kind of mouse, and people were shouting 'Caught it! Caught it!' A large crowd of people came rushing in. I was frightened and covered myself with a futon, fell asleep immediately, and don't know what happened afterward. The thunderous commotion died down, and now he's drinking sake with those people in the back parlor."

Okatsu said: "That's truly incomprehensible. Is little Yoshimatsu sleeping?"

Igo said: "He's sleeping soundly indeed."

Okatsu said: "Is he sleeping with the master, or is he sleeping with you?"

Igo said: "He's alone, and fell right asleep."

Okatsu said: "Why don't you let him sleep with you?"

Igo said: "The young master dislikes sleeping with me, and complains that the master has no milk, so he just cries constantly."

Hearing this, Okatsu began to weep and said: "That's the truth. I too have never forgotten that child."

Saying this, she raised her voice and wailed at the gate. Like rain on a clear day, her tears soaked her sleeves before they could dry. At that moment, Gihei came running out, calling and searching for Igo.

Igo said: "I'm right here."

Gihei said: "Ah..."

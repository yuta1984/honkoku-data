Some had lost sons and daughters, but they only wished to see this head. They struck the corpse with their hands and bit the severed head with their mouths. The group was half joyful and half sorrowful, raising their voices in unison and shedding tears of righteous valor.

Yuranosuke immediately took out a memorial tablet from his breast, respectfully and reverently placed it on the table as an offering, wiped clean Kō no Moronao's head and arranged it in front, lit incense, stepped back several paces, performed nine prostrations, and chanted a verse:

"O honored spirit of our deceased lord, with the sword you commanded us to take, we now sever the enemy's head to repay your burial. In the nine springs below, may your lingering thoughts be released."

He also said to the group: "Each of you, come forward one by one and burn incense." The comrades said: "The leader should burn incense first." Yuranosuke said: "Compared to this Yuranosuke, Yajima Jūtarō should burn incense first." Jūtarō said: "How could I dare do such a thing? Seeing everyone show favoritism to me alone, I truly dare not accept." Yuranosuke said: "There is no favoritism whatsoever. The forty-odd men risked their lives many times searching but could not find him, yet you alone discovered and captured him from the woodshed. This is entirely because our late lord's spirit entrusted his soul to you. How enviable! You comrades, why would you argue about this?" Everyone said: "We completely rely on our leader's decision." Jūtarō firmly declined and hesitated uncertainly. Yuranosuke said: "Do not be modest. Burn incense quickly." Jūtarō said "Please forgive me," rose up, and performed the first incense burning.

Everyone urged Yuranosuke to perform the second incense burning. Yuranosuke said: "There is another person who should perform the second incense burning." When everyone asked, "Who is it?" Yuranosuke quickly took out a wicker purse from his breast and said: "This is the soul of Hayano Kampei. Previously, because he had failings due to his poverty, he could not join the group. He says he still wants to vindicate himself.

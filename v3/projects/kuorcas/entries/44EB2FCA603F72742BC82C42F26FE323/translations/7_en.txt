"Who is this sycophantic official you speak of? I cannot let such wrongful accusations pass. Even if I try to endure and forgive with patience, that would only be pretending not to hear for the sake of my daughter's honor. Generally speaking, for a betrothed woman, modesty and obedience are the way of womankind. Since we have already formed an engagement, whether good or bad, whether there be chastity or not, it matters not - no matter what happens, she will become your son's wife."

Yuranosuke said, "This is an amusing conversation. You speak of your son's wife, but it's like a respectable husband divorcing his wife and taking this mother away from the child. Let's stop talking about this," and he stood up and went straight into the room, slamming the paper door shut and disappearing behind the partition.

Konami saw this situation and began crying aloud, saying, "Though we promised marriage based on both sides' feelings, relying only on making me happy as a parent, I came here with joy reaching to the heavens, yet my mother-in-law treats me so cruelly. I have done nothing wrong. Why are you trying to make me give up? Please, madam, persuade him well. Please let me become a bride," she said, tears flowing like rain.

Yet after you traveled this long distance with great hardship to get here, without even informing the groom, he speaks of divorce without any consideration. I cannot understand your mother-in-law's intentions. Surely now that he has become masterless, suffering from daily privation beyond endurance, he merely brings up his ancestral lineage to act important. With a son-in-law who puts on airs and a daughter with a flighty, careless nature - he has already betrayed duty and broken his promise. My daughter also knows this kind of character, so now that he speaks of divorce, let him have his way. There are many others seeking marriage proposals, so instead we'll find you a good match to be your husband."

The daughter was told, "Stop crying for a while and give a clear answer whether you agree or not."

Konami said, "Madam, please don't speak of such dishonorable things. When the discussion began at home, my father told me..."

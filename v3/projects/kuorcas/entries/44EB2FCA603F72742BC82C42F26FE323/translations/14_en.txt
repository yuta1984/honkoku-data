"You will surely harbor resentment in your heart. After all, we are not people of this world. Let me show you our final innermost feelings." So saying, he immediately pushed open the sliding doors, and in the rear garden, taking those snow blocks, he fashioned them into the style of a five-story stone pagoda grave marker, revealing the state of his own burial after death.

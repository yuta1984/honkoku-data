"To receive gifts means taking on tremendously troublesome affairs like a sea of blood. Do you deceive and mock me, thinking that as a merchant you can buy my spirit with gold and silver?"

Yuranosuke said: "That is not so. We are bidding farewell to depart for the other world, while you remain in this world and must later care for the lady. Therefore, I wish to express a modest courtesy. Please accept it."

Saying this, he ran away toward the outside.

The more Gihei listened, the angrier he became. The fires of ignorance blazed up beyond endurance, and he said: "To make me appear as a greedy person who covets money! What a lawless way to look down on me! It's so disgusting I can't bear to watch." He stretched out his foot and kicked it back. Then one item rolled out. When Kasshōno saw it,

She came rushing in from outside the gate and said: "These are my hair ornaments and comb, my cut hair, and this package contains the divorce papers."

First, to make your father abandon thoughts of remarriage; second, so that no one would seek to kill you to avenge a marriage proposal. The day of revenge will not exceed one hundred days, and your hair will also grow thick and long after one hundred days.

For now, temporarily spend a season or half a year as a nun doing needlework, with Ōhashi Bungo and Yama Jūtarō as go-betweens, jointly guaranteeing not to leak the secret plan. This is to reassure our allies and dispel their doubts. I will immediately serve as mediator in the other world."

Gihei said: "I deeply appreciate your kindness. Kasshōno, you should also express your gratitude."

Kasshōno thanked him and said: "The debt for saving my life will never be forgotten, even in death."

Yuranosuke said: "There's no need for excessive thanks. Your kindness cannot be fully repaid. If my brother were not a merchant, I would urge him to accompany us, which is greatly regrettable.

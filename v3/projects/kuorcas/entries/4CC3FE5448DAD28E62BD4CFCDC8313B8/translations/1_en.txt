Theme Song "Over the Hills"
Lyrics: Shimada Yoshifumi
Music: Koga Masao

(Verse 1)
Let's go over the hills
The clear blue sky is bright
Our hearts are cheerful and clear
The lifeblood pulses in our chests
Praise our youth!
Come, let's go far toward hope
Over the hills

(Verse 2)
Let's go over the hills
The Indian summer sky is serene
Our hearts are pure and joyful
Springs well up in our chests
Praise our youth!
Come, listen to the distant hope
The bells are ringing

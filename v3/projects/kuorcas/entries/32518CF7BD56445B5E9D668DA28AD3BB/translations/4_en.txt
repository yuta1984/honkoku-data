The Story of King of Kings
Looking back, －－ah! Our thoughts reach back to the distant past of 2000 years ago. －－Among the "Wandering Jews" who were experiencing days of blood-stained suffering under the oppression of the Roman Empire, which had flourished in the splendor of its great garden, Mary Magdalene, the darling of her generation, was holding grand banquets day and night with the dissolute young men who gathered around her incomparably enchanting beauty. Tonight too she was in the sea of light from the banquet, but for some reason there was a shadow of melancholy on her brow. This was because her lover Judas Iscariot had not shown himself at her side recently. －－What kind of beautiful woman could it be who keeps beloved Judas away from her? －－This was her source of melancholy. However, what had drawn Judas away from her was not actually a beautiful woman. It was a poor carpenter from Nazareth, Jesus Christ.

Jesus was on a missionary journey, taking the precious heart of God as his own heart. Sometimes he raised the dead, sometimes he gave light to the blind, and other times he made the lame walk, manifesting miracle after miracle. He was now the savior bearing the hopes of the world.
Even the pampered Mary, who had driven her chariot to steal away her lover, could not match his inner power. －－At that time, Caiaphas, the high priest of unparalleled authority, felt indignant about Jesus's actions. His anxiety about his own position, honor, and wealth grew day by day along with Jesus's reputation. －－And so, Caiaphas's relentless persecution of Christ began.

The King of Cinema Comes!
"King of Kings" is truly
the king of cinema that will save this world!!
Our thoughts go far back to two thousand years ago, when the Roman Empire boasted of its splendor and magnificence, yet under its oppression, the days of blood-stained suffering continued for those "wandering Jews."
Come forth! Our King of Salvation! —— Voices crying out in hunger, thirst, and blood painted the streets of Rome red.
At that time, —— the star that once shone in the blue sky of Bethlehem now appeared before them as the Savior Jesus Christ. —— Thus the story unfolds, beginning with the lavish great banquet of the beautiful Mary Magdalene, the anguish of Judas Iscariot, the conspiracy of high priest Caiaphas, and the distress of the Roman-appointed governor Pilate. From the holy Last Supper with his twelve apostles to the farewell in the moonlit Garden of Gethsemane, —— to the cross on Golgotha Hill and finally to the dawn of ascension, miracle follows miracle, and light follows light.

—— The scale is magnificent, the structure gorgeous, truly worthy of being called a masterpiece among masterpieces with hardly any equal this season. Moreover, directing this film are Cecil B. DeMille and D.W. Griffith, two great stars of the world cinema. Besides H.B. Warner, Jacqueline Logan, Ernest Torrence, and Joseph Schildkraut, over one hundred leading actors participate. The spectacular presentation with a grand cast of five thousand extras will undoubtedly leave all other ordinary films trailing behind. Above all, the beauty of each scene colored in vivid Technicolor presents a magnificent spectacle unparalleled under heaven. Please have the greatest expectations for the upcoming premiere!

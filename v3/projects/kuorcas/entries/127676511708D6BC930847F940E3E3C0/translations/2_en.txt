Shochiku Film Theme Song
Those Who Cry in the Fields
Lyrics by Sato Hachiro
Music by Horiuchi Keizo

1. Casting away
Love's hope
My figure dissolving
Into the mist
The moon's halo
Through tearful haze
Weak and strong are
Paper-thin apart

2. Though only six years
And months have passed
How completely changed
Are human hearts
Eye masks hiding
The past
Weak and strong are
Paper-thin apart

3. The bouncing handball
Throws and rolls
Men about—
How amusing
Afterward, lonely
Silent weeping
Weak and strong are
Paper-thin apart

4. The character for money
And the character for love—
If these two
Did not exist in this world
How much easier it would be
How lonely too
Weak and strong are
Paper-thin apart

5. Holding back
The departing shadow
What connects
Separated hearts
Is nothing other than
The thread of truth
Weak and strong are
Paper-thin apart

1. Let people's hearts
Change as they may
Once you start doubting
There's no end
Stained tears are
Left behind
Let's live
Laughing lonely

2. Pretending not to know
While knowing too much
Always with sideways glances
And composed faces
Stained tears are
Left behind
Let's live
Laughing lonely

3. Of the distant past
Let's not speak
Forget yesterday
Think only of tomorrow
Stained tears are
Left behind
Let's live
Laughing lonely

4. Who is it that knocks
At love's door?
Should I open or not—
A moment's thought
Stained tears are
Left behind
Let's live
Laughing lonely

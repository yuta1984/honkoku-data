What connects us
Is nothing other than
The thread of truth
Weak and strong are paper-thin apart

1. Let people's hearts
Change as they may
Once you start doubting
There's no end
Stained tears are
Left behind
Let's live
Laughing lonely

2. Pretending not to know
While knowing too much
Always with sideways glances
And composed faces
Stained tears are
Left behind
Let's live
Laughing lonely

3. Of the distant past
Let's not speak
Forget yesterday
Think only of tomorrow
Stained tears are
Left behind
Let's live
Laughing lonely

4. Who is it that knocks
At love's door?
Should I open or not—
A moment's thought
Stained tears are
Left behind
Let's live
Laughing lonely

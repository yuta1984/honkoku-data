Shochiku Film Theme Song "Those Who Cry in the Fields"
Lyrics by Sato Hachiro, Music by Horiuchi Keizo

1. Casting away the hope of love
My figure dissolving into mist
Moon's halo through tearful haze
Weak and strong are paper-thin apart

2. Though only six years have passed
How completely hearts have changed
Eye mask hiding the past
Temari ball that bounces
Throws and tumbles men about
Such amusement, then later
Lonely hidden weeping
Weak and strong are paper-thin apart

4. If the characters for "money" and "love"
Did not exist in this world
How much easier it would be, how lonely
Weak and strong are paper-thin apart

5. Holding back the departing shadow
The separated heart... (incomplete)

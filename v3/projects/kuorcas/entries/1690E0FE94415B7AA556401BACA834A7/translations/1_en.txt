Synopsis　With the whole nation debating loyalism versus the shogunate, a man stands resolutely against the mighty Shinsengumi - Kurama Tengu. His actions remain hidden, his whereabouts still unknown. In the schemes of Kondo Isami and Hijikata Toshizo, today is the Setsubun festival, and Mibu-dera temple grounds are in chaotic commotion. The Shinsengumi's female spy, Kurayami no Okane, mixed with the crowd wearing a demon mask, while Kurama Tengu wore an Otafuku mask, and Kurohime Kichibei was also there. Hayabusa no Choshichi, boss of the kakubei lion dancers and holder of the jitte, had young boys Sugi and Shinkichi dancing under his cruel rule. In this crowd were Okita and other Shinsengumi members. Just then, a masked man standing on the veranda, pretending to throw beans but actually scattering leaflets - Kurama Tengu. Seeing these leaflets, Okita cried "The Tengu appears!" and the Shinsengumi rushed out, with Okane in action, but by then Tengu had already returned home and sat in meditation at Shogetsuin temple.

Synopsis　In the cramped restaurant alley of Asakusa's sixth district, the regulars gathering at Sampei's oden shop were people living humble lives: Sugino Kyoji, a minor actor in the sword-fighting troupe of Shintaka Yoko who was sulking about being cast as a tiger in the current play; the street fortune-teller Tenkuken Meikyoshisui-koji; old man Koyama, a medicine peddler with the fearsome child Etsu-chan who terrorizes shooting galleries. When female reporter Muraoka Reiko from Entertainment Magazine came to write about life in Asakusa's back streets and was mocked by Mr. Tenkuken, she became interested in Sugino's situation. She had Sampei's oden shop show her around, chattering away smugly before leaving, but Otsuya, Sampei's daughter who harbored feelings for Sugino, was deeply troubled. The Shintaka Yoko troupe opened with "Woman Wato-nai" and unexpectedly Sugino's tiger role was a huge hit, packing the house from opening night. Pleased with this success, troupe leader Yoko reverted to her bad habits and tried to drag Sugino to a dubious establishment, but Sugino firmly refused and went home.

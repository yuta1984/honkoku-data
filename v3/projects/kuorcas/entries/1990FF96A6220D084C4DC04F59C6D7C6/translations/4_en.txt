　The Face of Americanism
　　　　　　　　　　Kitamura Seiro

　I have always thought about how abnormal the minds of the masses might become if they were to view American films purely for entertainment and interest. However, through the fact that all the films shown at Theater D at the end of 1920 were American productions, considerable contradictions of Americanism were discovered individually. Americanism is a ideology that seeks to materialize everything, leaving no life in it, trying to turn things into puppets, and attempting to place art under the control of human power. However, to a certain extent, in a positive sense, it richly provides life and human flavor to art, namely to cinema. That said, materialism destroys cinema. Films completely dominated by Americanism have no life and cannot be recognized as artistic cinema, I believe. If audiences were understanding people, they would not overlook Americanism there, and would reject erroneous film concepts, incorporating proper film appreciation as part of their own lives. But conversely, if they were people without understanding, trusting the uncritical, exclusive, and unreflective basic tone of films, when they are created as possessors of sad character—pathological thinking, crimes devoid of humanity are born. I think it is not a bad thing to consider this.

　In this sense, I call for the critical importance of American film research, and hope for the emergence of narrators who possess proper understanding.

I believe that advancing in this direction must be part of the narrator's social service. Therefore, I am studying the face of Americanism with a calm mind.
　　
　―To the Movers and Shakers of the World
　　　　　　　　　　　　　Kato-nishiki

　The era of being amazed by moving photographs has passed. The era of being surprised that humans eat beef has passed. From katsuben to narrators, from living pictures to cinema, and to the age of music—the world progresses moment by moment. And we have grown tired of foreign films—that is, films of love and money. On the other hand, we have come to yearn for purely Japanese national films. Once around issue twenty of this weekly report, Theater D showed Japanese and foreign films together, and we were deeply grateful for that. But the day when we wish for that again is approaching. Japanese pure films that are not Yankee-like...........

　However, they have gradually turned their eyes to these things and seem to spare no effort in producing them, but aren't those products extremely Yankee-like? We should have even more of our own unique characteristics, and advantages that they should utilize. It is generally the case that high-collar fashion is not the characteristic of our country's women, but the shimada hairstyle is the characteristic of we Japanese people, and this is one example of that.

You movers and shakers of the Taishō 10 era! Know that there is too great a difference between those who enjoy the night intoxicated by champagne, embracing the slender arms of Western women, and those who earnestly wish for the creation of our national pure films!
　　
　　Regarding the "Lion's Roar Convention"
　　　　　　　　Osada Momiha

The "Lion's Roar Convention" was truly a deeply moving enterprise for us fans.

【Lower section】
There are those who do not know what the "Lion's Roar Convention" is about. There are also foolish people who, without knowing its true significance, have simply thought of it as an ordinary old-fashioned gathering. What did Mr. Ishii Koho mean when he began speaking with "Looking back..."? When he said "Escaping from the class looked down upon as katsuben...," it had a tremendous impact on our fans' hearts. Words like "katsuben" are already relics of the previous century. Since moving pictures have become representative of popular entertainment, the narrators who undertake the task of explaining and interpreting them have a great mission to become the center and brain, and bear responsibility. To call them by the term "katsuben" is not what those who have any interest in moving pictures should do. "Now the narrators have awakened"—Yes! They awakened with the crow of the rooster that announced the time at that "Lion's Roar Convention." Since "strike while the iron is hot," I respectfully welcome the New Year of Taishō 10, when the narrators should make their great leap forward.
　　
　　New Year's Sake Rambling
　　　　　　　　　　　　Yukijirō

　Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! It's truly congratulatory. Why? Because Taishō 10, full of so many hopes, has finally arrived! The phrase "In Taishō 10..." has been spoken for quite some time. Now that year called Taishō 10 has approached before our eyes by chance—no, inevitably. And isn't it asking, "Here is the Taishō 10 you've been expecting. What will you do for me?" We must simply strive! Charge toward our ideals! And devote ourselves to the film world.

"Synopsis" In the third month of spring, a daimyo procession heading to Edo passed through Hiratsuka on the Tokaido road.
That night at their lodging, retainers Yoshida Yasutaro and Furukawa Kenjiro went to see a traveling theater troupe that happened to be performing in the area. The troupe leader was a young actress named Nakamura Utakichi. Due to a chance incident, Yasutaro came to know Utakichi, and that night they had a dreamlike romantic meeting by a nearby riverbank. Their relationship continued even after he departed for Edo. However, Yasutaro had a fiancée named Masae, approved by his parents, and Utakichi had a greedy foster mother named O-Tatsu who intended to exploit her until death. Though they were two people who could never truly be together—a strict samurai and an actress—by that time Utakichi was already with child.
Since O-Tatsu knew that Utakichi could not perform with a child, she falsely claimed to send the infant to foster parents and went to extort the Yoshida family. The bride Masae, knowing it was her husband's child, promised to take the child in and gladly fulfill the role of mother.

"Synopsis" The handsome young medical graduate Nakajima Kenichi at Tsunekawa Surgical Hospital and the director's daughter Akiko were in a relationship approved by their parents. Today too, Akiko invited him to the Imperial Theater, but the steadfast Nakajima declined and was spending his night duty when he suddenly discovered a thief had broken into the director's office. Courageously pursuing the shadow, he found that while maintaining friendly relations with the hack writer Araki and university student Miura, someone had snuck into Michiko's room, which she shared with Kimiko. The thief was actually Michiko's degenerate brother, Konan Ryusuke.
Cornered, Konan pointed a pistol and caused chaos in this quiet apartment in Tsuka, but ironically, Konan was killed by Nakajima in self-defense with his own pistol, and Michiko, caught up in the commotion, suffered the tragic fate of losing her sight. When Nakajima's actions were cleared as legitimate self-defense and his injuries from the struggle healed, he was to hold his wedding ceremony with Akiko, but when he happened to encounter the pitiful figure of Michiko, now blind, he resolved to make amends for having killed Konan and caused Michiko's blindness, and prepared to lose his position by breaking off his engagement with Akiko.

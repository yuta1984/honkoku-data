knowledge, this would truly not waste one's inner feelings and would fully appreciate the bond of friendship." Kanpei immediately said,
"I am grateful. I have also roughly discerned that under the pretext of erecting a tomb monument, they are collecting gold
and silver. I want to arrange and seek some money to bring and make my explanations." Though he devised various schemes in his heart, sadly when seeking
such connections, he had no means whatsoever and didn't know whom to approach. There was only his wife Okaru's father,
a man called Yoichibei who, though a farmer, was a reliable person who could provide assistance. Moreover,
regretting the circumstances by which we husband and wife incurred guilt for our lord's sake, so that we might return to

wait to provide the silver." Having said this, they parted left and right. At this time the sound of rain grew fierce again. Now,
Yoichibei alone braved the night and ran, staggering unsteadily. Though the road
was pitch black, he never lost his way. Only for his daughter's sake, he could not avoid being obsessed, this old man

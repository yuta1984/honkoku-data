Katsukaji said: "Liar, don't say useless things."

Yuranosuke said: "If this is not sincere affection arising from the heart, it would be unacceptable. Please, I beg for your consent."

Katsukaji said: "Sir's is a lie that comes from true feelings."

Yuranosuke said: "I will unite with you and free you from the life of the pleasure quarters."

Katsukaji responded playfully.

Yuranosuke said: "As proof that this is not false, I promise you tonight that I will redeem your freedom."

Katsukaji said: "Thank you for your kindness. However, I have another love."

Yuranosuke said: "If there is such a man, I will unite you with him."

Katsukaji said: "Is this really true?"

Yuranosuke said: "I swear to the gods, I only want to share a bed with you as husband and wife for three days, and after that I will leave everything to your wishes."

Katsukaji said: "You're not making me grateful only to turn around and laugh at me later, are you?"

Yuranosuke said: "I'll go immediately and settle her redemption money, so that your situation will have no complications. Rest assured and wait."

Katsukaji said: "If you think so, it's just being husband and wife for three days?"

Yuranosuke said: "Naturally, it's entirely up to you."

Katsukaji expressed countless thanks to him, and then singing could be heard from within the hall:

"The vicissitudes of worldly fate give birth to a hundred sorrows, I only think of the feelings after parting from my beloved
My soul is in my hometown, my body is here, sorrowfully listening to the voice of traveling birds in the quiet night"

When Katsukaji heard this, it was all about the suffering of her own situation, and with her tender heart full of countless thoughts, she felt increasingly troubled and restless. There is an old verse that expresses it well:

"The verdant willows on the embankment, the beautiful trees before the tower, the spring wind blows unsteadily, east and west
Morning and evening, born as a woman wishing to have a home, why am I alone so unfortunate, in youth separated from father
and mother, walking and walking, braving much dew, tortoiseshell ornaments on my head, colorful silk cords on my feet, completely—"

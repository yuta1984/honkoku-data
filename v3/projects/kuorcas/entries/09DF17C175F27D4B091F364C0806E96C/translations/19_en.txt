They came to the gate and asked, "Is Hayano Kanpei at home?" "We are Hara Goemon and Chizaki Yagoro. We have come to meet with him."

Hearing this, Kanpei thought to himself, "Their timing is not good. There's no choice." He arranged his clothes and, bowing deeply as if striking his head against the ground, welcomed them saying:

"For you two gentlemen to come to such a filthy thatched house, I am overwhelmed with gratitude." So saying, he bowed his head in greeting.

Goemon said, "It seems there is some urgent matter happening in your house."

Kanpei replied, "There are just some trivial household matters. Please don't be concerned. Please come inside." "If that's the case, let us go inside."

Seeing them sit down, Kanpei immediately knelt before the two men and said: "Previously, I was inexcusably negligent in my attendance upon our lord. I have no words of excuse.

Kanpei cried out "Ah!" once, his heart panicked and his mind confused. His mother, shedding tears like rain, said:

"Because of your wicked heart, the old father suffered such torment. You should realize that heaven and earth will not help you either. Everyone, please listen! Father-in-law, in his old age, forgot about making offerings to Buddha and burning incense, and only sold his daughter to this son-in-law. This scoundrel waited for the old father to return with the money and committed such a heinous act, stealing the money. Truly, with Heaven's oversight, how could..."

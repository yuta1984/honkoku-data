"So it was another person who killed my son-in-law!" she cried out in anguish, embracing Kanpei and said: "Look at you - I put my palms together and bow to you. Indeed, in my old age and shallow thinking, I spoke many words of resentment. This was my misjudgment. Please forgive me. You must never die!" And she wept greatly.

[Upper margin note] Sending out Kampei is going too far

"any movements, teach me to report urgently by swift messenger," he had already seen enough to feel relieved. But I cannot figure out what his son Rikiya's movements are like." Kudayu said: "That fellow also came with his father and acts stubbornly, showing no restraint at all. It's rather suspicious. Tonight I want to test and probe their true feelings, and discuss secretly with you. For now, let's go upstairs and conspire together."

Just as the two men slowly went upstairs, a song could be heard from the main room:
　　　Hearts transmit heartless sweet words; Playing with lips, false flirtation already elicits pity
　　　Who knows the sweetness of shared pillows in the bedroom; All is just coquetry displayed before the customers

Just then three men arrived together. These were trusted retainers from the Enya household: one surnamed Yama called Jutaro, one surnamed Chizaki called Yagoro, and one surnamed Takemori called Kitahachi. Following them was a foot soldier surnamed Teraoka called Heiemon. They all entered the gate together. Jutaro said: "Brothers, this is the pleasure house where Yuranosuke drowns his sorrows, called Ichiriki-ro. Heiemon, since you were called here for some business, wait here for now." Heiemon replied: "I obey your command and await orders." He also called to the house staff, saying: "We have a request." The attendants came out, gave their greetings, and said: "What service do you require?" Jutaro said: "We have some business with Yuranosuke. Go tell him that Yama Jutaro, Chizaki Yagoro, and Takemori Kitahachi - we three have sent messengers repeatedly over these past days trying to get you to return home, but since you refuse to come home, we three have come ourselves. We definitely want to meet with you face to face to discuss business matters. We earnestly hope to see you. Please convey this message firmly on our behalf."

The listener said: "Oh, how unfortunate. Master Yura has been drinking continuously for three days..."

"Adorned in splendid dress yet having nothing, years and months pass without understanding, in the morning receiving the pity of lords, in the evening looking up to the favor of guests, sharing the pillow day and night in turn, receiving people's defilement through pleasure and misunderstanding, sadly the house that sells charm, forever blocking the path of chastity and righteousness, not allowing the sons of prosperity, to redeem the concubine with a thousand gold and let her go, sharing the same heart with you, swearing to bind with the firmness of glue and lacquer, quickly becoming a wife in your house, expressing all this hardship."

Heiuemon came running out and shouted: "Isn't this my sister?"

Katsukaji said: "Elder brother," and being embarrassed, disliked facing her brother directly, covering her face with her sleeve.

Heiuemon said: "Don't be ashamed. This time I returned from Kanto, and mother explained everything to me in detail. Together with your husband, you've fallen into a pit of fire."

Katsukaji said: "Brother, I'm happy that you think so. And let me tell you something that will make you rejoice. Unexpectedly tonight, there is someone who will redeem my freedom and let me return home."

Heiuemon said: "That's great fortune. I don't know whose help this is."

Katsukaji said: "It's old man Yura who will redeem my freedom."

Heiuemon said: "What are you saying? Lord Yura seeks you to become husband and wife? But I don't know if you originally had intimate relations with him."

Katsukaji said: "These past few days, only two or three times, he had me accompany him drinking, and there's no intimate relationship at all. He said that if I have a husband, he would unite us."

Heiuemon said: "Then does he know that you are Hayano Kanpei's wife?"

Katsukaji said: "He doesn't know. I also, because of the shame about father, daughter, and husband, haven't told him."

Heiuemon said: "Then I understand - he's a person without courage, only lost in wine and women, with no heart to avenge his lord."

Katsukaji said: "There is, there is. Don't speak so loudly," and whispered in his ear: "Like this, like that."

Heiuemon said: "So you really saw the letter?"

Katsukaji...

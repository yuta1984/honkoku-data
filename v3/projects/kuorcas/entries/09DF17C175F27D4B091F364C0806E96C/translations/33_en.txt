Kutayu said: "A sword is something that protects one's body and should never leave one's hand for even a moment. The fact that he completely failed to notice shows he's a fool - this is proof of his stupidity. Look at the blade - ah, it's rusted like this. It's truly a worthless piece of metal."

Ban'nai burst into loud laughter.

Kutayu said: "Indeed, we've seen through his character." He immediately called for palanquin bearers and had them bring a palanquin. The bearers agreed and brought it forward.

Kutayu said to Ban'nai: "Elder brother, please get in the palanquin."

Ban'nai said: "You are the elder, so please go first."

Kutayu said: "Then excuse me," and got into the palanquin.

Ban'nai said: "Brother Ku, you must have heard that Kanpei's wife Katsukaji was sold to a brothel and is working as a courtesan. Have you heard about this?" He called out repeatedly, but there was no response at all.

Ban'nai found this strange in his heart, and when he lifted the palanquin curtain to look, inside the empty palanquin there was only a single stone.

Ban'nai said: "What is this? Has Brother Ku turned into stone?" When he turned around to look, a voice came from under the veranda.

"Brother Ban, you ask about my palanquin escape stratagem? The sealed letter that Rikiya brought earlier troubles me and I cannot rest easy. My heart feels like lacquer piercing through a wild goose's beak, like a hook caught in a fish's gills. I will investigate and inform you later. For now, pretend that I have returned home - you follow alongside the palanquin."

Ban'nai nodded and pretended there was someone in the palanquin, having the bearers slowly carry the palanquin away.

Then they saw Kanpei's wife Katsukaji leaning against the railing of an upper floor, gazing at the scenery while thinking of her homeland in sentimental contemplation. There is a poem as evidence:

　　Leaving the imperial carriage, she paints new-style eyebrows; the spring trees of the roadside are like branches of Shanglin
　　Having ceased the words of Changxin Palace, she blooms into the flower-moon poetry of the emerald tower

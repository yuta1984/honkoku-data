"Speaking of proper etiquette, this is not a matter for official government gatherings."

Kutayu said: "Then please drink, and I shall offer a return cup."

Yuranosuke said: "If you offer a return cup, then I shall drink."

Kutayu said: "Keep pouring it full to the brim. I'll prepare some appetizers." He took chopsticks and served octopus from a dish.

Yuranosuke laughed and said: "Just as I was about to swallow the octopus appetizer with legs that I received in my palm..."

Kutayu restrained his hand and said: "Brother, you must know that tomorrow is our lord's memorial day. You should observe ritual purification from the previous evening, and shouldn't eat this fish dish."

Yuranosuke said matter-of-factly: "Of course I'll eat it. Have you ever heard that our lord was reborn as an octopus? Ah, you're such a boor. Think about it carefully. The reason you and I have fallen into disgrace stems from our lord's shallow-minded lack of judgment and resolve. I'm the one who has grievances. I haven't the slightest intention of ritual purification. When you've kindly provided me with fish dishes, how could I refuse to eat them?"

He consumed everything cleanly, like a gust of wind sweeping away lingering clouds. The scheming and cunning Kutayu was left dumbfounded and speechless.

Yuranosuke said: "With appetizers like these, how could one possibly not drink sake? Let's wait for them to prepare chicken and pour again. You should come with me to the parlor. Why aren't the geishas singing?"

He immediately stood up and left, staggering unsteadily, and in his drunken enthusiasm said: "I'm going to tell the flatterers and madams to get them drunk as mud, create a disturbance as a distraction, and go to the inner rooms."

Sagioka Ban'nai, who had been watching everything from beginning to end, came running down from upstairs and said to Kutayu: "I've already seen his true nature. Someone who eats meat even on our lord's memorial day - how could he have any intention of revenge? Quickly report this to our lord and have him open the gates of caution."

Kutayu said: "Exactly right - no defenses are needed whatsoever."

Ban'nai said: "Come and see - he's forgotten his sword here."

[Header] Though there is evidence, since the old man has not returned home, the family cannot obtain proof. The author wants to create evidence for Kanpei, but the proprietress doesn't know that Kanpei has the purse in his bosom. This is a miscalculation.

"I made a purse from scraps of this striped cloth single garment and took it with me. You should see him return wearing it around his neck."

Kanpei said, "Ah, what are you saying? Isn't that made from the striped cloth you're wearing?"

The proprietress said, "Exactly so. Isn't this reliable evidence?"

Hearing this, Kanpei felt his heart sink, and while glancing around at the bystanders, he quietly touched the purse in his sleeve - it was unmistakably striped cloth. Only then did he realize that the one he had mistakenly killed last night was his father-in-law, and he cried out once in anguish.

"Ah, beloved wife, you truly don't know your husband's inner torment." Then he said, "Because you speak so recklessly, there's no escape for me."

[Header] With no excuse to flee, even a warrior's courage fails him.

"There's nothing to be done."

His beloved wife said, "Is it really alright to let him go without meeting father?"

Kanpei said, "I saw your father this morning. He won't be able to return quickly."

His beloved wife said, "If you met father, why didn't you inform mother? I was truly worried sick."

The proprietress seized upon this conversation and said, "In all matters, one should inquire seven times before suspecting anyone. Since the old man's whereabouts are now known, congratulations! If there are still more things to discuss, she'll never agree to give up. With everything so clear, both parties at peace, if the old woman and old man go to Rokujō Temple to burn incense, let them rest at my house, and we'll immediately put the daughter in a palanque."

His beloved wife said to Kanpei, "I'm going there. My parents are elderly, and if anything should happen to them, I cannot escape a husband's loving concern. Moreover, father is always sickly. Please take care of him."

Not knowing at all that her old father had met a violent death, she only earnestly pleaded - how pitiable and heartbreaking this was.

As the ancient poets wrote well:
"Butterflies fly away, easily making people melancholy; enviously watching which garden has fresh rain and dew."

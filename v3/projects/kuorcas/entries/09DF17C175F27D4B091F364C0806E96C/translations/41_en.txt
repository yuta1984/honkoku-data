He came and cut, but could only reach a depth of two or three inches, leaving the entire body covered with wounds. Kyudayu collapsed and sat on the ground, immediately saying: "Brother Hei, good people, please both of you atone for my sins," pleading with hands pressed together.

Consider how when he was in the domain, he despised lowly positions and paid them no heed, but now he changes his expression and begs for salvation. Behold this shameless wretch who knows no disgrace. What can be seen is:

The traces where that purple rusted sword cut him piece by piece left no unbroken skin, and the spots of blood stains from this white iron blade cover his entire body. Last year he plundered his eastern neighbor's wealth, today he wastefully damaged the northern district's land. If one uses cunning as a means of livelihood, it becomes difficult to rely on flattery to avoid dangerous situations.

Yuranosuke said: "If we kill him here, it will attract people's attention. Moreover, since we're pretending to be drunk, let's take him home."

When he called for Yazama, Chisaki, and Takemori, the three who had been hiding in the shadows pushed open the sliding doors and came out.

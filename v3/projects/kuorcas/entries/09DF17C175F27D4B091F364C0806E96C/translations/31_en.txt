[Upper margin] This passage depicts two states of mind as clearly distinct as black and white.

A voice called out: "Brother Yura, Ono Kutayu wishes to meet with you."

Yuranosuke said: "It's been so long, so long. In less than a year I've aged considerably. My hair has turned white, my face has wrinkles, and I've grown old quickly. Have you come to console this wrinkled face?"

Kutayu said: "Great achievements don't concern themselves with minor flaws. Looking at you, you completely disregard people's slander and shame, indulging in pleasure quarters and debauchery. This is precisely the foundation for achieving great deeds and the spirit of a true man."

Yuranosuke laughed and said: "Speaking of solid matters, like cannons, like the righteous arguments of Confucian scholars."

Kutayu said: "Don't pretend to act the fool. Your truly dissolute conduct must surely be feigned stupidity with good reason."

Yuranosuke said: "Do you think I harbor thoughts of revenge?"

Kutayu said: "It must surely be something like that."

Yuranosuke said: "I've simply reached my forties, indulging in women and wine, listening to people call me a fool or madman. For you to recognize me as one who secretly plots revenge is most gratifying."

Kutayu said: "Does this mean you have no intention of avenging our lord's unjust death?"

Yuranosuke said: "Not even a hair's breadth of such feeling exists. When I handed over the estate earlier, I merely said we would die fighting the government forces in the capital - these were just honeyed words to comfort our lady. Since you took those words seriously, saying it would mean opposing the government forces, I immediately departed. We remained steadfastly behind, with no resolution for the longest time, just making excuses about committing ritual suicide at the grave, then secretly slipped out through the back gate. The pleasures I now enjoy are all thanks to your good graces. I can never forget the kindness you showed then. Why don't you also abandon such rigid attitudes and soften up a bit?"

Kutayu said: "So I too am a fox from the same den as you. Let me reveal my true nature and have a drink, Brother Yura. It's been so long since I've partaken of your hospitality."

Yuranosuke said: "Elder Brother Ku, if you speak of such refined matters as offering toasts..."

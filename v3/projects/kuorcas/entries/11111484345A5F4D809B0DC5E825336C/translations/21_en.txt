Come and go in and out《Going in and out》This is my longtime home《This is our family of many years》Frequently coming and going《Regularly entering and leaving》

A stranger《An unfamiliar person》A trusted friend《A friend who knows one's heart》Someone known at first sight《A person recognized immediately》

Disguise oneself as a woman《Falsely become a woman》This is not real《This is not genuine》It must be fake《It surely must be false》

Mistake false for true《Take lies for truth》Don't tell lies《Don't speak falsehoods》Pretend not to know《Act as if one doesn't know》

Speak falsely《Tell lies》Don't take it seriously《Don't regard it as true》Transform paper into brocade《Turn paper into fine silk by touching it》

When one speaks, it becomes literature《Words become refined writing》When one puts brush to paper, it becomes a composition《Writing becomes a literary work》Thus it becomes clear《At this point it becomes evident》

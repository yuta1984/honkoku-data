　　　　On Narrators
　　　　　　　　　　　Akira
　Nothing gives a more unpleasant feeling than inadequate narration—this is especially true for films that require at least some understanding.
　Narrators should be faithful to the title cards! Yes! That is the first condition of narration. But before that, I want them to fully understand the film first. Without true understanding, meaninglessly and arbitrarily interpreting and narrating films based solely on one's momentary judgment and imagination is grossly negligent. It is a mistake. Since narrators exist to help audiences understand, unless they themselves understand first, there is no way they can provide truly thorough narration.
　Inadequate narration ultimately means being unfaithful to the title cards. However, title cards are hints for the drama, not the narration itself. Moreover, being faithful to title cards does not mean translating them literally. Narrators themselves may not realize it, but we often hear narration in a unique narrator language that far transcends Japanese, which Japanese people can hardly interpret. Also, it is necessary for narrators to have a script. But narration done while clinging to it is always very vague and very awkward. In the end, we must cover our ears and appeal only to our vision.

This becomes a disaster. Such examples are facts that clearly prove that narrators lack sufficient attention to and understanding of title cards.
　Therefore, skillful narration means thorough narration that truly gives audiences sufficient understanding, and definitely not lining up beautiful phrases or extremely biased explanations toward title cards—it lies in thoroughly explaining title cards and giving true hints about the drama.
　　　　Sharp Suggestion
　　　　　　　　　　　Yutorisei
　Although there have been quite a few films released as moral lessons, they were all biased toward academic attitudes dealing with major ideological issues, with few that were popular or for the masses. Even if there were any, there were hardly any that were thorough and had strong impressions, but last week's "The Whispering Chorus" was truly excellent as a moral lesson and had sharp suggestions that were popular. There was nothing new, but the plot arrangement was skillfully done. The scene where John became disabled due to a freight car was particularly natural.
More than that, there was a scene so pitiful it made one want to cry. John, knowing she was his mother but unable to call her "Mother" due to his past sins, pleaded: "Honorable lady! I am starving. Please give me anything you can spare." The compassionate mother took pity on the beggar and stood up saying, "Follow me." At that moment, oh that moment! Unable to bear the overwhelming sadness and joy, he wanted to cling to her calling "Mother" but couldn't, and followed his mother dejectedly.

That impulsive psychological depiction was truly delicate.
　I truly wept from the heart at his reformation. I felt sorry for him, who hadn't committed any great evil, yet went to face legal punishment while keeping all sorts of complicated incidents in his heart for his wife's happiness. I was able to know for the first time the true skill of Raymond Hatton, who was responsible for this role, as well as the director who gave people such sharp suggestions.
　　　　As I Felt
　　　　　　　　　　　Yoshie Yu
　He is a criminal. He is on death row.
He stole for his mother, for his wife, for living—he stole just once in his entire life. Yet he is being tried as a murderer. Society curses him as a villain. Is his crime truly his own sin?
　He is a good criminal. But regardless of what society is like, regardless of his circumstances, his crime is a fact. He was mentally weak. His constantly whispering conscience was finally corrupted by the devil—at that moment he suddenly came to his senses and fled, ran, agonized, grew tired, and when he returned home crying, society was already looking at him coldly. Society was still cruel to him who had truly repented.
　His wife shed warm tears at the moment of his death. His mother saw him as a good criminal.
And his soul's whispers were chorused.
　The evil suffer and die, the good smile and prosper—truly words of resolution for those who suffer in heart. "The Whispering Chorus" is a magnificent film.

　　　Despicable Mr. Minami
　　　　　　　　　　　Shurei Mumejin
　After making us listen to so much nonsense, when I see his final excuse, what is this—Mr. Minami! In response to our carefully dissected arguments in the issue before last,
【Emphasis starts】he has brought almost the same abusive argument【Emphasis ends】.
　You ruffian should exercise self-restraint. Taking refuge in the literary giant Maxim used in that refutation and making such a reckless charge is extremely rash.
　Our criticism is wavering, delusional criticism—bandwagon criticism—flattering criticism? Such absurdity has gone quite far enough. Regrettably, our principles and arguments are not such cheap things. Criticism—criticism in the true sense—has never been attempted even once.
　When humans truly develop themselves as objects, human full value and efficiency appear. Humans who don't suffer are no good. Armchair theorists are no good. Humans who go against nature's rhythm are no good. Momentary knowledge accumulated almost habitually within one's narrow boundaries is no good. Superficial knowledge that rationalizes spirit with body is no good. People like you are the worst of these. My argument in the issue before last can be said to have been comprehensively quite ordinary.
　If so much can be said about such an ordinary argument, your suspicions, jealousy, and distrust are more than half-wrong. Not accepting that one's argument is overturned from the foundation—unable to find room for what should be said, saying "He is a vulgar patron, he cannot clarify his own principles and arguments, therefore he borrows the famous writings of genius saints to make them his own and is swayed east and west according to current opinion,"

in the last two lines, unable to think silently—【Emphasis starts】what regret is there in understanding, being thorough, and clearly stating?【Emphasis ends】Mr. Minami—you should cast yourself into the superficial, cheap realm of Asakusa art. You should be remembered, and people should forgive==not knowing there is a beautiful ray of light on the other side, you arrogant and pompous one—you transient being! You who deceive yourself, advocate your own art, rely on many powers and are complacent—you detestable art addict. I didn't want to write this article based on personal views, but I was so appalled by his ugly sense that I fired back one arrow in my busy schedule.
　　　After a Long Time
　　　　　　　　　　　Benijiro
　In the first scene of "The Rose of the Ranch," a church was shown with a pleasant purple tinted color to depict the peaceful village atmosphere. And I, who was studying Monroe's artistic decline to no small degree, discovered his poor qualities—that disgusting expression. What was that theatrical attitude! Though it was in the past, that was his true nature. Barryscale was confused by the somewhat different role but managed it safely. The one who shone brightest in this film was Mr. Jones, desperately fighting for his lover—and the scene where the two walked toward the church dreaming of a happy future was wrapped in a gentle mood.
　I want to say something about "The Whispering Chorus" too, but the plot was too complex for poor me to critique. In that fierce psychological portrayal, among the actors, Raymond Hatton alone stood out brilliantly, with such depth that we couldn't find freedom to comment.

　　　Through the Screen
　　　　　　　　　　　Seihōsei
　○We must express our heartfelt gratitude to D Theater for showing the films of master director Cecil B. DeMille in such rapid succession. Having been struck by new feelings with each film—"The Woman God Forgot," "The Devil Stone," "Male and Female"—I was delighted to gain even more satisfaction from watching "The Whispering Chorus." If you want to see his sincere directorial work, you should see this film to know its true value.
　○Human souls—the author's "whispers" seem to express the workings of the soul—when brought into situations where one finds oneself in extreme difficulty, the whispers of thoughts and feelings are generally dominated by "evil," with "good" only touching one end. And when whispers become a chorus, they form life's highest "beauty."
　○The wonderful adaptation by Ms. MacPherson, who penetrated such profound melodical contemporary social views and brought such thorough dramatic effects through just one individual's living conditions or psychological processes—ideologically, philosophically, religiously—was impressive throughout the entire film. Compared to his previous films, DeMille's efforts with different direction using double exposure, and his skill in creating tension in what could have been a dull drama, truly deserve praise. I just wished he had delved a little deeper into the depiction of fate when John, unable to forget his mother despite his miserable life, returns to his hometown.
　(D-bo says: How cruel, over 1,000 feet cut)
The true value of an Ince film largely depends on its last scene—like Hart's—so we must not neglect how much value was placed on this last scene with the extremely strong coloring of John's death.

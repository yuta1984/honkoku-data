【Upper section】
Wolf (ōkami)
Its mouth splits
all the way to its ears, sharp
is its howling. It can see well
both front and back -
such is this animal
Between its
toes it has webbed
membranes

Jackal (yamainu)

【Lower section】
Bear (kuma)  
It lives in deep mountains
On its chest is white fat
called the moon's
ring
A fierce
animal it is
Its eyes open
vertically, its paws
are like human hands
It always
eats
crabs

【Heading, boxed section】Winter Peony (Fuyu-botan)
【Outside the box】The flower colors include purple, crimson, light-colored, and large white varieties. The flowers, leaves, and wood are all smaller than spring peonies. However, early-blooming ones are large.
The colors are more beautiful than spring-blooming peonies. Both crimson and purple have a reddish shine on the leaves. The stems and leaf veins are also light red. From August, both leaves and flowers emerge, and flowers bloom around November. Some buds emerge but do not open. However, overall they are smaller than spring varieties.

【Heading, boxed section】New Year's Day Grass (Ganjitsu-sō)
【Outside the box】The flowers are golden in color, with many petals like chrysanthemums. The leaves resemble carrots.
The flowers come in single and double varieties, also in deep yellow or light yellow, and white varieties are said to exist. The flowers open in the morning and close in the evening. The same flowers open again the next morning. This continues for a long time. The height ranges from one sun to five sun, and by late spring they stretch to about eight or nine sun. They extend their stems and branches. The leaves unfold. They are present from New Year to February. They grow in mountain fields and valley bottoms. They were brought from Kitayama in Ōmi Province.
Also called Fukuju-sō (Adonis), and the Chinese name is Hōshun-sō (Spring-announcing grass). In China too, it is said to bloom from the beginning of spring. Because it is the same as the spring-announcing bird (bush warbler), it is called spring-announcing grass.

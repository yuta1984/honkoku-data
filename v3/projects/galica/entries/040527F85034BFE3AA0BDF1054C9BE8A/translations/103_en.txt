Jia Dan's Flower Manual says: Peonies are called "tree peonies" by the Tang people. Ou Gong's Peony Manual contains over ninety varieties. Also, Yi Province contributed nineteen varieties. Nowadays, the named varieties are even more numerous. Su Shi said: The method for viewing peonies should be in the morning. After noon passes, they become disheveled. These flowers should be divided and grafted in autumn's ninth month, and transplanted during blooming time. Shu Yuanyu wrote "Peony Rhapsody." Qiu Xuan wrote "Record of Peony's Glory and Disgrace."

【Outside the box】Peonies are supernatural among flowering trees. During Emperor Minghuang's time, tree peonies bloomed magnificently in front of Chenxiang Pavilion. One branch with two heads: deep blue-green in the morning, deep yellow at dusk, with white leaves. The fragrance and beauty differed between day and night. The Emperor said, "This flower is supernatural among trees," and bestowed it upon Yang Guozhong.

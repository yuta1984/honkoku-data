three types, with white mottled spots on leaves. Leaf edges are blue,
blue center is white, like light snow falling on blue-purple, more magnificent than flowers, hence
called leaf cockscomb. Red-flowered ones also have white-red mottling on leaves. July-August.

Ganraikō is called nishiki-gusa (brocade grass). Calling it leaf cockscomb is incorrect. This has no flowers
but forms seeds between leaves. Leaf cockscomb's flower form is like cockscomb.
It's in the same family as cockscomb flowers. Ganraikō is so named because it becomes magnificent when geese arrive. Leaf peak is in August.

Rōshōnen, also called Shūkō, Ganraikō exists. Two poems, one says:
"Flying geese come south, autumn of border grass. {{Ruby: Not yet｜frosted}} Red leaves already first grieve. Green
Pearl's banquet ends, returns to Golden Valley. Seven-foot coral, night does not close."

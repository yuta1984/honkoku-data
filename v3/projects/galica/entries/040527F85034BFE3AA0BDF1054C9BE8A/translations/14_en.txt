[Note: The character marked ■ could be "name," "kuha," or "kuro" - difficult to determine. In "Gahon Noyamagusa [1]" frame 6 (Transcription! Living Things Encyclopedia - Collection 1), it appears as "name." In Tachibana Yasukuni's illustrated "Ehon Noyamagusa 5 volumes" [1], published by Yanagihara Kihei, Bunka 3, National Diet Library Digital Collection https://dl.ndl.go.jp/pid/2569335, frame 7, it appears to read "kuha" or "kuro."]

○1. Copy of a letter from Ōno Kurōbē to Kubota Gendayū

I humbly write to you. First of all, I am delighted to hear that Lord Tosa-no-kami continues to be in excellent health and spirits. When I recently visited your area, I inquired about his well-being. I humbly request your continued favorable intercession before his lordship. Now, regarding the matter of Hara Sōzaemon, concerning the handover of this castle, he is asserting his own claims and plotting to form a faction. For this reason, it is said that he has gone to your region. This person is unreasonable and outrageous, so please be aware of this. I will contact you again later. With fear and respect.

Date　　　　　　　Ōno Kurōbē
To Lord Kubota Gendayū

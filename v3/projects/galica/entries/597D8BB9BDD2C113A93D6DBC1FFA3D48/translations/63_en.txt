Around the hour of the rat (about 11 PM), Kuranosuke came secretly without any attendants and said he wished to meet with Mataemon and would like to come to his sleeping quarters. Mataemon agreed to this. There, (Kuranosuke) expressed gratitude for the thoughtful consideration, saying he was most grateful for the messenger from Lord Tosa no Kami. Regarding this matter, he asked that his true feelings be understood. Concerning this, he said that news of Lord Kōzuke no Suke's life or death had not yet been clearly heard. He did not know what Yasui Hikoemon and Fujii Matazaemon, who are in Edo, understood of the situation, and the circumstances of (Kira's) life or death were unclear. Surely Lord Tosa no Kami would have heard about the matter of life or death, so if he would consider Lord Takumi no Kami's situation, he humbly requested that secret mediation be arranged. Mataemon replied that he understood the intention.

[Inserted in red ink] Kuranosuke said he earnestly requested this and immediately returned. The next day, the 25th, [End of insertion] early in the morning, Kuranosuke and Kurōbei came and reported that they had informed the domain retainers of the verbal message and humbly gave their formal acceptance. Mataemon departed from Akō on the 25th and returned to Miyoshi on the night of the 27th. On the 28th, he reported the aforementioned formal acceptance.

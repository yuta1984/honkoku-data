田中貞四郎 (Tanaka Teishirō): This man likewise [stole and] deserted on the same 4th day.

Today, the stalwart and single-hearted men among us number fifty.

Last summer, during the preparations for a siege, [several men] showed cowardice, but claiming to repent their past wrongdoing, Daigaku-dono employed various means regardless of right or wrong, went to Kuranosuke's side, bowed his head, clasped his hands together, and joined the ranks of our comrades. However, [he and others] were again frightened by this recent turn of events and fled in great cowardice. I record this here: Kasuya Kanzaemon, Iguchi Chūbei, and Sugiura Jun'emon. These men are wicked fellows. We should have struck them down and abandoned them this spring, but regrettably, we let them escape out of concern for public opinion. If you should meet with these men hereafter, please tell them that this is what was said [about them].

One: Regarding those who remained this time, there may be some who are serving to support their wives and children. Also, did not Okabayashi Mokunosuke, Fujii Matazaemon, Ono Kurobyoe, and Yasui Hikoemon appear? Are there no other confederates? When this was asked, Kuranosuke answered: "Although all the retainers shared the same feelings, among those who happened to be in Edo, this affair was suddenly undertaken, so they did not know of these circumstances, and since it was difficult to inform them from our side, many were left out. This was especially true for those in distant provinces. Regarding Ono Kurobyoe, he served in the same position as I did, but when the matter of Lord Takumi-no-kami arose, he was particularly at a loss. Since Lord Takumi-no-kami was someone he had truly raised and nurtured close to his heart from childhood, being elderly and having lost all composure in everything, he withdrew to another province before the surrender of the castle," he reported.

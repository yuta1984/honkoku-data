Yasuemon 《marginal note: 15 koku, support for 3 people》 was dispatched as an express messenger and returned to Akō on the 6th day of the 4th month. The purpose of these two messengers was nothing other than to bring back replies to what Tōzaemon and Sanpei had conveyed - there was nothing else of note.

○One: From the same day, many money changers crowded into the currency exchange office (fudasza), causing a disturbance, so additional officials and samurai, five or six at a time, were stationed there. Furthermore, the loans that the currency exchange office had previously made to coastal areas and rural districts could not be collected as usual, and since the reserve funds fell short of the amount of issued notes, from the 20th day onward, exchange was conducted at six bu [to the ryō].

○One: Hara Sōemon and Ōishi Sezaemon arrived in Akō on the night of the 19th day of the 3rd month at the late hour of the Dog (around 9 PM), and regarding detailed matters, they summoned the retainers to the castle to make their report. From Toda Uneme-no-shō-dono, Asano Mino-no-kami-dono, and Daigaku-sama, a joint letter was sent to Kuranosuke, Kurōbei, Tanaka Seibei, and Uemura Yogozaemon, which the two men brought with them. The contents of the letter are unknown.

The two men went to the residence of Ōmetsuke Sengoku Hōki-no-kami [marginal note: Hisanao, below Atago, 1,800 koku], stating they had come to report urgent news, and immediately entered through the gate. The two men proceeded to the inner entrance and requested that their visit be announced. The attendant came out and opened the sliding door to look, whereupon the two men appeared to be in strange attire. When asked "Are you the two gentlemen requesting an audience now?", the two men gave their names, saying: "We are retainers of Asano Takumi-no-kami, now masterless samurai. As you well know, Lord Kira Kōzuke-no-suke was the enemy of our deceased lord Takumi-no-kami. Therefore, last night we went to Kōzuke-no-suke's residence and accomplished our long-cherished desire. His head has been taken by our confederates and they have now withdrawn to Sengakuji Temple in Shiba. We have come to report this matter. We humbly request your guidance in this affair. Should there be any inquiries, our confederates can be summoned here immediately." For this reason, the two men had come.

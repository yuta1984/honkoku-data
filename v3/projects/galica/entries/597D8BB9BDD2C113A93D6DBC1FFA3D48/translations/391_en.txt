Regarding carrying weapons without restraint, Kuranosuke stated: "That is correct. Since our confederates have always been numerous, it would be difficult to divide them. Moreover, with only five or seven men, we believed it would be impossible to accomplish our purpose even if we entered. Long weapons are what samurai should carry. This is also to achieve our earnest desire when facing large numbers. As a sign of our reverence for authority, we did not wear armor or bring firearms. Regarding killing many people, we had agreed beforehand to avoid such things, but they surrounded and defended their master, opposing us as enemies. This became an obstacle to striking down the main target, which is why things went as described. As proof that we did not deliberately kill from our side, we did not deliver a fatal blow to a single person. We merely struck them down and subdued them to the point where they could not fight back," he reported.

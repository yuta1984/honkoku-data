Though I have not yet had the honor of your acknowledgment, I write this letter to you. First, regarding your lord's matter, it was such an unexpected occurrence that I have no adequate words to express my condolences from beginning to end. Concerning this matter, regarding Kagakuji Temple, as it is the resting place of your ancestors' memorial tablets, I was feeling uncertain about how the succession would be arranged this time. Previously, I had sent word to Elder Ekō that since this concerns your ancestors, it would be of utmost importance to continue [the temple] with sincere devotion for perpetuity. I understand that you have shown great consideration and have arranged for the donation of rice fields and other properties. This is most appropriate. This time, you sent both a letter and documents regarding the rice fields to Kyūgakuji Temple, which were promptly delivered to our temple. Having understood everything in detail, I am increasingly relieved that Kagakuji Temple will continue in perpetuity. I am truly impressed by this wise retainer's efforts. Henceforth, I will ensure that all matters are communicated from here without negligence, so that the temple's prosperity and Buddhist teachings may be practiced in truth. Please do not worry about this. With respect, [this letter is] incomplete

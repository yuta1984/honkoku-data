Graffiti/Anonymous writings
　　　Although this book contains numerous anonymous writings,
　　　since the circumstances are complex and many of their meanings are unclear,
　　　I exclude these and select only the appropriate ones among them to record below
○Kōzuke-no-suke, suffering from wounds and painful shame, alone was cut and falls into melancholy
○Yosanbei won't let good deeds go unnoticed; even if Takumi was cut down, his stipend doubles
○Does Kōzuke eat rice gruel? In the Asano interval, he was devoured by Takumi's retainers
○With Kira's roots blocked by Ōishi, there is no Uesugi to set things right
○Takumi kicks, awakening the eyes of frivolous warriors; even among the Asano there are those like Kusunoki

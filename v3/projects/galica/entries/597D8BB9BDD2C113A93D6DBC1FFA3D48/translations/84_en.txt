To take possession of the castle, Lord Wakisaka Awaji-no-kami, Lord Kinoshita Higo-no-kami, and the inspector officials will arrive by the middle of next month. Accordingly, when messengers were sent from the Uneme-no-shō side to each of you, I and two others dispatched from Edo will proceed to that place in the coming days. Although this is sudden and without prior notice, I humbly request that you arrange with the officials for lodging at town residences. I send this urgent message for that purpose. With utmost respect and humility.

were handed over.

One: Regarding the handover of the turrets, although the construction magistrate had been instructed to handle it, the handover was not carried out. When the matter of the keys was inquired about with the inspectors, according to their instructions, officials from the garrison went out beyond the rear gate and handed them over.

One: The remaining rice stores of 1,214 koku and 4 to were stored in the second bailey warehouse. On the 19th day of the 4th month, they were handed over to the retainers of Lord Kinoshita Higo-no-kami in the presence of the warehouse magistrate, using ledger records.

　　Regarding the above remaining rice, we had previously petitioned the inspectors about this matter. This time the inspectors asked, "Regarding the remaining rice mentioned before, do you still wish to petition as previously stated?" It is extremely presumptuous for us to make such a petition. As we stated initially, we wish to distribute this rice among those who are withdrawing from service. However, it is most presumptuous for us in our position to make such a petition. Your Excellencies

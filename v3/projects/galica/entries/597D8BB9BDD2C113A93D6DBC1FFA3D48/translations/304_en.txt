to gather and wait at the open area by the bridge.

1. Regarding greetings when, during retreat, personnel from nearby estates come out and try to stop us along the way:

1. Explain the true situation and say: "We have absolutely no intention of hiding anywhere. We intend to withdraw to Muen-ji temple, receive the official inspector, and state our purpose. If you are concerned about this, please accompany us to the temple. Not a single person among us will flee."

1. If people from the estate pursue us afterward, all personnel should calmly stand firm and engage in battle.

1. If an official inspector arrives during battle, only one person should come out from inside the gate to offer greetings. However, if the battle is still ongoing, the protocol is to offer greetings only after everything is completed.

Wi　Hidden virtue, receiving offerings at the grave
No　Placed there leisurely  
O　Is he a parishioner of the plague god?
Ku　Does he not think it regrettable?

Ya　Even after some time has passed
Ma　Gazing intently and shedding tears
Ke　Today too, sitting with a melancholy face
Fu　People must call this pathetic

Ko　With a spineless appearance  
E　Even his Edo residence is unseemly
Te　Scorned by all the people under heaven
A　What a wretched state of being

Sa　Indeed, because of his lineage
Ki　He is supported by the Kira house
Yu　But shunned by warrior retainers  
Me　He wears a troubled expression

Mi　Suffering through painful experiences
Shi　Yet his shame will never fade
E　Rather than preserving this cowardly life
Hi　He should drink poison

Mo　If he continues to live on like this
Se　Despised by people of the world
Su　Criticized and scorned, afterward
Kyo　Even Kyoto's judgment - the shameful Uesugi

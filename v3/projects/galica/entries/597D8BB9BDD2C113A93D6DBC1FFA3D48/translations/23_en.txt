During this time, Lord Takumi-no-kami shouted twice, "Kōzuke-no-suke, you scoundrel, I'll finish you off!" The other kōke nobles, who were positioned thirteen ken away from the scene, quickly rushed over, helped Kōzuke-no-suke to his feet, and took him out to the veranda of the White Shoin. Lord Takumi-no-kami was judged by the metsuke officials, surrounded and escorted by four on-foot metsuke, and confined in the middle entrance monk's quarters. It is said that Kōzuke-no-suke did not draw his sword in response. At this moment, Lord Toda Noto-no-kami called out loudly twice in greeting, "Lord Takumi-no-kami, you are in the palace!"

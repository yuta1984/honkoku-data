How fortunate! The mountain path to death is in full bloom　　　　　　　Tadashichi
Why should I harbor resentment for killing? My body turns to dust in a single morning　Kuranosuke
I only rejoice that I can fulfill my lord's will and long serve without fail as a retainer
Today there are no more words or grass to be found　　　　　　　Jūnai
　For what purpose does the dew form?
My sin surpasses others' Buddhist merit, or so　　　　　　　Chūzaemon
　The mountain wind misjudges Buddha's nature
Wait a moment, though there is no haste or delay on the path to death　　　　Kanpei

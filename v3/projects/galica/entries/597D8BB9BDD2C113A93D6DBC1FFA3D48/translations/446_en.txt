In the white sand of the main reception hall, an enclosure was made with light yellow curtains, and six tatami mats were laid out. First, Chikara came forward, and a real sword was respectfully brought out and placed in front of Chikara. The head that was severed by the kaishakunin was presented for inspection according to proper ritual. It was said that the remaining men should observe the beheading. The corpses were wrapped in light yellow futons as they were, placed in wooden tubs, and removed in order. Within the enclosure, three men—a squad leader, an equipment officer, and a stipend recipient—positioned themselves inside and outside the curtained area, wearing both long and short swords. The accompanying caretaker placed his long sword aside and wore only his short sword. When the inspectors withdrew, Lord Oki no Kami remained as he had been when first meeting, without taking formal leave.

Hirano Hanpei: This man not only fled but also stole thirty ryō in cash from the sale of Ōishi's household goods and is hiding in the small streets of Kyoto. This is unprecedented.

Okamoto Jirōzaemon and his son Kihachirō: These men spoke as firmly as metal and stone until recently, but when the crucial moment came, they defected. Sasa Kozaemon and his brother Sanzaemon: These men appeared favorable until recently, but upon hearing of the appointment of the new lord protector of Akō Castle, they developed hopes for new employment and defected.

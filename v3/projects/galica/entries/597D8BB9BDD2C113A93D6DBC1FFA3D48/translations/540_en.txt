Gazing at flowers and drinking wine, crossing through many years
What a time this is - the wind of dawn sky, frost and snow
　　　　　　　　　　Kimura Oka'emon (Sadayuki, 45 years old)

Who would have thought that through the way of the warrior we would encounter such a connection to the Buddhist dharma
　　　　　　　　　　Tomimori Suke'emon Shunpan
The cold tide's foam being torn away - what destination awaits?
　　　　　　　　　　Ōtaka Gengo Shiha

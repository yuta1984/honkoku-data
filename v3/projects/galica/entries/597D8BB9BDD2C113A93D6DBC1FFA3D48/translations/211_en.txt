Regarding the matter of Danemon, he was assigned to handle Ako affairs, and even if by any chance Kuranosuke were unable to surrender the castle [meaning that even if the loyal retainers met their end within the castle grounds, he had no intention of fleeing]. Kuranosuke also appeared to have this same resolve, which Danemon related to others. After Danemon returned and consulted on official business with Lord Yasazaemon and Lord Shozaemon, there was nothing to criticize about Kuranosuke's conduct thereafter. In every respect, he did not appear to be an ordinary person. He did not seem like someone who could be called simply "Kuranosuke" by his given name alone. He appeared to be a person who absolutely must be addressed as "Lord Kuranosuke," and there were rumors that people were impressed by his refined and thoughtful character.

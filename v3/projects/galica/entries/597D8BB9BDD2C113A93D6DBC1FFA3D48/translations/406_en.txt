Last night around seven o'clock, the neighboring residence of Lord Kira Kozuke-no-suke was noisy, so thinking it might be a fire, I went out to see. However, it actually sounded like a fight, so I brought my retainers and went out to the boundary to keep watch. Then someone called over the fence, saying they were retainers of Lord Asano Takumi-no-kami: Kataoka Gengoemon, Onodera Jūnai, and Hara Sōemon. We are from a distant province and do not know Lord Kozuke-no-suke personally, but using an informant as witness, they said they had just killed Lord Kozuke-no-suke and achieved their long-cherished desire. Before dawn, it appeared that about fifty to sixty people came out in front of the back gate. They seemed to be dressed like firefighters. It was dark and the details could not be clearly seen. I know nothing else about the situation. The above.

We have successfully submitted them. Today, the 11th, the magistrate who is departing from this place has also received the aforementioned ledgers, and several other village ledgers have been completed, so we plan to submit them within the next day or two. If there are no further concerns about this matter, we will complete all official duties and withdraw from this location. Please mention this matter when you have the opportunity. I will report on the details at an appropriate time.

First, regarding whatever matter, good or bad, that will be reported to Daigaku-sama, I would like you to promptly inform me based on your understanding of the situation. Since there will be no means to receive correspondence from Edo after this, I feel extremely anxious about this, which is why I am making this request. As I will be staying near Fushimi, if you hear any news about these matters, please send a letter to Kozaemon at Otsukaya in Fushimi.

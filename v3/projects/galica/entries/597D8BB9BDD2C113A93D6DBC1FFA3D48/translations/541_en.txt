Without the strength to split mountains - snow on the pine
In Musashino, flowers of spring blooming all at once　　　Shunpan's mother
Beyond heaven and earth there is only storm, even the thousand varieties　　　Kayano Wasuke
　Thinking that they wither in the fields where they once bloomed
Life and fate cut down in the blooming fields, life and fate　　　Same [author]
Though one may be slow to understand the way of this world　　　Kanzaki Yogorō
　One should still lose one's way even in the melting snow

　　Death poems composed before seppuku

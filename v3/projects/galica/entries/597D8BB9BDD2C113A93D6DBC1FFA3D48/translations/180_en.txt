from the moat embankment to the exit of the East Main Gate.

○One: Around the middle of the Hour of the Rabbit, the personnel for receiving the castle entered the castle, and the handover proceedings were completed. When Lord Awaji-no-kami and Lord Higo-no-kami entered the castle, Kuranosuke was to go out toward the main gate and Shōgen toward Shioya-guchi gate, but since the inspectors directed that they accompany [the lords] to both gates, it was arranged that Kuranosuke and Shōgen should go out to the white sand area of the main entrance. When [the lords] entered, both men went out to the white sand area. Afterwards, both men went to the Great Shoin where they had audience in formal seating arrangement. After the presentation of the Tatsuno retainers was completed, Kuranosuke and others who had been serving within the castle assembled at the side of Kawaguchi gate and all departed from the castle together.

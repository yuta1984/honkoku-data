This was reported to Kuranosuke and everyone else. We continue to wait and observe the situation.

Article 1: On the 19th day of the 8th month of the year of the Snake, Lord Kira Sahyōe was summoned, and Lord Kōzuke-no-suke's residence within Kajibashi was confiscated as requested, and in exchange he was granted Matsudaira Tōnosuke's main residence in Honjo.
　　Lord Hachisuka Hida-no-kami, whose residence was adjacent to the Kajibashi property, sought private counsel from a nearby rōjū (senior councilor), asking what should be done if a disturbance were to occur at the neighboring house. The response was that even if there were a disturbance at Kōzuke-no-suke's place, there would be no involvement whatsoever, and that he should firmly protect the interior of his own residence.

Article 1: On the 13th day of the 12th month of the same year, Kōzuke-no-suke retired as he had requested, and the family headship was definitely granted to Lord Sahyōe.

However, saying "How shameful this is," everyone laughed together.

Iroha Tanka (poem using the Japanese syllabary)
I　How now, Danjō, listen well
Ro　Old fools have gathered together  
Ha　To bring shame upon him, what folly
Ni　Hatefully showing rudeness to all people

Ho　With no one to praise Kōzuke
He　Building only a plain house
To　Not keeping distant watch - this
Chi　Must be due to shallow wisdom

Ri　Having no clever retainers
Nu　Being negligent and careless
Ru　Against relentless enemy revenge
Wo　Allowing them to act as they pleased

Wa　What a laughingstock he became
Ka　If he had employed many men beforehand  
Yo　For night patrols and guard duty
Ta　Even if night attackers came

Re　If the nobles had defended properly
So　Surely there would be no defeat
Tsu　But due to constant negligence  
Ne　Never dreaming of being targeted

Na　How shameful to disgrace his name
Ra　Violently ransacking the house
Mu　His corpse kicked outside
U　Alas! His head goes to Sengaku-ji

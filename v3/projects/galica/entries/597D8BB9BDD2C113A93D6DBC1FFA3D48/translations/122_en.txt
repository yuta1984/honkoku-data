Regarding this matter, the retainers' service to Takumi should quickly withdraw from that place, and the handover of the castle without delay would accord with Takumi's long-held intention of respecting the government. Though it goes without saying, it is essential that the gradual instructions be followed and that withdrawal be carried out promptly and peacefully. All members of the household should understand and accept this message.

Writing practice of scriptures with fingernails on decorative paper　　　Ōtaka Gengo
Even tea drunk among plum blossoms will be stormy on the journey to death　Same (person)
Ah, how joyful! My thoughts are clear as I abandon this body　Kuranosuke
　No clouds hang over the moon of this floating world
Having long intended to inform both my lord and mother　　Sōemon
　Hurrying ahead of others on the mountain path to death
The white snow that has accumulated in my thoughts for my lord's sake　　Chūzaemon
　If scattered by this morning's pine wind from the peaks
Even if people in this world are slow to know and distinguish the way　Kanzaki
　They should still lose their way in the melting snow

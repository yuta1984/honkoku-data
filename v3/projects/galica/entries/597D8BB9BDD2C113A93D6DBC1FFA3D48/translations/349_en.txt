Everyone returned to prepare torches and other items within the mansion, and then all together withdrew to Mueniji Temple. Not a single person resembling a pursuer was seen, and the mansion was completely quiet with no human presence.

〇One: We proceeded to Mueniji Temple, knocked on the gate to wake the gatekeeper, and through the gatekeeper conveyed the above circumstances, requesting to enter the temple grounds to rest. The gatekeeper said he would inform the head priest, and after going inside to speak with the head priest, he returned with the reply that according to temple regulations, except for deceased parishioners, no passage was permitted from 6 PM to 6 AM, and entry by outsiders was prohibited, so we should depart to wherever we wished. We made another request but were refused and turned away, so following their wishes, we proceeded to Ryogoku Bridge, where we all gathered and waited for the Uesugi family's forces. Dawn broke before long.

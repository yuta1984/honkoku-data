So they searched with the butt end of a spear. At that moment, one person came out from inside with his sword drawn and fought extremely fiercely, but they surrounded him and struck him down. They also shot arrows from a half-bow into the interior. "Was that all?" they were asked. Both men answered with smiles: "We also threw out charcoal, tea bowls, and other items." During this time, another person came out slashing, so Majūjirō brought a hand candle to look, and saw there was a person on top of a long storage chest. Above were a tea jar and Aya-shima fabric, and below he was wearing a white under-kimono, nightclothes, and an obi sash. "Surely this cannot be Lord Kōzuke-no-suke," they all gathered around and called out in unison, "Tell us where your master is!" But he remained silent, so Takebayashi Tadashichi thrust at his face with a spear. This charcoal storage room appeared to be used as a storage area. When asked "Do you all remember Kōzuke, did he draw his short sword, what about his long sword?" they replied: "His long sword was in what we believe to be his living quarters."

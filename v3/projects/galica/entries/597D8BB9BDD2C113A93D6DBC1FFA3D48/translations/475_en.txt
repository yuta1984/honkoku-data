1. Nakamura Kansuke traveled back and forth to Edo to plan the undertaking.

1. Chikamatsu Kanroku changed his name to Mori Seisuke and traveled between Akō and Edo to plan the undertaking and achieve merit. He showed compassion even to his servants and appeared to be a warrior of feeling. A retainer named Jinshichi watched over him from beginning to end until the night of the attack, it is said. Being wealthy, he sent Jinshichi fifty ryō in gold along with other keepsakes. He was wounded in the fingers of both hands, and when ordered to receive medical treatment at Lord Hosokawa's residence, he accepted treatment for his right hand but refused treatment for his left hand, saying that since he would soon be a decaying corpse, treatment was unnecessary.

1. Yoshida Chūzaemon changed his name to Sasahara Tahyōe, and also changed it to Taguchi Kazumi. He achieved the same merit as Kanroku. He commanded a group and perhaps because he was usually compassionate, an ashigaru (foot soldier) named Terasaka Kichiemon is said to have joined the pledge, claiming he would watch over this Chūzaemon.

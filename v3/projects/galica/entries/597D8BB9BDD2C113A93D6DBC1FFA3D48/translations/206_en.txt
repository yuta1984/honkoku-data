○1. On the 19th day of the 4th month, the metsuke (inspectors) told Kuranosuke that now that today's castle handover has been completed, those other than the handover officials have no duties and should withdraw at their discretion. For those under the daikan (local administrators) who have duties, they should show in writing who will remain. As for yourself, since you still have duties, you should remain.

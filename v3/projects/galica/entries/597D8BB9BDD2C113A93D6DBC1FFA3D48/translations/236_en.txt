At that meeting, he acknowledged what had been discussed with Jōemon yesterday and gave assurance that instructions would be given within two or three days. Furthermore, around the 18th, Kuranosuke should go to Lord Shinzaemon to make his report. As mentioned before, this matter was not something we inquired about privately from our side, but rather something that came up from their side regarding Kurōbei. His various actions have been extremely improper and beyond what is acceptable for a person. First of all, he has not performed his official duties for the government, and unlike ordinary people, his abandonment of his post as someone in an official position constitutes improper conduct toward his superiors. Therefore, the family council should certainly take action against him, and his household property should be confiscated - this is what Lord Shinzaemon and Lord Shōdayū have been saying, according to what Jōemon privately reported.

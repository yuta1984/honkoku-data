...came and while eating soba noodles, he told me in conversation: "Two or three days ago I returned my shop and am now without lodging. Therefore, I am getting by with udon and soba noodles as my meals." I asked him, "What circumstances led you to close your shop?" He replied, "My master's younger brother, Daigaku-dono, has been pardoned from house arrest and placed under the custody of Aki-no-kami-dono. With this, I have no one to rely upon, and moreover, with high rent and only peddling cheap tobacco, it is quite difficult to make a living. Therefore, I consulted with close associates and decided to return to Akō tomorrow morning. Since it is my hometown, there are those who say I can make a living there somehow." Regarding this, he said, "Since the ice melts during the day making the roads bad, I will prepare for the journey during the night and depart tonight at the ninth hour (around midnight). Please prepare udon and soba noodles for sixty people and have sake ready as well."

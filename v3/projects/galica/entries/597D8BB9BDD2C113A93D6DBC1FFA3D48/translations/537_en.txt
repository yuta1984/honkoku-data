　From the time of our past parting, I told you repeatedly that you must not think of your mother as still living, but you have returned again to mourn me—this is a misfortune that resembles filial piety.

This too may be a way of loving one's child—with such single-minded feminine resolve I have come to this decision. With respect.
　　　　　November 6th　　　　　　Mother

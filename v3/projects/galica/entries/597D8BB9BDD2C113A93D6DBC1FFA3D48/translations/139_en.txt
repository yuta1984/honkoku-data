So [Yasōemon] went to Kurōbei's younger brother Itō Goemon and conveyed: "Kurōbei-dono apparently stated in the castle that I owed him money from card gambling. I went to his residence to ascertain the truth of this matter, but with such circumstances, he would not meet with me. Please understand the situation accordingly." After that, Kurōbei secretly departed on the night of the 11th day of the 4th month together with his son Gunemon.

One: Hagiwara Hyōsuke and his younger brother Gizaemon are well-off financially and are well-known wealthy individuals in the neighboring provinces. These brothers possessed large cannons, but before the dispersion [of the Akō retainers], they sold these cannons to Lord Wakisaka Awaji-no-kami. When the samurai learned of this, they considered it improper behavior. This matter has been transmitted even to the foot soldiers, who say: "What deplorable conduct! Selling [weapons] to Lord Wakisaka, whom we currently regard as an enemy, is extremely improper."

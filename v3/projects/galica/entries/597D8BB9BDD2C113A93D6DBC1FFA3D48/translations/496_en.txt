was read aloud. After the formal statement, Kuranosuke took out an aiguchi (short sword) from his bosom, drew it, and placed it on the upper tier of the stone monument with the hilt facing the stone pagoda. Then Kuranosuke was the first to announce his name and offer incense. He took the aiguchi and touched it three times to Lord Kōzuke-no-suke's head before withdrawing. The remaining men also announced their names one by one and completed the incense offering. Then Kuranosuke read the formal statement aloud. The remaining men prostrated themselves at the gravesite. When he finished reading the statement, they all wept together. After this was completed, they brought the head to the main hall and said to the priest: "This head is no longer needed. Though he was our lord's enemy, we bear no personal grudge against him. To defile the head of one from such a distinguished high-ranking family is utterly inexcusable. Since this concerns religious matters, please handle it appropriately."

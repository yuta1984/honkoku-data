One: Eight straight spears, six cruciform spears, seven sickle spears, two long swords, four concealed swords
　　《Marginal note: However, these are swords with handles attached》The aforementioned twenty-seven weapons were brought to Sengakuji Temple.

○One: When everyone entered through the mountain gate, Hara Sōzaemon said, "This temple has gates in three locations, so please be aware of this." From there they went to the grave site, and when the matter was finished, they gathered in the monks' quarters and corridors to the left of the main hall, changing into straw sandals. Should strike forces come from the Uesugi family at any moment, they gave orders to everyone to remain vigilant. During this time, one or two men took turns standing guard over the head at the grave site. Gruel and such were brought out from the abbot's quarters, and charcoal fires were lit for them to warm themselves. While everyone was lying down resting from the previous night's exhaustion, Ōishi Chikara came out and said, "Do not lie down in an undisciplined manner," so everyone complied with his instruction.

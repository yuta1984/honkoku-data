If you could make arrangements, it would be delivered promptly. I have also instructed Kozaemon accordingly and asked him to ensure it arrives without delay. After that, I will deliberately refrain from any actions and will not inquire about your well-being. On this occasion, I have asked Inoue Gozaemon-san for his assistance, and I would like to receive your opinion on the aforementioned matter. With utmost respect and humility.

May 11th　　　　　　Oishi Kuranosuke
To Sugiura Tohei-sama　　Retainer of Lord Asano Mino-no-kami
To Maeda Ichiemon-sama

○First, [Kuranosuke] sent a letter to Fumon-in temple in Kyoto. Hara Soemon took it there, but it was not delivered and he brought it back. This shows Kuranosuke's sincere devotion and thoughtfulness.
【The aforementioned Fumon-in is located in Rokuhara, Kyoto, and since the abbot of Enrin-ji temple in Ako serves there, this connection exists. Later he became the abbot of Enryu-ji temple, which serves Aiganji temple in Edo】

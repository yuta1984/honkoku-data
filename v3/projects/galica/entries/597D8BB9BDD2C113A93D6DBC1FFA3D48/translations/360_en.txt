Terasaka Kichiemon
The above document was delivered by Kuwana Buzaemon, who received it and immediately reported to Lord Hōki no Kami. Since it was before five o'clock in the morning, His Lordship had not yet reported for duty. Therefore, he immediately put on his hakama and haori, wore his sword, and appeared at the inner entrance with two retainers accompanying him on either side. He inquired, "Are you the two men, the rōnin Chūzaemon and Sukeemon, retainers of Lord Asano Takumi no Kami?" They replied, "We are indeed those men. We are most grateful that you have come out immediately to meet us, which we consider a most fortunate circumstance." Lord Hōki no Kami asked, "Did you strike down Kōzuke no Suke?" The two men answered, "We have indeed confirmed seeing his head." Having received the above document, I shall report to the Council of Elders and await their instructions. First, both of you should remove your straw sandals, come up, and rest while you wait. You may also repair your clothing as you see fit, and you are instructed to proceed to the reception hall.

○ One: It appears that the retainers of Akō harbor some rebellious intentions, and there are various rumors circulating in Edo as well. Perhaps for this reason, the caretakers (rusui) of Aki-no-kami-sama and Toda Uneme-no-shō-sama were summoned by Tsuchiya Sagami-no-kami-dono on the last day of the third month. They were told that "the handover of Akō Castle is scheduled for around the 19th of the coming month, and it should be carried out without fail." There was an informal suggestion that "it would be appropriate to dispatch retainers." The directive was to send a senior retainer (karō) from Uneme-no-shō-dono's side, and a chamberlain attendant (goyōnin) from Aki-no-kami-dono's side. Accordingly, Uneme-no-shō-dono dispatched Toda Gonzaemon, and Aki-no-kami-sama dispatched Inoue Dan'emon.

○ One: Following the visit of Itō Goemon from Tosa-no-kami-sama, Uchida Magoemon (marginal note: mounted retainer, 130 koku stipend) was dispatched as an additional messenger on the 28th of the third month. He arrived in Akō on the 1st of the fourth month and returned to Miyoshi on the 5th of the same month. This is a copy of the letter he carried that was bestowed upon Kuranosuke and Kurōbee.

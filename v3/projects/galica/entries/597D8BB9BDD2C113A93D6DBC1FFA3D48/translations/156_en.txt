One: Regarding the date when we heard that Akō Castle would be confiscated, we were never directly informed that this castle would be confiscated. On the 10th of last month, through a messenger from Toda Uneme-no-sho, we were informed that Tsuchiya Sagami-no-kami had announced on the 18th of last month that officials to take over this castle and both metsuke (inspectors) would be appointed. Based on this, we understood that the confiscation of this castle was decided. The express messenger who brought the confidential communication from the senior retainers staying in Edo arrived on the night of the 26th.

"Were you sent there? After returning, I wished to report to Lord Aki-no-kami to give him peace of mind, which is why I humbly make this inquiry." When he said this, Lord Jūzaemon replied, "I was just thinking of bringing this up myself, so this serves as a response. Regarding the circumstances of this surrender, the conduct and protocol of the samurai were carried out flawlessly. Kuranosuke handled [all matters] with great care, and both he and the magistrates performed exceptionally well. When you return to Edo, please convey this message appropriately." After this greeting, he went directly to Lord Uneme, who also received him. Before he could offer his own greeting, the other party said, "Today the castle has been successfully surrendered, which I find most commendable. Kuranosuke, [during this time] of great busyness, handled the detailed adjudication of matters throughout the castle and among the retainers without leaving anything undone. Following the death of Lord Takumi-no-kami, this is considered the foremost service to your clan members. When you return to the capital, Lord Aki-no-kami will be thoroughly informed of these matters. You yourself must surely feel greatly relieved." Such was the greeting he received.

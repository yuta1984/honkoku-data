The above matters were written down and handed to Kuranosuke, one of the two envoys.

One matter: A copy of the letter given by Lord Uneme-no-sho to Toda Gonzaemon, who was stationed in Ako when Tanaka Gonzaemon returned [Collection seal mark]

Yesterday on the fifth day, the Ako senior retainers sent a written message through two envoys, Tagawa Kyuzaemon and Tsukioka Jiuemon. The intent was that the domain retainers unanimously follow their lord, forgetting proper protocol, and lamenting the abandonment of Ako castle. While this matter arises from unfamiliarity with local customs and their single-minded devotion is understandable, since Lord Takumi-no-kami's long-held intention was to revere and serve the shogunate, the castle should be handed over without delay and [the retainers] should disperse quickly.

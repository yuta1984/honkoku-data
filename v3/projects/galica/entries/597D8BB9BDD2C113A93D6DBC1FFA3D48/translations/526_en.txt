"I would very much like to share a cup of sake." Kuranosuke acknowledged this as reasonable. However, saying it would be unseemly to show a disturbed appearance to Gengobei's retainers, he decided that everything should remain as usual, and we would share cups with water. So we drew water from the hand-washing basin, shared cups using tea bowls, and took our leave. Gengobei also took his leave, and we promptly departed together. On the road, Kuranosuke said to me: "From now on, consider that you have neither mother nor younger brother. Whether sleeping or awaking, focus your heart solely on taking the head of Lord Kōzuke-no-suke." From that time onward, I gave no thought whatsoever to my mother, thinking only of accomplishing our great purpose. When we achieved our goal as we had hoped, I was filled with great joy. Now I think of nothing else, caring only about how we meet our end. Since you asked about my mother, I recalled these events and have related them to you.

One: When asked "What did you do with the document written during the night?" both men answered, "We wrote it at a teahouse in front of Ekoin Temple."

One: When asked "Which one is Oishi Chikara?" he came forward from the fifth or sixth seat saying "It is I." When asked his age, Chikara said he had turned fifteen. His build was large, his appearance healthy, and though his voice was still that of a youth, his form appeared that of a big man, and he had already undergone his coming-of-age ceremony. The assembled company praised his fine appearance. When asked if Chikara resided in Edo, he answered "I am staying in my home province." At that time, Chuuzaemon said, "My ashigaru [foot soldier] called Terasaka Kichiemon went to Lord Kozuke-no-suke's gate the night before, but could not see him. No one was seen within the gate. Therefore, there were sixteen men," he reported.

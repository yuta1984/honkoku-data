it would be difficult to accomplish, so they again reasoned earnestly with Kuranosuke. Kuranosuke replied, "You gentlemen of recent devotion,
it is not that I am unwilling to join you. However, the extinction of our lord's family line would be the greatest disloyalty." The two men said, "Our lord's
irreplaceable life was lost, our hereditary house was abandoned to dispel his resentment - do you speak thus? Even if Daigaku-sama's family line were restored without fail and he were granted additional lands extending to China and India, could you appear before people without having taken Kōzuke-no-suke-dono's head? Please, by all means, resolve yourself to this course." Kuranosuke said, "As I stated initially, we have submitted our petition, and how can we act without seeing whether it will be approved or denied? Moreover, life's span is unpredictable - if Kōzuke-no-suke-dono dies of illness, we would have to attack his son Sabyōe-dono instead. Leave this matter to me, and first go down to Edo and wait for the right moment," he explained in various ways. The two men also felt reassured, thinking in their hearts that even if they delayed a little, they could still achieve their heart's desire, so the two went down to Edo together. Subsequently, numerous letters were exchanged back and forth.

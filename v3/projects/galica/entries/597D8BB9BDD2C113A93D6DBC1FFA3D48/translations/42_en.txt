The above appointments were so ordered.

○ Regarding the matter of Kusakabe Sanjūrō, due to his connections with Lord Takumi-no-kami, he was dismissed, and in his place, Sakakibara Uneme was appointed.

○ At the Tsukiji residence, Kataoka Gengorōemon and other retainers gathered and expressed concern about the hasty handover of the residence. Since we are already in such times, and this matter is equivalent to that of the castle grounds, they discussed wanting to properly confirm the life or death of Lord Kōzuke-no-suke before proceeding with the handover. They would certainly have conveyed this intention to the senior retainers as well, but perhaps it did not go as hoped, as the handover was completed on the 17th.
　　　　　　After this, various tools and equipment from the storehouse were gradually moved to the temporary warehouse in Honjo.

○ On the same 17th day, handover was made to Okuda Hachirōemon, the Tsukiji Construction Magistrate (2,500 koku).

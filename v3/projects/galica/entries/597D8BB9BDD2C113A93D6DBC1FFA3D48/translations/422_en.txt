...one person was stabbed to death. Since there were only two of us, we were no match for them, so we remained where we were. However, I could not identify who they were. We have nothing else to report. The above is all.

1. Testimony of Sabē-dono's group leader and servants:
　　　　Yesterday on the night of the 14th, after the eighth hour, a large group of unknown persons forced their way into the mansion compound and
　　　　stationed themselves at the entrance to the room where we were staying, preventing us from going outside. Therefore, we have no idea who came.
　　　　One person died, three were wounded. We do not know how these men went out to confront the attackers either.
　　　　We have nothing else to report. The above is all.

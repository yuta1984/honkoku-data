I shall go ahead and guide the way

One: When Onodera Jūnai traveled down from Kyoto to Edo accompanied by Chikara, at Hakone
　he met a friend and sent a letter to his wife in Kyoto, within her reply　Wife
　　Seeing the traces of your brush, tears of autumn rain come
　　　I have no words to say in return
　　　　Jūnai's reply to the above
　　Even on this journey with a set limit for my return
　　　I still long for the ninefold palace
One: The aforementioned Jūnai's wife, on the 18th day of the 7th month of Genroku 16, year of the sheep, at Honkoku-ji temple in Kyoto (committed suicide)
【Note: The character appears to be "東" (East) but based on the temple name where Onodera Jūnai's wife committed suicide, it is thought to be "本" (Hon).】

○1. Regarding Kuranosuke and others staying in Akō who harbored certain intentions, their sentiments were conveyed through two messengers, Tagawa Kyūzaemon (400 koku) and Tsukioka Jirō-uemon (300 koku), to the inspectors Lord Araki Jūzaemon and Lord Sakakibara Uneme in the form of a written statement expressing their grievances. A copy follows:

"Regarding the matter that Lord Takumi-no-kami was ordered to commit seppuku due to an unexpected breach of conduct, and consequently had his castle domain confiscated, all members of our domain humbly acknowledge this. Concerning the proceedings of that day, we humbly acknowledge up to the point where Lord Suzuki Gen'gorō-uemon conveyed the orders to the senior retainers who were in Edo, and subsequently the orders conveyed by Lord Tsuchiya Sagami-no-kami through Lord Toda Uneme-no-shō and Lord Asano Mino-no-kami. Lord Takumi was ordered to commit seppuku after the death of his opponent, Lord Kōzuke-no-suke."

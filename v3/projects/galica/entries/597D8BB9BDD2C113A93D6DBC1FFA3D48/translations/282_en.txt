When Lord Ise-no-kami heard that [Sanpei] had become a rōnin due to his lord's misfortune and was living at Shichirōemon's place, he said, "I will recommend you anywhere and take care of your livelihood, so until then, please serve Lord Ise-no-kami." Both parents received this proposal with great joy and conveyed this to Sanpei, but he declined, saying, "I believe it would be against my principles to change masters so soon after Lord Takumi-no-kami's misfortune. Moreover, I have certain thoughts on the matter, so please excuse me for now." However, perhaps because both parents had grown old and frail, they would not accept his refusal, and it seemed they had more or less given their consent to Lord Ise-no-kami. Under these circumstances, Sanpei considered various options, but he was in the midst of waiting for the right moment regarding Kuranosuke's group's plans. Now, this matter of service became urgent, and perhaps he thought that if he could just fulfill his sense of honor as a samurai, the matter would be resolved. On the 14th day of the 4th month of Genroku 15 [1702], pressed between loyalty and filial piety, he committed suicide. Whether this should be called an admirable act or not, many who heard of it praised him.

The above account comes from Andō Genemon, a retainer of Lord Matsudaira Oki-no-kami, who had custody of Ōtaka Gengo. When questioned afterward, he would not speak of it at all. Later, through Sasari Uemon's connections with Ochiai Yozaemon, with whom he was on friendly terms, and moreover since it would likely reach [his lord's] ears, he requested to hear the story. Upon being told "So that is how it was," he related the above account exactly as it happened.

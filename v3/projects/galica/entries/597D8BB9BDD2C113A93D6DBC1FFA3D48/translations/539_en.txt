raised my servants, and spent the years with no other desire than for his benevolent favor. Now I step upon white blades, resolve to die with certainty, and wish to avoid bringing shame to the duty between lord and retainer. What greater happiness could there be than this?

I entrust my body to the cold clouds in the east of rivers and seas
I devote my life to duty and righteousness amidst the dust of the world

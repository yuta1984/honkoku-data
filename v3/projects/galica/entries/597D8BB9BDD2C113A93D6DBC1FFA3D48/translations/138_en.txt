Since one person alone would have difficulty handling the matter, when [Kuranosuke] inquired whether one person from among the senior retainers, specifically from a hereditary elder family line, should be sent out, it was deemed quite reasonable, so Okuno Shōgen went out and completed the handover.

One: Regarding the circumstances of Kurōbei's flight, it appears that Fuda-bugyō (License Magistrate) Okajima Yasōemon had some financial dealings [debts] with him, and Kurōbei had spoken about this to someone in the castle. Upon hearing this, Yasōemon considered it improper and on the 11th day of the 4th month went to Kurōbei's residence requesting an audience. However, [Kurōbei] did not come out, claiming to be busy, so [Yasōemon] pressed forward to the tea room entrance, but the sliding door was barred and he could not enter. Therefore, Yasōemon said, "What do you mean by behaving in this manner? I have come here on business, so I absolutely must see you and cannot return without doing so," and pressed him insistently. However, [Kurōbei] made various excuses and would not meet with him.

might come to pass, and therefore we respectfully report this matter now. The above.

March 29th

Having received the above written statement, we departed at noon on March 29th and hurried as much as possible, but arrived in Edo at four o'clock in the evening on April 4th. We met with both retainers Yasui and Fujii, as well as Kasuya Kanzaemon and Shinagawa Yasuke, handed over the oral statement, and conveyed the intentions of Kuranosuke and others. However, since both metsuke officials had already departed from Edo, the Edo senior retainers consulted among themselves and brought the matter to Lord Toda Uneme-no-shō.

○1 Due to the return of Tanaka Gonzaemon and Yamamoto Saroku, a letter from Lord Uneme-no-shō dated April 3rd arrived on the 11th of the same month.

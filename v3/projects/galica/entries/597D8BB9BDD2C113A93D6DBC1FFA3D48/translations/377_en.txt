[The instructions] were conveyed to each [location]. Lord Matsudaira Oki-no-kami was ill and did not attend the castle, so [the instructions] were given through an official letter (gobunjo) as follows:

"Ten retainers of Asano Takumi-no-kami are to be placed in your custody. These men are currently at Shiba Sengakuji Temple. Sengoku Hoki-no-kami, Suzuki Gengoro-emon, and Sugita Gozaemon will go there, so send your retainers to Sengakuji Temple to receive them. That is all."

December 15th, Signed by the Council of Elders
To Lord Matsudaira Oki-no-kami

The above acknowledgment was completed. The official letter was sent directly from the castle on the afternoon of the 15th. The acknowledgment was immediately handed to the messenger, and the contents of the official letter were reported to the duty officer through a messenger.

They placed the ladders, successively climbed over the roofs and walls of the long houses, broke through the back gate, smashed it open with sledgehammers, tied up the gate guards, replaced the guards with men from the night attack force, and secured the gate. They struck the signal gong at the back gate, and when the signal was coordinated at the back gate, everyone lit torches simultaneously and began the assault. Those entering rushed into the mansion grounds without looking back, raising war cries from front and rear, making it appear as if hundreds of men were attacking. First, they broke down the entrance doors and went up to the main hall. At that time, four or five samurai on duty came running toward them, but they were immediately cut down, and the bowstrings of the decorative bows were cut. From there they went to the spear room and cut and broke fourteen or fifteen spears. At that time, a noisy commotion arose in the next room.

Those defending the mansion spread the word that "ruffians have just broken in and are attacking." Those with awareness had long anticipated such an event, but since twenty-three months had already passed, they had become complacent.

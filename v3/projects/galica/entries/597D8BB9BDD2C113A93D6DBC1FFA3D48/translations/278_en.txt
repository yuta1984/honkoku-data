While the message sent from Edo was quite reasonable, taking such action before Lord Daigaku's situation is resolved would ruin our cause. In that case, we cannot know what orders might be issued. If Lord Kōzuke-no-suke should die of illness in the meantime, it would mean our military fortune has run out completely, and at that time we would all commit suicide without exception. Even so, while this would not exactly bring disgrace upon our house's reputation, each person's convictions would be fulfilled. Since we have been holding back until now, it was agreed that we should observe Lord Daigaku's fate and decide on future actions accordingly.

Their residence in Edo was in Mita Matsumoto-chō, where they rented the mansion of one Maekawa Chūdayū, who served as a daily supervisor and handled official duties. [During this time, they occasionally visited to pay respects to Lady Yōzen-in.]

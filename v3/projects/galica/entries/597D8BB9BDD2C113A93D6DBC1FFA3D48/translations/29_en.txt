[he] is ordered to commit seppuku by His Lordship's will."
[Red annotation] This written statement is uncertain and not clearly understood.

○ First, Lord Takumi-no-kami's attire: underneath a white kosode, over it noshime hemp formal dress (kamishimo). He accepted the announcement, saying he humbly heard His Lordship's intention and was in awe.

○ First, three tatami mats were laid in the garden of the study hall, a futon was spread on top of them, and seppuku was performed thereon. When he took his position at that seat, about two sun of the wakizashi blade was exposed, wrapped in hōsho paper, tied with mizuhiki cord, and presented on a sanpō (ritual tray). He took the wakizashi, pressed down only the front of his kataginu, thrust the blade into his left ribs, drew it across to the right, and at his cry of "kaishakunin!", Budayū immediately performed the beheading. Since Lord Shimōsa-no-kami was particularly urgent about the seppuku, even the futon was only hastily prepared.

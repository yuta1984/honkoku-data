Due to reckless behavior that showed no consideration for time and place, which was extremely improper, [our lord] was ordered to commit seppuku and his domain of Akō castle was confiscated. Regarding this matter, all retainers humbly acknowledge [the situation]. We received the shogunal envoy's orders, surrendered the castle grounds, and the household immediately disbanded. During that quarrel, although there were those present who tried to restrain [our lord], we failed to strike down Lord Kira. The dying regrets of our lord Takumi-no-kami are an unbearable situation for us retainers. While we are deeply ashamed to harbor resentment against the distinguished members of the Kōke family, the principle that one cannot share the same heaven with the enemy of one's lord and father makes it impossible for us to remain silent. Today we have come to Lord Kira's residence. This is solely out of our determination to carry on our deceased lord's intentions. Should there be any officials who examine us after our deaths, we humbly request that this be reviewed. Such are the circumstances. The above.

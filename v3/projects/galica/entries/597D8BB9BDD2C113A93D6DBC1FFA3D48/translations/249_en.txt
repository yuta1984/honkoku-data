When I explained this to them, they said that if that was the case, they would go up to the Kamigata region and come back later. Therefore, I told them that even if they came a hundred times, we would not give them instructions. Consequently, I summoned Shinemon, the ōdoshiyori (senior administrator) of this town, [and explained that] people claiming to be from the Kamigata region had made this request. Although it is not our place to give instructions, since we cannot be certain what kind of deception they might be attempting, the aforementioned belongings should not be handed over. I instructed him to keep this in mind, as Lord Shinzaemon had ordered. I also consulted with Lord Shōdayū and reported the same thing I had conveyed to Lord Shinzaemon. Furthermore, regarding this matter, I gave orders to Andō Zendayū, Kanzaki Yogorō, and Yokogawa Kanpei to inspect the aforementioned belongings. The three of them immediately sealed and took custody of them, obtaining a receipt from the owner. The ashigaru (foot soldiers) who had been assigned previously were kept in place, the seal was returned to the ashigaru, and since this was reported to the代官衆 (magistrates) and left in their custody, I ordered that the koashira (squad leaders) be summoned to be informed that we had ordered a new sealing from our side, and summoned the townspeople who were keeping the belongings.

In the past, when I was staying in Kyoto, I became acquainted with the literary figure Bunpō Sanjin, and we shared
similar tastes in painting matters, never tiring of our discussions day and night. Upon parting, Sanjin brought out
his drawings and said, "These are not intended as gifts, but please take them
back with you for your children's amusement." I think that Sanjin's brushwork, while being most simplified,
represents his greatest skill. When viewing them, the former figures seem to be speaking, while the latter ones
appear to be laughing. The essence of conveying spirit in painting lies in the eyes, and everyone praised them while remaining seated.

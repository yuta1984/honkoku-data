Even at midday, the bird-chasers come and the New Year's door-to-door greetings are bothersome too
The alcove is decorated, sitting together, eating piled food with joyful cloth
Sucking mouths making slurping sounds, the lewd fluids dripping without cease
Cries of pleasure from both, as long as vigor continues, quickly now
Urging each other on, hips moving like ships, visible there, loading into the ship's soul
What treasures are these? Jewels in pouches, even the hair of straw raincoats glistening
Raising the mast, carried by favorable winds, take the helm - oh, again!

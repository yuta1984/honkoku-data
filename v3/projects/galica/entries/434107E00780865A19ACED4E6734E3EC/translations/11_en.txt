The broken night bedding and arranged pillows had become one, appearing to be put away. The koto, biwa, and flutes that had been played were all gathered together, and from beneath the koto's bridge, from under the biwa's plectrum guard, and from within the holes of the flutes, he lovingly retrieved papers written on thin paper. When he looked at them, they were in that person's handwriting. As he continued reading and looking at them, his tears would not stop at all, and his dwelling felt faintly sorrowful.

　How sad it is to endure these sorrows—the bamboo flute
　　At each sorrowful joint only weeps its sound

　If it is painful, may my heart too change

And this became the final farewell. When it was already time for departure, he called his younger brother to bid farewell, saying, "All the people will find this painful, but I alone, thinking of you as a keepsake of a person dear to me, find this deeply moving and regrettable. When you become a monk, you must not speak of this to anyone first. You must keep it absolutely secret." He said various things like this, then continued, "I shall go to shōkyōden (?). I say again, no matter what kind of world this becomes, I will never forget." After bidding farewell in this way, he returned to his own quarters. The younger brother saw him off, and though tears that must be hidden from others' eyes overflowed from his sleeves, he behaved as if nothing were amiss. Ayashi no (?)

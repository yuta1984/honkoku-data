According to the Dai Nihon-shi, in the early Tenpyō period when the monk Genbō returned from Tang China, the Emperor granted him purple robes and made him High Priest (sōjō), placing him in the inner chapel. The Empress (Kōmyō) showed him great favor and special treatment, but there were considerable scandalous rumors.
One can imagine the circumstances of those times.

Konakamura Kiyonori states that in the Shoku Nihongi, volume 22 (folio 28), it appears that Empress Kōmyō was granted First Rank, but this is an error. The proof is that in the same work, volume 10 (folio 5), it states "In the eleventh month of Jinki 4, Junior Third Rank Lady Fujiwara was granted a food fief of one thousand households," and in the same work (folio 23) "By imperial edict of the eighth month of Tenpyō 1, Senior Third Rank Lady Fujiwara was established as Empress." When she was made Empress, she held Senior Third Rank. △Since she held Senior Third Rank when made Empress, it is clear that the claim she was granted First Rank upon Emperor Shōmu's accession is erroneous. This is likely a mistake confusing her later promotion to First Rank during the Tenpyō Hōji era.

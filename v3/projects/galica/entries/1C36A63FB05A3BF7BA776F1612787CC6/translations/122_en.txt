Tenshō 13, year of the metal rooster, fifth month, died at age twenty-nine. 《It is said that if the Kunitane in the mirror inscription and Kunitane are the same person, then in Eiroku 12 he would have been thirteen years old when his father Tanetomi was thirty-nine. He had not yet inherited the family headship and should be called Chiba Shin-suke》《it is said》

Iōzan Yakuō-in Zenshō-ji Temple - Located in the same place. 《About six or seven chō northeast of Sengen Shrine》The Shimōsa Province provincial nunnery recorded in the Shoku Nihongi is precisely this temple. 《Compare with the section on Kokubun-ji》This is a sacred site, one per province, established in the Tenpyō era by imperial decree of Emperor Shōmu. The founding abbess is called Zenshō-ni. 《This appears in the inscription on a bronze plaque. The name Zenshō-ji probably derives from using this nun's dharma name as the temple name. "Zen" and "Sen" are phonetic variations of the same sound. ○The temple's restoration was carried out by the monk Ryūhan during the Taiei period》The principal image of Yakuō Bodhisattva dates from the Tenpyō period.

《At some point, the head priest, disliking its ancient appearance, sent it to a subsidiary temple called Shōtoku-ji and had a new one made separately, but the old image still exists today. It is kept as a secret Buddha and not easily shown to visitors》It belongs to the Shingon Shingi sect and is affiliated with Sanbō-in at Daigo in Kyoto. Currently it also serves as the administrative temple for the local Sengen Shrine.

《Upon consideration, since this temple's name has not changed and the bronze plaque was excavated from within the grounds, it can be inferred that the temple site remains in its original location》

In Bunsei 10, year of the fire boar, seventh month, during temple repairs when they dug into the ground, a grave marker was discovered measuring one shaku two sun in length, three sun in width, and about five rin in thickness. 《Upon consideration, the Kōchō Kinseki-hen records grave markers of Shi-ō of Funa○, with bronze plaques measuring nine sun seven bu in length, two sun two bu in width, and five rin in thickness, which closely resembles the specifications of grave markers of that period》

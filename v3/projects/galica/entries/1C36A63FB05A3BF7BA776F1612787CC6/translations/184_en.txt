[Details are] unclear. (Note: According to the Brief History of Tekona Myōjin, it was located within the precincts of Kamei-bō temple and is now called Kamei)

[Stone inscription]
Water jars may draw from it, but firm resolve - how could it ever waver?
Mama Well     Ah! This virtuous woman, like the water pure and clear
               Erected by Suzuki Nagayori with engraved inscription
               Genroku 9, year of Hinoe-Ne, mid-spring (1696)
               Recorded by Head Priest Nichijō

Meisho Ima Uta-shū, Volume 1 (51): "In Katsushika, from Kamei's pure water, even if drawn for ten thousand generations, how could it ever run dry?" - Shunkō

Same collection: "In the summer rains, no one draws water; in Katsushika, the water of Mama Well has begun to grow turbid" - Roan

Tekona's Grave - According to a certain text, it is located about one hundred paces east of Tsugu Bridge, with a single pine tree remaining at the grave marker. Later, a shrine was built nearby and called Tekona Myōjin. Every year September 9th is designated as the festival day. For what reason this came about - according to tradition, on September 9th of Bunki 1 (1501), the priest Nichikō (or according to another version, Nichiyo) residing at Kōbō Temple first established this shrine, and therefore that day became the festival day.

○ In the Tekona Besseki (Separate Record of Tekona) it states: "When exactly did Tekona drown herself in the inlet?"

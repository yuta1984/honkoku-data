○Regarding Sakazuki no I (Cup Well), there appears the verse "Though I do not think to come eastward following the seaweed and salt grass, I cast my reflection in Cup Well." This poem is attributed to Shimōsa Province in "Aki no Nezame" (Autumn Awakening), Volume 6. According to local tradition, this refers to a well within the grounds of Eifuku Temple in Shisui village (now buried and gone). Some say there is a Sakatsuki village in Chiba District, and this likely refers to a weir in that village, but since there is no clear evidence for either theory, it is difficult to determine which is correct.

This is probably because originally a person named Mondo (Master of Water) or similar lived in this area. Furthermore, in the "Kaichū-shō" there is a poem saying "Though the water channel's floating current does not flow away, it must be called Fumimaki River." This too is attributed to Shimōsa Province in "Nezame," and some say it refers to Monma River (namely, the Kokai River), with its character pronunciation read as "fumimaki" according to kun reading. This is similar to how Matsudo is written as "Matsusato" in the "Sarashina Diary" and Inba Marsh is called "Inaho no Umi" in the "Kaikoku Zakki" - likely clever interpretations. In this category, Shisui...

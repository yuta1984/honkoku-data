It truly appears as if within one's very eyes - a truly magnificent vista. To the northwest of Kōbō Temple stands Sōnei Zen Temple, an official temple. In the village before reaching Kōbō Temple, there is a checkpoint and a river, where the red cliffs on the eastern bank rise several jin high and present a splendid view. I toured Tsugu-no-sato with Fujitōheki in the tenth month of the year of Hinoto-Tori (1717). Since Tōheki's uncle served as a monk at Kōbō Temple, we lodged in his quarters before returning. I was already able to learn all the historical tales. I record this here. (Note: Some say this excursion took place in Kyōhō 2 [1717])

Inscription erected by Suzuki Nagayori (Note: Nagayori served as Nikkō magistrate at that time and appears to have been a Nichiren sect believer. His descendants now bear the title of Kaname and hold a stipend of 500 koku, residing at Yamabushi Well)

[Stone inscription]
The records of Tsugu are lost in antiquity, yet the writings and the bridge endure
Tsugu Bridge     The forest of poetry lasts a thousand generations, the myriad leaves never wither
                 Erected by Suzuki Nagayori with engraved inscription
                 Genroku 9, year of Hinoe-Ne, mid-spring (1696)
                 Recorded by Head Priest Nichijō

Mama Well (Mama-no-i) - Located beside a grass hermitage called Reikoku-in in the shade of the northern mountain of the same place. It is unclear whether this is from ancient times.

[Note: Rokumei = carving inscriptions into metal or stone.]

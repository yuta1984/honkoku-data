This refers to Chiba no Naritate. Naritate was the legitimate grandson of Tsunetane and the son of Tanemasa. <<It is recorded in Volume 1 of the Chigaku-shū that he was called Benga-tani-dono>>

○Two Types of Chiba Family Genealogies <<Although there are several types of Chiba genealogies, good editions are rare. From my observations, the Katori Tadokoro edition and the Suifu Shōra-kan edition are quite concise and clear. There is also a four-volume Kaburaki edition that is detailed and clear, but it does not avoid miscellaneous entries. Therefore, I have included the Tadokoro and Shōra-kan editions as supplements. As for their differences and merits, I omit them here as the discussion would be lengthy>>

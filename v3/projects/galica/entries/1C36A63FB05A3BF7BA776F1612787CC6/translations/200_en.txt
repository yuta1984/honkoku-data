Illustration of an Ancient Sutra Box (Kokyū)

This place was formerly called "Dō" (Hall). Among the forests and thickets, numerous broken roof tiles are piled up like mountains, but they do not appear to be from the Tempyo period. Foundation stones are also scattered in various places. Their massive size allows us to imagine the enormous expenses of that time.

Kaō: Takimi Kannon (Waterfall-viewing Avalokiteshvara)

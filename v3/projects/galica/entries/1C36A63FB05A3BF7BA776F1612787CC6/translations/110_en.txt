1. I include many ancient documents because it allows us to witness the actual facts of those times, and it is lamentable that these are gradually scattering and disappearing with the passing years. For well-known places like Nakayama and Funabashi, there are many such documents and little concern about their loss, so I select only the essential ones and provide merely catalogues for the others.

1. Citing sources at second-hand is not my intention, but when books are scarce, it cannot be helped, and in such cases I give the name of the person who made the citation. For research books that are largely similar with minor differences, I follow one book rather than citing multiple sources. This is because I consider that excessive detail would be troublesome for readers. <<My humble opinions are marked with △ to distinguish them from various other theories>>

1. To record legends for every single shrine and write origins for every single temple would be endless, so I include only what is clearly evident. For classical references that previous scholars have already cited, I do not mark the author's name for common ones, since anyone could cite them. For original ideas, even a single phrase must necessarily include the author's name, as it is important to acknowledge people's contributions. I temporarily set aside doubtful historical traces, strive to omit errors by predecessors, and do not favor disputation, for I fear it harms virtue.

1. This compilation draws extensively from "Shimōsa Kyūji" by the old man Tōin and "Hanyū-gun Meisai-ki" by Mr. Sawada, among others.

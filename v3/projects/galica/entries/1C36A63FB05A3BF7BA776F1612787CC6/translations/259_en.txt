When the saint had finished speaking thus, Jōnin listened intently to the discourse and said, "What truly excellent teachings these are! That Nichiren must be no ordinary person. First of all, you have remembered and understood his words remarkably well." After reflecting for a while in admiration, he thought about what kind of person this Nichiren might be, then said, "I had been wondering what manner of person this Nichiren was, but surely you yourself must be the saint Nichiren! Before the karmic connection with the Dharma in this world comes to an end, please guide me as well to the other shore [of enlightenment]," and began to form a deep spiritual bond with him. Even after disembarking from the boat, he invited the saint to stay and moved him to Nakayama, serving him with great devotion. Thereafter, whenever the opportunity arose for the saint to visit Jōnin's residence, he rejoiced at this blessing. Behind his usual mansion, he built an embankment about one hundred ken in length, and within it piled earth up somewhat high and constructed a hall, which was built as lodging for the saint. At that time, the saint himself carved the images of One Buddha and Four Bodhisattvas, enshrined them in this place, named it Hokke-dō (Lotus Hall), and conducted Dharma discussions for one hundred days. Thus it was that Jōnin took Buddhist vows after the saint's death and became known as Toki Nichijō, the founding abbot of Nakayama.

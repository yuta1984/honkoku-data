(In the Man'yōshū, volume 4, we see "hotoke tomo" (Buddha and), etc., and in volume 7, "nakeki seba" (if one weeps), etc.) Regarding Yashima, in the household register of Yōrō 5 owned by Hoida Tadatomo of the capital, it states "Shimousa Province, Katsushika District, Ōshima Village, Kawawa Village," etc. According to Tadatomo's theory, "Yashima" in the Wamyōshō is likely an error for "Ōshima." Ōshima Village is in the vicinity of Sugito, so this would be it (according to Ban Nobutomo).

(In Edo Sunago, volume 6, it states "There is Ōshima in Katsushika District, Honjo." If this is the case, then "ya" (eight) would be a corruption of "ō" (great), etc. Making "ya" a corruption of "ō" agrees with Tadatomo's theory, but calling it "Ōshima-chō" is questionable.) Nii would be Niishuku according to some, but it is likely Arai Village. In the area near this village in Saitama District, Musashi Province, there are Naka-Arai, Shimo-Arai, Arai-Shinden, etc., which were probably all one village in ancient times. Kuwahara has Kuwasaki-Shinden nearby, with Hongō Village (both now belong to Katsushika District, Musashi Province), so this would be it. In general, when searching for the locations of ancient villages, one should pay attention to the character "Hongō." Kurihara would be Kurihara-Hongō Village (there is a village called Kurihara in Saitama District, Musashi Province, adjacent to Katsushika District, but it is not this one). Toshima would be Tajima Village (now belongs to Katsushika District, Musashi Province). Yoko (I cannot yet determine this). Ekika (This would be present-day Niishuku. In the Naokage documents dated the 9th day of the 5th month of Jinba (Jinba is probably Tenshō 10), it states "From Edo Asakusa Kasai Niishuku to Usui," where Asakusa would be present-day Senju. Niishuku is indeed Niishuku. In the "Kō no Dai Battle Chronicle," [missing characters] inn appears. This would be Aoto Village. The name Niishuku would mean the Niishuku of Aoto).

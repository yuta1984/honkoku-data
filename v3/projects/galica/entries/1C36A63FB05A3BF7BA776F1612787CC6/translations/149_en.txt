He wore two hereditary swords of seven sun in length made of red copper, carried a great naginata from Hōjōji with a shortened handle, mounted his famous horse called Oni-tsukige with a nashiji lacquered saddle bearing his family crest and red tassels, making the horse foam at the mouth with white froth, and charged forward alone. Sasaki Shōfu Jirō and twenty-four mounted retainers formed up and charged out after him. Yoshiaki's horse had been presented the previous year by Lord Kasai of Ōshū as the finest horse in six districts - an exceptional swift horse of Sannohe breeding. Since his master was naturally an expert horseman, he advanced about one rank ahead of others, charged into the enemy forces, and trampled and cut down those who happened to touch his stirrups. Seeing that this must be the general, the enemy surrounded him from front and rear, each trying to claim the honor of striking him down, but since his horse was powerful and he was skilled with weapons, relying on his superior martial prowess, he fought with great swiftness, pursuing and cutting down fleeing enemies one after another. His own troops could not keep up as he charged into the midst of the great enemy force. Among the Odawara forces, a man named Andō appeared wearing rough black leather armor and a chain-coif helmet with a kuwagata crest ornament. He drew his great sword, held it aloft, fixed his eyes on Yoshiaki, and approached closer and closer.

Tanenobu (Ōsuga Gorō), Tanemichi (Kokubu Rokurō-dayū), Taneyori (Tō's legitimate grandson Kotarō Naritane), and others were assembled at the Shimōsa Provincial Capital, where the accompanying forces numbered over 300 mounted warriors. Tsunetane first summoned the prisoner Senda Hōgan-dai Chikamasafor inspection, then presented provisions. The Military Guard (Minamoto no Yoritomo) invited Tsunetane to sit at his right hand, saying that he should regard the Military Commander as a father.

Tsunetane brought forward a young man and said, "This one should be used as today's gift offering." This was the son of Mutsu Rokurō Yoshitaka, called Mōri Kanja Yoritaka. Wearing a dark blue muranō hitatare with light armor, he knelt beside Tsunetane. When [Yoritomo] observed his bearing, he was truly worthy of being called a descendant of the Genji clan, so feeling moved, he immediately invited him to sit with Tsunetane.

His father Yoshitaka had sacrificed his life in service to the late Sadaijūku at Tendaizan Ryūgakoshi in the twelfth month of the first year of Heiji. At that time, Yoritaka had been born only about fifty days earlier. However, he was punished due to this association, and in the second month of the first year of Eiryaku, by imperial command through Tsunetane, he was exiled to Shimōsa Province.

On the second day of the tenth month, day of Kanoto-Mi, the Military Guard boarded boats with Tsunetane, Hirotsuneand others, crossed the Ōi and Sumida rivers, and proceeded to Musashi Province with elite forces numbering over 30,000 mounted warriors. On this day, the daughter of the late Hatta warrior Munetane, who was the Military Guard's wet nurse (wife of Oyama Shimotsuke-no-Daijō Masamitsu, called the Nun Samukawa), came to Sumida station bringing her beloved youngest child.

Narita Pilgrimage Record, Volume One

Ukisu Sengen Shrine is located in a place called Sengensaki in Higashi-Komatsukawa Village. The shrine territory is six koku (recorded as being in Musashi Province on October 24th, first year of Keian era). Previously, it was under the authority of the Ina clan. There is a Shinto ritual every year on the last day of the fifth month. Ancient mirrors, two in total, are kept as sacred treasures (mentioned below). The shrine priest is called Sugiyama Shuzen (this family sheltered a retainer of the Satomi clan during the Battle of Konodai and was destroyed by the Hojo clan, but was restored in the second year of Kan'ei).

Someone says that according to the Hyobu-shiki (Military Regulations), Ekinmatsu in Owari Province is now colloquially called Matsukawa, so Komatsukawa would be Komatsu-kawa (There is Haimatsu Village in Soma District, and Haimatsu would be Ekinmatsu. It is a village by the Kokai River. Also, in the Hitachi Fudoki it says "convenience post station at Enoura Port." This is also land along a river).

At Bettoū Zenshoji Temple, there is a shrine called Suzumori Hachiman. This probably relates to the bells of the post road. Also in Minato Village, there is a temple called Zenshoji that keeps an ancient bell. Originally, it was probably a retirement temple of this Zenshoji. Therefore, it appears to have transmitted the ancient bell (The ancient bell of Zenshoji in Minato Village is now at Shinganji Temple in Kitasawa for certain reasons).

Also, in the Engishiki, "Post horses at Ukishima, five horses" and "Ukishima cattle ranch" - could this refer to this area? The fact that the south of Funahori Village is called Ukisu probably means it was originally within this village (Furthermore, regarding the ancient post station geography of the suburbs of Edo, see Volume Four for reference).

Satomi Yoshimichi defeated Takagi Echizen no Kami Tanehiro in the 18th year of Eishō, and Tanehiro and his son, along with their retainers Abiru Hikogoro and Tajima Tosho no Suke, were killed in battle. This is recorded in the Hondo-ji temple death register and Satomi family genealogies. Later, this territory appears to have been taken by the Hōjō clan.

The reference to "Fuchū Rokusho" makes it clear that this area was the provincial capital (kokufu).

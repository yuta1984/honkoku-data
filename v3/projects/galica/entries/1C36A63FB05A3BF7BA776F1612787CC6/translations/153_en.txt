The monk, with his right elbow cut and several arrows lodged in his kusazuri (lower armor plates), came galloping up and said: "That you would all commit suicide here is the true desire of warriors. However, who will hide the young lords left behind at Oyumi? Surely they will be captured alive in such a pathetic manner, and subjecting the legacy of this great general to the shame of commoners would be most regrettable. No amount of lamenting would suffice. If we preserve our lives this time, devise a plan to help the young lords escape, wait for the right moment, and avenge our late lord's grudge in death, our lord would surely be pleased." He spoke with complete reasoning. These men all replied in unison: "What regrettable words you speak! If we flee from here, to whom could we ever show our faces again? We shall simply commit suicide." At this point, Yamashiro spoke again: "This is an error on everyone's part. It is said that determining death as the only path is near and easy, while leaving a legacy for ten thousand generations is distant and difficult. Just hurry, hurry!" Urged on by him, these men accompanied each other back to Oyumi, escorted the young lord, took the precious treasures, set fire to the palace, and fled toward Bōshū. Yamashiro-no-kami, with his lord and retainer making two riders, dismounted near Lord Yoshiaki's corpse, raised his fan, and declared: "This is Echimi Yamashiro-no-kami, a retainer of the inner circle of the one known as the demon-like General Who Pacifies the East, Minamoto no Yoshiaki."

○ Nansembu-shū (Southern Jambu Continent): The "Honyaku Meigi-shū" states that the "Saiiki-ki" says, "Nansembu-shū was formerly called Enbudai-shū," etc. The "Zōshō" states: "Since there is no equivalent for 'sembu' in this land, it is not translated. Only in the 'Saiiki-ki' is it phonetically translated as 'defiled tree.' Nansembu-shū is broad in the north and narrow in the south, with three sides of equal measure, shaped like a cart," etc. Writing "shū" (continent) as "shū" (province) is an abbreviated form. "Fu-sai" (west of the provincial capital) is because this place is located west of the provincial capital. Now it is called Kasai. "Fu-sai" is an unusual way of writing. "Iyaku-san" (etc.) will be explained later. "Chinjū" (guardian deity) appears in the "Hokuzan-shō" as "matters concerning Chinjū Myōjin's court ranks and tax households," and in the Kamo Shrine cherry blossom festival origin records as "Imperial House Guardian Emperor Great Bright Deity," etc. "Hachiman" appears in the "Shoki" as "Tenpyō Shōhō 1, 12th month, hinoto-i day, conferring first rank upon Hachiman Great Deity" (this marks the beginning of conferring court ranks upon deities). The "Kaitō Shokoku-ki" also records: "Emperor Kōken (etc.) Tenpyō Shōhō 8, hinoe-saru year, insects ate the pillars of Hachiman shrine halls, forming the characters for 'tenka taihei' (universal peace)." This shows the reverence for this deity at that time. "Dai-bosatsu" (Great Bodhisattva) appears in the "Engishiki Shinmyō-chō" as "Chikuzen Province, Naka District, Hachiman Dai-bosatsu Hakozaki Shrine (Myōjin Great)." There is also "Hitachi Province, Kashima District, Ōarai Isosaki Yakushi Bosatsu Shrine (Myōjin Great)," showing that the character for bodhisattva was used in divine titles. Tenpyō己卯 corresponds to the 11th year, which is two years before what is recorded in the aforementioned "Shoki." Concerning the donated rice fields...

Writing "Katsumata" simply as "Katsuta" was likely a practice that began after the system was established requiring provincial district and village names to be limited to two characters. Books such as Yakumo Gyoshō, Han Ken-gō, Jōdai-shū, Ruijū Nayose, and Waka-shū identify this as Shimōsa Province. This is probably based on the theory that there was a Katsuta village in Inba District (divided into upper and lower sections). According to Saitō's theory that it refers to a reservoir in Hongō, Katsushika District, this would seem to be based on believing the forced interpretations of local people.

While there may be other places with this name from which poems about a place called Katsumata could be composed, and this would not be problematic, the one in the Man'yōshū must certainly be in Yamato Province.

Regarding Katsumata Pond, although it is considered a waterless pond based on the poem in the Senzai-shū that reads "The pond has aged, the embankment has crumbled, and there is no water - no wonder birds no longer dwell at Katsumata," the left annotation in the Man'yōshū states "the water's reflection was rippling," so it was probably not originally a waterless pond. Inō Eisoku says that Katsumata means "basket field" (katama-da) and refers to what we now call "monkey field" (saru-da). "Ta" and "tsu" are closely interchangeable, and the place name derived from that field, with the pond in that area being called Katsumata Pond. The fact that many poems in collections from the Shin Shūi-shū onward describe it as a waterless pond also reflects this understanding.

○Sacred Biography [Volume 1] Chapter 24: How Toki Jōnin of Shimōsa Province first became a patron of the Saint [Addendum: How Jōnin built a hall and welcomed the Saint, and the matter of One Buddha and Four Bodhisattvas]

Toki Jōnin, a resident of Nakayama in Shimōsa Province, was originally from Toki in Inaba Province, but later resided in Nakayama and was called Lord Toki.

On one occasion, when Jōnin was traveling to Kamakura for his official duties, he had already boarded a ship and was about to set sail when the Saint also needed to cross to Kamakura. The Saint requested passage on Jōnin's vessel. The retainer-servants were not pleased with this, but when this matter was reported to Lord Toki, he granted permission, saying "There should be no problem with a Buddhist monk," and they seated the Saint at the stern of the boat.

Since the Saint, who was dedicated to propagating the Lotus Sutra, was aboard the vessel, perhaps the dragon deities provided protection - the headwinds suddenly changed to favorable winds, and the boat soon arrived at Kamakura. Everyone disembarked from the vessel, and the Saint also came ashore. After expressing mutual gratitude for the consideration shown during the journey, they adjusted their appearances and parted ways.

Later, Jōnin completed his duties in Kamakura, received leave, and returned to his home province of Nakayama.

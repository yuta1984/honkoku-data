Saying it could not be spoken of lightly, they gathered at the Banshindō hall of Hōon-ji temple, a Nichiren temple that was Genroku's family temple. They drank sacred water and solemnly declared that having resolved upon this matter, they would never turn back twice.

Then they sent word of this plan to their kinsman Mino-no-kami-nyūdō Sanrakusai. Sanraku was greatly pleased and immediately dispatched a messenger to Bōshū to invite Lord Satomi. Yoshihiro then mustered the forces of his entire province along with troops from Sōshū and advanced to Kōnodai in Sōshū.

However, at that time, a monk from Hōon-ji temple overheard the secret discussions of the Ōta brothers and, forgetting his loyalty to his temple patrons, reported this matter to Odawara. As a result, Tōyama Tanshū, lord of Edo Castle, was granted permission to launch a punitive expedition against the Ōta, and when he was already advancing, the Genroku brothers found their signals had gone awry and fled under cover of night to Iwatsuki.

Lord Ujiyasu and his son promptly set out and advanced toward Kōnodai. Tōyama Tamba-no-kami of Edo, Tominaga Saburō Zaemon, and Takaki Tanetoki of Koganei, before the Odawara forces could be seen, had already advanced to the banks of the Kōnodai River and taken up positions.

On the early morning of the 7th day of the 5th month of Eiroku 7, when Ujiyasu and his son led the military forces of Izu, Sagami, and Musashi in their advance, by dawn the Bōshū vanguard had moved up from the foothills and taken position on the middle slope. Perhaps Tominaga, Tōyama, Takaki and others thought the enemy was retreating - they charged straight up the steep Kōnodai plateau in a single line and appeared to pause for breath.

Preface

1. This compilation is an expanded version of the posthumous manuscript by our predecessor Satatoshi, beginning with a complete record of matters concerning Narita. Along the pilgrimage route from Edo, I have recorded the historic sites and the origins of shrines and temples in order of the route, without distinguishing between refined and popular accounts. The selection and interpretation are left to the reader's discretion.

1. The main text follows what is transmitted by the temples and shrines. Citations are written with single-character indentation. The unavoidable explanations in between are not meant to distinguish between gems and stones, but merely to correct factual inversions.

1. For ancient vessels and metal-stone artifacts, I have made reduced copies of authentic illustrations. For old castles and remaining earthworks, I have recorded the general outline of their topographical features to glimpse one aspect of the social conditions of that time and to serve as a guide for tracing the past deeds of historical figures.

1. Regarding the places such as Mama, Kōnodai, and Funabashi recorded in the "Edo Meisho Zue" (Illustrated Guide to Famous Places in Edo), where that work includes current authentic illustrations, this compilation records ancient historical events and battles. Where that work includes classical poetry and compositions, this compilation takes modern poetry and songs. This is merely to avoid the fault of following others blindly. Readers should not find this strange.

Sometimes scattered, suddenly far and suddenly near, this too is a remarkable sight.

○According to the Sakura Fudoki (Sakura Topographical Record), viewing this marsh from flat ground does not provide good scenery because reeds and miscanthus obstruct the view. However, it is suitable for viewing from elevated locations. Among such vantage points, Hiraga is the best, with Iino coming second. From Hiraga, one can see smoke rising and water clear as a mirror stretching for thousands of acres, with mountains around the bay appearing as if bowing, sitting, running, or standing still, and green screens opening like paintings. From Iino, one sees a vast bay stretching like a long belt of molten silver, water like white silk, waterfowl flying and crying, gentle winds and slanting sun, with Mount Fuji visible a thousand ri away.

In total, there are thirty villages surrounding this marsh. Jinbo, Shina, Aosuge, Sakizaki, Usui, Dobu, Hagiyama, Iida, Ōsakura, Kashiwagi, Shimokata, Kitasuga, Yashiro, Ōtake, Sakanao, and Ajiki all belong to Intō District, beginning from the northwest and circling through west, south, and east to end in the north. Funao, Matsuzaki, Yoshida, Iwato, Shito, Kamakari, Seto, Matsumushi, Hagiwara, Nakane, and Kasagami all belong to Inzai District, beginning from the north and circling around Intō District.

The Daihannnya-kyō sutra boxes at Shingūji Temple in Namiki Village, Katori District《The characters are carved. All three boxes are the same, with two of them marked "within 300" and "within 600." ○Upon examination, the vermillion seal for the shrine domain of Rokusho Shrine in Fuchū recorded it as Inba District up until Yūtoku-kō's time. This likely has some connection with Shioko. Shioko referred to the land of four villages in Inba District: Nekoya, Mikado, Mochikusa, and Okada》

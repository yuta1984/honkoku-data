Part One

Illustration of the battle between Hōjō Ujiyasu and Satomi Yoshihiro at Kōnodai

At the ferry crossing, clouds arise like gentle thunder,
Muddy waves with northern momentum
About to collapse, drumming poles in midstream,
Thinking of past events, wind and rain filling the sky
Darken Kō-dai

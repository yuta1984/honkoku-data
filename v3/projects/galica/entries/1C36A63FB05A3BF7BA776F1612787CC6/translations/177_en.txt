Same collection, Autumn section: "Gathering the newly pressed sake from Katsushika's early rice while the grebes call, the moon has tilted in the sky" - Mabuchi

Mama Tsukihashi (Mama Continuance Bridge): This is the small bridge on the Mama side among the two bridges spanning the narrow stream below Kōbōji Temple. (Note: In "Narubeshi," it states that the reason "tsukihashi" is called "tsukihashi" is probably because "tsuki" (continuance) is read as "mama," but since there are also similar bridges like Yodo no Tsukihashi and Mano no Tsukihashi in Settsu, and Nago no Tsukihashi in Echigo, this is probably indeed Mama no Tsukihashi)

From the meaning of the Man'yōshū poem "ano oto sezu" (making no sound), it appears that even horses crossed back and forth, so in ancient times it must have been quite a large bridge.

(Note: From Man'yōshū 14, mutual love songs. According to Ryakukai, it means "making no footsteps." For narrow rivers, a single board is laid across, but for slightly wider ones, posts are erected facing each other in the middle of the river, horizontal beams are tied to them, and long boards are connected - this is called a tsukihashi (continuance bridge). The poem expresses the wish for a horse that would cross this bridge silently when secretly visiting one's beloved)

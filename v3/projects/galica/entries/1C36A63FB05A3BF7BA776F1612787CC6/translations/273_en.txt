Field excursion　　　　Come now, let us dance as eastern maidens today and pick young herbs in the fields of Katsushika　　Kodō
Song of early autumn　Dew scatters on the early rice fields of Katsushika where grebes dwell, and the first autumn wind blows over the ears of grain　　Shungō
Wild geese　　　　　　Crossing seas and mountains in the autumn wind, wild geese cry as they pass over the swift currents of Katsushika where grebes dwell　　Edanao
As a song of early winter　Drizzling rain colors the sparse grass, winter has come to the fields of Katsushika where grebes dwell　　Shigeko

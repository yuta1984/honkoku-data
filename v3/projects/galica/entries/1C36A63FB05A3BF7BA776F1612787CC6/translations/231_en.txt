Later, Tanesada went up to the capital and visited Yoshino, and when the Prince of the Western Expedition descended, he accompanied him down to Kyushu, was appointed Ōsumi-no-kami, and also governed Hizen Province. Nichiyū Shōnin also went down to Kyushu and established Matsuo-yama in Hizen Province, taking the lineage of Nakayama in Sōshū, and this place is called Nakayama as "two mountains, one temple" until future generations.

"Hachisu nashi / shika iu kimi no / hige naki ga goto" (Without lotus / like you who speak thus / without a beard) [Note] The left annotation states: "It is said that someone heard this and said: 'Prince Niitabe went on an excursion to the capital area and viewed Katsumata Pond. Moved in his heart, upon returning from that pond, unable to contain his affection, he spoke to a court lady saying: Today I went on an excursion and saw Katsumata Pond. The water's reflection was rippling, the lotus flowers brilliant and pitiable. My heart breaks and I cannot express it in words.' Thereupon the court lady composed this playful poem and frequently recited it."

The Katchi Tokai-hen also states {{marginal note: The Katchi Tokai-hen annotation says {{marginal note: Kōkei}} This summarizes the intent of Keichū's theory in Zentai Sōchū-shō. The theories claiming it to be in Mimasaka or Shimōsa provinces are stated to be incorrect in that commentary}} "Today [he] went on an excursion and saw Katsumata Pond" and also "went on an excursion to the capital area and viewed Katsumata Pond."

Upon examination, the character "to" (堵) appears in several places in the Man'yōshū and is consistently read as "tsu" (都) {{marginal note: Suzuya says "The phonetic correspondence between 'to' and 'tsu' appears frequently in the Man'yōshū. There are examples like writing 'fukusō' as 'fukusō' in the Kojiki and 'fukumei' as 'fukumei' in the Nihon Shoki, etc."}}. Therefore, "tori" (堵裏) refers to "tsuri" (都裏), meaning a place near Nara. From the phrase "today's excursion," we can understand that he did not travel to another province.

The fact that books such as Okugi-shō and Utamakura Nayose identify this as Mimasaka Province is probably based on the fact that the Wamyō Ruijū-shō lists Katsuta District and Katsuta Village in Mimasaka Province. Although that same work reads it as "Katsuta," the Sandai Jitsuroku for the eighth month of the second year of Jōgan refers to "Katsumatada District of Mimasaka Province." There is also a Katsuta Village in Haraihara District of Tōtōmi Province, which the Wamyō-shō reads as "Katsumata" in this section. It appears that writing "Katsuta" and reading it as "Katsumata" was the practice.

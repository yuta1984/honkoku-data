So they deliberately took position on the middle slope to engage the enemy at this difficult terrain. Meanwhile, Tōyama Tamba-no-kami and his son from Edo, along with Tominaga Shirō and others, charged in and attacked upward while raising battle cries. On the Bōshū side, Masaki Daizen led the vanguard, along with powerful warriors like Kurokawa Gon'emon and Kawasaki, as well as hot-blooded young men who had now become enemies: Ōta Genroku, Gengorō, Genshirō, and Chōnan Shichirō, all attacking in a frontal assault. The Odawara forces underestimated the enemy and tried to pursue them up the slope step by step. The Bōshū forces looked down on the enemy and, like dropping large stones, shouted all at once and cut them down.

Ōta Genrokurō, well knowing the forces of Tōyama Tamba-no-kami and his son, attacked them and cut down six mounted warriors including Tōyama who were advancing. At that time, he engaged with Shimizu, who was renowned as Sagami Province's peerless strong warrior. When his sword was broken by Shimizu's iron staff, he crouched low and managed to escape. Being extremely frustrated, thinking that if he struck again with a sword it would break, he had prepared an eight-shaku iron staff that he always treasured. For this later battle, he brought out this great staff seven sun in circumference, swinging it around and around, riding about trying to strike down Shimizu somehow. However, Shimizu finally disappeared from sight, so crying "How vexing!" he struck around at whatever he could hit, regardless of helmet bowls or body armor.

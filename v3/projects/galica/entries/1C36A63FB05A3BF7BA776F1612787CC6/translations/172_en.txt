...the Buddha statue is being created and manifested. I humbly rush to worship and pay reverence to it. [The Buddha] wishes to cause all sentient beings to open the Buddha's knowledge and insight 《Side note: and so forth》
However, I have truly been enlightened since time immemorial—this is the truth. But regarding the matter of the Buddha's eye-opening ceremony, please quickly send Iyobō and have it performed promptly. Please have the entire Lotus Sutra read into the six sense organs of the Buddha statue, making it into the living Teaching Master Shakyamuni, and then reverently welcome it in. Since this concerns neither myself nor my child, I wonder what this means. Regarding matters of the halls on your estate, the Ācārya Daishin has heard about it. Again and again, please worship and form karmic connections with it. However, since you performed offerings to Daikoku some time ago, have you not been lamenting worldly affairs since then? This time, fortune will come like the ocean tide at full flood, like the full moon; your life will be long, and your afterlife will be at Vulture Peak, so please think thus. September 26th, Nichiren, respectfully submitted

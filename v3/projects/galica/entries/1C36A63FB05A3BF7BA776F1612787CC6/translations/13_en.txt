It is called an "in" (temple). The founding is not well known in detail, but the restoration occurred in the third year of Eitoku. 《Temple treasures bore inscriptions with that era name according to the Sakura Fudoki, but they are now lost》

Chibasan Kairiniji Temple - Located in Kaburaki Village. Temple domain of 30 koku 《Keian 1st year, 8th month》. It belongs to the Ji sect and is a branch temple of Taemazan Muryōkōji in Sagami Province. The principal image is Amida Nyorai. According to temple tradition, Chiba-no-suke Tsunetane was viewing the moon at the seashore with his descendants on the 26th day of the 7th month of Jishō 3 《the temple is still opened on this day》 when there was a strange light on the sea, so he ordered nets to be cast and obtained a golden Amida statue. In Bunji 3, he built a temple at Makuwari and enshrined that statue there. This is that very temple.

Originally it was a Shingon temple hall, but after Sadatane became a devotee of the monk Ippen, it became Ji sect, with the monk Taa Shinkyō Daiwashō as its restorer 《Ippen, Shōjumaru, and Chishin are said to be the second sons of Kōno Michihiro of Iyo. He passed away on the 20th day of the 8th month of Shōō 2》

Makuwari Yasutane succeeded Chiba-no-suke Tanenao, and when he moved from Chiba to Moto-Sakura, the temple was relocated to this place 《There are portrait statues of Tsunetane and Sadatane, about five to six sun in height. Sadatane's portrait hall burned down during the Keichō era》

Moto-Sakura Former Castle Site - Located at Moto-Sakura Nekoya 《Nekoya was formerly called Kibe, as seen in the Kōtoku Chronicles: "Built the Nutari stockade and established Kibe households" etc.》

This is the former castle site of Masakadoyama. In the old days, the main entrance of this castle was around what is now Eta-machi

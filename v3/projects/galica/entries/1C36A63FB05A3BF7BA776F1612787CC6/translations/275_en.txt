Moshunzan Hōshōji Temple is located in the same place, with temple land of 30 koku (Keian 1st year, 7th month of the Year of the Earth Rat; the land is in Haraki Village and Innai Village). It belongs to the Zen Sōtō sect under Usui Sōtokuji Temple. The principal image is Shō Kannon. The founder was Naruse Izunokami Yukinari, and the founding priest was Taiyō Oshō (who passed away on the 10th day of the 9th month of Jōō 1st year, Year of the Water Dragon. This temple was originally in Kitonai, Innai Village, but later moved to its current location). Within the temple grounds stands a monument to the Naruse family, inscribed with the names of three who died in loyal service.

○Kurihara Hongō is likely the Kurihara Village listed in the Wamyō Ruijushō. That work lists six village names in Katsushika District. "Tomo" would be read as "Toke," likely referring to present-day Togasaki (now belonging to Katsushika District in Musashi Province. While Ise's Watarae is read as "Watarae," Kawachi Province's Furuichi District's Shakudo Village is read as "Sakato," and Suruga Province's Udo District is read as "Udo," so this would also use the "to" reading. "Ke" should be read as "ke" rather than "mo," similar to Kōzuke and Shimotsuke. According to the "Sōsha Denki Kōshō," the character "ke" was often used as a kana for "mo").

The aforementioned "Original Affairs of Medicine King Bodhisattva" chapter contains passages about women's attainment of Buddhahood, and this chapter was likely taken to form the cloister name. A bettō (temple administrator) is the head of a temple and holds a temple office. The dentō daihōshi (great dharma master of lamp transmission) mentioned below is a Buddhist official rank. These should be distinguished and understood separately. The Kan'i Tsūkō cites the Shoku Nihongi, stating that in the seventh month of Tenpyō-hōji 4, on the day of kōjutsu, at the request of Dainsōzu Rōben and others, a system of four ranks and thirteen grades was established. This was divided into three categories: dentō (lamp transmission), shugyō (practice), and jūji (sutra recitation), each having four grades: hōshi-i (dharma master rank), man-i (full rank), jū-i (resident rank), and nyu-i (entry rank). Additionally, there was a separate daihōshi-i (great dharma master rank), making thirteen grades in total. The daihōshi-i was the highest rank of the fourth grade, and both hōshi-i and daihōshi-i were bestowed by imperial decree, while man-i, jū-i, and nyu-i were bestowed by recommendation, showing how prestigious the daihōshi-i rank was at the time. This nun's rank certificate dates from one month before this system was established. About the nun Zenshō, I cannot determine [her identity] (both the ancient mirror section and this section are excerpted from some record).

Provincial Capital Ruins: Located in Kōnodai Village (the land of 100 koku belonging to Sōneiji Temple is now called Kōnodai Village, but originally it was part of Ichikawa Village. Some ancient books write it as Kofudai, Kōdai, Kōnodai, etc., but all are incorrect). The place now called Kōnodai is this location (the Zusō-ki's description "steep banks rising high with a great river flowing below" perfectly captures the topography of this place).

○The Edo Meisho Zue states that the provincial capital was located in Kasai, and in Sōchō's travel record Azuma Miyage from Eishō 6...

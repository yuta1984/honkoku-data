Drawing closer, he pulled back his tremendously strong bow (requiring three men to string) to its full thirteen-bundle length and said, "I am Yokoi Shinsuke, guardian deputy of Miura. Receive this!" and shot precisely. He aimed at and shot through the chest plate of Yoshiaki's armor, with the arrowhead penetrating more than three inches. Even such a fierce general instantly lost consciousness, stood swaying with his sword as a crutch, and died. Yokoi struck his empty quiver and gave a victory cry, shouting "I have shot down the enemy general!" Just then, three horsemen from the lord's personal guard rushed up to strike down Shinsuke. Shinsuke's retainer, a man named Kobayashi Heizaemon, came galloping up, leaped from his horse, struck down one of the approaching enemies, and scattered the other two. In that interval, Shinsuke mounted his horse and they rode together continuing the battle. During this time, Matsuda Yajiro charged diagonally on horseback, struck a blow that felled Yoshiaki, and took his head. Though he was such a great general, his luck had run out and he was killed in a most anticlimactic way. Sasaki Shiro, Echimi Hachiro, Sano Tozō, Machino and other personal guards had penetrated deep into enemy territory and were fighting, but when they heard of their general's death in battle, thinking "For whom should we now fight?", each abandoned their horses, and thinking there was nothing left but to use their general's corpse as a pillow and commit suicide, they each rode forth when Echimi Yamashiro-nyūdō appeared.

From this we can understand that if one devotes sincere faith to the gods and buddhas, not only will one receive their boundless blessings, but in the next life one will be reborn in a good realm, and in this life one will enjoy glory and prosperity. I say again and again that those who read this tale should revere and honor the gods and buddhas. Through the karmic connection of this merit, may parents, all spirits, all saints and others achieve buddhahood and enlightenment, attain bodhi, and receive the benefits of this dedication of merit.

　Even seeing
　　　　those things of the past that have gone by,
　　how could I ever
　　　　　　forget the divine vow?

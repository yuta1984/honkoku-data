To my hometown　my thoughts travel
but to no avail　covering my fate
In my hometown　the ferns beneath the eaves and
the young pine trees　when will I see
their growing ends?　Just spending days and nights
with longing　overflowing in my sleeves and body
In this uncertain world　it would be better
if there were still some hope to cling to
In the pre-dawn light　unable to sleep at all
night after night　my life continues
coldly on　might there still be
a chance to meet again?　If these thoughts fade away
after my death　should anyone
come seeking me　let this remain
as a keepsake　of my time after death

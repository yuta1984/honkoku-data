Facing the enemy and encouraging all the troops, what made the martial prowess of the Netherlands shine as it had been transmitted from ancient times was that the prince himself first advanced and strongly repelled the enemy. However, he was suddenly surrounded by enemy soldiers and was in almost grave danger, when his retainer cavalry charged in and rescued him through fierce fighting. During that bitter battle, a stray bullet struck the prince's left shoulder and his allies turned pale, but the prince did not flinch at this. Instead, he inspired his allies' courage, and they finally repelled the enemy.

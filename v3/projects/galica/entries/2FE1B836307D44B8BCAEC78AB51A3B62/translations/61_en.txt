Advancing with fierce determination to pursue them, Bonaparte's soldiers finally broke ranks and fled in disorder. Along the way, they abandoned cannons, ammunition wagons, supply wagons, and various military equipment so extensively that the ground could not be seen, scattering in all directions. Blücher, taking advantage of the bright moonlight that night, ordered his troops to drive the enemy from the villages. When his forces advanced and entered Genappe, they captured Bonaparte's carriage. At this time, Bonaparte lost his hat and sword, and fled in panic and confusion. Bertrand (a person's name) barely managed to follow him.

Along the way, crowds gathered from far and near to witness their fate. The monarchs of the allied nations then consulted together and decided that Bonaparte should be exiled to the island of Saint Helena. He was sent there aboard the Northumberland (ship name) under the command of Captain Cockburn. Those who accompanied him to the island were Bertrand, Count Montholon, General Fuscas, Gourgaud and others, along with their wives and children, and three female servants. Alas, Bonaparte, the ringleader who treated countless people with cruelty and earned the anger and curses of multitudes!

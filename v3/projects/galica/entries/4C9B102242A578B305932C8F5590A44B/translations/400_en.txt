After that, it was rebuilt and the temple buildings still stand majestically today. The principal image is a standing statue of Amida Buddha. Originally there were six sub-temples (tatchū), but now four remain: Kōren-ji, Bungyō-ji, Hōtsū-ji, and Tanaka-ji.

Naiku Shrine is located on the seashore of the same village, enshrining the deity Amaterasu Ōmikami. This area is lush with green pines, clear shadows spread over vast expanses, and waves extend for thousands of ri, creating particularly fine scenery. It is also considered an excellent place for cooling off during summer months.

Muyamato Gongen Shrine is located east of Takasuga-chō in the same village. The main shrine enshrines Takamimusubi-no-mikoto and Izanami-no-mikoto; the eastern shrine enshrines Shingū Hayatama-o and Kasuga Daimyōjin; the western shrine enshrines Nachi Kotosaka-o, Inari Ukemochi-kami, and Ōkayamato-omi-no-mikoto. In recent times, it received imperial permission and was granted the divine rank of Senior First Rank. The shrine name "Muyama" comes from the fact that they invited the deity from Aika Muyama Shrine, a subsidiary shrine of Ise. The shrine priest is from the Gotō family.

Oysters are caught in the waters off this village. Compared to other production areas, they are exceptionally delicious in both form and flavor, being the finest local specialty.

Hōmeishu (life-preserving sake) is produced in this village. Its fine taste is not comparable to other so-called famous sakes; truly, one drink can preserve longevity. In general, there are very many sake-brewing houses in this district, shipping to various provinces on par with Ikeda and Itami in Settsu Province. The Engi-shiki records that sacred sake was offered from Owari for the monthly festivals at Ise Grand Shrine, showing that sake production in this province is also ancient.

Ikkōkō (one-bite incense) was first manufactured by the Kameya Kyūbei family in Takasuga-chō of this village. Originally it was called keshi-kō (poppy incense), but when it was once presented to the domain lord, he was particularly pleased and named it ikkōkō. From then on, its reputation spread far and wide, being shipped in great quantities to the three capitals and various provinces, to the point where daily production became insufficient. The shop called Minato-ya also manufactures this equally, and while the quality and flavor are difficult to distinguish, Kameya is considered the original house. Other shops have also learned to manufacture this, but aside from these two houses, their production methods are considerably inferior. This place is the most prosperous in the district, with beautiful streets and magnificent merchant houses, truly the most wealthy area, so its specialties are too numerous to enumerate completely. The fact that there is something called "Ōno stirrups" in the world suggests there may have been master craftsmen here. The term "Ōno-gake" for stirrups probably also derives from this place. I record this here for future reference.

In a report on shrine lands (shinryō chūshin-jō) dated the 23rd day of the 4th month of Bunna 3 (1354), signed by five officials including Acting High Priest (gon-gūji) Owari Nakakats and Sanenaka, it states: "Complete Record of Sacred Lands of Atsuta Grand Shrine, Currently Administered: Aichi County - Minami-Takada Village..., Sakura Village..., Kami-Nakamura Village..., Iwatsuka Village..., Enokitsuka Village..., Ōwaki Village..., Ure-Ishiki..., Issaikyō-den..., Gōdo Village..., Kita-Takada Village..., Komono Village..., Chita County - Onbeta Village..., Ōzato Village..., Otsukawa Imperial Garden..., Agui Village..., Ikuji Village..., Kida Village..., Nakajima County - Suzuki Village..., Tamiya Imperial Garden..., Tomoe Estate..., Haguri County - Hannyano Village..., Niwa County - Kaminuma Imperial Garden..., Yashima Imperial Garden..., Kuga Mitono-tsuka Imperial Garden..., Shibatsuka Village..., Total: 562 chō 8 tan 110 bu of fields and paddies..." This represents the shrine lands from the middle ages, but due to various transfers, it differs greatly from the current shrine lands. The present sacred lands amount to over 4,900 koku, plus 756 koku for building sites, and 580 koku of offering fields in Kozuka, Yaya, and Nanajo villages within Noritake Estate in Aichi County. Including the domains of the High Priest and the lands held by shrine families and monks, the total shrine lands approach 10,000 koku, but for certain reasons this is abbreviated and the exact amount is not recorded here.

High Priest (Dai-gūji), One Position: The Kanpyō Chronicle states that "from the first year of Suchō (686), seven shrine guardians were first established (one as chief, six as attendants), all exempt from corvée labor." This was the beginning of shrine officials and positions. The reference to "one as chief" marks the origin of the High Priest position. Originally from the Owari clan, descendants of Ame-no-hoakari-no-mikoto, they later changed to the Fujiwara surname and adopted Chiaki as their family name. Their genealogy, as recorded in the Kujiki and Owari clan genealogies, shows that Owari-no-sukune Tadanomikoto, son of Takeinatsune-no-mikoto, was appointed as both High Priest and High Negi, and from him the divine lineage has continued unbroken for 119 generations to the present. Tadanomikoto's 22nd generation descendant was High Priest Junior Third Rank Ise-no-kami Owari-no-sukune Kazunobu, and his son High Priest Ise-gon-no-kami Owari-no-sukune Kazanori. During Emperor Toba's reign, due to a divine oracle received in a sacred dream, the High Priest position was transferred to his grandson-in-law Nukada-no-kanja Fujiwara-no-Suenori, as recorded in the official genealogical charts and the Gyokuyōshū. Fujiwara-no-Suekane, a descendant of Minister Muchimaro of the Southern House, served as deputy governor (mokudai) of Owari Province, and during his residence there, married Matsuko, daughter of Kazanori, giving birth to Suenori. Suenori became High Priest, and his daughter married Sama-no-kami Minamoto-no-Yoshitomo and gave birth to Udaishō Yoritomo. The family prospered greatly, and their descendants for generations displayed martial valor, truly fulfilling divine will as Suenori had received divine favor, making the sacred poem about cherry blossoms not in vain. The literary and martial honors of subsequent generations are recorded in works such as the Hōgen Heiji Monogatari, Azuma Kagami, Taiheiki, Zoku Sōan-shū, and Shinchō-ki.

Assistant High Priest (Gon-gūji), One Position: A ritual prayer specialist (norito-shi) from the Owari clan, with the assumed name Tajima. A descendant of Ame-no-hoakari-no-mikoto who continues to bear the title Owari-no-sukune to this day. Regarding the Owari clan, there is an enormous amount of material recorded in ancient texts such as the Shinsen Shōjiroku, Kujiki, Kojiki, and Nihon Shoki—so much that there is no time to record it all and no end to counting it. Only the most distinguished and remarkable figures are recorded here.

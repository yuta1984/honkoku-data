　　Sōboku
《Marginal note: Journey to the Eastern Provinces》
Among the sacred pines
　Between the trees
　Frost falls upon
　　The sacred steps

When there were
reverent imperial words
and we performed
the great kagura music
　　　　　　then
　　　　Toyonaga

The lord is a god, and the gods
　protect
　　　　the lord,
　and today's kagura music
　　must resonate
　　　　throughout the world

　　　Michinao

The eightfold clouds'
　path that began
　　　to branch out
　for thousands
　　　　of generations
　will stand and flourish,
　　going on—
　the god's
　　sacred fence

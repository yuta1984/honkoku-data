Kaitō District
This district is adjacent to the west of Aichi District, borders Nakajima District to the north, connects with Kaisai District to the west, and is entirely coastal to the south. Originally called Ama District, it was divided into two districts from the time when Lord Yoritomo ruled the realm - the eastern part became Kaitō District and the western part became the present Kaisai District. Ancient texts including the Rikkokushi all record it as Ama District.

Hōkaimon Bridge (a long bridge spanning the Gojō River north of Kami-Kayazu Village) - In ancient times when Jimoku-ji was a great monastery complex, the eastern main gate was located here and was called Hōkaimon, but after it fell into ruin, only the name remains with this bridge.

Kayazu Village (now divided into upper, middle, and lower districts, the area is quite extensive) - The Azuma Kagami records: "6th year of Kenkyū, 6th month, 29th day, mizunoe-uma: arrived at Kayazu post station in Owari Province. Narizuna, the provincial governor's deputy, reported various matters. 4th year of Katei, 2nd month, 10th day, hinoe-inu, clear weather: lodged at Kayazu. At the hour of the boar, the Shogun suddenly fell ill, perhaps mental disturbance, all were alarmed and disturbed. The physician Tokinaga administered medical treatment."

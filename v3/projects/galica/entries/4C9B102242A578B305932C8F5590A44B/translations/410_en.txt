Manzai (New Year's Celebratory Performance)

In the imperial court, on the fifth day of the New Year, after the ceremonial first use of the adze, the Senju Manzairaku dance is performed in the south garden of the Seiryōden Palace. Looking at what is depicted in the "Shokunin Zukushi Utaawase" (Poetry Contest of Various Artisans), the performers appear as Buddhist monks wearing素袍 (suhō, plain robes) and eboshi (court caps). Also, during the time of the Muromachi shogunate, in manzai performances, the senior performer (dayū) held a fan while the junior performer (saizō) held a drum, and both wore kake-suhō (draped plain robes) with eboshi caps over head coverings, and wore tsubo-hakama (a type of formal trousers). The manzai of our district depicted here also roughly resembles this style.

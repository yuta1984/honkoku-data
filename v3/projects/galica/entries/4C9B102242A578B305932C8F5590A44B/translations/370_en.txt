Chō Bun'en

Ten thousand peaks are already covered with snow, a thousand groves have early bid farewell to autumn. Enjoying secluded pleasures everywhere, I simply watch the evening sun set.

When the great roc and clouds finish flying, the vast sea opens wide. The tide sends forth a thousand whales, their sound like thunder. Ise and Mikawa lean toward each other, just like a gateway. Silver waves, layer upon layer, come surging straight ahead.

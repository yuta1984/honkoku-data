Okitsu Yoso-no-mikoto: Fourth generation descendant of Ame-no-hoakari-no-mikoto, whose sister Yoso-ashi-hime-no-mikoto became empress consort to Emperor Kōshō, as recorded in the Nihon Shoki and Kujiki.

Takeda-se-no-mikoto: His daughter Ōami-hime became empress consort to Emperor Sujin, as recorded in the same texts.

Oto-yo-no-mikoto: The first provincial governor (kuni-no-miyatsuko) of Owari Province and father of Takeinatsune-no-mikoto and Miyasu-hime-no-mikoto, as recorded in the same texts, Kojiki, and other historical works.

Owari Shiri-tsuki-ne-no-mikoto: Son of Takeinatsune-no-mikoto who became minister during Emperor Ōjin's reign, as recorded in the Kujiki. In published versions, this is written as Shiri-tsuna-ne-no-mikoto, and his sister Shiri-tsuki-mawaka-tobe-no-mikoto is recorded as O-tsuna-mawaka-tobe-no-mikoto, mistakenly changing the character "tsuki" (調) to "tsuna" (綱). This led to him being worshipped as O-tsuna-ne-no-mikoto at Haritsuna Shrine in Inuyama. However, evidence that it should be "shiri-tsuki" rather than "o-tsuna" can be found in the Shinsen Shōjiroku's section on Kawachi divine families, which lists "Shiri-tsuki-ne-no-mikoto, 16th generation descendant of Hoakari-no-mikoto," and in the Kojiki's reference to "Shiritsukitome, daughter of Inada-no-sukune, ancestor of the Owari-no-muraji." (This interpretation comes from my friend Nakao Yoshiine.)

Mako-no-iratsume, daughter of Owari-no-muraji Kusaka: Became empress consort to Emperor Keitai, as recorded in the Nihon Shoki and Kojiki.

Owari-no-muraji Wakakomaro and Ushimaro: The Shoku Nihon-gi records that in Taihō 2, during the retired emperor's visit to Mikawa Province, they were granted the surname Owari-no-sukune.

Owari-no-sukune Ōsumi: The Nihon Shoki records that in the 10th year of Empress Jitō, on the day Kōshin of the 5th month (first month being Mizunoe-tora), he was granted the rank of Jiki-kōshi and awarded 40 chō of rice fields. The Shoku Nihon-gi, in the section on merit fields reported to the Council of State in the 12th month, Mizunoe-ne day of Tenpyō-hōji 1, states: "Junior Fifth Rank Upper Grade Owari-no-sukune Ōsumi, 30 chō of merit fields from the Jinshin year. During the period of mourning for the Ōmi court, he righteously organized imperial escorts, secretly departed for the Kantō region, and at that time Ōsumi came to meet and guide [the prince], cleaned his private residence, established a temporary palace, and provided military supplies. His merit was truly significant..." The same chronicle, under Reiki 2, 4th month, Mizunoto-ushi day, records that fields were granted to Ōsumi's son Inagi and others. Inagi is written as Inagi-mi in the High Priest's genealogy and Owari clan family trees, and is also recorded in ancient texts as Ina-kimi or Ina-kun.

Owari-no-sukune Okoshi: The Shoku Nihon-gi records that in Wadō 2, 5th month, Kanoe-saru day, he was granted the rank of Gege-jū-go-i-ge as provincial administrator (tai-ryō) of Aichi County in Owari Province.

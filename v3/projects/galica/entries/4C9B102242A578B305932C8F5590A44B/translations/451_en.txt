How long will this body that becomes a sea folk of Awade Bay continue loving without reward?    Monk Nichijun

Hangonkō (Soul-Returning Incense) Mound《Located below the embankment east of Awade Forest》In the first year of Ten'ō during Emperor Kōnin's reign, the seven-year-old son of Ki no Korehiro, Governor of Kawachi Province, came to this place while traveling east to search for his father, but fell ill and died. When his father Korehiro was returning from Dewa Province and met him here, upon hearing of his child's death, he asked the priest Chikō to burn soul-returning incense and achieved a brief reunion in the netherworld. The site became a mound and still remains today. Details are recorded in the section on Nagoya's Seven Temples, so I omit them here.

Also recorded in the Shōbōji Temple Chronicles: the temple's founder, Priest Tōgan, had built a grass hermitage at this bay. In the eleventh year of Hōki during Emperor Kōnin's reign, a young couple from Shinobu village in Mutsu Province《the husband called Onyū (Yasutaka) and the wife called Fujihime》came here on their way to the capital, but Fujihime fell ill and eventually died. During her illness, she composed a waka poem and left it for Onyū: "Do not forget—when my body fades away, in the afterlife's darkness, whom shall I rely upon as guide?" Upon seeing this, Onyū was overcome with grief and requested Priest Tōgan to conduct the funeral service.

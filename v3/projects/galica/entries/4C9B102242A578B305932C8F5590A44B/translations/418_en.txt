《Because there are many hanging cliffs, it is named thus. South of the village there is a path; heading east and climbing about thirty or forty fathoms, one reaches the mountain peak. In ancient times, a goddess came to play here, so it was named "Nyorai" (Woman Came). Later it was changed to "Nyorai" (Tathagata)》
《This was likely done by Buddhists. The flat area extends about a hundred paces in all directions, with a mountain god shrine. From in front of the shrine, looking north, one can see the mountains of Shin'etsu, Hida, and Mino provinces, and Mount Hakusan in Kaga is also visible. The distant ones are five or six hundred》
《ri away, the near ones two or three hundred ri, with Shinano and Owari provinces sharing borders. To the west lies Ise territory, and to the northeast the coastline flows south along the sea for nearly two hundred ri, with the mountains of Kaga layered》
《behind it. Mount Ibuki and Mount Tado, with their accumulated verdure dyeing one's vision, are mountains of Ise. Kanmuri Peak resembles a crown, Shakujō Mountain resembles a staff, and Mount Asama stands particularly prominent - these are mountains of Ise. Looking up at all of them, with one glance south, west, and north, multi-storied buildings》
《a hundred shaku high with golden fish adorning the roof ridges. Thirty ri from here, gleaming and striking the eye, lies that Koshayama Castle. With verdant pines thick and luxuriant, white walls reflecting in the waves - this is called Atsuta Detached Palace. To its south, masts like forests, sails》
《like houses - where merchant vessels anchor is called "Bōtai." In the midst of blue waves, white ramparts like a belt, opening in clear weather, closing when overcast - this is Kuwana in Ise. South of the castle, villages and vegetation appear and disappear constantly. All of these too》
《are viewed from above, taking in north, west, and south at a glance, all gazed upon across the separating sea. And six ri from the left foot of the mountain lies "Ōsato." A dike was built in the sea, several hundred paces square, with flourishing pines arranged in forest-like rows. This was the place our former lord and minister》
《built for his retirement. Now it lies in ruins. Next comes "Yokone," then Yabu, then One, then Hirai, then Asakura, then Komi, then Okada, then Mori, then Ōno. From》
《Okada to Ōno, traveling through sand is most tiresome - this is called "Hinaga Bay." Next comes "Nishiguchi," then Taya, then Tokonabe, then Noma, then Utsumi. During the Heiji Rebellion, this was where Nagata Tadamune assassinated Minamoto no》
《Yoshitomo. Next comes "Oura," then Morozaki. Morozaki is the southern extremity of the district, called "Island Point." All the above villages run south along the coast for over sixty ri, taken in at a single glance. Owari's》
《Island Point and Shima's islands, with Haura facing each other north and south, separated by seventeen or eighteen ri, where tides connect to the southern》
《ocean - this forms the "Sea Gate." Inside the gate lies what ancient songs called "the sea of Se, the sea of Hari"》
《- stretching 130-140 ri north-south, 50-60 ri east-west, with a circumference like a great dish. Ships appear like floating debris, sails like birds, sometimes large, sometimes small, coming and going like weaving. In the northeast corner, the mountain ranges of Mikawa and Tōtōmi》
《appear dark blue like eyebrow paint, and sometimes one sees a white point among them - Mount Fuji. Ah! This mountain, though only thirty fathoms high, can survey twelve provinces - this is the wonder of Owari having no mountains》

This house was originally of a samurai from Owari, whose ancestor was named Genzaemon, childhood name Ranmaru (a different person from Mori Ranmaru). He served the late Grand Minister Nobunaga, and after his lord's death in Tenshō 10 (1582), he became a masterless samurai (rōnin) and lived in Kiyosu. With the capital relocation in Keichō 15 (1610), he moved to Nagoya and became a textile merchant from Manji 2 (1659). With branch stores in Edo's Ueno Hirokōji and other provinces, the family prospered for several generations. An old monkey painting on

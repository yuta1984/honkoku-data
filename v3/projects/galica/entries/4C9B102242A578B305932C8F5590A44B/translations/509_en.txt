They agreed to enter the castle. Accordingly, they informed Kuki Uma-no-jō of this plan, and the combined forces of both men, totaling 3,000, boarded large ships and set out. Half of Takigawa's forces successfully entered Kanie Castle without difficulty. Kazumasu immediately entered the castle as well and was about to quickly order the construction of palisades and other fortifications when someone—no one knows who—entered a sake shop and set it on fire, unexpectedly burning down about thirty ken.

At that time, Lord Ieyasu was at Kiyosu Castle, but as soon as he received news of this situation, he mobilized his forces and, whipping his horse urgently, rushed to Kanie Castle. He first secured the sea approach and prevented Takigawa forces from entering the castle, so half of them had to board large ships again for naval gunfire combat. Thus they surrounded the castle in double and triple rings, constructed palisades around it that night, and on the 19th day erected watchtowers to look down into the castle, shooting arrows and firearms to pin down the defenders. When night fell, they shot fire arrows from all directions, raised war cries, and fired guns continuously from the direction of the Rat (north) to the direction of the Boar (northwest), while the castle also responded with return fire throughout the entire terrible night.

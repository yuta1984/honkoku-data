A tomb was designated, but the white bird flew up to heaven again, so there are three tombs. Princess Miyasu-hime no Mikoto, faithful to her promise, guarded the imperial bed alone, and in the following forty-first year, she consulted with Takeina-dane no Mikoto and established the shrine at this location, enshrining the sacred sword. The descendants of Takeina-dane no Mikoto, the people of the Owari clan, served and worshipped there, calling it Atsuta Daijingu (Grand Shrine).

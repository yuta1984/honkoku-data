Chita District

This district extends into the southern sea of our province like a large island. In the "Wamyōshō" and "Engi-shiki" it is written as "Chita" (智多), and in the "Nihon Kōki" we see the entry for the twenty-fourth year of Enryaku, seventh month, hinoe-ne day: "Thirteen chō of land in Chita District, Owari Province, were granted to Middle Counselor Junior Third Rank Fujiwara no Asomi Uchimaro." In the "Man'yōshū" and other ancient books, examples of it being written as "Chita" (知多) are also frequently seen, and even today both "Chita" (智多) and "Chita" (知多) are used interchangeably without consistency. The theory that "Owari" was named because this district extends out like a tail (o) has already been discussed in the first volume under the section "Origins of the Provincial Name." To the southwest it borders the seas of Ise and Shima, and to the east the sea of Mikawa. The district contains approximately 140 villages, with the east called Higashi-ura and the west called Nishi-ura. It is extremely rich in products, and with its beautiful mountains and seas, its scenery surpasses that of other districts. Particularly in the southern area, from Ōi and Morosaki to Ono-ura and Kakinami, precipitous cliffs rise in layers, and raging waves constantly crash white like snow. Also, Shino Island, Himaka Island, and other small islands floating on the vast ocean all appear before one's eyes in an incomparable vista. Literary men and artists who visit this bay continue throughout the four seasons without interruption.

From the "Man'yōshū":
At Ayuchi Bay the tide has ebbed, it seems—even the boats rowing out in morning from Chita Bay are seen drawing toward the offing.

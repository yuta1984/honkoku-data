Part Two

　　　　　Shinkawa

《Annotation: ｜Selection of Japanese Famous Places Poetry》
Coming to visit, I alone recreate ancient times
Looking at the pool of heroic blood, it still
Has not yet dried—how could one foresee that hiding soldiers
Would finally force the bathing? I only hear
Of selling one's master to横求 seek office—at the river gate
The sun sets and tide marks are distant, at the field
Temple autumn deepens and tree leaves are cold
Elders meet and speak of past
Events, causing travelers to feel
Deep sorrow

　　　　　Jōshun

The fierce general's remaining schemes still exist in the east
In those troubled days, what could be done about the hero?
In the time of Hōhei there was no moral
Order—why need we ask about the
　Differences in victory and defeat? The sound of Chōkai's tide
　Comes with furious force, the御
　Hall's autumn trees shake in the sorrowful
Wind. Now the lingering resentment of a thousand
Years has transformed into ugliness, becoming faceless
Ghost-faced insects

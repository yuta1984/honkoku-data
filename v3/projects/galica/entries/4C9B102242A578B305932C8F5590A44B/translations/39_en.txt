Illustration of tribute rice being stored in the government granary at Hiroi

When Taiko Hideyoshi subjugated the Hojo clan of Odawara, Lord Oda Nobukazu of Owari Province provided assistance, but it is said that he lacked sufficient provisions and ran short of supplies. When Fukushima Masanori became the provincial lord, learning from this precedent, he built three large granaries of several hundred ken within Kiyosu Castle and stored abundant provisions there. During the relocation of the government in Keicho 15 (1610), these three granaries of Kiyosu were moved to this Hiroi location, and many additional granaries were built. However, due to the old name, they are still called the "Three Granaries" to this day.

Due to religious connections, Ryūkō recommended and reported to the Shogun's house, obtaining permission for the reconstruction of Jingū-ji temple. The domain lord (Owari daimyo) also granted permission, and in the same 15th year, the temple buildings were repaired. Fudō-in and Aizen-in were moved from outside into the temple grounds, Iō-in was rebuilt, and a head priest was appointed, restoring it to its former state. 《Note: The mountain name was originally Kizu-yama, but in recent years it was changed to the current characters. Kitō and Kizu have the same pronunciation. This is also based on an official document from the 7th day of the 3rd month of Jōwa 14, which states "Appointing a Jingū-ji head priest, Indirect Descendant Junior Eighth Rank Lower Mifune no Sukune Kizu-yama"》

Main Buddha statue 《Note: A seated statue of Yakushi Nyorai (Medicine Buddha), measuring 2 jō 1 shaku 8 sun in height from the pedestal to the halo. It is said to contain a Yakushi Buddha statue truly made by Kōbō Daishi inside its belly. It also enshrines statues of the Twelve Divine Generals and Four Heavenly Kings. The Shaseki-shū records that during the Bun'ei era, a young man of low status living near Atsuta Shrine suddenly lost sight in both eyes on the 15th day of the 11th month. Feeling distressed, he prayed to the Yakushi Buddha of Jingū-ji, and on the night of the 15th day of the 3rd month of the following year, a monk came and told him to "open your eyes." When he opened his eyes, his blindness was instantly cured》

Fudō Hall 《Note: Located beside the main hall. This hall was originally within the precincts of Hachiken Shrine. The statue of Fudō Myō-ō was made by Kōbō Daishi and was called the honji buddha of Hachiken Shrine. During the reconstruction in the Genroku years, it was moved here and is now protected by Fudō-in》

Aizen Hall 《Note: Located north of Fudō-in. The Aizen Myō-ō statue was made by Kōbō Daishi. This hall was also originally within the precincts of the main shrine and was called the inner sanctuary of Daijingū. It was moved at the same time as the Fudō Hall and is now protected by Aizen-in》

Bell Tower 《Note: The old bell cast in Entoku 1 now hangs at Sōken-ji temple in Nagoya. The Kanmei Diary records: "On the 16th day of the 6th month of Shōhō 1, in the mountains of Mutsu Aizu in Hoshina lord's domain, a woodcutter encountered an elderly strange man who appeared to be about seventy or eighty years old in the deep mountains far from human habitation. When this was reported to the domain lord, he sent people to capture the strange man and question him in detail. The man said his name was Fukubutsu-bō, that he was from Iyo Province, had committed evil deeds in that country making it difficult to remain there, and had come down to Kantō at age twenty-five to live in these mountains. When asked since when he had lived here and how old he was now, he replied that though he felt much time had passed, he had forgotten worldly affairs and could not remember the years. He only recalled that when he came down to Kantō, many people had gathered at Atsuta Shrine in Owari, so what was happening..."

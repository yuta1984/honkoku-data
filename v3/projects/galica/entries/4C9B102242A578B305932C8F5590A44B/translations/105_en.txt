The second day of the sixth month of the Year of the Ox in Tenmei 1 (1781) marked the 200th anniversary of the death of Heisōkoku Lord Nobunaga, and at Sōken Zen Temple in Owari Province, a penitential memorial service was conducted with extraordinary grandeur. Listening from afar and paying my respects, I composed this haiku:

Today's memorial service—
Even the thunder
[Falls like] dew on grass

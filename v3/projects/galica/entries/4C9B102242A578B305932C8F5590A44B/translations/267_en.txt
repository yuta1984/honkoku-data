From "Humble Broom Collection"

Shell palaces span the three islands, vermillion towers overlook the ten continents. Having occasion to inquire about divine traces, I briefly imagine again the journey of immortals.

Pointing nearby to Penglai west of Chōkai, jade palaces and shell towers beneath low auspicious mist. Red springs sprinkle beside the Taizhen Temple, green grass grows level before Xu Fu's shrine.

This body strangely lacks immortal bones, yet in five-colored clouds the path is not lost

[The temple] was established in the seventh month of Kanei 20 (1643) for memorial services, with Reverend Ganyo of Honren-sha as the founding priest. ○ The principal image is a wooden statue of Amida Buddha. The inscription on the bell in the bell tower was composed by Master Razan and written by Lord Genkei. The inscription is included in the Razan Literary Collection, so it is omitted here. Among the sacred treasures is a portrait with inscription of Lord Sōō-in, written in Lord Genkei's own hand.

[The inscription reads:] "Descendant of the Suga family lineage, offspring of Hohi's descendants. Having compassion and filial piety, careful in conduct and speech. Chaste, pure, and upright, gentle and mild. Revering the teachings of extinction, returning to the Buddhist gate. With firm faith, understanding the source of life and death. Here we paint this memorial portrait to summon the departed soul. Morning and evening devotions as if [the person] were present, with respect and without negligence. How could we forget such great kindness?"

The plaques reading "Hōkizan" and "Buddhist Hall Sōō-ji" are both in Lord Genkei's own calligraphy, with an inscription on the back reading "Kanei 20, ninth month, sixteenth day, Junior Second Rank Minamoto no Ason Yoshinao." Among other items, there are many donated pieces including folding screens depicting figures and flower viewing painted by Iwasa Matabei (popularly known as Ukiyo Matahei). ○ Sub-temples: Gyokusō-in, Tōgetsu-in.

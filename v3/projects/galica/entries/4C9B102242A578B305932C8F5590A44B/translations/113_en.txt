Part Two

After the horse heads of the 18th day are finished, the following 19th day is called "礼馬" (ceremonial horses). Each town devises various elaborate schemes, competing with one another to present novel and ingenious displays, parading through the towns all day long. There are fifty, one hundred, or two hundred participants, with the numbers varying according to the size of each town. The amusing spectacle resembles a large-scale theatrical farce. Now I shall illustrate one example to show the general idea.

Ten or so families remain. Generally, it appears that the shrine officials of Atsuta have included many long-lived individuals since ancient times.

Owari Narishige: The Taiki records: "On Bunnan 6, 7th month, 23rd day, Owari Narishige was summoned and told: 'You are aged and your household is poor, yet you work diligently without slacking. I deeply pity this and wish to have you conduct an inspection of Hioki Estate in Owari Province. How about it?' He replied: 'I formerly served as head priest of Atsuta, and because of this, those with power in that province showed me the deepest respect. Now that I am poor and lowly, if I were to go to that province, my former followers would surely show contempt. Moreover, on the day I left the head priest position, I swore an oath never to return to fill this position again and never again to go to this province. Why should I covet small profit and change my former oath? I respectfully decline.' I was deeply moved by these words, so I record them." Later, Tarō Dayū Nakahira, Owari Governor Nakaine, and others all adopted Tajima as their family name.

Chief Inspector (Sō-kengyō), one position: This is a deputy head priest of the Owari family who has held the Baba family name for generations. Nobuyori, the second son of Head Priest Kazunobu, was the founder of the Baba family, and his younger brother was Head Priest Kazumoto. Nobuyori's descendant Owari-no-sukune Takatada's son, the Shinji-bō Renchū, received a written order from former Shogun Minamoto no Yoriie in the Shōji 2 year of Emperor Tsuchimikado's reign (kanoto-tori year), and his grandson Takatsugu was appointed to the position of Director of the Imperial University. From this time forward, the position of deputy head priest has been passed down through the generations. When the lineage of Nobuyori came to an end during the reign of Emperor Go-Kashiwabara, Toshichika, the son of Toshinaka (second son of ritual specialist Higo-no-kami Nakayasu), became chief inspector, and his descendants continue unbroken to this day.

Palace Attendant (Ōuchindo), one position: The Moribe-no-sukune shares the same ancestor as the Owari family and now takes the name Daigi. This family is extremely ancient. According to the Atsuta Honki, in Suchō 1, Moribe Hikotani, the administrator of Ama County, was made the head of the twelve shrine guardians and given the position of palace attendant. This book is quite suspicious and difficult to believe, but being originally an ancient forgery, it contains what appear to be genuine ancient traditions, so it cannot be entirely discarded. Moribe is a family name originally from Owari and Mino provinces. The Sandai Jitsuroku and Ruijū Kokushi record the matter of the virtuous woman Moribe Hidetoji of Ikeda County in Mino Province on Jōgan 10, 7th month, 12th day. The Kanpyō 2 Atsuta Engi shows that in the spring of Jōgan 16, the shrine official director Senior Sixth Rank Upper Grade Owari-no-muraji Kiyoine revised the ancient founding record. This is the same person listed as Palace Attendant Moribe-no-sukune Kiyoine in the Atsuta Daijingū Chinza Shidai Honki, and he is the distant ancestor of this family.

Shrine Officials: Their number is extremely large, with over 400 families. Though there are rankings of senior and junior positions for the intermediate officials and kagura performers, all are old families with proper lineages.

Awata Family: The Shinsen Shōjiroku records that they are descendants of Prince Amataruhiko Kunioshihito-no-mikoto, son of Emperor Kōshō.

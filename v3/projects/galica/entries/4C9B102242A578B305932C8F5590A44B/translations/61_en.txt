Watching them being pulled along one after another, beautifully the village
children dress up in procession formation, and those who practice falconry
hold hawks in their hands, hunters take up bows and arrows, holding
spears aloft in practice, shrine priests and Buddhist monks alike
come forth, crossing on horseback one after another to
serve in the divine retinue—how awesome to witness this sight!

Through the streets of soft Nagoya village,
the great avenue stretches far and wide, and reverently
as the divine procession moves
beautifully forward, both local villagers and people
from other villages come from near and far, sleeves joined together,
setting up many temporary
platforms at the crossroads of the jeweled spear road, gathering on both
sides of the great avenue, where at every house
people cluster and sit to watch the spectacle—seeing this scene of a peaceful reign
with no troubles, so abundantly
prosperous, how awesome
that through this great deity's valiant and
mighty divine authority, all the lands under heaven

within the realm are governed
to an unparalleled degree since the age of the gods—
how wonderful it is to witness
　　　　　　　　the prosperity of this reign!

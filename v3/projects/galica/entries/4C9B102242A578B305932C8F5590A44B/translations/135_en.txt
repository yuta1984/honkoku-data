This is indeed a remnant of the old bridge, and the road that goes west from there through Tsuyuhashi village, Kaminaka village and others toward Kayazu is still called the Oguri Highway today. Throughout the provinces, roads called Oguri Highway are invariably old thoroughfares, so it must have been not far from this area that Lord Asukei Masatsune passed through.

Sakaki-no-mori (Sacred Tree Forest) is located on the east side of Furuwatari Shinmachi. The main shrine enshrines Hakusan-hime-no-mikoto, and the two flanking shrines enshrine Izanagi-no-mikoto and Ōnamuchi-no-mikoto, established in Nin'na 3 (887). In ancient times, there was an old custom of offering sakaki branches from this forest for Atsuta shrine festivals, hence the name. Besides this, there were also Uguisu-no-mori (Nightingale Forest), Nusubito-no-mori (Thief's Forest), and Naorai-no-mori (Feast Forest) in Furuwatari, but their locations are now unknown.

Kokuhōzan Gangō-ji is located on the north side of Obito Bridge street. It is a Jōdo sect temple affiliated with Kyoto's Chion-in. Originally founded by the monk Dōjō, it was a branch temple of Nara's Gangō-ji. When it fell into decline during the medieval period, the temple was moved to Ushitate village and called Tōmon-to Obitoyama Gankō-ji, leaving only a Yakushi hall at the original site. It was restored in Kyōhō 3 (1718) and returned to its original name. The principal image, a Yakushi Buddha, has a damaged body with only the head remaining, but it is a very ancient statue. Ancient roof tiles have also been excavated from the grounds, which are remnants of the old Gangō-ji temple.

The monk Dōjō was born in Furuwatari and became a monk at Nara's Gangō-ji temple. His biography is recorded in the Nihon Ryōiki, Honchō Bunzui, and Mizukagami, but all three works have extremely long texts that are tedious to read, and the Ryōiki in particular is written in archaic style that is very difficult to understand. Therefore, I will now summarize the essential points.

During the reign of Emperor Bidatsu, a farmer in Katawa village, Aichi district, Owari province was irrigating his rice field when thunder crashed and fell before him in the form of a small child. When the farmer tried to strike it with his hoe, the thunder spirit pleaded: "Do not kill me. Give me water in a camphor wood boat with bamboo leaves floating on it, and I will give you a fine son in return." The farmer did as requested, and the thunder spirit took the water and ascended to the sky. Later, the farmer's wife conceived and bore a son, but a snake coiled twice around the child's neck with its head and tail hanging behind. This child possessed great strength - at age ten, he could throw an eight-foot square stone, leaving footprints three inches deep in the ground. He came to serve the monks at Nara's Gangō-ji temple, but at that time there was a demon in the temple's bell tower that devoured anyone who rang the bell each night. This boy said he would stop this monster. The monks...

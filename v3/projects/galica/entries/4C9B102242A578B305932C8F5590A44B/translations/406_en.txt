This mountain was reverently
an imperial temple established by Emperor Tenji's decree, and was a great temple complex,
but it suffered from the disasters of medieval warfare and
fell into ruin. In the few remaining temple buildings,
reminiscing about the thousand-year past, the sounds of day and night sutra chanting
linger in the ears, making it all the more tranquil.

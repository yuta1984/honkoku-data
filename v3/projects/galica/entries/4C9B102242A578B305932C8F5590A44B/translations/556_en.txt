On the second day of the second month, he passed away at age seventy-five. During his lifetime, his steadfast self-cultivation and vast compassion for others were such that those who took refuge with the priest and received the practice of daily nembutsu recitation reached one hundred thousand people. He finally founded the Jōdo Orthodox Kantsū sect, providing long-lasting benefit to future generations, and also established numerous temples. His virtuous accomplishments are too numerous to enumerate, so we defer to the priest's biographical record and omit them here.

Ishida Village (A famous place in Owari, but the exact location is unclear. It is said to be in either Aichi or Chita District, but the Ishida village in this district has a very ancient name and is contiguous with Ishida village in Yagami-no-gō, which now belongs to Mino Province. In ancient times, one would cross from Tsushima ferry to Katsuragi and emerge at Sunomata, so being a village near the highway, it was likely composed into poems. Given such connections, we now assign it to this district and include it here.)

From the Fuboku Collection:
"From now on, will the autumn wind of Ishida village, blowing cold at night, make one beat clothes?" - Minister of Popular Affairs Lord Tameie

Komori Tenjin Shrine (Located in Komoi village. In the Honkoku-chō it is listed as Junior Third Rank Komori Tenjin, and in the same collection's commentary it says "Tomiyasu Manor Komoi village is called Tenjin Shrine")

Renri Chrysanthemum (The elderly man of the farming household Iwata family in the same village loved chrysanthemums and had cultivated them for many years. One time, from the same root but different stems, a chrysanthemum and mugwort grew as twins. People found this strange and celebrated it as surely an auspicious sign of the old man's longevity. Some drew its true form and presented it to nobles, and it was also sent to distant places. Among these, when Scholar Hayashi heard about it, he composed and sent a seven-character poem, which the Iwata family still treasures. Therefore, that poem is included in the illustration to make it widely known. This matter is also recorded in Shiojiri, noting that long ago in the first year of Gankyō (877), the second month of the year of hinoto-tori during Emperor Yōzei's reign, a renri grew in Owari Province, and also in the eighth year of Gankyō (884), the fourth month of the year of kinoe-tatsu during Emperor Kōkō's succession, a renri grew in Owari Province - both events appearing in the Sandai Jitsuroku. It is quite remarkable that again this year, being the year of the new emperor's succession, a renri has grown.)

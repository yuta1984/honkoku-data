《Small print: Official cherry blossoms on both banks bend around the river bay, flowers fragrant and beautiful with many comings and goings, spring thoughts remain in people and still in me, meeting without words, walking among flowers》

《Small print: Outside the gate rowing the river, spring not yet ended, bank cherry blossoms in wild profusion reflecting the waves, from the bridge head one view shows flowers over a thousand fields, on a beautiful day all appears as snow when viewed later》

《Small print: West of the Fifth Bridge spring colors deepen, after the Qingming festival visiting cherry blossoms, blue curtains suddenly locked by fragrant clouds, pleasure-seekers cannot reach the wine houses》

《Small print: Moon illuminating the flower grove, snow indistinct, the river soaked with flower shadows, the moon disk solitary, earnestly giving thanks to the Eastern Emperor's hand painting the spring river flower-moon picture》

Passing through Hori River toward the end of the second month:
The crimson peach and cherry blossom snow layering - shall I see it as the adornment of robes　Naruse Masatada

Viewing the flowers of Hori River:
The continuously blooming flowers at the water's edge - how many thousand fathoms of brocade bleached in spring they must be　Fukada Masatsugu

When I lived by Hori River:
Only knowing the pathos of flowers through dewdrops - therein lies the worth of rising at dawn　Kimura Sensai

During cherry blossom time at Hori River:
Today again different people view the flower shadows - am I the only one who has forgotten the way home?　Mashima Masayoshi

The flowing water's dawn is the blessing of flowers　Kaidai

This scene, with thousands of red lights reflected in the brilliant moon, deceives even daylight, and crowds of high and low social ranks surge like a tide. It is truly a magnificent night spectacle.

Bathing in water and holding literary gatherings, containing floating heart-shaped leaves, the fragrant trees throughout the garden form flower garlands. Incense clouds completely cover the samadhi ground, colored stones are embedded in the sky of the nine-grade mountain. Fortunately there is an acharya who cherishes calligraphy, and through refined leisure we together enjoy our free time}}

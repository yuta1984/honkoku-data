Hirokōji - In the past, this was on the outskirts of Nagono town, and since the area to the south was rice fields, the fact that many kanchō-fuda (temple exhibition notices) are still erected here is a remnant of those times. To the east is Kōshin Hall, and to the west is Yanagi Yakushi, where storytellers, mimics, various shows, and sellers of tooth powder who perform sword-drawing demonstrations constantly gather in crowds, stopping passersby. Particularly during the summer months, in the cool evening hours, people of all social classes walk arm in arm in crowds, and the lights of street vendors' night stalls and tea shops shine brilliantly, with people so absorbed in their entertainment that they lose track of the passing night. It is truly a magnificent nighttime spectacle.

Koshōzan Shinpuku-in Temple <<Located west of Hirokōji Honmachi-dōri, of the Rinzai sect, commonly called Yanagi Yakushi. There is a single willow tree within the gate, and the principal image, Yakushi Nyorai, is carved from willow wood. Every year from May to July there are night exhibitions that are truly bustling>>

Asahi Shinmei Shrine <<Located east of the same Shichiken-chō>> The main shrine enshrines Amaterasu Ōmikami and Amenokoyane-no-mikoto in two seats as joint deities. This shrine was originally located in Asahi village in Kasugai District, but after the capital transfer in Keichō 16 (1611), it was moved to this location. ○Annual Festival <<September 15th: Kagura dance; September 16th: Yudate (boiling water ritual). The parishioners' lantern offerings are decorated with woolen cloth and silk fabric mizuhiki cords, and the kasaboko floats outside the gate display extreme magnificence. The crowds of worshippers from far and near are beyond description>>

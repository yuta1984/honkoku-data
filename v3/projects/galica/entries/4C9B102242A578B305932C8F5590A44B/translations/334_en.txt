Tenryūzan Jōrakuji Temple 《Note: Located in Nariwa village. Jōdo sect, branch temple of Heta Yūfukuji》This temple was founded in Bunmei 16 (1484), year of the Wood Dragon, by the priest Kūkan Eikaku and serves as the head temple of the Seizan school in this district. According to temple tradition, in Eiroku 3 (1560), year of the Metal Monkey, during the Battle of Okehazama, when His Divine Lordship (Tokugawa Ieyasu) had deployed to Ōdaka village, Mizuno Shirōzaemon, lord of Ogawa Castle, reported that there would be danger from Oda forces. So [Ieyasu] temporarily retreated to Tokoname, summoned local people there, and commanded them to guide him to Mount Tenryū in Nariwa. Accordingly, he came to this temple by way of mountain crossing. The head priest at that time, Kenshō, appeared before him and said: "Since Your Lordship's return journey involves few troops, among my disciples there is one called Sōhon who is a warrior of great strength. I will have him lead the monks of the entire mountain, mount the unadorned horses of the mountain, and guide you to Mikawa Province." When he made this proposal, His Divine Lordship's joy was extraordinary.

Small shrines and branch temples without legends are not included at all. Furthermore, since there are not few ancient shrines and temples with old traditions that have been omitted, after the completion of the second part, we intend to compile a supplementary volume to remedy these omissions.

○Regarding sacred places and historic sites where various new and old theories are confused and difficult to settle upon, we consult and cross-reference both official records and unofficial histories to aid in our research and verification.

○The sacred treasures of Atsuta Shrine and Masumida Shrine, the ancient books of Osu Shinpuku-ji Temple, the ancient books and paintings of Myōkō-ji Temple, and the ancient documentary evidence, stone inscriptions, bell inscriptions, and all manner of ancient artifacts preserved at other shrines and Buddhist temples are precious treasures of rare excellence. Moreover, this province has produced an extremely large number of outstanding individuals, and their biographies of virtue and fame are so numerous as to fill a library, making it difficult to record them all. Therefore, in the future we plan to compile two works - "Owari Collected Antiquities: An Overview" (with scaled reproductions for each illustration) and similarly "A Survey of Notable Figures" - to bring their buried worth to light and serve as supplements to this compilation, offering them to connoisseurs for consideration.

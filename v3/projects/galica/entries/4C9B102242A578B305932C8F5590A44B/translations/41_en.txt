up to this point, nothing was lacking for the people's use, and its abundance surpassed other provinces, particularly because it was centrally located with access in all eight directions.

Regarding the origin of the provincial name, the surviving fragments of the "Owari Fudoki" state: "Owari Province was the territory governed by Hosozumi-ko in ancient times. When Emperor Kan-Yamato-Iwarehiko (Emperor Jinmu) conducted his eastern expedition and subdued Yuki-no-obito, bringing about his submission, Ama-no-Hagimuro-no-omi shot at the emperor. Ama-no-taneko-no-mikoto used a triangular stone bow and jeweled thick-feathered arrows to shoot and kill Hagimuro-no-omi, thus ending the Ama clan's resistance. Because of this, the province was called 'Ohari-no-kuni,' and 'Owari' is a phonetic corruption of this." This is the origin of the name Owari Province.

Also, in the marginal notes of the "Shokugensho" written by Master Seika, it states: "When Prince Yamato-takeru conquered the eastern barbarians and returned to Owari, the sword he wore is at Atsuta. Atsuta Myojin is this sword, originally a sword that emerged from a great serpent's tail. Because this sword remained in this province, it is called Owari Province."

Moreover, names like Niibari, Imaharu, and Oharu (the character dictionary states that "kon [cultivation] means haru [to clear/cultivate]") originated from the clearing and cultivation of rice fields and farmland. Present-day Ohari Village in Kasugai District is located in the center of the province and is mentioned in the "Engi-shiki" as Yamada

Having clearly descended to a place near the capital, I thought to ascend quickly, but there were some minor hindrances that prevented me from ascending. In a year with two New Years, spring felt very long, and to console myself, I composed poems on the names of the various provinces in this world.

Owari - Kakinomoto no Hitomaro
《From poetry collection》
When spring comes
　　The plum blossom hat
　　　　　　of the warbler—
　What does it stretch and
　　stitch together
　　　　　　I wonder?

They invited Jitsue, the youngest son of the Master, to serve as head priest and named it Ganshō-ji Temple. It served as a regional head temple for the three provinces of Ise, Owari, and Mino, but on the 29th day of the 9th month of Tenshō 2nd year (1574), it was destroyed by an uprising of the temple followers and became a ruined temple. Master Kennyo petitioned Minister Nobuo to restore the ruined Ganshō Temple in Kiyosu in this province. Later, Ganshō-ji Temple was rebuilt in Hongan-ji village in Kuwana District, and the Kiyosu temple became a branch office. After the imperial capital relocation in Keichō, the branch office was moved to the present location and named Ganshō-ji Temple after its former name.

There are several large cherry trees on the grounds, and visitors never cease coming in spring. ○ Principal image: Amida Nyorai

extends into the northwest where Mount Hongu and Mount Komaki, along with all the other mountain ranges, can be seen clearly stretching into the distance. The beautiful spring weather, summer's coolness, autumn moon, and winter snow provide scenic views throughout the four seasons without lacking. Poets and literary figures of all ages have invariably visited this place, making it a matchless scenic spot.

《Annotation: Shinkawa Collection》 Walking by Moonlight at Biwa Bridge　　　Okada Shinkawa
What is the night like at the banks of Biwa Bridge? Removing caps at the shore, opening collars, enjoying the time passing side by side. A light breeze arises at the tips of water plants, and in the winding inlet, at the edge of clouds, the clear moon rises above layers of treetops. The shadows of red railings fall on the long flowing water, while the sound of white lotus drifts with songs across several tatami. Without speaking of the distance between the human world and the immortal path, I wish to ride a raft straight to the Milky Way.

《Annotation: Yuyuen Poetry Collection》 Passing Biwa Bridge　　　　Enju Dōjin
Outside the castle, meeting people with familiar faces is rare. For ten years I have vainly cherished the old court gardens. The shadow of the government bridge moves as it reflects in the blue waves, while the voices of traveling geese fly beyond the azure sky.

The path to Penglai draws near, and five-colored auspicious clouds welcome the returning staff.

Standing on Biwa Bridge facing the setting sun, gazing far and wandering while thinking of the multitude. Snow on the thousand-layered peaks of the Jade Palace, evening clouds over ten li of the golden castle reaching to heaven.

Though new poems are composed about the beautiful scenery, they do not depart, and sparse temple bells ring faintly, heard across the forest.

Resentment upon resentment at the river's head. White chrysanthemums by the biwa - how many autumns? Inner feelings cannot be expressed through the strings. Mountain rain and river wind bring sorrow to the traveler.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Matsuda Jōshun
The slender moon like an eyebrow illuminates the shallow shore. The minister once parted from a beautiful woman here. The pattering sudden rain passes over the bridge head, like listening toward the strings of a biwa.

　　　Evening View from Biwa Bridge　　　　　　　Murai Taiō
Beyond two or three ri of the government road, the vast evening colors are like a painting. Light mist on the eastern and western banks, the setting sun

Shōjō-ji Temple

The Jizō statue of this temple is a miraculous Buddha known to the world as "Yaba no Jizō" (Jizō of the Archery Range). Every year on July 24th, crowds would gather from before dawn in such numbers as to "tip the castle" (overwhelm the castle town), and on this day grape selling was particularly vigorous, which was similar to the selling of ginger at Shiba Shinmei Shrine in Edo.

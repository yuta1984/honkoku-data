(there was a clump of earth, and when broken with a hoe, this sacred statue was indeed found inside. However, since it did not appear to be the work of an ordinary craftsman, they consulted together about what to do, whereupon Genshō, the founding priest of this temple, requested to receive it and enshrined it as the principal image)

Utashi Shrine (located in Utasu Village, now called Shirohige Daimyōjin. Listed in the Engi Jinmyōshiki as Utashi Shrine, in the Honkokuchō as Senior Third Rank Utashi Tenjin, and in a Genki 2 [1571] copy of the Kōfūnomiya record as Senior Fourth Rank Upper Utasu Tenjin. The Minbushō Kokuchō records: "Kunitsu Utashi Myōjin, shrine fields thirty-eight bundles and余. First year of Emperor Tenmu, Jinshin 12th month, first built the shrine hall. From then until Kanji 2 Boshin [1088], reconstruction was added." Festival (August 15th, hot water ritual, horse head offering) Chief priest (Sugihara family)

Ishizuka (in the same village, there are many giant stones in the rice fields and farmland. Upon consideration, these may be remains of cave dwellings from ancient times. Though called Ishizuka [stone mound], there is no appearance of burial mounds or tombs)

Mount Reishō Saion Temple (located in Fujigase Village, a branch temple of the Jōdo sect's Kōmyōji Temple in Aō, Kyoto. Built by Yokoi Tokitomo in Eiroku 4 [1561]. Tokitomo's dharma name was Saionji Gihei Sōchū, hence the temple name) Principal image (Amida Nyorai) Guardian shrine (Fuji Gongen Shrine. The sacred pine as the shrine tree is exceptionally tall and visible from all directions far and near. Long ago, when someone used an axe to trim its branches, blood flowed from the cut, and the woodsman fainted. The name Mount Reishō comes from this pine)

Kyūbu Ferry (located in Kyūbu Village, this is in the lower reaches of the Kiso River with a width of over three chō. To the west is Mino Province's Akie Village, so it is commonly called Akie Ferry)

Stepping on camellias, passing house ends, there's the ferry - Gettei

Lily Bulbs (a famous product from Fujigase Village. All products of this province are said to be of high quality, but this village is considered first-class. Their shape is very large, their color white as snow, and their sweetness like honey. Many are transported to Kyoto where noble families deeply appreciate them. What the world calls "jade food" truly refers to things like these)

Honmachi Sixth District
Komiyama Sōhō's Shop

This house has for generations been granted audience with the domain lord, permitted the use of surname and sword-wearing, and serves as the head of medicine sales in the domain territory. The Usaien (Black Rhinoceros Pills), Shisetsu (Purple Snow), and other medicines sold at this house are all secret medicines of the lord's household. The signboard with the three large characters "Usaien" hanging above the building and standing in front of the shop was written by the Ming person Chen Yuanbin.

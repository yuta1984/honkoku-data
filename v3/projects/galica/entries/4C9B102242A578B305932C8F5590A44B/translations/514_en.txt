devoted his full efforts to studying the classics of his predecessors. Among his distinguished disciples was Master Kantsū, a monk of great virtue who specialized in pure practices, maintained strict precepts, taught others, and saved sentient beings. However, deeply concerned that in this degenerate age of the final dharma, both monks and laypeople were chasing after fame and profit, going against the Buddha's original vow and the ancestors' intentions, he finally reformed the temple system and made it a Vinaya monastery. As a result, the faith of the four assemblies never slackened, and the pure practices of keeping the precepts remain solemn to this day. According to the Record of Master Kantsū's Practices: "One day the master announced to the assembly: 'I wish to reform Saihōji Temple into a proper Vinaya training ground and invite a learned senior monk to serve as abbot. You should each assess your own capacities, and those who think they can endure should serve the precepts with attendance and practice correctly.'" Then one monk asked the master: 'This temple now has strict regulations and through pure practices sufficiently illuminates the ancestral Way, so why do you wish to reform it into a Vinaya monastery?

Because of the weight of these words, I wish to establish the Vinaya at this temple to make the lifespan of the Buddha-dharma endure here for a long time. Moreover, if we invite a bhikṣu monk learned in the precepts to serve as abbot, those who draw near to him and observe his demeanor will naturally learn what monks should and should not do, generate shame and remorse, and find the opportunity to enter the gate of right view and true practice. If this happens, corrupt practices will be transformed here, and the sect's teaching will shine even more brightly. As for the concern that maintaining precepts in an elaborate way would cause attitudes to change and go against sectarian principles, that depends on each individual's mind. Those who engage with the precepts should think like Great Master Shandao, whose precept-keeping was extremely careful and precise, praised by Nanshan as a master of Vinaya

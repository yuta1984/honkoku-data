Sakura Tenmangu Shrine (located on the south side after entering west into Kozakura-cho Honcho)

Oda Bingo-no-kami Nobuhide constantly worshipped Tenmangu shrines. Once, when he made a pilgrimage to Kitano in Kyoto, in a dream one night, the deity Sugawara no Michizane appeared at his pillow and declared: "I have been at this Baishoin Temple for many years. Now welcome me to the country where you dwell, and I will protect the safety of all people." Nobuhide hurried to Baishoin Temple and related this message. The temple had received the same divine revelation in a dream the previous night, so they bestowed upon Nobuhide the sacred treasure of the temple - a divine image carved by Michizane himself. In Tenbun 9 (1540), he moved it here, built a shrine, and enshrined it as the guardian deity of Manshoji Temple. During the great relocation of Keicho era (when Nagoya Castle was built and the town reorganized), Manshoji Temple was moved to its present location, but following the divine will as indicated by sacred lots, this shrine remained here. (There exists a written account by the former Kan Dainagon who had taken Buddhist vows, which is substantially similar to this text.)

Because there was a large sakura (cherry) tree as the sacred tree, it is called Sakura Tenmangu. The temple administrator, Oukasan Reigakuin, belongs to the Soto Zen sect and is a branch temple of Manshoji. The founding priest was Seian Sosen Shuza. (That cherry tree was destroyed in the great fire of Manji 3 (1660), first month, and now only its name remains.)

《Small print: Most fortunate》
《Small print: Presented to Literary Official Nam Chu-wol　　　　　　　　　　　　Kunzan》
The road enters Fusō, east and further east; across the sea and sky ten thousand ri, the envoy star passes through. The painted bear lodges by night beneath the three mountains' moon; the colorful yi-bird flies at dawn with five liang winds. At the rustic pavilion flowers bloom, halting a single horse; boat beams and rising clouds cross the flying rainbow. Walking and chanting, departing from here, one should turn back to look; eight-petaled lotus in accumulated snow.

《Small print: Respectfully replying to Lord Kunzan　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chu-wol》
Seikōin stands deep and profound, east of Inaba; ten thousand pines, village paths stretch far in connection. Mountains and rivers are beautiful, heaven brings new rain; pavilions high and low, night brings wind. Spring comes early, hearing departing hawks in the river castle; the sun warms as we cross bridges and pass the hanging rainbow. The Penglai immortal sage has white bushy eyebrows; three generations discuss friendship within one gathering.

《Small print: When Korean guests were lodged at Seikōin, I joined with various gentlemen at the guest banquet, exchanging written words and poems through the night until dawn. Passing this place again and feeling moved by past events, I composed this to express my feelings　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chison Teishin》
In the neighboring market, south of the castle, stands a Buddhist platform; I know Korean guests once wandered here. Host and guest seated, exchanging calling cards; brushes and inkstones brought forth, each competing in talent. The banquet ended at the fifth watch when all activity ceased; hands parted, thousand-ri separation bringing催ing sorrow. This banquet ground has transformed into a quiet place; where is the prosperity of that day?

《Small print: Presented to Korean Literary Official Nam Chu-wol　　　　　　Keirō》
In the castle, spring's colors are exhausted, only willows remain drooping; across ten thousand ri of cloudy mountains, the Three Han envoy returns. The moon departs following the traveling canopy; clouds fly alongside the raised sails. I ask about the day of returning home—who will again wear brocade robes?

Kyōhōzan Gokurakuji Isshinin Temple 《Small print: Located on the west side of the same town, it is a branch temple of both Zenrinji Temple on Higashiyama in Kyoto and Kōmyōji Temple in Aō, belonging to the Jōdo Seizan sect》
　Originally located in Wakuri village, Haguri district《Small print: Later called Gokurakuji village》, this was the place where Saint Hōnen resided, but it was washed away and abandoned in the floods of the Kiso River during the Tenbun era. In the ninth month of Keichō 9, the monk Kūsaku rebuilt it in Kiyosu and called it Gokurakuji, then in the same [era's] fifteenth [year]

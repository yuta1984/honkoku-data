Omotaru-no-mikoto Shrine (Located in Kōtai-ji Village. Commonly called "Kōtai-ji's Sacred Mask." It is traditionally said that Shingon Buddhist nuns guard this shrine. In the 2nd year of Genki (1571), when Tado Shrine in Ise Province was about to be consumed by the fires of war, shrine official Ogushi Sajinai Nobumitsu took the divine treasures—an ancient mask and one sword—and fled. Suddenly an old man appeared and guided Nobumitsu to this place, teaching him that the treasures should be enshrined here, then disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, a shrine was finally built to enshrine them, and daily miracles have been remarkable, with pilgrims from far and near continuing to visit to this day.)

Yoshitsune's Bow-hanging Pine (Located in Shimoda Village. It is said that Kurō Hōgan [Yoshitsune] shot a powerful arrow from here as a test, and it traveled a hundred chō before falling, so that place was named Hyakuchō Village, and Yaochi Shrine was also built there. This is an ancient site with such traditions, and there is still one old pine tree remaining. The villagers have passed down the story that this is the pine on which he hung his bow at that time.)

Kamori Station (A horse relay station on the Saya Highway. The station building and inns are quite magnificent and very bustling.)

Okan Shrine (Located in the same place. This is the shrine referred to as Okan Shrine in Ama District in the Engi Shimmei-shiki, and as Senior First Rank Okan Myōjin in the Honkoku-chō. The Montoku Jitsuroku records: "3rd year of Ninshū, 6th month, day hinoto-u, the gods Ōkunitama, Ōmirei, and Okan of Owari Province were admitted to the ranks of official shrines." The Sandai Jitsuroku also records: "7th year of Jōgan, 11th month, 17th day, day kinoe-uma, Senior Fifth Rank Lower Okan God of Owari Province was granted Senior Fifth Rank Upper." ○The supervising temple is Okan-san Kisshō-ji.)

Nikkō River (Located between Morokura Village and Uji Village. It is quite a large river, and a great bridge spans it on the Saya Highway. Downstream there are ferry crossings at Hyakuchō, Kabuto, Kannon-ji, Ōmiyo, and other places.)

Morokura Shrine (Located within the precincts of Senju-in in Morokura Village. This is the shrine referred to as Morokura Shrine in Ama District in the Engi Shimmei-shiki, and as Senior Third Rank Morokura Tenjin in the Honkoku-chō. According to the same collection's explanation, it is the same deity as Ame-no-moroha-no-mikoto Shrine in Tsushima Province, and is the leaf-guardian deity sung of in Yamato poetry. The Kōnin-shiki, Kakai-shō, Sochū-shō and others describe it as "the god who protects all trees" and note that "'moro' is a phonetic variant of 'mori' (guard), making this a deity of silkworms and mulberry trees.")

Heki Village (The Wamyō-shō lists Heki in Ama District. The Minbu-shō Koku-chō also states: "Tomioka Myōjin is located in Heki Village, 200 steps from the village. In the 3rd year of Chōhō, a shrine hall was first dedicated. The divine spirit is Toyooka-hime.")

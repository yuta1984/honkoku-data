Myōei-zan Honren-ji (Located in Fuyamachi. Nichiren sect, branch temple of Honjō-ji in Kambara District, Echigo Province. According to temple tradition, Ōhashi Tarō Saemon-no-jō Michisada became a prisoner for Lord Yoritomo in the second year of Bunji and was confined in an earth prison at Matsuba-ga-yatsu, where for twelve years until the eighth year of Kenkyū he never ceased reciting the Lotus Sutra day and night. His wife was the daughter of the manor steward of Nabetani in Higo Province, so when Michisada went to Kamakura, she returned to her homeland and gave birth to a son at the steward's place. This was Sadatsune. At age twelve, he secretly left Higo Province and went to Kamakura, worshipped at Hachiman Shrine, and recited the Lotus Sutra for his father day and night. When this reached Lord Yoritomo's ears, he was so moved that he pardoned Michisada's crimes and granted him his original domains of Nakashima and Ama districts in Owari Province. Later, in the seventh month of the seventh year of Kenpō, when Hyōgo-no-kami Yorimochi committed the crime of defying imperial orders, Sadatsune was related to Yorimochi's clan and was to be executed at Sanjō Kawara in Kyoto due to this connection. However, suddenly a great meteor appeared, thundering loudly, and demons appeared in the clouds—so many mysterious phenomena occurred that he was pardoned and allowed to return to his homeland. Thereupon he built a temple in Nakane Village, Aichi District, and named it Hokke-ji. On the eleventh day of the sixth month of the first year of Shōka, Sadatsune died at age seventy-two, taking the dharma name Honren-ji. Later, in the third year of Meitoku, Sadatsune's descendants moved this temple to the present location and made the current temple name based on his dharma name)

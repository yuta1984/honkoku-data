　Taking lodging　Tentaku-in Temple

　　　　　Mokurangō

Taking lodging at the temple grounds, the incense burns deep
The autumn wind blows rustling, brushing away worldly dust from my robes
From the high place above, gazing far out over the sea
I understand how the resident monk has abandoned his raft-like attachments

Prenatal and Postnatal Jibo-san (Located on the west side of Gofuku-machi 1-chome, this is a miraculous medicine for gynecological conditions handed down by the Nagura family. When they were in Kiyosu, Lord Nobunaga rewarded their excellent medical skills with a sword, on which a deer crest with two horizontal lines was engraved. This became the Nagura family crest. Now in the eleventh generation, the lineage continues unbroken. There are three or four families bearing the Nagura name, but all regard this house as the main family.)

Shippōzan Ogasawara Shōtoku-ji Temple (Located on the west side going down Shichiken-chō Street to Fukuro-machi, it is a direct branch temple of Higashi Hongan-ji) During the Kanki era (1229-1232), Saint Shinran built this temple in Ōura, Haguri District (originally part of Owari domain but belonged to Mino from Tenshō 12). He appointed his direct disciple Kanzen (whose secular name was Ogasawara Saemon Nagaaki, a resident of Koma District, Kai Province, of the Seiwa Genji clan, who shaved his head and became a disciple of the Saint) as head priest and bestowed seven kinds of sacred treasures on this ancient temple. During the Eishō era, it was moved to Tomita in Nakashima District (before this, it was moved to Kariyasu-ga in the same district, then returned to Ōura. In Tenbun 18, Lord Nobunaga's meeting with Saitō Dōsan at Shōtoku-ji in Tomita took place at this temple). In Keichō 8, it was moved to Kiyosu, and in Keichō 15, it was moved again to the current capital.

Main Buddha (wooden statue of Amida Buddha, made by An'ami) Seven Treasures (Unomaru sword, Matsukaze, tea mortar, Dragon Tree Bodhisattva's eye-crystal, Vasubandhu Bodhisattva's relics, Donran Great Master's remains, founder's ten-character sacred name, founder's mirror reflection - these constitute the seven treasures. Besides these, there are many other treasures, ancient documents, and regulations) Sutra Repository (houses the complete Ōbaku edition sutras) Bell Tower (the bell was cast in Kanun 2, with an inscription by the Ming person Chin Genphin carved on it. There is a grave of Lord Shinshō-in within the temple grounds)

Inscription Preface for the Bell of Bishū Shōtoku-ji Temple
Bishū Shōtoku-ji Temple was first established by Master Kanzen, a senior disciple of Saint Shinran, who laid its foundation in Nōshū, then moved it to Bishū, returned to plant his staff in Nōshū, and finally established it in the present Nagoya. It has already been transmitted through seventeen generations in this place. Recently suffering the calamity of fire, relying on the power of the congregation and donors, within days the temple buildings were renewed and the bell tower was restored. It rings clearly throughout the marketplace, especially marking dawn and dusk in all four directions. The seventeenth-generation dharma heir named Ken'ō became my friend outside the mundane world and asked me for a word to inscribe on this, wishing to harmonize the whale-like sound. How can such an ordinary person fulfill this request?

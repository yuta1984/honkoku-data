The festival of this shrine began around the Kanbun and Enpō eras (1661-1681), as recorded in the "Wakamiya Festival Detailed Records." This black ship float originally consisted of just a ship-shaped structure built on top of carts and storage chests, accompanied only by flutes and drums. However, over time the decorations became increasingly elaborate, and now children perform sarugaku (traditional comic theater) dances, and boat songs are sung at various locations. When this float returns, numerous lanterns are lit, and shamisen and gongs are added to the musical accompaniment as it is pulled along, resembling a pleasure boat outing on a cooling evening cruise—truly a magnificent summer spectacle.

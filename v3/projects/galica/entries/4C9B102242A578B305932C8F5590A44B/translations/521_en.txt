People of all ages, both old and young, come to worship in groups, and pilgrims never cease to visit.

○Main Shrine: Susanoo-no-mikoto is enshrined here. However, according to the head priest's family tradition, there are now seventeen deities in the inner sanctuary: Susanoo-no-mikoto and Ōnamuchi-no-mikoto, with eight prince deities on the left and seven named deities on the right. Considering this in light of ancient practices, this is probably the Kunitama Shrine mentioned in the Engishiki Jinmyōchō (Register of Deities). It is said that referring to the enshrined deity as a single seat is not an ancient practice. Therefore, the old divine names may have been lost, and the current appellations may have begun from the medieval period onward. However, the theory that this is Kunitama Shrine is merely conjecture and cannot be considered reliable evidence.

The shrine complex includes: sacred fence, ritual offering hall, worship hall, offering preparation room, tower gate, south gate, divine stable, library, votive tablet hall, divine storehouse, torch stand (bearing the Ninjai era name), torii gate, well pavilion, purification pavilion, and others.

Subsidiary Shrines:
Imori Shrine: Located one chō south of the main shrine. Enshrines three deities: the beneficent spirit of Susanoo-no-mikoto, the deity of measles on the left, and the beneficent spirit of Ōhirume-muchi-no-mikoto on the right. When the Heavenly King first descended, the divine boat was brought to rest at the forest of Umatsu harbor. An elderly woman claiming to be a descendant of Somin, following the oracle of a sacred dove, enshrined the deity in the forest. The local people worshipped there, saying the deity resided in the forest, which is why it became the shrine's name, as recorded in the shrine traditions.

Kashiwa-no-miya: Located south of the main shrine. Enshrines the wondrous spirit of Susanoo-no-mikoto. In the second year of Tenryaku, by divine oracle, it was moved here from the Imori site. Behind the shrine stands an ancient oak tree, which gave the shrine its name.

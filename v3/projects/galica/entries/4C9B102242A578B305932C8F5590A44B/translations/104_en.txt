[They made] the Zen master the founding priest and Chūgaku the second head priest. It was named Keiyōzan Sōkenji after Lord Nobunaga's posthumous Buddhist name, but was moved here during the imperial relocation to Edo in the Keichō era. When Lord Nobunaga resided in his castle on Mount Azuchi in Ōmi Province, he built a hall on the mountaintop and named it Sōkenji with the meaning of "surveying all" the districts and villages throughout the province. After his death, this temple name became his posthumous Buddhist title.

The third head priest, Priest Minzan, was outstanding in virtue, talent, and learning, and received particularly deep favor from Lord Genikei (Tokugawa Yoshinao). One night the abbot's quarters burned down, so he was granted funds, and reconstruction was completed on the 24th day of the 10th month of Shōhō 1 (1644). Lord Genikei came in person, commanded his senior retainers to gather the sect's elders, and had them compose poems in celebration.

Within the temple grounds, there are many ancient cedar trees that cast deep shadows, blocking the sun and soaring toward the sky. The cloud-shaped gongs of the meditation hall and the stone chimes of the monks' quarters naturally create an atmosphere of profound tranquility and silence—a rare ancient pure domain within the city.

Main image (wooden statue of Yakushi Buddha), meditation hall, abbot's quarters, bell tower (It appears that when Lord Nobuo tried to cast a great bell, perhaps due to the turbulent times and lack of funds it could not be completed, so he took and used a bell from Jingūji at Atsuta, and this ancient bell still hangs there today).

Sub-temples: Kōshōin (named after the posthumous Buddhist title of Nobutada, Lord Nobunaga's eldest son, and serves as his memorial temple), Yōganin, Tōrinin.

Cherry blossoms of Hori River: On both banks from Hioki Bridge northward to Nishi-kazunushi-machi, over several chō, there are several hundred cherry trees. In the third month, people of high and low rank walk arm in arm along both banks, and boats float on the water as people enjoy the flowers above and below - a scenic spot not inferior to the spring pleasures of Arashiyama and Sumida River. During the Bunka years, the domain retainer Hori planted several hundred saplings in rows, which have now flourished as they are today.

How divine and ever more majestic are the pines and cedars! How many generations have passed for this mountain that gazes at clouds? (Gyōbu-shōyū Taira no Masatsura)

Site of Yang Guifei's Stone Pagoda (Originally located near Shimizu Shrine, but was abolished during the shrine repairs in Jōkyō 3 [1686], and now only the old site remains. When Emperor Xuanzong of Tang had intentions to invade Japan, the deity of Atsuta was born as Yang Guifei to serve him, making his heart dissolute to prevent this invasion. When the imperial consort was lost at Mawei, she immediately returned to this shrine in her homeland. This is recorded in ancient books from five hundred years ago and is a very old folk tale. In the old edition commentary on "Song of Everlasting Regret," it records that when the Taoist master met with the consort in Penglai, it was actually at this Atsuta. The Tennen-ki of Taiei 3 [1523] states: "When Li Tang's Xuanzong gathered authority and wanted to take Japan, Japan's great and small deities deliberated and requested the Atsuta deity to be born into the Yang family for one generation, becoming Yang Guifei to confuse Xuanzong's heart and dispel his ambition to seize Japan. Truly, when the consort was lost at Mawei Slope, she took a boat and arrived at Utsumi Bay in Chita District of Owari Province, returning to Atsuta Shrine." This is seen in Gyōfū-shū: "The great deity of Atsuta in Owari is Yang Guifei, briefly mentioned in Senden Shūi," and the detailed account in Honchō Jinja-kō all agree with the Tennen-ki explanation. It's also recorded in Kaikoku Zakki and Shinpen Kamakura-shi that Yang Guifei's jeweled curtain was at this location and was moved to Shōmyō-ji in Kamakura by imperial decree of Emperor Kameyama.)

On the Ninth Day, Paying Respects to the Shrine of Yang Guifei at Atsuta - Zen Master Banri
From Hanrin Gohō-shū

I respectfully address the true consort: If there is a spirit, open the doors of this remaining shrine. I venture to ask: Should lives be eternally entrusted to mandarin ducks? Why do the chrysanthemums of Tianbao and crabapples fall?

The title of this poem in Baika Mujinzō records: "On the Double Ninth Festival, paying respects to Yang Guifei's shrine at Atsuta. Behind the shrine is a stone pagoda called Yang Guifei's Shrine."

Atsuta Regular Festivals (The shrine festivals of this shrine formerly reached over seventy times per year, though some were abolished in medieval times, there are still particularly many large and small ritual ceremonies throughout the year. Now I present the general outline below and record the ceremonies of subsidiary and separate shrines here for the convenience of all people)

New Year's Day
○ Ōmiya Hakkenmiya Inner and Outer Court Ceremonial Offerings (At the hour of the ox on New Year's Eve, ceremonial rice cakes and tooth-hardening foods are prepared; this morning at the hour of the tiger, the head priest makes offerings; at the hour of the dragon, meals are presented and music is performed)

Same Day
There is also a ceremony where the head priest's attendants walk around the corridors of the main shrine

○ The Five Shrines Ceremony (Today begins at Gendayū Shrine, on the 2nd at Hakkenmiya, 3rd at Matsugō Shrine, 4th at Hiwari Shrine, 5th at Minami-Shingū. In each case, the shrine attendants affiliated with that shrine perform the duties. They make male and female dolls, hold farming tools like hoes and sickles, prepare sake and rice, and recite liturgical prayers. When this ceremony ends, the offerings are thrown into the courtyard and given to children. This is called the purification of a thousand sins and six transgressions)

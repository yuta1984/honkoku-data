Seisaisan Jihōin Temple (Located in Baba Village, Shingon sect, branch temple of Mantokuji in Nagano Village)

This temple originally had a full temple complex and was called Kanfukuji. During the medieval period it fell into decline, and only the Kannon Hall remained, but in the first year of Kanshō (1460), a monk named Zenson rebuilt it and gave it the current temple name. However, even now the Kannon Hall is still called by its old name, Kanfukuji. Long ago, through the blessing of Kōbō Daishi (Kūkai), the Todoroki Well sprang forth, and it still exists at the foot of the mountain today. After climbing several hundred stone steps, one reaches the Kannon Hall. From here, looking south, one can see Asama Mountain beyond the blue sea, and the scenery is indescribably beautiful. Moreover, there are several thousand cherry and maple trees in the temple grounds and nearby mountains, and the spring blossoms and autumn leaves blend with the clouds and deceive the mist, creating a landscape that resembles a dynamic, ever-changing painting—truly an incomparable and unrivaled scenic spot. Among these, the places called Kannon-daira and Inari-yama are particularly outstanding.

6th year of Bunji, 10th month, 25th day, hinoe-uma (from the Azuma Kagami)
Using Susai Jibu-no-Taifu Tamemoto, a retainer from Owari Province, as a guide, [Yoritomo] arrived at Noma-no-sho in this province and paid respects at the shrine hall of the late Satyakura (Minamoto no Yoshitomo). (Marginal note: It is said he was buried in this place during the Heiji Disturbance) This tomb had been covered with thorns and brambles, and the creeping vines had not been cleared away. For this reason, he had long sent offerings from afar in the Kanto region. Now the Buddhist hall opened its doors, and the magnificent decorations dazzled the eyes, while monks arranged themselves in seats and the sound of sutra chanting filled the ears. The Second Rank (Yoritomo) found this strange, and when he inquired into the origins to resolve his puzzlement, he learned that since the time when the former Prison Governor Yasuyori Nyudo governed the province, thirty cho of rice fields had been donated, and thereafter a temple complex had been built to pray for [Yoshitomo's] enlightenment. (Marginal note: and so forth)

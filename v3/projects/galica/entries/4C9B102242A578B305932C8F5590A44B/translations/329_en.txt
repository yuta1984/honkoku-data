He was exiled to Chita Bay [sen is a vulgar character for the proper character], but after Lord Kan was enshrined as Tenmangu, his sons were also summoned back to the capital. However, Akehimaru petitioned that he still wished to live in this province, whereupon imperial permission was immediately granted, he was made lord of Chita District, and he opened the five villages of Akehi. At that time, this shrine was also founded. The "white hakama" of the five Akehi villages today refers to the custom from that time when the local people wore white hakama and worshipped the Kan family in the New Year.

After Lord Akehi passed away, the local people, in their excess of reverence, made a statue of him, and to this day the village households take turns keeping the statue for one day each, placing it on a standing mortar with fresh straw mats spread beneath it, and worship it. This is called "rotating lord" (mawari jito). 《Small text: However, because the statue is in monk's form, it is now mistakenly also called "rotating Jizo"》

The statue is most antique and elegant, worthy of belief. That Lord Kan's sons were each exiled is detailed in the Kanke Koshu and other works, but there is no mention of one called Akehimaru. The place name "aguhi" appears in ancient books from the Engi-shiki onward and is very old, so the claim that he was called Akehimaru before his exile is an error - he was called Lord Akehi afterward because he lived here. 《Small text: In the Zatsudan-shu by National Master Muju...》

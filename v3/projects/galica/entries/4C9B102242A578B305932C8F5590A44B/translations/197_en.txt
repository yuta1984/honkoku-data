Yamabuki Valley

The area around Toriya-suji at the foot of the eastern slope of Katahashi was once a valley of the old Nagono Mountain. During late spring, pleasure-seekers would come carrying sake and delicacies to admire the yamabuki (Japanese kerria) flowers while singing and dancing. However, it eventually became residential land for samurai families, and the yamabuki flowers that still remain here and there are vestiges of the old days.

Poem by Seishō:
The yamabuki
　that bloomed
　　in mute colors
　　　has left its name
　　　　flowing through
　　　　　later generations—
　　this valley of yamabuki

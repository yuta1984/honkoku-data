Ascending to Mount Kaishō on a spring day

Occasional Verses in Leisure from Zen Practice
The Dragon Palace and Eagle Peak meet in spring smoke and clouds
In the vista of heaven and earth, the flowers of the Jetavana grove stretch deep
Embracing the sea sun, the Zhejiang tide rises and cools the mountain peak
Climbing the tower is worthy of emulating the spirit of Binwang
Setting down the staff, one should know the wisdom of Baozhi
Sitting and viewing the southern sea for thousands of miles
Without laboring the beating of duck wings in the blue sky

《Small text: A hundred-foot ancient pine, three or four trees; dragon scales hold rain and reach the heavenly path. Even in the cold of the year, they still evoke the pleasure of chanting poetry. Why mix with worldly dust and accompany common folk?》
《Small text: Hōkyū Smoke Trees　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Senzon Teishin　Five-colored clouds arise in the cave, the sky is luxuriant; smoke trees shelter immortals. I think of how Penglai Island neighbors Nanpu Bay; Xu Fu came in those days and moored his ship》

《Small text: Ryūkō-ji Temple Bell　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zengan　Clouds embrace the upper regions, one path leads to splendor; whale roars break through the wild village, making people reflect deeply many times. This must be the divine dragon protecting the Buddhist temple》

《Small text: Neighboring House Pounding Song　　　　　　　　　Hansōan　Rain pavilion knows only neighbors to the north; sparse walls bound with bamboo share poverty together. Dreams at the pillow broken by nearby pounding songs; still recognizing those who have not yet slept in the deep night》

《Small text: Seiōn-rō Poetry Collection　Remembering the past, spring wind and twelve towers; garden groves today, the grass hut is secluded. Who knows that the moon before the white jade screen still illuminates the autumn outside the ivy curtains》

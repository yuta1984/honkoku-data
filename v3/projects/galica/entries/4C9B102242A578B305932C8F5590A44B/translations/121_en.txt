shrine. Also, from the first month of Angen 1 (1175) to the eighth month of Jishō 2 (1178), Yasunaga copied the complete Buddhist scriptures and built a revolving sutra repository to store them. However, more than half of the temple buildings were destroyed by fires of war during the Kenmu period (1334-1338). Kitō Magozaemon Yoshihisa (dharma name Shūkei), a resident of Kiyosu, moved the temple to Kiyosu by order of the Toyotomi house in Tenshō 19 (1591) and made Ryōen, a monk from Shōkai-ji temple in Ōtsuka village, the reviving founder. In Keichō 16 (1611), it was moved to its present location.

Kannon Hall (built in Shōhō 2 [1645], enshrines the Sacred Kannon and Niō statues)
Shōten Hall (because of its remarkable spiritual efficacy, many people have the resident monks perform the oil bathing ritual)
Jūō Hall (built in Enpō 1 [1673], the Jizō and Ten Kings statues are works by Ono no Takamura)
Portrait Hall (built during the Keichō period, enshrines a statue of Kitō Shūkei)
Revolving Sutra Repository (the old repository was abandoned and the current one was rebuilt in Jōkyō 2 [1685]. Although the complete Buddhist scriptures donated by Ōnakatomi Yasunaga are not entirely preserved, the remaining fragmentary volumes are all ancient copies from that time and are extremely rare items. Among them, one sutra chest that still exists today has paintings of the Sixteen Good Deities on its lid, which is most elegant and antique. Also, a five-article pledge regarding the donation of these scriptures was written on the lid as follows. There are many errors in characters and inversions in the text making it very difficult to read, but fearing to damage the ancient meaning, I reproduce it exactly as it is)

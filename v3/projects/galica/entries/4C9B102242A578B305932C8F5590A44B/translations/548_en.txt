Akada Shop
(This is a local specialty. Rice dumplings are made to the size of soapnuts and fried in oil to make confections. Because their color is red, they are called red dumplings, but now abbreviated to "akada." There is a theory that "akada" comes from the Sanskrit word for pills, and that because they resembled the pills sold by medicine dealers here, the name was later transferred to confections, but this is likely a completely contrived explanation.)

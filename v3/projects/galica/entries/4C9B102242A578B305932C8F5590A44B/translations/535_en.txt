The process of commencing repairs to the sacred hall at Monzen: the work of polishing is already complete, white elephants line the eaves creating a magnificent appearance, and emerald curtains frame mirrors that shine brilliantly. As evening comes, lanterns illuminate the area beside the jeweled fence, and as dawn approaches, dragons breathe in the sound of well water. Purifying the heart with cleanliness, bowing in worship before the shrine, praying for the world's peace and offering sincere devotion. The Way flourishes and inspires awe. The poetry of Yakumo, transmitted through flute music and widely known, the fame of this single melody seen from afar. Pilgrims coming from distant places do not lose their way to the soaring forest trees within the sacred precincts}}

《Side note: Western Journey Record Supplement by Kumasaka Daishū
Ten ri from Chōyō, south of the great river, one sees from afar vermillion towers reflecting on the blue depths. The hundred-jō long bridge crosses from the north, and the sacred site of a thousand autumns is explored toward the west. The temple appearance of Gozu - who knows what guardian protects it? The immortal on crane's back cannot easily be spoken of. I can only say that divine power drives away evil spirits, and there are ritual celebrations of former kings - who could memorize them all?}}

《Side note: Zen Leisure Occasional Poems by Monk Zuika
Ancient divine mausoleums float on the water, who will again moor dragon boats at this vital crossing? The day when the Southern Court prince moved his army, the autumn when Duke Gongsun of the northern land spurred his horse. For ten thousand ri, wind and clouds escaped the tiger's mouth; for a thousand years, the state has worshipped Gozu. Even now at the riverside where lanterns are lit, one still imagines heroic souls wandering beneath the moon}}

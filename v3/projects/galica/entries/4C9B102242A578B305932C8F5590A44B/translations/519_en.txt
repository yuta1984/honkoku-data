《Same》
Rowing out from Tsushima crossing, so distant, traces fade behind the snowy island pines　　　Fujiwara no Mototoshi

《Nayose》  
The Ise people pull strongly; from Tsushima via Kai River to Izumi Plain　Kamo no Chōmei

《Waka Classification》
From Tsushima pushing the pole, crossing the long river past Kai River to Izumi Plain　　Saigyō Hōshi

《Jōō Kaidō Record
Departing Nanoka-ichi station and going down by boat to the place called Tsushima crossing, the young reed leaves are green
Crossing over, even untethered horses do not wander away, waves hide among the floating sedge leaves, but the lonely frogs have no desire to make noise, as drops from the passing pole fall on our sleeves》
Without particularly thinking of anything, my sleeves are wetted by unfamiliar waves on this familiar pole
《Having completed the crossing, we moved into Owari Province, etc.》

Shōichii Tsushima Gozu Tennō Shrine《Same village. Enshrined on Mukai Island. It appears in the Honkokuchō as Shōichii Tsushima Gozu Tennō, and is recorded as Shōichii-jō in the Kokufu-miya manuscript copied in Genki 2》

This shrine dates to the 45th year of Emperor Kōrei, the 7th human emperor, when the gentle spirit of Susanoo-no-mikoto, upon returning from Kankoku Island《According to Shoki Shūkai, Kankoku Island refers to Silla》, first stayed at Tsushima in the western seas, spending years at this place, and later in the first kinoto-hitsuji year of Emperor Kinmei, manifested divine presence on this sacred island.《Shiojiri quotes shrine records stating that the shrine was built during Emperor Saga's reign, suggesting construction during the Kōnin era, though this likely refers to repairs》

Therefore, the old name Fujinami-no-sato was changed to Tsushima.《Since Tsushima and Tsushima were used interchangeably in ancient times, it was so named》

Initially it was enshrined at Imori地, but《According to Namiai-ki, during Emperor Kinmei's reign, light appeared on Nakashima in Ama District, and when observed, it was among willow and bamboo》

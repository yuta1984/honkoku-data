Sōgorō Mound (Located in the same village. Long ago, a man named Hanai Sōgorō was killed by someone. His head was buried here, and it is commonly called Yumitori Mound. People suffering from malaria make small bows and arrows and hang them in front of the grave, and when they pray to it, it is said to be unfailingly effective.)

Insect Memorial Service (The fourteen villages of Nishiura and sixteen villages of Higashiura in this district take turns, one village per year, to conduct this service. The ritual form is the same for both east and west.)
To trace the origin of this memorial service: during the reign of Emperor Daigo, Eihimaru ruled over this land, and after that lord passed away, the villagers began worshipping and holding memorial services for him. The reason it is called "Insect Memorial Service" (perhaps it is similar to the Goryō Tsuji Festival mentioned in Lord Teika's Meigetsuki) is that farmers constantly kill insects in their rice fields and dry fields, so they perform Buddhist rites for the various insects, making this good deed into a memorial service for the deceased lord. The village whose turn it is opens the principal image of worship, the Amida Buddha triad (painted by Eshin Sōzu), on the seventh day of the first month, and during the autumn equinox of the eighth month (Nishiura on the first day, Higashiura on the middle day), they set up a memorial site and perform nembutsu hymns (keeping time with gongs and drums). This religious ceremony (Ryōnin Shōnin was born in this district and later propagated Yūzū Nembutsu. It is said that this might be a remnant of that tradition) is conducted entirely by lay people without using any monks (when performed at the beach it is called Beach Memorial Service, when conducted in the mountains it is called Mountain Memorial Service). A large temporary hut is constructed in the center and designated as the nembutsu memorial site, and small temporary huts (there are three, called dōjō) are placed

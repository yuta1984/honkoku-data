The Ancient Tale of the Hanai Mortar

In the house of a Chinese book dealer (whose family name was Hanai) in Honmachi First District, there had been a mortar passed down for many years. Around the spring of Meiwa 9 (1772), when they broke it apart to use as firewood, a strange fragrance spread in all directions. The neighbors were all surprised and came running to see it, discovering it was made of high-quality red sandalwood. They stopped burning it and kept it as a treasure, distributing small portions to friends and acquaintances. When Morikawa (someone) presented it to Lord Reizei Tamemura for certain reasons, His Lordship named the incense "Summer Garments."

In the hazy night / shadows like mist / in thin fabric / spilling fragrant / plum blossoms' scent
As days pass by / spring ends / summer begins today
Thin robes / pale purple / in the chinaberry shade
In the cool wind / autumn arrives / thin mist trailing
First tail flowers / faintly thin / evening begins
Over the pillow high / mountain wind / autumn moon clear
Koto's voice / winter night's geese / add their sound too
Sleeve and trees' / light autumn leaves / hurrying shower
Morning departure / garden's light snow / how rare
Traces of brush / lacking feeling / ink not thin
Letter's / promise when will / become thin
Thin partition's / humble house / rice-pounding mortar / mallet's song / singing voices

How interesting! He wrote in his own hand. When Fujio Kōtō added musical notation to this poem and sang it accompanied by koto, and His Lordship heard it, the Reizei family composed another poem and gave it to that kōtō player.

Relating to the name of the fragrant wood mortar, showing written words, Fujio Kōtō skillfully crafted the melody and accompanied it on koto

Putting heart into the melody of the sung song, we hear the koto's most unusual tuning

This kōtō player was from Owari Province. That he traveled all the way to the capital to perform this music must be due to no shallow connection of fate. Sumikaku

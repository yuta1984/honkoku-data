There was a request to establish a kakesho (branch temple), and with the permission of the domain, from the seventh month of Genroku 3 (1690), Senryū-ji Temple in Fukuro-machi was made into a kakesho. In the twelfth month of the same year, temple grounds were donated within Furuwatari Village, and the kakesho was moved to its current location. From around the summer of the same fifth year, they began constructing temple buildings. On the twelfth day of the fourth month of the same thirteenth year, the priest Ichinyo passed away at the main temple in Kyoto, and during the time of his son, the great priest Shinnyo, on the twenty-eighth day of the tenth month of the same fifteenth year, the construction was completed. The main hall and all other halls were completely renovated, but rather than making priest Shinnyo the founder, priest Ichinyo was designated as the founding abbot according to the original wish. ○Principal image: Amida Buddha

Furuwatari Old Castle: The grounds of the eastern kakesho are exactly where it once stood. Oda Bingo-no-kami Nobuhide resided at Nagoya Castle, but after the birth of his eldest son Nobunaga in Tenbun 3 (1534), he gave Nagoya Castle to Nobunaga and built a castle at Furuwatari where he moved. After Nobuhide's death, it became a ruined castle and was turned into rice fields, but later became the temple grounds of the kakesho. The Nobunaga-ki records that Lord Nobunaga came of age here, and Sōboku's Tōgoku Kikō records that when Sōboku traveled east regarding the imperial palace repairs, he was ordered to convey an imperial edict to the castle lord Nobuhide here. This gives us a glimpse of the warring states period. For details, I defer to the travel record and omit them here.

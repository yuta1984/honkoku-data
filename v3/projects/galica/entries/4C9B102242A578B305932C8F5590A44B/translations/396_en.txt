Visiting Sainen-ji Temple, presented to the Reverend Mokutei

Matsudaira Hazan

The taste of Jōshū's tea directly passes through the barrier
The pine wind from the ancient tripod is leisurely on summer days
In this temple courtyard there is no dust—
Not through sweeping, but the old monk's heart
Lies bare with only green mountains

In this manner, there was not a single person who could not be cured. This was a miraculous prescription aided by divine assistance, and represented the wonderful techniques passed down through generations at this temple. Originally, this temple was called Zōnanbō, but it was renamed Myōgan-in in the 9th year of Kan'ei (during the reign of Empress Meishō), when the Third Princess, daughter of the Retired Emperor (Go-Mizunoo-in), suffered from an eye ailment. The court physicians of Kyoto exhausted their techniques and presented rare medicines, but there was no effect whatsoever. However, it happened that the reputation of our temple's ophthalmology reached the imperial ear, so an edict was issued summoning the monk. The resident monk Enkyō respectfully received the imperial command, approached the throne, immediately inserted needles into the imperial eyes and presented sacred medicine. Within a short time, the condition was completely cured, and in his profound imperial gratitude, the beautiful name Myōgan-in was bestowed, along with tanzaku poetry cards from the imperial gathering, various tea utensils, and several dozen pieces of gold. All of this was accomplished through the benevolent vows and vast compassion of the Medicine Buddha, and was truly beyond human capability. Also, the 21st generation Hōin Enkai, on the 22nd day of the 10th month of Meiwa 3 (1766), treated the eye disease of the Second Prince of Emperor Momozono. The efficacy was the same as in Hōin Enkyō's time, so this too resulted in imperial gratitude and promotion to the rank of Gon-Sōjō. This

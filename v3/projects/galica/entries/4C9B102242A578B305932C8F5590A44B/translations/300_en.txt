(There is a folk tradition saying this is the "Naka no Mori" (Middle Forest) mentioned in the poem "ugisu no koe suru hodo wa isokarezumata michinaka no mori to omoedo" (When the warbler sings, do not hurry, though you may think it is a forest along the way), but since Seisetsumom is close to Omiya, it does not match the poem's meaning. Also, in Kaito District there are indeed places named Upper Forest, Middle Forest, and Lower Forest, but these are also far away and contradict the poem's meaning. Sakaki Forest seems to match the poem's meaning in terms of distance, but since there are many old theories that it is near Seisetsumom, I will tentatively record it here and await future investigation.)

Namida River (It is said to be in front of Seisetsumom according to Koranso. Because of an ancient poem "When I trace the Namida River to its source, it turns out to be drops from Awate Forest," which pairs it with Awate, this area is traditionally said to be the site of Namida River)

Kyuto-zan Shugetsuin Temple (Located east of the 25-jo Bridge on Tajima Lane. Soto Zen sect, branch temple of Daichūji in Tomita, Shimotsuke Province. The daughter of Imagawa Samanosuke Ujiyoshi, lord of Nagoya Castle, was the wife of Nakano Matahyōe-no-jō Shigeyoshi and took the Buddhist name Shugetsuin Keishū Daishi. Shigeyoshi was a retainer of Oda Nobuhide, one of the Seven Spears of Azukizaka in Mikawa Province, called "Nakano Tsuchi," renowned for his military prowess, and served both Lord Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hidetsugu. After Hidetsugu's forced suicide at Mount Koya, they retreated here, and the couple lived in seclusion while mourning their lord. When Shigeyoshi died on December 29, Keicho 3, his wife Shugetsuin followed his dying wish and built this temple on their estate grounds in Keicho 4. The resident monk Kenshitsu of Daichūji in Tomita, Shimotsuke Province, was Ujiyoshi's elder brother and Shugetsuin's uncle, so he was invited to be the founding abbot. She also passed away on July 6, Keicho 6.) The principal image is Yakushi Nyorai carved by Kobo Daishi, and a statue of Thousand-Armed Kannon is also enshrined.

Fudasen Entsu-ji Temple (Located at the southern end of Tajima Lane. Soto Zen sect, branch temple of Kensaiji in Totomi Province. Built by the Gon-guji family in Meitoku 2, with Seikai Gihon of Fusaiji Temple in Hamamatsu as founding abbot.) The principal image of the Zen hall is Yakushi Buddha. Chinchu Benzaiten Shrine, Akiba Shrine (A particularly large shrine called Hayasume Akiba. The festival is held on November 16-17 with crowds of worshippers, and there is a vigil hall where many people keep vigil on the night of the 16th. It is said that if you receive iron flint from this shrine and use it, there is no fear of fire, and the characters "Hayasume" are inscribed on the flint.)

Minami Shingu Tennō Shrine (Located opposite Seisetsumom in Gosho-no-maemachi. Enshrines Amaterasu Omikami and Susanoo-no-Mikoto. The grand festival floats on June 5 every year are for this shrine's divine festival. Subsidiary shrines Imori Shrine and Hachiōji Shrine are within the precinct. ○ Miyoshi no Miike pond is behind the shrine. ○ Shingu-zaka slope is on the southern road, all named after this shrine.) The festival features yamahoko floats, with one mountain float and two carts from eight locations within Atsuta taking turns by year.

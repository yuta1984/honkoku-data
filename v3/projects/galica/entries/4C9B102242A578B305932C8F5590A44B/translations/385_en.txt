《Note: A stone monument still exists at this temple. It appears as Noma Hōonji Temple in the Azuma Kagami, but now the temple records are lost and not transmitted. Originally it was Shingon sect, but in Eishō 12 (1515), a monk named Un'kai converted it to the current sect}}

Kon'ōmaru　Kutsuwa-arai (Bit-washing) Pond《Note: It was beside the road in Kita-Okuda village, but now it has mostly become farmland, with only about one ken square remaining of its former appearance. Though it is such a small pond, even now if anyone}}
《Note: wantonly trespasses upon it, they immediately fall ill with malaria, so the local people are greatly fearful. This is because when Kon'ōmaru was about to return to the capital, he washed his horse's bit in this pond, hence the name. Also, as the place where he discarded his banner, some flat land remains to the south》
{{Note: of it. No one puts a hoe into this either}}

Osada Crab (Osada-gani)《Note: Lives on Noma's seashore. Has markings like a human face on its shell. The local people exclusively tell the story that this is the vengeful spirit of Osada Tadamune, who was executed by Lord Yoritomo, transformed into a crab. However, what is called the tiger}}
{{Note: crab in crab catalogs - called Shimamura crab in Settsu Province and Bumon crab in the western seas - are all the same species as this Osada crab and existed originally. But perhaps Heaven, detesting Osada's wickedness, borrowed people's mouths to transmit his evil reputation to posterity}}
{{Note: How fearsome! How cautionary!}}

In the first year of Bunwa (1260), by imperial edict, an image of the Shō-Kannon from Shitennō-ji Temple in Settsu Province was copied to serve as the principal deity of this temple. Prince Tsuchimikado of the second rank, Nin'yu Hōshin-nō, son of the same emperor, served as the third abbot, making this an extraordinary imperial prayer temple. However, it fell into decline during the medieval civil wars. Lord Nobunaga donated land at Kitano as a temple lamp fund, but due to repeated fires over the years, it was lost, and so the temple was moved to its current location.

《Small text note: This temple has three lineages of dharma transmission. The first was inherited from Priest Jakuun of Anyō-ji Temple in Taki District, Ise Province, combining both Zen and esoteric Buddhism. The second is the dharma lineage of Shōchin Hōshin-nō, the head priest of Tōdai-ji Temple in Nara. The third is the dharma lineage of Chūshō-in at Negoroji in Kii Province. Among these, Anyō-ji is considered orthodox. When Zen Master Buttsū, disciple of National Master Shōichi, was abbot of Anyō-ji, he visited Ise Grand Shrine daily and received divine revelation that ritual impurity need not be avoided. Therefore, pilgrims to Ise Grand Shrine would first come to this temple to drink tea and purify themselves with fire before visiting the Grand Shrine. What is now called "Myōjō Tea House" is a remnant of this custom.》

When Zen Master Buttsū passed away, he bequeathed all his books on esoteric Buddhism and Zen studies to the priest Nōshin, which is why even today there are many old manuscripts at Ōsu. Now, this Nōshin was an eccentric person, and in the spring section of the "Zoku Genba-shū" anthology, a poem about falling blossoms appears: "Unable to disappear, still falling thickly, the white snow of blossoms touched by spring sunlight." ○ Principal deity 《Small text note: Shō-Kannon is from Settsu Province》

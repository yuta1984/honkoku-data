Now, this province (Owari) belongs to the Tokaido and faces the southern sea, located in the central part of great Japan between east and west (300-odd ri east to Matsumae and Ezo, 300-odd ri west to Osumi and Satsuma). The "Wamyo Ruijusho" records Owari Province (with the provincial capital in Nakashima District, seven days' journey upstream, four days downstream) as governing eight districts (managing 6,820 cho, 7 tan, 310 bu of rice fields, with 200,000 bundles each of regular tax and public office rice, 477,000 bundles of main rice, and 72,000 bundles of miscellaneous rice): Ama, Nakashima, Haguri, Niwa, Kasugabe, Yamada, Aichi, and Chita.

The "Engi Shuzei-shiki" records that Owari Province had 200,000 bundles each of regular tax and public office rice, 20,000 bundles for provincial temples, and 2,000 bundles for Monju ceremonies. Moreover, in Tanpo Osho's "Ruiju Orai," the Keicho 2 woodblock edition of "Ekirin's Setsuyoshu," the "Nihonkoku Seitō Zuki," and other works, it states that Owari Province has "thick earth and fertile soil where seeds multiply a thousandfold, with many excellent things in the villages, making it a great superior province of Japan." Later books also record it as "Japan's foremost superior province."

(The regulation of Ninjo 3, sixth month, eighth day in the "Ruiju Sandai-kyaku" states "Owari ranks among the superior provinces," and ancient texts like "Kanshoku Hisho," "Shokugensho," and "Jukaisho" also record Owari as a superior province because, according to the "Shokuin-ryo," provinces were measured for their extent and divided into four ranks—large provinces, superior provinces, middle provinces, and inferior provinces—and Owari was placed among the superior provinces.)

Thus praised as an excellent superior province within Japan, this was because the land of this province is fertile, producing not only the five grains and vegetables but also abundant birds and beasts, fish and turtles, timber, vessels, brocades, silk fabrics, and all other myriad things.

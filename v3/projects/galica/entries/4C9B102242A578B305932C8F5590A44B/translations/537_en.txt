《Side note: At the end of autumn in the 6th year of Eiroku (1563), when Lord Nobunaga was about to advance to West Mino and set up camp at Sunomata along the way, that night Fukutomi Heizaemon-no-jō's golden dragon mask went missing. While everyone was deliberating about who might have approached this area, it appeared as though Lord Tōkichi (Hideyoshi) was being suspected. Hideyoshi became greatly angered and resolved to capture the thief to clear his false accusation. He hurried to Tsushima and stopped at the house of a wealthy merchant named Hotta Mago'emon-no-jō. As expected, he easily captured the person who came to this house trying to pawn the aforementioned mask. In his great joy, believing this was entirely due to the divine protection of Gozu Tennō, he immediately went to worship before the sacred altar of Tennō shrine. He then promptly handed the thief over to the minor officials of Tsushima and returned to the main camp in West Mino. For more details, this account defers to Kose Hoan's Taikōki}}

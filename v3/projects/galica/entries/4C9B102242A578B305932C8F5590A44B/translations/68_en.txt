Kameō Tennō Shrine

On the kaishi paper offered when Lord Reizei Tamemura performed the star festival at this shrine:

Receiving the protection
of the year star

Nyūdō Former Dainagon Chōkaku

May it never cease—
this year's star
continues to protect,
taking as example
the long-tailed turtle's
mountain

Based on this, the high priest retired and withdrew from Jōraku-ji to this temple. This priest was of high virtue, and even the dragon deity was drawn to him, dedicating dragon lanterns to the pine before the gate every night during that time. Therefore, that pine is still called the Dragon Lantern Pine, and it is said that the mountain name "Ryūshō" (Dragon Pine) also originates from here. Also, in Tenshō 10 (1582), when the Divine Ruler (Tokugawa Ieyasu) descended from the capital and was supposed to proceed to Iwamura Jōraku-ji, he first landed at this village, and this temple provided guidance. ○ Main image: seated statue of Amida Buddha, created by Great Master Jikaku; Sacred treasures: Itobitei myōgō calligraphy by priest Kūren, being part of forty-eight name scrolls; Sūtra repository built during the Bunsei era. The scenic view of the sea from this temple's study hall is truly unparalleled.

Tokoishi Tenjin Shrine (located in Okujō village, commonly called Zaō Shrine): This is the shrine listed in the provincial records as "Junior Third Rank Tokoishi Tenjin." According to tradition, the shrine grounds were formerly located at Chiyogamine (north of the present shrine), but during the Meiō era (1492-1501) it was moved to the present location and named Mount Takamiya. There are also three shrine buildings in Tokoname district: the central shrine serves as the guardian deity of Daizen-ji temple in the same village, the western shrine is located in Hōjō village, and the high shrine is this very shrine. Although there are many historical records and traditional accounts regarding the former location of the shrine's establishment and years of reconstruction, these are omitted here.

Also, in the same poetry collection, it says "It has been nine days since leaving the capital," and the Owari no Kami Ōe no Masahira notes, "Having left the capital, today makes nine days - so we have arrived in the eastern provinces." Furthermore, in the extant "Waka Rokujō" (Six Books of Japanese Poetry), there is a poem about herons by the former Sesshō (regent) and Daijō Daijin (Grand Minister): "Having finished harvesting the early rice of the leading marshlands, the waters of Aichi have become clear," which shows that good water springs forth here. (In this Man'yōshū long poem, it should read "Oharita" but printed editions mistakenly write "Onumata," confusing "harita" with "numata." Since this error is ancient, this minister likely composed his poem following this tradition.)

Nagoya Prefecture: In the colophon of the "Kōbō Daishi Gonyūjō Kanketsu-ki" (Record of Kōbō Daishi's Eternal Meditation Decision) held at Shinpuku-ji in Nagoya (called Ōsu Kannon), it states: "At this time, on the ninth day of the middle of Ōshō in the third year of Jōji era, I endured the cold and completed copying this at the altar site of Anyō-ji in Nagoya-no-shō, Owari Province." As this shows, in ancient times it was written as "Nagoya" and was merely a small village estate, but after the lord established his castle there, it came to be written as "Nagoya" and became a vast and prosperous metropolis, with the main road from the Tōkaidō to the Minoji passing through its center.

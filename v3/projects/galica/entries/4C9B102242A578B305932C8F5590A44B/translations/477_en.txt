Komachi Mound

On the 20th day of the 9th month, while passing through the village called Araya, for some reason the villagers have long said that there is a small mound in the rice fields where Ono no Komachi once lay. The maple leaves under the trees of that mound were beginning to turn red, and the pampas grass and such were withering, appearing most melancholy, so:

　　　Kōmon

The mound of the ancient capital's beautiful maiden grows lonely, and the wind of deepening autumn pierces to the bone

　　Kakusō
Though withered, the pampas grass still retains its spirit

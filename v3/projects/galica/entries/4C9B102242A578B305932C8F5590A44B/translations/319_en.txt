Sanda Munin Family Traditional Medicine Senjusan
This family has lived in Higashi-Ano Village for generations. Their famous medicine Senjusan is a miraculous cure for jaundice, with constant demand from far and near. When poor people come seeking it, they give it freely without asking for payment, not accepting even a single sen. Since the Keichō period (1596-1615), they have occupied this homestead, calling themselves Munin for generations and building a grand mansion. When daimyo from western provinces travel up and down, they often rest at this house. The domain lord also stops by and grants audiences. During the Korean embassy visits of the Enkyō and Hōreki periods, they also entered this house to rest. In Enkyō 5 (1748), when the three envoys rested at this house on their return journey, it was June 23rd and the heat was extreme. When each requested water, the master gave them kudzu water, and all were greatly pleased, immediately forgetting the blazing heat. To thank the master for his kindness, everyone presented poems, calligraphy, paintings, and other works. Among these, the poetry of Kyōkanshō and ink paintings by Seigan were particularly numerous and are still preserved as family treasures today. There are many poems and writings, so they are omitted here. Those with scholarly interests should visit the house to request viewing.

Sakai River Bridge
This is the bridge connecting the two provinces of Owari and Mikawa. It spans the lower reaches of Sakai River that flows through Aichi District, which is the present-day Tōkaidō. Most ancient poems sing of the upper reaches of the river, but what is presented here are poems from after the current bridge was built. "Tōkō Wasetsu" records that this river is the border river between Owari and Mikawa, with an earthen bridge on the eastern side and a half-plank bridge on the western side. Neither province is particularly poor, yet this has been the custom since ancient times.

From "Kokin Ikyoku-shū":
Crossing over Owari Province's border bridge—could this be the seam of the river?　　　Lord Karasumaru Mitsuhiro

From "Tōkaidō Kikō":
Going along, there was a river, and when asked, they said it was the border river between Mikawa and Owari provinces, saying we had now entered Owari Province. Today being the 30th of September:
Though I have not traveled the eastern road to its end, today, today indeed is the finish　　Kobori Masakazu

From "Kōshi Michi no Ki":
There was a thin stream called Sakai River with a single earthen bridge. As the person who had come to see me off was returning, I wrote a letter to someone in Owari:
What was painful is now dear to me—thinking that I have surely left the village where I lived　　Bujo

Seiryōzan Sōgen Temple
Located in Ōwaki Village, this is a Sōtō Zen temple, a branch temple of Saimyō Temple in Mikawa Hachiman Village. Iun Oshō is considered the founding priest, but the exact year and month of establishment is unclear. In the Netsuta Shrine territory report of Bunwa 3 (1354), April 23rd, it appears as Ōwaki-gō, indicating it is an ancient place name.

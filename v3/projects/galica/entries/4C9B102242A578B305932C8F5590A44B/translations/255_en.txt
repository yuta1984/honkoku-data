The "Nihon Shoki," in the Chronicle of Emperor Tenmu, records: "In the sixth month, day of Boshin, in the first year of Shuchō era, when the Emperor's illness was divined, it was attributed to the curse of the Kusanagi sword, and on the same day it was sent and placed at Atsuta Shrine in Owari Province." This divine sword is one of Japan's Three Sacred Treasures and had been with the imperial family since the age of the gods. It was stored at Ise Grand Shrine during the reign of Emperor Sujin, then entrusted to Yamato Takeru-no-mikoto during the reign of Emperor Keikō, and from then until now has been enshrined at this shrine, serving eternally as the guardian of the imperial nation.

This shrine is indeed the mausoleum of Emperor Chūai, and from ancient times the shrine buildings have been vast in scale, the sacred grounds also deep and remote, with thousand-year-old trees luxuriantly covering the sky and verdant branches deeply intertwining. It is said that the many birds that come and go in this forest never leave any defiling droppings.

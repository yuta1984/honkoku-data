The name "Hana-naru" comes from the fact that the local castle lord Oda Bingo-no-kami Nobuhide (Buddhist name: Tōgan) personally grafted the trees. During the castle construction, this temple's grounds served as the construction site for the Kaga family, and many letters exchanged with retainers like Yokoyama Yamashiro-no-kami from that time are preserved at this temple.

Nanbō Kenuki (Southern Tweezers) is known as Nagoya kenuki and is a famous specialty. When Ashikaga Yoshinori viewed Mount Fuji and stayed at Enpuku-ji in Atsuta, a blacksmith from Furuwatari presented him with tweezers. The lord said "These are fine southern tweezers," which led to the adoption of this as the family name, as recorded in the Hakka Zuihitsu. Okada Teinosuke composed a verse about Furuwatari in his Chōen Eimono-shi: "The people surnamed Nanbō are skilled at tempering swords, the village named Furuwatari naturally ferries boats."

From Kyōka Shinsun-kyō:
The fickle human heart like flower tweezers - even Southern regrets, there's no return now - Koha

Kuragarinomori Hachiman Shrine is located on the north side of Furuwatari Bridge street. The enshrined deities are Emperor Ōjin and Empress Jingū, and it's said that the spirit of Chinzei Hachirō Tametomo is also worshipped there. In Eishō 18 (1521), six monks and laypeople led by Tsurumi Michichika joined forces to restore it. In the Genroku era, the mother of someone named Ishiguro composed: "The trees planted long ago have aged through the years, and even moonlight cannot penetrate this dark forest." Even now, with ancient trees growing thickly, it remains a shrine dark even in broad daylight. The auxiliary shrines include Kasuga Shrine, Inari Shrine, Shinmei Shrine, and Benten Shrine. The regular festivals are the Crow Festival on the first Horse Day of the second month and the festival on the first Dragon Day of the eleventh month.

Furuwatari Bridge spans the Horikawa river west of Kuragarinomori. The old Furuwatari bridge mentioned in ancient poems was not this one - until recently, old bridge pilings lay across the ditch between Inumidō and the Inari shrine.

- both references relate to this temple. In ancient times, it had seventy-two monk quarters and extensive temple lands donated by Shōgun Takauji, making it a prosperous ancient temple. However, during the time of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the lands were confiscated, and after the fire in the twelfth year of Kan'ei, it fell into decline. Koze Hoan's Taikōki states: "During the reign of Emperor Go-Yōzei, there was a man called Taikō-daijin Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Rising from humble beginnings, he was outstanding throughout history, truly an extraordinary great talent. [omission] At the age of eight, he became a disciple of Kōmyōji Temple in the same province, but he was unfamiliar with monastic rules. According to popular opinion, his wisdom surpassed that of the world, and he particularly loved stories of military valor. Thinking that monks should not stray from being mendicants, he acted according to his own will in all matters and had a disposition that made the monks dislike him. As expected, [the monks said] 'No, no, this child's temperament will never make him a monk; rather, he will become an obstacle to the Buddhist law.' The assembly unanimously decided and sent him back to his father." [omission] The Shiojiri states: "At Kōmyōji Temple in Kayazu village, monks of the esoteric sect once resided. Around that time, Saint Ippen, during his travels around the country, performed the six-time ritual worship at Jimokuji Temple."

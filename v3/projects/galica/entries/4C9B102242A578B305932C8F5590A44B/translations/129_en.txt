Inu-midō (Dog Hall) Hōjō-ji Kekō-in Temple (Located on the southwest side of Ōkido. Shingon sect, branch temple of Ōsu Shinpuku-ji) The founding priest was Mukan (secular surname Taira, who became a monk at Mount Kōya in Kii Province). While traveling through various provinces for ascetic training, he came to this place during the Juei era. When his body became exhausted and he was tormented and about to expire, two dogs, one black and one white, appeared and brought grass leaves soaked with water in their mouths, pouring it into the monk's mouth. He immediately revived and his body and mind became refreshed. The monk thought: "The dogs are messengers of Kōya Daimyōjin, so this is purely the protection of the deity." Knowing this, and having received a divine dream revelation from Amida Nyorai, he built a grass hermitage here, created and enshrined images of Amida Buddha and the two black and white dogs, naming it Inu-midō.

(According to Shingon Kogi, black and white dogs are placed beside the fire altar (goma-dan). This is because when Kōbō Daishi first entered Mount Kōya, there were two dogs that guided him, so dog images are placed beside the altar. In Shiojiri, the diagram of Kōya Shisho Myōjin shows two black and white dogs painted at the foot of the stairs. This represents when Kūkai climbed Mount Kōya during the Kōnin era - two dogs guided him, and a transformed being bearing bow and arrows pointed to the mountain. After the temple was built, this was worshipped under the name Kariba Myōjin. This depicts the original form, as esoteric Buddhist monks explain. Since this Inu-midō is also of the Shingon sect, it appears the two dogs were placed beside the principal image as guardians. Additionally, there was once a person who kept and loved a dog. When he took it to the mountains and slept under a large tree, the dog suddenly barked at its master and pulled at his clothes. The master found this strange and suspected "Does it want to devour me?" and drew his sword...)

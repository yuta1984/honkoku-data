Kōmyōji Temple

Fukada Masamuro

At Kobayashiyama Kōmyōji Temple, I encountered an idle monk and asked about the old days. From when the priest Busshō came to this place until now, the temple buildings stand magnificently.

Scheme/Plan:
With gold
Making Buddha [statues]
The temple's name too

Universally in this world
Shines brightly

Baisa-en (Tea Garden)

In the temple's founding legend too
The imperishable fame
Like blooming irises
Of the Ariwara [lineage]
Seeking that
Heritage

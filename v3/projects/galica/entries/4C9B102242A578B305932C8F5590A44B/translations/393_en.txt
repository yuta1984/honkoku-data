Hachiman Shrine: Located in Taya village, the shrine grounds are called Mount Sankusu. It was built in Hōan 4 (1123), year of the Water Rabbit.

Onigasaki (Demon Cape): Located in Enokido village, it extends into the sea to the southwest, so the view opens up and the scenery is especially fine. Also, there are many small pines on the sandbar, and the spectacular sight of white waves from the blue sea breaking against the green of the pines is truly beyond description.

Shōkōzan Ryūun-ji Temple: Located in the same village (Enokido), it belongs to the Rinzai sect and is a branch temple of Akemi Shimizu-ji in Mino. In Enpō 4 (1676), Takekoshi Yamashiro-no-kami moved and established it from a ruined temple in Sotohara village, Kasugai district. Main image: seated statue of Shakyamuni Buddha. Temple treasures: golden folding screens with paintings of the seventy-two seasonal periods owned by the Takekoshi family; dragon plaque donated by the same family, with the painted dragon said to occasionally emerge and visit the pond in the garden. ○ Because there is a memorial tablet for Ryūun-ji-den Daian Sanshin Koji, this became the temple name. There are eight scenic spots within the precincts: Donkai Gate, Uzuki Inlet, Lotus Leaf Pond, Rainbow Bridge, Ichiran Peak, Shingo Pine, Kongō Spring, and Distant Returning Sails.

Metal Caster: Located in Kume village, generations have worked in metal casting. They possess an imperial decree granted in Tenpuku 1 (1233), November. During the reign of Emperor Konoe, when Minamoto no Sanmi Yorimasa shot down the nue (mythical creature), he ordered this caster to make golden lanterns, which were hung on trees in the imperial garden to see where the nue would fall, and thus received a reward. The detailed record is written and stored in that family, but the accuracy of this is uncertain.

Ichiya Tenjin Shrine: Located in Kita-Kasuya village, it enshrines Ise, Atsuta, Hachiken, Kumano, Tado, Hachiman, Tennō, and Gendayū, and is therefore called Hassho Gongen (Eight Places Avatar). It is listed in the provincial records as "Senior Fourth Rank Kunugi-ya Tenjin."

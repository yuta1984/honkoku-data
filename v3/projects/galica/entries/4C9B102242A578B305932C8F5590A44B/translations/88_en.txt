Murasaki River (referring to a small ditch with a stone bridge in Ōkubo-machi) At Yoko-Mitsukura, within the precincts of Denkōin Temple, there is an ancient five-story stone pagoda said to be the grave of Murasaki Shikibu, and the ditch that flows from there is said to have been named after her (however, there is no mention in ancient books of Murasaki Shikibu's grave being here, and there are no reliable legends, so it is uncertain).
(In girls' temari songs, they sing "throwing oneself into Murasaki River, the body sinks as a body, the kosode robe floats away as a robe" and so forth - this is an ancient custom, so in olden times it must have been a great river with depths deep enough to drown in. Now it is merely a small ditch.)

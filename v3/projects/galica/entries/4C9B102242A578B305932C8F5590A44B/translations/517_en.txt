[Annotation: This present seated diagram is one of those. Due to deep karmic connections, it was received as a gift from Seiun-in temple in Yamada, Ise Province, and is enshrined at this temple. For further details, please refer to the Gyōgyōki (Record of Religious Practices) and Gizanjin's述奨記 (Shushōki), which are omitted here. The deeds of the high priest are described in detail at his birthplace in Taisei Village, Kaisai District.]

Ōi Shrine [Located in Inui Village. The Honkoku-chō records it as "Fourth Rank Lower Ōi Tenjin." The same collection states: "In Hoho-no-shō there is a shrine to Inui Village Myōjin. Perhaps the character for 'dog' (inu) is an error."]

Tsushima Village [Its ancient name was said to be Fujinami-no-sato, as seen in various texts. Now it is called Tsushima Village. It is the greatest settlement in western Owari, with over fifty streets running lengthwise and crosswise, where merchant houses, farmers, and artisans line up their eaves, lacking nothing among all goods. Moreover, since boat traffic to the Mino and Ise routes never ceases daily, travelers from various provinces gather here, creating unprecedented prosperity. It can truly be called a metropolis. The Azuma Kagami, in the entry for the second day of the second month of Buniji 4, records: "Regarding the matter of Shuridaifu's family at Tsushima Shrine in Owari Province, Itagaki-no-kanja failed to manage the temple affairs properly." Many other works mention this place name, but due to the complexity of the matter, they are omitted here.]

Tsushima Crossing [This was the ancient sea route from Ise to this province. The Moshiogusa mentions Owari, and the Meisho Hōgaku-shō states: "To go from Ise to Owari, there is a place called Tsushima-no-watari north of Kuwana. It is a famous place. [middle portion omitted] From Tsushima, one goes up to Orizu post station and then to Atsuta. This is the Tōkaidō. The distance between Tsushima and Orizu is four ri. From Orizu to Atsuta is five ri." Mano Tokitsuna's Tsushima Festival Record states: "The route passed south of Kayazu, went up to Nagaho Village, and proceeded through Kai River and Izumino in Suzuka District of Ise. Nagaho Village is a place called Nagaiki between Kuwana and Yokkaichi. The sea route from Umatsu port to this Nagaho was called Tsushima-no-watari. When traveling east from Kyoto, ships departed from Nagaho Village, stopped at present-day Ichiwaki Island, and arrived at Kayazu - this was also called Tsushima-no-watari. The Ise Meisho Shūi-shū records that Izumino was where those traveling from Tsushima in Owari to Kyoto would board boats, land at Nagaho Village, then cross Kai River, pass through Yuge Izumi Village, and emerge onto the main highway."]

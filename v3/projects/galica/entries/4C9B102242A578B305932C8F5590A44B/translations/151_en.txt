reaching Ajima. One source flows from Utsu (called Utsu River) through Matsumoto and Degawa, joining the downstream waters of the Tamano River at Kamijo Village. One emerges from Kamo District in Mikawa Province, passes through Seto, Akatsu, Yamada, and Yasui (here called Yada River), then at Inō the two streams converge to form this great river. From here downstream it flows through Manba and Isshiki to enter the sea (since this river water flows through both Shinogi and Kashiwai estates, it is collectively called the Shōnai River). In normal times this river is a clear, cold flowing stream, particularly prized by tea masters for its water quality (during prolonged rains and heavy downpours, when floods spread extensively, striking the banks and soaking the embankments with fierce water force, many large stones are placed on the bridge, and at night watch fires are lit on the embankments for guard duty. Stone posts are naturally erected below the embankments to gauge the water's rise and fall. Considering that before the Genna era there was ferry boat crossing, but during floods the water force was so strong that boats could not pass - this is known from the literary content of records like the Nagoya Battle Chronicle and the Nobunaga Chronicle).

The detailed history is deferred to the "Record of the Vegetable Morning Market" and omitted here). Generally, markets operate every morning throughout the year, with seasonal vegetables and dried goods competing for freshness and rarity. The famous products of this province go without saying (beginning with the daikon radishes of Miyashige and Hōryō, the varieties of famous products are extremely numerous and there is no time to enumerate them all, so this is omitted entirely, and the shape and flavor of each item is shown in detail under the entry for its place of origin). Products from Mino, Mikawa, Ise, Suruga, Kyoto, and Osaka all gather here, with all manner of goods forming mountains each morning (handling all goods in this way, it is known in the world as a "universal wholesaler" with prestigious standing). Merchants making purchases gather like ants, and in a short time

Niiya River《Small text: Located in the same village. Its source is the Tōgenji River in Nakajima District, and fish and turtles are extremely abundant. In autumn, many people from the castle town come for recreational fishing. Niiya Bridge is a bridge on the Tsushima Road spanning this river. This river also has a deep pool, and at some time during military conflicts, bandits stole a bronze bell and came here, but finding it too heavy to carry away, they sank the bell in this river. Gradually the river filled with sediment and the bell disappeared from view, according to local oral tradition. In the Kai Meishō-shi (Records of Famous Places in Kai), it records that in Araya Village, Tsuru District, there is a Bell Pool where during the Tenshō period, when Takeda and Hōjō forces battled, a camp bell was sunk in this pool. Comparing this, here it's called "Niiya" village and there "Araya" village, but both use the same characters "新屋" (New House), and both having the same Bell Pool is quite remarkable. Just as China's Songjiang is famous for sea bass, our Matsue in Izumo Province also produces this fish as a renowned delicacy - such coincidences are truly remarkable}}

Takamiya Shrine《Small text: Located in Futsutera Village. Re-roofed by Fukushima Masanori in the ninth month of Keichō 15 (1610). The enshrined deity is Ōhirume-no-muchi-no-mikoto, with the annual festival on the 18th day of the 8th month. This shrine has an old ridge-beam tablet with the text: "For the construction and consecration of this local shrine and worship hall, with prayers for present-world safety, long military fortune, defeat of enemies, and national prosperity. At Takamiya in Futatera, Kaitō District, Owari Province, for the shrine relocation, protector Yamada Sukesaku, great patron Hashiba Shōshō Fujiwara Masanori of Aki Province, 5th day of 9th month of Keichō 15 (1610), master carpenter Kiyosu Katsuzaemon, repair work by Jiuemon." Also in the same village are Kaze-no-miya Shrine and Tsuki-no-miya Shrine, both restored by Masanori}} Shrine priest《Small text: Yokohashi family}}

Site of Fukushima Sangi Masanori's Residence《Small text: Located in the same village. Masanori's childhood name was Ichimatsu. Originally the eldest son of a carpenter named Yozaemon from this village, he killed someone in his youth and hid in Medeta Temple, then relied on the Akabayashi family of Niiya Village to flee to Odawara, where he served under Hōjō Saemon-no-Dayū. Due to his connection with Lord Hideyoshi, when that lord began his rise to power, Masanori was recalled to service. Following the lord, in the 4th month of Tenshō 11 (1583), he distinguished himself in the vanguard assault on Mount Shizugatake in Ōmi Province, and from then his military reputation grew daily. His achievements are too numerous to count. In the 11th month of the same year, he was granted court rank as Saemon-no-Dayū, and thereafter resided in Kiyosu Castle in this province. In the 6th month of Genna 3 (1617), he was appointed Sangi with Junior Third Rank and became lord of Aki and Bingo Provinces with 498,000 koku, but his end was not complete - on the 2nd day of 6th month of Genna 5 (1619), his domains were confiscated, and he was granted 45,000 koku in Echigo and Shinano Provinces. Soon after, on the 13th day of 7th month of Kan'ei 1 (1624), he died at age 64. He was truly a rare fierce general whose courage was unmatched, but perhaps due to his pride in supporting the eastern forces during the Keichō 5 (1600) rebellion and subsequent inappropriate behavior, his family name...}}

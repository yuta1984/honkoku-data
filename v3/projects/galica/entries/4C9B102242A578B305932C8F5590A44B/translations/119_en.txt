Nanatsu-ji (Seven Temples)

Passing by Chōfuku-ji to admire the weeping begonia

By Yamamura Yoshiyoshi (from Seion-rō Shishō)
Where are the famous flowers at the edge of the five clouds?
Like willow branches drooping down, sweeping across the railings
Their fragrance drifts from beside the golden incense burner to the pure realm
Their color invades the jade dust, enhancing pure joy
Waves seem to rise in the air, making one suspect the robes are wet
Though snow flies in mid-spring, the wind is not cold
Further venerating the Buddha king deep in the cavern
Wandering about, seeing everything as the white tuft of hair [between Buddha's eyebrows]

Deep green
Darkening
    Old pine        Kiing
Among the trees    Cuckoo
  Autumn colors     With one call
  So deep in hue    [cry out]
    Indeed          Nanatsu-ji

Beito (from Kyūjō-shū Appendix)
Brighter than      Morning time—
other places       Temple cleaning
  The forest       while flower viewing (Shirō, from Biwa-en Kushū)
at seven o'clock dawn
illuminated
  Cherry          Uchō
  blossoms        At first blossoms
    at their peak  A mat with
                   fine pleated patterns

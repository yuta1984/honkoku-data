《Side note: The great festival of this shrine during the two days in summer is a magnificent spectacle known throughout the world. Not only from our province (Owari), but among the many pilgrims from other provinces, the devotion from the Kantō region is particularly strong, and crowds inevitably come to participate on this day. Therefore, more than half of the merchant houses in this area become inns to accommodate travelers, and shrine priest families also host various provincial temple supporters and large pilgrimage groups}}

《Side note: They stay packed so tightly there isn't even room to stick an awl. Moreover, people also come here by sea routes from the provinces of Ise, Mikawa, and Tōtōmi, so the Tennōgawa River is filled with thousands of sightseeing boats. Also, on the embankments, viewing platforms of various families are erected everywhere without space to spare, and the crowds of pilgrims on water and land are as dense as rice and hemp plants. Therefore, temporary stalls selling famous local products such as fans and agata (medicine) are set up starting from in front of the shrine priests' gates for several blocks, selling these as souvenirs for the return journey from pilgrimage. Truly, this day represents the greatest bustling activity of our region, beyond what words or brush can describe, but we have illustrated just one ten-thousandth of it to provide a glimpse for contemplation}}

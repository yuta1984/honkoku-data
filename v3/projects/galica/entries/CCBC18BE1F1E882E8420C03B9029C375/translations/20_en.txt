【Explanatory text below】
This illustrated scroll of the Complete Map of Pleasure Quarters Throughout Great Japan was created when Needle-Phallus Karihira Ason, during his journey eastward, practiced the ways of pleasure throughout various provinces, extensively trying both upper and lower openings, and established prices for courtesans to assist those engaged in amorous pursuits. The paintings are by the brush of Tosa's Marahei.

The quality of openings in Japan's provinces:
Tōkaidō is the Superior Opening Way, and its flavor is extremely good
Saikaidō is the Wife Opening Way, and its flavor is peaceful, good for taking as a wife
Nankaidō is the Difficult Opening Way, so opening is difficult and the flavor is bad
Hokurikudō is the Pouch Mouth Way, with a flavor like tightening a pouch's mouth, this is what is immediately called a drawstring purse
Nakasendō is the Middle Bias Way, so the opening interior is warm and the flavor is good
San'yōdō is the Three-Use Way, using three fingers, so the opening is wide and the flavor is bad
San'indō is the Birth Bias Way, with many post-birth opening disturbances, so its flavor is bland

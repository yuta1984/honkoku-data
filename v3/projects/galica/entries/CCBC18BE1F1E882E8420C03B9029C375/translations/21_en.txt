【Title】Courtesan Umegae's Hairless Mortar

【Main Text】
The courtesan Umegae is the foremost kidney-endowed one in the Kantō region, with muscular sinews and a thick male member's stem. She is a spirited fellow who has emerged, and this mortar here is like (grinding) miso.

At the edge of the brothel's veranda, she once fastened helmet-shaped cords and tied them to the constriction of the stem's joint. Umegae, who shook and lifted her hips energetically from below, had her treasure easily split without difficulty.

At this time, the quiver-bearing gentleman, without the particular likes and dislikes of insects that eat knotweed, randomly handling pumpkins this year, plucking from the bottom of his purse, and when offering the three treasures, he would leave his duties and release water ridiculously abundantly. This is his vow to achieve fame in the second hunt at Tanomori.

"They say that when you engage in pleasure, money rains from above, so there's nothing like this plum. This is what they call a real money-raining night with ■ and saltiness. By the way, what a strange thing this heir business is."

"Since we've accumulated hairless money, I thought leather-covered coins might fall, but it's just ordinary money after all. Tonight I'll spend only 300 ryō, so prepare yourself accordingly."

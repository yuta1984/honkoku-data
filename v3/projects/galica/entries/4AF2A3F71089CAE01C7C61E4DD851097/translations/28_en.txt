Hieronymus was the Emperor's brother. Before this, he had married a princess of Württemberg.
At this point, Napoleon returned triumphantly to Paris, and in 1807 (the 5th year of Bunka, year of Tsuchinoe-tatsu in our country), on October 27th of that year, he secretly made peace with Spain at Fontainebleau, preventing them from rescuing Portugal, and immediately led troops to attack Portugal. While outwardly maintaining the appearance of peace with Spain, he secretly dispatched troops to attack them, taking Etruria (Tuscany) and annexing it to France. He issued strict orders prohibiting trade with Britain. This caused great harm to them and drove them into dire straits.

attacked them. This caused their military forces to be divided and become increasingly weak. Moreover, the battles at the two locations of Heilsberg and Ostrołęka brought no military advantage, and the Battle of Friedland was also lost. As a result, Russia and Prussia finally sued for peace with France. On July 7th, they made a pact at Tilsit. Prussia agreed to lose over 4 million soldiers and to pay a large amount in reparations, and until the full payment of this silver was completed, they pledged several strong fortresses to France as collateral. At this point, the French Emperor granted part of the Duchy of Warsaw to the King of Saxony, and granted part of the new kingdom of Westphalia to Hieronymus.

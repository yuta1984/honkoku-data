The army retreated in defeat. On the 29th, "Bülow's" (personal name) entire army turned against them. The Swedish Crown Prince led troops into Germany. On September 6th, Napoleon withdrew his forces from "Dresden" and entered "Leipzig."
This was because he feared the enemy would cut off France's retreat route.
The French army found no advantage in every battle, and on the 16th both armies engaged, on the 18th the entire French army was defeated again, and on the 19th more than half of his troops retreated across the Rhine River. After Napoleon's great defeat at "Hanau," he finally returned to Saint-Cloud.

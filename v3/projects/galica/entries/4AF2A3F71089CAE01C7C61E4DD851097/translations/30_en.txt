He established this arrangement. He also granted the Grand Duchy of Berg to the young son of the King of Holland. The Russian Emperor met with Napoleon at Erfurt and further reinforced their previous alliance. Meanwhile, Britain, seeing France seize Spain, despised this action and raised troops to attack France. On October 29th, Napoleon went to that land and defeated the British. Hearing that Austria had also raised troops and was coming to attack, he quickly turned his forces to deal with this threat. Emperor Francis of Germany, having been repeatedly defeated by France, still desired to raise troops to avenge his long-standing enmity, and on April 9th, 1809 (the 7th year of Bunka, year of Kanoe-uma in our country), sent a declaration of war to Napoleon.

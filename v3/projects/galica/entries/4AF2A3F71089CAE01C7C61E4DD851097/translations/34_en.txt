[Napoleon] gradually devoured Europe, and although most of it came to obey his commands, the war with Spain was not yet finished, and England had not yet been able to achieve complete victory in battle. Russia, too, although now reconciled with our country, had unfathomable intentions. At this point, in 1811 (the 9th year of Bunka in our country, the year of Mizunoe-saru), Russia and Austria once again raised armies to attack France. France greatly prepared its military forces to defend against this. The Austrian forces quickly conquered several German states. However, the various fortresses of Prussia and "Danzig" still belonged to France. At this time, in the regions of Germany and Poland, the military forces of various nations gathered like clouds under Napoleon's great banner.

[Princess Yūchishi composing a seven-character regulated verse]
In the third month of spring in the sixth year of Jōhei era, a flower banquet was held in the Shishin-den (Purple Hall). Originally, the flower banquet was modeled after the imperial examination system of foreign countries (China), and began when Emperor Saga held a banquet under the flowers during an imperial visit to Shin-sen'en Garden in the third year of Kōnin era. At that time, Princess Yūchishi, who was serving as the Kamo Saiin (sacred priestess), composed a seven-character regulated verse using the rhyme scheme of "tōkō kōsō."

"Quietly, quietly, in the secluded villa, lost among the trees by water / The divine palanquin descends once to the pond"

【Farmers Interrogating Okiyo】
Okiyo, Governor of Musashi Province, was still a brave and fierce general, but when his luck ran out, he became afraid for his life and fled aimlessly, letting his feet carry him wherever they would. At a place called Ikita in Kazusa Province, he was spotted and questioned by farmers. Though he made various excuses, the farmers would not listen at all, saying "You false court noble, know your place!" and each grabbed farming tools to beat him nearly to death.

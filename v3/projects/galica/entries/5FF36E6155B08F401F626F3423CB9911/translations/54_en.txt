[Mikuriya Saburō Masayori Fighting Valiantly]

Masayori thought, "I never expected the enemy to advance this far." He had assumed it would merely be an exchange of whistling arrows in ritual combat, but when arrows were shot at him in earnest, he was startled and retreated about half a ri. At that point, Shigemori's concealed force of over 800 mounted warriors attacked from the flank, shouting loudly. They surrounded Masayori in the center, attacking fiercely so he could not escape. Masayori's troops fled in panic, each trying to be first to escape, and the number of those killed was beyond counting.

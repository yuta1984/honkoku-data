[Illustration of Taira no Sadamori's procession]
Here there was a man called Takiguchi Kojirō Sōma Masakado, who was the great-grandson of Emperor Kanmu and son of the former general Yoshimasa. His character was violent and unruly, and he knew nothing of proper etiquette.
Masakado had a cousin named Taira no Sadamori, who had been visiting Nin'naji Temple. When someone came approaching with many attendants in procession, clearing the way around them, thinking it might be an imperial prince or nobles from the regent families, he knelt down respectfully by the roadside.

【Tsugawa Heiroku Sadakane】
Naming himself Dōgen, both sides spurred their horses together, parrying and deflecting each other's attacks for about two toki (approximately four hours) of battle. Thinking "How long shall we continue creating sin, and what purpose does it serve?", they quietly loosened their upper sashes and stabbed each other in mutual death. Heiroku Sadakane was fifty-six years old, and Tōjō Nyūdō was sixty-two years old - it was such a splendid warrior's death that there was no one who did not admire it.

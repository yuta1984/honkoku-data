[Cockfighting]

All manner of imperial precautions were extraordinary. Around that time, people of all social ranks in the capital were exclusively engaged in the sport of cockfighting, which gradually became more intense. They raised many roosters and set up fighting rings with four pillars, bringing roosters daily to make them fight. The price of a single rooster was no less than ten thousand coins, and people eventually began to neglect their regular occupations. The court nobles deliberated and concluded that the popularity of such strange practices was also a portent of impending rebellion, so they strictly prohibited this sport and changed the era name to Tengyō.

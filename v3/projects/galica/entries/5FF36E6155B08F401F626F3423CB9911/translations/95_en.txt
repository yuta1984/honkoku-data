【Jōzō Performing the Rite of Daiitoku】
In the first month of Tenkyō 3, for prayers to subjugate the imperial enemies, the noble priest Jōzō of Ungo-ji temple was commanded to perform the Daiitoku ritual at Yokogawa. Miraculously, the figure of Masakado appeared on the altar platform, bearing bow and arrows, writhing in agony and tumbling headfirst into flames, dancing wildly - a sight that even the accompanying monks could see. This was truly regarded as a blessed miracle indicating that the imperial enemy would perish and all people would rejoice in peace.

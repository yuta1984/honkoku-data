"You have descendants who serve as guardians of the golden palace (heavenly palace). You should depart quickly and return to your homeland." When the deity spoke thus, Prince Sadazumi's figure suddenly transformed into a white dragon over five jō in length, churning up white waves and entering the water's depths. Upon seeing this, Ujimitsu awakened from his dream. Feeling this to be most strange, Ujimitsu went to Momozono Palace to see, and found that the Prince had already passed away. It was indeed a mysterious occurrence.

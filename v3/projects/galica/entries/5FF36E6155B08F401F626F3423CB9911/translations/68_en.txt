【The Provincial Governor Shows Deference】
When about two hundred mounted warriors were seated in rows in the courtyard, the high court noble declared: "Prince Taira arrived in this province yesterday, yet the provincial governor has still not come to pay his respects. Give your imperial response as to whether punitive action should be taken or not." The provincial governor appeared troubled and anxious, but when a certain lay priest who served as his administrator gave him a meaningful look, the governor understood his intention and respectfully acknowledged, answering that he would consult with his clan members and come to pay his respects without delay. Thereupon, the envoy said "How fearsome! There must be no negligent behavior," and departed with dignity, elbows held high, leading his retinue away.

【Hidesato Listens to the Story of the Woman Who Was the Incarnation of a Great Serpent】
"I am one who has dwelt here for many years. Recently, there is an enemy who bears hatred toward me. Would you not slay this foe for my sake?" she earnestly beseeched him. Hidesato readily agreed without inquiring into the details. With this woman as his guide, he returned again to the Seta Bridge, parted the waves of the lake water, and entered into the depths for more than fifty chō. Suddenly he emerged into a world of golden halls and jeweled towers of such splendor as he had never before beheld. After a while, a great king properly attired in court dress welcomed Hidesato and invited him into the guest quarters.

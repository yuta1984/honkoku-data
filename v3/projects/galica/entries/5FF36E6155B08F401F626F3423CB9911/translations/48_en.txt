[Suminari Shot Through the Chest]

A stray arrow from an unknown archer pierced straight through his chest plate. It was a fatal wound, so he fell backwards from his horse, and the imperial army, riding on their victory, charged forward. With their general struck down, how could they possibly hold their ground? They scattered in all directions and fled.

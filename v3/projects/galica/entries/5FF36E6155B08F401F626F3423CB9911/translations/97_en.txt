【The Scenery at Kiyomi-ga-seki】
For the great general of the eastern expedition, Counselor and Right Gate Guard Commander Fujiwara no Tadafumi was appointed, and for the vice-generals, his younger brother Tadamine of the Ministry of Justice and Musashi Governor Minamoto no Tsunemoto were both selected.
Their total force numbered forty-six thousand and more cavalry.
They departed the capital on the second day of the second month,
and arrived at the foothills of Mount Fuji in Suruga Province on the fifteenth day of the same month.
This place is called Kiyomi-ga-seki,
and it is the foremost scenic spot along the highway.
　Military supervisor Kiyohara no Shigetō
　　　　　murmured in verse:
　The fire-light of fishing boats
　Burns coldly upon the waves,
　The sound of bells on the post road
　Passes over mountains in the night

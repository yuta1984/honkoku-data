【Nagasawa Yasutoki Takes Refuge in Tsuchiura Castle】
The brothers Shigemori and Kanetō somehow managed to help their father escape back into the castle, where they tended to him with various medical care. However, because it was such a grave wound, he finally breathed his last. If only they had followed Shigemori's advice in this battle and held up in the castle to await the enemy, they would not have allowed their general to be struck down so uselessly.

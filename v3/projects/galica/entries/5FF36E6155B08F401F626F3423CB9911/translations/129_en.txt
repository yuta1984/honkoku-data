【Gorō Masatame Fighting in Desperate Fury】
Shirō Masahira of Ōashiwara, upon hearing that Masakado had been struck down, committed suicide and died. Gorō Masatame was fighting in desperate fury when he grappled alongside one who called himself Arakawa Yagorō. They fell and wrestled, rolling over and under each other, but Masatame's strength seemed to prevail—he pinned Yagorō beneath him, slit his throat, and was about to stand up.

【Watanabe Tsukau Asking the Reason for the Tears】
Through my stratagem, I shall first cause this castle to fall and then devise further plans. Returning to the castle, under the pretense that there were loyal retainers within, he sent a letter of secret communication to the enemy general Tashi Tsuneakira, saying: "When fire is raised as a signal, please attack. We shall support you from within." From the general down to the common soldiers, all cast away their hat insignia, set fire to the watchtowers, and splitting into groups of five and seven, they escaped toward the capital amidst the confusion. The attacking force of several tens of thousands of horsemen raised battle cries, shouting "Now the signal fire is being lit!" and rushed in, each trying to be first, but the enemy had already fled, leaving only allies fighting amongst themselves.

【Sadamori's Army Sets Fire to Masakado's Palace at Soma】
Masakado's forces gradually declined, with some fleeing and others surrendering, so it seemed that Masakado's fate would not last much longer. When the military position at the beach defended by a man called Bunya Yoshikane was broken through, Sadamori's army rushed in chaotically and set fire to the great imperial palace at Soma that had been so magnificently constructed. Fierce flames swept across heaven and earth, black smoke covered east and west, and the palace halls and towers decorated with gold and silver burst into flames.

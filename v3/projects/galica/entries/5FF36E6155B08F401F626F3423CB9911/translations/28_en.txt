[People Terrified by Strange Apparitions in the Sky]
In the vast sky appeared two creatures of strange form, like water dragons (mizuchi), seeming to be thirty jō in length.
Their breath was like flames, and their cries thundered as if a hundred or thousand bolts of lightning were striking all at once.
The people who witnessed this were chilled to the bone and their souls took flight; there was no one who did not grieve, wondering what manner of portent this might be.
This was indeed a sign that enemies of the court would rise in rebellion—truly a terrifying omen.

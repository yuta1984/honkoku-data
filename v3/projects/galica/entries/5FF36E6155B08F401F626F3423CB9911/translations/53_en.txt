[Taira no Shigemori and Kanetō Fighting Valiantly]

Taira no Sanmi Kanetō came to his father's castle at Tsuchiura and told him of Masakado's rebellious plot. His father Kunika was greatly alarmed and said, "We must subdue him while the matter is still small." He gathered over 1,300 mounted warriors from throughout the province. The eldest son Sadamori was in Kyoto and not present, so he made the second son Shigemori and third son Kanetō joint commanders. They advanced three ri from the castle and set up their battle formation. Shigemori deliberately retreated over fifty chō and concealed his troops, lying in wait. Mikuriya Saburō Masa[yori]

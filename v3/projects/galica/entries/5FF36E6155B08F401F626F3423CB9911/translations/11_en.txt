When we trace the origins of the Minamoto clan, Prince Sadazumi, the sixth son of Emperor Seiwa (the 56th sovereign), Minister of the Bureau of Central Affairs, resided at the Momozona Palace in Ichijo-Omiya. His son, Prince Tsunemoto, was called Rokuson'o (Six-Generation Prince) because he was the grandson of the sixth imperial prince. On the fifth day of the tenth month of Engi 7 (907 CE), at the age of fifteen, he underwent his coming-of-age ceremony and was appointed to the position of Uma-no-suke (Assistant Director of the Right Imperial Stables) and granted the court rank of Senior Sixth Rank Upper Grade. At this time, he was first granted the surname Minamoto and was bestowed a white banner and a precious sword decorated with mother-of-pearl inlay, being told he would become "the great general of Japan and the leader of all warriors."

【The Interrogation of the Peasant Woman】

Twenty or thirty men surrounded and captured them alive. They brought out the woman and questioned her about the circumstances, and she told them the true story. "Just as we thought," they said, and the two men's heads were cut off before the general. The woman, being found innocent, was released and sent home.

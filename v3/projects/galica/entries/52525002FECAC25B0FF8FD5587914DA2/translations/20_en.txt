"Rest yourself. I'll have you meet her shortly." When she says this, Otose replies "Yes, yes" and goes to the room on the other side. Asaka looks up at Yoshimitsu's face with a smile: "With that child around, I cannot be careless during the day. Please do stay today. In the evening, whether you kill me or let me live, please do as you wish." As she kneels, Yoshimitsu also rises with a reluctant expression.

Asaka calls the maid and has the folding screen moved aside, the bedding folded up, and the rain shutters opened, instantly transforming the space to its daytime appearance. She offers water for rinsing and washing, then brings out the breakfast meal that had been prepared, rewarmed. The daughter Otose, just right for serving the meal, gracefully completes her role and makes her formal greeting. As Yoshimitsu gazes intently at her, he sees elegance surpassing what he had heard. The refinement and beauty of her form make even butterflies dancing in search of flowers and crabapple blossoms heavy with dew seem as nothing. Yoshimitsu becomes somewhat entranced and unknowingly drops the chopsticks he was holding with a clatter onto the tray, his face reddening slightly at the thought that others might notice.

Fair-skinned with beautiful eyebrows, clear eyes and a straight nose, soft vermillion lips - figures like Ariwara no Narihira or Prince Genji he had only seen in storybooks. Such an elegant and refined gentleman, there could not be another like him in this world. Otose too becomes entranced and blushes, her heart beating a little faster. Steadying herself and looking down, she resembles a princess lily blooming by the hedge, heavy with dew.

She poured her heart's passion into the evening mist, glancing at the men's faces with sidelong looks, singing the lyrics of "Once, twice, thrice the traveling hat" with a beautiful voice and delicate gestures - such an exquisite performance that it moved Yoshimitsu and his retainers, indeed everyone present, to deep emotion.

Yoshimitsu opened his fan and praised her enthusiastically with "Bravo! Bravo!" saying "Both in beauty and artistry, she is a maiden without equal." So overwhelmed by love's torment, he thought to take her back to his mansion immediately and keep her by his side for his pleasure. His heart was so distracted and his spirits so urgent, yet due to the heavy rain, his escort had not arrived. So he plotted to spend the night in this house and form a bond with the maiden. But reconsidering - while the girl was already promised as a personal attendant, which posed no problem - he had already made advances toward her mother Asaka, who also seemed to harbor feelings for him. If he were to sleep in this house tonight, it would be difficult to possess Otose. What should he do? He pondered this.

Here he devised a stratagem, calling Saguri and whispering in his ear: "Arrange things thus and so." Saguri nodded and replied, "I shall accomplish it successfully."

Therefore Yoshimitsu awaited nightfall. Soon the sake and delicacies that Asaka had ordered were ready and brought before them. High and low made merry together, drinking and feasting until the evening twilight hours.

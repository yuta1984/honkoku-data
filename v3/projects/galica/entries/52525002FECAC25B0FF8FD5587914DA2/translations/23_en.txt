At this time, Yoshimitsu rose from his seat saying he was going to the privy, and Otose followed behind him, carrying a water bucket and hand towel in both hands. As it happened, there was no one else around. Yoshimitsu turned and said, "Oh, Otose! Thank you for your trouble. Well, put those things down - I have something to discuss with you. Come here," and took her hand to draw her near. Being an innocent maiden, her heart beat rapidly and her face flushed red. When Yoshimitsu pulled her close and pressed face to face, the fragrance of aloe oil, face powder, and musk was enchanting, and he too felt a thrill through his body. Without words, mouth met mouth. Otose had recently been taught the ways of love by Michitaru, so she was no longer completely naive. Fearfully but willingly, she extended just the tip of her tongue about an inch, which Yoshimitsu sucked eagerly, but still not satisfied, he gripped her collar tightly and entwined his tongue forcefully with hers. With such intensity he sucked her tongue to its very root, continuing to draw upon it, until Otose became flushed, her ears and cheeks turning bright red, and she yielded completely. Yoshimitsu, finding her even more adorable, tightened his grip on her collar and extended his left hand, lifting her garments and slowly inserting his fingers. She was still a fourteen-year-old maiden, with just a little soft hair above her feminine parts that barely touched his fingertips, and the soft edges were like two steamed buns pressed together.

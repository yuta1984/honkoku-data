She trembled even more violently, her teeth chattering uncontrollably. Yoshimitsu too swallowed his voice, utterly shamefaced. After a while, in any case, to emerge as things were would be too shameful. Fortunately, the rain cleared and the moonlight through the clouds became dim. Though they were women, the two of them decided to escape from this place for now. He whispered to Otose and took her hand, pushed open the garden gate, stepped outside, and ran gasping for seven or eight blocks. Once again clouds covered the sky, and the rain began falling heavily. Having no umbrella, they were soaked from head to toe, which was not only inconvenient, but the surroundings became dark and their footing uncertain. Otose became increasingly frightened and confused, simply leaning against Yoshimitsu, firmly grasping her obi knot, her whole body trembling continuously. Seeing this, Yoshimitsu felt even more wretched, and looking around desperately, he spotted a light nearby. Approaching what might be a house, he found a grass hut with a sagging roof - it was a Jizo hall he had known from before. Taking shelter there for a while, he stirred up the remaining lamp flame before the Buddha and wrung out their wet clothes. Otose removed her outer kosode garment and wiped clean his wet and soiled feet, then wiped her own feet as well. Looking at each other's faces, together they heaved deep sighs.

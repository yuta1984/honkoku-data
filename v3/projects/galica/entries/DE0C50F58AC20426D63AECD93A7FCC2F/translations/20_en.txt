came here. If Your Majesty has the intention to try my medical art, I can immediately remove Your Majesty's serious illness without using internal medicines or external applications." The king was pleased and requested treatment. Douban returned to his private residence and made a racquet board (something like a battledore used for hitting balls in games), carved a hollow in its handle, and filled it with medicinal agents. The next day, he brought it to the palace, prostrated himself before the king, and kissed the ground (kissing the ground is a form of respect in this region). He requested that the king come to the racquet court, had the king hold the racquet he had made the previous night, showed him in detail how to hold it, and had him compete with the courtiers on horseback, hitting balls and contesting victory and defeat.

They departed from the island kingdom, and the long journey proceeded without obstacles. Several days before they were to approach the capital, they sent messengers ahead to report their return and explain the reasons for the delay. The ministers and all the subjects of the entire capital came out in great numbers to welcome them. The ministers first reported on the peace throughout the country, and the citizens celebrated the Emperor's safe return. For several days, the sounds of rejoicing and singing filled everywhere from the imperial city to the villages (both the capital and the countryside). The next day, the Emperor gathered all the court officials and explained in detail everything that had happened, ordering that the Black Island King be adopted as his heir. The young king remained in the imperial palace, while ministers were dispatched to govern the Black Island Kingdom, and rewards were given to the officials and subjects who had served faithfully.

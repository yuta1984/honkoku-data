It is about five ri into the interior. In these mountains there is what is called a "wind cave" that constantly generates wind. The height of the cave is over two jō, the width is over two jō, and in wide places it reaches three or four jō. After going about one chō, such cave passages split into dozens of branches above, below, left and right, and each single path alone branches into hundreds more. After going about one and a half chō further, the passages split beyond counting like a spider's web, causing one to lose direction and making progress difficult. The depths are completely impossible to explore fully. According to what the local people tell, after going one ri there is a great river that flows horizontally, and by crossing it one can reach Ise Province, though whether this is true or not is unknown.

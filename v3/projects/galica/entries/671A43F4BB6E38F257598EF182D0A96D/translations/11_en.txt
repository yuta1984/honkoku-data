It is unknown. Inside this cave, front and back, left and right, above and below, without even an inch of empty space, everything is stalactite formations. Those hanging down from above are like icicles, with thickness of one arm's embrace, and length of one ken or two ken, or one jō or two jō, some reaching down to form round pillars. Those gently spreading to both sides are like waves, like waterfalls, or resembling the heads and backs of cattle and horses, or like the halo of Fudō Myōō. Their forms are impossible to describe fully in words. Though it is said that such places exist in many locations, most likely none of the large ones can match this place.

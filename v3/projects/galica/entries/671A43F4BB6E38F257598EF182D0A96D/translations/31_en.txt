The one at that house is about the size of a pillow, with the shape of a mallet bag clearly visible. There is a small shrine behind the house where it is enshrined. It is said to have been found in the nearby mountains. There is also one at Shinkō-ji Temple in Koseki, Ōtsu in Ōmi Province, about seven to eight sun in height, kept on a household Shinto altar. The place of origin is not detailed. It is a large stone in the mountains near Fude-suteyama, east of the Sakano-shita post station on the Tōkaidō. It can be seen from the highway.

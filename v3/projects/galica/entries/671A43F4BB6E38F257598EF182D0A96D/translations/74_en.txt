I hope they will search and seek them out.

Divine Age Stone Fifteen

Mr. Fukuoka of a certain residence in Hyakumanben, Kyoto, from spring to this autumn of An'ei 9, year of the Metal Rat (1780), traveled through the northern and eastern provinces seeking rare stones throughout the realm. Upon reaching Echigo Province, he lodged at the home of a man called Shinanoya Tōzaemon in Wakino Village, Mishima District, and talked about rare stones all night long. The host possessed unusually shaped divine stones, so Fukuoka requested to see them. Their origin was said to be from excavations in the mountains at a place called Hagino Castle in the same district of the same province. Mr. Fukuoka presented this to me, saying he had made detailed sketches of their forms.

Mojiseki Stone (Inscribed Characters Stone) - Item 11

This stone is found on the seabed twenty chō offshore from Kuri-no-misaki in Tosa Province. It is considered the finest quality inkstone material in Japan. It is called Mojiseki Stone, and is also known as Tosa Blue Stone or Island Inkstone. Its color is blue-black with red veins. Every year on March 3rd, during the great low tide, the water recedes more than two chō. Following an ancient custom, many monks from the local Nishi-dera temple come out and stand on the seashore, chanting sutras. While the sutra recitation continues, they rush out to the offshore area and collect the stones from the sand of the tidal flats.

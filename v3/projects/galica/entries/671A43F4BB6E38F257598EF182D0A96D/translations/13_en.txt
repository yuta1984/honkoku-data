One shaku and two sun. All have the form of Buddha. Therefore they are called Buddha stones. Also, at the border between Ōshū and Dewa provinces, there are Arhat stones. These too naturally take the form of monks, some single figures, some in pairs. The priest Keishū of Rinsen Temple in Saga, western Kyoto, kindly bestowed upon me a Kannon stone. Though it truly appears as if carved by hand, it is certainly a natural product. Its height is five sun and three bu. It is a standing image of Kannon. He presented it with an accompanying verse. Also, on the day I was drafting this book, by chance an old monk came and sat beside my desk, saying "I am a wandering monk from Seishū province. You have loved and been familiar with precious stones since your youth."

Buddha Image Stone - Entry 14

At the base of Mount Fuji, in the valley of Ōmiya, there is a large stone. On the stone's surface, a Buddha image appears in relief. Its length is two sun and five bu. It is entirely not man-made but a natural creation. Also, in Hōshi District of Noto Province, in Bosatsu Valley, there is something called a Bodhisattva Stone. It is one sun in length, yellow in color, and resembles a human form, though the facial features are not clearly defined. It merely has the shape of a Buddhist monk. The Bodhisattva Stone mentioned in botanical texts is of the same name but a different type. Also, in Higo Province, at Juhōji Temple in Kawaguchi Village of Mount Aso, this object exists. Its length is one shaku.

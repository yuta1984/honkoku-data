I obtained this at a place called Eganokuruma in the fourth month of An'ei 2 (1773).
The shape is no different from a plane held by carpenters, and the size is likewise the same. The color is blackish-red and lustrous like a jewel, making it an extremely rare and beautiful object. Later, I also obtained one from a place called Kō in the same province. This too is the same type of object.
The color is yellowish-red and gleaming like a jewel. In both places, the local people call them "fox planes." Upon consideration, they are likely ancient objects from the age of gods. I have not heard of them existing elsewhere, nor have I heard of other collectors of similar interests possessing them.

Found by excavating in the mountains of Ganokuruma in Noto Province. Color is blackish-red with luster.

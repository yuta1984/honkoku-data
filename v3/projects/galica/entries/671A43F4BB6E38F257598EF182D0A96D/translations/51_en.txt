　　　Unkonshi, Volume Three, Part Four

　Magatama (Curved Jewels)　One

Although this was previously included in the latter volume, I record further observations here. In Tanigawabe Village in Hachiya, Mino Province, there is a physician. He claims to have collected items from the local mountains and possesses several varieties including magatama and shinkanseki (sacred tube stones) in his collection. In the autumn of the first year of An'ei era, an ancient jar was excavated at a place called Tokonabe in Chita District, Owari Province. Inside the jar were more than two hundred magatama. All were small and of inferior quality.

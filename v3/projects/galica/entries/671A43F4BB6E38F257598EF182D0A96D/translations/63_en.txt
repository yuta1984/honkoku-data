The shape resembles a bamboo tube. Height: two sun, circumference: five sun around. The entire piece is made of blue agate and is of the highest quality. It is said to have been found at Mount Shigi in Yamato Province. Though it has feet, it stands upright. This is not craftsmanship that today's jade workers can achieve. However, it is a carved object, a divine artifact from ancient times, created by the gods.

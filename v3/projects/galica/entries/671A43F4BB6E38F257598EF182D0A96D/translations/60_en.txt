measures one inch, or a little over one inch. On top, three ridges are carved high, and there is one hole each on the top and bottom. These are rarely excavated from ancient grounds of shrines in various places in Yamashiro Province. I have not yet heard of them being found in other provinces. However, there should be some evidence that they do not exist [elsewhere]. Fugen-in in Yamashiro Province, similarly Fujimondo Shūsai, Mr. Tanigawa of Ise Province, and Kenkadō of Naniwa all possess these items. It is said that all are products of Yamashiro Province. What I possess is also a product of Mount Miwa in Yamashiro Province. According to the research of Mr. Tanigawa of Ise Province, these are the heads of swords from the age of gods and are called stone sword heads.

All are chestnut-colored as shown in the illustration. Obtained at Miwa in Yamashiro Province

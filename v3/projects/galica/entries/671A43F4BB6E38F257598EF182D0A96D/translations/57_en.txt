Divine Age Stone 3
Mr. Kishida of the capital obtained this from the common people of Mount Iwakura in western Rakuyō, and kindly gave me this divine stone from ancient times. It is tea-colored, seven sun in length, about one handful in thickness with a slight bend, and has two flanges in the middle. It is extremely hard, ancient, and loveable. It is the same type and same material as the one kindly given from Sōshū in Hida Province described in the latter part, differing only in color. Therefore, I treasure this all the more. Mr. Kishida of the capital is a friend in my stone hobby.

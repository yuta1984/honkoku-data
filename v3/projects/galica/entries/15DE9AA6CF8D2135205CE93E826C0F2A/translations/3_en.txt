Quoted from "Courtesans of Nagasaki Dejima" by Shiraishi Hiroko:
"The artist is undoubtedly Ishizaki Yūshi. The characters written like a ship's name on the stern - 'USI' represents 'Yūshi' and 'GESCHILDERT' is Dutch meaning 'painted' or 'depicted,' which can be read as 'painted by Yūshi.' Ishizaki Yūshi (Meiwa 5 - Kōka 3 [1768-1846]) was a painter from Nagasaki. As a Tang painting appraiser, he established a realistic Western-style painting that combined Chinese and Western painting styles."

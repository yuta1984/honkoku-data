A horse painted in a picture comes out and eats grass mochi,
a deer painted in a picture comes out and eats ohagi—
this is indeed a foolish parable, but when it comes to
mastering such artistic excellence, it is beyond the understanding
of amateurs, and those mochi would naturally be from a mochi shop.
Here, the spirit resonance and structural method in the paintings of Tōō (Hokusai)
achieve such truth in depiction that there is a deliciousness like eating mochi with syrup,
and in the precision of forms depicting all manner of things...

The above is a partial excerpt from the preface of "Hokusai Manga Volume 6" by Katsushika Hokusai,
published in Bunka 14 (1817) by the Edo publisher Kadomaruya, with the author being Shokusanjin Bunpōdō.
This book "Bankan-zu" is said to have been painted by the Nagasaki artist Ishizaki Yūshi in Kansei 9 (1797) just before Gijsbert Hemmy's death, so there is a twenty-year time gap with this preface. Parts of the preface from "Hokusai Manga" also appear on the following pages of pictorial explanations.
The connection between Gijsbert Hemmy and Hokusai occurred in Kansei 10, when Hemmy met Hokusai at Edo Nagasakiya during his journey from Nagasaki Dejima to Edo for the court visit, and commissioned two volumes of paintings. At that time Hokusai was 39 years old. Since Hemmy was a Hokusai enthusiast during his lifetime, it is thought that someone later inserted this into "Bankan-zu," but the relationship between this book's illustrations and the preface is unclear.

Master Taito had a passion for painting from the beginning, devoting himself solely to eating and painting, and eventually established a distinctive style within the Katsushika school, gaining great fame throughout the world.
At this point, many students entered his school to learn his techniques. The master taught these disciples, saying: "Painting has no teacher. If you simply strive to depict truth, you will naturally acquire skill." His pupils were troubled by this. A certain person, hearing the master's words, remonstrated with him, saying: "You are the founder of the Katsushika school. Your disciples who admire your style wish to master this very style. Why then do you tell them to seek other teachers? Even Li Lou's exceptional eyesight and Gongshu Zi's skillful craftsmanship cannot create perfect squares and circles without using rules and compasses."

Jingyang Ridge

Thinking of his hometown and bidding farewell to Lord Chai Jin, at a tavern on the border of Yanggu County, he boasted and drank his fill of strong liquor called "Bu Guo Gang" (Don't Cross the Ridge), and with unsteady steps reached the middle of Jingyang Ridge. Though the sky had passed the hour of the Monkey but had not yet reached the hour of the Rooster, his vision flickered. He gently flicked his eyelashes with his finger, and when he steadied his drunkenness and looked intently, he saw a warning notice that there was a tiger on this ridge that injured people. Without finishing reading it, he laughed derisively, and fearing it no more than wasps or bees, he climbed up. A strange wind came blowing down from the peak. Pushing through the forest where day had completely ended, a tiger came out roaring.

The great tiger - he caught it! With a great shout, he spread his arms wide, grabbed both ears, and kicked it down with his right foot. The tiger fell against the rocks, and its roaring voice was exactly like falling thunder. Wu Song breathed on his fists and continued to strike sixty or seventy times. Beaten down by such extraordinary superhuman strength, even this fierce beast, alas, had its breath cut off and voice silenced.

《Marginal note: Among the seventy-two stars of Disha, the Dicha Star》Blue-Eyed Tiger Li Yun

This man is a capital head (police chief) of Yishui County. Because of his exceptional skill in tracking down bandits in mountain caves and wilderness holes, he is nicknamed Blue-Eyed Tiger. At the foot of Yi Ridge in his hometown, upon hearing the complaint of Taigong Cao's daughter, he immediately took up his staff and rope, commanded his officers, and ordered the capture of Black Whirlwind (Li Kui) as the villain who had killed Li Gui, the son-in-law of the Cao family. Spitting on his hands, he bound him within three inches of rope and was transporting him in a prison cart when he was deceived by the narcotic wine offered as hospitality by the Zhu Gui brothers, lost Li Kui, and had more than half his soldiers cut down and scattered. Though he had rank, it was hard to sustain; though he had a master, it was hard to serve. At this time when his honor had nowhere to turn, he was entangled by Zhu Fu's clever tongue and finally joined the water stronghold's camp, escaping the troubles of the Gai family.

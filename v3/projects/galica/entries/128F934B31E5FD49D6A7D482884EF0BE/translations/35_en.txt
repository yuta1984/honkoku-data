《Marginal note: Disha Star among the seventy-two members of the Earthly Fiend Stars》　Suppressor of Three Mountains Huang Xin

This person was the commandant of Qingzhou Prefecture. He studied under Qin Ming's tutelage and his martial arts were exceptionally excellent.
He skillfully wielded the Mourning Gate Sword, and when iron or stone touched it, there was never a time when it would not cut through. His body was
tall and large like a dragon. In his daily arrogance he would say, "I swear I will pacify the three mountains of Qingzhou" 《Marginal note: The three mountains are Peach Blossom Mountain》
《Marginal note: Two Dragon Mountain and Clear Breeze Mountain》, and because the villagers heard these words, they nicknamed him "Suppressor of Three Mountains."
At that time, an incident occurred at Clear Breeze Stockade, and following the private intentions of the Civil Commandant Liu Gao, he received orders from the prefectural governor and went to the stockade to secretly plot. He captured Song Gongming and Hua Rong, put them in prison carts, and while heading toward Qingzhou Prefecture, he lost the two prison carts and retreated to the stockade again. However, he yielded to the persuasive words of his master Qin Ming, abandoned evil ways and finally turned to righteousness, achieving high fame and shining brightly in the stellar realm of Liangshan.

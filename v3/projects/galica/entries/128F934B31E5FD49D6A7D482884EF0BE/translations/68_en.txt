In the army against the Liao Kingdom, they searched for Lu Junyi at Qingshi Valley, wandering through the valley bottom all day long, but there was no way in or out and the day had completely ended.

In the army at Hangzhou Castle, they seized grain ships at Fan Village and furthermore set fire to the castle. This was their greatest achievement. Although they were such heroes, pitiably both brothers together lost their lives to crossbow stones at the back mountain of Wulong Ridge. Alas, what a pity!

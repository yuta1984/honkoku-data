General Shi, Shi Yong
His firmness in forming battle formations is like a foundation stone. His crushing of enemy soldiers in battle resembles a stone mill. Taking the name of a hero and transmitting it through all ages is exactly like a stone monument. Because his heart is wise and his body is solid, the "stones" in his name are naturally fitting.

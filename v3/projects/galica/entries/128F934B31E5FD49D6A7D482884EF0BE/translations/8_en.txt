Feiyun Ferry

Wu Song was sentenced to exile again, and on the road to Mengzhou, he sensed the suspicious glances exchanged by the lower officials. At Feiyun Ferry, above and below the bridge, he killed four men. Having learned the identity of his enemies, he turned back and spilled blood at Yuanyang Tower. Acting alone as a single man - truly he can be called a hero.

《Interlinear note: Among the thirty-six members of the Heavenly Spirits, the Heavenly Chief Star》 Timely Rain Song Jiang

This man was a clerk (押司) of Yuncheng County, and his family had lived in Song Family Village for three generations. In sleeping, eating, and daily activities, he never abandoned the virtues of benevolence, trust, propriety, and righteousness—this was as natural as voice and echo. When there were impoverished people in the village, he would help them with his wealth; when there were men in crisis in the country, he would risk his life to save them. For this reason, people throughout Shandong and Hebei called him "Timely Rain" in praise. By what evil karma did he take Yan Po Xi as his concubine, leading to the dispute over the letter pouch? Though he was a benevolent man who would not kill even a single ant crawling at his feet, he had no way to pacify the wicked woman's behavior. In anger he killed his concubine in the tower, and in tears he cut down soldiers at the post station. Though he had experienced hundreds of battlefields, he had stained his sword with blood by his own hand only these two times in his entire life. When he sought refuge at Clear Wind Mountain to escape official pursuit, he saved Liu Gao's wife, but the adulteress repaid kindness with enmity, and he was captured beneath the lanterns of the Lantern Festival. Why did even the millions of lights fail to illuminate his crime? Though he received rescue from Hua Rong and others on the prisoner's road, there was no way to remove his father's calamity, and he finally became an exile in Jiangzhou.

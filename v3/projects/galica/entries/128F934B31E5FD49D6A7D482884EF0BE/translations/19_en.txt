《Among the thirty-six members of the Celestial Stars: Celestial Minute Star》Nine Dragons Shi Jin

This person is the legitimate son of Liu Taigong from Shi Family Village in Huayin County. Based on the tattoos on his body, people nicknamed him Nine Dragons. Initially, he learned staff and spear techniques from Li Zhong, a medicine peddler, and later received instruction in the eighteen martial arts from Wang Jin, a traveling guest, thus perfecting his physical strength and skills. While enjoying the cool breeze, he overheard talk of bandits on Mount Xiaohua, cooperated with the villagers to capture the bandit chief Chen Da, and threatened Zhu Wu and Yang Chun. However, he later reconciled with the three bandits, forming a relationship as close as water and fish. To resolve the county magistrate's resentment, he once fled to the mountain stronghold of Xiaohua, and while traveling again toward Yanzhou Prefecture, he met Lu Da and held a sworn brotherhood feast. After wandering south and north, he later formed a heroic band at Liangshan Marsh, became Song Gongming's right-hand man, crushed Gao Qiu's arrogant army, submitted together to the Emperor, and when heading to Sucheng in the Liao Kingdom, cut Ming Yu and Ming Ji into four pieces with a single stroke. At Runzhou under Fang La, he slew the fierce general Shen Gang - truly a hero whom ten thousand men could not match.

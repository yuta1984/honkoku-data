He invited the Flower Monk to ascend to a wine tower, where they took cups and discussed martial arts, and the pleasure of talking about military strategy surpassed even the music of strings and pipes under the moon and flowers by tenfold. But this was not a shark but a white-scabbarded conspiracy sword bought in the streets, and he was captured at the White Tiger Hall and exiled to Cangzhou. On the way, in the danger of Wild Boar Forest, he received help from Zhishen's staff, and at Chai Jin's hospitality, he bit the bones of Instructor Hong. Lu Yuhou's malicious intent did not reach the place of exile - was it the spirit of the Mountain God Temple? The night snow of the fodder depot was dyed crimson red with fierce fire and fresh blood. The evil plot suddenly went awry, and the three villains were instead killed in rage by Leopard Head. Near a thatched hut pressed by freezing suffering, he unexpectedly met Chai Jin again, escaped from danger and ascended Mount Liang, obtaining Yang Zhi through the certificate of allegiance. When welcoming Chao Gai, Wu Yong and others, he killed Wang Lun to establish a leader. Beginning with Hu Sanniang, capturing the strong alive and breaking through the fortified - his achievements are too numerous to count.

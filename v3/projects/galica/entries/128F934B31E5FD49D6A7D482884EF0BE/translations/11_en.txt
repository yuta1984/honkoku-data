Timely Rain Song Jiang's Fame

His righteousness is higher than the highest heavens, his benevolence thicker than the great earth. Yet when he keeps a concubine for himself, she transforms into a venomous serpent within his letter pouch; when he helps another man's wife, she becomes an evil snake before the flower lantern. Though drunk he brews disaster with seditious poetry, in his dreams descends a heavenly scroll as divine gift.

Though cut, it cannot be broken; though burned, it cannot be destroyed. How wondrous is this man!

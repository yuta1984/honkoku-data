Among the seventy-two members of the Earthly Fiends, the Earth Music Star: Iron Caller Yue He

This man was originally from Maozhou and came to Dengzhou Castle to serve in the position of jailer. He gave his daughter in marriage to Sun Li, known as "Sickly Lieutenant Chi." Though he mastered the eighteen martial arts, he did not use force to intimidate others. Being benevolent, he showed compassion to many criminals and prisoners, caring for them as if they were his own disciples. Once, following the request of Gu Dasao and others, he rescued Jie Zhen and Jie Bao from their prison suffering, and together with eight other heroes, joined Song Jiang's forces. After experiencing military affairs for some time and defeating Gao Qiu's imperial troops, he was taken to Tokyo (Kaifeng) for negotiations. When months passed without being returned to the water marsh, Dai Zong and Yan Qing conspired to help him escape from Gao Qiu's mansion. Later, on the day when peace was established throughout the realm, because this man had mastered the art of singing, he was invited by Prince Consort Wang Taiwei and obtained an official salary. This was due to his nickname "Iron Caller."

《Among the seventy-two members of the Earthly Fiend Stars: Earthly Cycle Star》Jumping Stream Tiger Chen Da

This person was from Ye City. He was skilled with spear and staff, and possessed acrobatic arts, able to jump across wide spaces and leap over high places. In the past, when he was young, west of Ye City there was a deep ravine of twin streams about a hundred feet across, which he leaped over in a single bound after wagering fifty taels of silver. The common people were moved and amazed by this, and nicknamed him Jumping Stream Tiger. Together with Zhu Wu and Yang Chun, he became a bandit chief on Mount Shaohua, wielding power for six or seven years. He fought with Shi Jin in the village at the foot of the mountain, but achieved reconciliation through Zhu Wu's mediation. As autumn departed and spring came, while honing his skills as a hero, trouble began to entangle from a small matter involving the painter Wang Yi, bringing disaster to Shi Jin and Zhishen, leading to continued battles with swords and halberds at the temples of West Mountain and the castle of Huazhou. Joining in this military campaign, he performed outstandingly. Deeply impressed by the great reliability of Song Jiang and Wu Yong, he wholeheartedly devoted himself and submitted to the water stronghold (Liangshan Marsh).

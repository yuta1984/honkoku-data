He became an exile. In his drunkenness, he composed a rebellious poem and was reported by Huang Wenbing. The matter resulted in a death sentence, and his body was about to be thrown under the executioner's blade. At that moment, Chao Gai, Wu Yong and others rushed to rescue him completely and successfully, and he was invited to Liangshan Marsh. When the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King (Chao Gai) died midway, finally the 108 men submitted to benevolence, inclined toward righteousness, and bowed to revere him as the mountain chief. In the second year of Xuanhe, a heavenly stele descended, and it was revealed through a Taoist's recitation that the 108 men of Liangshan Marsh were stars of the Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends. Through Grand Marshal Su's memorial, he became a complete minister of the Son of Heaven. Beginning with the Liao bandits, he conquered Hebei, Huaixi, and Jiangnan over five years and seven months, pacified the country and brought peace to the people. He played victory songs and was enfeoffed as Military Virtue Grand Master and Pacification Commissioner of Chuzhou. However, when he fell to the wine of the Four Poison Officials and was about to return to heaven, secretly fearing future disgrace, he summoned Li Kui to drink poisoned wine. They were buried together at Liao'er Hollow outside the south gate of Chuzhou City and were posthumously titled "Loyal, Heroic, Righteous, Beneficial, and Spiritually Responsive Marquis."

《Marginal note: Among the thirty-six members of the Tiangang stars, the Tianhu star》Flowery Monk Lu Zhishen

This individual was a military commissioner of the Strategic Command. His surname was Lu, given name Da, and his character was thoroughly honest. He loved drinking like a great whale consuming a hundred rivers. After eloping, he entrusted himself to Member of the Gentry Zhao, and became a monk at Mount Wutai, taking the dharma name Zhishen. Because he had flower tattoos on his back, some praised him by calling him the Flowery Monk. Having taken the form of an itinerant monk with staff and bowl, when he was tending the vegetable garden at the Great Xiangguo Temple in the Eastern Capital, he uprooted a large willow tree and amazed the Leopard Head. Again traveling through various provinces, he formed a sworn brotherhood with the Nine-Dragoned, and became a bandit chief at Baozhu Temple on Two-Dragon Mountain for two years. Finally becoming a subject of the emperor, when confronting the campaign against four rebel groups, in conquering the prefectures and counties of Tianhu in Hebei, he killed the Regional Governor and Privy Councilor Niu Wenzhong at Yizhou city.

　　Sick Pass Suo (Yang Xiong)
His wife committed adultery and
gave her heart to another man's
husband - how could he as her husband
not be angry? Moreover, she damaged his courage
and harmed his righteousness -
the wicked and crafty Qiao Yun. How satisfying it was
to kill that evil wife
in front of the mountain god's shrine.
Hiding her corpse
deep in Cuiping Mountain
was not for the sake of
his wife, but for
　her husband Yang Xiong's own
　　　sake.

　　Life-Sacrificing Third Son Shi Xiu
From Yang Xiong's mistaken drunken words, he was
deceived by Qiao Yun's wicked tongue, and to clear away
the suspicion that fell upon
Shi Xiu, one
dawn, at Yang Xiong's back gate, watching and
waiting for suspicious
persons to emerge, at just that moment
a monk came out from
inside. "You are suspicious!" he
captured him, and under torture
heard him confess
everything truthfully, then killed him on the spot, wrapping the monk's
direct robe around his own body. At the sound of the wooden fish
struck as a signal, wondering if anyone else was watching, Pei Ruhai
crept out, but under the sword
the sacred water flowed lewdly, becoming a stream of blood -
　this was the excellence of Shi Xiu's blade.

《Interlinear note: Tiangang Star, one of the thirty-six members, Tianyi Star》Red-Haired Ghost Liu Tang

This individual was from Donglu Prefecture. His entire body was dark, his face broad, and he had a cinnabar mark (red birthmark) near his temples. Therefore, people nicknamed him "Red-Haired Ghost." When he came to Dongxi Village to report about the ten thousand strings of cash being transported from Beijing, he found that night had already fallen. Unable to enter Chao Gai's gate, he slept deeply in the Lingguan Temple and was captured by the patrolling Lei Heng. Through Chao the Heavenly King's clever scheme, he posed as a false nephew and was freed from his bonds, but unable to contain his anger, he gave chase and fought fiercely in the thick forest. When Lei Heng was almost in grave danger, he was calmed by Wu Yong and Chao Gai, and they returned together to devise strategies. With high expectations at Yellow Clay Ridge and having become a leader at Liangshan Marsh, he first stained over a thousand soldiers with blood in his initial battle, captured General Huang An, and when facing the linked cavalry, took alive Deputy General Han Tao. Among all his deeds, burning Gao Qiu's ships was an outstanding great achievement.

The Divine Physician An Daoquan
He practiced medicine in the Song dynasty and possessed skills that rivaled those of Bian Que and Hua Tuo, but was troubled by Qiao Nu's leg ailment that hindered her walking, and obtained medicine from Zhang Shun's sword tip. Ah, what marvelous arts these are - that there are medicines beyond the hundred medicines! What is truly regrettable, however, is that the characters written in blood on the wall of the courtesan's house to record sins cannot be reached by the tongue of the licking physician.

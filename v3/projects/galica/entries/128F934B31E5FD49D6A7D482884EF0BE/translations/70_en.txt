《Marginal note: Among the thirty-six members of the Tiangang Stars, the Tianlao Star》　Sick Pass Suo Yang Xiong
This person was from Henan. He was accomplished in martial arts and versed in literature. Because his complexion was entirely yellow, he was mockingly given the nickname "Sick Guan Suo." On the day he was transferred to become a clerk in Suzhou City, when the scoundrel Zhang Bao and his gang obstructed him in the street, Shi Xiu, a firewood merchant, could not bear to watch this and blocked the villains, striking them down. Admiring this righteous courage, Yang Xiong made a pact with him to become sworn brothers, sharing meals and lodging together. However, his wife Pan Qiao Yun committed adultery, and while drunk, he believed her lies told in the bedroom and was about to break his sworn brotherhood. But when he saw Pei Ruhai's corpse, the confusion in his heart immediately cleared. Barely restraining his anger at that moment, he deceived his wife Qiao Yun by saying they would visit their ancestors' graves, brought her to Cuiping Mountain, tied her to the base of a large tree, pulled out her tongue, gouged out her eyes, enumerated his grievances, and killed her. To avoid official pursuit, he joined the group at Liangshan Marsh. Normally he formed units with Shi Xiu, demonstrating martial prowess in capturing Yang Wen and Ga Chongbao, with exploits in battle after battle too numerous to count.

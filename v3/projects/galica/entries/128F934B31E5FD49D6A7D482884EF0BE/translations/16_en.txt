《Interlinear note: Among the seventy-two members of the Earthly Fiend Stars, the Earth Spirit Star》Divine Physician An Daoquan

This one person was originally from Jiankang Prefecture. He practiced medicine as a family profession, and when encountering sick people, he would tilt his head to examine them. When preparing medicines, there was not a single case of the forty-four internal diseases (abdominal ailments) or the eighty-eight external swellings (tumors) that he could not cure. His achievement in quickly curing Zhang Shun's mother's abscess in previous years was praised, and this time when Song Jiang was troubled by a strange tumor, Zhang Shun again rushed to the prefecture to invite him. On the evening he arrived at the house, seeing that he was deeply attached to his beloved courtesan Li Qiaonu and that the pain of separation seemed extremely distressing, thinking this would likely hinder his departure, after Qiaonu came to the farewell banquet, Zhang Shun (nicknamed "White Stripe in the Waves") wielded his white blade and killed her without making a sound in the water, instead staining the wall with fresh blood. Since it was recorded that Daouan was the owner of the blade that killed Qiaonu, finding it difficult to remain peacefully in his hometown, he resolved to flee to the water stronghold. Then, examining Song Jiang's illness, he laughingly applied medicine, and in less than ten days achieved complete recovery, with his condition and appetite returning to normal. The medicinal abilities of this world are not inferior to any.

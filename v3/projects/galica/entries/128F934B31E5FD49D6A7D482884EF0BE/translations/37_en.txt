《Marginal note: Among the thirty-six stars of Tiangang, the Tiangui Star》Little Whirlwind Chai Jin

This man has maintained his residence in Cangzhou for generations. He is a descendant of Chai Shizong of the Great Zhou. Moreover, having received an iron tablet from Emperor Taizu Wude, his house never suffers from the calamities of warfare. Maintaining over fifty heroes and sparing no expense on wealth, he is called Master Chai. One year, he came to Gaotang Prefecture to visit his uncle Chai Huangcheng's illness. After Li Kui killed Yin Tianxi, the authority of his iron tablet was broken, and he incurred the wrath of Gao Lian, was forcibly captured and thrown into prison. When Song Jiang faintly heard of this, he worried as if fire were lit on his eyebrows, dispatched troops and advanced directly to the prefecture, wielding fierce authority to investigate. Finally finding the official in a deep well, he lowered Li Kui to rescue him and immediately took revenge on the spot. Following the advice of Song Jiang and others, he was invited to the water stronghold, preserving his family and securing his wife and children.

This is the Water Margin tale. Hong Xin brought chaos to the world through the evil forces of Dragon-Tiger Mountain, while Song Jiang brought order through the righteousness of Liangshan Marsh. Evil is like a serpent, while righteousness is like an ant. Though a serpent may be a hundred fathoms long and enormous, it merely resembles the wheat-straw crafts of Mount Fuji's reverse side seen in the sixth month. Though an ant is but an inch in size and extremely small, it can sometimes break through embankments or create deep pools. Great evil is easy to accomplish, while small righteousness is difficult to achieve.
That the small can triumph over the great - with this message, I encourage righteousness in children and write this preface by combining the modest strength of the 108 heroes.

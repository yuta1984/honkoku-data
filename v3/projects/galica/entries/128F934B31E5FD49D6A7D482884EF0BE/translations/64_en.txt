《Inserted text: Among the seventy-two Earth Fiend Stars, the Earth Form Star》Vegetable Garden Zhang Qing

This individual was originally from Beijing. In his youth, due to his connection with guarding the vegetable garden of Guangming Temple in the prefecture, he was nicknamed "Vegetable Garden." He quarreled with monks, burned down the temple, killed the temple administrator, and eloped. While wandering after coming to Mengzhou, he learned martial arts from the Mountain Yaksha Sun Yuan, and furthermore received his daughter Sun Erniang as his wife.

He established a wine shop on the mountain of Cross Slope, calling to passing travelers and forcibly recommending numbing wine. He watches as the poison circulates and their whole bodies become paralyzed, then strips their clothes, steals their wealth, and makes human flesh into steamed buns, selling these while deceiving customers that they taste like birds and beasts. Though he delights in slaughtering human lives like refuse, he swears to uphold three prohibitions against killing: first, wandering monks; second, prostitutes and courtesans; third, exiles and prisoners. Though the household has these prohibitions, his wife Erniang often breaks the oath and commits errors against figures like Lu Zhishen and Wu Song.

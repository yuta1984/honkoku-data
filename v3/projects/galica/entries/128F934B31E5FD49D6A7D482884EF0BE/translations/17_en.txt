《Interlinear note: Among the thirty-six members of the Heavenly Gang Stars, the Heavenly Leisure Star》Cloud-Entering Dragon Gongsun Sheng

This one person was originally from Suzhou. He called himself Master Yiqing. He entered the immortal sect of Master Luo of Mount Erxian and learned to summon clouds, mist, wind, and rain. Since his techniques were most accomplished, he was nicknamed "Cloud-Entering Dragon." His height exceeded eight feet, and he particularly cultivated martial arts. He joined forces with Chao Gai to seize treasure at Huangni Ridge, and fled to the water stronghold to avoid trouble. However, tormented by thoughts of his mother, he hid again in Mount Erxian. But his connection to Liangshan was strongest - what could be done? He appeared in the battle of Gaotang Prefecture to shatter Gao Lian's illusions, sometimes emitting strange light to drive away supernatural beasts, sometimes raising thunder and fire to burn divine soldiers. Against the demon army of Mount Mangdang, he first deployed the eight formations to capture Xiang Chong and Li Gun, and later made the demon general Fan Rui surrender and become his disciple. In military strategy, he matched the brilliance of the Resourceful Star (Wu Yong), serving as guide for the 108 heroes.

《Inserted text: Among the seventy-two Earth Fiend Stars, the Earth Strong Star》Mother Yaksha Sun Erniang

This woman is the wife of Zhang Qing. Her way of attracting customers at the wine shop entrance is like fishing for hungry fish at the end of a pole with delicious bait. Her head ornaments are iron rings used as hair decorations, and she uses wildflowers as hairpins. Though she applies neither rouge nor powder, when seen among woodcutter women and hunter's daughters, she is like a lotus blooming in a thicket of mugwort - beautiful in color and fragrance but with poison within, causing harm like a yaksha. When she was selected to join Liangshan, she sharpened her horns and honed her fangs; when she ascended to Liangshan Marsh again, she refined her loyalty and righteousness. The married couple serve together in formation, yielding merit to each other and assisting in battle. When following Wu Yong's commands, like ama divers and rice-planting women waving their sleeves, she breaks through barriers and conquers castles. Compared to this, even Mengguang's feat of lifting a large stone mortar with one hand is nothing special and not worth praising as remarkable anymore.

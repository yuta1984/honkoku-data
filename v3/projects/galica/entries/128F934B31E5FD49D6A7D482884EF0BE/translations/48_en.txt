These three men were originally from Shijie Village in Jizhou Prefecture, and though brothers, they were all fishermen. The eldest brother was nicknamed "Standing Earth Grand Year" (Ricchi-taisai), the middle brother was nicknamed "Short-lived Second Son" (Tanmei-jiro), and the youngest was nicknamed "Living Yama King" (Katsu-enra). On land, they skillfully wielded swords, spears, halberds, and pikes; in water, they swam freely, rising and diving, so that even water spirits would cover their faces and hide. Their skill at poling boats was masterful - whether with or against wind and current, moving in any direction, controlling speed and motion like pulling objects with thread.

One day, when Wu Yong came to visit them, the three brothers united as one, opened their hearts completely, and danced and leaped like sparrows. Their joy was as deep and boundless as the Ji River itself. They moored their boat at the shore where countless lotus flowers bloomed, held a banquet at the Inverted Water Pavilion, spoke of secret matters and discussed confidential plans. With their well-arranged great fish-like scheme, they netted ten thousand strings of cash, but in return they themselves would be caught in the officials' net.

Iron Caller Yue He
Having been deceived by Gao Qiu and held at a mansion in Tokyo (Kaifeng), Yan Qing and others devised a plan and communicated their intentions to Yue He. They threw a rope from outside the wall, tied it to a willow branch, and when they pulled strongly on the end from outside, Yue He escaped from that dangerous place just like a spider following its thread.

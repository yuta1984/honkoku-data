does not keep them is a liar, and the truth is not in that person. But whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God is truly perfected. By this we know that we are in Him. Whoever says he abides in Him ought to walk in the same way in which He walked.

Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard from the beginning. Again, I am writing you a new commandment, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. Whoever says he is in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.

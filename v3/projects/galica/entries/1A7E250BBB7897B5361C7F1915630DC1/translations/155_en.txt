are one. God testifies through water, blood, and spirit - these three things bear witness, and these three are one. If we accept human testimony, God's testimony is far greater. This is God's testimony, which He has given about His own Son. Whoever believes in the Son of God has this testimony within their heart. Whoever does not believe God has made Him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about His Son.

And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life, because you believe in the name of the Son of God.

This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.

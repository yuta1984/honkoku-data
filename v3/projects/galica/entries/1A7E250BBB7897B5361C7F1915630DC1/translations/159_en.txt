you shall receive much reward. All people must not turn away from Christ's teachings. Such a person is not a ruler of heaven; those who listen to Christ's teachings - with them the heavenly Father and Son abide. When people come to you, do not welcome into your house those who do not know these teachings, and therefore do not greet them. Those who follow such a person share in that person's evil deeds. I do not intend to write many things to you with ink on paper, but I hope to come to you and speak together face to face. Through this we shall rejoice in many things. The children of your chosen sister send you greetings.
In this truth〇【.】

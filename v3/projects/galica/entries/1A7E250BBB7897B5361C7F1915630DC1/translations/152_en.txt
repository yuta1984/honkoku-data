comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. God himself is love. Whoever does not love does not know God. God sent his one and only Son into the world so that we might live through him. This is how God's love was revealed among us. Love is like this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God. But if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and testify.

The master of the feast did not know where it came from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew. Jesus had turned the water into wine, and when he tasted it, he was amazed by the flavor. The master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now." This was the first sign that Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and he manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him.

After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days. The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there. And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen.

as He is in the light, if we walk in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of His Son Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. However, if we say we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.

He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments. Whoever says "I know Him" but does not keep His commandments

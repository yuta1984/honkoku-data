Sumatra (Sumandara), also called Samadara, is an island nation north of Java. This too is a very hot country where the people and customs are of low quality, there is no sovereign ruler, and each person rules their own territory without conflict. This country is said to produce gold and silver, but the people do not seek to mine much of it. When they occasionally obtain gold nuggets, they trade them with travelers. Both the northern and southern pole stars can be seen. Also, to the east of this country is Brunei, where the people and customs are similar, and it is a constantly hot country. Therefore, it is not described separately. Java, Sumatra, Brunei and others are close to Megaranica.

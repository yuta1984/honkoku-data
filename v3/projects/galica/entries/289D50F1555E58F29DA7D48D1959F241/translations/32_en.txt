Tonkin has belonged to China since ancient times and uses Chinese characters. The language is particularly different [from Chinese]. What China anciently called Kōchi (Cochinchina) was this country. In later ages it divided into two countries, with the eastern region called Tonkin and the southern region called Tainan (Cochinchina). Now only the southern region is called Kōchi. Because their customs are similar, we do not separately illustrate Kōchi. Both are warm countries, located approximately fifteen to sixteen degrees north of the equator.

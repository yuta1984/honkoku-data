The Great Qing is the current name of China. Since the emperor's homeland is Tartary (the Mongol-Manchu regions), they reformed the customs of the Great Ming period. For this reason, the illustrations of the two countries are separated to show the differences between ancient and modern customs. However, regarding the administrative divisions of two capitals and thirteen provinces, writing systems, classical texts and historical records, and scholarly methods, no changes were made from the previous dynasty.

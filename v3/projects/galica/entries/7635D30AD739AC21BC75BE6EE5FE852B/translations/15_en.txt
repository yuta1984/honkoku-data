A man named Kakizaki Yoshihiro first entered service with the Toyotomi family. Subsequently, in the winter of Keichō 4 (1599), he was granted an audience with Shinsō (Tokugawa Ieyasu). From that time, he was granted the court rank of Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, and was made to take the name Matsumae Shima-no-kami, with his descendants being enfeoffed in Matsumae for generations. This would be the correct account.

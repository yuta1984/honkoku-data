《Crossed-out marginal note: Could Ohotskoi be the so-called Bohai Kingdom? The Bohai Kingdom is mentioned in the Hakubutsushi (Natural History). Also, the Shoku Nihongi (Chronicles of Japan Continued) states: In the reign of Emperor Kanmu, in the 5th year of Enryaku, 9th month, day of Kinoe-tatsu, a report from Dewa Province stated that Bohai envoy Ambassador Li Yuantai and 65 others aboard one ship drifted ashore. They were plundered by local Ezo, with 12 killed and 41 survivors. In the same 6th year, 2nd month, day of Kinoe-inu, Bohai envoy Li Yuantai and others reported that when Yuantai's group was coming to court, the pilots and oarsmen encountered bandits and were killed and robbed, having no means to return to their country. Thereupon, [the court] ordered Echigo Province to provide one ship, pilots, oarsmen, and sailors and dispatched them.》

They brew sake (for this purpose, they use approximately one year's harvest to obtain rice koji and make unrefined sake; the wealthy make more than ten koku, while other villagers also make sake according to their means, bringing it to offer to the chief to prepare together). They prepare bears (they also raise bears in advance for this purpose). The villagers and relatives, regardless of distance, are called together as guests. They arrange the seating properly, each performs ritual bows, and after finishing, they drink the homemade sake. After two rounds, the host brings out bow and arrows and presents them to the guests.

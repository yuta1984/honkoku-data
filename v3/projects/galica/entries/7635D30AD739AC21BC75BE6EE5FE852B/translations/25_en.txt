[The host] gives [arrows] to each guest and requests them to shoot the bear that has been kept and offered on the altar. The guests also decline to shoot first and defer to the host. Then the host takes up his bow and arrows, faces the heavens, earth, and four directions, and performs the shooting ritual. Next, all the guests stand and shoot the bear. There are also offerings made to the bear that has been shot and killed. When this is finished, they cut up the bear, cook the meat, and then hold a feast.

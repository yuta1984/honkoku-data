The chieftain of a village worships the deities of heaven, earth, fire, wind, and water. Heaven is called Kantou Kamui, fire is Abe Kamui, earth is Kannashiri Kamui, wind is Rera Kamui, and water is Waatsuka Kamui. This ceremony is called Yaumande. To perform this ritual, they set up an altar and erect ritual offerings (Inaho/Nusa) in the four directions. They carve willow wood to create flower-like decorations. They display the treasures found in that place, including Japanese weapons and items of the Kuhasaki and Shitoki types.

IX
THE RAT AND THE OYSTER

　　A rat, inhabitant of a field, a rat of little brain,
　　One day found himself weary of his paternal lares.
　　He leaves there the field, the grain and the sheaf,
　　Goes to roam the country, abandons his hole.
　　　　As soon as he was out of his dwelling:
"How great and spacious the world is!" he said.
"There are the Apennines, and here is the Caucasus!"
The smallest molehill was a mountain to his eyes.
After a few days the traveler arrives
In a certain region where Tethys on the shore
Had left many an oyster; and our rat at first
Thought he saw, upon seeing them, ships of the line.
"Certainly," he said, "my father was a poor fellow!
He dared not travel, fearful to the utmost degree.
As for me, I have already seen the maritime empire:
I have crossed the deserts; but we did not drink there."
The rat held these things from a certain schoolmaster,
　　　　And told them throughout the fields,
Not being one of those rats who, gnawing books,
　　　　Make themselves learned to their teeth.

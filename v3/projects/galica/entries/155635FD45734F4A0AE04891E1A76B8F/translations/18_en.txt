　　　　　　VIII 
THE SUN AND THE FROGS

　At a tyrant's wedding, all the people in celebration
　　　　Drowned their sorrows in drink.
Aesop alone thought that the people were foolish
　　　　To show so much joy.
The Sun, he said, once had the intention
　　　　To think of marriage.
At once there was heard, with one voice,
　　　　Complaints about their fate
　　　　From the female citizens of the ponds.
　What shall we do if he has children?
They said to Fate: one sun alone can barely
　Be endured; half a dozen
Would dry up the sea and all its inhabitants.
Farewell, reeds and marshes: our race is destroyed;
　　　　Soon it will be reduced
To the waters of the Styx. For a poor animal,
The frogs, in my opinion, reasoned quite well.

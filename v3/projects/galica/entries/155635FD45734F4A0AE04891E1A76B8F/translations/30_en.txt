THE FOX AND THE CAT

　　The cat and the fox, like beautiful little saints,
　　　　Went off on pilgrimage.
　　They were two true hypocrites, two arch-flatterers;
Two genuine rogues, who for the expenses of the journey,
Devouring many a fowl, pilfering many a cheese,
　　　　Compensated themselves each trying to outdo the other.
The road was long, and therefore tedious;
　　　　To shorten it they argued.
　　　　Argument is of great help:
　　　　Without it one would always sleep.
　　　　Our pilgrims raised their voices;
Having argued well, they spoke of their neighbor.
　　　　The fox finally said to the cat:
　　　　"You claim to be very clever:
Do you know as much as I? I have a hundred tricks in my bag."
"No," said the other: "I have only one trick in my knapsack;
　　　　But I maintain that it is worth a thousand."
They began to argue again competitively.
On the "yes it is," "no it isn't," both being thus engaged,

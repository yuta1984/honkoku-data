Employ me; for my relatives
All hold the highest ranks:
A cousin of mine is judge-mayor.
The dauphin said: Much obliged;
And does the Piraeus also share
In the honor of your presence?
You see him often, I suppose?--
Every day: he is my friend;
He's an old acquaintance.
Our ape took, this time,
The name of a port for a man's name.

There are many such people
Who would mistake Vaugirard for Rome,
And who, chattering most volubly,
Speak of everything, yet have seen nothing.

The dauphin laughed, turned his head,
And, having considered the ape,
He perceived that he had drawn
From the depths of the waters nothing but a beast.
He plunged it back in, and went to find
Some man, in order to save him.

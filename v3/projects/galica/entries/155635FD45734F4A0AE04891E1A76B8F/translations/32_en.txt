　　Then each duck takes hold of one end of the stick.
When the turtle is lifted up, people everywhere are amazed
　　　　To see traveling in this manner
　　　　The slow animal and its house,
Right in the middle between the two goslings.
"A miracle!" they cried: "Come see in the clouds
　　　　The queen of turtles passing by!"
"The queen! Yes indeed: I am one in fact;
Don't mock me." She would have done much better
To continue on her way without saying anything;
For, releasing the stick by loosening her teeth,
She falls and dies at the feet of the onlookers.
Her indiscretion was the cause of her ruin.

Imprudence, chatter, and foolish vanity,
　　　　And vain curiosity,
　　　　Are all closely related:
　　　　They are children all of the same lineage.

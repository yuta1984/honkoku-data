IV
THE WOLF AND THE CRANE

　　Wolves eat gluttonously.
　　A wolf, being at a feast,
　　Hurried so much, it is said,
　　That he nearly lost his life:
A bone remained lodged deep in his throat.
Fortunately for this wolf, who could not cry out,
　　A crane passed nearby.
　　　　He signaled to her; she rushed over.
The surgeon immediately set to work.
She withdrew the bone, then, for such good service,
　　She asked for her payment.
　　Your payment! said the wolf.
　　Are you joking, my good neighbor?
　　What! Is it not reward enough
To have withdrawn your neck from my throat!
　　Go, you are ungrateful:
　　Never fall under my paw.

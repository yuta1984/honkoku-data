　　Among so many oysters all closed,
One had opened, and, yawning in the sun,
　　Rejoiced by a gentle zephyr,
It inhaled the air, breathed, and was in full bloom;
White, fat, and of a taste, to behold, without equal.
As soon as the rat sees this gaping oyster from afar:
"What do I perceive?" he says, "it is some victuals,
And, if I am not mistaken about the color of this dish,
I must feast well today, or never."
Thereupon master rat, full of fair hope,
Approaches the shell, stretches his neck a little,
Feels himself caught as in snares; for the oyster suddenly
Closes. And behold what ignorance does.

This fable contains more than one teaching:
　　We see there firstly
That those who have no experience of the world
Are, at the slightest objects, struck with amazement:
　　And then we can learn there
　　That he who thought to catch is caught.

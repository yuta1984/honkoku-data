THE HERON

One day, on his long legs, was walking, I know not where,
The heron with his long beak mounted on a long neck.
　　　　He was skirting a river.
The water was transparent as on the most beautiful days;
My friend the carp was making a thousand turns there
　　　　With the pike, her companion.
The heron could have easily made his profit from it:
All were approaching the shore; the bird had only to take them.
　　　　But he thought it better to wait
　　　　Until he had a little more appetite.
He lived by regimen and ate at his hours.
After some moments appetite came: the bird,
　　　　Approaching the shore, saw on the water
Tench that were coming out from the bottom of those dwellings.
The dish did not please him; he expected better,
　　　　And showed a disdainful taste,
　　　　Like the rat of good Horace.
Me, tench! said he; me, a heron, that I should make
Such poor fare! And for whom do they take me?
The tench spurned, he found some gudgeon.
Gudgeon! that's quite the dinner for a heron!
Would I open my beak for so little, gods forbid!
He opened it for much less: everything went in such a way
　　　　That he saw no more fish at all.
Hunger seized him: he was very happy and very pleased
　　　　To encounter a snail.

　　　　Let us not be so difficult;
The most accommodating are the most skillful:
One risks losing by wanting to gain too much.
　　　　Beware of disdaining anything.

I
THE ROOSTER AND THE FOX

On the branch of a tree stood sentinel
An old rooster, clever and cunning.
"Brother," said a fox, softening his voice,
"We are no longer in quarrel;
General peace this time.
I come to announce it to you; come down, let me embrace you:
Do not delay me, please;
I must make twenty posts today without fail.
You and yours can attend
To your affairs without any fear;
We will serve you as brothers.
Light your celebration fires this very evening;
And meanwhile come receive
The kiss of fraternal love!"

"Friend," replied the rooster, "I could never
Learn sweeter and better news
Than this
Of this peace;
And it is double joy for me
To hear it from you. I see two greyhounds
Who, I am sure, are messengers
Sent for this very purpose:
They run fast, and will be with us in a moment.
I am coming down: we will all be able to embrace each other."

"Farewell," said the fox, "my journey is long to make:
We will rejoice over the success of this affair
Another time." The rogue immediately
Takes to his heels, gains the heights,
Ill-content with his stratagem.
And our old rooster to himself
Began to laugh at his fear;

For it is double pleasure to deceive the deceiver.

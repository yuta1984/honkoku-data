XIII 
THE TURTLE AND THE TWO DUCKS

　There was a turtle with a light head,
　Who, weary of her hole, wanted to see the country.
People readily value a foreign land,
People with limping legs readily hate their dwelling.
　　　　Two ducks to whom the gossip
　　　　Communicated this beautiful design,
Told her they had the means to satisfy her.
　　　　Do you see that wide road?
We will transport you, by air, to America:
　　　　You will see many a republic,
Many a kingdom, many a people; and you will profit
From the different customs that you will observe.
Ulysses did as much. One hardly expected
　　　　To see Ulysses in this affair.
The turtle listened to the proposition.
The bargain struck, the birds forge a machine
　　　　To transport the pilgrim.
In her mouth crosswise they place a stick.
Hold tight, they said, be careful not to let go.

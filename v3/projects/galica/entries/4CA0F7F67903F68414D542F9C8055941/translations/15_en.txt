[From the fourth line]
[Manjushri] taught the Buddhist teachings together with others, and when he went to the Dragon Palace world, he preached the Lotus Sutra and guided the dragon deities. Above all, in such times, long ago in a past life, when Manjushri Bodhisattva was by a pond, he saw a young woman standing at the edge of the pond trying to throw herself in. Manjushri, finding this strange, caught the woman's sleeve and asked, "For what reason do you seek to throw yourself into this pond?" The woman answered, "My husband's heart is not constant, he speaks with other women and looks upon me with disdain, and his affection has grown thin. This resentment is beyond words. At least by throwing myself into this pond and becoming a great serpent, I will kill those hateful men and women as I please." Manjushri heard this and tried in various ways to console and restrain her, but the anger and flames in her breast would never cease. She broke free and entered the pond. Manjushri took pity and threw the Lotus Sutra he held in his hand into the water. Through the merit of this sutra touching the woman's body, she was guided to be reborn in the Dragon Palace world and became the daughter of the Dragon King Sagara. Due to her deep past merit, she suffered none of the torments of the three evil paths, was superior in wisdom and deep in compassion, and was already eight years old. At this time, when the Buddha appeared in the world and preached the Lotus Sutra, Manjushri went from that assembly to the Dragon Palace, and as the ancient karmic connection had ripened, he preached the Lotus Sutra for that eight-year-old dragon girl. The dragon girl, being superior in wisdom, immediately understood the wondrous principles of the Lotus Sutra, went with Manjushri to Vulture Peak, gained here the benefit of becoming a male, and while being born in the Southern Pure World, achieved rebirth and perfect enlightenment.

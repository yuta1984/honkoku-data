"This won't work," he withdraws and applies saliva, coating the head repeatedly, then positions it again and with one firm push, it slips in smoothly with satisfying ease. "Now it will be easier," and slowly, slowly he begins to move, gradually pushing in to the root. The girl breathes heavily and rapidly, "uhn, uhn, mmm, mmm" in pleasant response, her love juices flowing forth in pulses. The man, triumphant, moves his hips large and small, streaming with sweat. The girl gasps "ahh, ahh, ahh, ahhh, oh my, haa, haa, haa," while the man too, wordlessly "ahh, ahh, ahh, haa, haa, haa, haa" in complete absorption. The girl presses and rubs her bottom against the wooden floor of the corridor, "haa, haa, ahh, ahh" their breathing together, both climaxing at once in throbbing pulses. Truly, they have consummated their vows in this cavern corridor.

From twenty-four or twenty-five years old comes the middle-aged beauty with the true flavor of passionate maturity, and those from twenty-seven or twenty-eight to their thirties are all skilled and expert, none of them declining in appeal. Among these, the middle-aged beauty is truly the most delicious, thought a certain man who had long kept this in mind. There was a woman temporarily staying at the neighboring house who appeared to be just what he was looking for and caught his fancy somewhat, so he tried to approach her. Whether they exchanged loquat leaf tea or not is unclear, but they easily came to an arrangement, and watching for their chance in the garden, he first had her crouch in a good spot, made her lift one leg, and began to penetrate her. Even intercourse in a crouching position, both being experienced, and the man being in his sexual prime and eager to taste her flavor, he thoroughly explored inside her opening with the tip of his member and found inside much soft flesh resembling a rooster's comb that pleasured his member most delightfully. "This is certainly undeniable," he thought to himself, while the woman also gripped his member firmly, saying "What a pleasurable organ this is! First of all it's thick with a high ridge, thick veins and bumps. It would be wonderful to have a man with such a fine member as a husband." They both felt intense pleasure, and though they parted that same night, this became an addiction for both of them. Eventually he received her from her family, and no matter what superior openings or superior members there might be, they lived together harmoniously without growing tired of each other - truly they were well-matched as a good married couple.

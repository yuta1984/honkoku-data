Regarding the order of the imperial procession, though we attempt to imitate it in the paintings on the right, our efforts are inadequate. These things are beyond number, and the magnificence of that occasion is truly beyond the reach of pen and tongue to describe. The spectators throughout the capital, hearing reports from various provinces - such imperial majesty has never appeared in any record since the founding of this nation. The decorations along the Horikawa were adorned with gold and silver, and the manner of the imperial procession, with court nobles, courtiers, and various officials in proper order, was so magnificent that when performed triumphantly with sho flutes, hichiriki oboes, and string instruments, it seemed the sound might reach even to the heavens. Such events would surely have no witnesses in distant provinces and remote villages. Though it would be presumptuous to claim we could show such distant places what it was like, it is for the purpose of conveying this that we attempt to imitate it in paintings. It is said that this rivals even the great occasions of China and our own court's history.

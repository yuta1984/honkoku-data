and used this person as an accomplice, secretly forging an official letter purporting that Lord Yoshiaki was summoning the foreigner, and dispatched Gen'nai as an imperial envoy to the western provinces. When Gen'nai arrived in Kyushu and presented the official letter to the Ryūzōji, Takashige examined the letter and, not knowing it was a forgery, respectfully and humbly complied, immediately having the retainers Nakanishi Kenmotsu and Sasahara Yazaemon accompany [the foreigner] up to Kyoto. Nobunaga dispatched troops to the Toba Yotsuzuka area to receive them and brought them back to the castle town of Azuchi in Ōmi Province. When the Ryūzōji escort returned and reported to Takashige about Nobunaga's secret plot, Takashige was greatly enraged but could do nothing about it. This foreigner's arrival in the capital was on the third day of the ninth month.

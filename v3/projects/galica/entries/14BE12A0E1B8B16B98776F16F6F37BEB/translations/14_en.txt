The barbarians traveled from Wakasa Province to Kaizu in Ōmi Province, floated their ships on the lake and reached Ōtsu, entered the Southern Barbarian temple in Kyoto, had an audience with the Portuguese, and reported to Nobunaga. Nobunaga was pleased and summoned them to Azuchi. The arrived Southern Barbarians entered Myōhonji temple and awaited orders. Thus three Southern Barbarians ascended to the castle and had an audience with Nobunaga. Their ceremonial etiquette followed the Portuguese Padre manner. The Portuguese Padre who arrived this time was one shaku and five sun taller than the Portuguese, with a pale complexion and yellow hair and beard. His clothing was of aito (linen cloth) like the Portuguese. Both Irmãos were remarkable in both medical arts and external treatments. <<Since the time when the Portuguese first came to Azuchi>> <<Hasegawa Take was ordered to serve as interpreter for the Southern Barbarians>> On this occasion, there were six types of offerings.

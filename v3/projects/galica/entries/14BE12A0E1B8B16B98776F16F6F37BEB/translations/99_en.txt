[The people's] reverence was without limit. Afterwards, [Christ] ascended to heaven in his living body. If this is so, then apart from this law, there is no other way to save people. This present life is but a dream. One should quickly convert to this doctrine. When preaching this law, those who listen to the teachings request to enter the religious sect. At this point, the Padre performs the ritual of initiation. On the forehead of a person becoming a believer for the first time, [the Padre] places a white cloth, has them hold a candle in their hand, puts salt in their mouth, and the Padre takes water and pours it on the person's head. There are recited prayers. Also, [the person] enters the Padre's room and makes confession. At this time, [the Padre] gives wheat bread. [The person] receives this and eats it. [The Padre] also gives grape wine. [The person] receives this and drinks it.

The two padres and two irmãos had nowhere to place their hands and feet, and were simply bewildered and confused when Masuda and Natsuka pressed forward, surrounded the temple grounds, captured every single person there without exception, and reported to Lord Hideyoshi.

Those who do not reside in Japan need not be subjected to Japanese criminal punishment. Send them to Nagasaki in Hizen, put them aboard Dutch ships, and if they come to Japan again, they shall be executed the second time." Tell them to return to their home country and relay this message.

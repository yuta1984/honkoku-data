and then made them into Irmãos (lay brothers), having them preach religious doctrines. Here they employed deceptive methods to deceive and confuse the people. First, they would not openly reveal the principles of their own faith, nor would they openly slander the teachings of other religions. Instead, they would use charitable giving and kind words to make people grateful for their benevolence. Then, from time to time, they would speak gentle words, secretly praising their own faith while subtly disparaging other religions. When their listeners reached a state of half-belief and half-doubt, they would tell such people: "Listen and learn about the superiority or inferiority of the Christian faith and the source of its teachings. If our doctrine does not accord with your heart, you should maintain the principles of your original religion. But if you comprehend the true source of our religion, then you should convert to our faith."

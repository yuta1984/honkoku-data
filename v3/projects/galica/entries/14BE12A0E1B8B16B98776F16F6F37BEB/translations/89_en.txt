Compared to the Lord God's beginningless and endless nature, [Zen] represents excessively lofty discourse and a doctrine of emptiness. A monk asked Jōshū, "Does a dog have Buddha-nature or not?" Jōshū replied, "No" (mu). This single case dialogue represents the supreme subtlety of Śākyamuni's lifetime teaching and the ultimate doctrine above all Buddhas. Using only the single character "mu" (nothing/no) to answer another's question—what does this mean? It is because [they] do not know that Deus exists. Those who speak of self-awakening and becoming Buddha follow a false teaching. If one relies on Deus, why would one not attain the pleasures of heaven? Now, what we call deities (shingi) are [formed when] people die, and their descendants build shrines and temples to revere their ancestors. Or when people die, their souls become vengeful spirits that move people emotionally. They worship these spirits and make them into divine beings (shinmei). Sometimes the spirits of animals also torment people.

"If the deliberation on the forceful petition is delayed, they will likely come bearing sacred palanquins and such again, which would cause disturbances in Kyoto. Orders should be given to Nobunaga quickly." Thus, through Kazanin Middle Counselor Hiromasa, the content of the mountain gate's petition was conveyed as an imperial command to Nobunaga. Although Nobunaga was displeased, he obeyed the imperial command and renamed Eiroku-ji as Nanban-ji (Southern Barbarian Temple). Consequently, he donated land worth 500 koku in Kōka District of Ōmi Province. The temple's architectural structure and magnificence were eye-opening. Furthermore, it was commanded that "Organtino alone cannot match the power needed for spreading the dharma. Several people should be summoned from his home country." Organtino rejoiced and sent word to his home country. Now, the Southern Barbarian Christian countries are called by the country names Hispania, Portugal, and Castile, and are located over 12,000 ri across the sea from Japan.

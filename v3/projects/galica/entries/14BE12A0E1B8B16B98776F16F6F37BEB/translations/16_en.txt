<<[they do]>> Not only that, but they brought vast treasures from their home country and exchanged them for gold and silver, making necklaces of seven treasures, banners of gold brocade, canopies of silk brocade, and burning sixty-one varieties of famous incense that reached even outside the gate, causing passersby to stop. <<It is said that this temple always does not place a main deity on the Buddhist altar>> Hearing of this, people came in great numbers not only from the Five Home Provinces but also from Shikoku, Chūgoku, and provinces near the capital, and the Southern Barbarian temple formed crowds daily. However, those who did not submit to the religion (Christianity) were not allowed to worship the main deity. The Southern Barbarian temple paid no attention to these crowds of people, but sent people out to Rakuchū and Rakugai, searching even in mountain shrines at crossroads, under bridges, and other places, bringing back outcasts, beggars, and those with serious or incurable diseases, having them bathe to cleanse their bodies.

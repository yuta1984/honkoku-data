[The notation system continues:] For single words, large circles are used to separate them. For items that should be read with auxiliary kana, small circles are placed between characters like "ハ●ウ" and "カ●ウ" to prevent confusion with the sounds "ho" and "ko." For words that have breaks within a single term, small dots (like plum pits) are marked. This compilation has many omissions. Soon, a second volume will be published additionally to supplement what is lacking.

This can be understood by looking at the map. Master Hakuseki said that the place called Yasaku on the world map is probably this Karafuto. Now, the area extending to its northwest is all treacherous mountains and rocks, making passage difficult. Beyond those mountains to the northwest, there are places called Santan and Manchu. Santan is not yet clarified. Manchu is probably Manchuria. I think that from Karafuto to the capital of Manchuria is not extremely far. ○ According to the records of the drift of Tōemon and others from Mikuni-ura in Echizen Province during the Kan'ei era, they first landed near North Korea, then traveled overland for thirty days to reach the capital of Manchuria, then another thirty-odd days to enter Beijing, then another thirty-odd days to reach the capital of Korea, then another twelve days to reach Busan port and return to Tsushima. Their daily travel distance was seven to eight ri by Japanese roads, so the approximate distance can be calculated by measuring the number of days.

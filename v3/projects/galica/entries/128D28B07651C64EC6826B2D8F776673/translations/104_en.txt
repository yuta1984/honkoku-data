is the Kuroshio (Black Current). I have heard that navigating through this current requires great skill and knowledge. However, in summer and autumn this current flows gently, while in winter and spring it becomes a great rapid current. The members of the Shimatani family crossed to the uninhabited islands departing from Shimoda in early intercalary fourth month and returning to the same place in late sixth month of the same year, which was during the calm season for this current. Therefore, it seems they passed through without witnessing the treacherous nature of this current. This may be why they did not record it. ○In my opinion, among those eighty-odd islands, if the largest island has a circumference of fifteen ri, it would be comparable to Iki Island. If the second largest island has a circumference of ten ri, it would be comparable to Amakusa Island. Additionally, there are eight islands ranging from two ri to six or seven ri in circumference. In total, these ten islands have harbors and flat land where people could reside and cultivate the five grains. Moreover, being in a warm climate region, they produce rare and exotic items.

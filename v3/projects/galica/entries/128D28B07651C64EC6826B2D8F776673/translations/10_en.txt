These countries border our nation territorially and are truly neighboring countries. I believe that the people of our country, regardless of noble or humble status, regardless of civil or military position, should know the geography of these three countries. When one is thoroughly familiar with this, one will not be confused or doubtful about times of order and disorder. All affairs become easy to implement, and there are times when one should demonstrate strength and times when one should know and take pleasure. Moreover, even when people enter the three countries on official business, if they carry this map with them, the boundaries of the three countries will become clear as if they were right before their eyes, and they can proceed there with composure. This is what I intend by creating this map and showing it to the people of the world. It seems to provide some benefit to military arts.

Regarding the geography of all nations, nothing surpasses knowing it. However, when one stubbornly adheres to details, one inevitably falls into pedantic hair-splitting. It is sufficient to know only the general outline of direction, size, climate, strength and weakness, and so forth.

The map of our country shows only the ports of the overseas countries in all four directions, and does not present the complete form.

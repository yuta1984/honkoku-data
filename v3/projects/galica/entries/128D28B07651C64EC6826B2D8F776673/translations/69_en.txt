For understanding the general situation of Ezo country, there are no other books besides these three works. Therefore, what I, this humble scholar, describe now is also based on these three books, and in addition to this, I have added Russian accounts and selected and collected explanations from sailors who have crossed the seas to that country, comparing and contrasting various sources to produce a clean copy. Hence, there are already many new theories. Since the old theories are extensively recorded in the three books, I do not write them here.

Regarding people from Korea and Ryukyu, they have come as envoys to our country for generations and are seen by many people, so I do not include their illustrations. As for the Ezo people, even people from Ou (northern Honshu) have never seen them, let alone others. Therefore, I only illustrate the general appearance of their people, clothing, implements, and such.

Regarding the dialect of that country, I have heard and learned many things, but since the text would become lengthy, I do not record them. I only list below the dialect names for numbers from one to ten.

One (Shinetsupu), Two (Totsupu), Three (Retsupu), Four (Inetsupu), Five (Ashitsuki), Six (Iwan), Seven (Aruwan), Eight (Tobeshi), Nine (Shinebeshi), Ten (Too)

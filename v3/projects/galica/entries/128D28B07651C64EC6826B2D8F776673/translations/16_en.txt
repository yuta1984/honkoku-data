To the west and north of this country there are two long rivers, which mark the boundaries where Korean territory ends. Between these two rivers there are great mountains such as Baideng Mountain and Changbai Mountain that separate the terrain, so it is said that there is no overland route to China proper, but in reality it is connected by land to Liaodong and is not a separate island.

The two capitals of this country are the royal castle in Gyeonggi Province and Jinju in Gyeongsang Province. ○The division of the country into eight provinces is as follows:

Gyeonggi Province (Kenkitai): Twenty-eight administrative units - four mok, nine bu, eight gun, five ryeong, twelve gam, six yeok, six bo, two naval judges, nine guard ships, nine medium ships, one naval commander, one inspector, two myriarchs.

Gangwon Province (Kangwontai): Twenty-six administrative units - one mok, six bu, seven gun, three ryeong, nine gam, four yeok, five bo, one inspector, two myriarchs.

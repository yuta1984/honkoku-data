should be done. This represents a perspective that considers Ezo territory as part of Japan's domain. The reason for this is as follows: in ancient times, not only the true Ezo but even the lands of Ōshū and Ushū did not submit to imperial civilization and constantly showed disrespect to the imperial court, yet through the martial virtue of two or three generals they were pacified, and now conversely, seventy ri of Ezo land has become a territory under the loose control of the upper country (mainland Japan) {{marginal note: namely, the seventy ri territory of Matsumae}}.

Since that time, the Ezo people have come to revere the upper country, and it is said that in the present age, the Ezo people as a whole have strong desires to become people of the upper country. At this time, if even small measures were implemented, their customs would immediately transform and they would quickly become people of the upper country—this would be easier than turning one's palm. There are meaningful stories regarding all of this matter, but I do not record them out of consideration for taboo subjects.

There are many records about the Ezo in the Nihon Shoki (Chronicles of Japan). Among them, in the Saimei Chronicle, there is mention of establishing a government office at Shiribe (later Yōtei). In my opinion, this Shiribe Yōtei likely refers to the true Shiribeshi.

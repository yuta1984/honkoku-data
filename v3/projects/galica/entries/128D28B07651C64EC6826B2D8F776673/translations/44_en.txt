The products traded from Karafuto to Ezo include blue jade, eagle feathers, tobacco pipes, python trim, patterned silk, and fine silk fabrics. Among these, blue jade is a product of Karafuto. Eagle feathers are products of both Karafuto and Ezo. The tobacco pipes appear to be Tartar goods, all carved with Manchu characters. The python trim, patterned silk, and fine silk fabrics are Chinese goods that come from Beijing through Manchuria to Karafuto, then through Soya to Matsumae. However, between Ezo and Karafuto, there are many hidden rocks in the sea and towering mountain ranges on land, making passage difficult by both routes, so there is no large-scale trade, only a small flow of goods.

In the eastern sea of Ezo, there are thirty-seven islands called the Thousand Islands that are recorded in maps and books. Among these, only two have contact with Ezo: Kunashiri and Etorofu. Beyond these thirty-seven islands to the east, there is another country called Kamshikatsutoka (in the Ezo language).

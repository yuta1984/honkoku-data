There is a river called Kurose River, which is over twenty chō wide and has very rapid currents. It is difficult to cross straight across by boat, and great skill and knowledge are required. Generally, boat navigation is easy in summer and autumn, but difficult in winter and spring. It is also said that if one sails out to the waters south of Toba in Shima Province and heads east, the sea route becomes quite easy.

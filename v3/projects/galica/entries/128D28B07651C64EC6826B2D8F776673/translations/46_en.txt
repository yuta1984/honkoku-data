they say. Now, east of this Kamshikatsutoka there is no land to conquer. Therefore, turning their attention west again, there appears to be an opportunity to take control of those Thousand Islands. The reason is that in the far east of the Thousand Islands, there is a large island called Rakko Island, also known as Kurumuse (Kurumuse is another name for Kamshikatsutoka. Since Rakko Island is close to Kamshikatsutoka, the Ezo people confuse them and also call this island Kurumuse).

This island also appears to have fallen into their hands, and recently many Muscovians are said to be residing on this island. Using this as their base, they now come to Etorofu, which is close to Ezo, to conduct trade (among these trade goods are said to be southern sea products like pepper, sugar, and crimson cloth. What might be the reason that these southern country products come to this region - there is room for consideration). However, their true intentions in coming to trade are difficult to fathom. Perhaps they have ambitions to swallow up Etorofu? Now, when asked what country they come from, they answer "Oroshiya," so the Ezo people relate, I hear.

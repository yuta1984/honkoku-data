Mujin Island (Uninhabited Island) - A map is made separately on one sheet and attached to this volume
《Note: The original name of this island is Ogasawara Island, but since everyone commonly calls it Mujin Island (Uninhabited Island), we follow that convention and label it as Mujin Island. It was named Ogasawara Island because long ago, a certain Mr. Ogasawara discovered this island and brought back a map, hence the name. This was two hundred years ago. It is similar to how the Italian Magellan found a new world in the south and immediately named it Magellanica》

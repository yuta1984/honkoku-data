This is the general outline of the tribute and reciprocal gift exchange.

In ancient times, the one who founded that country is called Tensōshi. The dynasty continued for several thousand years, but when virtue declined, civil war broke out and the country was divided into three parts: the so-called Sannan, Chūzan, and Sanhoku. Later, the lord of Chūzan unified Sannan and Sanhoku under one rule. There are also the ceremonies when Chinese imperial envoys arrived in that country, the historical accounts of Hachirō Tametomo entering that country, the occasions when that country entered China or Japan, or the circumstances when that country was defeated by Satsuma forces - all these should be recorded in detail, but since they are unrelated to geography, I do not write about them. Moreover, for detailed accounts of the political upheavals, rise and fall of that country, there are the "Chūzan Denshin-roku" and Master Hakuseki's "Ryūkyū Jiryaku." Through these two books, one should learn about the past and present conditions of Ryūkyū.

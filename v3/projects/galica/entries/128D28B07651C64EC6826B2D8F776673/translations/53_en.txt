Among medicinal products, there are ikema and eburiko. These two medicines are taken by the Ainu people when they have illnesses. There are other medicinal products besides these, but they do not know how to use them. Eburiko is a mushroom.

For treating bruises, cuts, colds, and swellings, ikema is used, it is said.

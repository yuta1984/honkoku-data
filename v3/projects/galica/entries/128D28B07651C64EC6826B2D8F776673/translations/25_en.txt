In that country, the currency in regular use is our country's Kan'ei Tsūhō coins (there have been no national coins since ancient times).
That country is small and sandwiched between the two great powers of Japan and Tōzan (China). Therefore, it submits to both countries and sends envoys to both courts. When sending envoys to Japan, they use Japanese era names, and when sending envoys to Tōzan, they use Tōzan's era names. This is because their national strength is insufficient. However, they keep secret from Japan their sending of envoys to Tōzan, and keep secret from Tōzan their sending of envoys to Japan. From this, one might say that Tōzan's authority carries more weight than Japan's.
In that country, there are said to be many shrines dedicated to Ise Grand Shrine, Hachiman, Kumano, Tenman-gū, and others.
The current ruler of the Ryukyu Kingdom is truly of the bloodline of Minamoto no Hachirō Tametomo, as the people of that country also claim.

Because the wind stopped, they sought a southward course and gradually advanced their boat for several days when they suddenly saw a great country. This country is called "Edorofu" (Iturup). Following the coast southwest for eight days and nights, the borders of that country ended. From this place, they saw mountains twelve to thirteen ri to the southwest. Upon crossing, there was another country, which is called "Kunashiri" (Kunashir). Again following the coast southwest for nine days and nights, the territorial boundary ended. Again they saw mountains over twenty ri to the west. Upon crossing, it was "Nossapu" of Ezo. From there, passing through "Togachi" of the same country, they reached Matsumae, according to the record.

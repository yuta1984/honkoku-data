In order to show the geographical situation of the adjacent countries of Korea, Ryukyu, Ezo, as well as Ogasawara Island, together with Karafuto, Rakko Island, Kamchatka, and several other countries, I have separately created a small map of these several countries on one sheet, combining it with the four maps to make five maps in total. By viewing this small map, one should understand the directions of the adjacent territories.

Total: Five maps

This map depicts the seas and lands of Korea, Ryukyu Kingdom, Ezo (Hokkaido), the Uninhabited Islands, and others, arranged according to celestial divisions with distances measured in ri. It uses color coding to distinguish landmarks including mountains, rivers, castle towns, villages, historical sites, famous places, ports, and post stations. Furthermore, it comprehensively illustrates the common scripts, tools and goods, customs of people, and the forms of birds and animals of these various countries. This can truly be called a rare treasure unprecedented in ancient and modern times. Completed on Rikka Day of the Tenmei Hinoe-uma year when the printing blocks were finished.

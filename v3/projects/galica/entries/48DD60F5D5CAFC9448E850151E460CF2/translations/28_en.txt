Our lives were preserved - this could truly be called divine assistance. In general, in snow country there is something called "nadare" (avalanche), and also something called "awa" (snow foam), which cause people to perish every year. "Awa" occurs frequently in winter, while "nadare" happens around the third and fourth months. "Awa" refers to when snow is falling most heavily - when a single bubble of snow falls from the treetops on the mountaintop, as that foam gradually rolls down, it gathers snow like scooping it up, progressively growing larger, and by the time it reaches the foot of the mountain, it becomes like a great mountain and crashes down. When this strikes, even large trees are uprooted, and if one has the misfortune to be passing by at such a time, neither people nor horses have time to escape.

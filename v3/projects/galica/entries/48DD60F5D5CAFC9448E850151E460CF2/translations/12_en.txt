There are characters, and at the top, the large character "East" is said to be carved. What might the content of that inscription be? Since the local people revere it and do not permit making stone rubbings of it, no one knows its content. In recent years, scholars with antiquarian interests have sought to make rubbings of this monument and transmit its contents, but since it is in an extremely remote location and few people travel there for pleasure, it has not yet become widely known in the world. I too have traveled through that region, but at that time bandit disturbances were frequent in that area, so I hurried through and did not reach that village, which I regret to this day. If the Taga Castle monument has the large character "West," there should logically be an eastern monument to correspond with it.

Also, in the Fubokushū, there is a poem by Kiyosuke Ason that begins "Ishibumi ya Tsukaro no ochi ni" (Stone monument at Tsukaro's settlement...)

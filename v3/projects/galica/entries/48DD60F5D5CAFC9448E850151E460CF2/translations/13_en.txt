"Do you hear of it? I cannot put the world out of my mind." Also, in Saigyō's *Sankashū* there are verses like "Michinoku seems so distant and alluring, the stone monument at Tsubo, the winds of Soto-ga-hama," and such—these too seem to refer to the eastern Tsubo monument.

　　Barbarian Territories
Since heaven and earth first opened, there has never been a time as peaceful as now. From Kikai and Yaku islands in the west to Soto-ga-hama in Ōshū in the east, there is no place where governmental authority does not reach. In ancient times, Yaku Island was called Yaku-no-kuni and seemed like a foreign country, and even Ōshū—half of it was Ezo territory, wasn't it? Even until recent times it was a dwelling place of the barbarian peoples.

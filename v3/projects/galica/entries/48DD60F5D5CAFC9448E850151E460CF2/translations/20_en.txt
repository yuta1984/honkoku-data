We fell and tumbled dozens of times. However, because the accumulated snow was extremely deep, even when falling into streams, our bodies never completely plunged through. Thus, through tremendous hardships, what should have been merely a two-ri journey took half a day, and we finally managed to reach Budō Station as evening fell. I truly regretted not having followed the old woman's advice to stay overnight in Shio-no-machi and hire a guide to come with us in the early morning when the snow was firm—then we would not have encountered such dangers. While regretting this, I was first relieved that we had arrived safely. As I bathed and warmed myself by the hearth to ward off the cold, I was startled to see blood flowing from my feet.

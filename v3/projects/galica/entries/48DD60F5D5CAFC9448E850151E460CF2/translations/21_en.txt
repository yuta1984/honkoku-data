Thinking back, when I repeatedly broke through the snow and fell in today, I must have been injured, but because of the cold, even my blood froze and did not flow, and I felt no pain. However, now that I have bathed and warmed myself by the fire, blood began to flow for the first time. The scars from those wounds remain black to this day. Now, reflecting deeply on this night, if today's journey was already like this, what greater hardships await tomorrow? The path ahead is even more severe—the Great Budō Pass, the foremost snowy region in the north. What difficulties might we encounter? I resolved that we must hire a guide early in the morning while the snow is frozen hard. On the 19th, before dawn had fully broken, we set out with our guide leading the way.

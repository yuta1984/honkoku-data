Fifth Month (May)
　Orange Blossoms (Tachibana)
The fragrant tachibana tree—
on this moonlit night, its scent
does not reach my face,
but does the cuckoo sing
in May?

　Water Rail (Kuina)
Tapping at the cypress door,
the water rail at dawn—
are there people here?
The lingering fragrance
of the twill-patterned eaves

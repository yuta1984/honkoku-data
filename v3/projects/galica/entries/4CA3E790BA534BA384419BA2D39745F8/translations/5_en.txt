Fourth Month (April)
　Deutzia (Unohana)
White as pure silk robes
said to be hung out to dry—
summer has come,
and on the hedgerows too
abundantly blooming
deutzia flowers

　Cuckoo (Hototogisu)
Cuckoo, grow accustomed
to crying in this village
of remembrance,
again in this time
of waiting for May
with its deutzia blossoms

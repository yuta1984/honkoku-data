In leisure time with nothing to do, one cannot remain truly at ease
Awakening from sleep, the sun through the eastern window is already red
Quietly observing all things, each naturally attains its proper way
The beautiful moods of the four seasons are shared with humanity
The Way connects beyond the formed world of heaven and earth
Thoughts enter into the midst of wind and clouds' transformations
Not corrupted by wealth and honor, finding joy in poverty and humble station
When a man reaches this state, this is what makes him truly heroic

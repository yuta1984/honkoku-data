Poem 18:
Even if Mount Tsukuba
stands as a married couple
side by side,
could it match
the peak of
a single lotus throne?

Poem 17:
Appreciating flowers
and pitying birds—
are such gatherings
of foolish writings
limited only
to spring?

Poem 17:
The wisdom
of viewing
ancient documents
of disordered ages
that have been cut down and fallen
in a quiet
window.

Poem 17:
Teaching to announce
the silk fabrics—
does one proceed?
The female bird
that was engaged
shows jealousy.

Poem 17 - Noda
The sadness Hakugin-sha
that even sorrow
becomes mere
human entertainment
until one abandons
the way of women.

Poem 16 - Bōoku
Do the fisher-folk who fish see hardship
of their own accord?
At Mushiake's
strait
where insects dwell in seaweed.

Poem 15 - Man'gin-sha
Unable to approach
even the foot
of Mount Fuji's peak,
do the five mountains
flee far away?

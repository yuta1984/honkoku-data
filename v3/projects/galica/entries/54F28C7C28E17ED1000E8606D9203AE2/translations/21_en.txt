On summer nights, let us not close the brushwood door and enjoy the cool - the tapping water rail makes my heart restless
　　　　　　Kakuga
Sitting at the veranda waiting for wind in my sleeves, the cool breeze - is this still a distant waterside before autumn?
　　　　　　Mineyori
Though it is summer, when I see the clear spring water that brings coldness to the fields, it appears to be drops from an ice house
　　　　　　Takimi
The darkening hands are troublesome, the young rice-planting maiden hosts the moon in her wet sleeves
Shigaraki　　　　Kachōya
Until someone asks if I heard the first song of the cuckoo, I had been feeling joyful
Chichibu　　　　Seiryo
In the evening cool, my heart floats even more like a boat, gazing at the flowers of the moon's katsura tree
Sano　　　　Shihō
Stop your singing voice for a while, cuckoo, and sing in the middle of the moon
Kari Valley　　　Naoharu
On this full moon night of the sixth month, will the palace people summon the small shell melons?
Noda　　　　Hakuginsha
In the joy of just one call from the cuckoo, I listened all night to the eight voices of other birds as well
　　　　　　Same
Having talked and spoken everything out, even the cuckoo's first song has become outdated to people
　　　　　　Same
The cuckoo whose first song I heard at Mount Izu has become a jewel within stone
Narita　　　　Hidemei
Though good things go unknown in this world, how wonderful is the voice of the cuckoo hidden beyond the clouds
Sendai　　　　Senryūtei
Not minding even torn clothes that stay, the tachibana orange - in the past even its fragrance did not arise
Samukawaguchi　　　Yakan
Appearing as frost placed between those walking shoulder to shoulder, the cool moon of Suminoe
Kan'onji　　　　Ensetsu

[Left Page]　　　　Twenty
The hill of comings and goings is overgrown with summer grass in name only, without even a path for wind to pass through
Wakayama　　　　Fusaya
When I awoke, the cuckoo could no longer be heard - it must have been the first song of tonight's dream path
Osaka　　　　Baikōen　
The swift current strikes the rocks, and night after night the waves appear as scattered jewels - flying fireflies!
〃　　　　　Harutomi
Even the evening bell sounds lonely, in the garden's leaf-cherry trees gaining color in the rain
〃　　　　　Takezai
Even friends to talk with don't visit, and horns seem to grow in my mouth - in this plum rain
Hyōko　　　　Shindō
Does the cherry wrapped in green leaves, if one speaks of its pathos, bloom even more gently?
Sakai　　　　Waginsha
The cuckoo I heard about yesterday through others - tonight I could gaze at the moon
〃　　　　　Shigeki
At Osaka barrier, what serves as the checkpoint for summer travelers is the clear water in the shade of cedar trees
Ōtsu　　　　Suzuo
The heat that everyone detests is placed above the wind - what a cool evening this is!
Shigaraki　　　Kachōya
Chased by an evening shower and fleeing, the amusing way my body's sweat gets wet from the inside first
Chōhachi-ichi　　　Ritō
The warbler's voice has also ceased with summer's coming - are these not just days that don't leak through the young leaves?
Tsu　　　　　Tsuhame
Wishing to extinguish the hot things criticized by chopsticks, the wind's lamp flame would probably turn away
〃　　　　　Hajimaru
The cherry blossoms have all scattered - cry sadly, cuckoo of great Mount Hiei
Chikoya　　　Ben'ben-kyo
In the darkness of May, like something slipping through the mesh of nets that catch birds in the clouds' web - one voice!
　　　　　　Tokiyoshi

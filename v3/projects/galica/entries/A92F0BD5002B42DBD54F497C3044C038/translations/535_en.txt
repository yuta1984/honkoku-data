Sanjō Dainagon Kimishige was appointed to Naidaijin. In the ninth month, Retired Emperor Fushimi passed away at the age of fifty-three.

In the second year, second month, His Majesty (Emperor Hanazono) abdicated the throne to Crown Prince Takaharu. Since His Majesty was twenty-two years old and the Crown Prince was already over thirty-two years old, it was said that Retired Emperor Go-Uda and others of that faction had been waiting impatiently, so the Kantō (Kamakura Shogunate) arranged for this [abdication]. The era names were Enkyō three years, Ōchō one year, Shōwa five years, and Bunpō two years, totaling eleven years of reign.

In the fifth month of the second year, Middle Counselor Hino Suketomo and Minor Controller of the Right Hino Toshimoto were arrested and sent to Kamakura. These two men were close retainers of the Emperor and had been plotting to destroy the Kantō (Kamakura shogunate). In the tenth month, Major Counselor Banri-kōji Nobufusa was dispatched to Kamakura, where he presented explanations to Hōjō Takatoki and made apologies. As a result, Suketomo was exiled to Sado, and Toshimoto was pardoned and returned to the capital. The court was safe. In the eighth month, the Zen monk Musō Soseki was made abbot of Nanzen-ji temple. From this time, the Emperor became inclined toward Zen Buddhism. In the tenth month, former Shogun Prince Koreyasu passed away at the age of sixty-two. In the twelfth month, former regent Ichijō Tsunetsune passed away at the age of thirty-six. Crown Prince Kuniyoshi passed away at the age of twenty-four. In the same month, Hōjō Takatoki, due to illness, shaved his head and took the Buddhist name Sūkan at the age of twenty-four. He transferred the position of shikken (regent) to his younger brother Yasumura, who held the title of Major of the Left Palace Guards, with Kanazawa Sadaaki serving as rensho (co-signatory).

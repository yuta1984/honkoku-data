[Emperor Juntoku] passed away in Sado (aged 46). In the tenth month, the title of Empress was posthumously granted to his mother Tsūko, and Left Minister with Senior First Rank was posthumously granted to his maternal grandfather Tsunemune. In the twelfth month, former Regent Konoe no Iezane passed away (aged 64).

In the first year of Kangen, sixth month, a prince was born to the Empress, and the ceremonies during the seven nights were conducted with the utmost solemnity. The enthroned Emperor administered court politics together with the Crown Prince, and among the court officials, those who had achieved prominence mostly built mountain villas in Kitayama, where they constructed artificial hills, gathered various trees and stones, dug ponds, built pavilions, and enjoyed themselves. They also built the Saionji temple hall and constructed temple buildings alongside it. This rivaled even the temple hall of Dōchō's Hōjōji, and its magnificence was even greater. The Emperor's elder brother of the same mother, Hōshin Prince Ninjō of Enman'in, was naturally intelligent and was on intimate terms with the Emperor.

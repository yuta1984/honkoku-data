In the first month of the third year, Konoe Dainagon Iehira was appointed Naidaijin. Around this time, two men, Hōjō Morotoki and Hōjō Tokimura, served as regents as Sadatoki's representatives. Hōjō Munekata was Tokiyori's grandson. He争ed for power with Morotoki. However, since Tokimura was also close to Morotoki, their faction was strong. Therefore, thinking to kill Tokimura first and then plot against Morotoki afterward, he secretly claimed it was by order of Shōgun Hisaaki, gathered troops, and attacked and killed Tokimura in a night raid. Tokimura was sixty-four years old at the time. Sadatoki was angered and dispatched Hōjō Munenori and Utsunomiya Sadatsuna to kill Munekata. All of his associates were also killed. He had Munenori assist Morotoki as co-regent. In the fourth month, Nijō Kaneki resigned as regent, and Kujō Sadaijin Moronori became regent and resigned as Sadaijin. In the fifth month, Retired Emperor Kameyama passed away at the age of fifty-seven. At the time of the funeral procession, Retired Emperor Go-Uda attended as an escort, and many court nobles and courtiers followed in attendance. This retired emperor was thirteen years old at the beginning of his reign.

mother, so she was the emperor's great-grandmother.

In the second year, third month, there was a council meeting about Shogun Prince Munetaka's planned return to the capital the following year, and notices were sent to warriors throughout the provinces, but the matter was cancelled.

In the first year of Shōgen, spring, many people died from epidemic and famine. There was a young nun of about fourteen or fifteen years old who ate the dead bodies in the capital, but after a month her whereabouts became unknown. In the third month, the Empress Dowager Ōmiya-in, the emperor's mother, held a complete sutra offering ceremony at Saionji in front of the flowers, with imperial visits. The day after the offering ceremony there was imperial entertainment, and the emperor played the biwa. In the fifth month, former Kanpaku Kanetsune died at the age of fifty. He was called the Okaya Kanpaku. In the eleventh month, the emperor abdicated his throne to his younger brother Tsunehito. Since he was only seventeen years old this year, it was probably not his own wish but the arrangement of the retired emperor. The era names were Kanji 2, Kenchō 7, Kōgen 1, Shōka 2, and Shōgen 1, totaling thirteen years of reign.

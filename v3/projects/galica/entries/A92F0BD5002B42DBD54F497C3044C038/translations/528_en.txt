Michihira was appointed Naidaijin.

In the second year, in the second month, Chūnagon Taira no Tsunechika went down to Kamakura as an imperial envoy. He returned to the capital in the third month. In the seventh month, the Emperor's mother Yūgimon'in passed away at the age of thirty-eight. As she was the most beloved consort of Retired Emperor Go-Uda, he could not bear his grief and took the tonsure, becoming a Cloistered Emperor. He was forty years old at the time. From then on, he received instruction in Shingon esoteric teachings, abstained from women, built Saga Daikakuji Temple, and followed in the footsteps of Emperor Uda (the Kanpyō Emperor). According to one theory, he shaved his head in the year following Yūgimon'in's death. In the eighth month, Hōjō Tokinori died at Rokuhara. Hōjō Sadafusa came to the capital as his replacement.

In the third year, in the seventh month, through Hōjō Sadatoki's arrangements, Shōgun Prince Hisaaki returned to the capital. From the second year of Shōō until this year, he held the position for twenty years, but was merely a nominal military leader, with all matters great and small being controlled by the Hōjō clan.

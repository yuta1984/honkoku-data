The emperor greatly abhorred her sin and said, "If I were placed in your position, not only would my treatment be the same, but perhaps if it were me, killing one woman would still not suffice to vent my anger, and I would likely have condemned thousands more to punishment. Your misfortune is truly extraordinary. Probably such a strange calamity will never occur again in this world. Your action has already sufficed to appease the wrath of the gods, but that your grief does not cease is naturally reasonable."

They set sail and after about a month had passed, without any disasters from rough waves or violent storms, they reached their destination port. In this trading venture, all three brothers gained profit, and especially the old man profited greatly, exchanging one for ten. Having already completed their trading and preparing to depart, they left the market and hurried toward the wharf. When they arrived at the seashore, there was a voice from behind that seemed to be calling the old man, so he turned his head to look and saw it was a woman of the lowest and most humble status. As for her appearance, her hair was disheveled and her clothes were torn, presenting a most pitiful sight. However, as she approached and he looked more carefully, her natural beauty could not be hidden or concealed even by rags, her eyebrows and eyes were like a painting, making him wonder if she might be a celestial being.

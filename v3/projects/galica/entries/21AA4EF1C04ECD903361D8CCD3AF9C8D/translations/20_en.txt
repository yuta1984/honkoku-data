"I have already been able to hear the origins of your grief. I wish you would tell me the circumstances by which you obtained joy today," he pressed repeatedly. However, seeing that the younger brother king attempted to make various excuses, the emperor pressed him even more persistently with questions and would not stop. Therefore, the younger brother king had no choice but to report exactly what he had witnessed of the empress's infidelity. Emperor Sukariya was greatly shocked, but still harbored doubts and desired to see it with his own eyes. So the younger brother king offered a stratagem: "Let Your Majesty go hunting again, return alone in secret, and enter your younger brother's palace. Then you will surely believe your younger brother's words." The emperor followed this advice and immediately ordered another hunt and departed incognito.

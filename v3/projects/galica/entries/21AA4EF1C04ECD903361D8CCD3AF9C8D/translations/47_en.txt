After he departed, only the emperor and the princess remained. At that time, when the emperor removed the veil covering the princess's face, he was first struck by her beauty, and then seeing traces of tears, he wondered and asked, "You have already willingly married me of your own accord, so why do you grieve your heart so much?" Scheherazade replied, "My grief is not for myself. I have one sister whom I love dearly, and I am saddened by the thought that I will never be able to see her again. Please show great mercy - since it is only for this one night, would you kindly allow her to share the same room and sleep here, and permit us this final meeting?" she pleaded sorrowfully.

when asked about your labors, you merely carry your master from time to time for leisurely walks. My situation is completely opposite to yours—the farmhands drive me all day long to plow the fields, sweat drips down to moisten the soil below, and I pant as if about to breathe fire. When my pulling strength weakens even slightly from such suffering, there are immediately shouts from behind and the thorn-whip strikes my rump at once. Look at this—from the weight of the plow and the intensity of the work, my back is rubbed raw with no unmarked place remaining. Thus every day I leave the pen before sunrise and return to the pen after sunset, yet the filthiness and foulness of my food is beyond description.

On the eighth day of the first month, by imperial decree, the people throughout the country were ordered to draw images of the Five Great Power (Bodhisattvas), and the Ninnō (Benevolent Kings Sutra) rituals were established with ceremonial offerings. {{Marginal note: The demons and spirits became frightened and left the country's borders}}

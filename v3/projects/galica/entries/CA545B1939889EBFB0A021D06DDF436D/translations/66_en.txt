Kongōkū (Diamond Roar) Bodhisattva

Chintaku Fudō Myōō (House-Protecting Immovable Wisdom King)
- The Fudō Sutra states: "The Holy Immovable Great威怒 King compassionately thinks of all sentient beings with extremely great mercy. His true form is Vairocana Buddha."

Aizen Myōō (Love-Tinted Wisdom King)  
- The Kongō Sutra states: "His body dwells in the blazing wheel like the sun, with three eyes glaring wrathfully, his hair bound up in a topknot wearing a lion crown, with bristling hair in a furious form. He also has five-colored flower garlands hanging down, covered with celestial sashes. On the leaping lion's crown hang five-colored flower garlands covered with celestial sashes. In his left hand he holds a golden bell, in his right hand he takes a five-peaked vajra. Next, he takes a diamond bow in his left and diamond arrows in his right, shooting like the light of many stars."

Ryōtō Aizen Myōō (Two-Headed Love-Tinted Wisdom King)
- "He accomplishes the great tinting dharma, and with the force of striking the lotus on the right, he swiftly destroys evil-hearted sentient beings. Below the lotus is a treasure vase that spits out various treasures from both sides."

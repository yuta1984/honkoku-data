Eastern Gōzanze Myōō (Conqueror of the Three Worlds Wisdom King)
- His original ground (honji) is Yakushi Buddha (Medicine Buddha). The so-called "three worlds" refers to conquering greed, anger, and ignorance, and these three poisons are called Gōzanze. What he tramples with his left foot represents Maheśvara (Śiva), symbolizing the severing of afflictive hindrances (kleśa-āvaraṇa). What he tramples with his right foot represents Umā-devī, symbolizing the severing of cognitive hindrances (jñeyāvaraṇa). Because afflictive hindrances are coarse, they are likened to the masculine and trampled forcefully, while cognitive hindrances are subtle, so they are likened to the feminine and trampled gently.

Western Daiitoku Myōō (Great Awesome Power Wisdom King)
- His original ground is Amida Buddha. The Blue Dragon Commentary states: "He crushes and subdues all poisonous evil dragons." The Luminous Commentary states: "Daiitoku means that his virtue surpasses all others, and he intimidates and strikes fear into the various dragons."

Buddha-Mother Great Peacock Wisdom King (Butsumo Daikujaku Myōō)
- The Peacock Sutra states: "Those who recite the divine mantra of the Peacock Wisdom King will have a lifespan of one hundred years, a longevity of one hundred autumns."

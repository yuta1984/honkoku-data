39 Please have a cup of tea.
40 This tea is delicious and has an excellent flavor.
41 I received it from a friend.
42 If you would like some of it, please tell me, and I will supply you with it.
43 I beg you to procure four or five catties (one catty equals 1¼ pounds).
44 Very well, I will not neglect it - I will procure it for you.
45 I am obliged to you.
46 At your service.
47 I believe you will soon prepare yourself for the voyage to Edo.
48 Yes, it is true. Don't hesitate to tell me if you would like to make contracts for any goods at Osaka, Miyako, or Edo.
49 I thank you for your kindness. I will give you a commission then.
50 What goods do you desire?
51 Really, I scarcely dare mention it to you, however I earnestly beg you to buy such and such goods for me at Osaka, and I will not fail to pay you upon your return.
52 I will not forget it.
53 I am very much obliged to you.

71 I believe you will also spend much money during the voyage
by going to taverns when not on duty,
and that you will enjoy yourself much with
the courtesans of the upper class and with
other women.

72 You are joking with me.
Though people say so, how can one amuse oneself
in that way during the voyage?
We don't have time every year to amuse
ourselves,
but are quite wearied by business; often we
must rise earlier and go to bed later.

73 Certainly that may be so.

74 What time is it now?

75 It is past seven o'clock by our time.

76 Past seven o'clock by our time is past four
o'clock by Dutch time, is it not so?

77 Yes, I have a Dutch watch.
By that I know very well that day and
night have twenty-four hours with the Dutch,
which with us are divided into twelve,
as you know.
Thus every hour is reduced by half,
and each one is counted as half an hour.
Thus six o'clock Dutch time corresponds with
our six o'clock.

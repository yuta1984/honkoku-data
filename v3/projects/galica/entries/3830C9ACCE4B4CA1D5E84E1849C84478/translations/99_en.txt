50 No, you need not go there yourself, but
let him know by a note.
51 Well, I will do as you wish.
52 Won't you drink one more cup?
53 No, I have drunk enough.
54 No thank you, the sake has heated me.
56 Can you not take supper after drinking?
57 I never take supper after drinking much.
58 It is not good for the stomach.
59 I believe it is time: I am going.
60 I am very happy to have conversed
so much with you today.
61 I thank you for your kind reception.
62 Please be so good as to come here early tomorrow
along with N.
63 I will. I wish you a good night.
64 And I too. Farewell.

Fourth Dialogue
with a friend after a long absence

1 I come to visit you.
2 Ha! Welcome, my good friend.
3 How do you do?
4 I am always well.
5 That is very fortunate.
6 Why have you not been to see me for so long a time?
7 I have been indisposed for a long while.
8 Really?
9 Yes, truly.
10 I was not informed of it, and that is the reason I did not
know it.

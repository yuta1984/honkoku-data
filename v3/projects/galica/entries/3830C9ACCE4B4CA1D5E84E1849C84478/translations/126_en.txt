rain came on.

84 Tomorrow you must go out early.
I beg you will pass the evening here.
What do you say of the New Year?
Almost all young and old people are merry
and amuse themselves much,
while the boys and girls are playing at
　　　the game of balls
　　　"　　"　　"　paper
　　　"　　"　　"　feathers
　　　"　　"　　"　cockleshells
　　　"　　"　　"　chests
and different other games.
Therefore you ought not to be in such
a hurry as at other times.
When it grows dark many ladies and
other women, nicely dressed, accom-
panied by a woman servant with some
small bundles of tea, and by a lantern bearer
go to and fro in the streets to pay
compliments to their acquaintances & relations.
Then they are plagued by the children,
who are very gay and merry from before
our five o'clock at night till four.
You will see them as you go home.
You know these things.

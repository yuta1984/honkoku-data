24 You speak truly.
25 I have learned that Mr. S(?) is a good master.

30 No, I believe there are people who cannot succeed, for the Dutch language is very difficult to learn.
31 That's certain, but through your application you will be able to achieve it.
32 I would willingly desire to learn as perfectly as possible.
33 You must not neglect it even though the time is short.
34 I will do as you say.

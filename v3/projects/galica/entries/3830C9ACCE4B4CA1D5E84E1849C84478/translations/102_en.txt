67 Two or three months.
68 That time will seem to me very long.
69 Will you go with me?
70 I would like to, but I cannot go.
71 Why not?
72 You know I cannot.
73 But tell me why.
74 I have no money.
75 Will you go if you have cash?
76 Yes, with all my heart.
77 I will then supply you with some.
78 I thank you, but it is too late.
79 That's true.
80 I wish you a good journey.
81 I am much obliged to you, farewell until I
come back.

Fifth Dialogue

to go to see the play

1 Is your master up yet?
2 No, he is still asleep.
3 Be so good as to wake him.
4 Very well.
5 You come so early.

7 It comes from having drunk too much last

8 With whom have you been drinking so much?
9 With N.
10 I come to speak with you.
11 About what?

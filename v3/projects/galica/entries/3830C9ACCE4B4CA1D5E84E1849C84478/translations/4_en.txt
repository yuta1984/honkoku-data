First Dialogue
between a mature man and an apprentice.

1 Why don't you come to see me anymore?
2 Since I spend my time studying.
3 It's good that it's study that prevents you from coming to see me for so long.
4 I am obliged to you for your company.
5 Who is your master, or what is your master's name?
6 My master is named T, but for some days I have promised my friends to gather together to teach you.
7 Is your master well informed about this?
8 Yes, he knows it well and rejoices in my diligence.
9 So do I. How many times do you gather per month?
10 Six times a month.
11 Do you always go to the same place, or does it change each time?
12 We gather sometimes at one person's house, sometimes at another's.
13 Who first began these meetings or assemblies?
14 N. began first.
15 At what time do you gather?
16 I go in the afternoon and stay until evening.
17 Do you go there directly after your studies?
18 Yes, I return home early because when it becomes too late my father scolds me.
19 Why is that?

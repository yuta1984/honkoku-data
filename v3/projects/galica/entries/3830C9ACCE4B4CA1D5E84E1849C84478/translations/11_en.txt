51 Very well, I shall do as you wish.
52 Won't you have another drink?
53 No, I have drunk enough.
54 Won't you have supper?
55 No, I am obliged to you, the sake makes me hot.
56 Can you not sup after drinking?
57 I never sup after having drunk much.
58 That is not good for the stomach.
59 I believe that is true: I am going.
60 I am very delighted to have conversed with you 
for so long today.
61 I am obliged to you for your good reception.
62 Please be so kind as to be at my house early tomorrow
with N.
63 Good, I wish you a good night.
64 The same to you, take care of yourself.

Fourth Dialogue
With a Friend One Has Not Seen for
A Long Time

1 I come to see you.
2 Ha! Welcome, my good friend.
3 How are you?
4 I am always well.
5 That is very fortunate.
6 Why have you not come to see me for
so long?
7 I have been ill for a long time.
8 Is that true?
9 Yes, truly.
10 No one told me anything about it, which is why I did not know.

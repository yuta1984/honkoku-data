19 Did you spend money on a fasimitye(?) for a young girl?
20 No, I only went there to take a walk.
21 You must have enjoyed yourself very much.
22 Yes, but I find myself a bit indisposed from drinking today.
23 I believe that.
24 Won't you accompany me today?
25 Where are you going?
26 To a house of rendezvous.
27 I would like to, but I'm engaged for today.
28 Then I'll order some solid food(?) for you.
29 I'm obliged to you, but today I'm staying at home.
30 Do you then place so little value on my friendship?
31 I don't refuse it, but I don't want to go out, in order to recover.
32 Then you wouldn't go out even if you were summoned to the Government?
33 You answer me sideways, since this has no relation to our duty.
34 It's only teasing, don't be angry about it.
35 No, I'm not angry.
36 Then I'll go with you another day.
37 Please do.
38 Farewell then, until we meet again.
39 I am your servant.

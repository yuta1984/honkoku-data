12 I cannot go to Woerakami with you today.
13 Why not?
14 Last night about twelve o'clock I received a note
from the rapporteur, and must go to
Decima today.
15 What for?
16 To fetch the goods from the storehouse.
17 Why then did you not inform me of it
last night?
18 Because it was too late.
19 Can you not request N to fill your place?
20 I can do so, but I will go there today myself
to transact my business.
21 You deceive me: I will put it off then for
another day.
22 You ought not to put it off because I cannot go with you.
23 That's true, but I prefer to go with you.
24 I too, but I cannot help it.
25 You never keep your word.
26 I will then go to him and beg him to fill
my place.
27 Please do so, but at what o'clock do you go to
Decima?
28 At ten o'clock.
29 It's still early.
30 I will soon be back.
31 Be so good then to make as much haste as
possible.
32 Very well, I will be back in a moment.

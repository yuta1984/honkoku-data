32 What is the reason why the Dutch who formerly traded at the Island of Hirado left that factory, and established themselves here?

33 I do not know the reason well, however I have been told it was because the town of Nagasaki is the principal of the Emperor's domains, and particularly because it was well situated for trade.

34 I understand it now: how many miles is Japan from Batavia?

35 About ---- miles.

36 I believe the Dutch in their voyage to Japan are often exposed to dangers.

37 It is as you observe, for some years ago, a ship, after suffering much in a storm, was thrown on the Island of Goto.

38 In what manner was the wreck dealt with?

39 It was hauled here from Goto, and was broken down here to be sold.

40 Of what use were the beams and planks?

41 They were employed in the construction of small sailing vessels.

42 I must go.

43 Chat a little, stay a little longer.

44 Time forces me to go.

45 Why?

46 I dine today with N.

47 Do you know him too?

48 Yes, I know him very well.

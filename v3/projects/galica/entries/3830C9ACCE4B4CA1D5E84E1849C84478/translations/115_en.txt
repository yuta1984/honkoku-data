8 What may be the purpose of it?

9 It is not so easy to say; the purpose will be a profound one.

10 Please be so good as to explain it to me. I will not speak of it to others.

11 If you wish it, I will tell you the purpose.

12 Yes, please do.

13 I will tell you. Pay attention.
It serves as an excellent lesson: you must rise early in the morning and light that candle at the fire, then you must not neglect to apply yourself with ardor to learning and writing.

14 It is true. I understand now what a good lesson it is.

15 You must learn perfectly, but this year you have written worse than the previous year.

16 Yes, I have lost my mind.
It is for that reason I did worse.
But if my madness increases thus,
soon again I will talk childishly.

17 It is but a joke; don't be angry. I have drunk a great deal—that is the reason why I am so talkative.

18 Where have you been?

19 I have been at the Governor's.

20 What for?

21 Mr. N. sent for me in order to tell me a story about Miyako (Kyoto).

22 Was it there that you drank so much?

23 Yes, after he told me his story, we were merry together.

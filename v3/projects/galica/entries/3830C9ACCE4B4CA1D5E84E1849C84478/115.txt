8 What may be the object of it?
9  't is not so easy to say, the object will b an abstruse
 one.
10 Be so good as【to削除なしがbetter】 explain it to me, I will not speak 
of it.
11 If you wish it I will tell you the object.
12 Well.
13   I will  tell it you【to youがbetter】, pay attention.
It   serves as an excellent lesson, you must  rise 
early in the morning and  light that candle  at
 the fire, then you must not neglect to apply
your self with ardour to learning and  writing.
14   't is true, I conceive now that it is such a good
 lesson.
15 You must learn  perfectly,  but this year you have
written worse than the former.
16 Yes I have lost my head.
't is for that I did worse
but if my madness increases thus
soon again I will talk childishly.
17 't is but a joke, do'nt be  angry, I have
drunk a great deal, 't is the reason why I am 
so loquacious.
18 Where have you been?
19 I have been at the Governors.
20 What to do?
21 Mr. N. has sent for me in order to tell me a story of
Miako's.
22 Was it there you have drunk so much?
23 Yes, after he told me his story we were
merry together.

71 I beleive【believe】you  also will spend much money on
the voyage
by going, when not on service, to the tavern
and that you will amuse your self much with
the  Taju/girls of the upper class/and with 
other girls.
72 You are joking with me.
Though they say so,  how can one amuse himsef
in that way during the voyage?
We have not every year the time to amuse
ourselves
 but are quite wearied by  business, often we
must rise earlier and go later to ed.
73  Certainly that may be.
74 What    o clock is it at present.
75 It is past seven o clock with us.
76 Past seven o clock with us, is past four o
clock with the Dutch, is it not so?
77 Yes: I have a Dutch watch.
By that I know very well that  day and
night have twenty four hours with the Dutch,
which with us are divided by twelve
as you know.
Thus every hour is diminish'd by the half
and every one is counted for half an hour.
Thus six o clock with the Dutch agrees with
our six o clock.

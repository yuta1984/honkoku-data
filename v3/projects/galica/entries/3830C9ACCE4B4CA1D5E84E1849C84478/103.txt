12 I can not go to day【today】 with you to Woerakami.
13 Why so?
14 Last night about twelve o clock I  have got a note
from the  rapporteur, and  must to to day to
Decima.
15 What to do?
16 To fetch the stuff goods from the storehouse.
17 Why then have you not informed me of it
last night.
18 Because it was too late.
19 Can  you not request N to fill your place?
20  I can do so, but will go thither to day myself
to transact my business.
21 You deceive me : I will  put it off then for
another day.
22 You ought not to put it off  because I can not go with you.
23 T'is true, but I  prefer to go with you.
24 I too, but I can not help it.
25 You never keep your word.
26  I will then go to him and beg him to fill
my place.
27 Pray do so, but at what o cloc do you go to
Decima?
28 At ten o clock.
29 T'is still early.
30 I will  soon be back.
31 Be so good then  to make as much haste as
possible.
32  Very well, I will be back in a moment.

8  Who ord'red so?
9 The Governor has given  these orders to the
maoyor.
10 Why?
11  Do'nt you know it yet?
12  No, I have not heard it.
13 It is on account of a  quarrel.
14 Where did it happened【happen】?
15 It happened in the street Jemafakata.
16 Who were the parties?
17 In the beginning  two children were
boxing, afterwards both their fathers
had recourse to   the sword,by which
 both are severely wounded.
18 I think a severe punishment awaits them.
19 All the officers of the guard having
 heard of  it
instantly flocked thither  to put a stop to it, and
have since made their  reports at the gover-
nor's
20 What orders has the Governor given about those
quarrelers.
21 He has ordered nothing yet as they are both
too much wounded.
22 It has been a severe battle.
23 I think there are amongst the common people many who are
 too passionate.
24 It is true, such quarrels often happen among them.

3 Why so?
4 Because I am feasting day and night.
5 It is so, we pass the first month entirely
in  drinking and amusing ourselves.
6 The fifteenth of this month I  was
treated by N.
7 On what occasion did he  entertain you?
8  He has treated us the day on which the
voyage to Jedo was to have been begun to consol■
for  not having made the voyage.【丁寧すぎて文法がややこしい！】
9 How many were you?
10 Near forty.
11 Ha, he  has a large company.
12 I think Mr. F.(?) will be displeased with it.
13 What have you done amiss.
14 I did no harm.
15 Why then? 
16 I have till last night  been composing for him some dialogues
 in dutch and Japanese
but have not  composed any yet during
this month.
17 Why then  are you not busy about it at
present.
18 Because I have no  time, as I  told you
just now.
19  You must  do it to day: even if you had
no time for it.
20 You are, t'is  for that I was writing a little
before you arrived.

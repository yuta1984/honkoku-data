yourself to it when young.
22  I think so too, on account of that I must
study constantly.
23  In behaving thus your father will be easy ■【toヵ】
have you not heard any news at your meeting.
24 Yes, I have heard some news, but will tell  ■
you another time,  because I have spent my 
time in talking.
25 Do you go away then?
 26 Yes, I go.
27 May a little.
28 No, in a few days I will come back to see you.
29  Farewell then till your return.
30 I am your servant.
31 And I, yours.

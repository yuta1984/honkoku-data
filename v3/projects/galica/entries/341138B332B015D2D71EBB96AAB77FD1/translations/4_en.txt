It's completely
impossible, so let's die
and be together
in the afterlife -
I thought about this desperately,
but rather than
an unknown future,
if we endure living
in this painful, sorrowful world,
someday we might
be able to
be together.
When I thought this way,
dying gradually became
distasteful
to me.
Come now, don't
complain.
How frustrating.

You look like
the Jihei
of old times.
Let's stop
this crude talk
of double suicide.
Let's live
for a thousand years
and enjoy ourselves.
What a
refined
way of thinking.

Does a demon
dwell in
my wife's
bosom?
I completely
hate sleeping
at home.
If the love
between you
and me
flows into the
Shijimi River,
surely even
Ariwara no Narihira
would be able to make
many large
freshwater clams.

This was because he feared the troubles of thieves. However, saying that what was now stolen was his own negligence, when he saw Tokijirō's letter that had been dropped, he thought, "So this must be the work of that girl's secret lover," and severely interrogated his daughter and the wet nurse. Unable to conceal anything further, they told the whole truth. Suigetsu became greatly enraged, saying "That hateful old man's scheme!" and went to the rental room across the way, bringing Kanai's servant to retrieve the mirror from the house opposite.

At Tokijirō's place, though there had been a promise to meet secretly tonight, he had been badly affected by the heavy snow since evening and was suffering, even having nosebleeds. His servant Somegorō had gone to the doctor's and was away. Afterward, while Tokijirō alone was suffering from illness, servants from Matsuya Suigetsu's house came, each carrying six-foot staffs, shouting "You thief! Strike him down and tie him up!" and immediately attacked.

Though the sick and exhausted Tokijirō's body was not functioning properly, with his practiced skills, he threw them left and right with both hands. Frightened by this prowess, wondering how they could capture him, they merely made a commotion, saying things like "If he has a sword at his side, we cannot easily approach him."

At this moment, an official from the district magistrate's night patrol happened to pass by, and hearing the shouting about a thief, entered with his jutte and rope to make an arrest. When Tokijirō saw the official, he offered no resistance and meekly submitted to being bound.

At this time, Matsuya Suigetsu knelt before the official and gave a detailed account of the circumstances. When the official questioned the bound Tokijirō, he explained how tonight he had been affected by the snow, was suffering from illness, and had neglected his secret meeting promise. While he was speaking, his servant Somegorō returned from the doctor's with medicine, saw this situation with surprise, and without any falsehood, told of tonight's illness.

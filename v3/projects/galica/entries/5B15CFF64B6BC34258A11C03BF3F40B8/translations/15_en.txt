Once your illness is completely cured, you shall investigate your family's treasure, take your enemy's head, and return triumphantly to your home province when the time comes. Your fortune will bloom like those plum blossoms—now is the time! Oh, there's that cough again. Please take your medicine. Come now, let me pat your back."

【In square frame】Conversation from the parlor across the way:
"Now Urasato-sama, even though you and your master have come to this rental parlor for convalescence, your illness only seems to worsen. This master here is known throughout Sakai in Izumi Province—no one doesn't know Matsuya Suigetsu, the renowned appraiser of tea implements. During tea house gatherings, he is frequently summoned to Higashiyama-sama's residence and compounds excellent medicines, yet even when he presents them to you, they show no effect whatsoever. Could this perhaps be some kind of lovesickness? No, well, the koto songs you practice are melodies of the boudoir that envy the pillow of unrequited love. Your deep affection for your beloved lord. That you should have feelings for a lord is not unreasonable for a sixteen-year-old maiden in full bloom. Having lost your mother at an early age and been raised from infancy by this wet nurse—when she acts with reserve, you scold her saying 'don't be so distant,' and the embarrassment that appears in a young girl's heart【Mark △ containing ▼】

【Mark △ containing ▼】The shame she barely contains, the wet nurse draws near and says: "Last spring, a lord called Itahachi-sama, a dealer in tea implements from distant Kamakura in the east, came to visit our inn, having heard of our establishment during his journey to the capital. Your father entertained him with his prized thin tea service. Impressed by this lord's fine demeanor as a guest, you fell deeply in love. Your heart boiled like a cauldron, unable to express the complex feelings of this double affection. While harboring these thoughts, he departed for the east, and this became your chronic ailment. Coming to this rental parlor for convalescence, from dawn to dusk you cannot forget Itahachi-sama, and that samurai gentleman in the parlor across the way is the very image of him【"Next" enclosed in square frame】

"I want to meet him, but I am too embarrassed to do so."

"What I saw was surely not just my imagination. Yes, yes, that very embarrassment of yours! Come now, you need not be reserved with me!"

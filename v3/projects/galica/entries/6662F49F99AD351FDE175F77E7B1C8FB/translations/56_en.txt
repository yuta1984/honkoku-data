Entrusting to the heart of the pond where the turtle dwells
Make a pact for your lifespan of ten thousand generations

The turtle too, looking up to your lifespan, from this year
　　　　　　　　　　　　onward
Together making a pact, may ten thousand generations pass

Together with the lifespan of the turtle with whom the pact was made
May your thousand years also pass through ten thousand generations

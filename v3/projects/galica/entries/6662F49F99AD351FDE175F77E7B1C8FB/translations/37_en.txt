For ten thousand generations, with refreshed spirit by the pond's edge,
The turtle that plays shall be your friend　Naoharu

The turtle that dwells on the boundless Isle of Hōrai,
I shall regard as a friend who should multiply for ten thousand generations　Aritai

In the mirror of the turtle we regard as friend,
The garden pond water reflects the image of ten thousand generations　Tadanobu

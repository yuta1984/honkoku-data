The turtle that has become accustomed to dwelling in the honorable pond as a friend through dawn and dusk,
Its lifespan shall endure for ten thousand generations　Shigeki

Flourishing in this honorable pond where water accumulates,
The turtle that becomes your friend for ten thousand ages

Pledging ten thousand generations to you, in the imperial garden's
Honorable pond, how familiar and playful this turtle is!

The limitless, unchanging lifespan of the turtle—
I shall pledge it to you for ten thousand generations of spring - Nobuyuki

The turtle dwelling in the green pond of the imperial garden
Should know of your lifespan's ten thousand generations - Eishin

The turtle living in the lush green of the pond's edge
Is the friend of ten thousand generations that you should behold - Kyū

○The azure-winged magpie (onagadori) has an entirely black body with a long tail. It is also called the Queen Mother bird (ōbo-chō).

○The sparrow (suzume) has a head like a garlic bulb and eyes like peppercorns. Its nature is extremely lascivious. When consumed, it invigorates yang energy, increases vitality, warms the lower back and knees, stops frequent urination, and treats uterine bleeding and vaginal discharge. The head should not be eaten as it causes sores to break out.

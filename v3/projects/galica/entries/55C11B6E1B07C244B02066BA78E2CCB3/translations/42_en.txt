○The varied tit (yamagara) is about the size of a sparrow. Its head is black, its back is black, and its belly is persimmon-colored. Because it handles its wings lightly and tames well, it is suitable for keeping in a cage.

○The coal tit (higara) resembles the great tit but is smaller. This one is also good for keeping as a pet. Its feather colors are beautiful.

○The marsh tit (kogara) resembles the coal tit but is extremely small. All of these migrate at the end of autumn.

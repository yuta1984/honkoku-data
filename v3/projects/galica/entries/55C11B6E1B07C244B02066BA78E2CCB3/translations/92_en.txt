○Nandina (nanten) blooms with small white flowers in May, bears fruit, and turns red after frost falls. The color is beautiful. This tree is believed to make bad dreams disappear when one looks at it after having a nightmare, so it is commonly planted facing washbasins at shrines and temples.

○Camellia (sansa) has many varieties. It is commonly called sazanka. It blooms in winter with light red or white flowers. Tsubaki blooms in spring, with both flowers and leaves being large and coming in various colors.

○Cherry (sakura) is also called shutō or bakuei. In ancient times, "flower" (hana) referred specifically to plum blossoms, but now when one says "flower," it refers specifically to cherry blossoms. The fruit is called ōtō (cherry). Originally, cherry blossoms were single-petaled, but later many varieties of double-flowered cherry developed, and now there are about one hundred varieties.

○Flowering crabapple (kaidō) has white flowers with red parts and is most beautiful. The leaves resemble those of a pear tree, and it blooms in March. It is also called kaikōka.

○The shamisen (three-stringed instrument) is originally a musical instrument from the Ryukyu Kingdom. It is also written as "samisen." In recent times, this shamisen is played throughout all provinces. Although it produces sensual sounds, it is an instrument with great freedom in tuning. Therefore, for the enjoyment of snow, moon, and flowers, as well as other entertainments, playing a piece on the shamisen is considered essential. Also, the kokyū (bowed string instrument) was likely created based on the shamisen.

○Theater (shibai) originated from performing kyōgen on grass by the riverbank, using straw mats as floor covering. It was originally similar to present-day street performers (hōkashi), but gradually became more refined. Costumes and props were made increasingly beautiful, and roles were divided into leading men (tachiyaku), female impersonators (onnagata), and villains (tekiyaku). In the three designated ports, permanent theaters were permitted, becoming places of entertainment for the people. Thus they came to be called "shibai" (theater).

○Celestial beings (tennin) have flower ornaments (keman) on their heads that never wither, their feathered robes never become soiled, and they never blink. However, when their lives end, their pleasures are exhausted and they experience the five signs of decay and sorrow.

○The Kalavinka is a celestial bird. It has a face like that of a celestial being, and its voice is exceptionally beautiful, hence it is also called the "wonderful voice bird" or "good sound bird." This is according to Buddhist scripture.

○Waka poetry is a custom of this country, arranging thirty-one syllables of kana, using the heart as seed to express emotions, based on truth. Therefore, poetry has such virtue that even buddhas and gods respond to it. While waka is said to have begun in the age of the gods, we revere Sumiyoshi Daimyojin as the deity of poetry, and regard Sotoori-hime, Hitomaro, and Akahito as the ancestral deities of poetry. Later, there were many poets such as Shunzei, Teika, and Ienao, and many excellent poems.

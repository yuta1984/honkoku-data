○Poetry originated from China, hence it is called "Tang poetry" (Chinese poetry). Poetry has six principles like waka. There are five-character and seven-character forms, composed of five or seven characters respectively, with "zekku" (quatrains) and "ritsu" (regulated verse). The ability to well express emotions, move people's hearts, and reveal truth is limited to these two forms: poetry and song.

Bai Juyi, courtesy name Letian, was a poet of the late Tang period.
Su Shi, courtesy name Zizhan, styled himself Dongpo. He was a person of the Song dynasty.

○The way of the brush (calligraphy) uses Chinese characters, called kanji. Wang Xizhi of the Jin dynasty is considered the founder of brush technique. It is said that when he wrote on stone, the ink penetrated about one inch into the stone.

In Japan, Emperor Saga, Kobo Daishi, and Tachibana no Hayanari are called the "Three Brushes" (Sanpitsu). Dofu, Sari, and Kosei are called the "Three Traces" (Sanseki). All of them left their honor in the way of the brush to posterity, and their calligraphy is revered. Prince Son'en's calligraphy is called the "Imperial House Style" and is practiced and used in the present world.

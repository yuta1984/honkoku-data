○Puppet theater (ningyō shibai) is also known as "ayatsuri" (manipulation). Initially, puppets were operated by suspending them with strings, but skilled practitioners emerged and now they can move freely, appearing as if alive. The Takemoto-za and Toyotake-za theaters in Naniwa (Osaka) serve as the foundation, with many skilled puppeteers. There is also the Takeda-za in Naniwa, which features karakuri mechanical puppets, creating such remarkable craftsmanship that it amazes spectators.

○Acrobatics (karuwaza) may have ancient traditions, though its origins are unknown. These are truly dangerous performances, but through balance and skilled technique, many expert performers have emerged to delight audiences. However, there are those who sometimes suffer injuries or accidents. Since a performer called Kirin-dayū began walking on a single rope, all acrobats have come to be called "kirin" by the general public. One would need to become accustomed to this art from childhood, as it would be difficult to master otherwise.

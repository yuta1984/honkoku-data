○Various etiquette forms are essential in human social interactions - one cannot do without proper etiquette. The six arts taught by the sages are: ritual (rei), music (gaku), archery (sha), charioteering (gyo), writing (sho), and mathematics (suu). Among these, ritual is especially valued. The etiquette and manners of this country are said to have begun during the reign of Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu.

○Swordsmanship is the method of sword fighting. It is also called military strategy (heihō). It is the foremost way of the warrior. There are many schools: Shintō-ryū, Yagyū-ryū, Shinkage-ryū, Ittō-ryū, and various others. However, there are often many people who rely on immature skills and do not know the danger to their own lives. Is this not lamentable? In today's peaceful reign, it would be better for merchants, artisans, farmers, and others not to know such things.

○Go is said to have been created by the Duke of Zhou. It is said to have been transmitted when Minister Kibi entered Tang China. The 360 intersections represent the days of the year. The nine star points represent the nine luminaries. The black and white stones represent day and night.

○Shogi was created when Emperor Wu of Zhou commanded his retainer Wang Bao to make it. It was modeled after military formations. There are large shogi and medium shogi. What we play with today is called small shogi, which has been the custom from the beginning.

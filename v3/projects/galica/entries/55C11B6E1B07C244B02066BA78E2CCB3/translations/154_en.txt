○Manzairaku (celebratory dance) is performed at the beginning of the year, gathering together auspicious themes for celebration and dance. It is said to be an art form that has existed since ancient times. According to tradition, during the time of Prince Shōtoku, court caps (eboshi) and costumes were bestowed upon the performers, which is why they still wear eboshi and suō (plain court robes) today. Those who come to the capital (Kyoto) are farmers from Yamato Province, hence they are called "Yamato Manzai." It is also said that performers go to the Chūgoku region from Mino Province, and to the eastern provinces from Mikawa Province.

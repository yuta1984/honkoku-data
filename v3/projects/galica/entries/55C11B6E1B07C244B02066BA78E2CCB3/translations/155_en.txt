Now, regarding palace treasures, garments, and crowns, as well as animals, plants, flying creatures, and swimming creatures, and all manner of implements and utensils - if one attempts to describe their appearance through written characters alone, even with painstaking search and investigation, one can barely obtain a rough approximation. However, if one seeks this through illustrations, it becomes clear at a single glance, and understanding already exceeds half the task. Therefore, when ancient scholars engaged in learning, they invariably placed books on the right and diagrams on the left. The reason why diagrams and books are mentioned together has this long-standing tradition. The illustrated compendium (zui) authored by Master Tekisai likely also has its purpose in this regard. This book is not merely intended to instruct children and beginners. Even veteran scholars and learned elders can use it as a resource to broaden their understanding of investigating things and extending knowledge. That each household treasures it and people collect it truly has good reason.

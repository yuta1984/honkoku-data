○The koto (Japanese zither) was first created by Fuxi. There are fifty-string and twenty-five string versions. The instrument using the se (a type of zither) is called wagon. Also, the thirteen-string koto enjoyed by the world is called tsukushi-koto. There are many people skilled in musical pieces and melodies.

○Incense has the virtue of purity and cleanliness, and is burned before shrines and Buddhist altars to ward off impurity. Its fragrance reaches far distances. Kyara (aloeswood) sinks when put in water, hence it is called jinko (sinking incense). It comes from China.

○Kemari (kickball) originated in China during the time of Nüwa. A treacherous retainer named Chiyou plotted rebellion and it led to war, but Nüwa, though a female emperor, possessed such sacred virtue that all people submitted to her. She finally defeated and killed Chiyou, beheading him. The people hated Chiyou and kicked his head. This is said to be the beginning of kemari. The kemari court requires planting four trees: pine, maple, willow, and cherry. The Asukai family and Namba family are the noble houses of kemari. There is the Matsushita school among the shrine families of Kamigamo.

○The origins of Kyōgen are not clear. Its insertion between Noh acts is probably intended to change the mood and induce laughter. Like Noh, it has divisions into schools with slight differences. Also, within Kyōgen there are pieces that are considered secret transmissions.

○Jōruri began with Ono no Tsū. Tsū was a lady-in-waiting to Lord Nobunaga. She created the story of Princess Jōruri of Yahagi in Mikawa Province, and Iwafune Kengyō added the musical accompaniment, calling it Jōruri. Later, the two kengyō Takino and Sawatsuno performed the musical narrative accompanied by shamisen. From around the Keichō era, Jōruri performers began to receive honorary court titles, and many Jōruri performers emerged in Kyoto, Osaka, and Edo, creating various schools.

○Noh is an ancient art form, but its transmission is not certain. During the reign of Emperor Go-Komatsu, a person named Kan'ami Zeami served as a Noh performer for the Shogun's family and performed vigorously. Later, it split into Konparu, Hōshō, and Kongō, forming the four schools. The term "sarugaku" (monkey music) is said to derive from Sarutahiko. Utai (Noh chanting) is the foremost entertainment in Japan, encompassing everything from Shinto, Buddhism, love, impermanence, historical tales, to common proverbs.

○The flute, small drum, large drum, and taiko drum are called the four rhythms. The flute was created by Kyūchū during the time of Emperor Wu of Han. The drum was created by King Mu of Qin. The large drum represents yang and is associated with the lü pitch pipes, while the small drum represents yin and is associated with the lü pitch pipes. These are instruments of yin-yang harmony. The taiko drum was made from the skin of the mythical creature Kui, killed during the time of the Yellow Emperor. Alternatively, it is said that when the Yellow Emperor fought against Chiyou, the Dark Lady created drums from Kui-ox for the emperor.

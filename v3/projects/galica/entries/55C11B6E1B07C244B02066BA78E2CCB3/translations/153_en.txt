○The originator of hachi-tataki (bowl-beating) is the monk Kūya. He lives in Kūya-dō temple in Shimogyō and makes his living by carving tea whisks (chasen). From December 13th, he walks around selling them throughout the streets of Kyoto. People purchase large tea whisks for the New Year as auspicious items.

○Kashima no koto-fure (Kashima's announcements) refers to the annual spring practice where the Kashima Daimyōjin delivers divine oracles about the year's fortune and misfortune, people's well-being, and the good or bad harvest of the five grains, which are then announced throughout the various provinces.

○Monkey dancing (saru-mawashi) is said to be an ancient art. Those who currently come to Kyoto apparently come from around the Fushimi area. At the beginning of the year, they visit the imperial court as a felicitous custom and perform auspicious dances. Also, in rural areas where cattle and horses are kept, monkey performances are held during autumn harvest time for prayers. The reason for this is that monkeys are called "fathers of the mountain" and horses are called "children of the mountain," as recorded in a book called "Ainō-shō."

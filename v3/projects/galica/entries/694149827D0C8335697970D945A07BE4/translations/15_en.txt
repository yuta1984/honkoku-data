Just as a farmer who removes weeds will surely see good grain flourish, when a loyal retainer eliminates treacherous officials, the imperial way becomes pure. Looking back to the days of Jōhei and Tengyō in the past, when the eastern and western provinces were in turmoil, it has now been twenty-four years since loyal and wise retainers devoted themselves wholeheartedly to pacification. The four seas are at peace, with no weapons visible to the eye and no sound of war horses heard by the ear. The people are content and enjoy their occupations. However, recently Left Minister Minamoto no Takaakira had conceived a conspiracy, but through Mitsunaka Asomi's intervention it was quickly resolved. Due to his enormous merit, he was appointed Governor of Settsu, with an imperial edict stating that he should reside there permanently to protect the imperial palace and govern that province directly. Mitsunaka gained great honor and was exceedingly pleased, making preparations to depart for his fief of Settsu before long.

He was to depart for his new province. Thus this lord, in matters of military arts, as recorded in ancient texts, had mastered the military strategies of Sun Tzu and Wu Qi in his heart, was an expert in swordsmanship and archery on horseback, and was the foremost among the warrior families of his time. Moreover, he favored the way of waka poetry and composed excellent renowned poems. Now, Sumiyoshi Myōjin of Settsu Province is the deity who protects the way of poetry. He had long wished to make a pilgrimage there, but sometimes he was appointed Governor of Iyo, sometimes he became protector of the capital, and being separated by provinces, it would not be without impropriety to venture out on private pilgrimages, so he had refrained until now. But this time, fortunately becoming the governor of this province, the time had come when his long-cherished wish could be fulfilled all at once. Deeply rejoicing, he first made pilgrimage to Sumiyoshi Shisho Myōjin, praying first for long-lasting military fortune and prosperity of his descendants, second that although he had devoted his heart to the way of waka for several years, his talent was limited and he could not compose famous verses - he wished to be granted the ability to compose excellent poems that would remain for future generations, and third that although he had been granted this province and would descend there immediately, he had not yet found a suitable residence - he wished to be shown a place for permanent dwelling. With single-minded devotion and sincere heart, he offered three sacred horses and one treasured sword, and performed a seven-day religious retreat.

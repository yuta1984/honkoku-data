Formosan Tea

Formosan tea is the most important product of the island. It is distinguished into two qualities which are known under the names of Woolung-tea and Flower-tea. The first is a natural tea having a characteristic flavor and perfume; and the second is prepared by a special process. The leaves are aromatized by certain odoriferous flowers which thus give them an exquisite taste.

Formosan tea has such an agreeable flavor that it suffices to taste it after a single drop.

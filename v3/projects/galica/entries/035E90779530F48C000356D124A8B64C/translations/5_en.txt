Formosan tea must be infused in a porcelain or earthenware teapot so that its taste is not altered.

Formosan tea must be neither too strong nor too weak to offer the flavor that makes it so justly esteemed. To prepare it, pour boiling water into a teapot, immediately put on the lid, and serve after two or three minutes. One can add a small quantity of sugar or milk.

Formosan tea must be prepared in very clean vessels. Above all, one must avoid anything that is salty, rusty, or greasy; otherwise the taste is immediately altered.

Formosan tea loses its tonic qualities and perfume; therefore it must be kept either in a porcelain pot or in a very clean and hermetically sealed metal box so that humidity cannot penetrate.

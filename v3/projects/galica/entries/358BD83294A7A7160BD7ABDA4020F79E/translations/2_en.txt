Previously there was an illustrated book titled "Edo Sakura" (Cherry Blossoms of Edo) depicting the famous places of Great Edo. Now, continuing from that work, I intend to show you every corner of Musashino without omission, and I address people both near and far. Please take this illustrated book, which is drawn to make your heart feel as light as a butterfly just by looking at it, one volume at a time, and make it a souvenir for your home.

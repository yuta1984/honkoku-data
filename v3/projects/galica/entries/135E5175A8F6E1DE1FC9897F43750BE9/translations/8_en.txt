Even so, he felt reluctant to leave the temple, so he wrote a poem on a pillar of the temple building:

　　In what lifetime shall I compare this body to others
　　And seek the moon over the muddy inlet?

Having composed this poem, he departed from the mountain and wandered among the peaks. Sometimes he used grass as a pillow with dew as his bedding, and sometimes he sheltered from the wind between rocks, using moss robes as a mat. Throughout the night he chanted the Buddha's name, praying "Please welcome my young body as well to the same lotus pedestal" through continuous memorial prayers.

Thus even during prostrations he never forgot the Buddha's name. One time he visited the Great Buddha Hall in the capital of Nara, kept vigil before the Buddha, chanted sutras aloud throughout the night, and at dawn offered prayers saying "self and others are equal, all places are different" - which was most admirable. When the temple's head priest came out for morning prayers and saw Shinkai's condition, he felt great compassion and approached him, asking "Where do you come from? What kind of person are you?"

From then on, they built a humble hut of brushwood at the foot of this mountain and enshrined three Buddhist statues. The Kita no Kata climbed the peaks to gather firewood, while her lady-in-waiting descended to the valley to draw pure water for Buddhist offerings, which they presented to the Buddha. The smoke from incense offered continuously six times a day rose like mist on the peaks, and the light from their perpetual lamp illuminated like fireflies lighting up the valley at night. They simply spent their days and nights chanting Buddhist scriptures and reciting the nembutsu, praying "May Lord Jijū also share in the same lotus bond of enlightenment." How truly sacred this was!

How admirable indeed! One day, the daughter of the Minister of the Right of Nijō, returning from the Ōhara Festival in her palanquin with a large retinue of attendants, stopped by this hermitage. Upon observing the nuns' religious practices and their simple arrangements, she said, "No matter how I look at it, this must be someone of high station who has renounced the world. What admirable devotion!" She shed tears and composed:

Having abandoned the world at the moon's setting in these deep mountains,
How enviable is this dwelling in such a hermitage!

Kō (Armor)
Regarding armor, the "Shaku-mei" (Explaining Names) states that "it resembles things that have scales and shells." There are many different theories about who first created it.

According to the "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), in the eighth month of the eleventh year of Hōki during Emperor Kōnin's reign, an imperial edict stated "Now make armor from leather."

Commonly, armor is called "gusoku" (complete equipment). This is presumably a general term meaning that the six pieces are complete and sufficient.

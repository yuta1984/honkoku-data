Rokuro (potter's wheel/lathe)
Tamakushige, Hakone—
in these mountains there are
seven places where hot springs
emerge, called the
Seven Hot Springs. In these mountain
homes there are many who
engage in this
craft, and though we don't know
from what era
[unclear characters] began,
the craftswork they devised is extremely skillful.

Using Japanese pagoda tree, holly, plum, cherry,
and ancient cedar wood.
In Edo this is called Yumoto
craftswork, which is especially
praised. From writing implements and desk
ornaments to
kitchen utensils and household decorations,
there is nothing that cannot be made
according to one's preferences.
These craftsmen are called
　　hikimono-shi (turners/lathe workers)

Motoyui (Hair Cord)

The poem "If you love me, I won't even enter the bedroom, little purple one, even if frost settles on my hair cord"

was composed and appears in the Kokin-shū, and though it uses ancient words, the strong hair cords that are praised began around the Kanbun era. Paper twisted cords are made long and soaked in water, then twisted with a wheel.

Because the water is squeezed out strongly, it's called "shikoki motoyui" (strong-twisted hair cord). Also, "Bunshichi motoyui" is said to be the name of a type of paper, but the details are unclear.

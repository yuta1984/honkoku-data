In the spring of the 37th year of Emperor Ōjin's reign, Achi no Omi and Tsuka no Omi were sent to the Kingdom of Wu to seek skilled seamstresses. Four women came: Ehime, Otohime, Kurehatori, and Ayahatori. This was the beginning.

Kinran (gold brocade) and karaori (Chinese weaving) were first produced by the Nomoto family and a certain Tawaraya of Nishijin in Kyoto.

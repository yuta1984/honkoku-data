Inkstone (suzuri)
The Xijing Zaji states:
"The Son of Heaven uses jade to
make inkstones. Also, Tang people mostly
use tiles to make inkstones."

The Wuzazu says:
"The stone from Duanzhou is the finest. Those that
enhance ink to a purple color are worth
a thousand pieces of gold."

　　In the Tale of Genji:
"The princess gently drew
her inkstone closer and wrote
as if practicing calligraphy. 'Please write
on this. There are no writings
on the inkstone,' she said, offering paper."

On the stone inkstone I gazed upon,
　　nothing was written,
　even the brush's bamboo holder
　　　was not used

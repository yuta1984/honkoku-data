The koto of Japan is mentioned in the "Kyūji-ki" (Chronicle of Ancient Matters) as the heavenly imperial koto that the deity Ōanamuji-no-mikoto possessed. The wagon (Japanese koto) appears in the "Kakai-shō." It also originated from arranging six bows and plucking them to make sound, based on the ancient tale of the goddess Ame-no-Uzume arranging heavenly fragrant bows in a row and playing the strings.

It is also called the Tsukushi-goto. According to another theory, the thirteen strings derive from dividing the twenty-five strings in half as an abbreviation, combining twelve musical modes. The first string exists in name only and is not actually played. It is similarly called han-kin (half-koto). The Yatsuhashi school originated around the Kanbun era when a monk named Hōsui from Tsukushi transmitted the art to Kengyō Yatsuhashi. It is still called Tsukushi-kyoku (Tsukushi music) today.

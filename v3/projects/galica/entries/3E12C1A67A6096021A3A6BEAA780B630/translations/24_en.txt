Earthenware (kawarake)
In Higashiyama, Kyoto,
　in the village of
Gensō,
　many
who make this
　their profession
　　　reside there.
　This is considered the finest quality.
In Edo, it's Minowa
　the loneliness of the kana-sugi
　　the sound of the potter's wheel

Faintly, yet certainly
　though not quite
　　what one would call
　　　　　　pottery making,
in moderate sunlight
　following custom, standing peacefully,
with heat shimmer burning in the rain-brightened
　morning scene, the warbler's voice
　　among the supple bamboo
　　　enclosure fence,
　here and there in the rustic
　　dwelling, indeed
　　　somehow deep
　　　　　　melancholy prevails.

The Nihon Shoki records: "In the first year of Emperor Jinmu's reign, construction of the imperial residence at Kashihara Palace was begun. At this time, Ame-no-ma-hitotsu-no-mikoto was in charge of the craftsmen."

Zhuangzi says: "A man from Ying painted white clay on the tip of his nose, thin as a fly's wing. He had the master craftsman Shi cut it off. Wielding his hand axe like wind, he completely removed the white clay without injuring the nose."

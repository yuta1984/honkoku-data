Umbrella (karakasa)
The Bowu Zhi states that "Emperor Shenyuan of Wei
first made umbrellas"
　　　From the Kokin Wakashū
O retainers,
　　say "honorable umbrella"
　　　　The dew under the trees
in Miyagino
　exceeds
　　the rain

In the third year of Bunroku, a merchant from Sakai in Izumi Province
　named Naya Sukezaemon returned from Luzon.
　　At that time he presented umbrellas and candles,
　　　one thousand of each.
　　　　The umbrellas we use today
　　　　　are said to be these.

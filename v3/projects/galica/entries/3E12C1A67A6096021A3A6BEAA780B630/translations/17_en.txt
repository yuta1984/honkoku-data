Emperor Monmu
In the first year of Taihō
kemari (kickball) was first played
Continuing thereafter,
Retired Emperor Go-Toba
praised it
Lord Asukai Chūjō Masatsune
mastered this way
and his family became the hereditary masters of kemari
A branch family split off
to form the Namba house, and both families
became renowned throughout the world
From the Fuboku-shū by Jien:
"Beneath the blossoms, counting the sounds of the ball being kicked,
before they cease, rain begins to fall"

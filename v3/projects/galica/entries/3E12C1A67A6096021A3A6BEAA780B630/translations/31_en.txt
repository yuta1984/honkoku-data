Needle (hari)
The Shuowen states: "To bind cloth with a needle
is called sewing. That which
does the sewing is called a needle. In common usage it is
written as 針 (hari)."

　Also,
in our country, in the spring of the 14th year of Emperor Ōjin's reign, 
　　two
　　　　women were sent as tribute
　　　from the kingdom of Baekje.
Their skillful technique
　was extremely refined. This was the
　　beginning of needlework. The
place of manufacture is Kyoto,
　with Suirenya on Ane-koji street being
　　famous throughout the world. Fifty needles
　　　　are called one hiki (bundle).
When the Teiwō Seiki states that "Emperor Taihao established the nine needles,"
sewing needles also began from this time.

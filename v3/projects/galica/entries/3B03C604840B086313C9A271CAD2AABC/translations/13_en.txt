Then Urashima became a crane and flew up into the void. Indeed, this Urashima's years had been cunningly folded up and placed inside the box by the turtle. Thus he had maintained his life for seven hundred years. Though he was told "Do not open it and look," how foolish it was that he opened it.

　On the night I meet you, Urashima's jeweled box—
　　How regretful are my tears for having opened it

So it has been sung in poetry. Among all beings with emotions, none fail to know compassion—how much more so for human beings. Those who receive kindness but know no gratitude are likened to trees and stones. The deep affection between husband and wife is called a bond of two lifetimes, and truly these are precious things. Urashima Tarō became a crane and took form on Mount Hōrai. The turtle, with three rocky dwellings on its shell, came to span ten thousand generations. Thus, as auspicious symbols, we speak of the crane and turtle. Simply put, people should have compassion. Those with compassion will have an auspicious future.

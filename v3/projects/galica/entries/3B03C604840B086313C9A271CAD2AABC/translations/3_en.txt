(Ta)rō said to this turtle: "Among all living creatures, it is said that cranes live for a thousand years and turtles for ten thousand years—you are a creature with a long life. It would be pitiful for your life to end suddenly here, so I will save you. You should always remember this kindness." And with that, he released the turtle back into the sea from whence it came.

Thus Urashima Tarō returned home when the day grew dark. The next day, when he went out toward the bay intending to fish and looked around, he saw a small boat floating far out at sea.

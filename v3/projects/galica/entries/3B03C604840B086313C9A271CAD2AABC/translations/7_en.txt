So they exchanged vows, and their pledge was not shallow—like the paired-wing birds in heaven and the intertwined branches on earth, they spent their days and nights together with their karmic bond deep and lasting.

Lotus flowers in the pond were adorned with dew, and many waterfowl played in the cool ripples at the water's edge. The treetops of the trees grew thick, and the voices of cicadas rang through the sky, while from between the clouds of a passing evening shower came the voice of a cuckoo calling out—perhaps announcing summer.

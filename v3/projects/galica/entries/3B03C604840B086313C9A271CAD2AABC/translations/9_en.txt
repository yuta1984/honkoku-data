"...that you would not leave me even for a moment—is this how it shall be? Though I have poured my heart into such pleas, if we part now, in what world shall we meet again? As for the bond between two lives, even if our vow in this world is like a dream or phantom, surely in the next life we will be born as one lotus bond." So saying, she wept bitterly. After a while, the woman said, "Now what should I hide from you? I am the turtle of this Dragon Palace, and you saved my life at Enoshima shore.

To repay that kindness, I have become your wife in this way. Also, please take this as my keepsake," and she drew out a beautiful box from her left side, saying "Under no circumstances must you open this box," and handed it to him. Following the principle that "those who meet must part" (eshajōri), though knowing that those who meet must inevitably separate, unable to prevent it, she composed a poem:
　After days have passed, the travel robes of the garden fence becoming withered,
　We part and separate—when shall you come to see me again?

Urashima's Reply
　Parting and going, the empty Chinese robes above
　　If our bond is deep, I shall come to see you again

So Urashima Tarō, while both cherished their reluctance to part, knew this could not continue, so taking the keepsake box, he returned to his homeland. Continuing to think of the events from past to future that he could not forget, as he returned across the distant wave-path, Urashima Tarō composed this poem:
　The visage of one with whom I made a fleeting vow—
　　What shall I do with this body that cannot forget?

When Urashima returned to his homeland and looked around, his relatives had all disappeared and it had become a field where tigers and wolves dwelt. Seeing this, Urashima thought "What manner of thing is this?" and looking to one side, he saw a hut of brushwood, so he approached and said he wished to speak. From within the house came an old man of about eighty years who said "Where have you come from?" Urashima replied, "Is there no trace of Urashima in this place?" The old man said, "What manner of person are you that you inquire about Urashima's whereabouts?"

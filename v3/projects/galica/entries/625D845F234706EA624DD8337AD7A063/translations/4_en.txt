Like the teaching bird taught by the gods, the ephemerality of making one's wish the delight of being caressed in the garden - though one might think this is due to the rumors of handsome men, well, who knows? The diving women of Tsukushi with mysterious fires and the men of Ise, once famous throughout the world, have become old tales. Now, pure as the water of aqueducts, Eastern men with Kyoto courtesans. Country-raised and wasted away by love, with beautiful features unsuited to the countryside. With many love letters vying for attention, pillow books understood without reading. Spring dawn gradually breaks - please look and see, like something painted in a picture.

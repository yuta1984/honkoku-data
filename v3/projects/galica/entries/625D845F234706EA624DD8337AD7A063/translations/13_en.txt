"If we just go, isn't that what you're saying?"
〽 (Okame) "Even so, I don't know what kind of house that place we're going to is, but it will probably be uncomfortable, so please exchange marriage vows with me now."
〽 (Yohei) "What do you intend to do for the marriage vows?"
〽 (Okame) "What? It's obvious what I mean. Don't pretend you don't know. Come now, come on."
〽 (Yohei) "Do it?"
〽 (Okame) "That's right."
〽 (Yohei) "What can we do in this field?"
〽 (Okame) "What are you saying? Who would come to a place like this? I was so anxious during that night's wedding commotion that I still haven't calmed down. What kind of commotion do you think it was? 'The groom is coming now' and all that—it was such a great uproar. Having run away in the middle of all that, I don't know what happened afterward, but I can imagine."
〽 (Yohei) "If you hadn't run out and had just stayed there confused, by now tonight you'd be getting it for the first time. I'd like to see what kind of face you'd have made then."

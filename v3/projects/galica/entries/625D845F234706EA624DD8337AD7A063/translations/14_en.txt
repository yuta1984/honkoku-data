seems like it would be."
〽 (Okame) "No way! Who would let them do that? I've firmly locked my heart up tight."
〽 (Yohei) "I see, so from the waist down it's wide open?"
〽 (Okame) "What are you saying! That's the Okame of the kagura dance. I'm different from that one. Stop such foolish talk and hurry up and do it."
Being urged "come on, come on," Yohei too, though he wasn't made of rock, his member stood firm and erect like a rock.

〽 (Yohei) "Then let's do it here," he said as he mounted on top of Okame. Okame had been waiting and ready for some time, and with the love juices already flowing, even her untouched virgin parts offered no resistance as he pushed in. She lifted up from below while he thrust from above, with wet sloshing sounds, taking pleasure as much as their hearts desired. Without speaking, only their breathing could be heard, going "suu suu."
〽 (Yohei) "There, there, there, it's completely done. Now, now, I'm satisfied."

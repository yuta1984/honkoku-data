Some hang hand towels over their shoulders, while others tuck them at their waist. Some wear leggings while others go barefoot with their hem tucked up. Most commonly, they tie them half at the waist and half at the feet, knotted like a shell's mouth - each competing in beauty with their own new styles and new fashions. Among all this, their matching overall patterns feature large crests with paired-wing designs dyed around the solar plexus area. Their hair is styled in "lotus-hanging," "choppily Honda style" with the front section glossy and twisted to the left, and other styles like flat-combed square ginkgo. Mixing both stylish and unstylish together, what they polish are their foreheads and fair-weather geta. Even in the names of sandals, they don't speak of cold rice. That "rounosuke-kai" also hesitates to call it a pipe stem - isn't this also amusing? Pointing at people coming and going, they loudly and officiously call out "rain cape!" "haori!" "umbrella behind!" and glare as they pass - perhaps this is to reform the public thoroughfare? The details of this matter are still unclear. Among the many people coming and going, when they see people from other lands, just like those who long for the southern breeze of that Women's Country, they firmly refuse to be mere spectators, doing everything short of mending the sandals they've heard about in stories, but this is never permitted.

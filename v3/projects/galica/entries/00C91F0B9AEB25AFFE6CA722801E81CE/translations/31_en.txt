Though this was truly the role assignment of fixed karma, "What, everyone, isn't he far too young?" - perhaps this signal of the hyōshigi (wooden clappers) was too distant, what a strange transformation of stage props this was. The patrons' support now grew weak, and though they cried out in distress "Ah, this cannot be!" even when trying to stop it with "Wait, wait!" it was impossible to prevent. Therefore, the tears of grief fell endlessly like the continuous summer rains, and it seemed that even the water level of the Ichikawa (river) would rise. Unexpectedly, at the Misu theater, he reached the stage of aspiring for the Pure Land and became a lotus throne leader - what a pity for this master of the "Edo-rejecting-the-impure-land" fellows. The memorial chanting was no different from the worldly "ja-ja" (kabuki musical accompaniment). Who would have thought that we would hear the sermon delivery of funeral guidance, triggered by the sutra chanting that followed the percussion ensemble of bells, gongs, and bowls in the theater district? Meanwhile, the men and women crowding to worship at the temple, the old and young filling the main street - just as when the Teaching Lord, the World-Honored One, disappeared in the waves of the Bagmati River - how lamentable this is. "Ah, what a pitiful soul!" - the scene of people crying and wailing was unbearable to witness.

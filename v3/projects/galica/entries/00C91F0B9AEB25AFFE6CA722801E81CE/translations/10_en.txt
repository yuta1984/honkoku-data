rewritten with added coloring, nothing more. This too is old-fashioned." Upon hearing this, (the publisher) turned bright red with veins bulging on his forehead,
saying, "You won't accept the new work I've specially come to request, yet you attach a bad reputation to my treasured printing blocks—
this is unacceptable! Then I shall speak my mind too. Even if you
exert all your talent to write new works, insider jokes won't sell to the general public.
I may be unlearned in remaking old things, but I prioritize making works for common people, which is why
I can clearly see what will sell. Even the wise make mistakes despite careful consideration,
while even fools have their insights. No matter how much you dangle your
superficial learning from your nose tip with pretension, you're at best a gesaku writer. Scribbling trivial things, producing merely
popular books that last only a year. You cannot achieve the great work that would leave a fine name for posterity.
Therefore, regardless of new or old, whatever sells is the winner!"
I was completely overwhelmed by this argument and could not utter a single word in response. "Indeed, you are absolutely
right," I could only say. Finally, I consented and completed this one-volume work.

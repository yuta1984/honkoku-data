(the verse) learned by country men and women, or from retainers who still retain the mannerisms of Hakuen Suketakaya, to court ladies who drool over old stories of Shōchō Chūsha—all this is to make the living likenesses of current actors easily viewable.

◯Actors of high, middle, and low ranks are mixed together without selecting order. Of course, the proofreading is not complete, so actors who are currently on hiatus, or traveling, or who have been omitted are quite numerous. The supplement is left to "Sangaikyō" and is not detailed here. Everything is the same as in "Butai Ōgi" (Stage Fan), "Natsu no Fuji" (Summer Fuji), and "Gakuya-tsū" (Backstage Guide).

◯Beginning with Sawamura Tosshi, for the actors patronized by Great Edo who have been traveling recently, two pictures of Naniwa Shinmachi are presented. The rest can be understood by inference.

◯About two years have passed since this entire book was completed. Due to various problems, publication has been delayed. Therefore, though Tojaku (Iwai Hanshirō) and Rankō (Nakamura Noshio) and their associates have already died, we do not revise their entries. Since they were particularly famous actors with devoted patrons, we preserve them in this picture book for posterity.

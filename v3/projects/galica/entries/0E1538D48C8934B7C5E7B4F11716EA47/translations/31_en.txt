XII
COUNCIL HELD BY THE RATS

　　　　A cat named Rodilardus
　　Was causing such havoc among the rats
　　　　That one could hardly see any more of them,
So many had he put in their graves.
The few that remained, not daring to leave their holes,
Could find only a quarter of their fill to eat;
And Rodilard was known among the miserable folk
　　　　Not as a cat, but as a devil.
　　　　Now, one day when far and high
　　　　The gallant fellow went to seek a mate,
During all the revelry he had with his lady,
The remaining rats held chapter in a corner
　　　　On the present necessity.
First their elder, a very prudent person,
Gave his opinion that they should, sooner rather than later,
Attach a bell to Rodilard's neck;
　　　　That thus, when he went to war,
Warned by his approach, they could flee underground;

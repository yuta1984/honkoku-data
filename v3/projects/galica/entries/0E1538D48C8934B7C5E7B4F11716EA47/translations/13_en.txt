IV 
THE FROG WHO WANTED TO MAKE HERSELF
　　AS BIG AS THE OX

　　　　A frog saw an ox
　　　　Which seemed to her of fine size.
She, who was no bigger than an egg in total,
Envious, stretches, and swells, and labors
　　To equal the animal in size;
　　　　Saying: "Look well, my sister;
Is this enough? Tell me; am I not there yet?" --
"No." -- "Am I there now?" -- "Not at all." -- "How about now?"
-- "You're not even close." The pitiful fool
　　　　Swelled so much that she burst.

The world is full of people who are no wiser:
Every bourgeois wants to build like the great lords,
　　Every petty prince wants ambassadors,
　　　　Every marquis wants to have pages.

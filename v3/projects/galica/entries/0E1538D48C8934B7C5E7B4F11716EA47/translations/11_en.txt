What a fine task you give us!
We would need a thousand people
To clear all this district.
When the hemp was fully grown,
The swallow added: This does not bode well;
Bad seed comes up quickly.
But, since until now no one has believed me in anything,
As soon as you see that the earth
Is covered, and that the people,
No longer occupied with their wheat,
Will make war on the little birds,
When bird-lime and nets
Will catch small birds,
No longer fly from place to place,
Stay at home, or change climate.
Imitate the duck, the crane and the woodcock.
But you are not in a condition
To cross, as we do, deserts and waves,
And to go seek other worlds;
This is why you have only one safe course,
It is to shut yourself in the hole of some wall.
The little birds, weary of hearing her,
Began to chatter as confusedly
As the Trojans did when poor Cassandra
Merely opened her mouth.
It befell them as it did the others:
Many a little bird found himself held captive as a slave.

We listen only to instincts that are our own,
And believe in evil only when it has come.

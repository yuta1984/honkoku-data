THE TWO BULLS AND THE
　　　　FROG

　Two bulls were fighting over who would possess
　　　　A heifer along with her territory.
　　　　A frog was sighing about it.
　　　　"What's wrong?" asked
　　　　Someone from the croaking folk.
　　　　"Oh! Don't you see," said she,
　　　　"That the end of this quarrel
Will be the exile of one; that the other, chasing him away,
Will make him renounce the flowering fields?
He will no longer reign over the grass of the meadows,
But will come to our marshes to reign over the reeds;
And, trampling us underfoot down to the bottom of the waters,
Now one of us, then another, we'll have to suffer
From the combat caused by Madame Heifer."
　　　　This fear was sensible.
　　　　One of the bulls came to their dwelling
　　　　To hide at their expense,
　　　　He crushed twenty per hour.

　　　　Alas! We see that in all times,
The small have suffered from the follies of the great.

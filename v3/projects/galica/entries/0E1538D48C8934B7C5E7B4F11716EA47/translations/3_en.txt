The selection of La Fontaine's fables that we offer to the public is primarily based on the greater or lesser difficulty we encountered in conveying the meaning of these fables to the Japanese artists who were kind enough to lend us their assistance in illustrating them, each according to the style of the school to which he belongs, and which a long sojourn among them has enabled us to appreciate.

Kawanabe Kyōsui (daughter and pupil of the famous Kyōsai, one of the great artists of modern Japan, celebrated for the ink paintings he left behind, in which he made a complete study of the crow), quite naturally chose, among other fables, "The Crow and the Fox."

Kanō Tomonobu, one of the representatives of the great Kanō family, sufficiently known to art lovers that it is not necessary to sing their praises, shows us in the fables "The Frog and the Rat" and "The Cock and the Pearl," not to mention others, that he is indeed of that family.

"The Two Bulls and the Frog" and "The Dragon with Many Heads and the Dragon with Many Tails," and others still, have been illustrated by Okakura Shūsui, who also belongs, by his type of talent, to the Kanō school.

Eda Sadahiko, a talented landscape artist, had the happy idea of placing the scene of the fable "The Rat and the Oyster" in front of the island of Enoshima, known to all collectors of Japanese prints.

THE FOX AND THE GRAPES

　　A certain Gascon fox (others say Norman),
　Nearly dying of hunger, saw high up on a vine
　　　　Some apparently ripe grapes,
　　　　Covered with a red skin.
The gallant fellow would gladly have made a meal of them;
　　　　But since he could not reach them:
"They are too green," he said, "and good for ruffians."

　　　　Did he not do better than to complain?

THE JAY DRESSED IN PEACOCK'S FEATHERS

A peacock molted: a jay took his plumage,
　　　　Then fitted it on himself;
Then among other peacocks strutted proudly,
　　　　Thinking himself a beautiful personage.
　　　　Someone recognized him: he found himself mocked,
　　　　Fooled, whistled at, ridiculed, played with,
And by the gentlemen peacocks plucked in a strange manner;
Even having taken refuge among his own kind,
　　　　He was shown the door by them.

There are enough jays on two feet like him,
Who often adorn themselves with others' spoils,
　　　　And who are called plagiarists.
I keep silent about it, and do not wish to cause them any trouble:
　　　　That is not my business.

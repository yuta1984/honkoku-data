I
THE CICADA AND THE ANT

The cicada, having sung
　　All summer long,
Found herself quite destitute
When the north wind came:
Not a single tiny morsel
Of fly or little worm.
She went to cry famine
At the ant's, her neighbor,
Begging her to lend
Some grain to subsist on
Until the new season.--
"I will pay you back," she said,
"Before harvest time, on my honor as an animal,
Interest and principal."
The ant is not a lender:
That is her least fault.--
"What were you doing in the warm weather?"
She said to this borrower.--
"Night and day to all comers
I was singing, if you please."--
"You were singing? I'm delighted!
Well then, dance now."

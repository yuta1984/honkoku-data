THE CROW AND THE FOX

Master Crow, perched on a tree,
　　Held a cheese in his beak.
Master Fox, enticed by the smell,
　　Spoke to him roughly these words:
　　Hey! Good morning, Master Crow.
How pretty you are! How beautiful you seem to me!
　　Without lying, if your song
　　Matches your plumage,
You are the phoenix of the inhabitants of these woods.
At these words the crow is beside himself with joy;
　　And, to show his beautiful voice,
He opens his beak wide, lets fall his prey.
The fox seizes it, and says: My good Sir,
　　　　Learn that every flatterer
　　Lives at the expense of the one who listens to him.
This lesson is surely worth a cheese.
　　The crow, ashamed and confused,
Swore, but a little too late, that he wouldn't be caught again.

trailing in the air, and above the clouds there are three palaces. The phoenix-tiled roofs soar high, and rainbow-like beams stretch beautifully across them. All the aerial tower pavilions are so solemn, pure, and magnificent that they are beyond description. There are agate pillars, amber crossbeams, coral balustrades, golden rafters, and giant clam shell blinds hung with pearl ornaments. Crystal doors, tortoiseshell fences, and lapis lazuli tiles are arranged in rows. The fragrances of orchid musk and aloes-wood incense drift eternally without cease. The garden is paved with gold and silver sand, and the pond is filled with the eight-virtued waters.

On the shores of the pond gather phoenixes, kalavinka birds, and various other birds with beautiful voices. When one hears them singing with their wing-tips aligned, the heart becomes crystal clear. The colors of flowers blooming in wild profusion, and the fragrances of abundantly ripened fruits perfume and illuminate all directions - there can be nothing to compare with this. Various immortals frolic among the flowers and play in the water, perform music and dance, eating the four types of flesh mushrooms, five-colored exchange pears, fire dates, and watermelons as their food, and drinking the heavenly liquor of jade elixir and golden essence.

Also, during the reign of Emperor Suinin, he commanded a retainer named Tajima-no-mori to seek the kaku-no-mi (fragrant fruits) from the land of Tokoyo (the Eternal World). Mori immediately received the imperial command and went to the land of Tokoyo, where he obtained the fragrant fruits and presented them to the Emperor.
What is called kaku-no-mi refers to the tachibana (Japanese citrus) that is now planted and cultivated in our imperial court and cherished as an auspicious thing. It is said that the planting of tachibana in front of the Right Palace Guards' quarters also derives from this historical precedent.

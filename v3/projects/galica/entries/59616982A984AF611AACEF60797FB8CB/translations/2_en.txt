〽I have been waiting
　since May—
　you cannot know
how much, oh my!
　Put the sake aside for now,
　and come,
　　　　　　let's sleep a while

〽Indeed, I too, all along the way—
　since my parents came, I must rush off first,
　the restlessness at home won't settle

Birds' shadows and mice crying,
being tormented—this too is
a way to ease the heart's sorrows.
The cold sake that complaints make
one drink is also melancholy,
ah, what vexation!

〽If I were to do such
things with you, master,
divine punishment would befall us
〽When you say such things again,
I will never leave you,
so please call me your foster mother

Harmoniously with the plum blossoms
The warbler chirps in spring haze, violets
Dandelions, morning glories no less beautiful as keepsakes
Flower buds blooming in the four seasons' rain—
For whose sake? Why do you, master,
bewitch women so?
You wicked person

〽I too
shall now come
Come come
Haa ah ah ah ah

Therefore, even women of today, no matter how beautiful they may be, shouldn't be so picky about men and carelessly reject them with such pride - that's the moral of the story〽Oh my, oh my, while it would be wonderful to listen to your story, it's quite shocking to hear. Thank you for that long and interesting tale. Please have some tea〽Oh, you'll actually have some tea? Thank you very much.

[Song in the illustration]
What does the spring warbler
wear to sleep?
Using flowers as a pillow
and covering itself with leaves
yoi, yoi, yoi

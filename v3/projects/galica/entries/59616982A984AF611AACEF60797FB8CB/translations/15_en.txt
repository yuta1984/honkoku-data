...there was no place that brought satisfaction, no one who pleased the heart, so they were all rejected one after another, and while dealing with the aftermath of all these rejections, there were still many who could not give up and continued to burn with longing.
Here, a person called the Minor Captain of Fukakusa, unable to bear his feelings of love and longing, directly approached her and
　　　　　　　　　　　　　earnestly laid out all his feelings and wrote
　　　　　　　　　　　　　his entreaties, but his words created an
　　　　　　　　　　　　　inescapable situation, so he said that from tonight
　　　　　　　　　　　　　for one hundred nights he would visit continuously,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　and if you would show your true sincerity,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　then at that time I will follow your heart...

　　Night cherry blossoms—
　　　merry crows
　　dancing and dancing in the
　　　small shade of flowers,
　　someone or other
　　is there, you know
 　　don't play dumb
The budding willows swayed
by the wind, eh eh,
　fluttering lightly—
that's how it is

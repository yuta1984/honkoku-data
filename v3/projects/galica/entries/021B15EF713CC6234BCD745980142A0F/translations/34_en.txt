When he was sent back, he rode his horse and came from Tsukushi in just seven days. Looking at the letter, it said: "I have labored to send people out to seek the fire-rat's fur robe and offer it to you. In both the present world and the ancient world, this hide has been something not easily obtained. Long ago, a wise sage from Tenjiku (India) brought it across to this country, and hearing that it was at a mountain temple in the west, I petitioned the court and with great effort purchased it to offer to you. The provincial governor told the messenger that the payment in gold was insufficient. So I added my own goods to make the purchase. Now I should receive fifty ryō of gold. Please send the travel expenses with the returning ship. If you will not provide the gold, then I wish to return that robe as collateral."

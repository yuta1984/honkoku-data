All the people who should accompany him saw him off as far as Naniwa. The prince said he would travel in secret, making it appear as if many people were with him, but actually departed with only his close retainers. The people who saw him off returned home. After making it appear to people that he had departed, about three days later he secretly returned. Since he had given all instructions beforehand, he then summoned six craftsmen who were skilled in working with precious materials, had them build a house that people could not easily approach, made triple-layered furnaces and secluded himself there. While keeping the craftsmen inside, the prince also secluded himself in the same place, and opening smoke holes above all sixteen territories under his control, he set about creating the jeweled branch.

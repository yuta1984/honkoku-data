"Having caused so many men to waste their lives by not meeting them, what kind of woman is this Kaguya-hime? Go and see her, then return to report." Fusako accepted the command and departed. She went to the bamboo cutter's house, respectfully announced herself as an envoy, and met with them. The lady (Fusako) said to the court lady, "By imperial command, Kaguya-hime is said to be beautiful. I was told to go see her well and return, so I have come." They replied, "If that is so, let me speak thus," and went inside (the house). When they told Kaguya-hime, "Quickly meet with that imperial messenger," Kaguya-hime said, "I do not have good looks. How could I show myself?" When they said, "What unpleasant things you say! How could we treat the Emperor's messenger carelessly?"

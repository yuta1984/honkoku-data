He was deeply moved to pity and neither partook of meals nor engaged in musical entertainments. Summoning the ministers and senior courtiers, he asked, "Which mountain is closest to heaven?" Someone replied in audience that "the mountain in Suruga Province is both close to this capital and close to heaven, Your Majesty." Upon hearing this, he composed:

Unable to meet her again,
What use is a medicine that prevents death?

He added a jar to the elixir of immortality that Princess Kaguya had presented, and bestowed it upon an imperial messenger. As the imperial envoy, he summoned a person called "Tsuki no Iwakasa" to carry it to the summit of the mountain in Suruga Province.

"What shall I say?" he asks. The minister answers, saying, "This robe was something that did not exist even in China, but I struggled and finally managed to seek and obtain it. What doubt could there be? Even so, quickly burn it and see." So when they threw it into the fire to burn it, it blazed up in flames. "Then it was indeed the skin of some other creature," they said. When the minister saw this, his face turned the color of grass leaves (pale green) as he sat there. Princess Kaguya rejoiced, saying "Oh, how delightful!" She put her reply poem to the one he had composed into a box and returned it.

If I had known it would burn completely without trace,
I would have unexpectedly set aside this fire-rat robe to look at it.

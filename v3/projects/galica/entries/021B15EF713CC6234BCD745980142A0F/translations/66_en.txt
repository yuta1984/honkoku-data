Without informing anyone, he secretly went to the office and, mingling among the men, had them work through the night to catch [the swallows]. When Kuratsu-maru reported this, [his lord] was extremely pleased and said, "How joyful it is that my wish can be fulfilled when there is no one else to send here!" He removed his own garments and bestowed them upon him. The next evening, he went to this office, gave his orders, and dispatched [the men]. When evening fell, he went to that office to observe, and indeed the swallows had built their nests. Kuratsu-maro reported: "We will have a man ride in a coarse basket that can pivot and be raised up, and have him reach into the swallow's nest to search [for the jewel]."

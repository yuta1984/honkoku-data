-mori was sent along as an escort. Upon arriving, he presented the gold to Ōkei who was in China. Ōkei unfolded the letter, read it, and wrote a reply: "The fire-rat's fur robe is something that does not exist in this country. I have heard of it by reputation, but it is something I have never seen. If it were something that existed in the world, I would have brought it to this country as well. It is an extremely difficult trade. However, if it exists in Tenjiku (India) or has been brought across to Tamasaka, perhaps I could inquire around wealthy merchants and seek it out. If it does not exist, I shall return the gold along with the messenger." It was heard that the Chinese ship had returned. When Ono no Fusamori heard that he was coming to report, he mounted his agitated horse and rode off.

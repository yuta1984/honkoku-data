Even while lingering in this floating world, with days and nights
of ceaseless toil【Ge】, if one's heart alone
accords with the true path【Ge】, even without prayer,
in the end it shall become a karmic connection
to Buddhist enlightenment【Ge-kuse】This is merely the temporary
entanglement with earth, water, fire, and wind

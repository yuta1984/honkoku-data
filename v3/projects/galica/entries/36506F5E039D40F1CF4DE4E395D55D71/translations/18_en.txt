【Jōchi】The work of making one's way through the world is truly melancholy
【Shite-jō】How pitiful! Though born into the human realm,
spending dawn to dusk in this floating world, the sadness
of tormenting one's body【Wakisashi】These are the fleeting words
of a person, but first one must save oneself
rather than praying for Buddha-hood

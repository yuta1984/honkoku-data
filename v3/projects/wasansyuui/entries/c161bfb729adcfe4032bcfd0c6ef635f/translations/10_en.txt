〽Place 20 ken in the quotient and compare using the multiplication table, add 2 from 1×2 to the divisor to make the divisor 25. Also comparing the divisor with the quotient using the multiplication table to subtract from the dividend: subtract 400 bu from 2×2, subtract 100 bu from 2×5, thus subtracting from the dividend. This is shown in the next diagram.

〽Again comparing the quotient with 廉 (ren) using the multiplication table, add 2 from 1×2 to the divisor to make the divisor 45. Now both divisor and 廉 (ren) each descend by 1 place.
　　　　　　　　This is also shown in the next diagram.

　Now place another 3 ken in the quotient. Comparing this 3 ken with 廉 (ren) using the multiplication table, add 3 from 1×3 to the divisor to make the divisor 48. Comparing this divisor with the newly placed quotient of 3 ken using the multiplication table to subtract from the dividend: subtract 120 bu from 3×4, and also subtract 24 from 3×8, thus completely subtracting from the dividend to find the quotient is 23 ken. This is namely the horizontal dimension. Adding the shorter 5 ken to this gives the vertical dimension of 28 ken.

Establish the unknown 1 as the vertical "0｜1", subtract the difference from within to make the horizontal "-5｜1", multiply by the vertical to make the product of vertical and horizontal "0｜-5｜1", namely canceling with the stated product "-644｜-5｜1", opening by square root extraction to obtain the quotient 28 ken, which fits.

《Title: Sixth Section - Corresponding Root Extraction (sōō kaihe)》
There is gold paper with horizontal 5 sun and vertical 8 sun. Now if making similar gold paper using ten pieces of 3-sun squares, what will be the vertical and horizontal dimensions? Answer:
　　　　　　　　　Vertical 1 shaku 2 sun, Horizontal 7 sun 5 bu
　　　　　　　　　First multiply 3 sun together: 3×3 makes 9 bu. Multiplying this by 10 pieces makes 90 bu. Also multiplying this by the horizontal 5 sun makes 450 bu. Place this as the dividend. Also place the vertical 8 sun as 廉 (ren), and divide by square root extraction. Thus know the horizontal is 7 sun 5 bu. ○Also said: dividing 450 bu by the vertical 8 sun gives 56 bu 2 bu 5 rin. Calling this by square root extraction gives the horizontal as 7 sun 5 bu. This is known from the vertical.
[Also said: multiplying the horizontal 5 sun with the vertical 8 sun, 5×8 makes 40□]

Use this as the divisor and □ place it. Now again multiply 5 sun together to get 5×5 = 25 bu. Multiplying this by 90 bu (the number of bu for 10 sheets of foil) gives 2,250 bu. Dividing this by the left divisor gives 56 bu 2 bu 5 rin. Dividing this by square root extraction gives the horizontal dimension being made now.

▲○ Again multiply 8 sun (vertical) together to get 8×8 = 64 bu. Multiplying this by 90 bu (the foil number) gives 5,760 bu. Dividing this by the left divisor of 40 bu gives 144 bu. Dividing this by square root extraction gives the vertical dimension of 1 shaku 2 sun.

Establish the unknown quantity (天元) as 1 for the current horizontal dimension, multiply by the old vertical dimension to get the current vertical dimension based on the old horizontal dimension. Multiply by the current horizontal dimension to get the current product based on the old horizontal dimension. Arrange 3 sun to the left, square it and multiply by ten. Multiply by the old horizontal dimension and when arranged to the left, it cancels out. Opening this by square root extraction yields a quotient of 7 sun 5 bu. This matches.

《Title: Seventh Section - Cube Root Extraction (kairitsu-hō)》
▲There is a cubic volume of 3,375 tsubo. When making this into a four-sided six-faced [cube], how much is it? 
　[Answer:] 15 ken on all four sides and six faces.

Place the volume of 3,375 tsubo in the dividend position. Borrow one counter and place it in the corner position. Counting by two rows each as 1, 10, 100 to see the place values, it is in the tens place. Raise the corner position by one place and establish 10 ken in the quotient. 《Whether going up or down》
　The divisor (法) is one row, the auxiliary divisor (廉) is two rows, the corner (隅) is three rows.
　　　This is shown in the next diagram.

Now compare the quotient with the corner using the multiplication table to add 2×1 to the auxiliary divisor (廉). Again using the multiplication table for quotient and auxiliary divisor, add 1 from 1×1 to the divisor. Again comparing this divisor with the quotient using the multiplication table, subtract 1,000 tsubo from 1×1 from the dividend. This is shown in the next diagram.

Again compare the quotient with the corner using the multiplication table to add 2×1 to the auxiliary divisor, making it 2. Compare this auxiliary divisor with the quotient using the multiplication table to add 2 from 1×2 to the divisor, making it 3. Again compare the quotient with the corner using the multiplication table to add 1 from 1×1 to the auxiliary divisor, making it 3. Now the divisor, auxiliary divisor, and corner each descend by one place.
　　Record this in the next diagram.

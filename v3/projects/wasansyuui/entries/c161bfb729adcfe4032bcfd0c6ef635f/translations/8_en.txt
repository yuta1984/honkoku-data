〽Again, comparing the quotient with 廉 (ren), using the multiplication table, add 1×1 to the divisor to make the divisor 2. Now both the divisor and 廉 (ren) each descend 1 place.
The divisor descends 1 row at a time, 廉 (ren) descends 2 rows at a time. Ascending follows the same pattern.
Record this in the next diagram.

Now again place 4 ken in the quotient. Comparing this 4 with 廉 (ren), using the multiplication table, add 4 from 1×4 to the divisor to make the divisor 24.
Show this in the next diagram.

Now combining the divisor with the newly placed quotient, using the multiplication table to subtract from the dividend: subtract 80 bu from 2×4, subtract 16 bu from 4×4, and all the dividend is subtracted away. Know that the quotient is 14 ken per side. Afterward, the divisor and 廉 (ren) are not used.

Square Root Extraction
Establish the unit as a square surface "0┃1", square it to make it a square area "0┃1", which cancels with the given area "196┃0┃1"
Extract the square root to obtain quotient 14 ken per side.

▲There is a square area of 225,625 bu. When made into a square, how many ken per side does it become?
[Answer] 475 ken per side.

Place the number 225,625 bu as the dividend, borrow 1 counter and place it as 廉 (ren). When examining the place values, there is no thousands place, so it is the hundreds place. First consider 500 ken per side, but since 5×5 = 250,000 bu is too much, consider 400 ken per side, raise 廉 (ren) by 2 places, and place 400 ken in the quotient.
Show this remainder in the next diagram.

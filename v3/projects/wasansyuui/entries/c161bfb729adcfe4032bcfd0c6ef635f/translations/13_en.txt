〽Now again establish 2 ken in the quotient. Compare this 2 ken with the corner using the multiplication table to add 2 from 1×2 to the auxiliary divisor, making it 36. Again compare this auxiliary divisor with the newly established quotient using the multiplication table to add 6 from 2×3 and 12 from 2×6 to the divisor, making it 452. Again compare this divisor with the newly established quotient of 2 ken using the multiplication table to subtract from the dividend: subtract 800 tsubo from 2×4, subtract 100 tsubo from 2×5, and subtract 4 tsubo from 2×2. When all are subtracted from the dividend, the quotient becomes 12 ken. This is the square face. Adding 4 ken to this gives the height as 16 ken. The divisor, auxiliary divisor, and corner are not needed afterwards.

Establish the unknown quantity (天元) as 1 for the square face, add the difference to make the height. Multiply this by the power of the square face to make the cubic volume. It cancels with the stated volume. Opening this by cube root extraction yields a quotient of 12 ken. This matches the problem.

There is a cubic volume of 12,168 tsubo. The height is 8 ken shorter than the square face. What are this square face and height?

　　　Answer: 《Square face: 26 ken square, Height: 18 ken》
　　　Method: Place the volume in the dividend. Multiply the shortage of 8 ken together to get 64 from 8×8 and place it in the divisor. Double the shortage of 8 ken to make 16 ken. Place this in the auxiliary divisor. Using 1 as the corner, divide by the cube root extraction method to find the height as 18 ken. Adding 8 ken to this gives the square face as 26 ken.

▲There is a cubic volume of 2,106 tsubo. The width is 4 ken longer than the thickness, and the height is 9 ken longer than the thickness. What are this thickness, width, and height?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　Thickness: 9 ken
　　　　　Answer:　　　　Height: 18 ken
　　　　　　　　　　　　　Width: 13 ken

　　　　　Method: Place the volume in the dividend. Multiply 9 ken by 4 ken to get 36. Place this in the divisor. Add 9 ken and 4 ken together to make 13 ken. Place this in the auxiliary divisor. Using 1 as the corner, divide by cube root extraction to find □ thickness as 9 ken. Adding 4 □ to this

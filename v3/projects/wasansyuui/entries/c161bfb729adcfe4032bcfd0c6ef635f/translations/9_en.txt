〽Now comparing the quotient with 廉 (ren), using the multiplication table, add 4 from 1×4 to the divisor to make the divisor 4. In this way, comparing the divisor with the quotient using the multiplication table, subtract 160,000 bu from the dividend using 4×4. This is also shown in the next diagram.

　　　　　　〽Again comparing the quotient with 廉 (ren)
　　　　　　　using the multiplication table,
　　　　　　　add 4 from 1×4 to the divisor
　　　　　　　to make the divisor 8. Both divisor and 廉 (ren)
　　　　　　　each descend by 1 place.
　　　　　　　Also record this in the next diagram.

〽Now place another 70 ken in the quotient. Comparing this 70 ken with 廉 (ren) using the multiplication table, add 7 from 1×7 to the divisor to make the divisor 87. Comparing this divisor with the newly placed quotient of 70 ken using the multiplication table to subtract from the dividend: subtract 56,000 bu from 7×8, subtract 4,900 bu from 7×7, thus subtracting from the dividend. This is also recorded in the next diagram.

　　　　　　〽Now comparing the newly placed quotient of 70 ken
　　　　　　　with 廉 (ren) using the multiplication table,
　　　　　　　add 7 from 1×7 to the divisor
　　　　　　　to make the divisor 94. Both divisor and 廉 (ren)
　　　　　　　each descend by 1 place.
　　　　　　　Also record this in the next diagram.

　〽Now place another 5 ken in the quotient. Comparing this quotient
　　with 廉 (ren) using the multiplication table, add 5 from 1×5
　　to the divisor to make the divisor 945. Comparing this divisor
　　with the newly placed quotient of 5 ken using the multiplication table
　　to subtract from the dividend:
　　subtract 4,500 bu from 5×9,
　　subtract 200 bu from 4×5,
　　subtract 25 bu from 5×5,
　　and when all is subtracted
from the dividend, the quotient
is known to be 475 ken per side.
The divisor and 廉 (ren) are not
needed afterward.

《Title: Fifth Section - Rectangular Root Extraction (taijū kaihe)》
▲There is an area of 644 bu. If the horizontal dimension is 5 ken shorter than the vertical dimension, what are the vertical and horizontal dimensions?
　　　　　　　　Answer: Vertical 28 ken, Horizontal 23 ken
　　　　　　　　Place the area 644 bu as the dividend. Also place □
　　　　　　　　□□□□, borrowing 1 counter
　　　　　　　　□□□ When examining the place values,
　　　　　　　　it is the tens place. Both divisor and 廉 (ren) rise by 1 place
　　　　　　　　and place 20 ken in the quotient. Also the next diagram □

Preface

At some point in time, something called "Nagasaki mujin" began in the world, serving as assistance for the people to make their way through life. However, without properly understanding the distinction between profit and loss, people indulge in taking gold and silver as a matter of course. Consequently, when examining the profit from calculations with an interest rate of sixteen percent, there are only differences of opinion in the world between the beginning and the end. Perhaps it is merely that the abacus calculations in remote regions are mistaken. Generally speaking, arithmetic measures the mysteries of heaven and earth. Now here, I shall humbly divide the calculation methods of mujin.

Someone asked me about Nagasaki mujin:

1. Assuming one bu of gold, eleven mujin participants, calculated at sixteen percent interest, those who receive pay out forty me of permanent money annually, settling the matter in ten years.

2. The first position receives 250 me, the eleventh position receives 400 me. From the second position onward, they gradually receive increasing amounts. Those who do not receive have their payments gradually decrease, paying until the eighth round, and not paying from the ninth round onward.

3. Working with interest-free money, each person's payments from beginning to end. Similarly, regarding profit and loss of money received, gradually asking about interest.

4. Working with twenty percent interest money, asking about money received. Similarly, regarding profit and loss.

5. Asking about interest gradually from first to last position. Profit and loss from beginning to end. Additionally, asking about compound interest.

6. The matter of quick oral transmission of square root and cube root methods.

I answered and said:　　　　　●"Ei" refers to one hundred me of one ryō of gold
　　○Regarding taking increases

First position takes: 250 me of ei　　Second position: 257 momme 5 bu of ei
Third position: 265 momme　　Fourth position: 272 momme 5 bu

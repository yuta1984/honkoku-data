2,197 tsubo - Finding the cubic dimension through cube root calculation
　　Side: 13 ken (intervals)

Method: Place 2,197 tsubo as the base, and examining the true position, we know that 10 ken cubed equals 1,000 tsubo. Subtract 1,000 tsubo as one advance of one advance, establishing 10 ken. 1,197 tsubo remains. For estimation, match the cube root 3 with the true 10 ken, establishing 133. With this

3, the remaining 1,970 tsubo becomes 3 × 3 × 10 = 3 ken. 297 tsubo remains. For the similar 3 ken, place the cube root 3, and with 3 × 9 as estimation, establish this next. For the three-way corner portion, match 3 ken with the estimation 9, subtracting and showing 3 × 9 = 270 tsubo.

For the small corner, square 3 ken to get 3 × 3 = 9, match with cube root 3, and subtract 3 × 9 = 27 tsubo.

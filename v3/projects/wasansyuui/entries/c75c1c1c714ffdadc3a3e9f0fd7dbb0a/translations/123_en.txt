《Title: Square Root Estimation Method》
　　▲Square Root Method Estimation
Sun-bu: 272 bu 2 fun 5 rin
　　Finding the square root - asking what amount this becomes
　Square shaku: 1 shaku 6 sun 5 fun

The method: Place 272 bu 2 fun 5 rin as the base number, examine the place value, and establish the standard that 1 shaku square equals 100 bu. Taking one advance of one advance, subtract 100 bu to get 1 shaku, leaving 172 bu 5 rin.
When adding from the base 1 shaku to two directions, use this principle and set 1, 2 as the estimation guide. Using this estimation of 2, divide the remaining 172 bu 2 fun 5 rin by 2, and dividing as 5, 2 advances of one advance gives 6 sun. Adding 60 bu to each direction and subtracting 120 bu for both directions leaves 52 bu 2 fun 5 rin.

Pay careful attention to where the provisional values are added and where the small squares are subtracted, and recalculate accordingly. The provisional values work as follows: sometimes the initial provisional value of 20 has the subsequent 10 added to make 30. There are also calculations where 10 is added next to 20. In subtracting small squares, beginners should carefully examine the subtraction of 10 bu and the subtraction of 1 bu, and calculate well.

From then on, the old man and his daughter carried the basket on their backs and returned home. When they opened it to see what was inside, they found not only gold and silver, but also an invisibility cloak, an invisibility hat, a magic mallet, and various other treasures. They rejoiced at this unexpected fortune and lived prosperously.

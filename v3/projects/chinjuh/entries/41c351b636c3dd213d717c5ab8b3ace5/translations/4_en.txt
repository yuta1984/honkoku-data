【Right page】
Once upon a time, there lived an honest old man. He had an only daughter, and they kept a sparrow, giving it food morning and evening. Before long, they were letting it roam freely. This sparrow had come to the old man's garden when its parent sparrow brought its fledgling, but when being chased by a crow and trying to escape, it was accidentally injured by the crow and could not fly. Taking pity on it, they cared for it.

Old man: "Well now, you've become quite a settled sparrow."

The honest old man's

【Left page】
neighbor was a greedy and avaricious, stubborn woman who knew no compassion—a mean-spirited old hag. When she had put out starch by the well to starch her laundry, the free-roaming sparrow licked up all the starch. The old woman became very angry, caught the sparrow, cut its tongue, and let it go.

♪"Oh my, how pitiful"

♪"That wretch licked up all eight mon worth of starch! If it were Lord Taro's dog, I'd give it oil cake, but a sparrow—what a detestable creature!"

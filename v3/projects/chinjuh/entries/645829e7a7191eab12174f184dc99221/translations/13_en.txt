Asahina had brought eight foreigners intending to make money from them, but unexpectedly, the expenses of the long journey, Tenaga-shima's troublemaking, and daily miscellaneous costs resulted in great losses. Seeing this as pitiful even from his small heart, Kojin-shima set up a street stall in Yukinoshita, Kamakura, where he sold fine calligraphy - writing the many thousands of Sanjusangendo temple on rice grains, the six-character sacred formula on millet grains, five-character Chinese poems on green beans, and compositions like the Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets on one-inch square papers. This became the talk of all Kamakura as something rare and wonderful, earning considerable money and somewhat offsetting Asahina's losses. How kind of him.

【Asahina's dialogue】
"Fine calligraphy - whatever you prefer, I can have it written."

【Dialogue of people coming to have fine calligraphy written by Kojin-shima】
"The divine blessing of Hachiman-sama seems to have turned out very well, hasn't it?"

"The Kojin-shima who appeared at the confectionery shop in Fukiya-cho the year before last - they say this is his wife."

"How remarkable this is!"

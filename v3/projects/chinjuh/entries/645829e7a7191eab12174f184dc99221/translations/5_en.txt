Asahina soon arrived in Kamakura, and being essentially a showman【performer】, he devised various ways to entertainingly use these eight foreigners as one might expect on the road. First, he stripped the person from the country with holes in their chest naked, dressed him in a kebiishi's straw mat, poured sake from his mouth, attached a drinking spout to the hole in his chest, and used him as a substitute for a sake barrel.

A kyōka poem:
♪When I want to open and show my heart, even an island with holes in the chest becomes dear to me. This brings to mind such verses.

【Asahina's dialogue】
"While Sukeroku's crude talk includes rowing a pleasure boat into someone's nostril, using a belly hole as a drinking spout is something new, indeed!"

【Long-Armed Islander's dialogue】
"Master, this is a brilliant idea!"

【Person from the Chest-Piercing Country's dialogue】
"Ah, this is such a painful duty!"

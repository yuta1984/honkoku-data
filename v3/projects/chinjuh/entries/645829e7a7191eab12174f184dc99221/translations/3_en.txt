Now, Sennen Saji-bei had traveled around Shikoku and become a monkey, while Kobayashi no Asahina had traveled around foreign countries and become a monkey-bear. Even now their names are known, and on a spring day when he flexes his strength-boasting elbows like the crane feathers depicted together in Edo's kabuki "Gabusu-hō," he thinks deeply: "If I were to cross over to foreign countries once more and bring back foreigners one by one to Japan, it would make a truly fine spectacle. This would be the newest attraction." With this thought constantly in mind, he made his preparations.

　　Yet fools get up and work

　♪Using a barrel as a pillow,
　　Asahina slept soundly,
　　　snoring away

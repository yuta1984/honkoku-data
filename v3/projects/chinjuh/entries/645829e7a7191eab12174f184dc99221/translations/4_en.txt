Thus Asahina crossed over to foreign countries once again, brought back foreigners one by one, and soon returned to Japan. These foreigners were from "Giant Country," "Dwarf Island," "Tall Island," "Long-Armed Island," "Women's Island," "Black Woman," and "穿胸国 (Senkyō-koku)" - a country of people with holes in their bellies - eight people in total. Strange and marvelous, they first arrived at Nagasaki and hurried toward Kamakura.

For some reason, Asahina dressed the woman from Women's Island and the black woman in Japanese costume when he brought them. It seems that Asahina, being well-versed in kusazōshi picture books, did this out of consideration to make the illustrations more interesting.

♪The Dwarf Islander says: "Hey, Giant Country person, please walk a little apart from us. Even though I shout loudly that you look terribly small, to the Giant Country person's ears it sounds like a mosquito's buzz and can't be heard at all."

The Giant Country person says: "I'm talking about Man'ya. Everyone can see, but to me, I can already see Kamakura."

The Tall Islander says: "Since I'm accompanying you, there's no worry about river closures."

"The place where you and I have come together like this is like Kasamori's rice dumplings and dirt dumplings."

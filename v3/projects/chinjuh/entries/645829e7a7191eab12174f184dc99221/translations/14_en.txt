Inspired by Kojin-shima's fine calligraphy, Asahina instructed the Giant Country people to create printed materials with large stone script and standard script on hundred-tatami-sized paper, distributing them throughout Kamakura. One day in the garden of Kenchoji Temple, he had them write the character "ga" (elegant) from "fuuga" (refined elegance) filling an entire hundred-tatami-sized paper. This became highly acclaimed throughout Kamakura, with everyone coming to see it. Asahina earned considerable fees from the spectators, finally recovering his losses.

【Spectators' dialogue】
"This is certainly not human work. Even the Great Buddha couldn't match this!"

"Bravo, bravo! But this is somewhat like praising a shamisen."

"If this is his own calligraphic style, well, what of it?"

While Women's Island and Asahina were sitting face-to-face having a serious conversation, a south wind began to blow, causing Women's Island to feel unwell and collapse like melting candy, troubling Asahina.

♪"Hey Asahina, if you would do something for me, I would be grateful. The long naginata of the nageshi, spinning my waist and body like a waterwheel! Really, are you demon or human?"

♪"I heard in the Sansai Zue that 'in the Land of Women, if the south wind touches naked skin, one becomes pregnant,' but I thought it wouldn't be to this extent - what an unbearable thing to witness!"

♪"How embarrassing, but this is the first time since birth I've heard such suggestive words."

【Asahina's dialogue】
♪"You fool! I'm likely to be blown away by such presumptuous breath!"

♪"Ah, it stinks, it stinks!"

♪"Forgive me!"

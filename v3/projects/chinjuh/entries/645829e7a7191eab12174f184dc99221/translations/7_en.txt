The people from Women's Island could be used even in ponds, but the troublesome ones that are tough even when crushed are the black women. While thinking there must surely be some method, recently using the Dutch-imported washing powder that had been advertised everywhere, miraculously, like the moon appearing in a dark night, like Urashima opening the treasure box, like the indigo dyer's hakama and the flour merchant's mice, she instantly turned white.

♪"It's as if she was reborn - such a state isn't bad at all!"

【Black woman's dialogue】
"Don't praise me so much. It might just be a dream."

♪"Well, well!" - what beautiful scraps, so pretty, so pretty.

Since Long-Armed Islander loved alcohol, one night when Asahina was away, he took advantage of the opportunity and, seeing that the sake barrel was fast asleep, crept from the inner parlor to the sake room and twisted the spout. The barrel suddenly woke up and, thinking "how hateful," pressed down on the drinking spout. Just then, needing to urinate, he pretended it was sake and filled the tea bowl with urine. Long-Armed Islander, unaware, thinking the urine was sake, gulped it down - what a pleasant feeling!

【Sake barrel (i.e., Chest-Piercing Country)'s dialogue】
♪"Lately I have a bit of a fever, so it's the color of aged sake, this urine."

Someone said:
The sound of sake pouring is "glug glug."
The sound of urine coming out is "splash splash."
Thinking about it, that line from the song "escaping the serpent's mouth" - could this be what it refers to?

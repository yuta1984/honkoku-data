Asahina knew that Tenaga-shima had thieving tendencies and, fearing future troubles, thought to send him back to his country. However, since it was a long journey, he couldn't send him back empty-handed, so he gave him a reasonable amount of travel money and promptly drove him out of the house. This was the beginning of severance pay. Also, calling thieves "long-handed" began from this time.

Was it yesterday or today?
　Arms, oh left arm,
Right arm, without arms
to strike with,
how regrettable it is.

【Tenaga-shima's dialogue】
Ah, how shameful!
Now I have awakened.
Having long hands
is inferior to having
a long philtrum
(the area under the nose).
Ah,
in this world
where arms are
　　like
enemies,
even to scratch
my head,
　　my hands
are too heavy
　　　to
do so.

【Ashinaga-shima's dialogue】
Hey, Kuro-san,
in your
expression
　　there's
　a bit of
　　Kitayama
　　winter rain.

【Asahina, speaking to Tenaga-shima】
Not even for a moment
can I let you stay.
Take this and
get out.

【The black woman's dialogue】
Don't call me such an
unpleasant "black woman."
That was in the old days!

The black woman
has now become
a beautiful
white person
and acts somewhat refined.

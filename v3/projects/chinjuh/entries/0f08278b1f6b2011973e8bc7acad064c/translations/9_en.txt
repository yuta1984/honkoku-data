Here, Lady Tomoe fought against great numbers in a memorial battle for Yoshinaka, and no one could approach her.

Here, Wada Yoshimori finally captured Lady Tomoe alive and returned to Kamakura in triumph.

Now that Lord Kiso had perished, everyone raised victory cries and returned to Kamakura in triumph.

Wada Yoshimori was a compassionate warrior, and knowing that Lady Tomoe was pregnant, he petitioned the Lord of Kamakura and made her his wife.

[Dialogue of the samurai restraining Lady Tomoe]
"She's a strong woman!"

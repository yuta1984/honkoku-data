"What painful remonstrance, Date! I shall become the sovereign lord of ten thousand chariots and destroy Yoritomo without any trouble or time required. Kanehira, from now you are banished! Stand up and begone!"

Alas, my lord, if this plot reaches Kamakura, will Yoritomo leave it be? He will send Yoshitsune and Kaba-dono to attack, and you will surely perish just like the Taira."

[Several lines are faded/illegible]

"Will you still not be silent? My... punishment... what will you do?"

"Take away the troublesome Kanehira!"

Flowers' Destined Bond

The destined bond of flowers
With the gods as matchmakers
I humbly ask you, my lord
At least for one night
Let me live to see it

Though I think it's a familiar matter
Truly, I am embarrassed, but
Everyone speaks reasonably
The one without reason is me alone
Saying "beloved" by myself
The evening bell tolls deeply

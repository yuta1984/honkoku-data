Again, one time
when he went to play
in the mountains,
there were leaf tengu
in a large cedar tree.
He shook the tree
and made them all fall down.

thought they ultimately couldn't win,
so rather than fight,
they submitted to Kintarō
and agreed to compete with him.

To the one who wins,
as a reward I'll give
leaf rice

dokkoi!
My nose gets

when trying to grab and eat—
having a nose
is troublesome!"

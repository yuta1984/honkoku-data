Long, long ago, as everyone is familiar with,
One of Raikō's Four Heavenly Kings,
A leader among the old brave warriors,
Bun-Sakata no Kintoki
Originally was born in
Mount Ashigara in Izu Province.
Having no father, his mother
Mated with a deity (shin)
And conceived, giving birth
After thirteen months of pregnancy.
When he was born,
Though he was a young child,
His form was enormous, and
As he grew,
His strength became extremely powerful.

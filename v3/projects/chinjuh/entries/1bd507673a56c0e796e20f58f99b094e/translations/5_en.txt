Among the beasts,
the bear is a fierce animal, so it once
confronted
Kintarō,
but

its strength was
no match at all, and it was
thrown about terribly.
From this time on, Kin-
tarō

rides on the bear,
making it run through
peaks and valleys, testing his skills.

Also, whenever
it goes against
his wishes,
he takes his
hatchet and
strikes its head
repeatedly, but the bear
apologizes
profusely.

♪"How strong I am!
I'm going to
ride on you now, so
run well. If you don't run,
it's the hatchet again!"

Seeing this situation,
those three companions thought they must
not let the old father
escape, so they aimed for his boat
and jumped
aboard.
Understanding the situation, the dog,
rabbit,
and sparrow
all together
helped,
and for a short
while

they grappled and fought,
but in the end the cat and tanuki
were quickly
beaten by the three companions.
The monkey, who had earlier been
severely
pinched by the crab,
was weakened
in body and
tried to
flee,
but the dog would not let him escape,
held him down,
and tied him up
with rope.

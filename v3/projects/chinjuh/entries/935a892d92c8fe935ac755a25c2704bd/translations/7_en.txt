One day, when Mizuemon
had some business and was
walking
alone,
the cat and
tanuki spotted
him and thought "Today
we'll finally get
that old man!" They hid
behind the Inamura
shadows, and when
the old man came
to that spot,
both of them
jumped out saying "Hey there,
old man, could you
lend us your reverse
grip for a moment?" and such,
so [the old man thought] to give their
skulls a good whack
with this stick, from left
and right

they closed in on him
and it already
looked
quite
dangerous
for him
when
unexpectedly
running to the scene
came
the old man's loyal
dog and rabbit. The moment
they saw this, they
pounced on
the cat and
tanuki, grabbed them and
threw them down,
caring for the old man. Meanwhile,
the cat and tanuki slunk away
holding their heads and wagging their tails,
　　escaping to who knows where.

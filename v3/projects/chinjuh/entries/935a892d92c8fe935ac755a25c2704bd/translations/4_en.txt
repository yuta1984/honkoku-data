The crab that was kept there had been watching the monkey steal persimmons. The monkey became greatly angered and said, "You bastard, you're probably going to tattle to the old man again!" While saying this, he grabbed a persimmon from above and hurled it at the crab's back. The crab's shell immediately cracked, causing great pain and suffering. Wrapping its body with a hand towel, the crab went to the old man, reported what had happened, and wept sorrowfully.

Old Mizuemon became greatly enraged, saying, "What a detestable monkey's doing! There have been various misdeeds until now. Conspiring with my pet cat, tormenting my precious sparrows, pilfering the goldfish from their bowl - in any case, his habit of stealing food won't be cured, he won't apply himself to the tricks I'm teaching him, and I can no longer bear it. He cannot remain in my house!" With that, he told both the monkey and cat to leave together and disappear, beating both the monkey and cat severely with his tobacco pipe.

The cat and monkey had always been on bad terms. The pet dog, who had long felt he couldn't just stand by and watch his fellow animals' troubles, came before the master and pleaded in various ways for the two animals. However, the old man would not listen at all and finally drove them out.

The dog, having no other recourse, took out some money he had saved up and divided it between the two animals - truly this was a dog with a noble spirit. Thus the old man tended to the crab, gave it medicine, applied medicinal plaster, and had it rest to heal its wounds.

When the old man saw this terrible scene,
he flew into a great rage
and ran out, but the cat and
tanuki scurried away
swiftly on quick feet, instantly
escaping somewhere,
so the old man had no choice
but to return home.
Lamenting that he had lost
his treasured sparrow,
he grieved and sorrowed deeply.
The dog and rabbit
he kept, being animals
with good hearts,
heard the circumstances and
joined in his grief, and angrily said:
"That cat's actions are truly detestable.
Now we two
will work together
to make those villains suffer
and ease our master's anger."

The dog took up the scissors
that had cut
the sparrow's tongue
and said: "Listen, old man,
these scissors are
not Yuranosuke
from the loyal retainers'
story, but they are
a memento of the sparrow
whose tongue was
cut. I will keep
these scissors
and wait for the right moment.
After we capture the sparrow's
enemies together with the rabbit,
we'll clip their ears, noses, whatever
　　we can grab,
　　　　　　cutting and snipping to
　　　　　　　　ease your troubled heart,"
　　　　　　　　　　　he declared most
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　reassuringly.

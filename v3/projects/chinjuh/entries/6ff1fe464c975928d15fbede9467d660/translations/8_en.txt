The magistrate of the mansion has defeated the Wada clan and feels great satisfaction. Indeed, this demon-like strong 93-year-old man achieved a complete victory through his scheming.

In the battle, regarding Yoshimori and Asahina's matter, while I was fiercely attacking them, they regrettably escaped. I humbly request a generous reward for my efforts.

Although I failed to kill the main commander and my military achievements may seem diminished, the quick conclusion of the battle was indeed a great accomplishment of recent times.

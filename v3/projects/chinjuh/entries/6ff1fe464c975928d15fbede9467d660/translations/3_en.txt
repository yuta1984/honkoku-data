Date no Kagenobu resolves to destroy the Wada clan.

【Date Kagenobu's dialogue】
Strike them down!

This was in early May of the first year of Kenpō era. The Wada clan, having been slandered by false accusers, reluctantly took up arms to defend themselves against the shogunal forces.

Wada's third son, Asahina of Kobayashi, wielded his iron club and charged into the large enemy force. Though they tried to take advantage of this to strike him down, the attacking forces struggled and retreated.

【Dialogue】
This is troublesome, but it can't be helped.

【Warrior observing from behind the fence】
Itagi yoshi, yoshi【？？？】

【Person aiming with arquebus】
Now then, I'm going to shoot! I'm going to fire!

【Person being struck on the head with an iron club】
Namu Sanpō, my head has been dented somehow. It hurts, it hurts!

【The person wielding the iron club (Asahina)】
I'll beat you all to death at once! Heiya, unto, naa, mosa!

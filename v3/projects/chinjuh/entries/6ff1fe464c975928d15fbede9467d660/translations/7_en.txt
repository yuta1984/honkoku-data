Asahina, having lost his father Yoshimori, was weeping in grief and resentment when Arai no Tōta came with a large force, intending to take Yoshimori's head as proof of his death. However, he was killed by Asahina.

"Ah, how painful, how painful!"

【Asahina's dialogue】
"I beat him to death with an iron rod!"

Artist: Tomikawa Ginsetsu

【From here begins the middle volume】
Kobayashi no Asahina, exhausted from battle, stopped at a certain sake shop and had four or five cups of Ōsaka-tsuki (a brand of sake).
"Ah, delicious, delicious!"

The sake shop owner: "Nervously pouring sake. What fine drinking you display, sir!"

"You seem quite intoxicated. I too am a fellow who suffers pain, you know."

When Tomoe Gozen was
with child,
in order to raise the child
as a proper person,
following Wada no
Yoshimori,
after fifteen
months,
she gave birth
easily.
This was
Asaina no Saburō Yoshihide.

Asaina was born
with great strength
and brilliant wisdom.

With his loyal
and devoted heart
stirring up exciting
deeds,
he studied
military arts
and becoming
a true
hero
was
as easy as
(holding something)
in the palm of his hand.

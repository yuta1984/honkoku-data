The person from Pygmy Island, being a curiosity in Japan, was walking around looking at the surroundings when a great wind blew, lifted them up into the void, and blew them down into a well in the back. Asaina panicked, thinking it wouldn't be amusing to lose such an important commodity, and though he wanted to rescue them, he had no immediate means to do so. At this moment, the person from Long-Armed Island said, "Here is where I show my skill," and without any fuss, bared one shoulder, extended his hand into the well, and pulled him out effortlessly. At this time, everyone without exception was impressed by the person from Long-Armed Island.

Asaina soon arrived in Kamakura, but since this was like a parade of demons and spirits, he pondered various ways to make interesting use of these eight people's arrangements for what might happen on the road. First, he stripped the person from the country with holes in their chest naked, dressed them in a kebiishi's (imperial police) straw mat, poured sake from their mouth, attached a drinking spout to the hole in their chest, and used them as a substitute for a sake barrel.

This brings to mind the kyōka (comic poem):
〽When I wish to open and show my heart, I long for that island with holes in the chest.

【Asaina's dialogue】
"Rowing a pleasure boat into a nostril" is mentioned in Sukeroku's abuse, but using a belly hole as a drinking spout is novel indeed.

【Person from Long-Armed Island's dialogue】
Boss, this is a brilliant plan.

【Person from Senkyōkoku's dialogue】
Ah, this is a painful duty.

One day, while crossing a bridge called Shian-bashi (Contemplation Bridge), the good head wanted to go to temple worship, while the evil head wanted to go have fun at the pleasure quarters. With two minds but one body, going back and forth, the heart was confused and lost in contemplation, pulling each other with cries of "heave-ho!" In the contest of strength, the good head's sinews seemed stronger, and finally pacified the evil head and went to temple worship.

The good head said:
"If you indulge too much in pleasures when young, you will suffer when you grow old. Stop this behavior."

The evil head said:
"What! Human life is only fifty years. Sometimes one must refresh one's spirit."

One time, when the good head was dozing a little, the evil head immediately opened his eyes wide like saucers and said "this is a good opportunity," invited his friends to go to a sake house and drank sake. But over drinks he started a fight with his friends, and they beat and struck each other in conflict.

The evil head became greatly enraged and evil thoughts arose more and more, but the good head was sleeping peacefully and knew nothing of this disturbance. After the sake had completely worn off, he woke up and greatly regretted it.

"When told that I'm thought of as nothing, my manhood cannot stand it."

"Oh no, don't do this again. If only the good head had awakened earlier, this would have been better."

Preface to "The Double-Headed Brush Diary of Good and Evil"

The tobokkiki is a two-headed beast, and the meimeichō is a double-headed bird. Shukugō buried a two-headed snake, and Sōgyoku composed poetry about parallel-headed lotus flowers. Kōshuku's two-eared rice, Ōshun's two-stemmed melons—all of these seem to be heavenly mechanisms that show good and evil fortune. Indeed, the existence of good and evil, righteousness and wickedness in the human heart is like having two heads on one body. When one tries to advance good, evil obstructs it; when evil tries to run, good cannot stop it. Therefore, even if one performs small good deeds in front, committing great evil afterward is the normal state of human nature. As Takuan's verse says:
"Behind the sutra reading, the mosquito incense of the asura realm"
If one were to paint a picture of a person with one body but two hearts, it would be an ugly form, just like two-headed, double-necked birds and beasts.

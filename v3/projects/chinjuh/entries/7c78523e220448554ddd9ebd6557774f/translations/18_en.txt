Thus, the evil head saw that dream and for the first time realized the magnitude of his heart's sins, and decided to repent and receive the teachings of the holy man.

At that time, there was a virtuous person called Chinki Dōjin (Demon-Subduing Holy Man). He taught the two heads, saying: "The twenty-fourth volume of the 'Giso Rokujō' states: 'A dog looked into a well, saw its own shadow reflected in the water, became angry, tried to fight with it, and finally fell into the well and died. This happened because it thought "I exist."'" And so on. All people, because they think "I exist," torment their own hearts and bodies throughout their lives.

That dog seeing its own reflection in the water, becoming angry, and losing its life is a parable of having two hearts in one body. Your two heads fighting each other is also the same as this. From now on, abandon evil and advance only toward good." Saying this, he struck the evil head with a magic mallet, and the spot became a large bump.

The evil head, struck by the small mallet, developed a bump at that spot, which later withered gradually like a wilting flower, finally crumbling to dust and falling away. Only the good head remained, and he became an ordinary person.

【Good head's dialogue】
"Through 'ni-ichi tensaku no go-iken' [a Buddhist calculation method], I have realized that one body with two hearts..."

【Chinki Dōjin's dialogue】
"People of the world will see your appearance and laugh at you as a cripple, but if one were to draw a picture of the heart of a person who has two hearts in one body, it would be a cripple like you. There is merely the constant alternation between revealing and concealing. This invisible cloak and invisible hat are treasures that hide the demon's horns and conceal the self that thinks 'I exist.'"

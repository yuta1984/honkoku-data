Long, long ago, in some country or other, there lived a merchant called Yamagawaya Momoremon (Peach Right Guard). This Momoremon was over forty years old but had no children, and he spent his days lamenting this fact. One day his wife was passing by the banks of a river called Sentaku River when she spotted a peach floating downstream. She picked it up and found that it was a single stem bearing two peach fruits. Without waiting for another to float by, she took it home, and when the couple ate this peach together, they found that one peach was sweet in flavor while the other was bitter. After eating them, the couple thought it strange that not only did two fruits grow on one stem, but that their flavors were so different—truly a mysterious thing.

【Momoremon's dialogue】
"That's like something from an old tale! For peaches to ripen in this cold season is indeed strange. Most likely it's a peach dropped by the Queen Mother of the West."

【Wife's dialogue】
"Today I picked up such an unusual peach. Two fruits have grown on a single stem."

leading them close to provide divine welcome. Though it was a mysterious occurrence, it was truly a most blessed example. Without doubt, Shinemon would achieve rebirth in the Pure Land paradise ten billion lands to the west, and his attainment of the highest grade of the nine levels of paradise was as clear as looking at one's own palm. Everyone was overcome with emotion. Thus the elderly samurai near the end of life and the inexperienced young men looked up to heaven, prostrated themselves on the ground, and went mad with the desire to die together with him. This too seemed the ultimate reason. Among them, his eldest son approached Shinemon's bedside, wrapping his tears in his sleeve, and said, "Please look here. Please feel confident and achieve a safe rebirth," pointing with his finger as he spoke. At that moment, Chikamasa suddenly opened his sleeping eyes wide, stared intently at his son, and said, "Listen, one who is born into a house of archery and horsemanship should never forget the bow and arrow, even if he reaches the Pure Land and sits upon a lotus throne of the nine grades. Bring me the shigetō lacquered quiver with arrows from where it stands on the tokonoma in the study." There was no one who heard this who was not astonished. Wondering what this could mean, they watched as Chikamasa—though no one knew exactly how strong his archery was, it seemed it must be quite powerful—took up his bow, drew it back fully, held it steady for a moment, and released it with a sharp sound. Without missing, he shot through the chest of Amida Buddha, who stood emanating light as the central figure of the three sacred beings, piercing through from one side to the other. The purple cloud formations that had filled the void and all the holy beings vanished instantly without a trace.

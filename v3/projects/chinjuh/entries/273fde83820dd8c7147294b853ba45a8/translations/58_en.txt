This is the story. When they investigated thoroughly to understand what had happened, they discovered that an old badger that had lived there for many years had transformed itself and was conducting the Buddhist ceremony. This was truly a rare occurrence. Finally, he composed a death poem and recited:

"If one dies at the dawn of being born,
This evening the autumn wind blows"

Reciting thus, he passed away. How wondrous! Having attained the profound mystery of emptiness and quietude, dispelling obstructive hindrances, though his body entered the gate of death, he awakened the sleep of the living—this is what the people of the world consider a marvel. Afterward, they requested Ikkyu to serve as the guiding priest and asked for his guidance in the funeral service. Ikkyu too thought he should provide an unusual kind of guidance for this Shinemon, and was devising something special.

Soon they came carrying Shinemon's corpse on a palanquin. When Ikkyu stepped forward and struck the coffin in which Shinemon was lying, the supposedly dead man spoke in a clear voice and addressed a poem to Ikkyu. This was indeed mysterious, and people have said that Shinemon could not have been an ordinary person—this story is passed down even to this day. The poem went:

"Coming alone and returning alone is also myself—
How amusing to speak of teaching the Way!"

When he chanted this clearly, before those words had even finished, Ikkyu graciously composed a reply poem:

"Coming alone and returning alone is also delusion"

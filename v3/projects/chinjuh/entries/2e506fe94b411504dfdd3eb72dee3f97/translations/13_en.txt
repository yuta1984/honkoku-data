"How compassionate," the Master thought, and asked "What do you wish for now?" Emon Saburō humbly replied: "It is unbearable for me to become a servant of the Kōno clan, fetching wood and drawing water, so please let me be born as Lord Kōno himself." Thinking to make this a story for future generations, the Master transformed his appearance at the foot of Mount Shōsan Temple in Awa Province, and at the age of three, was reborn into the Kōno family without doubt. Looking at his left hand, he held a stone one sun and eight bu in size, with "Namu Daishi Henjō Kongō" on the front, and on the back "The former Emon Saburō reborn into the Kōno family" - this was undoubtedly true.

From this began the Twelve Shrine Manifestations. Those who complete the pilgrimage once, even if they have committed the ten evils and five grave sins, are equivalent to those who have visited Mount Kōya thirty-three times. If those who complete the pilgrimage once were to fall into hell, then King Enma and the Ten Kings would fall first before us and drop them afterward - such is his sacred vow. Those who provide lodging for one night to pilgrims, correctly show them the way, and offer hospitality shall surely attain Buddhahood in the Pure Land.

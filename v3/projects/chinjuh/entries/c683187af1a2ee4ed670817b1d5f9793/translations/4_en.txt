The ghost and the demon spirit grew closer in their conversations day by day, and finally she became pregnant. When the tenth month came, she gave birth easily and safely, but the child was not what you would call a jewel-like human child. The demon spirit was greatly surprised - having a demon child with such a normal appearance would be bad for his reputation. Unless the nose were attached upside down, or the mouth split all the way to the ears, it wouldn't be called deformed. That such a normal child was born was indeed the way of karma.

This was because this demon spirit had never devoured humans until now, and had never committed any acts of killing, so as a reward for this, he was blessed with a properly formed son. Worried about becoming a laughingstock among his demon peers, he spent his days in anguish over what to do.

"What a strangely handsome, jewel-like child you've given birth to!" he cried.

"Hey, keep your voice down - this is embarrassing and bad for our reputation!"

"The karma of parents who don't kill has manifested in their child - born with all thirty-two divine marks complete, without a single flaw anywhere. Perhaps to atone for this child's sins, we should put him in a sideshow. Maybe next time around, a rokurokubi will be born instead. Since the normal child is beloved, we certainly can't abandon him - how pitiful this is!"

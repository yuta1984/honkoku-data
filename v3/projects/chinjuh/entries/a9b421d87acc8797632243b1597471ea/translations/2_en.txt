Preface

Year after year, counting the number of New Year's pine decorations as time passes, and having lived a long life, the "Mikooshi Nyudo" (Peering Monk) stretches his neck and calls out "Mungwa~, Ikku-don."

"Mikoshi": "Happy New Year!"
"Ikku": "Well, well now!" And taking out a kusazoshi picture book manuscript from his pocket,
"What a good idea, how enviable!"
"Mikoshi": "I too have put together something with a little twist this year, but what do you think?"
"Ikku": "Let me see, let me see... Ah, Chushingura! This is interesting. Let me have a look first," and so on.

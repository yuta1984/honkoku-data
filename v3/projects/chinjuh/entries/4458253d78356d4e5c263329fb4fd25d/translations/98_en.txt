【On Ikkyu's Final Death Poem】
『Thirteen』
The final verses attributed to Master Ikkyu that have become popular among the people are numerous. Saying "this is true" or "this is not true" is also untrue. Why? Because when people painted his portrait and requested inscriptions, and others also requested inscriptions, he would write whatever came to mind for those inscriptions. One inscription he wrote on a portrait was:

　　Obscurely for thirty years, plainly for thirty years
　　Obscurely and plainly for sixty years
　　At the end, I offer shit to Brahma

There is also this verse, and in another saying:

　　I borrowed yesterday of last month
　　I repay today of this month  
　　Of the five things I borrowed, I return four
　　Now I return to the original emptiness

Also, what people say he wrote as his final words:

　　Living and dying, dying and living
　Willows are green, flowers are red
　　　Katsu! (Zen shout)
　Willows are not green, flowers are not red - Be careful! Be careful! Ikkyu's inscription

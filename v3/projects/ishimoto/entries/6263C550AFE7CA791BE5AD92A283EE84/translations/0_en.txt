Kōei 7th year, kinoe-tora, 4th month, 6th day - Fire broke out at noon
《Kamigyō Fire Disaster》 Record of losses of townhouses' miscellaneous goods
Next day, 7th, at the hour of the Rabbit - Fire extinguished, lasting 9 hours day and night

【Content】
○Number of districts: approximately 215 districts - District gates and Shinto ritual implements
　50 ryō of gold per district
　　This amounts to 10,750 ryō of gold

　　60 ryō of gold per house

However, shrines, temples, and samurai residences are difficult to calculate,
so recording only townhouses, averaging large and small houses for miscellaneous goods
losses follows the proverb "even dust accumulates into a mountain" -
even old wooden clogs and straw sandals amount to
high costs, so this estimate is made to encourage caution with fire.

Storehouses: approximately 1,873 locations
　　　　941 locations burned
Buddhist altars, folding screens, hanging scrolls, short swords, tea utensils, furniture, large implements,
chests of drawers, long chests, pots and kettles, and other ceramics -
these are too extensive to calculate, so
they should be recorded as beyond this monetary amount.

This sum of money turned to ashes in merely 9 hours - truly a fearsome thing!
Therefore, always be careful with fire, never be careless. Even a small tobacco
ember can become the foundation of ten thousand people's grief. Time and again, day and night,
never be careless even for a moment. Caution should be the first priority. Moreover, gradually returning to
original residences will require double or triple the expense, as one should know.

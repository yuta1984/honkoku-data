Craftsman's child:
"I'm apologizing now, so please forgive me!"

Earthquake's child:
"Please forgive me already!"

Child:
"This guy! He caught my father's foot in a needle - knock him down from the shelf and kill him!"

Cowardly earthquake:
"Oh no! If this guy turns me into kabayaki (grilled eel), it'll be terrible! Run, run!"

Neighborhood samurai:
"How frustrating, how terrible! Ah, what a pity I didn't flee at once!"

Rich man:
"Oh my, this is terrible! If I had known this would happen, I should have spent it all earlier!"

Prostitute:
"It's dangerous, so please come quickly!"

Blind masseur:
"Damn it! You ate my loincloth, didn't you!"
"How about some fresh catfish kabayaki?"

Thunder god:
"Catfish, what tremendous work you've done! Indeed, even I cannot match you. But you detestable creature, I must ensure you never come to this country again!"

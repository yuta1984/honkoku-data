(First Section)
1. The tsunami disaster in Hokuriku is so terrible one cannot bear to look; parents and children separated from each other - perhaps this too is the fate of previous lives
1. The houses and storehouses inherited from parents were destroyed by the earthquake; how desperate we are - this too is a natural disaster from heaven
1. After the earthquake came the great tsunami, and while we were still in shock, fires broke out; there is no will to live - truly a great calamity
1. The treasures and lands passed down through generations were swept away; with nowhere to turn, we pray for rescue to come quickly
1. The three prefectures that suffered this disaster will be talked about for generations to come; how pitiful to hear of Aomori, Iwate, and Miyagi prefectures
1. The great tsunami that came all at once - we could neither flee nor retreat; with hearts pounding, the sound of waves thundered in our chests
1. Speaking and hearing of it brings only tears; the deaths from this tsunami, together with the injured, number over sixty thousand - truly a terrible tragedy
1. The fishermen who escaped certain death and saved their lives were fortunate; this blessing amid misfortune came from heaven's mercy

(Second Section)
1. The people afflicted by disaster have no means of making a living; the relief rice from the benevolent government brings tears of gratitude
1. People from prefectures and cities rushed about in all directions; volunteers collected and donated relief funds

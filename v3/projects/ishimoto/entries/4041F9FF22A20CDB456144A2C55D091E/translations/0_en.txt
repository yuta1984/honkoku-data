New Edition: Earthquake Puns

【Upper section from right:】
Places with earthquakes, tsunamis, and fires
are truly narrow escapes from death

An earthquake came during mealtime
fled to Kuwazu, standing in Echizen

During earthquakes, no matter what
people eat in panic

Shikoku region too, increasingly
severe in Tosa

Even the theaters of Dotonbori
had terrible experiences in Osaka

Because it shakes so frequently
earthquakes are like parents in Kanto

【Lower section from right:】
Shimoda town with tsunami
where no people remain

With earthquakes and fires
the whole household in great turmoil

With earthquakes and tsunamis at Numazu
what can one do at Kuwazu

It should burn from earthquakes
the country called Enshu

Kuma-no-ura also had tsunami
so I heard

If this continues so frequently
no Shinshu can endure it

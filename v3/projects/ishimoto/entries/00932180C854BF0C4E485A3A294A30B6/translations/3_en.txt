It was the 24th day of the third month of Kōka 4, year of the Fire Sheep (1847), a clear and warm day when all was peaceful. That night, around the hour of the Boar (around 10 PM), a great earthquake struck the seven districts of Shinano Province with thunder-like roaring. Houses in the castle town and rural towns collapsed instantly, fires broke out in various places, and tens of thousands died from burns and crushing.

At the same time, in the Sai River area of Sarashina District—at Yamahirabayashi, Iwakura, Magose-yama, Sakurai, and Kokūzō-yama—an area about sixty jō high and twenty chō wide collapsed and was pushed into the Sai River, burying and blocking the river width, stopping the flow of water. Water accumulated, spreading upstream like a lake. The Tanba Island ferry crossing dried up and became like dry land, allowing people to cross on foot without wetting their heels. Mountains and even flatlands shook elsewhere, creating places difficult to traverse.

Furthermore, mountain valleys collapsed in several locations, blocking water flow. If the water that had accumulated for days were to burst through all at once, houses downstream would suffer flood damage beyond measure. Therefore, the authorities prepared signal fires at various locations to announce when the water would break through.

On the 13th day of the fourth month, during the late hour of the Monkey (around 4 PM), water suddenly burst out. Waves rose several dozen jō high, and the sound of water roared like thunder across heaven and earth, as if great mountains were collapsing. The entire sky became like clouds and mist, and though signal fires were attempted, black and white could not be distinguished. From Kawanakajima to the Chikuma River and Echigo Province, all houses were swept away, and the number of drowning victims was beyond counting.

According to the Fusō Ryakki, on the last day of the seventh month of Ninwa 3, year of the Fire Sheep (887), during Emperor Kōkō's reign, there was a great earthquake in six districts of Shinano Province. Great mountains collapsed, and castles, Buddhist temples, fields, men, women, cattle, and horses were all swept away and piled up like hills. From Ninwa 3 (887) to Kōka 4 (1847)—961 years—we witness a similar natural disaster again. Not only people of this province, but also travelers from various provinces who had come for the opening of the Zenkō-ji Nyorai temple died in great numbers. Alas, was this fate? What a strange calamity!

However, the main hall of Zenkō-ji Nyorai remained unharmed, and not one person who kept vigil there that night was injured. This was a manifestation of Buddhist virtue, a truly grateful thing. The miraculous responses are too numerous to recount individually. Truly this is a sacred Buddha without equal in the three countries, who should be revered and believed in. It is difficult to write freely as the brush moves, so I record only the outline. Please forgive any inadequacies, you who read this.

Long ago, on the 24th day of the 3rd month of Kōka 4, year of the Fire Sheep (1847), it was a clear, warm, and peaceful day. That night, around the hour of the Boar (around 10 PM), a great earthquake struck the seven districts of Shinano Province with a sound like thunder. The castle town and rural town houses collapsed instantly, fires broke out in various places, and tens of thousands died from burning or immediate impact. At the same time, along the Sai River in Sarashina District, an area of Yamahirabayashi, Iwakura, Magose-yama, Sakurai, and Kokūzō-yama—measuring over 60 jō in height and about 11 chō in width—collapsed and slid into the Sai River, burying and blocking the river channel and damming the flow. Water accumulated upstream, forming a lake, while the Tanba-Toriyama ferry crossing dried up and became like dry land. [This is being copied in frame 4, so refer to frame 4]

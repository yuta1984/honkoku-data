Brief Record of Hot Springs

There is a hot spring in the government forest of Hiyeyama, Kitayama Village, Suwa District, Shinano Province, Nagano Prefecture. Since the Shinshu region is traversed by volcanic mountain ranges, there are many hot springs throughout the area. Among them, this mineral spring at Hiyeyama was tested and analyzed by German Doctor Martin in the 10th year of Meiji (1877), and was found to contain potassium aluminum sulfate, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride, and potassium chloride. Its therapeutic effects include:

○ Skin rashes ○ Small sores ○ Stubborn ringworm ○ Chronic intractable ulcers ○ Syphilitic bone pain
○ Scrofula (lymphatic tuberculosis) ○ Infantile malnutrition ○ Otorrhea (ear discharge) ○ Scrofulous chronic keratitis
○ Eyelid ulcers ○ Rheumatism ○ Rickets ○ Paralysis
○ Susceptibility to colds ○ Leucorrhea ○ Menstrual irregularities

It is effective in curing the above ailments, though the appropriate water temperature varies according to the symptoms. Since this mineral spring lacks adequate temperature (perhaps due to its name "Hiyeyama" meaning "cold mountain"), we heat and boil it to make it suitable for the human body. The bathing facilities are divided into three classes, offering both lukewarm and hot water according to guests' preferences, with accommodation fees kept reasonable and no negligent service. Therefore, from late spring when flowers begin to scatter through the peak summer retreat season until the deepening autumn moon, guests can enjoy the changing scenery of fields and mountains while bathing over many days. This will provide various miraculous effects beyond those listed above, and any illness will be completely cured, rivaling the famous hot springs of Atami, Hakone, Kusatsu, and Ikaho. We earnestly request your visit regardless of the distance.

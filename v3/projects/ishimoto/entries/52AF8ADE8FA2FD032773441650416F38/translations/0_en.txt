Right side:
In the chaos of the earthquake
Unable to get out in time from inside the storehouse
Found here and there in the thicket
Rolling out from houses into the main street

"Wealth destroys houses, while trades enrich the body" - thus
The promises made behind latticed windows vanish like smoke
Carrying clods of earth to temporary dwellings, making profits with large hoes
With sake and wood shavings, polished rice
Those who had reached the extremes of luxury in their storehouses
Now with daily plastering work
Cannot even afford proper medical treatment
To tremble so
Is pitiful
Yet also
Grateful
For the nation's
Blessings
We look up to

Even when shaken, this immovable reign
As a sign, even when bounced back

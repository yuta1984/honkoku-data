put their hands over
their precious parts
so they won't crack

resemble revolving mechanisms
turning in bamboo groves
like silent scenes

plasterers, and roofers—
afterwards they profit money
with smiling faces

and bitten by them
heart pounds, and below
things rise up

Tormented by dissolute sons
and attacked by earthquakes
even fathers
feel fear

Eleventh verse:
Taking a son-in-law for
the reluctant pottery shop daughter—
broken by earthquakes,
nothing can be done

The divine wind blowing from Kashima
is blessed indeed
the imperial reign is unshakeable
like the keystone

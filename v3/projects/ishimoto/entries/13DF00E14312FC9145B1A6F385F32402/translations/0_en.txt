"Hey, hey,
please beat
this guy for us!"

"Don't make us
suffer so terribly!"

"It serves him right!"

"Please, please,
have mercy, have mercy!"

"Let me beat him
too, won't you!"

Catfish:
"How could a catfish
of my caliber do
two nights' worth
of work?
Think about it
carefully!
Ouch!
Ahhhhh
Ahhhhh"

"Just when we needed it most,
even temporary housing
couldn't be built!
As revenge for that,
you won't move, so
get beaten!"

"I'm also
a catfish,
but it's not
me!
It's the wrong
catfish!
Ahhhhh"

"It doesn't matter
if it's not you -
get beaten up
plenty and then
go away!"

"Wait, wait,
please wait!
Thanks to him,
good things will
happen again too!
Be reasonable and
forgive him!"

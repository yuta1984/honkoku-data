The Earthquake Chaos

Late to escape from inside the storehouse
Searching here and there in the thickets  
Tumbling from homes into the main streets
Running out naked from inside the bath
Shopkeepers working in the smoke
Courtesans with blackened teeth in the ditches
Rain-soaked wanderers among the roof tiles
Straightening what's bent inside homes

Sucharaka poku-poku
Banzai-raku
Gura-gura

○ Poem by Emperor Jomei
When I see the reflection of the crescent moon in the salt spring,
Even wounds heal every seven days

○ Poem by Kazanin
The mist at the foot of Mount Arima-Fuji resembles the sea,
What sounds like waves is the pine wind of Ono

The mountains block out all sunlight, still dim and shadowy, creating what seems like a separate world
Without the two springs, hot and cold, this would be but a lonely, desolate water village
　　　　　　　　Konoe Kazan

For healing ailments, I love this quiet place. Spring passes, summer comes, yet I have not returned
Before and after bathing, there is nothing to do but face the green mountains all day with spiritual intent
　　　　　　　　Tokiwa-i Toin

Peaks upon peaks rise like heavenly gates. A solitary traveler quietly faces the mountains from a small lodge
The autumn atmosphere in the valley penetrates to the bone, while green pines mingle with light crimson patches
　　　　　　　　Inoue Seigai

Returning to this famous mountain is like coming home. I rejoice at the added architectural beauty of the buildings
One thing remains the same - the bathing tradition, as people compete to come and leave their mark
　　　　　　　　Shigeno Seisai

The mountain waters flow as gently as ever. I rejoice in hoping for a poetic alliance of fallen leaves
Three previous visits exhaled the long summer. Unlike maple trees waiting for this journey
　　　　　　　　Kiyooka Tobo

Ten thousand bamboo stalks are the dwelling of gentlemen, a thousand wild plum blossoms are the home of beauties
What does the master do all day? Morning in the mountains, evening by the water's edge
　　　　　　　　Torio Tokuan

Even the valley water flows peacefully
Mount Arima, what an interesting mountain
this is　　　　　　Yamakake Murin

Autumn surpasses spring's scenery. Maple leaves on peaks illuminated by the evening sun
　　　　　　　　Goto

Mountain air is beautiful morning and evening. Birds return to each other　Goto Makinaga
Pure and clear like the Shouyang season, elegant like river and lake souls　Harino Aishu

Rising above the tops of the standing pines,
The moonlight fills Mount Shiobara　Doi Mucho

On Mount Arima it rains heavily all day. Why make the great effort to climb the mountain in such desolation?
There are medicinal springs in the earth　　Katei

Layered peaks on four sides, one valley green. Bamboo depends on spring sounds, the mountain temple is quiet
Evening bathing just finished, leaning on the railing. Gray peaks and green dripping in the space between
　　　　　　　　　　　　Renmu

【Below the road map】
I once served as an official in Settsu Province and constantly suffered from summer heat. During the three hottest periods, I would customarily retreat to Mount Arima. Mount Arima has a precious pond where sacred springs emerge through divine power. They can eliminate heat poison and cure chronic ailments. Moreover, the valley and mountain scenery is absolutely beautiful, with ancient temples among green trees representing pavilions and strange rocks in front. If such realms exist in the human world, there is no need to envy immortals. Old traces return to dreams, and seven years pass in an instant.

○ Falling again into mundane affairs, daily entangled in worldly troubles. There is an old friend in the mountains who recently played the koto, encouraging another visit. His noble spirit does not abandon me. I compose this poem to thank my old friend. Three sighs alone, another visit cannot be promised. I look up toward the western sky.

○ Kajiki, the village head of Arima, sent word urging my return visit, but I have not yet managed to go. I compose this in gratitude.

Kaei 7, Year of the Tiger, 6th month, 14th day
Regarding the Great Earthquake
This time, though there was great disaster in neighboring provinces, the people of Osaka were safe, and in their joy at this fortune
Celebrating peace throughout the realm, abundant harvests, and prosperity of family trades, day and night in unusual attire
Visiting various shrines without end
Here occurred a wondrous event: in the vicinity of Mikage in Nishinarigori, Settsu Province, a mountain collapsed
Sacred water gushed forth from between the rocks
Farmers, having learned from last year's drought
Greatly moistened their rice fields and farmland with this water
All held it in precious regard
And sang "banzai" (ten thousand years)
As an auspicious sign of future abundant harvests

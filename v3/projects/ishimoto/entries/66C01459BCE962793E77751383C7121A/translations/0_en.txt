♪The tsunami disaster in the northern regions was truly unbearable to witness
The sight of parents and children separated - this too must be karmic fate
♪The ancestral homes and storehouses inherited from our parents were destroyed by the earthquake
How utterly lost we are - this too is a natural disaster from heaven
♪After the earthquake came the great tsunami, and while we were still in shock, fires broke out
All will to live was completely lost - truly a great calamity
♪Ancestral treasures and farmlands passed down through generations were swept away
With nowhere to go, please send help quickly
♪The three prefectures that suffered this disaster will be remembered for generations to come
It is heartbreaking to hear of Aomori, Iwate, and Miyagi prefectures
♪The great tsunami surging all at once - there was no escaping or resisting it
Hearts pounding in our chests, our breasts thundering with fear
♪Both hearing and telling of it brings tears to all - the deaths from this tsunami
Combined with the injured, over 60,000 people - truly a tragic affair
♪The fishermen who escaped certain death and survived had strong fortune
Good fortune within misfortune - this too is heaven's blessing

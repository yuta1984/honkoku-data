The Difficult Bird (Nangi-chō)

On the night following the great earthquake, from around 2 AM, a mysterious bird appeared over the pleasure quarters and around the theater district. Its cry was extremely mournful. At one time, when people of various occupations had prepared delicious food and were holding a drinking party, the bird snatched away a dish of large catfish from their gathering and soared high up into the empty sky. This was truly a wondrous event. This must surely have some deep meaning, but since no one knew its true significance, people were deeply puzzled and suspicious. They said that eventually something would surely come to mind that would make sense of it all.

It is also said that Bing means "bright"—the fire of the sun's wheel, flames, and heat. This is called sovereign fire. Ding is the younger brother of fire, and also governs the south. It is also said that Ding means "lamp"—the fire of daily use in people's homes. This is called ministerial fire. Wu is the elder brother of earth, positioned in the center, governing the earth periods of the four seasons and corresponding to trustworthiness among the Five Constants. It is also said that Wu means "mother"—the mother that gives birth to the five grains and all plants. Ji is the younger brother of earth. It is also said that Ji means "to raise"—raising all implements and assisting people's activities. Geng is the elder brother of metal, governing autumn in the west, corresponding to propriety among the Five Constants, and is the direction that gathers all things. Therefore it is said that Geng means "to change"—renewal and transformation. All things are born in the world of wood and change and are gathered in the world of metal. Xin is the younger brother of metal, also corresponding to autumn. It is also said that Xin means "new"—all things are renewed. Ren is the elder brother of water, governing winter in the north and corresponding to wisdom among the Five Constants. It is also said that Ren means "pregnant"—all things are gathered in the world of metal and born in the world of wood. Gui is the younger brother of water. It is also said that Gui means "to measure"—water is the beginning of measuring all things, wisdom is the foundation of measuring all plans.

Zi (9 o'clock) beginning, Chou (8 o'clock) binding, Yin (7 o'clock) opening, Mao (6 o'clock) flourishing, Chen (5 o'clock) shaking, Si (4 o'clock) stopping, Wu (9 o'clock) standing out, Wei (8 o'clock) tasting, Shen (7 o'clock) body, You (6 o'clock) knowing, Xu (5 o'clock) breaking/returning, Hai (4 o'clock) ending/exhausting.

Zi means "root"—the 9th night hour called midnight. This is the end of yin and beginning of yang. Therefore, the character zi combines the characters for "ending" and "beginning." It is the root that gives birth to all things. Chou is extreme yin and loses yang energy—the 8th night hour called cock-crow, the end of things. Yin is when yin energy is captured by yang energy—the 7th morning hour called level dawn, when there is energy rising levelly. Mao gives birth to the sun—the 6th morning hour called daybreak, when people open their doors. Therefore, the character mao has the shape of opening door panels left and right. Chen is when the sun rises and stands—the 5th morning hour called meal time, the extreme number of yang. Si is when the sun's energy is full—the 4th daytime hour called mid-morning, when the sun climbs to the middle. Yang energy fills and rises. Wu is when yang energy is born—the 9th daytime hour called midday; when the sun climbs to the middle of heaven, it can only decline. Wei means the sun penetrating—that is, the crossroads of the sun—the 8th daytime hour called afternoon decline. Shen means the sun departing—the 7th evening hour called late afternoon. The restless nature of monkeys corresponds to the busyness before evening. You means the sun is gathered—the 6th evening hour called sunset. The character for door bar is the reverse of mao, showing doors closed together with a crossbar inserted. Xu means yang energy departs—the 5th evening hour called dusk. Also, xu means "to break"—yin energy breaks yang. Plants and trees are broken by frost and perish. Hai means yang energy returns—the 4th night hour called people settle. When slight yang mingles with abundant yin, people settle and conceive. Plants and trees return and conceive buds. At xu there is breaking; at hai earthquakes end. Starting from zi, pointing to earthquakes after the spring that spreads to the end, this is called "ten thousand years of joy."

The great earthquake of the 2nd day of the 10th month was on a chen day, past the 5th night hour and before the 4th, in the lower part of the xu hour. Xu and hai correspond to the northwest; xu governs earth and hai governs water. Chen corresponds to the southeast and governs earth. At this season there is much moisture in the soil, and though the energy would transform all things, the yang energy above is still young and the time has not yet come for it to manifest. This energy transforms and becomes an earthquake. Shaking at chen is sudden. Xu means breaking and hai means ending—these are sayings about the end of the year and the finish of the day. Though it bursts forth and shakes and collapses momentarily, the next day is a si day, and since si means stopping, the source of earthquakes is lost. When it passes, it moves to the zi hour, and since zi is the 9th hour and the end of yin and beginning of yang,

This is heaven and earth stretching forth, the root that gives birth to all things and the five grains. Therefore, when we examine this, it is not a sign of bad years but shows that it is an auspicious omen of an age that has truly begun with abundant harvests. I hope to resolve people's confusion and that there will be no one who harbors taboos and doubts.

Though it is true that this energy exists until the earth's form is settled, there should be no more worry about great earthquakes. However, heaven's nature is unfathomable. Vigilance remains essential.

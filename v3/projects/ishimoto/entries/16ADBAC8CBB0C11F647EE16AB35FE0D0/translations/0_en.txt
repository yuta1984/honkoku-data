**Title: A Discourse on the Good and Bad Omens of Earthquakes**

**From the upper right:**
Earthquakes are the foundation of abundant harvests. There is nothing to worry about. In autumn, plants and trees return to the soil, and through winter's energy, they contain buds in the earth, harboring heaven's blessings in the ground to give birth to all things. When the anger of seasonal order has already manifested, it becomes an earthquake. Since earthquakes are the earth's affliction, people of the fields do not rest. Humans regard heaven and earth as father and mother, being the leaders of all things. All within the four seas are brothers. Therefore, it is natural human conduct for the elderly to guide the young, and the young to assist the elderly. However, recently, in frivolous places, human sentiment has become thin, the separation between self and others has grown strong, people prefer fine food, enjoy unseasonable flowers, and spend large amounts of money in ways that do not accord with heavenly principle. Even if one escapes the disasters of earthquakes, going against teachings leaves one's person incomplete—one should fear and be cautious.

Now, heaven is yang, positioned above and covering—this is the virtue of a father. Earth is yin, positioned below and supporting—this is the way of a mother. When yin and yang interact, they give birth to the Five Elements. Their energy returns to heaven and the four seasons proceed; their form spreads across the earth, giving birth to humans, birds, beasts, fish, insects, and plants. Therefore, heaven and earth are called the great father and mother.

Humans receive the excellent energy of the Five Elements at birth, which is why they are called the spirits of all things. Therefore, following heaven and earth as father and mother is called filial piety, and following the sun, moon, and sovereign is called loyalty. Truly, because humans conceal their nature in heaven and earth, there is nothing that exists between heaven and earth that is not also present in humans. Because heaven is round, human heads are round. Heaven has the sun and moon, and humans have two eyes. Heaven has arrays of stars, and humans have teeth. Heaven has wind and rain, and humans have joy and anger. Heaven has thunder, and humans have voice. Heaven has yin and yang, and humans have male and female. Heaven has four seasons, and humans have four limbs. Heaven has heat and cold, and humans have fever and chills. Heaven has day and night, and humans have waking and sleeping. Heaven has five tones, and humans have five organs. Heaven has six pitch-pipes, and humans have six viscera. Heaven has ten heavenly stems, and humans have ten fingers. Heaven has twelve earthly branches, and humans have ten toes and male genitalia. Women lack these two, therefore they form embryos. Since a year has twelve months, humans have twelve joints. Since a year has 360 days, humans have 360 bone joints. The earth's terrain corresponds to human foot shape. Earth has twelve water channels, and humans have twelve meridians. Earth has high mountains, and humans have shoulders and knees. Earth has spring veins, and humans have qi and blood. Earth has plants and trees, and humans have fine hair and muscles. Earth has sand and stones, and humans have bones and flesh.

Everything else that exists between heaven and earth is present in humans without exception. Even Mount Sumeru described in Buddhist scriptures is completely present within one body. The Trayastrimsa Heaven said to be at Sumeru's peak is the heavenly bone at the top of a person's head. Sumeru's circular trees are the hair growing on the round head. Indra is the forehead, and the Sudarsana citadel is the eyebrows—meaning the opening of joyful brows. The Hall of Good Dharma is the Buddha-nature that all people possess.

The Four Heavenly Kings—Dhrtarastra, Virudhaka, Virupaksa, and Vaisravana—are said to dwell in Sumeru's four directions. Virupaksa (Wide-Eyes) represents both eyes. Vaisravana (Much-Hearing) represents the ears. Virudhaka (Growth) represents the nose. The mouth, which maintains the body's kingdom through all foods, is Dhrtarastra (State-Maintaining). Sumeru's nine mountains are the nine parts: shoulders, elbows, chest, abdomen, genitals, knees, back, waist, and buttocks. The eight seas are the still waters of the eight consciousnesses in the chest. The four continents are the four limbs.

In the song of Sumeru, "the north is yellow" refers to understanding the color of the yellow-black night. "The east is white" refers to the whitening color of dawn in the east. "The south is blue" refers to the blue sky of bright daylight. "The west is crimson" refers to the redness of the evening sun's shadow. This too represents one day and night of this world. The mountain of Susheng Road sees the sun emerge from the eastern mountains and set in the western mountains, then revive again in the east at dawn. Humans too are born in the eastern yang, die in the western yin, and revolve eastward to be reborn. Considering this, ah, how precious! Humans must cultivate the way of heaven and follow the principles of earth.

Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, Ren, Gui—these are heaven. Jia (Wood-Elder) is the elder brother of wood, positioned in the eastern spring and corresponding to benevolence among the Five Constants. Being the leader of the Ten Stems, it is also read as "beginning." This is the beginning of spring and the beginning of wood and the world. Yi (Wood-Younger) is the younger brother of wood, positioned in the eastern spring. This is earth. Bing (Fire-Elder) is the elder brother of fire, governing the southern summer and corresponding to righteousness among the Five Constants.

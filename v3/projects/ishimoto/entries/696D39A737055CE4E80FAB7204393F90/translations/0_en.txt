Regarding the State of Earthquake Shaking in Various Places

First, this person called "Shaking Hardship" was born in Yurisomemura, Namazunosho, Shinano Province, and being a reliable shaking person, along with demons, became a lost person and shook out in various directions toward places of strange phenomena. This resulted in destruction. Regarding fires, it was determined that they would occur from the night of the 2nd day of the 10th month of this year of the Rabbit until the early afternoon of the following 3rd day. Among the prosperity of destitute people, collapsed houses were dug up, and one-third of the dead were certainly thrown in. Regarding the installations, the catfish is a terrible thing, and sparks will suddenly rain down everywhere.

First, regarding the activation of Lord Storehouse, there is no need to burn, and the improper conduct of the household shall not be shaken.

First, if this person deceives the eyes during the earthquake and considers the sleep of the women in the kitchen, seeing the crucial vulnerable spots, ignites sparks, props up makeshift wooden supports, causes internal earthquakes, damages precious containers and flees from the shaking, and if walls fall, skilled plasterers should immediately repair them.

First, family members are in pain, completely bewildered, temples shake out in the middle of the night, hillside temples, completely naked commotion in the city center, confusion in great fires, with no proper seating. There is no support for the shaking activation in the Tan sect. If roof tiles fall due to creaking and resonating sounds, and if prolonged shaking occurs, we will quickly shake out to the palace without causing any wooden hardship, and after five or seven days of rain, things will be as usual.

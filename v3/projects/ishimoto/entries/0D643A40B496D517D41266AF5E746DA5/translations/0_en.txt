"Dialogue Between the Great Earthquake Catfish of the Night of October 2nd, Ansei 2"

【Catfish】
Hey, you worthless Americans! You make fools of Japan and come pushing your way in more forcefully after two or three years. Because you people come, Edo town is all in an uproar. Stop this useless trade exchange! Edo already has enough candy sellers walking around. We have no need for you, so quickly hoist your sails and fix your rudder and get out of here, get out!

【America】
How impertinent, catfish monk! That's not for you to know. Our country is a merciful nation where anyone - merchants or hunters - who shows mercy, even if they work in fields and mountains today, may be discovered tomorrow and become king. That's why people come from various countries to admire us, making us the United States. But the trouble is, even as our population grows, we don't have enough food, so we come to Japan asking for rice, radishes, and chickens, but you won't give them to us. That's why we keep coming back bothering you.

【Catfish】
Shut up, Perry! No matter how much you claim with your mouth that yours is a merciful country, if you don't have food to eat, it must be a poor country. If America had gods and Buddha, you should be able to produce plenty of grains. Since you boast like that, you must have been taking daily food by piracy. Thinking of this, our country's gods gathered together and stirred up Chinese winds, sinking your ships and Russia into the sea - that was certainly last November. The gods will not tolerate disrespect. Don't talk nonsense. I won't listen, I won't listen.

【America】
How absurd to make up such reasoning, catfish! You, who are usually held down by humans with gourds, tried to drive us back by shaking Shimoda and Numazu on the fourth day of the eleventh month last year. But America doesn't waver. We don't deceive.

【Catfish】
Agh, noisy foreign devils! If you won't leave, I'll bury you in the mud!

【America】
If you'll bury us, try it! I'm also a punching gun!

【Plasterer】
Ah, both of you calm down, calm down! Those far away, listen to the sound of the echo! Those nearby, come and see with your eyes - the broken storehouse, from corner to back corner, I'm asked to replaster, asked and asked. Even the fallen walls I replaster with my skilled trowel - I'm an Edo native who receives praise from everyone, all from this earthquake commotion. Thinking of this, I'm grateful. Now, now, now, you two should stop quarreling and compete in a tug-of-war. Ah, I don't want to see it. Please stop.

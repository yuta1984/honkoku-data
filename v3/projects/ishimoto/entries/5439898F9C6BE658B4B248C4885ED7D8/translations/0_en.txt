Mochimaru's Treasure Ship Departure

Mochimaru: "Ah, how painful, how painful! To spit out all at once what I had so carefully gathered and collected - what foolishness this is! What's the point of this? If this was going to happen, I should have spent it all by now.
　　Gei, gei, gei, gei" (groaning sounds)

Catfish: "Listen, master, because you usually squeeze the common folk too hard and make them suffer hardships, you are now experiencing such painful, painful thoughts. From now on, you should reform your heart and practice compassion and good deeds."

Collector: "Now, now, you people shouldn't be so greedy. There's still plenty more to collect slowly. You should be satisfied and head to the temporary shelters. Oh yes, that's right - if you hoard too much and get caught in another earthquake, that would be terrible, so it's better to go to the temporary shelters and spend it all. It will help with circulation to various places."

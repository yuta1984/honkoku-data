Now, Shinano Province consists of ten counties with a total assessed value of 547,300 koku, making it the highest-valued province in Japan. It is particularly rich in mountains and rivers with water flowing in all directions, making it a top-ranking province. The people are honest and there are many famous products; it is a land of abundant five grains. However, for some unknown reason, from the night of March 24th, Kōka 4 (1847), Year of the Boar, an unprecedented great earthquake occurred, transforming mountains and rivers, destroying temples, shrines, and houses, causing many deaths of people and horses, and bringing suffering from fires and floods. I record in detail the calamities that befell the villages, and also to make known to future generations the imperial benevolence of our lord's compassionate relief efforts for the people.

The weather in March had been excessively warm for several days. From the fourth hour of the night on the 24th, mountain rumbling and earthquakes began. The area around Zenkō-ji Temple was particularly severe. Before people could even recognize it as an earthquake, great mountains collapsed, water overflowed, the ground roared, splitting five sun to one shaku, or five shaku to one jō wide, spewing black and red mud, with flame-like objects burning upward. The palace, treasure house, and people of the eighteen temple districts were crushed and buried in the earth. The crying voices of men and women, old and young, echoed to heaven. Particularly as it was nighttime, people fled in confusion, struck by great stones, falling into valley streams, in tremendous panic. Meanwhile, flames arose in all directions causing destruction.

The villages in this area include: to the north - Ōmine Togakushi-yama, Uematsu, Kitamatsu, Shinkō-ji, Nishijō, Yoshimura, Tagodaira, Temuro, Ii, Kodaira, Ochikake, Kojima, Ōshima, Shinmachi, Kashiwabara, Nojiri, Akagawa, and the Sekigawa checkpoint; to the east - Kondō, Ma-no-gosho, Naka-no-gosho, Araki, Aokishima, Ōtsuka, Mashima, Koshimata, Mizusawa, Nishi-terao, Tanaka; to the south - Kitahara, Fujieda, Amenomiya, Yashiro, Mukōhachiman, Shikawa, Yamada, Komatsuhara, Kokue, Kurayama, Chausuyama, Tanbashima; to the west - Shimbō, Kamiya, Iriyama, Tanaka, Hashikibe - all under the jurisdiction of the magistrate. Destroyed houses: 5,390; half-destroyed: over 2,200. However, the timber, though smashed, is still usable. Similar to destroyed houses, the dead number approximately 2,700, injured about 900, horses 173, cattle 2, buried in the earth. About 20 houses, 46 shrine-temples, 22 village storehouses. This is within about 60,000 koku worth of territory.

Most pitiful of all, during this Zenkō-ji Temple exhibition, pilgrims from various provinces staying there, unfamiliar with the area and at a complete loss, over 200 were crushed to death instantly. Those desperately trying to pray to Buddha - both locals and travelers who rushed into the main hall and prayed with all their hearts - numbered over 780. In such a great disaster, particularly severe in this area, only the main hall, mountain gate, and sutra repository remained undamaged amid the calamity. This truly demonstrates the blessed benefits of the revered Jambudvīpa gold statue that has been transmitted through three countries to this degenerate age. It should be feared and revered. The main hall is 18 ken wide and 36 ken deep, with front gates on all four sides - east, west, south, and north. There are four temple names: east is Jōgakuzan Zenkō-ji, west is Fushazan Jōdo-ji, south is Nanmyōzan Muryōju-ji, north is Hokukūzan Unjō-ji. It belongs to the Tendai sect with temple lands of 1,000 koku. As a hermitage temple, its origins are well-known.

Regarding Minochi County: Obuse, Jindai, Asano, Ōkuchi, Nigasawa, Imai, Akasawa, Mitsumata, Sakaimura, Mozaemon-mura, Komadate, Togakushi, Koizumi, Tokari, Ōtsubo, Sone, Hōjō, Kosakai, Waraifukasawa. First of all, Iiyama castle town experienced extremely severe earthquakes. When trying to flee, people fell and could not stand, having no choice but to fall backward. Old people and children cried and screamed, the earth split spewing earth and sand, mountains collapsed, and deaths of men and women reached 430 in the immediate area, with many more in the surrounding countryside. Among these, the entire riverside village of Tanbagawa was swept away, their whereabouts unknown.

In Sarashina County: Uchikoji, Shimahashi, Motōhara, Wada, Furuichiba, Karuizawa, Yoshiwara, Takefusa, Imaizumi, Mizu, Anzoko, Komatsuhara, Kubo, and the rear districts of Teranaka - all had their houses toppled. Particularly at Inariyama, the 28 houses that collapsed were swept away by great floods on the 28th, their whereabouts unknown. Here stands Mount Iwakura, a high mountain of 18-19 jō in height, located between Antei village and Yamahirabayashi village. This mountain roared, the surroundings thundered like great thunder, half its face collapsed on both ends - one section 30 chō, another 80 chō - pressing into the upper reaches of the Tanbagawa, burying nearby villages entirely. Floodwaters overflowed 7-8 jō high, making several villages like lakes, with countless deaths of people and horses. A little north of there was a rock mountain about 6 jō high, which also collapsed and pushed about 5 chō into the river, pressing both Tsuchiya and Fujikura villages into the water.

In Azumi County, a place called Shinmachi with 380 houses was completely destroyed, then immediately caught fire and burned down. From there, floodwaters about 2 jō deep surged, too terrible to look at. Miyabuchi, Inukai, Koume, Nakasone, Fumiiri-ji, Takekuma, Kuranari, Kanmachi, Hosogaeshi, Uramachi, Todorokimura, Horigane-mura, Odai, Nakabori, Jōge-toba, Sumiyoshi, Nagao, Kashiwabara, Nanokaichi, Mamabe, Kitsuneshima, Ikeda-machi, Hori-no-uchi, Sonehara, Miyamoto, Kusao, Funaba-mura and others suffered major damage.

In Chiisagata County: Akiwa, Ikitsuka, Ueda castle town, Nishihara, Shinchō, Kami-kojima, Shimo-kojima. In this area mountains roared and earthquakes struck, the ground rumbled, and the local people felt as if they were barely alive, thinking the earth might split at any moment. Though the earth did not actually split, houses collapsed and there were many injured. Maeda, Tezuka, Yamada, Bessho, Yonezawa, Kutsukake, Naramoto, Ichinosawa - about 140 villages.

In Chikuma County, the Hachiman-mura area was extremely severe with repeated aftershocks, causing many casualties among people and horses. Hōfuku-ji, Nanaarashi, Akanuta, Horamura, Okada-chō, Matsuoka, Ariake, Mizukumi, Matsumoto castle town area - 120-130 villages shook severely. Shōnai, Tanuki, Chikuma, Shinmachi, Arai, Nagata, Shimo-shin, Kami-shin, Mitsumizo, extending to the borders of Hida and Etchū.

In Saku County: Komoro castle town, to the west Takihara, Ichimachi, Honmachi, Yora-mura, Yotsuya, Mase, Oiwake, Karishuku, Migishuku, Kutsukake, Karuizawa, Akasawa, Tōgemachi, Yasaki, Yamada Asama-yama to the Jōshū entrance - repeatedly shaking strongly. The riverside areas were extremely severe. From there, in Suwa County, Takashima castle town, Ōmizu, Takagi were slight, while Yaehara, Ōhinata, Hosoya, Hirabayashi, Nunobiki shook somewhat strongly.

In Hanishina County, the Matsushiro castle town area began shaking from the 24th, with three strong quakes until the morning of the 29th and evening of the last day of the month, pushing out great stones, collapsing mountains, with shrine areas particularly severe. Many houses collapsed, and in the downstream riverside areas, mountain rock faces collapsed damaging houses. Hirabayashi, Kakemura, Akashiba, Sekiya, Nishijō, Sekiya, Kawakami-shimo, Tokukura, Nakajō, Yokoo, Imai, Negawa-no-shuku, Jōge-shiojiri-mura and others similarly affected.

In the Takai County section, east of the Tanbagawa: Suzaka castle town, Nakashima, Gojinya, riverside villages, Fukushima, Takanashi, Nakashima, Beppu, Iida, Haba, Kuribayashi, Ōmata area to Tagami, Iwai, Yasuda, Sakai and others shook strongly, toppling many houses. From there to the Echigo region, shaking began from the 24th, gradually intensifying. The hour of the ox on the 29th brought a tremendous earthquake to Matsuzaki, Arai area to Kubiki County's Takada castle town, Imamachi, Nakayashiki, Kasuga area, collapsing houses with particularly many casualties among people and horses. The Shinshū side was especially severe, with mountains collapsing all together, water overflowing, rolling great boulders. Most pitifully, a small village called Nagasawa was crushed by a great mountain, with about 70 people buried underground, only hands and feet visible. To call it pitiful is quite inadequate. Moreover, on the 29th, the Imamachi area was pulled into great waves, with many houses swept away.

This great earthquake in Shinano and Echigo provinces was truly an extraordinary rare event. Though earthquakes have occurred several times since ancient times, none have involved such earth-splitting, mud and sand eruption, mountain collapses, and human casualties - this was an unprecedented calamity. The Zenkō-ji area was severe from the 24th to 25th, while Matsushiro and the Echigo region continued until the 29th and 30th, collapsing mountains and rivers across 20 ri east-west and 30 ri north-south. Though the earthquakes gradually subsided, collapsed mountains and overflowing floods blocked highways for people and horses. Where the ground cracked about 10 ken wide in streaks, black and red muddy water gushed out, mountains collapsed with great stones rolling down, all fields completely changed, irrigation channels broke and collapsed, valley streams shook and were buried. Muddy water gushed out everywhere, stored grain bags all collapsed, covered with mud and water, buried underground.

Particularly at Kawanakajima, the great floods could not be contained by human effort. If water was drained on one side, the other side suffered water damage of unknown extent. If flood control was attempted on the west side, the remaining villages on the east side would be swept away - both sides faced great danger, truly a situation approaching major disturbance. However, until official inspection and orders were given, both sides were forbidden to take action. Though canal-digging laborers were immediately dispatched, floodwaters continued to overflow and surge. People in this area were separated from parents, parted from children, husbands and wives not knowing each other's whereabouts. Village headmen and officials seemed to have lost their senses, with no idea how to clean up the aftermath. Before collapsed houses, entire families had no shelter from rain and dew, completely at a loss, constantly weeping, living miserably. Rice was covered with soil and muddy water, with no means of obtaining food. Poor and suffering people just lay down crying, clinging to corpses. The injured were numerous, unable to bear the pain. All villages were similarly affected, with no strength to help each other. Immediate food needs could not be met, and drinking water had to come from irrigation channels, all muddy water for daily life. To call it pitiful is inadequate - in both Minochi and Takai counties, 70-80% of fields were destroyed, houses collapsed, tools lost, about 80% damaged. It was impossible to predict what further floods might come, so riverside villages evacuated to mountain forests. But the mountains too rumbled daily, water forces like thunder - if they burst suddenly, more flood disasters of unpredictable nature could occur. Various emergency measures were taken, but on the evening of April 13th at the seventh hour, suddenly mountains and valleys roared and rumbled, water burst through cutting left and right embankments, overflowing the tops of dikes. Not only Kawanakajima but reverse currents pushed into the Saigawa, impossible to prevent. Water filled up to the Matsushiro magistrate's area below, sweeping away villages along the river, about 2 jō high. Not only crops but many drowned and injured, an extremely rare occurrence in villages throughout history. About 300 villages were swept away. After the great disaster from the 24th, these additional water disasters were beyond description. However much one may speak of natural calamity, such disasters made it nearly impossible for good people to survive.

Therefore, the magistrates and domain lords, like compassionate mothers pitying their children, erected relief shelters, providing not only rice and money but generous aid with deep compassion for relief. The benevolent grace of peaceful times is so grateful it inspires awe. So that people should not forget this imperial benevolence, I record it on this single sheet of paper.

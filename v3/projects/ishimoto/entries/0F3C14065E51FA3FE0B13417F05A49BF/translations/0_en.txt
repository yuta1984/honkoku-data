Record of the Burning Collapse of Mount Unzen in Shimabara on the First Day of the Fourth Month, Kansei 4 (Mizunoe-Ne Year)

On the 13th, I arrived in Kumamoto and went to the guest house, but as it was inconvenient, I went to Kasaya Tōzaemon's place. I promptly submitted a document box through Tōzaemon's mediation, but as the reply would take time, Tōzaemon suggested I stay, so on the following 14th, I went to both Takahashi and Omura to hear the accounts.

From the first day of the fourth month, there were severe earthquakes. The front mountain of Shimabara collapsed into the sea, and there were damages and deaths in various villages due to the tsunami, as detailed in the separate document. The survivors were provided care at Shimogawara after investigation. The number was about 400 people, who received care from the 2nd to around the 10th.

As the Lord of Shimabara was staying at a place called Moriyama, I went there on the 18th and submitted a document box through the mediation of Takezoe Jizaemon, the headman of Mimuro Village. What this Jizaemon told me was as follows:

At a place called Oshigatani in Mount Fugen within Shimabara domain, deer, monkeys, and other birds died last December, which was the beginning of ominous events. Various strange things occurred.

1. On the 18th of this New Year, the stone platform of Mount Fugen collapsed and erupted. It expelled stones from the burning crater, burning down 2-3 ri per day, with intense earthquakes and rumbling day and night without end. Due to this, not only all of Shimabara but neighboring provinces suffered damage to storehouses, fences, stone walls, and loose plaster walls.

2. From around late February, pear trees and peony flowers bloomed throughout Shimabara castle town, pears grew on bamboo groves, and broad beans grew on Chinese plum trees—everyone called it miraculous.

3. From around six o'clock in the morning on the first day of the fourth month, the mountains and sea shook violently, and while people were alarmed, at around four o'clock that night there was particularly strong shaking. About 1.5 ri of the front mountain of Mount Fugen collapsed completely, and the entire castle town, as well as Antokuji Village and Ima Village, were crushed beneath, with no survivors.

4. This collapse jutted into Shimabara's sea, creating numerous islands.

5. At the time of this collapse, large fireballs—one from Hizen Province and one from Kumamoto—flew and met in the sea, shattered, scattered in all directions, making the sea like boiling water, and many fish died and floated up.

6. On the early morning of the 2nd of the fourth month, His Lordship went to the residence of Nakano Sazaemon, the headman of Moriyama Village, about 6 ri within his domain, and remains there still.

7. The young lords had previously evacuated to Moriyama Village.

8. The castle town did not collapse, though more than half was damaged by earthquakes.

9. The samurai residences suffered likewise, and all the retainers moved to the three villages of Moriyama, Mimuro, and Yamada.

10. The district called Teppō-machi, where various servants lived, remained. Of the castle town, about twenty houses remained.

11. Regarding damaged villages in the vicinity, as recorded in the separate document, the exact number of deaths is unclear, but approximately over 20,000 people are said to have died.

This is what I heard from headman Takezoe Jizaemon.

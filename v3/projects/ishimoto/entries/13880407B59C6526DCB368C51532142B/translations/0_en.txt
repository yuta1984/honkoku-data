Kawari-ken (Changing Hand Game)

〽Well then, Kannon of Shinshū earthquake exhibition
People swaying, bodies swaying, swaying inside all wobbly
Let's go swaying, jan jan
The wicked Zenkō-ji old woman got
crushed by the earthquake, ha ha, how funny! Even building embankments is useless
Let's change and go

Here, on the night of March 24th, Kōka 4 (1847), at the fourth hour,
this great earthquake in Shinshū province caused Zenkō-ji temple and the surrounding areas,
from Kawanakajima to Tanbashima ferry, as well as Koichi's
mountains across the river to crumble into the river with the shaking, damming up
the river water, which overflowed into people's houses, causing no small damage to rice fields and farmland. However, only the main hall of Zenkō-ji temple
was not destroyed. Now, toward Echigo province, around Kashiwahara Sekigawa and Echigo Takada,
and toward the Jōshū entrance, Oiwake, Kutsukake, Karuizawa, Komoro, and the Iiyama area were particularly
severe. To the south, from around Aida to Matsushiro and the Ueda vicinity, the Chikuma
River was blocked up, and floods suddenly rushed out. The cries and screams of people and horses were
almost unbearable to witness. Then, the next morning at the sixth hour, things finally settled down, and people felt relieved.

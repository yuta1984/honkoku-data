Now, on the dawn of October 28, Meiji 24 (1891), at 6:20 AM, the earthquake was particularly severe in the Gifu, Nagoya, and Ogaki regions, with violent tremors that split the ground and toppled houses. The number of deaths reached tens of thousands, making it impossible to count them all. Moreover, fires broke out and some areas suffered flood damage, making this truly an unprecedented disaster.

First, houses collapsed and people were trapped with half their bodies pinned under the debris, unable to escape. Fires then spread from nearby, and they were burned to death while still alive. Others died with half their bodies buried in the ground when it split open. It was so pitiful that words cannot adequately describe it. Running trains could not operate normally, and while passengers were wondering what was happening, the question arose whether to stop the trains or not.

During earthquakes and fires,
who could avoid
getting injured?
Countless people
in Nakanochō, first of all
Yoshiwara
collapsed together with
the Ichikawa (theater), like the aragoto (kabuki style) of destroyed houses,
immediately caught fire
the great sword struck fiercely
earthquake makeup lines, at Nihonzutsumi
everyone rushing, falling and getting up
the eboshi-wearing crowd noisily clamoring in Saruwaka-chō
The theater burning was also a double disaster from last year and this year, Tsurubishi (family crest)
turned to ash again, the persimmon-colored court dress, how quickly everything changed
Truly, this great
disaster was no lie - Honjō, Fukagawa, and according to reports, Tsukiji, Shiba,
Yamanote, Marunouchi to Ogawa-chō, the red faces of the vast burned areas
Not under the sword but under the beams, unable to be laid again, for this reason I have come forth

At Kashima Great Shrine
in the inner sanctuary, Solid Rock
Tarō Ishizue, today
as a beginning
pressed down the catfish
with the keystone,
now that it's secured
not even the nine rings
of a five-story pagoda,
let alone one rin
will move. Who
do you think I am?
Ah, even my wife
secretly
evacuated, geishas'
warmed sake
burned and collapsed
in the midst of all this
the prosperity of the pleasure quarters
is the blessing of an unshakeable reign. Grateful drums and bells
whose sounds never cease, the great segaki ceremony of the second day
lined up, monks...

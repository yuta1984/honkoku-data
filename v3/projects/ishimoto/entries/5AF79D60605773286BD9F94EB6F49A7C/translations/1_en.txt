【Description of the Morokawa Area】
Within Yūki, there is a Zen temple called An'on-ji. As treasures of this temple, there are a Buddhist robe (kesa) and crystal prayer beads that have been passed down from ancient times. These are items from when the monk Gen'ō prayed over the Sesshōseki (Killing Stone) at Nasuno.

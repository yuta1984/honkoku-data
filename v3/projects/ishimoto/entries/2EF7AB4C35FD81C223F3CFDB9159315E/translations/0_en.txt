Benevolent Blessings of the Peaceful Reign

Around the fourth hour of the night on October 2nd, 2nd year of Ansei, Kiboar year, there was a great earthquake and fire in Edo, causing people to be gripped by fear and unable to find peace. However, the government, with compassion, provided relief to the destitute people throughout Edo, for which we are grateful beyond words, though it is presumptuous to say so. This led to endless voices of gratitude from the people. At this time, virtuous townspeople, property owners, and landlords in the capital, admiring the benevolence of this peaceful reign, made monetary donations to the five relief shelters and to their own tenants and associates. Particularly noteworthy are those who extended their charity to neighboring districts regardless of their own location. We have compiled a record of such people on this document, and plan to investigate and add more benefactors as we discover them. Due to this unprecedented benevolence, we publish this record for the perusal of distinguished gentlemen everywhere.

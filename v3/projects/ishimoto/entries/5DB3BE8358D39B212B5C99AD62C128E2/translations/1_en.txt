Illustration of the Prosperity of Ikaho Hot Springs

【Main Text】
Among Japan's hot springs that have proven efficacy for various ailments, the Ikaho Hot Springs in Jōshū, Gunma Prefecture, were discovered during the reign of Emperor Suinin, the 11th emperor, and demonstrate the most superior and miraculous effects. Recently, when the Tokyo Pharmaceutical Bureau analyzed the composition of these hot springs, it was confirmed that they have particularly remarkable effects on digestive disorders, women's diseases, malignant rheumatic conditions, hernia, nervous disorders, apoplexy, and contusions—even in cases where various medicines had shown no effect over many years.

In fact, when withered and shriveled branches of plants and trees are immersed in these hot springs, they immediately revive, and when goldfish, carp, and crucian carp are kept in the hot water, their bodies grow fat and develop oils—effects that no other hot springs can match.

In July of Meiji 12 (1879), Her Majesty the Empress Dowager made an imperial visit to Ikaho, and even after her return to the capital, she had this hot spring water brought to the imperial palace and regularly bathed in it.

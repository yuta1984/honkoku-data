Great Earthquake and Great Tsunami - Excerpts from Adachigahara Act III

【First Section】
When did this old body become like this?
Suddenly startled, rolling over and breaking through the fence
The aftermath investigation is up to me to handle properly
(unclear passage) suddenly realizing
Though divine sight cannot be obtained
Though trying to run
The shamisen with torn skin
Like beach lilies taking flight
So full of gaps as to be useless
Lamenting is reasonable, in all matters
Though we've come this far

【Second Section】
Old houses supported by logs
People burying pottery by digging holes
People escaping from alleys to vacant lots
Store clerks remaining inside
Large ships pushed into the river
People acting as if they know when they'll return
People who encountered the earthquake on the road
Swaying violently amid the chaos
Toba Bay - Great tsunami
Managing affairs - increasing shipwrights
Theater teahouses
People who scattered and fled

【Third Section】
Startled with surprise, then collapsing again
What an unexpected turn of events
This is far too severe
Now I understand, how shocking
Though it's my own body, I've lost all affection for it
Hearing this, my heart is not my own
Being driven away, at that bridge over there
The northern consort of Hachiman Shrine
If you ask her, she would know
This hinders our great ambitions
Firmly lowering the lock on the latch
The place where I thought to cut the rope and escape

【Fourth Section】
People fainting upon hearing "tsunami"
The prow of a ship entered the parlor
Evening of November 5th
The long-nailed landlord
Sick people being evacuated on stretchers
People who came from Ise to work
Tea boats that encountered the tsunami
The capital that was peaceful
People who returned from Edo
Kyoto's year-end theater opening
People fleeing to the countryside with their families
Ship captains telling tsunami stories

【Title】The Damaged Statue of the Weeping Buddha - Special Exhibition for Fifty Days at Yamano-shuku Shōten-chō, in Seventh Heaven

【Content】
What we humbly contemplate is the damaged statue of the Weeping Buddha of Shimao-kon, the principal deity of Zenkōji Temple in Shinano Province, transmitted from the northern provinces. Long ago, during the reign of Emperor Keisei Tennō, the eight-hundredth generation of Indian tengu monk-priests, a person named Hikohachi from the branch shrine of Catfish Minister's Noya family became deeply devoted to this damaged statue. He made pilgrimages day and night, but finding no benefit together, he struck and beat it. When young people caused a great commotion, they finally managed to lift it up, carried it on their backs, and brought it to Kanebori Temple on Mount Okyakusan in Hanenage Village in Noji Province, where they had a brief intimate bond.

Therefore, this time we have made Yamano-shuku Shōten-chō a temporary lodging and are holding this exhibition. For the benefit of ordinary people seeking spiritual connection, we open the sacred doors and manifest enlightenment from delusion. Those who visit once will calm the great earthquakes, dispel their troubles, and in the future will surely live on a single lotus platform, ascend to the highest heaven, and undoubtedly extend their life's flower canopy in the joy of eternal bliss. Faithful devotees should come to worship with a sincere offering.

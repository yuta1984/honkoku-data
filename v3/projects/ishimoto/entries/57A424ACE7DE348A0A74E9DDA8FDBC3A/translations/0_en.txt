Kashima's Fear

Even when the great nation's earth moves and destroys homes,
The people's hearth prosperity restored
By the ruler's benevolence
Is truly an awe-inspiring
Imperial achievement.
By the god Wakeikazuchi, the keystone
That will never slip remains unmoved—
A sign of this imperial reign.

The world-reforming earthquake
Has soon left no trace,
And the proclamation of good things
Creates such a commotion.

Children of Enma
Those who were crushed
Are children of karma

Carpenter
The good wages too
Are just from yesterday and today,
Yes indeed, yes indeed
But the work
Is terribly long,
　　　　　　Yes indeed, yes indeed

Tamaya Jishinbei (Earthquake Jishinbei)
The Scene of Hiding Under a Tub

The Row of Houses in Distress

〽At bedtime in the evening, the violently shaking earthquake,
The force of the fire affects all the children,
Wandering with nowhere to go, what can be said—
Such circumstances in the greatest pleasure quarter of the northern provinces, the night crying
voices, even the moored boats, no customers
disturb their sleep. Among them, the calamity at the high-class brothels
is somehow sluggishly causing terrible suffering, like wind
enemies of this floating world, and so the rising
verse ends with aftershocks, instead of a turtle,
the sin of hand-balls through the lattice, the public
bath's 〽hiding under a tub is a miserable fate,
Jishinbei (Earthquake Jishinbei) sheds tears in distress

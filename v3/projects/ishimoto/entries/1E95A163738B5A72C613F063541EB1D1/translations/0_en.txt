Memorial Service for Earthquake Victims
Joint Opening of the Main Buddhist Images
of the Thirty-Three Sacred Sites of Western Japan
(April 1st to May 3rd) in Ogaki Town

Copy of the Announcement Notice
Deeply sympathizing with the tragic circumstances of those who perished in the Nobi Great Earthquake, the temples of the Western Pilgrimage Circuit have this time, without regard for the great distance, brought all the sacred images of Kannon Bodhisattva to be enshrined here. A memorial service and opportunity for the general public to form spiritual connections will be conducted in this town as indicated. People from all directions need not undertake the labor of traveling through ten provinces and mountains, nor require lodging expenses, and can easily make pilgrimage to the sacred images and receive temple stamps. This is truly an unprecedented charitable act in response to an unprecedented disaster, and should be recognized as different from ordinary traveling exhibitions of temple treasures.

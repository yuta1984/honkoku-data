The Foolishness of the Earthquake

Too late to get out - trapped in the storehouse
Looking here and there - in the bamboo grove  
Tumbling out from home - in the main street
Fleeing naked - from the bathhouse
Shop attendants working - in the smoke
Courtesans with blackened teeth - in the ditch
Rain-soaked field camps - in Toba
Straightening what's bent - inside the house
　　Sucharaka poku-poku
　　　　Banzairaku
　　　　　Gura-gura

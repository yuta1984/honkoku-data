Complete Map of Kusatsu Hot Springs in Joshu Province

【Main Text】
Origins
This hot spring was discovered during the Yoro era (717-724) of Emperor Gensho, the 45th emperor, when the venerable monk Gyoki from Suganohara Temple in Yamato Province struck his Buddhist staff into this mountain while spreading the Buddhist teachings, and mineral springs gushed forth. Later, Shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo visited on horseback during a hunt at Mount Asama in the 4th year of Kenkyu (1193) and tried bathing in the waters. The Konoe regent Ryuzan also bathed here, and poems to the Twelve Yakushi Deities remain to this day.

The hot springs that well up
in this valley's shade

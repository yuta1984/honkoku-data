1. From around the end of the sixth month of Tenmei 3, year of the Water Rabbit (1783), Mount Asama began to rumble. From around the first day of the seventh month, the rumbling sound became stronger and it began spewing sand. In the northeastern part of Yamanouchi, there is a valley called Ōmon-sawa, and from this valley mud-hot water and fire stones were ejected. The following is a rough summary based on hearsay.

1. Mud-hot water mixed with fire reached a height of approximately 15 jō (about 45 meters) and a width of about 3 ri (approximately 12 kilometers).

1. Along the Tone River, the mud-hot water flowed like a great sea, reaching a height of about 1 jō 4-5 shaku (approximately 4.5 meters). Countless fire stones were swept in, turning the entire river into hot water. Houses, storehouses, tools, and lumber were swept away. The number of people was in the tens of thousands, beyond count, and countless cattle, horses, and livestock as well. Flames erupted from these stones, and the fire stones, lumber, and corpses dammed up the Tone River, then flowed around to the back of Honjō and into the Koyama River. Everywhere one looked appeared like a sea of mud.

1. The areas shown in light gray are where villages, houses, and people were swept away, leaving villages with no trace remaining, or villages struck by fire stones and burned, or where houses and properties were buried in mud, or where people, thinking it was a rain of fire, fled into storehouses and drowned there.

1. The areas shown in indigo are villages severely affected by the influx of mud-hot water. The mud fields occasionally burst into flames, creating a truly terrifying scene that cannot be fully described in writing. Within these villages, mud pushed through about half of some villages, while the other half was heavily obstructed by sand mixed with stones. The conditions varied from village to village, but the scale was so enormous that there was nowhere to clear away the mud and sand. However, since most people fled, there were not many deaths. As shown in the illustration, the total number of villages affected by this natural disaster was over 160.

1. Rural areas, post towns, and pine groves extending over a ri were pushed out like floating islands across a width of about 3 ri.

1. A fire stone measuring 4 by 8 ken (approximately 7.2 by 14.4 meters) was swept down and stopped at the Hiratsuka riverbank. At the ninth hour of the day (around noon) on the eighth day of the seventh month, this fire stone left the Ōuchi village valley of Mount Asama and reached this riverbank at the seventh hour (around 4 PM) of the same day. Traveling a distance of over 20 ri (about 80 kilometers) in about 2 hours was faster than an arrow and swifter than a bullet. Household goods and standing trees caught on these fire stones and were consumed by flames in an unprecedented and terrifying manner.

1. Mount Asama erupted violently from the fifth day of the seventh month and continued ejecting fire stones until the eighth day on a massive scale. Fire stones fell within a 6-7 ri radius around Mount Asama, and beyond the area shown in the illustration, ash and sand fell as far as the northeast regions of Shimotsuke, Shimōsa, and the Sendai area. This may have caused damage to rice fields and farmland. The Shimōsa-Yūki border area along the riverbank was heavily covered, Edo received a light dusting, and various places in Awa and Kazusa received 2-3 sun (about 6-9 cm) of ash. On the seventh and eighth days, there were tremors for two days. Reports of tremors along the Tōkaidō route continue to arrive. This is a preliminary rough account.

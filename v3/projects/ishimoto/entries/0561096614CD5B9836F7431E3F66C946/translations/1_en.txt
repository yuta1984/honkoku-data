Those who could not escape in time were crushed. As for the damaged areas: the Kōrai Gate, which is the main copper gate leading to the main castle compound, fell inward, and subsequently the turrets, earthen walls, and castle keep's kitchen facilities were damaged. The entire moat-side road sank by two to three inches everywhere, and throughout the castle grounds and quarters, cracks appeared everywhere like spider webs. Above the high earthwork behind the quarters near the West Gate, cracks about one shaku wide appeared, and though this earthwork extends for over twenty ken, it sways unsteadily as if about to collapse toward the outer moat. In addition, the stone steps and wooden stairs of the Drum Turret collapsed like an avalanche, the earthen walls above also began falling, the stone walls connecting to the partition gate platform gave way for about two ken, with stones of three to four shaku falling. The West Gate was also twisted, making passage dangerous, so people pass through one at a time hurriedly, carrying rice little by little, about one to (measure) at a time. The earthen walls above the earthwork continuing from the West Gate collapsed, making the outside of the castle visible. The entrance gate to the corridor bridge and earthen walls collapsed in sections of ten to twenty ken each. Along the stable compound road, all the stone paving of the water channels came loose, collapsing and giving way in various places. Most of the earthen walls behind the East Gate guardhouse collapsed, one quarters building designated for damage assessment was destroyed, and the stone walls of the East Gate platform are bulging in several places.

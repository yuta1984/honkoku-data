Due to this unfortunate turn of events, he was ordered to commit formal seppuku, which was an unavoidable situation for all the retainers of the domain.
However, while Lord Kira Kozuke-no-suke remained alive, there was indeed reason to harbor deep resentment in our hearts, but
since Takumi's younger brother Daigaku had been ordered into house arrest, the senior retainers in Edo and other colleagues
had varying degrees of resolve, and when they conveyed their thoughts at that time, they spoke with apparent passion and initiated desperate
consultations, but these came to nothing at all. Therefore, considering this situation unavoidable,
I consulted with two like-minded colleagues and promptly traveled to Harima Province,
where I held discussions with the determined senior retainer Oishi Kuranosuke and other
samurai captains and unit commanders,
and we resolved upon a desperate course of action within the castle. However, before Daigaku's approval or disapproval could be
known, the fact that we harbored vengeful intentions was deemed unwise for Daigaku's sake, as repeatedly conveyed by members of Takumi's clan,
and furthermore, the senior retainers remaining in Edo sent word that seemed like instructions from Daigaku,
saying that if we carried out this desperate act now, it would appear as if we were supporting Daigaku's position, which would be
inappropriate toward the authorities. Thus, even those who had resolved upon desperate action within the castle had no choice but to
disperse. However, since Kozuke-no-suke remained alive, this was not
a final resolution, so we all firmly agreed to
hold further consultations and reach a conclusion. However, since last summer, various considerations and consultations became confused and
prolonged excessively. Therefore, I departed Edo on June 18th of this year and went up to the capital, where I held discussions with Oishi
Kuranosuke and others, and just when our decisive consultation was finally coming together,
on July 18th Daigaku's house arrest was lifted and he was sent to Hiroshima in Aki Province

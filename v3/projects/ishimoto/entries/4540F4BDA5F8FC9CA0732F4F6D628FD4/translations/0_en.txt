Record of Great Earthquakes and Fires in Various Provinces

Nara
On the night of June 14th in the year of the Tiger, shaking began around the 8th hour (around 2 AM) and continued with small tremors until the 6th hour of morning (around 6 AM). On the morning of the 15th, starting from the 5th hour (around 8 AM), a great earthquake occurred. Not a single townhouse remained undamaged, and of course, no one could stay inside their homes. Everyone spent the night in fields or at Kofukuji Temple and other wide open spaces. Not a single person traveled the main roads. Everyone barricaded their doors, and it was impossible to know where anyone was. Every night was spent sleeping outdoors in a pitiful state.

In the southern Shimizu district, houses collapsed. From Honji crossroads westward, about ten houses collapsed. In Narukawa-cho, two-thirds of the street survived.
In the northern Nishi-tegai district, one-third remained. North Handa-cho and Tegai street suffered major collapses north to south. Kawakubo-cho suffered major collapse with only two houses remaining. In the central area, Hosokawa-cho, Kitamuki-cho, and Kita-furo-zushi-cho - these three towns suffered particularly severe collapse with only two houses remaining. Even among these, north of Sanjo street had only minor collapse. The great damage throughout Nara was an unprecedented disaster.
Deaths: approximately 250 people, children: 50 people
Injuries: countless

Iga
In Ueno, the great earthquake began shaking from the 9th hour of the night on the 14th (around midnight). The castle's main gate was severely damaged, and approximately six-tenths of the city collapsed while four-tenths tilted at angles. Fire broke out from Kagi-no-tsuji and burned as far as Kuromon-mae. From Shimagahara to a place called Okawara, ground fissures created what looked like a sea of mud, and the chaos was indescribable.

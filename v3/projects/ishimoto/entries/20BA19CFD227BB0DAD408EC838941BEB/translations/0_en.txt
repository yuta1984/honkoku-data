On the 4th day of the 11th month of Kaei 7, year of the Tiger, around 10 AM, a great earthquake occurred, causing particularly severe damage throughout Osaka city. On the 5th day as well, similar frequent earthquakes occurred with tremendous shaking. From the evening of that same day, a sudden tsunami struck, with several large ships rushing into the river all at once from the mouths of the Aji River and Kizu River, completely destroying all the bridges.

At the Kizu River mouth, ships flowed in as far as Daikoku Bridge, and to the north, up to Aji River Bridge - the number of ships was countless. There were enormous numbers of injured and dead, creating a pitiful scene too terrible to witness. Moreover, on Kansuke Island, the number of dead was beyond counting, and other areas including Terashima, Imaki Shinden, Gessho Island, Kizu, and Namba were all flooded, becoming like a white sea. This was truly an unprecedented disaster of extraordinary magnitude. This records an overview of these events.

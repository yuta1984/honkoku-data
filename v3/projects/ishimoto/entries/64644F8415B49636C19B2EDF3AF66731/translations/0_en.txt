【Main Text】
This time, the rebel earthquake that plots
to overturn the world has immediately appeared
and raised its banner in Yamato Province. Twenty-five years
ago it arose in Kyoto, and in recent years
it has spread at Zenkoji Temple
in Shinano Province, greatly displaying
its power and causing fear
among all people. This ancient and modern
formidable enemy has already
now in Nara,
Koriyama, Iga,
and Goshu
struck down hundreds of people,
with countless wounded.
It has also deployed
to various other places
causing tremendous harm to people.
It laid siege to Kizu in Yamashiro,
burned down Fukui and Yokkaichi,
and still extends its reach
in all eight directions, rampaging wildly.
But renowned brave warriors
are destroying it.

Ode to the Four Directions

Though there are no bonfires lit below each night, the true hot spring waters of Shima never cease to flow, as sung in the Horikawa Hyakushu collection.

This hot spring is beautifully situated on both sides of the river. To the east, one can see Mount Suisho and Mount Ano, while to the west, mountain ridges continue to Sawatari and Kusatsu hot springs. With Mount Hinata and Mount Ogura at the foothills, separated by towering great mountains extending to the border of Echigo Province, and to the south connecting through valleys to Haramachi Nakanojo Station, with waterfalls cascading here and there, and the long flow of the Agatsuma River below, this is indeed a mountain landscape too beautiful to abandon.

The source of Yanagi hot spring dates back to ancient times when Lord Sanada Iganomorti, castle lord of Numata and ruler of this land, granted it to a certain person at the hot spring source and had bathing facilities built, from which time it began to flourish. Later, during the Kanbun era, it reached the lord's attention, and the hot spring notice board was renewed. Furthermore, during the Meiji Restoration, through nationwide surveys of mineral spring water quality, people of all ages from cities and countryside, near and far, come in all four seasons. As years and months pass, households prosper and live harmoniously.

The great benefits of steam baths and the marvelous effects of waterfall baths [Summary of benefits: chronic skin diseases (scabies, Norwegian scabies), stubborn rheumatism, paralysis of hands and feet caused by old injuries, neuralgia, chest tightness and chest pain, indigestion, blood deficiency, liver disease, those with chronic constipation, neuralgia] cure various other ailments.

About ten cho from here, Yakushi Buddha is enshrined in the Ruri Hall, with thick pillars erected and the Hot Spring Shrine seated. Nearby stands an ancient tree so large that oxen could turn around it, probably about a thousand years old, with branches and leaves growing thickly in deep forest. Local products include bracken, Japanese spikenard, shiitake mushrooms, maitake mushrooms, rock mushrooms, mushroom fungi, and hot spring-processed mugwort for souvenirs. Additionally, seafood comes from Hokuriku, and rice and grain are transported across valleys, so this is certainly not a remote canyon.

To comfort the hot spring fatigue of the crowds of travelers, there are geishas who sing very skillfully, and their appearance is beautiful and glamorous. Their voices are finer than the warbler's song, their hair contains the fragrance of plum blossoms, and the sight of their crimson sleeves fluttering against snow-white skin is almost unbearably captivating.

Especially with this prosperous sacred spring's effects, there are no patients, regardless of the severity of their condition, who do not achieve complete recovery. The hot spring pools are pure and contain salt, and are said to go well with tea. Even the hot springs of Kinosaki in Tajima, called the best in Japan, would find it difficult to surpass this, as written and left by a certain Utagawa. This is indeed reasonable.

Feeling for myself the reason why illnesses are cured, I write an outline of ten places and stop my brush as the ink on my inkstone runs out.

Yakuo-zan Cherry Blossoms: Cherry blossom viewing - not a person seems ill
Inari Remaining Snow: In the reflection, does it diminish? Snow remaining on the ridge  
Takano Cuckoo Spirit: Above and beyond, is there a cuckoo on the high peak?
Yamaguchi Waterfall: White waterfall - evening mist in the depths of green leaves
Suisho-zan Autumn Moon: The moon is clear - earth's light piercing the blue sky
Anra-yu Remaining Light: Hot springs rising in the mountain's embrace - lingering summer heat
Ogura Autumn Leaves: Appearing as brocade and silk - evening autumn leaves  
Hinata Ancient Hall: Does the warbler also remember the past in winter seclusion?

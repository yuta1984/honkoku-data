Namazu-ya Fire Temporary Residence

Young man:
Hey, we're really troubled by your frequent earthquakes!

Catfish:
Ah, I'm really in trouble this time too. After the big earthquake recently, the boss at Kashima scolded me harshly, so it's no fun staying at the bottom of the earth. I came out as a joke about temporary housing.

Women:
• You're ridiculous, it's cause for celebration!
• That bearded face can't beat us! It's the same guy from before, you fool, you impudent catfish!
• Hey, they say in Shinshu and Osaka there's grilled catfish kabayaki - how ridiculous!

Young catfish:
You idiots! I can't be made into kabayaki before I even cause a big earthquake!

• Hey, I can see a bunch of bullies coming!

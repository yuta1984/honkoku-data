Even in normal times, they put us through terrible ordeals with money pools and charms, shaving off jewels and noses, but this earthquake knocked us down in one blow. All six of us crashed together and each got injured. Usually with our group, even if we're patted three times each, since there are six of us, we don't get angry unless we're patted eighteen times, but this time we got angry after just once.

Even sitting alongside Kannon and Seishi Bodhisattva, not one of them got injured, but only I got knocked over. To ordinary people's eyes, I must look quite pathetic.

To shake down someone who's acting so dignified with a surprise attack - that earthquake is really a cruel fellow. If it had come at us head-on, I wouldn't have retreated even one step, but because it was a surprise attack, the nine-ring pagoda lost.

It would have been better if you had lived. Thunder: "That's right, even the big gunpowder got knocked down crawling. I decided to quit. I hate rivers."

"Ow, ow, hey, please massage gently. If you have a son, I'll ask your son. This time, if we suffer like this from an earthquake, it's the parent's fault."

"My younger brother snapped clean off at Tennoji Temple in Yanaka, so he looks much better than being bent. Plus he's tall so he doesn't look good either."

Enma: "Hurry, hurry! How could I not treat well those who have become my children? You blue and red demons, apply medicine and bandage them quickly! It must hurt, how pitiful, how pitiful!"

Attendant: "Lord Jizo's anger and Lord Enma's lament, and my being called upon as mediator to help - it's all because of that catfish. What a detestable creature! Unaccustomed work is such a burden, such a burden!"

Jizo: "Having the ground I protect shaken repeatedly is inexcusable before the Buddha. Even Jizo's face [patience] has limits - this is the third time. I've already spoken to Lord Shimazu about this. Prepare yourself, you insolent creature!"

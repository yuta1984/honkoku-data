⑴ This shows the actual conditions of the landslide near Hayashi Village, which suffered the most devastating damage in this disaster. The main stream of the Totsukawa River was temporarily dammed due to this collapse, causing backflow for about 2 ri (approximately 8 km) upstream. The villages of Takatsu, Uenoji, Tanise, and Umiyahara were all submerged under water or buried under soil at depths of 70-80 ken (approximately 127-145 meters) or more. Mark (イ) indicates Hayashi Village, mark (ロ) indicates Uenoji Village, and mark (ハ) indicates the area around Tsunbo Teahouse, where District Chief Tamaki died.

⑵ This shows the actual conditions of Tanise Village submerged underwater, with approximately 60-70 ken (about 109-127 meters) from ground level to the water surface.

⑶ This shows the actual conditions when the Ten-no-gawa River was blocked by landslides near Tsubono, temporarily forming a lake. As a result, the downstream portion of the Ten-no-gawa River reportedly dried up for about three hours.

⑷ This shows the actual conditions of the landslides at Hachitani Village, located above Tsujido Village, and Tsujido Village itself. Initially, when the mountain began rumbling with signs of collapse, people thought that if Hachitani Village's mountain collapsed, Tsujido Village below would also be buried under soil. While the people of Hachitani Village all tried to flee from the disaster and simultaneously rushed to warn Tsujido Village, the collapse had already begun from several dozen cho (3-4 km) up the mountain. Both Hachitani Village and Tsujido Village were equally buried under soil, creating a tragic situation where neither people nor houses remained intact. Tsujido Village had 28 households and formed a small market center in the area, even having a post office, but only one temple remained while everything else was completely destroyed.

⑸ This shows the actual conditions of Takatsu Village underwater. In Kitamura, there was a shrine called Takatsu-no-miya on a small hill to the right of the road, with a large fir tree in front of the shrine. Now only about one shaku (approximately 30 cm) of the tree is visible above the water surface.

⑹ This depicts how disaster victims in the affected areas had their lives saved through the assistance of police officers and charitable individuals.

⑺ This illustrates approximately one-fifth of the disaster-affected areas in Totsukawa-go. Within this area, mark (イ) indicates Tsubono, mark (ロ) indicates Tsujido Village, mark (ハ) indicates Osadono, mark (ニ) indicates Umiyahara, mark (ホ) indicates Uenoji, and mark (ヘ) indicates the location of Hayashi Village.

The time was the evening of June 14th, Year 7 of Kaei, Year of the Tiger (1854), around 8 o'clock, when a great earthquake struck the four provinces of Owari, Ise, Ōmi, and Mino. The post stations along the Tōkaidō route - Narumi-juku, Miya-juku, and along the Nagoya highway: Hagiwara, Kanie, Magome, Saya-juku, Tsushima, Gotsu, and Tennō - suffered the most severe damage. This day coincided with a festival, causing great crowds and confusion at temples, dojos, and other establishments, not to mention countless townhouses that collapsed. In the north, the areas around Inuyama and Komaki, and in the south, extending to Noma, Utsumi, and Morosaki, as well as west of the Saya River in Ise Province - Nagashima, Kuwana, Yokkaichi, Ōi, and Wakebe - all suffered extensive collapse without exception. Moreover, fires broke out, resulting in many deaths and injuries. Similarly, Ishiyakushi, Shōno, Kameyama, Seki, and Sakanoshita-juku were completely destroyed. In Ōmi Province, around Tsuchiyama, Minakuchi, and Ishibe-juku, and to the northwest in Mino Province - Ōgaki, Nangū, Tarui, Kashiwabara, Samegai, Takamiya, Echi River, and Musa - all suffered damage, along with countless mountains in the northwest that collapsed from the tremendous tremors. The earthquake finally subsided around 6:30 AM on the 15th. Since then, small earthquakes continue daily. Because this is such a rare great earthquake, I record this summary to inform and reassure the people.

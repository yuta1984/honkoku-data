Public Announcement
The townspeople were all shaken house by house in great celebration, in astonished hell we humbly submit. Calming down, regarding my personal matter, recently the Edo-mae Catfish Grand Kabayaki establishment flourished greatly on the main street, but due to the shaking and subsequent fire, from house to storehouse and all property were shaken up, and we were ordered to face turmoil - what a tremendous time, gratefully suffering damage from ancient times to now. Furthermore, tonight, due to grief, the city suffers with difficulty obtaining rice. From now on, we shall offer "what-to-do soup," immediate treatment for bruises and dislocations, with especially good manners for world reform. May the people's hearths be prosperous and lively, and we humbly pray for your mighty influence above all else.

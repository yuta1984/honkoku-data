Tsunami on the Northeast Coast

The actual damage situation beginning at 7 PM on June 15, Meiji 29 (1896), with 31 violent earthquakes occurring through June 16

Iwate Prefecture:
- Kamaishi: approximately 5,000 deaths, swept away
- Near Sakari town: 4,000 deaths, over 2,000 houses swept away
- Near Otsuchi town: 600 deaths, over 500 houses swept away  
- Yamada town: most of the town swept away, combined with surrounding areas over 300 houses swept away, 1,000 deaths

Miyagi Prefecture: 3,103 deaths, 550 injured, 973 houses swept away or damaged
- Utatsu village in Motoyoshi district: of 601 households, all houses swept away, over 600 deaths, 200 injured

Aomori Prefecture: 
- Sannohe district: over 50 houses swept away

Due to the above, telegraph communications have been cut throughout the three prefectures. On the Rikuchu coast, three foreign steamships were also driven ashore. Ministers from various countries have all sent telegrams to their home countries.

Of approximately 240 serious criminals dispatched to work in the Oga region of Iwate Prefecture, about 100 died, and many of the accompanying officials also perished. In the Minato town area of the same prefecture, sailing boats and over 100 large and small fishing vessels had their bows driven into houses, breaking through the siding - truly an unspeakable disaster.

Since this day was the Boy's Festival (May 5th by the lunar calendar), banquets were being held vigorously in each village and town, making the death toll particularly high.

The ○ marks in the diagram indicate the areas of most severe damage. The black lines are railway lines. According to repeated reports, Iwate Prefecture had 22,186 deaths and 1,244 injuries. Aomori Prefecture had 308 deaths and 140 injuries, with 480 houses swept away or destroyed. Details for Miyagi Prefecture are still unknown.

Addition: In Iwate Prefecture, there were also major fires on the day of the disaster, so the exact number of houses is unknown. The dual disaster of water and fire was truly not of this human world. In places where the tsunami was highest, it reached over 5 jō (approximately 15 meters), and the sight of it surging forward was truly astonishing.

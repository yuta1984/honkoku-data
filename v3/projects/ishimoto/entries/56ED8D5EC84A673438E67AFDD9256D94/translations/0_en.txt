Mount Fuji originally appeared overnight during the reign of Emperor Koan, the sixth human emperor. Later, Prince Yamato Takeru opened up the mountain, establishing it as the foremost sacred peak among the three countries. The deity enshrined there is Princess Konohana-sakuya-hime, whose divine efficacy is well known to all people. In the sixty-first year, which is a kanoe-saru (Metal Monkey) year, both men and women climb the mountain. This year being a special sacred year, both men and women gather in crowds for pilgrimage.

In mid-July of this year, a foreigner petitioned to climb Mount Fuji. When this foreigner attempted to climb Mount Fuji, around the seventh and a half stations, clouds suddenly appeared and wind began to blow. From within the clouds came a voice saying: "I am the Stone Deity of Ko-mitake, located in the middle of this sacred mountain. This mountain is Japan's foremost sacred and spiritually efficacious peak. Foreigners must not climb it. You must descend immediately." So it is said.

【Thunder god's dialogue, from upper right to lower left】
〽There seem to be quite a few injured, since the
commotion is so great,
it would be best to keep things
as quiet as possible

〽At festivals here and there
young people are making
a racket, and this too
is due to drinking

〽Please take
your medicine

〽What was greatly damaged is
truly troubling for my son
as well...
Speaking of which,
long ago there was
a palanquin bearer,
a cloud-helper, what is he
now?

〽Not a cloud-helper, I fell
from the clouds

〽I fell indeed, but on a dog, got my knee
bitten, and that fellow's teeth
are said to be
poisonous

〽For dogs,
brown sugar is
medicine

〽Probably around eight o'clock

〽Whose drum is this? This is what happens
when you play such jokes

〽At least my important horns
are unharmed

〽Mother,
did father's horns
break?
Mother must be
quite troubled

【Front section damaged】
...such injuries, please rest and recover
most important
most important

〽I was drinking,
so otherwise I wouldn't have
fallen. I'm different from
tigers and
such creatures

〽Does your back
hurt
at
all?

〽I fell indeed, but
"three years on a stone"—
going out somewhere once,
I've learned my lesson

〽Thank you for all your trouble,
please keep things
as quiet as possible

〽If only I had stopped
after just one drink

〽Here, the dish is ringing,
let's lay it outside

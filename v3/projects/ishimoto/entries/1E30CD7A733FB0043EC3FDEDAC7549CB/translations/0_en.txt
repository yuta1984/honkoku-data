〽From afar, one can hear the rumors
Come closer, customers, and witness this pitiful sight
Curious onlookers in fashionable amateur dress
If we topple the main gate of the pleasure quarter tonight
Immediately, most wickedly, fire spreads across exactly five districts

●
〽Such blazing scenes cause even beautiful voices to falter in confusion
Many courtesans in the burning Naka-no-cho｜the flames grow ever fiercer
Into this scene, old storehouses and earthen walls

■
〽I survive without dying, struck sharply in Harima
Burned by the fierce assault of midnight, hat swaying in the wind
Returning home? People on rooftops　●〽The wealthy with burning hearts will have their sleeping places burned
Those with greedy faces, burned beyond measure, compared to that house　■〽fires in various places also
Die out, in the mountain ranges of Shitaya and Ueno, fire bells to the west, heading north
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Let's eat rice porridge, burned silk garments

The illustrations on both sides presented here were created as a memorial to the great earthquake that occurred in Kumamoto Prefecture on the night of July 28, 1889 (Meiji 22). They are based on photographs showing the actual conditions of damage in the urban area of Takahashi Town (Kawabata district) in Akita District of the same prefecture, and ground fissures near the artillery battery (former Heizaemon turret floor) within Kumamoto Castle under the jurisdiction of the Sixth Division. The illustrations were created from these photographs and engraved in the style of Western photographic art. Among many photographs, these two scenes were specifically selected for engraving because these two locations represented the most tragic areas among all the damaged sites.

The earthquake disaster in Kumamoto Prefecture on the night of July 28, 1889 (Meiji 22) was truly a great earthquake disaster rarely heard of in modern times. The damaged area extended across one city and nine districts, with over 890 ground fissures, and casualties among people and livestock were not few. According to historians, this earthquake disaster should be permanently recorded in history alongside nine previous earthquakes that occurred in Kyushu in ancient times: Hakuhō 7 (December), Tenpyō 16 (May), Jōgan 9 (May), Nin'na 3 (July), Kanbun 2 (November), Kyōhō 8 (November), Kyōhō 10 (September), An'ei 8 (September), and Kansei 4 (February), as a great earthquake disaster that should be remembered for posterity.

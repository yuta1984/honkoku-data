Chobo-kure Chon-gare

"Let's decide from behind, take care of your body, the storehouse is fragile, pull it~~~
Escape to the front!" "What's this commotion, help us!"

At the fourth hour of the second day, suddenly heaven and earth shook, intimate words between my wife and me about the earthquake
Scattered by the catfish, wearing only a loincloth, both my body and my son
Shrunk up, chanting Buddhist prayers and Nichiren invocations all at once
Rolling out to the front, on a single door plank, at the boundary between life and death

Even in such circumstances, thick-skinned as I am, I searched to see
if I had dropped the large bundle of money inherited from my father
Oh my, how terrible! At some point I had dropped it somewhere, what to do?
When I searched thoroughly, it had shrunk up from extreme fear
and hidden near my protruding navel - well, this gave me some peace of mind. If even
Kashima-san of great importance were staying at this lodging, such hardships
would probably not come to pass. All night long, wandering about confused, over in that
corner the inn that the manzai performers had raised, with their performance hats
just as they were, without even sleeping mats, requesting shelter and returning
to my original self, through the divine virtue of the gods and the benevolence of the authorities◎

Ho-wo-i

The time was around 8:00 AM on July 15, Meiji 21 (1888), when Mount Bandai in Yama District, Iwashiro Province, Fukushima Prefecture (commonly called Aizu Fuji) suddenly erupted. The area of collapse was approximately 2 ri square, and the disaster-affected area extended to approximately 6 ri square. About 400 people were buried, with approximately 900 or more injured. In Iwase Village, 36 houses were damaged and 56 houses collapsed. Furthermore, the ejected earth and sand blocked the waterway of the Hinokihara River, causing Hinokihara Village to become almost entirely a marsh. The three villages of Oshisawa, Akimoto, and Hosono reportedly became covered with mountains of debris. In addition, the villages of Mine, Shibuya, Shimizu, Nagasaka, Numakura, Kawakami, Yosan, Sango, Wakamiya, Horikiri, Shirakijo, Myoke, and others suffered countless casualties among both people and livestock. This was truly an unprecedented natural disaster of recent times, and its tragic conditions are beyond estimation. For details, we defer to the various newspaper reports, and here we record only the general outline.

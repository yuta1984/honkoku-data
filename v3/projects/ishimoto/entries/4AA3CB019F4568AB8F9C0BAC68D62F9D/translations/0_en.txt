"I always thought this fellow was elusive and hard to see clearly, but I never thought he would do such a thing. Now all the eight million gods have departed for Izumo, and I alone am keeping watch. But with my strength alone, I cannot kill him, so I must somehow capture him alive and send him to Izumo to have his crimes judged."

"Wait there! Don't run away, great catfish! Unlike a sea bream, you're hard to catch. Even though I'm a god, I'm just one person - I can't carry this fellow who lurks at the bottom of the earth all the way to Izumo, nor can I shoulder him. Catfish, now that I've caught you halfway, I cannot let you escape and neglect my duty as guardian. Ah, what good timing - eel! Quickly grab this fellow and take him to the shrine at Izumo!"

Eel: "How, how can I? Such a large catfish cannot be carried by divine hands or human hands!"

"Well, that's troublesome. Ah, I have a good idea. If it cannot be done by human hands..." "Then how shall we do it?"

"It's best to quickly reduce him to nothing."

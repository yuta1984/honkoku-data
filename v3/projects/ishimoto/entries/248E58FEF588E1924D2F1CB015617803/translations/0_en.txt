Kashima fears,
Making Daikoku's land shake

[Editorial note: The "Kashima fears" on the right page has been transcribed elsewhere, so the existing text remains with additions, and the main title "Enma no Ko" has been newly transcribed on the left.]

【Title】
Children of Enma (King of Hell)

Enma:
I'm so busy I can't stand it! Everyone is asking me to make them my children, but my body feels like it's turning to powder. This must be the real "Enma powder."

【Song in the upper center】
The watchmen of
The six realms' crossroads
And the courtesans too
Have become
The amusing
Children of Enma

Woman says:
I am a town girl, but as this year ends, how can I become accustomed to this journey to the underworld with its temporary pillow? Whether dozing, dreaming, or half-awake, crushed before I could even wake up, ground into powder to be drunk with water by someone who doesn't care about my body - please pity me, Lord Enma, and take me as your child.

Blind man says:
I am a newcomer with my family of five. Please think of us as your own children from now on, and grant us a place that is even slightly better. That Mountain of Needles looks fine, but truly, beneath the needles is terrifying.

Child says:
[Added note] Papa and Mama are children of Jizo.

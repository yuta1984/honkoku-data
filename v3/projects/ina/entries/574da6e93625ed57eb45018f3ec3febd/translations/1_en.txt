Document of Submission

Item: Regarding the matter of stone cutters in our village, we have thoroughly investigated and there is not even one person other than those listed in this year's record. Given this situation, we have instructed the stone cutters to conduct themselves with complete honesty and propriety even when traveling, and we acknowledge this responsibility. Should you hear that there are those we have excluded from the records and concealed, please report this to the authorities, as we acknowledge. Given this understanding, no matter what punishment may be imposed upon us, we will harbor no resentment whatsoever. For future reference, therefore, as stated herein.

After retirement (or perhaps), when their sons succeed to the family headship, if they are reappointed to their former positions, they return to their previous arrangements. At present, there are cases where wakadoshiyori (junior councilors) and ōgobanngashira (captains of the great guard) have made such modifications upon being restored to office, but the old customs remain.

The retinue processions of retired families have gradually become more luxurious, losing the military substance of warrior houses. Ultimately, this is because they have come to understand that it is acceptable to imitate the retinue arrangements of their peers and other officials. [The above is repeated from the previous page]

There may be such meaning behind this as well. For this reason, there is the lord's intention that has been announced, so hereafter (perhaps) according to the old customs, those appointed from among the gofudai and tozama should modify their retinues and procession equipment to match those of the gokatte officials. If so, all officials of ten thousand koku and above should each understand this matter accordingly.

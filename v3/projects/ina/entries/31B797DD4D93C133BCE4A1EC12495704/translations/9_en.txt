The retinues correspond to those positions. Those appointed from among the gofudai (hereditary vassals) and tozama (outside lords), in all cases, first restrain themselves regarding carrying boxes, box cords, palanquins, sun covers, umbrella bags, etc., and modify their retinues in various ways according to gokatte practices. After retirement (or perhaps), when their sons succeed to the family headship, if they are reappointed to their former positions, they return to their previous arrangements. At present, there are cases where wakadoshiyori (junior councilors) and ōgobanngashira (captains of the great guard) have made such modifications upon being restored to office, but the old customs remain.

The retinue processions of retired families have gradually become more luxurious, losing the military substance of warrior houses. Ultimately, this is because they have come to understand that it is acceptable to imitate the retinue arrangements of their peers and other officials.

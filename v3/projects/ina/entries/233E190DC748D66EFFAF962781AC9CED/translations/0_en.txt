(Pasted note)
"Record of when granted leave to return to one's domain"
October 15th

The day before yesterday, a formal letter signed jointly by the council of elders arrived, so at the hour of the Rooster (6 PM) I prepared my retinue and wore court dress (fukusa kosode and hemp kamishimo), then proceeded to Nishinomaru at 6:30 PM. I reported my arrival to the senior inspectors and inspectors, conveying this through the lord's attendant monks.

The inspectors instructed me to participate in practice, so I went to the great corridor and took my seat with my back toward the folding screen from the domain area. All the ceremonial announcers, senior inspectors, and inspectors were present. We completed the practice in order and withdrew temporarily.

After the council of elders arrived at the castle, the inspectors directly instructed me to go to the formal greeting area, so I went to wait in the great corridor.
However, when the Three Branch Houses made their rounds, I performed the formal greetings.

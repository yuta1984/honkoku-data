[the matter] he requested of Nakayama Reizaemon, retainer of Lord Matsudaira Iga-no-kami, was unclear in its details, and consequently he was ordered to house confinement by the magistrate's office ruling. Regarding this matter, as a matter of propriety to his superiors, it reached the point where formal inquiry procedures were initiated, and since this was no trivial matter without possibility of clemency, his reckless involvement in a matter that tarnished the lord's reputation should have resulted in severe punishment. However, yesterday his house confinement was lifted, as Lord Toda Hyūga-no-kami personally announced at the magistrate's office, concluding the matter. Furthermore, Lord Settsu-no-kami also conveyed his benevolent consideration, and through various acts of compassion, four hyō were confiscated from his stipend allocation, and he was appointed as ashigaru foot soldier for escort duty with a stipend of 18 hyō and provisions for two people. His secretary duties were, of course, terminated. Henceforth, he must focus primarily on maintaining discretion in all matters. He will be under the supervision of the ashigaru head going forward.

Document of Settlement Agreement Submitted

Whereas I had inherited and continued the household succession (atoshiki) of Takichi, a petition was submitted to the authorities requesting divorce due to incompatibility with my adoptive mother. After thorough inquiry into the circumstances, [the authorities] were concerned that if divorce were to proceed, the future of Takichi's household succession would be uncertain, and out of sympathy, they graciously mediated and advised that both parties should engage in thorough discussion to reach an amicable settlement. Accordingly, they arranged for the situation to remain as it has been, ensuring that all needs would be met without inconvenience, for which we are deeply grateful and humbled. Under these circumstances, with the adoptive mother's understanding, all matters have been transferred, and henceforth I shall dutifully serve her with filial devotion and carefully maintain the household succession, living together harmoniously. Therefore, this settlement agreement is hereby submitted.

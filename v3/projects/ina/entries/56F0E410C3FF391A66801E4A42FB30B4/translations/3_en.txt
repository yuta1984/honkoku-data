If it is an upper domain forest (ue go-rin), one should report back after returning, but order immediate clearing.

1. Regarding upland fields and mountain fields where crops do not grow well and are left abandoned, or where forests have been allowed to grow, order immediate clearing and restoration to original development. However, for those who cannot manage development due to insufficient resources, order that they ensure uninterrupted tax payment through medicinal plants or, depending on the location, grasslands or timber.

1. Regarding the matter of rice field conversion (tahata-nari): After inspection, for places that have unavoidably become converted rice fields over the years due to lack of water, order the cutting down of ridges. If the ridges remain unchanged even after several years, first order their removal and arrange for annual crop inspection after standing crops.

1. Regarding residential plots (yashiki): Beyond official residential plot requests, for portions not requested as retirement exemptions or official announcements that extend to future residential plots, have them submit surveying requests as newly developed land, and distribute measuring ropes for wild fields and grass lands.
Furthermore, strictly reduce these.

1. Regarding dry field conversion (hatake-ta-nari): Due to insufficient irrigation channels in villages, this may interfere with old rice fields, and we hear of places without complaints. For this current reform, order dry field conversion, and in case of drought years, order the planting of dry field crops so as not to interfere with main rice fields, and it would be appropriate to announce that complaints should be filed in years when dry field crops are planted. For such places, order that water be kept in winter fields, rice straw be dried with little water to achieve good drying, and rice grains be sorted.

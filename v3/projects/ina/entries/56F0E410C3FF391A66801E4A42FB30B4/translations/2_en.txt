whether there are reasons for land exchanges, thoroughly investigate this matter. Survey the rice fields in all four directions using adjacent lands, and if there are particularly wide parcels, order the reconstruction of ridges and embankments.

1. Regarding irrigation fees (i-dai) and road maintenance fees (michi-dai):
After the land inspection (go-hai-chi), for areas where land confiscation (hiki-kata) will be ordered successively, if there are no discrepancies after site inspection, make marginal notes in the copy of the official land registry (o-mizuchō). However, depending on the location, there are cases where irrigation and road fees are reduced when dry fields become replacement lands, and since this has been established for years, there may be cases where confiscation is unnecessary at this time, but this should be investigated.

1. Regarding the matter of dealing with poor-quality land (akusho): Inspect the locations, and for places that can be restored through maintenance work, consider methods and arrangements for public works.
However, if the land is not particularly poor quality, order that from this year the confiscation be lifted, and after crop inspection, request annual crop inspection. After examining for four or five years, if it is finally determined to be poor land, order tax reduction (men-sage) or lower-grade tax exemption (gege-men).

1. Conversely, if the locations of confiscated rice fields and dry fields are unclear, they should be lifted.

1. For places shaded by forests where confiscation has been reduced, as ordered during the Shōtoku era, cut back branches and leaves, and if they still create shade, order the landowners to selectively cut trees. Furthermore,

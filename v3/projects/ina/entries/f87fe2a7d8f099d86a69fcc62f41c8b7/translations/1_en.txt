I write this brief letter to you. I trust that you are all in good health and diligently carrying out your duties, which I find most gratifying. I am deeply grateful for the care you provided during the Shōnin's stay in your locality. Furthermore, regarding the letters to be delivered to the senior retainers and the officials in charge of temples and shrines, I would be most obliged if you could kindly present them on our behalf. I write this letter both to express my gratitude and to make this request. I humbly ask for your continued favor.

23rd day of the 10th month　Shūryōken (seal)

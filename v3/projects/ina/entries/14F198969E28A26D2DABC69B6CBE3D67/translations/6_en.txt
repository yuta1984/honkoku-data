[From the third line]
1. To myself:
　　When the imperial message was delivered, Noto-no-kami moved down about one tatami mat and was seated, and
　　when I came out to receive the envoy, he was seated in the upper position as before.
1. The court physicians Tsujimoto Ishun-in and Manase Yōan-in both came forward
　　and reported on the patient's condition.
1. From the advance guard Hanabusa Ōkura, a medical report and the names of the physicians were read out,
　　and three copies of documents listing the names of those present were submitted from him to Noto-no-kami.
1. A retainer brought out noshi-awabi (ceremonial dried abalone), and tea service was offered, but the advance guard politely
　　declined with a bow, and the service was withdrawn.
1. The advance guard came over to where I was waiting in the service area and
　　informed me about the reception arrangements.
1. As initially, I placed my fan outside the threshold and advanced as shown in the diagram:
　　"Regarding Saemon-no-jō's serious illness,
　　you have sent an imperial envoy,
　　this inquiry is an extremely blessed and grateful occasion. Please convey that the reception
　　went well."
　　Noto-no-kami said he would "report this," and immediately I also rose from my seat,
　　held my fan, took the lead, and this time also
　　escorted the imperial envoy to the right side, to the edge of the threshold sill, and Noto-no-kami's farewell bow was completed.

June 10th

1. Regarding Saemon-no-jō's critical illness, Daizen-no-daibu submitted a report this morning.
   Concerning this matter, there will likely be an imperial envoy dispatched to make inquiries,
   but since Daizen-no-daibu is also ill,
   we sent a messenger yesterday evening to request someone to serve as his proxy in receiving the imperial envoy.

1. It is said that when I myself have conflicts, the backup arrangement has been entrusted to Honda Shimōsa-no-kami.

1. After four o'clock, wearing formal attire with abbreviated sleeves and a hemp summer garment, I went to Daizen-no-daibu's
   upper residence.
   Note: Since Saemon-no-jō's residential estate is too small, the imperial envoy will be received
   at the upper residence.

1. Guided by an attendant, I went to the living quarters' reception room, called for the steward, and
   discussed today's matters.
   We also discussed in detail the arrangements for the room where the imperial envoy would be received, the greeting and seeing-off procedures, etc.

　　　We saw off the palanquin and immediately went up from the front entrance.
1. Shimōsa-no-Ōkura, who had been stationed at the entrance hall's outer area, also returned with me to his original
　　seat and offered greetings to the guide.
1. The chief retainer also came out and exchanged greetings.
1. As I was asked to make courtesy rounds to the senior councilors only as Saemon-no-jō's representative,
　　I immediately ordered the escort to be prepared, offered greetings to Shimōsa-no-Ōkura as well, and departed.
　　　However, the formal statement was prepared by the other party, and the sword-keeper
　　　was informed through a monk to handle the arrangements.
1. I changed into summer clothing of crepe and banana fiber kamishimo.
1. Shimōsa was apparently asked to make courtesy rounds as Daizen-no-Dayū's representative.
1. The imperial envoy's business was completed by around half past nine o'clock.
1. At the end of the courtesy round route, in front of Lord Abe Ise's gate, Daizen-no-Dayū's
　　caretaker was waiting, so I informed them from the palanquin that
　　the courtesy rounds had been completed without incident.
1. I returned home after half past eight o'clock.

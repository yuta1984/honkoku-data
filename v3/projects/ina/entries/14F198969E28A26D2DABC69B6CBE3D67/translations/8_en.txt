[From the sixth line]
1. Regarding Saemon-no-jō, while he was serving his duty stationed at the Tamari room, his illness gradually
　　worsened, and this morning it was reported to Izumi-no-kami, who was on duty, that his condition had become critical.
　　The matter was urgently reported to the Goshōsaban, and
　　an imperial envoy was dispatched.
　　To Saemon-no-jō's residence, a Goshōsaban was sent
　　as an imperial envoy, though there is no precedent for this. On the 11th day of the 11th month of Tenpō 9, when Matsudaira
　　Etchū-no-kami was critically ill, there was an inquiry.
　　Most cases have been investigated based on precedents of imperial envoys.
　　If today's inquiry is not completed, it may extend to tomorrow.
　　Recently, there was a similar case in Hikone.
　　When preparations for the imperial envoy were underway, it was postponed to the next day. [Above in red ink]

October 27th
1. Having been ordered to attend the Noh performance celebrating His Excellency the Right General's recovery from smallpox, I dressed in formal noshi-me long kamishimo and went to the castle at around 6 o'clock.

1. When I appeared at my seat during the senior councillors' arrival at the castle, I was informed by Deputy Inspector (metsuke) Tsugita Yozaemon that Makino Suo-no-kami, who was supposed to serve as seat magistrate for the Seiko room today, was ill, and that I should serve in his place.
   However, I informed him that I would receive the meal early, as per precedent.

1. Since Mizuno Sakon-dono was also appointed as seat magistrate for the Seiko room, I coordinated well with him in advance.

1. At the time for formal reporting, I went around to the large hall (ohiroma), and together with the high-ranking families (koke-shu), all the protocol officers (sojaban) took their seats in the second room. After the lord's appearance and the formal audience were completed, we watched the Noh performance in the third room. Around the time the second piece began, we received our meal in the Yanagi room's service area.
   Note: Since Itakura Awa-no-kami was also serving as seat magistrate for the Bamboo room, I coordinated with him to receive the meal. Details as shown in the diagram.

Regarding the matter of firewood payment rice for the prefectural administration: Up until now, we have been collecting payments in seasonal installments, so the payment for firewood cut this year will only be fully settled by next year (the Year of the Rooster). We have been proceeding according to the aforementioned regulations, but due to consecutive poor harvests in recent years, wages for woodcutters and daily laborers for river transport have soared, and the advance payments from the accounting bureau have accumulated to an enormous amount, causing great concern.

Currently, the accounting of monetary and grain transactions at the bureau has been limited to two months, creating severe difficulties. Therefore, we had no choice but to convert over 2,000 ryō in advance payments from previous officials to formal contracts from the Year of the Snake until this year. However, a ferry crossing has now opened at Shimokawara, and one at Kamikawara is expected to open soon. When this happens, woodcutters and day laborers will no longer need to struggle repeatedly with river transport during the cold season, making it possible to request further loans through contracts. However, most of the advance payments are now difficult to manage.

Once the firewood arrives and the stockpiling inspection is completed, we would like to provide ten ken worth to each household as desired, regardless of whether they are samurai or foot soldiers, for cash payment. The remaining timber would be sold to interested parties in town, accounts settled with contractors, and then a general accounting prepared with former officials to complete the repayment of previous loans. Going forward, we would like the firewood administration to be definitively abolished. We humbly submit this matter for your consideration.

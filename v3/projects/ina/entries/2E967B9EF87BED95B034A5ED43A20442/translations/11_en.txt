Regarding the matter of the sake brewing house and storehouse, this is exactly as the officials in charge of local products have been successively informed. No matter how Zensuke may present his claims, even if he were to speak truthfully based on his understanding from the time when the property was mortgaged in previous years, it would be quite difficult to excuse at this point.

Since a long period has passed, there is no discrepancy with the record book in my possession, so regardless of how Zensuke may present his case, I humbly petition that you give thorough understanding to the aforementioned matter. Should there be any discrepancies, I will explain orally when inquired. The above.

Regarding the clause that when no longer needed, it would be returned to me, they showed deep understanding and issued a directive that I should receive a written document stating that when no longer needed, it would definitely be returned to me. I accepted this and submitted a petition for temporary transfer, but it was not approved and the written document has still not been provided to this day. When I informed them that there was no consultation about whether Rokubei was aware of this matter and that I had no recollection of making such arrangements, perhaps he developed hopes for a petition thinking that everything had been abandoned until now and would eventually be returned to him. Since he makes various claims with no foundation based purely on his own convenience, presenting convenient petitions, this matter may be under deliberation, which is why it has been delayed until now.

The various points that Zensuke claims are each based solely on his own convenience and completely differ from the original circumstances. This Rokubei has always been inclined toward falsehood, and not limited to this matter, while serving in official duties, he has conducted everything in this manner with cunning, living this way until now. Eventually, this led to such disgraceful circumstances that it became a matter of public shame, and after making explanations, he fled. Subsequently, his son Zensuke has inherited this disposition and continues to make various scheming claims.

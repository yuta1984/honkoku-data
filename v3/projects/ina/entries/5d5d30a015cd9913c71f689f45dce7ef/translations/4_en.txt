Recently, we solicited donations from various places for the perpetual Daidai Okagura (sacred dance performance) at our shrine's Daigongen deity. Through everyone's devout faith, this endeavor has been successfully accomplished. Therefore, every year in the sixth month, we will unfailingly perform prayers before our shrine's altar for the long-lasting military fortune and prosperity of the lord's household above, and for the safety of all people, abundant harvests, and eternal peace between heaven and earth below.

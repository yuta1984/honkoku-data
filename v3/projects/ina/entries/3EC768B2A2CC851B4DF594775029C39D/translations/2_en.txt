Epitaph for Master Tenzan
　　　　　　　Composed by Nagamura Kagami of Hirado

On the twenty-ninth day of the second month of Kyōwa 3 (1803), year of the Water Boar, the Master passed away at the age of fifty-nine. He was buried at Shinju-in within Kōdai-ji temple in Nagasaki. The following month, news of his death reached the guest quarters in Edo. I then informed those who had been on friendly terms with the Master, and we wept and mourned together. After more than a month, a letter from home arrived. It contained a letter written by the Master, which I found strange to see - it was indeed in the Master's handwriting. The letter stated: "Recently, during my travels, I arrived in Nagasaki and, through connections with the estate official Yoshikawa who manages the treasury office of a great domain, I was able to establish an exchange."

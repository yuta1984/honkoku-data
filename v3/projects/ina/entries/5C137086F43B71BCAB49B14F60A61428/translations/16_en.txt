1. 7th month, 9th day: By imperial mercy, appointed as substitute

Inagaki
During the reign of Shinnyoin-sama
1. Kyōhō 16 (Year of the Boar), 7th month, 9th day: We humbly request mercy so that Denzaemon's wife and children do not perish from starvation. He was a person employed for plastering work, and although he has a legitimate son who is now fifteen years old, the son cannot inherit the family trade. Moreover, recently there have been no periods of service, making it difficult to establish a substitute. However, although his position is that of a newcomer and we are deeply apologetic, since he has a legitimate son, we humbly request one measure of mercy. Due to the actual circumstances, please grant Denzaemon's legitimate son the position of substitute, with a stipend of three ryō and provisions for two people, and appointment to the advance guard unit.

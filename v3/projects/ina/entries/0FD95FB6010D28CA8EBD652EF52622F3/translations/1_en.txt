We acknowledge the matter that you have carefully considered and reported.

Item 1: Regarding the matter of conferring the title of Great Master (Daishi) on Kakuban Shonin of Negoroji Temple on the occasion of his 550th memorial anniversary next year, since there are precedents for this, Chiishakuin Koikebo has made this request. We will address this matter later.

Item 2: Due to the financial difficulties at Sento Imperial Palace, a document regarding the silver shortage for three years of expenses has been sent over. We have also acknowledged the report regarding the Empress Dowager's financial situation.

Item 3: Regarding Nishi Honganji Shinmon's request for court visits after his ordination, and the main temple's desire to also participate in court visits as a guardian at that time, the denso (court liaison officials) have reported that this has been approved as requested. We understand there are no other obstacles to this.

Item 4: We are pleased to hear that your health continues to be good. Everyone here is also doing well without incident.

That is all.

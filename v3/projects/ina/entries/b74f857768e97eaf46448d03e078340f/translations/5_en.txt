The purpose of burying [the remains] at the bottom of the new monument is written in the inscription on the back of the stone. This is undoubtedly the historic site of Takeda, but currently there is no enclosure, and sometimes defilement by cattle and horses occurs. Masterless samurai from the same province as well as those with hereditary connections have contributed funds, and we village folk wish to take care of erecting stone walls around the grave site in a three-ken square. When we petitioned for this, we were told that since it is not a major undertaking, it would be approved as requested, and regarding this matter, an inquiry should be made to Fukaya Tōtōmi-no-kami-sama, with consultation to the Temples and Shrines Magistrate's Office, and then instructions

should be given accordingly. We humbly acknowledge and accept all of the above. Therefore, we submit this written pledge as stated.

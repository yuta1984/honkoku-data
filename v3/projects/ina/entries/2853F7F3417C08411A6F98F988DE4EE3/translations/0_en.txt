We have respectfully read your letter.
His Excellency the Shogun is in excellent spirits,
which brings us great joy, and we feel the same way
as you do. Regarding the matter at hand, the documents
concerning the auspicious days and official ceremonial days for next year, the Year of the Horse,
have arrived. We have been informed that the court nobles (densōshū)
have requested that you also attend
our gathering. We are grateful for your notification. We have
received the two aforementioned
documents. We look forward to hearing from you again
in the future. With utmost respect and reverence.

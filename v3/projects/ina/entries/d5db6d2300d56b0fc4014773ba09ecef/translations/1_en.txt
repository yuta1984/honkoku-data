A Written Pledge Submitted

Regarding the matter of stone cutters (stonemasons) in our village, we have thoroughly investigated all persons in the village and submitted this report. There are no others beyond those listed. Furthermore, when going out to work as stone cutters, we shall not take on stone cutter apprentices while traveling. Moreover, we have instructed them in detail to thoroughly investigate the actual conditions of their business destinations, and they have understood and acknowledged each point. Should there be any matters of inadequate investigation beyond this point that come to your attention later, please immediately report from that source. Even if any punishment is imposed upon us as a result, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. We affix our seals jointly for future reference.

Therefore, as stated above

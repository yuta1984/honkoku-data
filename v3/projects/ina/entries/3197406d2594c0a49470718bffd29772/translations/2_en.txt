When we sent people to inquire about explanation methods and other matters, on April 4th they went to the lodging for official duties in Sanshu province, made inquiries to the authorities, learned about various matters, and returned.
Regarding these people:
One: On the night of April 11th, they viewed the advance notice from Iida lodging and returned. Notably, within this notice there were words about postponement due to rainy weather.
One: Regarding the aforementioned surveying office matters
Ichirōbei Kinzaemon was appointed as the official in charge for the domain territory. He was ordered to go to Iida lodging to make inquiries, return immediately, and go out to meet at the Miyata border. Additionally, he was ordered to bring along people to inquire about handling procedures at Iida. Accordingly, bringing along two people - Jūbei from Shimizu-cho and Gisōta from Sagari-machi - Ichirōbei Kinzaemon departed early morning on the 11th and went to Iida.
However, although there was rain for three days between Asuke and Iida, without any delay they arrived at Iida on the 11th as stated in the official notice.
Consequently, the two people made rounds to three lodgings, made inquiries, and confirmed the details of being appointed as officials in charge of domain territory.

Respectfully submitted,
I unexpectedly received the appointment as commercial license inspector, which I considered a most grateful honor, and have been diligently serving in this capacity. However, I recently fell ill and my condition has gradually worsened to the point where I find it difficult to continue my duties. Therefore, I humbly request to be relieved of this position.

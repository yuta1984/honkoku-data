Humbly submitting this petition with utmost respect:

Regarding the matter of my son Mataemon's common-law relationship with "Teū," the second daughter of Hirasawa Chōuemon from the Machiwari district of Miyata Village. As they are in a common-law marriage, I wish to formally take her as his wife and make her the official wife of my son Mataemon.
I humbly submit this petition regarding this matter.

Concerning the above matter, if you would graciously grant approval as petitioned through your benevolence, it would be most gratefully received. Respectfully submitted.

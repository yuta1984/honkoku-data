One　Last night a courier arrived from Tokyo, and today
　　with everyone in attendance, Acting Senior Councilor Naitō issued
　　the following directive, and also read aloud a personal letter, which we all respectfully
　　listened to with reverence.
　　　His Excellency the Governor was dismissed
　　　on the 14th of this month.

　　　　　Imperial Edict
　　We consider that at this time of renewal, if We wish to
　　protect and secure Our hundreds of millions of subjects internally and to confront
　　all nations externally, it is proper that name and reality should correspond and that government orders
　　should be unified. We previously accepted the return of domain registers
　　by the various domains and newly appointed
　　domain governors to carry out those duties. However, after several hundred years of
　　long-established customs, there are cases where the name exists but the reality
　　is not achieved. How then can We protect and secure Our hundreds of millions of subjects
　　and confront all nations?
　　We deeply lament this situation. Therefore, We now abolish the domains
　　and establish prefectures in their place. This is to eliminate redundancy and
　　adopt simplicity, to remove the evils of having名 without substance,
　　and to eliminate concerns about divergent government orders.

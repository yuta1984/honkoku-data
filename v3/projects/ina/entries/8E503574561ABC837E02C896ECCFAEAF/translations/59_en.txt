8th month (small month)

2nd day
One: Regarding the dispute over Nabekura Suzuriyama, which is common land (iriai) between Ueshima Village and Watado Village, discussions have been arranged as follows for resolution:
　Nabekura Suzuriyama approximately 100 ken in area, Horiguchi
　　Breakdown:
　　　One-fifth　　　Location of the first quarry site
　　　　20 ken　　　　Ueshima Village Kinshirō
　　　　　　　　　　　Watado Village Monuemon
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　widow
　　　Four-fifths
　　　　80 ken　　　　Ueshima and Watado villages collectively
　If no stone can be quarried from the first quarry site,
　they may move to the next location. In that case, since the area would be reduced,
　the one-fifth share should be proportionally decreased. For example,
　if it becomes 90 ken, the one-fifth portion would be 18 ken,
　and four-fifths would be 72 ken. For this land allocation,
　I have informed the bureau chief that a clerk will be dispatched soon.

5th day
One: For the aforementioned land allocation, clerk Matsuzawa Ritōta was
　dispatched today.

7th day
One: The aforementioned person completed the land allocation and returned today.

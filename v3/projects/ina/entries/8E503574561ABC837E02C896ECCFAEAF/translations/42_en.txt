Even in trivial matters, when handled by junior officials in charge of civil administration, with summons and consultations taking several days, no clear prospects emerge, matters become tangled and difficult to resolve. Moreover, regarding provisions for those arrested on suspicious grounds and given detailed explanations after investigation, as well as those summoned for consultation who remain stubborn or do not readily comply, mediators may be appointed, or they may be shackled and placed under custody at lodgings. Recently, for those who have first had their settlement petitions approved and processed, those still under consultation should be informed in advance. However, according to what I have heard, this might become careless handling - this is not the case. His Excellency the Governor is also currently in the capital, and since civil administration is particularly the foundation of domain governance, out of great concern, reforms were implemented last December. However, all matters do not follow old customs, but rather conform to the regulations displayed by the domain office. Though the system is not yet fully established, for now we wish to adhere to these standards. The hope is that communication between superiors and subordinates will flow smoothly in all matters. Of course, this extends to junior clerks and others as well.

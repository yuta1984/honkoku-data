It is just right. Regarding clothing depending on the circumstances of our return, I sent word in the letter of the 6th, but today nothing is clear. By around the 6th, perhaps we will understand the situation a little? Though I said to prepare lined garments and such, they are quite expensive and cannot be made. Therefore, to send what is available - this matter I shall convey in next month's letter of the 6th. However, should we remove the cotton padding? I apologize for these repeated letters.

Item 1: The officials in charge this time are as follows:
　　　　　　　　　　Katsuma Village　　Mr. Karasawa Jūhachi
　　　　　　　　　　Taue Village　　Mr. Hirasawa Sueji  
　　　　　　　　　　Hikage Village　　Mr. Matsushita Magoroku
　　　　　　　　　　Yamada Village　　Mr. Kaneko Keihachi

In addition, Mr. Terada Katsuya is on duty, and Mr. Sawa Rizaemon as well. These two are on duty - which of the above four will be returning? If they come to visit, we would like to express our gratitude. The other day I only reported that the above had arrived safely. During our absence, please be careful about fire hazards and other matters. Please tell mother not to worry. I will write again.

Item 1: Regarding the travel expenses that Genemon sent to that inn, Mr. Hirasawa forgot to collect them, remembered after two or three nights, and collected them at Yose-juku. Please inform Mr. Nakamura of this matter accordingly. I will provide the details when I return home.

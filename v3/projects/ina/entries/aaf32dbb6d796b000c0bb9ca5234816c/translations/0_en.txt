Among the officials in charge, tomorrow the 28th you will depart and return to your domain, so I am writing to report. The weather has become warm, and I trust you are in increasingly good health. Since our departure, we have been in good health on the journey, and on the 24th at around 4 PM (seven o'clock by the old system), we arrived safely at the upper residence in Ogawa-machi. Please be assured of our safety. At the long house within the residence compound, Mr. Seba Mimizo is present, so we two are lodging together there. Everything is quite inconvenient. For meals, we have requested the kitchen to provide all three daily meals delivered from there. From the night of our arrival, we have been paying our respects to the officials on duty.

Item 1: From after 2 PM on the 25th, we requested permission and went to Kyōbashi Gorobeimachi, where we met with Chōbei and others individually. They were truly surprised and greatly delighted. We stayed there one night, and on the following 26th, accompanied by Tetsutarō, we prepared gifts for the officials and returned to the residence.

Item 1: On the same day before noon, we went at the instruction of Ōgiya Kichiuemon and heard about this current matter. Negotiations are to begin on the coming 29th. As of evening, nothing has yet been settled.

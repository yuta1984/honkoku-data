A pledge document submitted

Item: Regarding the stone cutters of our village, we have investigated all throughout the village without exception and submitted this report. There is no one else besides these. Moreover, when going out to work as stone cutters, they shall not take on stone cutting apprentices at their travel destinations. Furthermore, we have instructed them in detail to thoroughly investigate the actual conditions of their business locations, and they have understood and accepted each point. If there should be any negligent matters beyond this that come to your attention later, please promptly report from your end (Heizo-sama). Even if any form of punishment should be imposed thereafter, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. For future reference, a jointly signed pledge document, thus as stated.

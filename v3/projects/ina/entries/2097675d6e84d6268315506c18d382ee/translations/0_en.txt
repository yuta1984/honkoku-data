Respectfully submitted as a written petition

On this occasion,
His Lordship traveled to Kyoto and successfully
completed his business there,
returning home safely, which fills us with the utmost joy and gratitude. In light of this,
the individuals whose names are listed on the separate document wish, though it be but a small token,
to present an imported timepiece
as a congratulatory offering, expressing our profound joy. Regarding this matter,
if you would graciously grant your approval, we would consider it
a most grateful blessing.

Kansei 4th year (Year of the Rat)
November 15th

1. Today there was no monthly formal greeting ceremony
Since there was a celebration for the young lord's iro-naoshi (coming-of-age ceremony), I wore formal silk and hemp half-court dress and departed home at 5:30 AM (9:00 AM) to go to the castle.

1. Those who were absent today appeared, so I explained to my colleagues. The details are as follows:
　　Accumulated qi illness　　　Lord Manabe Wakasa
　　Hernia and accumulated qi　　Lord Doi Noto

1. After the senior councillors assembled, there were audiences at each seat as per the usual general attendance
For the same rank, we sat in the Gan-no-ma (Wild Goose Room) coming out from the upper part of the narrow corridor
I, in the upper seat, stated that I would offer congratulations for the iro-naoshi ceremony
Lord Etchū-no-kami in the upper seat said it was auspicious, and at that time remaining silent
It concluded appropriately, and then I temporarily waited in the monk's quarters
The senior inspector Kuwahara Yoshū told me to remain after the audience before meeting the senior councillors was completed, and showed me the official document. This was because
Today's duty day circular was issued jointly in my name and Lord Suō's name
From Lord Suō. Moreover, soup and sake were bestowed
And there was an official document for making rounds.

1. There was a summons from the inspector, so I went to the Gan-no-ma
As per receiving the ceremonial bird, colleagues and ceremony announcers faced each other
The heir of the main seat in the Kiku-no-ma (Chrysanthemum Room) sat next to colleagues, while those of the same place in subordinate positions sat
Next to the ceremony announcers, soup was served, and two types of side dishes were served with the meal
Clay vessels were also provided, sake was served twice around
The senior councillors came out to give greetings. At that time, Lord Etchū-no-kami in the upper seat
Said to partake leisurely, and Lord Dewa in the upper seat among colleagues expressed gratitude
The senior councillors went inside, sake was served once more, and the meal with sake server was
Also removed. No formal thanks were given to the guard captains, and as on January 11th
The senior councillors sat in the Fuyō-no-ma (Lotus Room), attendants came out to give thanks, then
The hereditary retainers came out and finished, and in replacement three senior colleagues
Also on the ceremony announcer side, the duty officer, then two others in order of rank, three in total
We also followed after the ceremony announcers, with the heir of the main seat in the Kiku-no-ma, those in subordinate positions in the same place
And the same heir all coming out, and Lord Dewa in the upper seat received soup and
Sake and expressed gratitude, which concluded the ceremony. Moreover, in the Fuyō
-no-ma, toward the narrow corridor, Lord Etchū-no-kami was seated in the upper position, so
On the opposite side, Lord Dewa in the upper seat among colleagues, then those in subordinate positions in the same place
Became the lower seats. The diagram is as follows:

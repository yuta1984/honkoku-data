Today, for the celebration of the young lord's first hair ceremony (omiokioki), I wore formal court dress (noshime long hakama) and arrived at the castle at the appointed time. I presented myself at the Kari-no-ma (Wild Goose Room) and after completing the customary rounds, I was bestowed with seasonal clothing (jifuku) by Sanada Ukyo-no-taifu and Matsudaira Saemon-no-suke at the Fuyo-no-ma (Hibiscus Room). Following protocol, I withdrew to the Kiku-no-ma (Chrysanthemum Room). Shortly after, the inspector (metsuke) summoned me back to the Kari-no-ma, where Sanada Ukyo-no-taifu and Matsudaira Saemon-no-suke took their seats after a brief interval. The duty ceremonial attendants (sōshaban) and magistrates of temples and shrines (jisha-bugyō) were seated across from them. After receiving the ceremonial rice cakes for the celebration, we were served sake and soup, with two cups of sake each. Lord Toda Uneme-no-shō then appeared, offered greetings, and after his departure, we received another cup of sake, concluding that portion. After a brief interval, the inspector again summoned us to the Kari-no-ma, where the high-ranking family duty officers, two duty attendants, the duty ceremonial attendant, and the magistrate of temples and shrines sat together. The senior councillors (rōjū) took their positions in the Fuyo-no-ma, and Sanada Ukyo-no-taifu and Matsudaira Saemon-no-suke came forward to express gratitude for receiving the celebratory gifts. Subsequently, all those seated in the Kari-no-ma came forward together to offer their respects, and after all matters were concluded, we withdrew.

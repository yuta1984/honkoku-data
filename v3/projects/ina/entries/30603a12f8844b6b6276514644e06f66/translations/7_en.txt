Humbly submitted in writing:
The conditions within our town district have been continuously declining and impoverished for many years now. While we continue to fulfill our post-horse duties and various other official obligations, the recent particularly poor economic conditions have resulted in many vacant houses. Regarding rent matters, there are numerous cases where we can only manage with the wages from post-horse duties alone, creating extreme hardship.

Therefore, regarding the matter of becoming a wholesale dealer for various goods, if you would graciously grant this privilege limited to within our town district, it would contribute to the prosperity and support of our district, our commercial activities would flourish, and it would be a most grateful arrangement for all residents. Regarding the official tribute, we intend to make payment to the authorities as instructed. For the cargo wholesale business, Yorozuya Shōzō and Izumiya Genjirō wish to undertake this responsibility.

The above is respectfully submitted.

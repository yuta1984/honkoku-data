Respectfully submitting this written petition

I humbly submitted a petition to Nagasaka Village this spring, and I am grateful that it was approved as requested. Since I previously worked as a traveling stone cutter, I would like to go out again this year to work as a traveling stone cutter. Therefore, I respectfully request that my name be entered in the stone cutter registry. I humbly request your merciful consideration of this petition, and if granted as requested, I would be most grateful. The above.

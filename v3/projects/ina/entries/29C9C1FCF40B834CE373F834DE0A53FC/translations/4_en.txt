　　Copy of a letter dated the fourth day of the eighth month, second year of Genbun (Hinoto-Mi year), from Miyoshi Manemon to Yamanaka Moriemon, a retainer of Takashima Domain in Suwa District
　　The beginning of the text is cut off and unclear
　　In the lord's living quarters, he diligently performed his official duties well, and after expressing gratitude for the bestowal of gifts out of kindness and withdrawing, he had concerns about the matter of these bestowed gifts.

　　When he communicated this through the Senior Inspector, he was told that the matter had been reported to the chief retainers. Although he felt this was an unresolved matter, he dealt with it accordingly. Although his expression of concerns was strongly worded, he had properly reported his gratitude for the gifts given out of kindness to the chief retainers as well. Had it not been for this matter, he would have worn the bestowed summer kimono for the Hassaku festival, but he did not wear it. Apart from this matter, there were absolutely no issues with his official duties, but on the fourth day he was given the following notice:
　　　Regarding you: By special consideration, you are granted permanent leave
　　　You shall not engage in any form of samurai service
　　　Kyoto, Osaka, Edo, Shinano Province
　　　You are prohibited from traveling to the above places
　　This being the case, I shall immediately withdraw and depart.

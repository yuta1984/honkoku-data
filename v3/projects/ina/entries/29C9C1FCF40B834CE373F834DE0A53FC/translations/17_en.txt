Shinuemon served in concurrent roles. His second son Chikatatsu died in battle at Osaka in Settsu Province on the 7th day of the 5th month of Genna 1st year. At this time, he died in battle together with flag magistrate Shiba Taibei, and Nai Sadayu was also one of those who died in battle. Afterwards, Shinuemon became ill and could not walk, so when he petitioned for exemption from his duties, Lord Tsūgi said "Then serve by palanquin" and granted him a palanquin to continue his service. Years passed and he transferred his position to his heir Kichibei. In his later years, Shinuemon retired under the name Jōtsubaki and received a stipend for sake allowance. In the 8th month of Kan'ei 13th year (year of the rat), he moved to Mogami in Dewa Province as an attendant. In the 20th year of the same era, he moved as an attendant to Wakamatsu Castle in Aizu, Ōshū. On the 11th day of the 1st month of the 21st year, he died of illness, and his remains were buried at Kenpuku-ji Temple on Mt. Daihō in Aoki Village at the same location. His Buddhist name was Juzan Jōtsubaki Koji.

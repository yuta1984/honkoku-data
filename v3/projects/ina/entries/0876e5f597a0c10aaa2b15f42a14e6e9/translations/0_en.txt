Document of Perpetual Transfer of Sake Brewing License

Item: Regarding the matter of perpetually transferring one sake brewing license for 900 koku of sake brewing rice that we possess, this is hereby made clear. As payment for this, we have just now certainly received twenty-five ryō in gold, which is true and accurate. Concerning the aforementioned sake brewing license, not only do relatives and family members raise no objections, but no third parties have any objections whatsoever. Should anyone from anywhere raise any improper claims, the co-signatories will take responsibility and certainly resolve the matter, ensuring that you will not be caused even the slightest trouble or hardship. Even if any difficulties should arise hereafter, we will not violate this agreement in the least. This joint-signature document serves as proof for posterity. Therefore, as stated above.

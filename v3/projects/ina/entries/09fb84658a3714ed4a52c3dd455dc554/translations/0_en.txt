Document of Declaration Submitted

Item: Regarding the stone cutters of our village, we have thoroughly investigated without exception, and there is not even one person other than those listed in this year's registry. Furthermore, when we instructed them to avoid any misunderstandings, they humbly acknowledged our instructions. Should you later hear of any others we have concealed beyond these, please report to the authorities. Even if we should receive any punishment for this matter, we will harbor no resentment. This document is for future reference.

　　　Formal Request
One: This time, due to my financial difficulties, I have become unable to make ends meet and cannot raise this child, so I am leaving the child with your household. This is absolutely not a child of lowly birth, so please accept and raise the child without concern. I humbly request this of you. This child was born on the ninth day of the fourth month of Kaei 3, Year of the Dog, so please, as stated above, I beseech you with your compassion. That is all.

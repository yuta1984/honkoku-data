[his daughter] was sent as wife to Yoichi - the petition was approved.
- On the 14th day of the 12th month of the same year, he died of illness. Since he had adopted sons two or three times, only gratitude was expressed.
- On the 28th day of the 2nd month of Hōreki 12 (1762), Year of the Horse, he had died in the previous December. Having no biological sons, he should have petitioned for an adopted son beforehand, but since he had made such petitions repeatedly midway through the process, he refrained from making the petition out of deference. Since there were various circumstances each time, it was reasonable that he did not make the petition. The matter of his petition made at the time of his death was conveyed through proper channels and heard. Although petitions for adoption made while lamenting and holding back would normally not be accepted, since Kuzaemon had diligently performed his official duties for many years with sincere service, by special compassion his family name would be reestablished. A suitable person capable of current service should be selected and petitioned for. This was conveyed to his widow and relatives, or if there were no relatives, to those of equal rank who were close to the family.

- On the 28th day of the 1st month of Hōreki 11 (1761), Year of the Snake, he died of illness.

- On the 3rd day of the 8th month of Hōreki 12 (1762), Year of the Horse, it was announced that the widow's petition for family succession should be accepted as requested.
- On the 4th day of the same month, since Koike Kuzaemon had served diligently without negligence in his official duties for many years, it was announced that his family name should be reestablished. The petition was accepted as requested, he was granted 5 koku with provisions for two people, and temporarily placed under the supervision of the chief inspector.
- On the 24th day of the same month, he absconded. His adoptive mother remained behind.
- On the 28th day, by mercy his adoptive mother was to be handed over to relatives, so she was ordered to vacate the residence immediately.

The household goods belonging to the mother were handed over, while Unpei's belongings became confiscated property.

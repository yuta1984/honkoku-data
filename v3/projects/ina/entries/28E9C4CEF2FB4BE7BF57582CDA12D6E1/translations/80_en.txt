- On the 11th day of the 4th month of An'ei 3 (1774), Year of the Horse, due to his father Kyūzaemon's old age, he retired as requested and inherited the family headship with a stipend of 18 hyō and provisions for two people. His duties remained as before.

- On the 7th day of the 11th month of An'ei 7 (1778), Year of the Dog, having previously made improper statements, he refused to consult with Kochi Genemon and Ōhira Kohei, created difficulties regarding both men's official duties, forcing them to report the matter through proper channels. Given the current circumstances, this was not limited to him alone but affected everyone. Since he had petitioned with poor judgment, there was no choice but to return the matter for investigation, and he was ordered to submit a petition at his discretion. However, his negligent conduct showed he took important petition matters lightly, and he may have made further improper statements. His disrespectful conduct toward superiors was inappropriate and should have warranted investigation, but considering his father Kyūzaemon's decades of faithful service, he was granted permanent dismissal. He was forbidden from serving elsewhere, prohibited from approaching not only the domain territory but also both Edo residences, and departed immediately without returning home.

Article 1: Regarding the portion of the storehouse that extends into the town row due to official orders,
　it shall be left as is, and repairs may be carried out freely
　provided notice is given to the Shinmachi town representative. However, regarding the
　land where the aforementioned storehouse extends, since it is public road land of Shinmachi, in future years
　when constructing houses according to the convenience of the said residential plot,
　the construction must be done with the land pulled back in line with the town row.
　　Provided that as long as it remains a storehouse for any number of years,
　　the performance of town row duties such as corvée labor shall continue as before,
　　and no additional burden shall be imposed
　　on the portion of land extending into the town row.

Article 1: For the freedom of the land where two storehouses
　exist on the portion of land extending into the Shinmachi public road, five ryō as consideration money to Ariga

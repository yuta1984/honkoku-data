Respectfully submitted as a written petition

The succession of Nakamachi cloth merchant Ichiemon has been temporarily interrupted. As there is now a marriage prospect for my younger brother Manbei, I have privately discussed sending him as an adoptive heir to continue the succession. Therefore, I humbly submit this petition.

Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously grant this petition as requested in your mercy, it would be a most grateful circumstance. Above stated.

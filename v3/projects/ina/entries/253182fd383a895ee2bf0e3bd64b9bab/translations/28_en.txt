Respectfully submitting this oral petition regarding the following matter:

Our neighborhood consists of twenty-eight households, but the population has gradually decreased and many houses have become vacant, making the town duties burdensome and causing great hardship for everyone. Therefore, we have agreed among ourselves that even for properties that have become vacant, the landlords should perform the nightly watch duties for each lot, and for properties used as storehouses and such, both night watch duties and various other civic obligations should be fulfilled. This has been decided within our neighborhood limits, and everyone understands this arrangement.

However, regarding the rental property owned by Kiso Heijūrō, located in the middle of the west side of our neighborhood, with a frontage of three ken, one shaku, and five sun, and a depth of ten ken and one shaku, plus an additional

passage (oshinuke) of three ken and four ken of adjoining land extending to Shinmachi, for twenty-five or twenty-six years previously, even when tenants changed successively, they performed civic duties like everyone else.

After it became vacant, we informed the aforementioned Heijūrō that according to our neighborhood agreement, he should fulfill the town duties, but he would not comply. We repeatedly gave him advice and counsel, but he absolutely refuses to understand. Therefore, we had no choice but to petition the town officials, and although they provided guidance to Heijūrō, he apparently said he would pay a small amount of money (chōmoku) annually, but this does not correspond to our neighborhood agreement at all.

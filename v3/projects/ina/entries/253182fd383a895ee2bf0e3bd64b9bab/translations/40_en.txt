To Inokuchi Sadaroku-sama

Regarding the above petition, at the government office on the 13th being the first day of official business, it was submitted through an intermediary, and it was immediately handed over, so I returned and delivered it to the wholesale merchant.

Humbly, I petition through this oral statement:
I am an incompetent person, but having been appointed to the position of chō-dai (town representative), I considered it a grateful fortune and have been serving in this role. However, due to financial difficulties, I find it difficult to continue serving in this official position. Therefore, I humbly request to be pardoned from this duty.

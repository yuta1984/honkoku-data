The above petition was submitted with the final signature and seal on the same 10th day through Mr. Isawa's intermediation at the government office. It was immediately approved, so I returned home and called the town representative Tazaemon to inform him.

Humbly submitting this oral petition:
Item: 300 pack-horse loads of pine lumber
This lumber will be purchased from sawyers, and from this Dog year through the coming Rat year, over a period of three years, we wish to sell and transport it to your domain and neighboring domains.

For this purpose, we humbly request that you allow us to pass through the inspection stations at Hokoji without delay.

Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously grant our petition as requested, it would be most grateful and fortunate for us. The above.

After submitting through Inokuchi's mediation, on the 25th of the same month, we received the endorsed document through Izawa's mediation and it was delivered. Therefore, we called Kichiuemon, the town representative of Nakamachi, and handed it over to him. However, there were strict instructions that selling any small timber to Suwa was not permitted, so we strictly ordered that under no circumstances should anything be sold in the Suwa area.

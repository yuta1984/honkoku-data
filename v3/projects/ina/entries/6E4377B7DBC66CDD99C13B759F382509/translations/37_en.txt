{{Note: calmed the townspeople and welcomed him in, summoning his kinsmen and retainers to discuss methods for a night attack. Here Mizutani Saburōbee-no-jō stepped forward from the far end of the seating and said "A humble opinion from the lowest seat, I humbly beg your pardon," but continued: "Having already joined this council, it would be meaningless not to speak my mind. I have heard that when a desperate bird enters one's breast, even the hunter will not kill it. For such a great daimyō as Masamune to have already abandoned years of resentment and come relying on you, only to treacherously attack him in darkness - this is not what brave warriors should do. This is especially true for training in the martial arts. Moreover, to leave our castle and reach the border of his domain at Koma-ga-mine is a journey of merely three ri, and today has not yet reached the hour of the Sheep. If we intended to let Masamune enter his territory, he could arrive before evening. That he remains here with such a small force - how could this not involve deep strategy? Better that we prepare our defenses, guard the night in his stead, first let him return to his home province this time, and when he again desires battle, let us fight honorably and leave victory or defeat to the heavenly fortune of both houses." All those present agreed with this opinion, and they placed provisions from food to fish, salt, tea, and sweets near those lodgings, lit watch fires on all four sides when night fell, and had soldiers patrol through the night with utmost vigilance. Yoshitane's samurai, seeing Masamune's overly composed demeanor, thought "Let us test his mettle" and after midnight cut loose one or two horses. The common soldiers ran about in great commotion. Masamune had a page carry a candle, wore white kosode with an outer robe, carried a sword at his left side and came out saying "Are any of Lord Sōma's}}

{{Note: men present?" When someone replied "Yes, here," he said "Things are noisy. What is happening?" "Masamune's men are causing a disturbance. Please quiet them well," and he went back inside. Thus dawn broke but he did not depart, and around the hour of the Snake he sent a messenger to Yoshitane with formal greetings and quietly rode away. When they secretly sent someone to observe, they saw Date forces like clouds and mist filling the roads beyond Koma-ga-mine in his domain, coming out to meet him. Thus the Battle of Sekigahara ended, the entire realm was pacified, and Sōma's domain was already confiscated and the house was on the verge of destruction. Masamune appealed to Lord Tokugawa: "Sōma has long been Masamune's enemy. However, their alliance with Uesugi, Ishida and others was certain, and when the time came that Masamune should be killed by them, hearing that I was riding down on your orders, they immediately forgot old grudges and received new favor. Was this not entirely because they harbored no treacherous intentions? Moreover, for a house of generations of warriors to face eternal extinction at this time is truly the height of pity. If it please you, I beg your permission for the restoration of their original domain." He repeatedly lamented this on various occasions, so after some years passed, they were granted their original domain. From this time, at the beginning of yearly councils in that house, each person in the assembly would approach before the seat of Mizutani's descendants and say "We must not go against Lord Mizutani's wise counsel" before withdrawing. This became an honored custom. Later, Masamune tried to reconcile with Daizen-no-suke Toshitane through the mediation of Ii Kamon-no-kami Naotaka, but when Toshitane heard this: "Our house has already received Date-dono's kind}}

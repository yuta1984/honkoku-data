　　　　Tachibana
Sakon-shōgen Minamoto no Muneshige was a retainer from Chikuzen Province, son of Tachibana Tango-no-kami Akitsura, who took the Buddhist name Dōsetsu. It is said that the Tachibana and Ōtomo clans are both branches of the same Minamoto lineage. Their ancestor Ōtomo Sakon-shōgen Yoshinao was the son of Kammon-no-kami Fujiwara no Chikayoshi (namely, the assistant director of the Saiinshi), but was actually the son of Right General Yoritomo, whose mother was the daughter of Ōtomo Shirō-dayū Tsuneie. Yoshinao first went down to Bungo Province as the Chinzei deputy. His son Tone Jirō Chikahide was appointed to Ōi-no-suke. Chikahide's great-great-grandson Sakon-shōgen Sadamune had two sons: the elder was Sakon-shōgen Sadanori and the younger was Shikibu-no-jō Ujiyasu. From this point the two houses separated, and Sadanori's lineage went to Chikuzen Province

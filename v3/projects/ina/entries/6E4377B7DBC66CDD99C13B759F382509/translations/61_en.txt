This was so shocking that it was debated whether Naotoki should be summoned, but perhaps there was something that had already come to the lord's attention, for that is exactly what happened.

Soon after, Naonori again died suddenly without illness, leading to talk about the transience of worldly affairs (unfounded claims were also made; the details are unknown). Since Naonori had no adopted heir, his domain was confiscated by the government. On the 21st day of the 6th month of the same year, Oki-no-kami Naotoki was summoned and told: "It would be most pitiful for your ancestral house to be extinguished.

Naotoki also died not long after, on the 27th day of the 7th month of the following 5th year, and his son Tonomo-no-kami Naotomo succeeded his father.

This was the beginning of his distinguished service, and after displaying martial valor on many occasions, in the spring of Tenshō 12, Lord Kitabatake

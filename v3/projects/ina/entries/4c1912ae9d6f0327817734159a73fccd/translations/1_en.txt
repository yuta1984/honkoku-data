Written pledge submitted

Item: There is not a single person engaged in stone-cutting migrant work.
Regarding the above matter, we have carefully investigated each household in the village and found no discrepancies whatsoever. Should there be any matters we failed to investigate properly that come to your attention later, please report them immediately from your end. Whatever punishment may be imposed upon us thereafter, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. This pledge is written as a precaution, hence as stated.

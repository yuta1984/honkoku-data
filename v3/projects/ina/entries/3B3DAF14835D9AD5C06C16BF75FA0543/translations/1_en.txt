Article 2: Regarding official government announcements and matters concerning the castle, even if there are inquiries or questions from unofficial sources, one must not relay even the smallest matters to his lordship's attention.

Those outside these four roles shall not serve as intermediaries. However, even if retainers' vassals, town doctors, farmers, or townspeople request an audience, those outside the aforementioned four roles shall not serve as intermediaries.

The above articles are to be strictly observed hereafter as instructed, and all samurai of the household should take note. The above.

Consult with the construction department to receive the paper mulberry fields, and both officials should take very good care of the planting. Since this has now become the responsibility of the official departments, the contractors should diligently tend to maintenance and other tasks, keeping in mind that increasing profits should be the primary concern as the paper mulberry grows abundantly. During maintenance work, do not hesitate to employ attendants, and focus solely on doubling the paper mulberry production. Discuss this matter with fellow officials, and also instruct subordinates to handle this matter diligently and with proper consideration. Since there were instructions indicating understanding of this matter, I have informed fellow officials about various matters and also communicated this to subordinates.

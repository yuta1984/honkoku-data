Oral Instructions

Regarding footwear for unranked ashigaru (foot soldiers): they should use hiki-geta (plain wooden clogs) and straw sandals in all cases, but some have begun using koma-geta with kata-o (hard thongs) at some point. From now on, they shall use hiki-geta with yatsu-o (eight-strand thongs) and the like.

First, regarding umbrellas, some carry janome (bull's-eye pattern) umbrellas, so they should be careful about this from now on. Also, some wear their hair in high chignons, so they should be careful to keep it appropriate. This should also be communicated. Please ensure these instructions are conveyed to the supervising heads. The above.

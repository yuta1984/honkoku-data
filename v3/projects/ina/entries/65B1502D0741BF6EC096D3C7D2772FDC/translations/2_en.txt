Even within the samurai household, some go out wearing cotton clothing and change into prohibited garments of excessive appearance at their destinations or along the way, or wear white under-kimono when attending funeral processions. This is absolutely outrageous and impious, representing extremely improper conduct toward their superiors. Particularly regarding white under-kimono, even the families of palace attendants are prohibited from wearing such items, so this ultimately appears to be due to the negligence of group leaders in their regular instructions. Each group and each supervisor must conduct strict examinations. From now on, not only in local rounds but even while staying in residence, if we hear that anyone secretly and stealthily violates the established law with inappropriate appearance, we will confiscate such clothing and impose strict punishment. When it comes to that point, it will constitute a transgression by the supervising head. Group supervisors must conduct renewed examinations and strictly enforce the established law.

Regarding indulgence in luxury and participation in drinking and dining gatherings, one must understand one's station and diligently oversee to ensure there is no inappropriate behavior.

The above instructions shall be communicated to all group supervisors. The above.

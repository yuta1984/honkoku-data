Regarding the reconstruction of Gongen-sama's sacred palanquin in the year of Boshin (1648), there was no written record and confusion arose. Through the mediation of three men - Chūzaemon, Ichiuemon, and Gonbei - it was resolved that six shrine priests and six shrine town people would provide laborers jointly, the matter of offering money would be decided for the time being, and if the sacred territory became more important with petitions, only the shrine priests would guard it. However, there had been disputes from before, and this time it became a legal case. Thereupon, Deputy Governor Yoshida Kinuemon, through the mediation of the town elders, ruled that the matter of the palanquin's offering money should follow the shrine priests' wishes entirely, and moreover 600 mon in goods should be paid to the shrine town. Furthermore, regarding palanquin carrying, as previously decided, six people from the shrine town should be provided. This was mediated and resolved. From now on, regardless of what grievances the shrine priests may have, six palanquin carriers must be provided, and moreover the shrine town must accommodate the palanquin's procession throughout. Should the sacred territory naturally become more important as petitioned, since laborers will not be provided, the 600 mon in goods will also not be delivered. Having decided thus, neither party shall cause disturbances. A written pledge for posterity, therefore as stated.

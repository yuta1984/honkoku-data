Through the mediation of Kinuemon-sama and the town elders, it was settled that all mikoshi participation money would go to the shrine priests, but in exchange they would pay 600 mon as compensation to Miyamachi. Regarding mikoshi carriers, as previously decided, Miyamachi would provide six people. This mediation was completed and agreed upon. From now on, regardless of any resentment the shrine priests may harbor, six mikoshi carriers will be provided, and the entire Miyamachi will accompany the mikoshi procession. Should the shrine territories overlap, no laborers will be provided, and therefore the 600 mon compensation will not be given either. Having made these agreements, both parties shall not violate them. This document is provided as proof for the future. The above is correct.

Petition

Regarding the time of the shrine palanquin reconstruction, the town elders came to the spear-bearers and said they would construct a palanquin and requested that about two people be provided. At that time, we stated that "the three shrine priests should guard it, as they have been doing for generations since ancient times." When we pressed this point, the town elders said in various ways that "although it is troublesome for the shrine headquarters, please guard it." However, we firmly stated that "since we have been farmers since ancient times, we cannot fulfill the duties of priests for Gongen-sama." At that time, the shrine priests said, "In that case, if you construct one palanquin for us, we will guard it wearing sashes, so please construct one palanquin." Then Uhyōe-dono, Ichiuemon-dono, and Chūzaemon-dono mediated, saying: "Though presumptuous, we will mediate. Regarding the matter of three palanquins, how would it be with just one? If naturally the sacred territory becomes more important from the government, then only the shrine priests should guard it. If not, half the shrine town and half the priests should guard it. Moreover, the matter of offering money was also settled with mediation for the time being, but now again the priests are saying various things about the offering money being three portions." Now, regarding this further matter of half shrine town people and half priests, we humbly request that the nine bales of rice granted by his lordship be distributed to us as well as to the priests of Ōshima, so that we may conduct the sacred rituals properly.

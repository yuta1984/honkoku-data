Respectfully submitting this verbal petition:

Regarding the mountain forests and temple grounds that Kenpuku-ji has filed a lawsuit about this time: Since this is a temple with ancient historical connections, from the time we received red-sealed documents from Lord Shingen and Lord Katsuyori, and subsequently received written grants generation after generation extending even to Lord Hoshina Higo-no-kami's granted lands, these were granted to us without fail as stated above. Moreover, as a family temple, we were granted a 100-koku estate in Kasagata village adjacent to the said grounds. However, when Lord Higo-no-kami was transferred to another domain and Lord Torii Shuzen-sho received the grant, under the direction of senior retainers Toriyama Izumi-dono and Nagasaka Inaba-dono, they unreasonably ordered that Kenpuku-ji be destroyed and replaced with Minesan-ji as Lord Shuzen-sho's family temple. Although the head priest and parishioners naturally presented documentary evidence of ancient historical rights, this was not accepted. Therefore, the head priest, being greatly troubled, went down to Edo and filed a lawsuit. As a result, without fail as stated above, from the year of the Rat to the year of the Tiger, there was no interference and we administered the mountain forests and temple grounds as before. However, in the third year, the aforementioned Izumi-dono and Inaba-dono confiscated the mountain forests and temple grounds. Since both the head priest and parishioners said that under such circumstances the temple would collapse, we filed various lawsuits requesting restoration as before, but this was not granted and ultimately nothing was returned to us, causing us great distress.

However, in the third year, the aforementioned Izumi-dono and Inaba-dono confiscated the mountain forests and temple grounds. Since both the head priest and parishioners said that under such circumstances the temple would collapse, we filed various lawsuits requesting restoration as before, but this was not granted and ultimately nothing was returned to us, causing us great distress.

As indisputable evidence, we have several red-sealed documents. Furthermore, since the Three Shrines Great Gongen of Hokoji has borrowed and resided on Kenpuku-ji's mountain, they have made annual payments to the temple as thanks, and in ancient times礼銭 was also paid. Now, we believe this to be the proper time for our lawsuit. As Kenpuku-ji is increasingly approaching ruin, we humbly beseech your mercy to hear and understand the above circumstances and restore the mountain forests and temple grounds to us as in ancient times. We earnestly implore your compassion.

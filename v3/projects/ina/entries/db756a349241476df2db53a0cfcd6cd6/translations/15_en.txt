Humbly respectfully,
I have a connection to Denbei's household in Hokomotemachi, but Denbei has grown old
and frail and has no male heir to inherit his family name, so I together with my wife and son Jirōhachi
and daughter Ichi would like to be taken in to inherit Denbei's family name, which we have discussed privately. Therefore I petition for this.
Regarding the above matter, through your benevolence

Humbly respectfully,
My adopted daughter Rumi, whom I petitioned for in Kyōwa 1, Year of the Rooster, and married to
Lord Nakamura Katsuzō under the jurisdiction of the Construction Office,
has now been divorced by mutual agreement and I have taken her back into my household. Furthermore, his daughter Sue has an informal engagement,
so I would like to take her into my household as a dependent. Therefore I petition for this.

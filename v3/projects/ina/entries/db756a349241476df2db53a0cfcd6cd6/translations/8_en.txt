Humbly submitted
1. Regarding my son Kenzaburo, in the previous year of the sheep I petitioned and sent him to work as a shop apprentice at Kitahara Takichi's store in Yokkaichi-machi, Kofu. However, as Takichi's store closed last year, I now wish to send him to work as a shop apprentice at Murataya Uhei's establishment in Kanda Kishimachi, Edo. Therefore, I petition that his religious registration seal be made invalid during his period of service.

Humbly petitioning in writing
1. I have served as a water official and worked as a blacksmith until now, but as I have aged, I find it difficult to carry out my duties. Therefore, I petition to be pardoned from my water official duties. If you would graciously grant my petition as requested through your mercy, it would be most grateful and fortunate.

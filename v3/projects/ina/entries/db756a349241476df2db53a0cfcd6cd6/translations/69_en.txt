Respectfully submitting this written petition

I have until now served in the capacity of御水相勤 (water-related duties) as a disciple of Hirasawa Denshige (previously called Shōsuke, working as a blacksmith), but having completed my term of service and received proper dismissal, I now change my name to Ichibei. Furthermore, I wish to continue serving in the御水相勤 position. I humbly request that you graciously grant my petition, which would be a most grateful blessing.

I wish to take a person named Toyokichi from Kamiooshima Village as my adopted apprentice, have him serve in water duties (御水役), and train him in blacksmithing. I humbly request that you graciously grant the water permit (御水札) as petitioned, which would be a most grateful blessing.

Humbly submitted petition in oral statement form:
My husband Chōzaemon developed wind disease in the past year of Bunka 12, year of the Boar, and
became mentally disturbed. We tried various treatments and prayers, but it was an extremely difficult illness
and he did not recover. Therefore, he could not conduct the sake brewing business, and especially since the onset of illness
there were considerable expenses. Moreover, there were borrowed rice payments from the government, other private loans,
and many burdens including an elderly mother, the sick person, and young children of that year,
making it impossible to maintain our livelihood. Being deeply distressed, I consulted with relatives and
sold even household goods and miscellaneous tools. At that time, Kurokawachi Jinuemon-sama,
who is related as my father's cousin's connection, and furthermore since my younger brother Chūzaemon
has been serving at his place,
provided generous assistance in all matters. Through this,
we collected thirty ryō from the proceeds of sold items, and when I spoke about first wanting to pay
the government rice debt, he said that regarding the rice debt, there would also be
sake payment loans, so we should collect and pay them. As for this money,
he kindly suggested that he would keep it and earn interest, so that in the future my son Kamezaburō could use it as trading capital
and for caring for the elderly mother and the sick person,
and he took it in custody. Later, relatives showed compassion and collected money from outstanding debts,
and when another seventeen ryō or so was accumulated, he said it would not be proper
to leave this in a woman's hands, and since it would also earn interest, he should keep it as well.
Additionally, converting money collected in coins to gold, and collecting mujin funds
and other sources, from Bunka 13, year of the Rat to the year of the Tiger, about sixty ryō
was entrusted to him. When I spoke about wanting to settle private debts from this amount,
he said that payment could be made at any time, so first we should collect as much as possible

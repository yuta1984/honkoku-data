Respectfully submitted as a written petition

Item: There is an informal engagement with one called Genbei, son of Shōzaemon of Mikkacho in Minowa domain under Lord Matsudaira Tamba no Kami's territory. I wish to take him as an adopted son and have him marry my daughter Iyo to continue the family succession. I have discussed this matter internally and therefore humbly petition.

I would be most grateful if you would graciously grant my petition as requested. That is all.

Document respectfully submitted

Item: Regarding this autumn's religious sect re-inspection, as there are many official duties, we have been ordered to conduct the population census ourselves this year, which we humbly acknowledge. When examined in the presence of town representatives and group leaders, the religious affiliations and population records are exactly the same as during the spring inspection, with no discrepancies whatsoever.

Item: Regarding population increases and decreases, we submit a separate ledger.

As stated above, we have carefully inspected the entire town and found nothing suspicious whatsoever. Should any improper matters come to your attention, we accept any punishment that may be imposed, and submit this jointly signed document for future reference.

Therefore, as written

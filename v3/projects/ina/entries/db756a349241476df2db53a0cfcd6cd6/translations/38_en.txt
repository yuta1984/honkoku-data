Humbly, I submit this oral petition
One: I have become ill in recent years and find it difficult to continue making a living, suffering hardship in my daily life. Therefore, I wish to transfer the family name to my son Chōtarō, and I myself would like to go and live as a dependent with my relative Yozaburō in Kamiho-juku under the jurisdiction of Lord Kondō Kawachi-no-kami. Regarding this matter, I request that you nullify my religious sect seal. With your compassion, if you would grant this petition as requested, it would be most grateful. End　　　　Hoko-machi district

Humbly, I submit this oral petition
One: Regarding Uedaya Kanzaburō, in the previous year of the Dog, I petitioned to send him as an indentured servant for a ten-year term to Murataya Uhei in Kanda Kishi-machi, Edo. As there are family connections with that household, I have now discussed internally about sending him as an adopted son. Therefore, I submit this petition.
With your compassion, if you would grant this petition as requested, it would be most grateful. End　[Village name crossed out] <<Interlinear: Hokomo-mura | Kataha-mura [Village crossed out - editorial note here]>>

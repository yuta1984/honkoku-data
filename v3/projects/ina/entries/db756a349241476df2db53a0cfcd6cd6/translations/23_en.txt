　　I humbly submit this oral petition
One　Uedaya Taibei has died, leaving only daughters
　　who cannot care for their mother, so until a successor is established
　　the same person's mother has connections to Kizaemon's family in Kinoshita village,
　　which is under the jurisdiction of Matsudaira Tamba-no-kami-sama, so she will temporarily be under their care

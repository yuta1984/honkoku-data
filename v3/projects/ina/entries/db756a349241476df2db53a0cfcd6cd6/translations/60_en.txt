This caused extreme hardship, and while during the Years of the Horse and Sheep one ryō each was paid as interest, from the Year of the Monkey onwards nothing was paid at all, making it impossible to make ends meet.
Regarding this money matter, since Chōzaemon was ill and did not consult with his sister-in-law or brothers, leaving everything to Rōsen-sama's consideration, we cannot understand such proceedings. Now facing destitution and having no excuse to offer to relatives, our position has become untenable, so we petition that through your compassion you investigate and order definite repayment. The opposing party responds as follows:

Regarding those forty ryō, we received sake sales proceeds totaling fifty-four ryō by year's end, and by the end of the Year of the Ox agreed on interest at fifteen percent. However, claiming unpaid rice fees and forcibly collecting payments, and since private loan accounting was also inadequate, to avoid public embarrassment, after consulting with elder brother Buuemon and younger brother Chūzaemon, they insisted on relying on us. While high-interest loans were difficult to accept, we said that if it were at twelve and a half percent, we could submit it to the chief clerk's office and provide assistance. When they insisted on this arrangement, we revised the year-end accounting for the Year of the Tiger, submitted sixty ryō to the chief clerk's office, provided settlement documents with interest at year's end, requested a twenty ryō withdrawal in the Year of the Snake, and submitted the remaining forty ryō. There is no discrepancy in this. While accounting had been maintained through annual settlements up to this point, claiming hardship from private deposits without consulting relatives is entirely false. However, when the universal extension notice was issued in the recent Year of the Horse, upon informing the person in question and Buuemon, they were greatly surprised and distressed, with no way to manage support for dependents, facing difficulties in all directions and earnestly petitioning. We told them we would petition the authorities during the extended term, and provided one ryō assistance each during the Years of the Horse and Sheep, but due to our own financial difficulties, we could not continue support, leading to this lawsuit.

　Humbly submitting this oral statement as a petition
One　I have been engaged in papermaking business until now, but as business
　has become unprofitable, I wish to cease this business. I humbly request
　that you grant this petition out of your benevolence, which would be
　most gratifying. Above　　　　　　　　　　　　　Hokemochi Town

The above petition has been processed with only the bunichi tax until now, but
this time there was an internal directive that when papermakers cease operations,
both petitions are required, so we are also submitting to the rural administrative office.
This applies only to papermaking; for other commercial licenses,
such obligations will not be required in the future. Only the bunichi tax will suffice.

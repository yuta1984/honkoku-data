Humbly submitting this oral statement as a petition
My uncle Zenkichi fell into financial hardship and could not continue making a living, so he left home in the past year of Bunka 5, Year of the Dragon, and we had no choice but to petition for his absence. His elderly mother had been cared for by my father Shichirōbei until now, but Shichirōbei passed away, and I am working as a servant, so there is no one to care for her at this time, which causes great difficulty. However, the said Zenkichi is now in Edo living an honest life, so he has come forward regretting his past wrongs and wishing to petition for his return to care for his elderly mother. Therefore, I submit this petition.
I humbly request that you grant this petition out of your benevolence, which would be most gratifying. Above　　Hokemochi Town

From this year, the flower lottery was suspended with one person per upper and lower town district, but the officials have gathered and ordered that it be conducted as one stream across ten towns, so we will conduct the lottery across ten towns. Supervisors will be appointed two towns at a time in rotation. This year's supervisors are Honmachi and Yokomachi. Regarding the petition documents, as this year's schedule is pressing, we submit them within the town districts.

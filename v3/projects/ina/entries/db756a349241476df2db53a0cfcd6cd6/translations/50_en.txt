Written pledge submitted:
Regarding my sickle trading business, I have caused suspicion and have no excuse to offer. I humbly apologize for this transgression. From now on, not only sickles but also any new agricultural tools among blacksmith products shall not be sold.
In this matter, through your exceptional benevolence, you have pardoned the charges against me, for which I am most grateful and fortunate. Therefore, I submit this written pledge.

Regarding this recent case, pawnshops are treated specially, so new agricultural tools shall not be bought or sold at all. Matters concerning tool handles are at one's discretion.
Since other shops have been ordered that agricultural tools, both new and old, are not permitted, Tōemon has unavoidably also submitted a written pledge. Of course, among the townspeople, those who submitted pledges this time are: Hokimochi-machi Tōemon, Shimomo-machi Seishichi, Naka-machi Kanshirō, Jibei, Sueyoshi, Honmachi Shōzō, Chūzaemon, Yahei, Chūshichi, Hikobei, Heiemon, Yoko-machi Monjūrō, Sōbei - a total of thirteen establishments.

Humbly submitted petition in writing:
One　I have fallen into difficult circumstances, so I wish to cease oil pressing operations
Regarding the above matter, if you would graciously grant this petition with your benevolence, I would be most grateful and fortunate. Respectfully submitted.

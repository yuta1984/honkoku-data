Document Regarding the Receipt of Money

Item: 250 ryō in gold　　　　Note: Written amount only
The above amount is part of the funds accumulated for this estate, specifically the portion that Lord Itakura Kai-no-kami has contributed. As this sum is now being collected, we hereby acknowledge the proper receipt and custody of said money at this estate. Regarding repayment: beginning next March, we shall pay 5 ryō as the principal payment plus 3 bu 2 shu as additional payment, totaling 5 ryō 3 bu 2 shu monthly without fail until the reserve meeting. As this matter involves important obligations to the honorable members, if there were any delays, even double repayment would be difficult to accomplish. Therefore, having obtained full understanding from our master and reached agreement among all senior officials, we will without fail repay according to the established terms of the accumulated funds. This document serves as proof of receipt and custody of the money for future reference. Thus it is recorded.

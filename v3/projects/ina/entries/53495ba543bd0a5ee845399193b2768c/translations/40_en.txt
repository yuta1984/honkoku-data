Regarding gold and silver currency, although recoining was previously ordered, the matter of nishu-ban (two-shu coins) was set aside at that stage. However, by year's end, some coins had become worn from handling, causing the hallmarks to fade, and there are reports that some nishu-ban have become difficult to distinguish. This time, recoining has been ordered. However, since nishu-ban are heavy, daily carrying becomes quite difficult when in large quantities. Moreover, when sending them to distant provinces, this becomes even more problematic. This being reasonable, from now on, each coin shall be reduced in weight by seven fun and put into circulation. The matter of exchanging these coins need not be mentioned further. This policy shall be announced to all provinces.

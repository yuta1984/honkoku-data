Due to severe damage to sacred objects and other items, requiring repairs,
permission is granted for fundraising assistance in the above five provinces.
Carrying fundraising documents with the joint seals of the magistrates of temples and shrines,
from the 5th month of the current Year of the Tiger until the 5th month of the Year of the Dragon, fundraising may be
conducted in shogunal lands, private domains, temple and shrine lands, rural areas, and towns.
During this period, faithful believers should make donations
regardless of the amount. For shogunal lands,
this should be announced by the deputies (daikan), and for private domains by the domain lords and local administrators.

Regarding summons papers issued when rural residents are called for interrogation and cross-examination by the magistrate's office: these papers are delivered to Edo lodging houses, which then send them to villages via couriers. The courier fees were previously collected on the spot from those who received the papers. However, recently it has been reported that some people are bringing forged papers, falsely claiming to be couriers from Edo lodging houses and fraudulently collecting courier fees, causing trouble for the villages. Therefore, from now on, courier fees should not be paid on the spot. Instead, after the person who received the summons arrives in Edo, they should negotiate with the Edo lodging house that handled the paper, and the fees should be paid locally. This policy has also been communicated to the Edo lodging houses, so please understand this arrangement.

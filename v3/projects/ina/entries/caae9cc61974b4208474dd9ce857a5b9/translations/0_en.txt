Should we not redeem them upon expiration of the term, the deed shall be rewritten at that time as you see fit. Regarding these fields, no outsiders, nor any relatives or family members, shall interfere. Should anyone raise troublesome disputes, we will go anywhere to settle the matter decisively and cause you no inconvenience whatsoever. For future evidence, this document is executed as follows:

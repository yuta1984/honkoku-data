This time, the ship of Genhachi from Kaketsuka in Tōtōmi Province, with offshore captain Matsusuke and six sailors aboard, was carrying rice shipments for the lord as well as cargo belonging to townspeople when, on the 14th of last month, it encountered disaster in the waters off Jōgashima, which is under the jurisdiction of this place. They abandoned the original vessel and were rescued by a boat belonging to Kanroku from the same province and location, entering Koami-dai Kimura Harbor. Search vessels were promptly dispatched, for which we are most grateful. Due to the great storm, the original vessel has surely drifted far out to sea, and since there are no remaining concerns about it, we wish to abandon the rice cargo to the sea and obtain a harbor certificate from the village to conclude harbor procedures.

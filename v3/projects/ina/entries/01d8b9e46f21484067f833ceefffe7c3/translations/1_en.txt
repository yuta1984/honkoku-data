Regarding the written pledge we respectfully submit:

Item: Concerning the stone cutters of our village, we have investigated thoroughly throughout the entire village and submitted our report. There is not a single other person beyond those already reported. Moreover, when they go out to work as stone cutters, they do not take on stone cutting apprentices at their destinations. Furthermore, we have instructed them in detail to conduct themselves properly according to actual conditions at their destinations, and they have acknowledged and understood these instructions completely. Should there be any questionable matters in the future that come to your attention, please immediately report from your location. Whatever punishment may be imposed upon us, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. This joint seal document serves as proof for future reference. The above is respectfully submitted.

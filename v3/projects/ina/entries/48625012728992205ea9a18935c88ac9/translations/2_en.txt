As for myself, there is nothing particular to worry about, so
please be at ease.
I take this fortunate opportunity to write to you. During this lingering heat
of summer, I hope that everyone
is in good health.
This would be most felicitous.
Now then, regarding the matter of my family,
I humbly request your kind consideration in all respects.
First, I wished to convey the above matter, and thus
I send you this letter. That is all.

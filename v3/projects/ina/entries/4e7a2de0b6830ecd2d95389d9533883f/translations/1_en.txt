Oral Report

Furthermore, I should have sent a written report with my previous correspondence, but being caught up in various matters, I was unable to do so. Please continue to excuse me for this recurring situation.

I humbly write to you. The weather is gradually becoming warmer, and I trust you are in good health. Here, your family members are all increasingly in good health, which I am most pleased to hear. Even if only a little, I received various kindnesses when I departed, which I consider a truly grateful blessing. The journey proceeded safely, and I arrived in Edo. From there, I have been gradually consulting with your esteemed father and everyone else regarding the business matters. I have been negotiating since the other day, and although I am making efforts on all fronts, these are not yet matters that can be settled. Regarding my return home, I cannot predict when it might be. However, I hope to complete the information exchanges within this month and return home. Please convey this to all your family members. I state this here, and will provide details upon my return home.

Respectfully and humbly,

March 5th　　　Kan'emon

To Ikegami Kichibei

Postscript: I humbly make a request. I am sending some items along with your esteemed father's luggage, so please kindly receive them when I return home. Particularly regarding one item of new tea, if it is convenient for you and you have some available, I humbly request that you send it.

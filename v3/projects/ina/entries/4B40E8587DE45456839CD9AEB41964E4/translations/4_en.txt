1. After that, I made courtesy calls to the Senior Councilors Lord Wakasa-no-kami and Lord Noto-no-kami to express gratitude. The verbal statement was as follows:
　　　I have today received the honor of being granted hawks and wild geese, which I consider a most grateful fortune. Regarding this expression of thanks, due to illness I am conveying this through my representative.

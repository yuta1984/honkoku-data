[Respectful heading] I humbly apologize for troubling Your Honor repeatedly, but I would like to present the remaining matters orally. I most humbly request that by Your Honor's compassion, you summon the aforementioned Sadajirō of Yamuro Village, investigate the matter, and order him to settle the accounts. If this could be granted, it would be a most grateful blessing.

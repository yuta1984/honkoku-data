Respectfully submitting this petition in writing

Item: I previously engaged in stone-cutting work as a traveling laborer, and for several years worked as a stonemason with one Shinpei of Shimakamijoson Village in Koma District, Koshu Province, as my regular lodging. However, when I was appointed to the position of village headman in the 12th month of Tenpo 13 (1842), Year of the Tiger, I was asked to transfer my stone quarry concession rights to Teijiro, the younger brother of Saburoemon of Yamumuro Village. Therefore, I transferred to him without exception all account books from Bunka 10 (1813), Year of the Rooster, through Tenpo 13 (1842), Year of the Tiger—a period of thirty years—along with the accumulated stones, household goods and tools, bedding and futon, mosquito nets, tatami mats, and stone-cutting tools. In exchange, we made an agreement that from Tenpo 14 (1843), Year of the Rabbit, through the coming Year of the Rat, over a period of ten years, three ryo of gold per year would be sent without fail from Teijiro's household to mine, with the aforementioned Saburoemon acting as guarantor. Additionally, we arranged that he would send the remaining fifteen ryo or more in gold that had been advanced for craftwork as soon as he received payment. In the third year of the Rabbit he sent two ryo, in the Year of the Dragon one ryo, and in the Year of the Snake two bu—a total of three ryo and two bu over three years. However, despite my repeated demands thereafter, he claims to have fallen ill while traveling or to have incurred new craftwork advances, and has sent no money whatsoever to my household. Meanwhile, he became an adopted son-in-law to the impoverished widow of one Jōemon in the village, who possessed only a house and residence but no rice field assessment, and undertook major construction work on the house.

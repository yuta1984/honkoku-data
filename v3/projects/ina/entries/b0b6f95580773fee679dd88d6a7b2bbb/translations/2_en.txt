Although the previous rent was two bu of gold per year, during this lease term, regardless of the tenant's circumstances, we will pay one bu of gold per year, delivering it without fail to the monthly duty officer by the 28th day of the 12th month each year. Furthermore, not only will we handle roof repairs, but our group will take responsibility for all repairs and maintenance to ensure the property does not fall into disrepair. Additionally, since we will undertake special repairs this spring, we have agreed to waive the rent for this year only. Should any difficulties arise concerning the tenant, our village group will take responsibility and resolve them definitively, causing no trouble whatsoever to you gentlemen. This serves as our guarantee document for future reference.

This time, regarding the sacred land that belongs to you, I have received in perpetual transfer the land as specified in the deed, and this is certainly correct. However, concerning the Kawahigashi road, as has been the custom, you may pass through my land from the ditch edge at the bottom of the marsh as you see fit. Regarding this road matter, I will never cause any violations or disputes in the future. This is a written agreement established as proof for posterity. Therefore, as stated above.

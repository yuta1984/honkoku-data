Document of Submission

Article 1: Regarding the stonecutters of our village, we have investigated and compiled a list throughout the village, and there is no one else beyond these.

Article 2: The stonecutters shall not employ disciples or apprentices at their travel destinations where they go to work. Furthermore, we have instructed them in detail to report thoroughly on the actual conditions at their travel destinations, and they have acknowledged each point. Should there be any negligent matters hereafter that come to your attention later, please report immediately from your end. Even if any form of punishment is imposed upon us, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. This document with joint seals serves as proof for future reference. Therefore, as stated above.

Regarding the announcement made last year in the year of the Dog, since there are still many coins to be exchanged, the exchange process will continue as before until the 10th month of next year, the year of the Rat. For all matters, follow the instructions as previously announced, and ensure exchanges are completed by that deadline. For government lands, deputy magistrates should carefully instruct this; for private domains, domain lords and land stewards should do so. That is all.
As stated above, an official document has been issued from the government, so it should be announced throughout the town. That is all.
11th month

If anyone matching the above descriptions is found, detain them at that location. For government lands, report to the deputy magistrate; for private domains, report to the domain lord or land steward, who should then report to the monthly rotating temple and shrine magistrate in Edo. Anyone who sees or hears of them should also report accordingly. Of course, retainers and servants should also be carefully examined. Concealing information will be considered a crime if discovered from other sources.

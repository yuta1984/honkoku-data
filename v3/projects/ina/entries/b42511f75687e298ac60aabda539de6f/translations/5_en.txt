A Written Pledge Respectfully Submitted

Regarding gambling and betting of all kinds of contests, which have been repeatedly prohibited, we shall strictly observe all official directives without exception. Among us there have been those who acted contrary to regulations, resulting in official seizure, for which we are deeply ashamed. Hereafter, the five-household group heads shall strictly ensure compliance. Should there be anyone who acts contrary to the regulations, neighbors and group members shall earnestly provide counsel to reform their behavior. Even after such efforts, should their misconduct come to official attention and whatever punishment be decreed, we shall offer no excuse whatsoever. Therefore, we all jointly affix our seals and submit this pledge without any falsification. The above.

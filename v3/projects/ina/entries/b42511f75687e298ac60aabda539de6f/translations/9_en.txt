A Written Pledge Submitted

Regarding gambling and betting on various games, which have long been strictly forbidden by your orders, we pledge to rigorously observe all prohibited matters. However, there have been those who misunderstood their obligations, resulting in official seizures, for which we deeply apologize. Henceforth, we shall establish strict agreements within our five-household groups and absolutely observe the prohibited matters. Should there be anyone who misunderstands their obligations, neighboring households and group members will earnestly admonish them. If they do not comply and any member of our group commits improper acts that come to your attention, regardless of what punishment we may receive, we shall offer no excuses whatsoever.

Therefore, we all affix our seals together and submit this pledge, and there are no discrepancies in our commitment.

The above,

Pledge Document Submitted

Regarding the gambling and betting on various games of chance that have been repeatedly prohibited by proclamation, we shall strictly observe all forbidden matters without exception. Among us there have been those who acted improperly, resulting in official intervention, for which we are deeply ashamed. Hereafter, each five-household group shall mutually agree strictly among themselves to absolutely observe the prohibited matters.

Should there be anyone who acts improperly, the neighboring household group members shall earnestly offer advice to reform their behavior. If such advice is not heeded and any member of the group commits improper acts that come to official attention, regardless of what punishment may be imposed, we shall offer no excuse whatsoever. Therefore, we all affix our seals jointly and submit this pledge, which contains no falsehoods. The above.

　　　　　We humbly submit this written petition

One: My father Ihei had his position as village elder revoked in Tempo 8 (1837) due to misconduct, but in Keio 3 (1867) he was restored to his elder position as before. Therefore, we respectfully petition that he be appointed as forest guardian of the government forest and mountains as in previous years. If you would graciously grant this petition with your benevolence, we would be most grateful.

We would be fortunate if the petition submitted by the aforementioned Yoshiemon could be granted as requested.

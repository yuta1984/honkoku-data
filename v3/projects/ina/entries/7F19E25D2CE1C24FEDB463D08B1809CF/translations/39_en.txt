We humbly submit this petition in writing

Three men from Kiso Suga Village—Magoichi, Kinzo, and Yoemon—have petitioned to enter the mountains at a place called Saruhashi in Oguro River to harvest comb wood. I would like to serve as their contractor and pay the mountain duties (yamashiro) to the authorities. We humbly request your compassion and ask that you approve this petition as submitted.

Petitioner: Ohane Heiju

We request that the petition submitted by the aforementioned Heiju be approved as requested.

As stated above, during this Year of the Horse, while we were contracted to deliver the timber, there was driftwood, but we petitioned that no loss would be caused to the authorities, and after receiving approval, we proceeded with gradual logging. However, due to unexpected repeated floods, the timber was washed away, and each of the loggers has suffered hardship. Though it is inappropriate to submit such a petition at this late stage, we humbly request that you show extraordinary compassion and provide relief.

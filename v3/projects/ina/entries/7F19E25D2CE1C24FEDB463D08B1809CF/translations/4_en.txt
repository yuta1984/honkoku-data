The nearby mountains have aged and become old-growth forests, and it now takes many days to harvest timber from the mountains. The people of the woodcrafter villages are struggling desperately. Therefore, we request an increase in the payment rates for various official timber items. If you would graciously grant our request as petitioned with your mercy, all the people of the woodcrafter villages would consider it a most grateful fortune. The above.

　　　We humbly submit this written petition
I was affected by a conflagration last December and have no private forest lands whatsoever. Therefore, I petition that miscellaneous trees be sold to me from the village's government forest. If you would graciously grant this request with your mercy, I would consider it a most grateful fortune.

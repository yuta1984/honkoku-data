　　　Honorable Magistrates

We humbly submit this written petition.
We make our living operating medicinal hot springs, and as the number of bathers is gradually increasing, we believe this may contribute to the prosperity of the area. Therefore, we would like to borrow land along the upper road to the hot spring entrance within your forest domain to construct buildings for lodging and rest facilities for the bathers. Regarding this matter, we humbly submit our petition. If you would most graciously grant our request as petitioned through your special benevolence, we would be most grateful.

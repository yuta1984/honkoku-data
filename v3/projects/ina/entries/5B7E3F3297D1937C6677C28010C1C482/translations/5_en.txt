Wearing hats and standing in front of the main entrance is not permitted regardless of weather conditions, so this should be done elsewhere.

1. Umbrellas should be wrung out under the gate. Of course, those of hereditary retainer status and above understand this on their own, but attention should be paid to those in the large quarters and townspeople. The same applies to outsiders - they should wring out their umbrellas.

1. When the Shogun makes a formal visit and there is an official notice for gate pass restrictions, when official messengers or retainers from within the mansion need to go outside the gate, they must obtain the name and official seal of the monthly duty magistrate (ōmetsuke) to pass through. Of course, the Shogun's attendants have been allowed to pass without passes until now.
During the formal visit, the gate doors are kept closed, but when there is an order from the lower magistrate to open them halfway, the small side gate is opened, and it is closed again when the Shogun returns.

However, when there is a formal visit to Ueno, to the camp grounds, or when passing through Hitotsubashi-dōri, Kiji-bashi-dōri, or Ogawa-machi, since these are near the mansion, the caretaker and checkpoint guards are deployed for security as advance guards. The checkpoint guards use six-foot poles according to established custom to block off the streets, clear people away, and stop traffic. When there is such street security, a lower magistrate is dispatched to the gate and the side gate is temporarily closed. When there are distant formal visits or visits within Hitotsubashi, there is no temporary closing of the side gate, and gate passes are brought individually to the monthly duty magistrate to be exchanged for official seal passes, which are then received at the gate for passage.

1. Within the stone pavement in front of the main entrance, except for those of elevated status who are permitted to wear high geta, even if others pass through, high geta are not permitted. Even outsiders - foot soldiers and below, attendants, and townspeople - are not permitted to wear high geta, so this should be done elsewhere.

1. For merchants visiting the mansion, a side tag with their residence and name should be placed at the gate, to be exchanged for the gate merchant tag. Of course, it should be exchanged again when they return. Of course, carried goods and such must not be placed within the white edge area.

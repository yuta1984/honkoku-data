The above record of gate guard duties at the Edo mansion was copied by Yoshizawa Bakubi as a reference manual borrowed from Mr. Sakabe by the duty officer, and I borrowed it for two days to make this copy after additions were made to what he possessed. This includes various regulations that were issued from time to time, which were collected and added to what was kept in possession.

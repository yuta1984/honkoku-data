New Year's Three Days
1. Since the rear gate will be used, cotton black happi coats and brown hakama must be worn. Two guards on duty shall be posted from the morning sixth hour (around 6 AM), two people shall come out at the daytime ninth hour (around noon) for shift change, and withdraw at the evening sixth hour (around 6 PM). Regarding the keys, during this period they are kept by the ōmetsuke monthly duty officer, so the morning duty person shall come to receive them, and the evening duty person shall return them at the sixth hour.
Since lanterns are not provided recently, one paper lantern and candles must be brought from the quarters.
　However, previously on New Year's Day, one main guard served from morning sixth hour, with a replacement coming at daytime ninth hour for shift change, and the main guard would come out at seventh hour (around 4 PM) until fifth hour the next morning (around 8 AM). Additionally, one assistant guard would come out at morning sixth hour, with an evening assistant coming for shift change at daytime ninth hour, withdrawing at seventh hour.
　On the third day, even the main guards would withdraw at evening sixth hour.
　Previously duties were performed as described above, but after Katsumura Kōzō, who was employed as an ashigaru, came to reside at the rear gate guardhouse, the duty system in recent years became as described in the main text. At that time, the keys were kept by the caretaker.

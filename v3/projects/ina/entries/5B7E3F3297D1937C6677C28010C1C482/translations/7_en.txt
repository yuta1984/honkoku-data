However, for predetermined refusals, advance notice is given, and naturally for cases requiring passage on occasion, notice will be given by the guard captain at that time.

1. When calling out the names of daimyo lords, for names containing "shōyū" (assistant), for example "Kunai-shō-sama" should be called out only as such, and "shōyū" should not be called out in full, according to the directive. This directive was given on New Year's Day of Tenpō 2, Year of the Rabbit, by Yasuhiko Heizaemon. As stated above, for lords such as someone Kunai-shōyū-sama or Nakatsukasa-shōyū-sama, only "something-shō-sama" should be called, omitting the character "yū" from the announcement, and it should never be said in full. However, there is also a directive that for cases such as Matsudaira Settsu-no-kami-sama, the character "Setsu" should be omitted and he should be called "Tsu-no-kami-sama."

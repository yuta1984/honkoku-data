Government Forest of Kayama Village (Yamazumi district, Small Entrance)
The matter of granting undergrowth from these two locations to Oshima Village, Kawate Village, Aoshima Village, and Nosoko Village in Kawashimo-guchi came about because during the cultivation of Rokudohara (present-day Suehiro Village) in previous years, these four villages frequently complained that this was their common-use area and the situation interfered with fertilizer for their rice fields. Therefore, it was explained that substitute grass would be provided from government forests, and subsequently undergrowth began to be granted from the government forest of Nakamura in Fujisawa district, with annual labor service performed for harvesting.
However, Nakamura complained that crops were being trampled and damaged by large numbers of horses, causing hardship. The four villages also complained that there was no place to tether horses and, moreover, transportation was difficult due to the remote location. Due to these complaints from both sides, in the previous year of the Sheep, it was ordered that the undergrowth grants be transferred to the government forest of Kayama Village.

Government Forest of Kitabayashi Village (Tenjin Forest)
The existence of a Tenjin shrine within this government forest is from ancient times, though the year and month of its establishment are unknown. During the land survey in the 3rd year of Genroku (1690), even before the former Takato domain period, the forest registry recorded it as "Tenjin Forest," so its origins are unclear. All shrine maintenance is conducted at village expense, and it is a village custom that the forestry prefecture (office) has had no involvement whatsoever from the beginning.

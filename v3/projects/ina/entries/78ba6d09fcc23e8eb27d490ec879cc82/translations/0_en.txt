Written Pledge Submitted

Regarding the matter of gambling, we humbly acknowledge and fearfully accept the instructions given to us through the written directive. We have thoroughly read and explained these instructions to all men and women in our respective households, down to the lowest members, and have strictly ordered compliance. From now on, the five-person groups will coordinate with each other, remain vigilant without negligence, mutually watch over one another, and conduct investigations. Should there be any suspicious persons, we will immediately report them to the authorities. If anyone acts improperly while knowing about it but failing to act, or if they conceal such matters and they are later exposed by others, not only the perpetrator and the lodging house, but also all members of the mutual responsibility group may be sentenced to severe punishment. In such cases, we will not cause any trouble whatsoever to the honorable authorities. As proof for future reference, we submit this pledge document with the joint seals of our mutual responsibility group members, therefore as stated herein.

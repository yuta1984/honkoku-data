A written pledge submitted

Regarding the prohibitions and regulations that have been constantly proclaimed, we humbly acknowledge and fearfully accept them. In particular, we have been repeatedly instructed that if anyone within the five-person group violates the prohibitions or conducts themselves improperly, we should admonish them, and if they do not heed our advice, we must report the matter to the town representatives. We acknowledge these instructions.

However, within our group, two persons - Yamagataya Tarōbei and Enshūya Kiyomatsu - have violated the prohibitions, which we consider extremely improper. Nevertheless, the other members of our group were completely unaware of such conduct, and we deeply regret and are ashamed of this current reprimand.

Regarding this matter, it was reported to the authorities, and while both the individuals in question and our entire group should have received severe punishment, we submitted a petition through the town representatives. Through your mercy, you have graciously pardoned us this time, for which we are deeply grateful.

Given this clemency, we will never again engage in such improper conduct. Moreover, not limited to these two individuals, we will regularly consult among ourselves to ensure that no one in our group errs in judgment, and we will strictly observe the great laws. Should anyone in our group violate the prohibitions in the future, our entire group will accept whatever punishment may be imposed. We submit this pledge for future reference. Thus stated.

Regarding the replacement for one fire guard position that became vacant at the West Citadel (Nishi-maru), we have submitted a request for personnel. The retainer conveyed this to the supervisor of the Kobushin-gumi (minor construction group), and the submitted documents as well as other petitions that came to our attention are recorded separately as noted.

Regarding Eitarō, though his rice stipend is modest and there is no increase in income this time, this person's character is virtuous and upright. His personal conduct and household management are exemplary, needless to say. Furthermore, we have heard that his filial piety toward his adoptive father Gyōzō during his lifetime and his general conduct were excellent. This was reported as admirable behavior, and a response was provided after inquiry in the 12th month of Tenpō 6 (1835).

Regarding martial arts, his adoptive father Gyōzō was an instructor, and [Eitarō] has devoted himself wholeheartedly to training as follows:

Regarding the above inquiry, at the time of receiving his license, he became as accomplished as his adoptive father Gyōzō, who served as an instructor.

Regarding the above inquiry, he continues to serve diligently without neglect, always striving to excel. In all matters, he is an outstanding person, quite remarkable for someone of low rank. This time as well, his supervisor earnestly petitions on his behalf. Generally, he holds the rank of haori-kaku (a mid-level samurai rank), but with special consideration, we have preliminarily consulted about placing him in a position appropriate to his rank and status.

As there are also the contents of the separate document extracts, and other similar precedents exist as noted in the extracts, we should investigate the matter of Eitarō. We humbly seek your wise consideration on this matter. Above.

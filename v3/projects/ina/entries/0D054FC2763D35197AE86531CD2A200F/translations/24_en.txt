Kansei 5, Year of the Water Ox, October 18th
There was a Noh performance to entertain the court nobles, and viewing was ordered for the Gosanke (three main Tokugawa branch houses), hereditary daimyo, Kōke families, Kari-no-ma attendants, Gōsōsha-ban officials, Kiku-no-ma attendants, Goen-tsura attendants, and various other officials.

1. Regarding today's Takenoma seat magistrate duty, yesterday's posted notice listed the names of Arima Saheiji-no-suke-dono and ourselves. The attendants from yesterday informed us of this by letter as a heads-up, so upon arriving at the castle, I consulted with Saheiji-no-suke-dono.

1. Concerning serving as Takenoma seat magistrate, I consulted with the metsuke (inspector) about receiving a meal before the intermission. Before the intermission, Saheiji-no-suke-dono and I received the meal in the Naka-no-ma (middle room).

1. After completing the preparations with formal dress and ceremonial umbrella, I proceeded to the Kari-no-ma and took my designated position. Soon after, one of the guard captains announced that the inner palace attendants had arrived and were seated in the Fuyō-no-ma (Lotus Room). Since Saheiji-no-suke-dono came and said he would provide guidance, I remained in the designated position to welcome them.

1. With Saheiji-no-suke-dono leading, the Owari Dainagon (Lord of Owari), Kii Chūnagon (Middle Counselor of Kii), and Mito Shōshō (Minor Captain of Mito) made their entrance. There were formal greetings, and they passed through the designated area before taking their seats. After their seating, I remained in the designated position. Saheiji-no-suke-dono, myself, and the guard captains took our seats, and shortly after, Kyōgoku Bizen-no-kami-dono of the wakadoshiyori (junior council) arrived, took his designated seat, and the meal was served.

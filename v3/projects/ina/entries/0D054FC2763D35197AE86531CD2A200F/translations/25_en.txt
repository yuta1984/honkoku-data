1. After the meal was served, the rōjū (senior councilors) appeared and gave their greetings. Regarding the wakadoshiyori (junior councilors) who in previous years similarly appeared, I inquired with the metsuke (inspector). There were no clear greetings, and Bizen-dono, who was present, informed us that in previous years there were greetings similar to those of the rōjū, but according to recent precedent, they do not appear. Understanding this accordingly, after one round of serving with the ceremonial bowls was completed, Saheiji-no-suke-dono and I withdrew as prescribed and offered greetings saying "Please partake at your leisure."

1. After one round with the sake vessels was completed, both of us withdrew and said "Please partake of the sake" before retiring from our seats. Again, one round of sake vessels was served, and the ceremonial stands (oshimazudai and oshinodai) were brought out. As Andō Tsushima-no-kami-dono arrived, Saheiji-no-suke-dono greeted him, and Saheiji-no-suke-dono announced that Tsushima-no-kami-dono had come as an envoy. After this was completed, sake vessels were served again, both of us withdrew and offered greetings. Then all the meal service was removed, the wakadoshiyori withdrew, Saheiji-no-suke-dono performed the farewell ceremony as prescribed and immediately led the withdrawal procession. I remained in the designated position, the Gosanke each offered their individual farewells and departed. Since no one remained afterward, with the mindset of maintaining security, I proceeded from their former location to the vicinity of the Sakura-no-ma (Cherry Room).

There were greetings, and Lord Sahyoe-no-suke announced that Lord Tsushima-no-kami had come as an envoy. Then all the dining utensils were cleared away, the young elders withdrew, Lord Sahyoe-no-suke performed the farewell greeting as planned, and immediately led the way for their departure. We remained in position as planned. The Three Houses each offered their individual greetings and departed. Since no one remained afterward, with the mindset of standing guard, we proceeded from their former location to the vicinity of the Sakura Room.

1. Today, a certain person was appointed as both the Takenoma (Bamboo Room) seating magistrate and announcer-attendant. Since a seating magistrate was appointed to the position of inspector, it was conveyed that meals would be served in the Nakanoma (Middle Room). The procedures for the banquet were coordinated with the announcer-attendant. When the second Noh performance began before the intermission, coordination was made with the seating magistrate regarding the banquet for the court nobles, and after going to the Middle Room to serve the meal, [the official] returned to the Noh viewing seats. After the intermission was completed and the ceremonial lacquered containers were cleared away, [the official] proceeded to the Karinoma (Wild Geese Room) at an appropriate time and took a seat at the designated location.

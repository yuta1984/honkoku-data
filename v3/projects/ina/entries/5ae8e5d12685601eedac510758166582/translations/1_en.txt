License for Festival Sumo Four-Pillar Ring Style and Drum Tower

One: In Takato Town, Ina District, Shinano Province, through the assistance of various parties,
grand sumo tournaments are occasionally held. In connection with this, there was a sincere petition
to the tutelary shrine Hokomochi Sanbashira Daigongen Shrine of the same location, and the four-pillar
ring style and drum tower were dedicated to the shrine. Hereafter and into the future, the group of
signatories shall maintain this arrangement and we humbly request the continuation of sumo tournaments for generations to come. Therefore,
even if practitioners of the same profession should come in the future, they shall never
interfere with the aforementioned four-pillar ring style and drum tower.
This serves as a license to that effect, therefore as stated herein.

Respectfully submitted through this oral petition
We have been engaged in the pawnshop business for many years under your tolerance,
making our livelihood thereby. However, in recent years, one after another, term-limited pawn businesses
have become subject to licensing, and those operating with full commercial rights have gradually declined,
causing us hardship. Under these circumstances, there are still others who petition for licenses,
and should they be granted permission, it would make it increasingly difficult to continue our livelihood.
This is an immediate concern that worries us. Recently, several shops
have each seen their business completely decrease, and today's

business operations are not sustainable, which we find truly lamentable. Respectfully, regarding this matter,
we humbly request your wise consideration and that measures be taken
limited only to those who have been licensed until now.
Not fearing to make this earnest petition, we ask for your extraordinary
compassion so that we may continue our livelihood permanently, and humbly petition you.
Regarding the above matter, we petition through your mercy that you would
graciously command as we have requested, which would be a most grateful blessing. Above stated.

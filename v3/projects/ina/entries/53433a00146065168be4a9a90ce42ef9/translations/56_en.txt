Commercial License Inspector
Ito Yosaburo
Same as above
Kurokouchi Jinjuro
Town Representative
Tsutsumi Tozo

To the Magistrate's Office
Submitted on March 27th, approval was granted, and instructions were given to Tozo to submit the license matter to the Civil Administration Bureau on April 4th.

Humbly submitted,
The roads in our town district have become deteriorated, causing great difficulty for people and horses. Since there are many impoverished people in our town, we cannot manage repairs ourselves. Although we are ashamed to make requests in these troubled times, we humbly petition that you show compassion and provide assistance for people and horses so that repairs can be completed. All residents of the town district earnestly make this request.
If you would graciously grant our petition as stated above, we would consider it a most fortunate blessing.

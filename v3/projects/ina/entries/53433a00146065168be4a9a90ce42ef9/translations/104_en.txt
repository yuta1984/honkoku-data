I humbly petition with this written statement.
Regarding my personal matter: Since last year I have suffered from apoplexy syndrome which has caused my hearing to deteriorate, making it difficult to hear various matters. Recently, after catching a cold, I have developed severe phlegm and coughing, and lately my tinnitus has worsened to the point where I can barely hear anything. As I cannot adequately fulfill my official duties, I request to retire from public life for medical treatment. Above stated.

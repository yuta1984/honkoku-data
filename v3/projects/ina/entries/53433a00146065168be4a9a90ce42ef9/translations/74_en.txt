On September 12th, submitted to Mr. Yanuma at the prefectural office, and approval was granted the following day, the 13th.
On the 20th, as cargo was being sent to Tokyo, ten ryō in stock money was paid. Since Mr. Kondō Yoshio is stationed in Tokyo, he kindly carried it there. Due to scribe Mr. Ikeda Sadahito's transfer, we were told that new stock certificates would be brought at this time.

　　Humbly submitting this written petition
First, regarding the distance along the Ina Highway between Takatō town and the post stations of Ina District,
　the route has been extended, and for several years the porters have been
　complaining of hardships during relay transport duties. However, since we have
　traditionally carried out official duties at this location, we have strictly
　instructed them that such complaints are unacceptable. But regarding the distance of two ri and eight chō,
　we do not know from how many years ago this measurement has been
　passed down, as everyone speaks of it as a distant place

Furthermore, in Keio 4 (year of the dragon, 1868), I was commanded to return to the position of town elder, and was appointed to continue the messenger role as before. In Ansei 4 (year of the snake, 1857), my son Shozo was commanded to serve as an apprentice messenger and received a stipend, for which I am deeply grateful for Your Lordship's profound benevolence. Additionally, I have received imperial clothing, formal court dress, and various gifts on multiple occasions. Last snake year, I was granted permission to use a walking stick within the Sannomaru compound, which is an extremely fortunate blessing for which I am most grateful. I wish to work diligently and repay Your Lordship's great benevolence, but I have been nearsighted from birth, and recently my health has particularly deteriorated. Moreover, my chronic abdominal ailment flares up frequently, causing me extreme difficulty. Although I am deeply ashamed to make this request during these times, I humbly petition that you grant me release from these official duties.

Regarding the above matter, if you could graciously command as I have petitioned through your mercy, it would be most grateful. The above.

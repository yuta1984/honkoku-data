25 ryō was to be provided by my master Yamagishi Heihachi of Shimōōshima Village on the 28th day of the 12th month last year, and the remaining 50 ryō was to be provided by myself, as agreed upon in our discussions. Regarding the funds for this arrangement, goods have been deposited with my master Heihachi, worth approximately 30 ryō, and we had established an agreement that this amount would be promptly paid. However, he has not paid it at all. Additionally, there are 10 ryō remaining from the sale of a storehouse, held by Yamasuya Heiji of Shinmachi, but Heihachi has also intervened and blocked this payment, refusing to hand it over. Consequently, this has led to repeated delays, for which I am deeply apologetic. I have repeatedly approached and pressed both Yamasuya Heiji and Heihachi, but they completely refuse to deal with the matter.

I find this extremely vexing. Originally, regarding the commercial transactions and dealings with goods from Suharaya Seibei of Kōfu, I conducted business after consulting with my master Heihachi beforehand, but fundamentally I was acting as an agent. Particularly given how matters have developed, I believe this is truly shameful before the authorities, so during the investigation I stated that I had handled matters without consulting my master Heihachi. Now that we have reached the point where private settlement discussions are proceeding, if both sources of the aforementioned funds are blocked, I will truly be in dire straits. Until now I have concealed my master's involvement and told complete lies. Whatever punishment I may receive hereafter,

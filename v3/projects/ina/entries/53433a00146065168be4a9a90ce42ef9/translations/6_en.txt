Regarding the above petition, on the 8th day of the first month at the New Year ceremony, the monthly town messenger Masaki Jinuemon served as intermediary and submitted it to the monthly accounting officer Matsumoto Yaheiji. Around the eighth hour of the same day, a letter arrived from Matsumoto Yaheiji to Jinuemon's residence stating that since Risaemon would be ill on the 9th, a representative should be sent. On the 9th at the fourth hour, we requested Jinuemon to serve as representative, and Shōzō also appeared. In the large reception room, with the pronouncement of accounting officer Yajima Hikoroku and in attendance with messengers Yamashita Suzō and Matsumoto Yaheiji presiding, release from duties was granted without delay. Both were immediately ordered to report to the bureau. At the bureau, we received gracious pronouncement from Head Accounting Senior Clerk Ano Taiji that release from official duties was granted without delay, and with a transfer letter from Matsudaira, both reported to the Civil Administration Bureau. We also received gracious pronouncement from Civil Administration Junior Clerk Nakayama Tadae, and release from the district town elder role was granted without delay.【End of red writing】

In connection with this, I wish to transfer the family headship to my son Shōzō and retire. Therefore, I respectfully petition:
If you would graciously grant this request as I have humbly petitioned through your benevolence, I would consider it a most grateful blessing. Above stated.

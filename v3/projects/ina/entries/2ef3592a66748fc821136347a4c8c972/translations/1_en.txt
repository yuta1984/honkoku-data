A Written Pledge Submitted

Regarding the matter of stonecutters in our village, we have investigated throughout the village and found that there is no one other than those listed in the separate ledger. Furthermore, we will not take on stonecutter apprentices while traveling. We have thoroughly instructed them to work honestly when they go elsewhere, and they have acknowledged each point. If you should hear of any inadequately investigated matters in the future, we will immediately report to you. Even if any punishment is imposed upon us, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. We affix our joint seals for future reference. The above is respectfully submitted.

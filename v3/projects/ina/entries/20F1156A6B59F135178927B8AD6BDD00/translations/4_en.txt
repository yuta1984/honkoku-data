　　　　Noh performance for entertaining court nobles
1. When lined up near the threshold of the fourth room of the great hall, and the elder councilors open the sliding doors of the second room,
   one presents oneself for audience, then lines up in two rows at the second side position next to the high-ranking families. This is on the wooden veranda. Around the middle of the kyōgen interlude,
   the meal reception continues to be ordered as usual. After the Teikan-
   no-ma group finishes, everyone receives their portions in the Yanagi-no-ma chamber, then proceeds to face the seat magistrate
   directly where all offer their respects, then returns to the wooden veranda. After the third piece ends, covers are placed widely,
   then comes the intermission. Around the middle of the celebratory words, return to the original position near the threshold. When finished,
   the elder councilors open the decorated paper screens as before,
   present oneself for audience and proceed to the seats, gather closely at the veranda edge, and when the elder councilors withdraw,
   express gratitude for the completion of the Noh performance with the senior member speaking.

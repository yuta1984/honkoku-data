Respectfully submitted petition

Item: Since there is an informal engagement with the daughter of Lord Karaki Ryuhaku,
I have privately discussed receiving her as my wife, and therefore humbly submit this petition.

Regarding the above matter, with your benevolent consideration, if you would
grant permission as petitioned,
it would be most grateful and fortunate.

Respectfully submitted

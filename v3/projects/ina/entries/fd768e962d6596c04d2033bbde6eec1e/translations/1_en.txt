Document of Submission

Item: Regarding the matter of stone cutters in our village, we have conducted a thorough investigation and confirm that there is not a single person beyond those listed in this year's official register. Given this situation, we have instructed the stone cutters to conduct themselves with utmost sincerity and propriety while traveling, and we acknowledge this responsibility. Should you hear that we have excluded anyone from the records and concealed their existence, please report this to the authorities. We acknowledge that should this occur, whatever punishment may be imposed upon us, we will harbor no resentment whatsoever. We submit this written pledge for future reference. Therefore, as stated above.

Regarding the official judicial decision delivered to Hokomochi Village and Ohara Village:
Item 1: In recent years, Hokomochi Village had cleared and cultivated fields on the riverbed remains of Takashima Kawahara within Benzaiten Kawahara. However, in the 5th month of the previous Rabbit year, a large group from Ohara Village came and harvested the wheat, seizing hoes and sickles, which led to a dispute. Hokomochi Village filed a complaint regarding this matter. Therefore, both parties were summoned for investigation. It was found that this disputed land was the subject of a conflict between both villages in the 5th month of the Rabbit year of Shōtoku 1st year. After investigation at that time, boundaries were established for a 10-bu field that Kojima Yatayu Oyagorōhachi had contracted, and for the remaining disputed areas, all matters were officially determined, with both parties submitting jointly signed documentary evidence.

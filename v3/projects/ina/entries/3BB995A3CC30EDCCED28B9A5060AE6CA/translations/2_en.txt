Having lost track of this procedure, the fact that a dispute arose over the development of this riverbed and Hokomochi Village filed a complaint is extremely improper conduct.
In Ohara Village's response document, they state that as per the documentary evidence submitted in previous years, they conducted no cultivation work whatsoever, but investigated the matter because Hokomochi Village had undertaken development.

Item 1: Regarding Benzaiten Kawahara, they claim that the upper area extends from Ubagafutokoro direction to Hakusan Tsurune, and the lower area extends to Kewahana direction, serving as a seasonal area for the use of the entire town community. The content of Ohara Village's response document states that regarding this riverbed, the area west of the river belongs to Ohara Village's portion, with a total of 6 tan 7 se 9 bu of rice fields and dry fields registered in the water registry, though all has been lost to flooding.

Upon investigation, since there was no discrepancy in the surveyed locations, the 6 tan 7 se 9 bu of riverbed remains may be developed depending on circumstances. As for the remaining riverbed areas, they are hereby designated as confiscated land, so neither party shall conduct any cultivation work. However, regarding the use of the riverbed for necessary purposes, this will be permitted, so both Hokomochi Village townspeople and Ohara Village may use it without discrimination for their needs.

Item 1: Regarding the Takashima riverbed areas that were confiscated in previous years, neither party shall under any circumstances conduct cultivation work. They must understand and strictly observe the terms of the documentary evidence submitted in previous years.

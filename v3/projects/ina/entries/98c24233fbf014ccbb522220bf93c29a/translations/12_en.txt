I have been acting as guarantor for these men who have been working as itinerant craftsmen, but since they returned to their villages last December, I would like to return their water service tags. Therefore, I submit this petition.
If you would graciously grant this petition as requested, it would be most grateful. That is all.

Humbly submitting this oral petition
I have been honored to be appointed as a purchasing agent until now, which I consider most fortunate. However, although I wish to serve diligently with all my efforts, I have become aged and infirm, and in recent years have become particularly sickly, so I petition for your permission to retire from this duty.
If you would graciously grant this petition as requested, it would be most grateful. That is all.

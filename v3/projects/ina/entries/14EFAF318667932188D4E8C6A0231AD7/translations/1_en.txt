The aforementioned person has been of the Jōdo sect for generations and is without doubt a parishioner of our temple. Should there be any person who belongs to the prohibited Christian sect, its associates, or any other forbidden religious sects, I (the priest) will go anywhere and definitely report this matter. I hereby provide this written statement for future reference.

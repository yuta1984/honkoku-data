　　　I humbly petition with this oral statement:
My relative Tsuru of Matsuzakaya in Fukuro-machi still has no adopted son,
so this time at Chikamura Heiemon-sama's jurisdiction in Yatsude village, Tera-go,
there is a person named Zenshichi who is under the care of Seikichi and with whom there are connections, so I have privately discussed
taking in this person along with his two children, and having Tsuru and him marry to continue the family line.
I petition for this matter.
Regarding the above matter, with mercy ———

arrived from Mr. Kitano on the same day, so it was conveyed to the Fukuro-machi district representative.

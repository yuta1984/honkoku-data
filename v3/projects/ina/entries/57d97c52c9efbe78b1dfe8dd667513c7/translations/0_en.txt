Regarding the Certificate We Respectfully Submit

Item: Besides those we have recorded this year, there is not one other person. We have carefully investigated each person throughout the village, and there are no discrepancies whatsoever. If there should be any oversight on our part and you should hear of it later, please immediately report it from your end. Regarding that matter, after your investigation, whatever punishment may be decreed, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. This serves as a jointly signed certificate for future reference.
Therefore, as stated above.

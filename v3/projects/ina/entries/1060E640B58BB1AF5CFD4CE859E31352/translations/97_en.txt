During the reign of Lord Yoriyasu【Marginal note: Later Heiets｜Heiki】

- Kaei 3 (1850), 4th month, 18th day: Following his deceased father Yōetsu's position, he was granted a stipend of 6 person-rations, appointed as physician of attendant rank, and placed under the supervision of senior officials.

- Same 7th year (1854), 8th month, 13th day: Due to administrative arrangements, he was ordered to relocate to Edo. He arrived in Edo on the 29th of the same month, and by the end of the following month, due to his diligent service in treating retainers' medical needs, he was appointed as stipendless physician and granted an increase of 1 person-ration, bringing his total to 7 person-rations.

- Same year, 9th month, 3rd day: His request to marry the sister of Yasuda Shunzō's adoptive family was approved as requested.

- Ansei 4 (1857), 4th month, 8th day: The following was declared at the senior official's residence:

"That your medical practice is immature goes without saying, but since your grandfather Chu-Ina has served our house faithfully, out of compassion you have been employed in close service. However, you do not understand the privileges of your position, neglect the vital practice that involves human lives, and consistently show negligent behavior in all aspects of your duties. When questioned about various medical knowledge, you repeatedly respond with lies and deceptions.

Your attitude of despising superiors is extremely improper. Despite repeated admonishments from us and others, you show no signs of reform. Recently, when asked about common medicine names or acupuncture points, you show complete ignorance, yet remain complacent thinking this is acceptable—such an attitude is inexcusable. Previously, when you requested leave for study and spent a long time in other provinces, nothing came of it. Upon detailed investigation, these are serious matters. Therefore, through extraordinary consideration, your rank is being reduced, and henceforth you are appointed to tea ceremony duties under the supervision of senior officials. You will not be assigned any internal medicine, surgery, or other close advisory medical duties. Only simple massage and physical therapy may occasionally be assigned. You shall attend the palace according to meal service schedules, wait in the monk's quarters, and provide treatment only upon specific orders. If you fail to understand this benevolence and continue improper behavior, strict measures will be taken at that time. You must prepare yourself from now to avoid future regret. While confinement or greater punishment should be imposed, due to special circumstances, you are ordered to remain in disciplinary restraint except when performing duties."

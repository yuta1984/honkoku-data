Document Regarding Written Agreement Violation

Item: Concerning night watch duties for fire prevention, from Miyasaka of this village to that town district, in previous years everyone performed this duty together, but in recent years the performance has become negligent. Therefore, there was consultation with the authorities regarding this matter. When Miyasaka was informed of this, they said that due to current hardship it was difficult to perform the duty. So through Gorobei and Gizaemon, consultation was made with Jinzaemon-sama and Jusaburo-sama, and it was decided that from April to October each year, from the 1st night to the 4th night of each month, and from November to March, from the 1st night to the 3rd night of each month, the duty shall definitely be performed.

Furthermore, on the 1st of each month, people from the town district shall take turns performing duty at Miyasaka, and for the rest, the duty shall be performed within the town district. Of course, regarding fire patrol matters, since this is a matter of mutual vigilance, rounds shall be made to Miyasaka. When Miyasaka sends people for duty, they shall patrol the town district. Having decided thus, henceforth no matter what new duties may arise, the duty shall definitely be performed according to the above regulations. If there should be any violation, consultation with the authorities shall be made. Furthermore, if previous customs are restored, both sides shall perform the duty together. This document for future reference, therefore as stated.

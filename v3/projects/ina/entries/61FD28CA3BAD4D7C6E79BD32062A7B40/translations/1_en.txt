I have respectfully received and read your letter. Although it is the midst of winter, the Shogun is in increasingly good spirits, so please be at ease.

Now, regarding the matter that the construction work at Sannomaru has been completed and Lady Keishoin relocated there on the 26th of last month - this is truly a joyous occasion and cause for celebration. I have understood the intent of your instruction that this matter should be reported up to the Rōjū (Senior Councilors).

With utmost respect and reverence, I humbly state this.

1. When Take went to Hokemochi village regarding full payment (kaisai), she completed payment for one plot of Shinmei field, but for the other five plots, the location of the land is uncertain, and she has not received the tenant farming rice either. Therefore, she said that while she would do anything once the investigation is completed and matters become clear, for now she cannot make full payment immediately.

1. This spring, when Zensuke along with relatives Komura Tozaemon and Ikegami Kanzaemon went to the village headman to investigate Rokubei's unpaid taxes, Hanemon stated: Regarding the matter of the five plots, when Take's position was discussed, Zensuke and the relatives said that if Take's side does not make full payment, it cannot be helped. Although you are aware of the situation, regarding the matter of payment to the authorities, we will do whatever is necessary. However, since there is also mediation involved, please urge Take's side to pay. Even if there are shortcomings, this does not mean we intend to cause trouble for the official authorities.

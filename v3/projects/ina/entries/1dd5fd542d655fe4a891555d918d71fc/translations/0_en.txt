Memorandum of Verbal Statement

Regarding what Take, the wife of Rokubei, petitioned to the village officials of Hokemochi village: she sent a messenger requesting that Rokubei's official rice tax be included within the completed annual tax payment.

Regarding what Iseya Zensuke came to petition to the village headman of Hokemochi village: concerning the matter of Rokubei about which you have heard, there are also unpaid annual taxes, and Zensuke requested that the man's allocated official rice tax be included and taken care of within those unpaid amounts. However, Village Headman Hanemon stated that since there had also been discussion from Take's side, if everything were included in that portion, Take would have various complaints. Therefore, it would be appropriate to include it in about three years' worth of unpaid amounts, send the remainder to Take's household, and continue it toward the annual tax payment - this is what Hanemon understood.

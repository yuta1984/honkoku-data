Even when scolding that person, they never
showed any defiance, and since they ate
their meals properly, I devoted my heart to caring for them.
During this time, for any various
preferred items, they never went against my wishes,
and using that person's good sense, I procured
and fed them, focusing solely on nursing care.
Gradually, I became unable to do any income-earning work,
and as various hardships led to poverty,
I had no choice but to recently take up
ceramic repair work during the intervals
between nursing duties.

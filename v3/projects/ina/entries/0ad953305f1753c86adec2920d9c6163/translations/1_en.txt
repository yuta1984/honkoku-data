A Written Pledge Submitted

Item: Regarding the matter of stone cutters from our village, we have conducted a thorough investigation and found that there are no others beyond those already reported. Given this situation, we have instructed the stone cutters to conduct themselves with utmost sincerity and righteousness while traveling, and we have acknowledged this. We understand that if it comes to your attention that we have excluded anyone from the records and concealed them, you will report this matter to the authorities. Furthermore, whatever punishment may be imposed upon us, we shall harbor no resentment whatsoever. This serves as a guarantee document for future reference, therefore as stated above.

A Written Pledge Respectfully Submitted

Item: Regarding the matter of stone cutters in our village, we have investigated throughout the village and reported our findings. There are no others besides those already reported. Furthermore, when traveling to engage in stone cutting work, we will not employ stone cutting apprentices at our destinations. We will not make detailed inquiries into the actual conditions at our travel destinations. We have understood each and every point that has been explained to us in detail. Should there be any matter that we have failed to investigate properly and you hear of it later, we will immediately report it from our side. Moreover, whatever punishment you may impose upon us, we will harbor no resentment whatsoever. We submit this joint pledge for future reference. Thus, as stated herein.

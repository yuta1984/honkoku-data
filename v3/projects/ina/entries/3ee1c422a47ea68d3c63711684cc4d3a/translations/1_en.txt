A document respectfully submitted

One: Regarding the stone cutters (stonemasons) of our village, we have investigated and compiled a complete list of all villagers, and there are no others besides these.

One: When stone cutters go out to work in distant places, they shall not employ or take on apprentices or disciples while away. Furthermore, we have thoroughly instructed them to conduct themselves with integrity while traveling, and they have acknowledged and understood each point. Should there be any negligent conduct that comes to your attention in the future, we will immediately report it from wherever they may be. Moreover, whatever punishment you may impose upon us, we will harbor no resentment whatsoever. This is a jointly signed and sealed document for future reference. Therefore, as written.

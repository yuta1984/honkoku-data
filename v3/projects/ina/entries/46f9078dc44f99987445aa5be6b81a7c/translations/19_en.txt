Regarding the circulation of gold and silver coins, although currency exchange was ordered in the past years of Ushi and U, we have heard that circulation is currently stagnant. From now on, all money changers throughout the provinces shall conduct transactions without delay, and this matter shall be strictly communicated by their respective authorities. If there are any shrine and temple personnel, townspeople, or peasants who refuse to accept the currency, the money changers shall report this to their respective authorities. This has been ordered for all levels of society, from samurai and townspeople down to the lowest ranks, to ensure smooth circulation. If there are money changers who cause difficulties and refuse to accept gold coins, they should be immediately reported to the local authorities.

As stated above, this applies uniformly throughout all provinces, not only in Kyoto and Osaka, but extending to all samurai, townspeople, and peasants. Not only local money changers but money changers throughout all provinces must observe this directive and ensure proper circulation. Those who claim difficulty in accepting the currency should immediately be reported to their local authorities for investigation and strict punishment. Furthermore, the intent of this directive should be thoroughly understood. The above.

Memorandum
Regarding the prohibition of hereditary Shinto priesthoods in local areas, appointments of blind officials, temple titles, and the wearing of Buddhist robes, which were previously decreed, we have heard that enforcement has become lax in distant provinces. Henceforth, strict enforcement shall be maintained in all rural areas and localities. The above.

Genbun Kanoe-tatsu year
The shrine of Haiji Zai-in has fallen into great disrepair, and now
a petition for its restoration has been submitted. After inspection,
financial assistance has been granted. In order to achieve
complete strict restoration of the subsidiary shrines and all facilities at that location,
it is desired to conduct fundraising throughout the domain.
As requested, permission has been granted to conduct fundraising.
Of course, this depends on people's goodwill,
and one must not argue about the amount of donations or forcibly demand
contributions. If there are any improper actions,
they shall be considered transgressions.

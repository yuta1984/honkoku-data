Memorandum
Article 1: Regarding large gold coins (ōban), they were recast during the Genroku era, but as their quality was inferior to the ancient large gold coins, it has been ordered that they be recast to match the quality of large gold coins from before the aforementioned recasting. They will be distributed to money exchangers from the eleventh month of this year, and shall be used for tribute offerings, bestowed gifts, and other transactions from the first day of the second month.
　However, one coin shall be valued at seven ryō and two bu of gold. When money exchangers purchase them, they must not reduce the said amount, and when selling them, they must not charge excessive handling fees in silver. Those who violate these instructions shall be investigated and punished.

Article 1: The Genroku large gold coins that have been in circulation until now shall cease to be legal tender entirely from the first day of the twelfth month of this year.

Article 1: Genroku large gold coins shall become scrap gold from the twelfth month of this year, so those who possess them shall bring them to Gotō Shōzaburō's establishment and exchange them for small gold coins (koban) at the scrap gold rate. They must not be stored away.
　However, regarding scrap gold, one coin shall be valued at slightly over four ryō and two bu in small gold coins.

The above instructions must be strictly observed throughout all provinces and localities.

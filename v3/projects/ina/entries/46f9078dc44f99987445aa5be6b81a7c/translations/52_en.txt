Regarding tofu, it was previously established that 3 shō 3 gō of soybeans should be used per standard mold, but in recent years there has been no inspection, and the previous regulations for tofu have been lost, resulting in different sizes being heard of among tofu shops. When new soybeans are available, annual requests are made based on soybean market prices, so according to the previous regulations, it is decided after inspection using 3 shō 3 gō grade [soybeans]. However, since the discrepancies in molding according to individual convenience have become severe, new standardized tofu molds will be distributed to tofu shops this time, and they shall conduct business properly using these molds.

Memorandum
1. Regarding the dispatch of inspectors to villages in the shogun's direct domains this time: For the routes through which these officials will pass, no cleaning of roads nor any construction work on roads and bridges shall be undertaken. It is also unnecessary for anyone to come out to escort or see them off as hospitality.

1. For these officials, beyond the number specified in the official seal, if additional personnel and horses are needed, if there is a fixed rate for pack horse fees in that place, follow that rate; if there is no fixed rate, calculate the pack horse fees based on the proportion of nearby official rates, and provide local personnel and horses. Not even one person or horse without payment shall be provided beyond what is specified in the official seal.

1. Regarding farmers selling medicine along the routes the inspectors will travel: they should be instructed to conduct business without any hesitation whatsoever.

1. In privately held villages, even if the inspection party stays overnight, minor hut construction or repairs need not be mentioned, and re-thatching should be unnecessary - this will cause no problems. For cooking utensils and such, they may borrow whatever is available.

1. Where there are not two or three houses suitable for lodging in a village, temples or places separated by villages will suffice.

1. At lodging places where they rest, necessary items such as rice, salt, miso, firewood, as well as sake, side dishes, oil, and luxury tea leaves should be sold according to the local market rates.

1. Commercial goods not available locally should be sent in advance with silver payment...

　　Gold: 17 ryō
The above concerns one portion out of the remaining three portions of the six-tenths allocation of Haginoo Imperial Forest in our village, of which three portions were previously sold off, and this one portion has now been sold to me without any discrepancy in the purchase agreement.

I shall carefully protect the Imperial Forest as instructed and will not commit any negligent acts. Regarding the official charcoal duties, I shall continue to submit them with great care as in previous years. Should I fail to comply with any instructions given, I shall accept whatever punishment may be decreed. I hereby submit this agreement certificate as assurance of the above.

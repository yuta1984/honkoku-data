In the street rumors of the prefecture as well, it is said that there are three treacherous domains in our province, and that our domain is counted among them. Upon hearing this, my hair stands on end and I cannot bear the painful indignation. This too is merely the mad ravings of temporary blind folly, but there is a saying that when one dog barks at nothing, ten thousand dogs spread it as truth. If treacherous people take advantage of opportunities to make slanderous accusations in every possible way, and should misunderstandings reach the Imperial Court, it would affect the security of our domain. Even if such rumors merely spread to neighboring domains, it would be the ultimate national disgrace.

In summary, I humbly observe that the reason why the actual achievements of the imperial renewal have not yet manifested is because we continue to cling to old ways and seek temporary comfort. If this is so, then our immediate urgent task is for high and low to cooperate with one heart, and based on the spirit of our oath, resolutely reform our domestic administration, abandon old corrupt practices, follow the Imperial Court's great undertakings above, and take measures to avoid suffering humiliation from other domains below. This is what I earnestly hope for.

As the poem says, "Brothers may quarrel within the walls, but together they defend against outside insults." How much more so if the many retainers of one domain unite their hearts in effort, each doing their utmost and striving for meritorious service - within a few months our domain government would flourish and could become a model for other domains. This is naturally expected.

Ultimately, the reason why morale has been lax and uninspired until today is due to the harmful effects of separation between high and low ranks and the blocking of channels of communication. The harm comes from rigidly maintaining old customs and pursuing policies of expediency and compromise. Emperor Shun loved to ask questions and paid attention to humble words, and the Duke of Zhou interrupted his meals to seek out worthy men. As the proverb says, even a fool may gain something from a thousand deliberations, so we should establish a council for deliberation right now.

and above, Your Lordship should abandon rigid authority and condescend to ask questions below. Regarding the essential principles of governing the world and bringing peace to the people, and the proper measures for rewards, punishments, encouragement, and discipline - needless to say, concerning all matters related to government administration, you should gather the opinions of the masses without the slightest omission. Below, we should not hesitate to express our humble and limited views, but for the sake of the nation, reveal our innermost thoughts, propose alternatives regarding what is right and wrong, engage in thorough discussion, and you should adopt those words that are acceptable and those strategies that are effective, actually implementing them in practice. Furthermore, if you employ people through public selection and ballot methods, then the channels of communication will be opened, and inspired by the glorious undertaking of treating talented people with favor, the entire domain will unite in transformation. Affairs will be conducted without commands, and corrupt practices will be eliminated without planning.

This is precisely today's urgent task and what I believe to be the actual achievement of loyally serving the Emperor. If each member of the government considers these corrupt words of mine to be acceptable, then I would like them to report this to our lord and have it resolutely implemented. However, if it cannot be implemented due to current circumstances, or cannot be carried out according to current opinion, perhaps my stubborn ignorance and obstinacy have not yet reached the level of proper discernment. I humbly pray that you will bestow clear teachings and instruct this fool - there would be no greater happiness than this.

Thirteenth day of the seventh month
Written in fear and trembling, with repeated prostrations

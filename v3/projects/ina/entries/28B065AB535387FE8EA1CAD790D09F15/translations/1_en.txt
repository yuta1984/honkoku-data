One, regarding this matter:
When we submitted our report, there was gracious consideration shown, so consulting with fellow officials,
we discussed ensuring that we do not lose
the ancient protocols and customs.
The copies of documents that the former Settsu-no-kami submitted
to the elders, the documents he ordered
his retainers and the Public Affairs Office to prepare,
as well as notifications to the domain retainers - three documents in total that Settsu-no-kami
submitted and showed to fellow officials. These
documents were also submitted to the elders by Danjō-dono.
Furthermore, the intentions that the elders had long
discussed were shown by Echizen-dono,
so it was agreed that all should understand and follow
the purport of these four documents in total.
This is how it stands. The instructions issued thus far
have been strictly observed by everyone, and as has been
consistently ordered, important official duties
of our house had been suspended, but since last year we received favorable
orders, we gratefully wish to serve diligently. This being our
greatest desire, we must make righteousness our foremost principle and
work even harder. We will continue to
give instructions, but officials especially should
thoroughly understand this, and we wish to inform
others as we notice the need.
Details have been communicated to the elders.

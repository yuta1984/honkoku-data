Regarding the mountain dispute arbitration between Kamiho Village and Akasu Village in Ina District, Shinano Province, and Miyata Village, Nakakoshi Village, and Suwagata Village in the same district and province.

The complaint from both Kamiho and Akasu villages states that the two mountains of Nakagosho and Kitagosho within the Ōtagiri area have been jointly used (iriai) with the opposing party since ancient times, with both sides cutting and extracting timber for sale. However, Miyata Village has entered the mountains without proper notification and has been cutting timber recklessly, causing damage to the forest. The three villages of Miyata, Nakakoshi, and Suwagata respond that the mountain claimed to be jointly used is in the wrong location. The three places - Nakagosho, Kitagosho, and Kurokawa-yama north of Hinoo - are lord's mountains (jitō-tateyama), recorded as "lord's mountains" (otate-yama) in the land survey record of Genroku 3, and since becoming private domain, the lord has repeatedly sent mountain workers to cut timber for sale, making it not a jointly used area.

Regarding this unclear matter, Tsuji Jintarō was dispatched to conduct an inspection of the disputed area. It was found that when this area was under the domain of Hoshina Higo-no-kami, there exists documentation establishing it as jointly used land. Subsequently, from the Enpō period onward, when cutting timber from the aforementioned mountain area, since it was under government custody, there are several stamped certificates from the accounting magistrate to Chimura Heiuemon. Additionally, there is documentation from Kondō Awaji-no-kami, who administered Kamiho, regarding timber cutting in the Genroku period. Based on these records, the number of trees cut exceeds 60,000.

Miyata claims that the area from Hinoo to Utsuki-ga-take valley is their mountain territory and that the cutting was done under joint usage rights. However, given the narrow mountain area, it clearly cannot accommodate the extraction of such a large quantity of timber, and it is undeniable that the cutting was done at Nakagosho and Kitagosho, making it clear that these are jointly used mountains.

Regarding other disputed boundaries, both sides lack evidence. Therefore, after this investigation, it is determined that the southern boundary shall be the Utsuki-ga-take valley, and the northeastern boundary shall follow the Kurokawa mountain ridge, with all five villages having joint usage rights to Kurokawa...

Furthermore, I should occasionally
send greetings by letter,
but considering how busy you must be,
I have refrained and allowed time to pass without correspondence. The above being said,

I write this brief note. First,
I humbly rejoice that
the Shogun continues in excellent health and spirits. Next, I hope
that you too remain
in robust health, which I would like to hear confirmed.
Recently, when Honda Shimotsuke-no-kami
visited your domain, he mentioned
my name in conversation, as he reported to me in detail.
I am grateful that you kept me in mind and inquired about me.
I continue to serve without change, so please
be at ease regarding my situation. Additionally, as for the
salted sea bream roe that I献上
献上 annually, I recently
sent some. I am presenting the remainder for your inspection.
I shall greet you again properly in the future. With fear and respect,
I respectfully state.　　Matsudaira Sakyo-no-Taiyu
First day of the fifth month　　　Yorizumi (monogram)
To Lord Naito Yamato-no-kami
And to all your retainers

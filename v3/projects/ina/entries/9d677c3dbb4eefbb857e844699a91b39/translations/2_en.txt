Tenpō 14, Year of the Water Rabbit (1843)
November 20th - Record of Official Notice

Given the season, pay careful attention to
fire prevention, and particularly ash dealers should be
even more cautious.
The above matters shall be announced throughout the town. That is all.
　　November

The above official notice was processed by fellow officials, and
announcements were made while visiting ten districts.

The circulation of old gold and silver coins with standard characters and two-bu denominations, old two-shu silver coins, as well as
Bunsei-era repeated-character gold and silver coins, grass-script two-bu denominations,
two-shu silver coins, and one-shu silver coins has been
ordered to cease. Since it was announced in the previous Tiger year
that these should be exchanged by October of the current Rabbit year,
there appear to be many who understand and have exchange money,
so the matter of exchange offices will
continue as before until October of the coming Dragon year.
All matters should be exchanged without negligence as previously announced,
so that even those in remote provinces and rural areas understand.
In shogunal territories, magistrates should carefully
implement this, and in private domains, domain lords and local administrators should do so.
The above matters shall be announced.

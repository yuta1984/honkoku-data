This shall be done. Regarding the matter of deducting one portion from the commission, for every 100 mon of storage fees, one portion shall be deducted from the four mon commission, and arrangements shall be made at a rate of three mon.

However, concerning the matter where Fujisawa Nakama and others, once incorporated into one of the two cargo handlers, wish to take goods to fish vendors for direct negotiated sales, this may be done at their discretion provided it continues permanently. Regarding commissions in such cases, they shall be reduced by half, the same as for direct shipments to fish vendors elsewhere.

Regarding the above matters, you shall summon the three-commodity handlers and other commercial dealers to your office and convey these instructions to them.

Regarding these individuals: Due to years of financial difficulties in domain finances, enormous debts have accumulated, making it difficult to manage through official channels. As various approaches have proven ineffective, it has been decided this time to entrust the matter to the local townspeople. Accordingly, supervisory responsibility for debt repayment has been assigned. Therefore, account books for monetary allocations and promissory note ledgers have been handed down. The town officials should be consulted, and detailed arrangements should be handled through careful consultation with the district magistrates and financial administrators.

The above matter should be communicated accordingly.

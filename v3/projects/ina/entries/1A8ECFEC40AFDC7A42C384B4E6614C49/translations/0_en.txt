I respectfully write to you.
The Shogun is in increasingly good spirits
and is well,
so please be at ease. Also, there are
no unusual matters in your domain.
His Majesty the Emperor and the Retired Emperor continue to be
in good health. We have respectfully reviewed
your letter and memorandum of the 27th of last month
and have reported to the throne. Regarding other matters,
we shall communicate as detailed in the separate document. With great respect,
I humbly submit this.

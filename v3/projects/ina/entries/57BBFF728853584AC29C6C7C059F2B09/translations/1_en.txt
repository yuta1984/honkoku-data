I have unexpectedly become the heir and am now succeeding to the headship of the house, which brings me no small fortune. Here, I shall devote myself day and night even more to reforming the administration of both the household retainers and the domain, making fair rewards and punishments my principle, and always keeping in mind the harmonious unity between superiors and subordinates. However, there may be matters in which I fall short in all things. It goes without saying that subordinates should serve with respectful loyalty and integrity. Nevertheless, when there are those who violate the laws established by successive generations, while I may leniently pardon matters that do not contradict fundamental law, I shall certainly investigate the right and wrong of matters that obstruct our institutional system. Since I am not issuing new proclamations regarding house laws at this time, all household retainers must become even more thoroughly aware of the provisions established in the first month of Kanpō 2 and strictly observe them. Moreover, regarding the provisions established in the twelfth month of Bunsei 9, they must also thoroughly understand these without omission, focus especially on prudent conduct, and strive in loyal service.

Ansei 7, first month, 19th day (Seal of Yorinao)

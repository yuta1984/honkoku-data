auction sales, causing us extreme hardship. Regarding the cotton trade, in previous years we imported bundled cotton from Osaka for sale, but recently we have reached a point where goods can only be sold through traveling sales. As for our locality, it has been declining and becoming impoverished year by year. Currently, there are countless people engaged in cotton trading and procurement, but there are no cotton ginners at all. Therefore, we believe that merchants from other regions naturally enter our territory in large numbers. We earnestly wish for cotton ginning businesses to be established in our locality. If we use the surplus from the aforementioned tribute money to arrange for people to learn the cotton ginning trade, and if many cotton ginning businesses are established, then Omi merchants could bring in raw cotton in large quantities as they did in previous years. This would primarily improve our financial arrangements, facilitate better credit, enable the continuation of our business operations, and make everything increasingly prosperous. Therefore, we respectfully request that this be granted with your compassion.

If you would graciously hear these circumstances and, with your benevolence, grant our request as petitioned, both towns would unanimously consider it a most grateful blessing. The above.

Respectfully Submitting a Petition in Writing

1. The castle town has been declining year by year, and unlike previous years, merchants from rural areas no longer come to market. Even when we stock various goods, they do not sell well, causing great hardship. While this situation affects everyone, it particularly impacts both our towns, which rely solely on commerce for their livelihood. Due to the economic downturn, house rents have decreased compared to previous years, and it has become extremely difficult to fulfill our duties as post-horse providers and inspectors, causing us great hardship. Given the recent circumstances, we respectfully request relief.

1. Cotton goods and used clothing merchants from other regions have entered our territory and conduct auction sales not only in the castle town but also in the surrounding villages. We have contracted these merchants and annually pay ten kan-mon in tribute money to the authorities. The remaining profits are used to support our post-horse duties. Recently, many cotton merchants from Suwa and Kai provinces have entered our territory and conduct auctions even in remote villages, causing us extreme hardship. Regarding the cotton trade, in previous years we imported and sold cotton in bundles from Osaka, but recently we have reached a point where goods can only be sold through traveling sales.

My subordinate surveyor on official duty
Kobushin-gumi (construction reserve corps)
Under Tsubouchi Sakyō's group
Stipend of 15 hyō and one person's support allowance　　Nishimura Tōichirō
Plus additional official allowance of three persons' support　Age 36 in the Year of the Ox

This person, on the 19th day of the 7th month of Tenpō 9 (1838), Year of the Dog, after consulting with Hayashi Higo-no-kami from his position as a retainer living in family quarters, was instructed by the same person to practice calendar calculation, surveying, and other skills at the office of his colleague Yamaji Yazaemon. On the 29th day of the 7th month of the same 10th year, Year of the Boar, he was appointed as my subordinate surveyor on official duty, and while serving in this capacity, he was granted a support allowance for three persons through a written directive from Lord Mizuno Echizen-no-kami. On the 5th day of the 8th month of the same 11th year, Year of the Rat, he was granted succession to his father Chōzaemon's position, and has served for three years in this role until the current Year of the Ox.

This Tōichirō is generally of good character with commendable work performance, possesses adequate skills in calligraphy and arithmetic, and is capable of handling significant official duties. He has consistently applied himself diligently to his surveyor duties, so I had hoped to request a suitable position should one become available. Last month on the 24th day, I learned that Ōshima Genzaemon, fire watchman at the Western Citadel, entered the construction reserve corps due to illness. If it would be possible, since this has long been the position this person desired, I would like him to be appointed to fill this vacancy. Furthermore, Tsubouchi Sakyō, who is Tōichirō's superior, has also made this request, and I similarly petition for the same. Tōichirō's father, Nishimura Chōzaemon, served under me for many years handling various official duties and had his own aspirations, for which I repeatedly made requests on his behalf, but due to illness he had to return to regular duty without fulfilling his hopes. Now Tōichirō continues as my subordinate, serving with dedication, so if he could be appointed as requested, I would be most grateful, and it would serve as encouragement to my other subordinates as well. I humbly request this matter be considered. The above.

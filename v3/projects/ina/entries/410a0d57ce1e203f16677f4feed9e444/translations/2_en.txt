Item 1: Regarding those who go to other provinces to work as stone cutters, the five-person group will conduct strict examination, verify their identities in the population register, establish guarantors, and send them out. Naturally, they will ensure that annual taxes and official duties are fulfilled without delay.

Item 2: Regarding the prohibitions issued by the Shogunate, it goes without saying that as always commanded, they will never violate the official punishments at their destinations. We have been ordered to observe this provision and understand its meaning.

Item 3: Regarding these individuals, at their destinations they will stay at designated lodgings as recorded in the side notes. If they do not return by year's end, the guarantors and the five-person group will report this matter. Of course, even when they return without incident, we will promptly notify the village officials and then report to the supervising authorities.

Additionally, even if their landholdings are small, they will entrust their fields to others to prevent them from becoming neglected. They will also instruct their wives and children to ensure that the portions they cultivate themselves are not handled carelessly before departing.

Item 1: One stone cutter　　　Principal: Katsuemon (seal)

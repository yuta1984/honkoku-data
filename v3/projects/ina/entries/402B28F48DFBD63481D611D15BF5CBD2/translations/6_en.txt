command. Starting with the battles of Kizukuri and Uchiyamato in the same province, and continuing through the campaigns in Kii, Etchū, and Tsukushi, he distinguished himself in every battle. On the 18th day of the 4th month of Tenshō 16 (1588), he was appointed Sakon'e-gon-no-shōshō with the court rank of Shō-shi'i-ge (Senior Fourth Rank Lower Grade) and was permitted to use the Hashiba surname. In this year, he built Matsusaka Castle and moved there. During the spring and summer of the same 18th year, he followed Kampaku-dono (Hideyoshi) on campaign to Sagami Province, besieged Nirayama Castle in Izu Province, and participated in the siege of Odawara Castle. After the Hōjō were destroyed, he was given the vanguard and headed for Mutsu Province. On the 17th day of the 8th month, Kampaku summoned Ujisato to Aizu Castle and granted him the six districts of Aizu plus the Ogawa estate and the Yamadō region, totaling twelve districts, along with the guardianship of Mutsu and Dewa provinces (he held lands worth 400,000 koku). He also granted the Kasai and Ōsaki territories (200,000 koku) to Kimura Ise-no-kami and his son Yahichi'uemon-no-jō, placing them under Ujisato's command. In the same

early 9th month, after Kampaku's return to the capital, rebels rose in the Kasai and Ōsaki territories and attacked the Kimura father and son. Upon hearing this, Ujisato sent a dispatch to Date Jirō Masamune and rushed there with his forces, completely suppressing the rebels everywhere. In the summer of the following 19th year (1591), Kunohe, a retainer of the Nanbu family, rebelled against his lord. Chūnagon Hidetsugu went down to suppress the rebellion, and Ujisato advanced in the vanguard to capture Kunohe's castle. As a reward for his military achievements in the previous and current years, the young lord was granted seven additional districts in Ōshū (Tamura, Yonhonmatsu, Date, Shinobu, and Katta in Mutsu, and Nagai District in Dewa, making nineteen districts in total including his original domains) (lands worth over 1.2 million koku). On the 28th day of the 12th month of this year, he was appointed Sangi with the court rank of Ju-san'i (Junior Third Rank) (though it was recorded that Ujisato became Sangi) (this does not appear in official records). In the summer of Bunroku (1592), when the Korean campaign began, Ujisato established his camp at Nagoya in Hizen Province, and in the spring of the following second year, he suddenly fell ill and began coughing up blood.

Having received orders for the vanguard, they attacked close to the royal capital. On the 8th day of the 10th month, they withdrew to Gyeongsang Province and built Ulsan Castle. Before the castle was completed, the Ming officials Yang Hao, Li Rumei, Gao Ce, Li Fangchun and others led their forces, combined with Korean troops, and came to attack. Kiyomasa, together with Asano Sakyō-dayū Yoshinaga, Ōta Hida-no-kami Kazuyoshi and others, defended with only a small force day and night. When dawn broke on the 3rd day of the 1st month of the 3rd year, allied reinforcements arrived and defeated the attacking forces, so the soldiers in the castle were miraculously saved.

Thus, since the Korean military campaigns began, troops were engaged for seven years in total. While the war achievements of our countrymen at various locations have all become distant memories, Kiyomasa alone continues to be renowned by the Ming and Koreans - sometimes celebrated in poetry and song, sometimes worshipped as a deity. His military prowess with bow and arrow has no equal in ancient or modern times.

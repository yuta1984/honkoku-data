Since he was granted this honor, he received an honorary character from the Shogun's family and was permitted the family title.
Tadasato, who held the rank of jijū (chamberlain) and junior fourth rank lower, was promoted to sangi (counselor) with junior fourth rank upper, and died on January 4th, Kan'ei 4 at the age of twenty-five. Since he had no heir, the family line was extinguished.

Jijū and Nakamusu-no-taifu Fujiwara Tadatomo was the second son of Hideyuki. In Kan'ei 3, he was made a jijū of fourth rank.

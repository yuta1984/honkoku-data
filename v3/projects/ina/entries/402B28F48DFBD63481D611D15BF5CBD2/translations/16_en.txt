"and while we try to reconcile somehow, the eastern forces will also attack. How frightening! It would not be appropriate for you alone to quarrel with the commissioners and start a war here," she said, sending him away. Then Katsutoshi left Fushimi Castle. Hideaki said, "In that case, I will enter Fushimi Castle, hold it together with the eastern forces, and await Lord Naifu," and sent a messenger to Fushimi Castle to convey this intent.

Torii Hikouemon-no-jō Mototada did not comply with this proposal, answering: "If you truly intend to serve Lord Naifu, then approach this castle together with the besieging forces. Arrange it so that people will not suspect you in any way, and you should betray them when the eastern forces attack. I will report your messenger's intent to the Kantō region." Mototada sent one of his retainers to the Kantō region with this message. [Marginal note: He sent a retainer named Iyoda Yagoemon]

Hideaki, having no other choice, sent his retainer Hiraoka Iwami-no-kami to Kuroda Kai-no-kami Nagamasa [Marginal note: Hiraoka was the nephew-in-law of Kuroda Josui-nyūdō] to report this matter to the Kantō region, and joined the besieging forces. After Fushimi Castle fell, he thought to wait in this castle for the eastern forces to attack, but the castle was completely burned down. Thus the western forces attacked down the Tōsandō, Tōkaidō, and Hokuriku routes. Hideaki was repeatedly urged to advance quickly as well. Sometimes saying he was helping wounded soldiers at Fushimi, sometimes saying he was waiting for forces rushing up from his home province, he delayed day after day.

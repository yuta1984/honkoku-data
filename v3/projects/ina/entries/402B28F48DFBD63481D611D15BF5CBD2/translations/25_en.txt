When the Toyotomi family went to the capital to have an audience with the Great Retired Shogun (Ōgosho), three men accompanied them: Jijū Terumasa (Ikeda), Higo-no-kami Kiyomasa (Katō), and Kii-no-kami Yukinaga (Asano). However, Masanori claimed illness and remained in Osaka. On May 20th of Keichō 19 (1614), Kaga Chūnagon Toshinaga died, and afterward his son Toshimitsu secretly presented to the Great Retired Shogun a letter he had obtained that had been sent from Osaka to his late father in March of that year. When this document was examined, it stated that the Toyotomi family head was already past his prime years, and that they should quickly come to Osaka to provide assistance. The military provisions currently in the castle amounted to 70,000 koku of rice, plus 30,000 koku that Masanori and others had stored at the beginning of the year, along with gold, silver, and treasures - there would be no shortage of military supplies.

Given this situation, the Shogun was troubled, knowing that civil unrest was imminent. In the ninth month of that year, the Siege of Osaka began. Masanori and others, including Katō Higo-no-kami Tadahiro, sent all the rice and grain they had in Osaka into the castle. At this time, the expansion of Edo Castle was being carried out daily, and many daimyo from the western provinces were engaged in this construction work. Masanori was likewise in the Kantō region. On October 7th, Takenaka Izu-no-kami Shigetoshi rushed from Kantō to Suruga. The Great Retired Shogun summoned Shigetoshi and said, "Since you are close friends with Masanori, go again to Kantō on my behalf and tell Masanori: This military action at Osaka was not Hideyori's true intention."

[Marginal note] If he truly thought loyally of the Toyotomi house, he should have devised schemes beforehand to ensure that house would not perish, as in the letter of remonstrance he submitted when the Osaka campaign began. ○ Masanori had a son born to the wife of his son Bingo-no-kami Masakatsu. He was called Sahyōe Masanaga. When he was born in his home province, his mother was also of low birth, so no one knew of him. When his grandfather was exiled, he secretly went up to the capital, became a monk, and took the name Jōsai. This monk's child was named Ichimatsu, and was later summoned by the Shogun.

In the first month of Keichō 19 (1614), when the Great Retired Lord crossed over to the Kantō, one of Masayori's retainers presented a sealed letter with matters to report. At the end of this month, when he returned to Sunpu in Suruga, the retainer again presented a letter at Kambara post station. In the eighth month of this year, Masayori's followers captured the retainer who had presented that letter in the town of Sunpu in Suruga Province. The town magistrate Hikosaka Kyūbei-no-jō

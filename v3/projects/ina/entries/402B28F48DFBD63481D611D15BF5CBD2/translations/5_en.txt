Chūzaburō Ujisato was at Hino Castle. When Ujisato heard of Nobunaga's death, he assembled over 500 horsemen, 50 palanquins, 100 saddled horses, and 200 pack horses, and rushed to Koshigoe that very night to present himself and request an audience. His father Yoshihide was greatly pleased and brought Oda's wife, nobles, princesses, and all the court ladies into Hino Castle for their protection. He quickly assembled military forces and devised strategies to punish the rebels. Akechi Hyūga-no-kami Mitsuhide, perceiving this situation, intended to attack Hino Castle first. However, the forces of Sanza-dono (Oda Nobutada) came up from Settsu Province, and Mitsuhide was immediately defeated. When Ujisato accompanied Kitabatake-dono to the capital, Hashiba Chikuzen-no-kami Hideyoshi was deeply moved by Ujisato's conduct during this crisis.

Hideyoshi granted him the Gamō lands that had become vacant when local lords who had sided with Akechi were destroyed (said to be worth 50 koku). When war broke out between Hashiba and Shibata, father and son sided with Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi was greatly pleased and took Yoshihide's daughter as his wife. This lady later became known as Sanjō-dono (she was Ujisato's sister). After Shibata was destroyed and Sanza-dono was killed, Hideyoshi granted Ujisato Kameyama Castle in Ise Province. At Ujisato's request, it was given to Seki Uhyōe-no-suke (because that castle was Seki's hereditary land). Ujisato was soon ennobled and appointed as Hida-no-kami. When Hideyoshi and Kitabatake-dono were at odds, Ujisato again sided with Hideyoshi and captured Kakigai Castle in Mino Province. As a reward for this achievement, he was granted Matsugashima Castle in Ise Province (his domain was doubled from 60,000 koku at Hino to 120,000 koku), and Tamaru (Nakatsukaša-shōyū), Seki (Uhyōe-no-suke), Sawa (Genroku), Akiyama (Ukon), and Katano (Kunai; the three men below Sawa were residents of Uda District in Yamato Province) were placed under Ujisato's

Kyōhō 8th year, Year of the Rabbit (1723)
1. Regarding Daizō of the Hongō representative merchant district (daimi-sekichi), on the 6th day of the 8th month of the Rabbit year, when the lord conducted an inspection of Omote Kimura-gawa, Takeda Shichirō-emon, who was serving as the monthly duty officer (go-tsukiban), summoned Daizō to the mansion on the 5th day and ordered him not to perform cleaning work at Sawatari, and furthermore ordered that Daizō of the representative merchant district should not participate. However, he disobeyed these orders by performing the cleaning work, and particularly because Daizō also participated, on the 9th day of the same month, Daizō was ordered into confinement (heimon), with his gates and windows specifically ordered to be nailed shut. He received a pardon on the 4th day of the 10th month, having been confined from the 9th day of the 8th month. Takeda Shichirō-emon served as the monthly duty officer, and we three were ordered to oversee all matters.

1. Hongō Gengorō-emon also conspired with and supported Daizō's misconduct. Because he was the nephew of the aforementioned person, he too received a pardon from the 9th day of the 8th month until the last day of the same month. For this case as well, we three were ordered to oversee petitions, consultations, and town matters. This was ordered by Takeda Shichirō-emon in his capacity as monthly duty officer.

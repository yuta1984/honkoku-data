7th month, 8th day
　　　　　　　　　　　Hongō Daizō [seal]
　　　To the Magistrate's Office

1. Regarding Hongō Daizō returning on the night of the 7th day of the 7th month, when this was reported to the South Town Magistrate's Office the following day, after investigation it was found that when he went to Edo he gave no prior notice, and moreover he had written in the name of his representative, so he was ordered into house confinement. This matter was announced to him.

　Announcement　　　Hongō Daizō

Your conduct has been consistently poor, as has been heard. This spring you went to Matsumoto and from there directly proceeded to Edo, but at that time you did not report your departure to Edo to the office, and only reported it much later, which is misconduct. Furthermore, this time your handling of the matter in Edo has been increasingly improper, which is utterly incompetent.
Therefore, the sword you have been carrying is confiscated, and the sword you have been using until now is also confiscated as previously ordered, so you must understand this.
　　Year of the Horse, 7th month, 10th day

As written above, with Takeda Shichirō-emon-sama serving as monthly duty officer and Yamagata Gozaemon-sama in attendance, on the 10th day of the 7th month at the evening hour of six (around 6 PM), Hongō Daizō was brought along and the announcement was made. Particularly regarding Daizō's sword, we were instructed to receive it and hand it over to Hongō Gengozaemon's younger brother, and we immediately handed it over to Gengozaemon's younger brother.

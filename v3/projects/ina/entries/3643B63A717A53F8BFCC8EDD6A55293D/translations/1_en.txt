Two bales of barnyard millet　Banemon

You are extremely old and have become ill, and recently suffered from a fire that spread to your property, resulting in extreme hardship. In response to your petition for relief, although it is difficult to approve such requests given the current circumstances, we will grant you barnyard millet out of special compassion. You should be grateful for this benevolence and continue to diligently perform your duties as a farmer in the same manner.

The above matter is to be communicated. End.

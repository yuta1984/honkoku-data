Certificate of Submission

Regarding the matter of stone cutters in our village, we have thoroughly investigated throughout the entire village and found that there is not a single person engaged in this occupation. Should there be any matters we failed to investigate properly, and should you learn of them later, please immediately report to us from your side. Even if any punishment is imposed upon us as a result, we will harbor no resentment whatsoever.
As proof for future reference, we affix our joint seals and submit this certificate as stated above.

We have understood each and every point of what we have been told.

Item: Regarding the protected forests of our village, we reported that until now there have been no forest guards and that the village officials have been protecting them, but due to inadequate supervision methods, this time after deliberation, we have appointed and reported forest guards for the protected forests. We have been told to protect the forests as carefully as possible, and that entry is strictly forbidden not only for gathering brushwood but even for raking fallen leaves, which we humbly acknowledge. Given this, since the protected forests have gradually become desolate until now, from this point forward we will protect them so that saplings will grow and the forests will flourish as much as possible. Even if there are trees broken or fallen by wind within the protected forests, we will promptly report them. Even village officials and forest guards must not act freely and rudely without permission. If anyone violates these rules, after investigation, not only the forest guards but also the village officials will be subject to whatever punishment may be imposed. For future reference, the village headman, group leaders, senior farmers, and forest guards jointly affix their seals and submit this document.

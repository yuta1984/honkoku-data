Written pledge submitted

Article: When the government forest was thoroughly inspected and investigated this time, fresh-cut stumps that had been recently harvested were found, and we have no excuse whatsoever for this matter discovered during the investigation. Therefore, from now on, even if hand-cuffing or fines are to be imposed, we will strictly investigate within the village and present the offenders. We humbly accept this responsibility. Once such persons are exposed, whatever punishment may be decreed, we shall harbor no resentment whatsoever. The above stated.

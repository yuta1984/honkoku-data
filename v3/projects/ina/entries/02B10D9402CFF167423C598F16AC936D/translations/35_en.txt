Needless to say, we will capture such persons and immediately report to the authorities.
If we see or hear of such activities, and during subsequent inspections new tree stumps or damage to trees large and small are found, making it difficult to provide excuses at that time, not only the mountain guard but also the village officials will be subject to whatever punishment may be decreed. We humbly acknowledge this.

Article: If there are wind-broken, fallen, or dead trees within the government forest, we will also promptly report these. Even mountain guards and village officials must not act freely in private without permission.

As stated above, we have understood each point of what has been decreed following this inspection and examination. We will strictly instruct not only all the farmers in the village but also men, women, and children not to enter the government forest. If anyone goes against what has been decreed this time and there is any negligence in the village, even if the village officials and mountain guards are subject to any punishment, we will not harbor any resentment at that time. For future reference, the village headman, group leaders, senior farmers, and mountain guards affix their seals. Therefore, as stated.

Item: Regarding the six protected forest areas in our village (Tenjin Forest, Ōbayashi, Yamanokami Forest, Yato Forest, Kita Forest, and Ōiri), we have guided [the inspectors] to all locations without omission, and there are no discrepancies. Should you hear that we provided guidance with discrepancies, please impose whatever punishment you see fit.

Item: Not to mention the content of the official notice boards for the protected forests that were posted in the past, we have understood each and every point of the instructions given after this inspection tour and examination, and we humbly consider them most reasonable. Therefore, regarding the matter of the protected forests, not only the mountain guardians but also the village headman and group leaders shall take great care and diligently protect them.

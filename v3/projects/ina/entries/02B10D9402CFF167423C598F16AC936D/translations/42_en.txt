although there is no such designation, there is absolutely no confusion within the temple grounds. If there should be any complainant from outside claiming that this is not temple forest land, whatever punishment will be imposed. We do not report anything false. Furthermore, regarding our private forests in the area below the lord's forest, as we have submitted with our names and seals, there is absolutely no discrepancy. If you should hear of any discrepancy, regardless of whose property it may be, it will be confiscated and taken up as part of the lord's forest at any time. At that time, not only the landowners but even village officials must not utter a single word of objection. On the contrary, punishment for such offense will be imposed accordingly. For future reference, this is a sworn document with the seals of the village head, group heads, and private forest owners, therefore as stated above.

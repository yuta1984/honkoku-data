We had neglected to give proper instructions to the bamboo grove keepers, leaving them unattended. As a result, the bamboo grove keepers have been negligent, and the bamboo groves have failed to produce good bamboo, becoming like mere bamboo grass thickets, just as you suspected. There is nothing we can say in our defense. When spring comes, we will use village laborers to clear away grove trees, dead bamboo, bamboo grass, undergrowth, etc., and will diligently tend to the groves so that good bamboo shoots will grow.

Item: If there are snow-broken bamboo, standing dead bamboo, etc. within the bamboo groves, we will report to the authorities. Not only the bamboo grove keepers, but even village officials shall not act arbitrarily in private without permission.

As stated above, we have understood each and every instruction given during this inspection tour. From now on, we will carefully protect the groves and endeavor to grow good bamboo. Furthermore, we will convey the instructions given this time to all the villagers, including men, women, and children, and will take special care during bamboo shoot season. For future reference, the village headman, group heads, senior farmers, and bamboo grove keepers affix their seals hereto.

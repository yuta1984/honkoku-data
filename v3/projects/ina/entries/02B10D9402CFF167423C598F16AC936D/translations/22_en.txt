It was promised that the matter would be clearly pardoned privately, but again during this inspection round, [he] falsely claimed that location as his own property, and moreover cut down six or seven large trees, fifteen planks, eight round logs, and one pillar that had been cut and left there. When this was observed and investigated through detailed examination and inquiry, [we] were troubled by the false claims made and apologize for the error. There is no excuse whatsoever. For future reference, respectfully submitted.

Honkuramura Village
Sozaemon

The aforementioned Sozaemon falsely claimed the government forest boundary and moreover cut down large pine trees. After investigation and detailed inquiry, this was extremely improper conduct, and we have nothing to say in defense. Therefore, until the inquiry is completed, [he] has been placed in the custody of the village officials, which we humbly acknowledge.

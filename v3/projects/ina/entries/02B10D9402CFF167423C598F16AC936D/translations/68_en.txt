Written Pledge Submitted

Item: This time, for the inspection of the government forest, you made your rounds and we guided you through one tan eighteen bu of our village's Taki-no-iri government forest according to the land registry, and there was no confusion. Under these circumstances, we will strictly observe the government notice boards as instructed from long ago, with even greater care and diligence. Now that forest guards have been appointed for the government forest, not only cutting brushwood but even taking tree leaves or anything else from within the government forest is strictly forbidden. If it should later come to your attention that we overlooked or ignored anyone entering without permission, not only the mountain guard but also the village headman and group leaders accept that any punishment may be imposed upon us. This pledge serves as testimony for future reference. Thus as stated.

we humbly understand.
Article 1: Regarding one bamboo grove, we also guided you to inspect it, and when you examined it, the village officials had neglected their supervision for several years and had left it unattended without assigning grove guards, causing it to become overgrown. We have no excuse for the suspicious matters revealed in your investigation. From now on, we shall maintain it properly, construct solid fences on all four sides, restore the bamboo, and during the bamboo shoot season, we shall be even more diligent. Not only shall we refrain from cutting bamboo, but we shall also ensure that no one enters to harvest bamboo shoots, being extremely careful in this regard. We shall take care that it becomes a good bamboo grove within a year or two. No one shall enter the lord's bamboo grove even to discard bamboo husks.

As stated above, since you have investigated both the lord's forest and bamboo grove on this occasion and given us your instructions, we shall protect them with utmost care. Even when there are trees broken by wind or fallen, or bamboo broken by snow within the lord's forest and bamboo grove, we shall immediately report it to you. Not only village officials, but even mountain guards and grove guards shall not act freely without instructions. For future reference, the village headman, group leaders, senior farmers, mountain guards, and grove guards affix their seals to this document as witnessed.

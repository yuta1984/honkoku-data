We humbly acknowledge and accept these matters.

Article: Even if there are wind-fallen trees, fallen timber, or snow-broken bamboo within the forest groves and bamboo thickets, neither the mountain guards nor thicket guards, nor even village officials, shall take any unauthorized action in private without permission. Regarding the bamboo thickets, if it becomes possible by next spring, we shall construct fences on all four sides and guard the bamboo shoots with even greater care during the bamboo shoot season.

As stated above, we have understood each and every point of the instructions given to us following this inspection and examination. Regarding the forest thickets, not only brush cutting but also leaf gathering, and within the bamboo thickets, not only bamboo cutting and grass cutting but even collecting bamboo bark is strictly prohibited. We shall strictly instruct everyone in the village, including men, women, and children, in these matters and guard them with utmost care. Should even one person claim ignorance and enter the bamboo thickets to commit offenses, please impose whatever punishment you deem appropriate on not only the mountain guards and thicket guards but also the village officials after proper investigation.

Item: Regarding the Kannon protected forest (gohayashi) in our village, measuring 4 tan 6 se 20 bu, with boundaries to the east at Komono-no-sawa-arashi ravine, the bank at one ridge road, and to the west at Jinzaemon's allocated portion - we reported and guided you that this area constitutes the protected forest, and there is no confusion about this. However, after your inspection and consideration of the area measurement, your suspicion regarding the unclear western boundary from the ancient trees' silver markers or the location of the prohibition sign to the temple is quite reasonable, and we humbly accept this concern. 

Accordingly, until the property divisions of the five individuals - Jinzaemon, Rihei, Kyūzaemon, Shirobei, and Jiroemon - up to the prohibition sign location are properly established, we understand and humbly accept that this area should be designated as protected forest. Under these circumstances, we will petition again, and until the divisions are properly established, the farmers who claim ownership will serve as forest guardians, and we understand and accept that we must carefully protect the area according to the prohibition signs and regulations. This document serves as proof for future reference.

The young trees and saplings of the lord's forest did not grow properly, and we have no excuse for the suspicious matters revealed in your investigation.

For this we are so grateful that we cannot adequately express our appreciation. Therefore, regarding the new lord's forest, not only the mountain guards but the entire village shall carefully tend it so that pines and miscellaneous trees may grow thick and flourish. Should there naturally be any tree stumps, not limited to pines and miscellaneous trees, the village officials and mountain guards shall be strictly investigated, as we humbly understand.

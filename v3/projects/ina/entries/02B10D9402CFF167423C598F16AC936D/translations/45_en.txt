Document submitted as testimony:

Regarding the lord's forest called "Otai Kubo" by the riverside in our village: the southern boundary runs from the field edge (kiriba), the eastern boundary follows the Shibayama path, the northern boundary follows the one-dō path, and the area within the pine groves constitutes the lord's forest. Additionally, within the mixed woodland areas, from below the side road to the northern one path, and on the south side, both pine and mixed trees extending toward the sunny southern slope up to the field edge - all of this is indisputably the lord's forest.

However, regarding our initial report that three-tenths of the land from the southern field edge to the eastern Shibayama mountain boundary had taxable field status, we have no evidence to support this claim, so we humbly acknowledge that your suspicions are entirely justified.

Given this situation, we have no excuse for the designation of the area from the field edge to the one-dō path as lord's forest.

Furthermore, regarding Gengoemon's holdings, there is no discrepancy in our statement that the area below the side road constitutes lord's forest, while the area from the road up to the one-dō path is private forest. Should we make any contradictory statements and you hear of this in the future, please conduct a thorough investigation and impose whatever punishment you deem appropriate. For future reference, this document bears the seals of the village head, group heads, senior farmers, forest guardians, and landowners, as stated herein.

I have this time received permission to return to my domain.
As I have no male heir,
should any unforeseen circumstances
occur while I am staying in my domain, I request that Naito Tomegoro,
the younger brother of Naito Jinjuro of the Suganuma Iga-no-kami unit 
of the Pages (Okosho-gumi), who is currently twelve years old in this year of the Rabbit,
though not a blood relative,
shares the same family name, be appointed as my
adopted son and granted succession rights.

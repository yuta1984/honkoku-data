I have received permission to return to my domain, 
and as I have no male heir,
should any unforeseen circumstances
occur while I am residing in my domain, I request that
Naitō Tomegoro, younger brother of Naitō Jinjūrō
of the Takagi Chikugo-no-kami group of the Pages (Gokoshōgumi), who is
currently ten years old in this year of the Ox, though not a blood relative,
shares the same family name, and I humbly request that
this person be appointed as my adopted son and
granted succession rights. The above.

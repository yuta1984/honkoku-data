Document Submitted Respectfully

Regarding the stone cutters in our village, we have investigated all persons in the village without exception and submitted our report. There are no other persons besides those listed. Furthermore, when they go on trips for stone cutting work, they do not employ stone cutting apprentices at their destinations. We have instructed them in detail to observe the actual conditions at their travel destinations and report back, and they have understood and accepted these instructions completely. Should there be any matters that were inadequately investigated and come to your attention later, please notify us immediately from your office. Even if any punishment should be imposed upon us thereafter, we harbor no resentment whatsoever. This joint sealed document is prepared for future reference. Thus recorded.

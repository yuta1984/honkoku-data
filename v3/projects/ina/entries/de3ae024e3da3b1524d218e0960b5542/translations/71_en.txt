One - Concerning the incident that occurred throughout the domain in the previous Year of the Horse,
As it involved matters related to the domain's reputation,
At that time control measures were put in place, and subsequently
Gradually
Benevolent governance was implemented. Now, regretting
Past wrongs and being deeply ashamed,
Having tarnished the domain's reputation, and wishing
To repay the benevolent favor, as an act of devotion, the seven
Districts together with the townspeople wish to unite and
Make a monetary offering, such being our earnest desire

Now that this judgment has been rendered, from now on, everyone should take this to heart. If there are any suspicious persons, not only the officials but also relatives and neighborhood associations should be well informed and conduct thorough investigations before reporting. If matters are neglected and come to attention from outside sources, after investigation, severe punishments will be imposed. Ultimately, because the officials have been negligent and troublesome matters for the authorities occur year after year without any improvement, from now on the officials should coordinate at the office and strictly observe the prohibitions of the authorities. A fine of up to three bu should be paid.

This judgment should be announced with all parties present. The above.

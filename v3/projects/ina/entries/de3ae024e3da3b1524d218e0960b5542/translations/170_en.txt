Regarding these individuals: During spring, there was a matter of bidding disputes within the town district, and while their departure from town was restricted, they engaged in business elsewhere. When it became unavoidable for them to travel, they should have submitted proper inquiries to the authorities for instructions, but they failed to follow such procedures. Furthermore, they traveled to distant provinces and were away for an excessive number of days, which constitutes a grave breach of duty. Under these circumstances, it would be difficult for them to maintain their social standing without undergoing strict examination. Particularly regarding Tomouemon, who holds an old office position, it would be difficult to handle his case in an ordinary manner. However, since the town district matter has been resolved and there is no need for special investigation, both individuals are sentenced to house confinement (oshikomi). They must conduct themselves with utmost discretion.
The above directive shall be communicated. End.

1. From the government office, as follows:
　Regarding the use of old gold and silver coins, which was
　announced in the 2nd month of this year, in the coming Year of the Boar

[Left page]

From the 2nd month, their use will be completely prohibited.
After the prohibition, their use is strictly
forbidden.

1. Regarding old nishu coins, their
　use will also soon be
　prohibited by official decree. Therefore, those who possess old nishu coins
　should make every effort during this period to bring them to exchange offices
　and apply for exchange.

1. Even after the prohibition of old gold and silver coins
　goes into effect, there may still be old gold and silver coins
　remaining unexchanged in distant provinces and other places due to unavoidable
　circumstances. Therefore, regarding exchange offices,
　while old nishu coins are still in circulation, we will first
　continue to maintain them as before. Those who
　possess old gold and silver coins should promptly bring
　them forward and apply for exchange. If anyone uses old gold and silver coins after the prohibition
　or hoards old gold and silver coins
　without exchanging them, they will be investigated
　and severely punished.

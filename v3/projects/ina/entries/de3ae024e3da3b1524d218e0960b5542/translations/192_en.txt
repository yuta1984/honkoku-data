On the night of the 12th day of the 8th month last year, at Jōkoku-ji temple in Iwatsuki, Musashi Province, the former head priest Hyōkai
and novice monk Jō conspired with accomplices
and committed murder before fleeing. A wanted poster for the said Hyōkai's
servant Hakuma Umekichi was
circulated in the 11th month of the same year, but he has still
not been found. Continue searching vigilantly, and if anyone matching
the description in the wanted poster that was previously
circulated is found, detain them on the spot and report to
Lord Doi Ōi-no-kami.

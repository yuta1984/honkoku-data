Regarding the two-bu gold coins, it has been heard that their
circulation in the world is insufficient, so at this time
an increase in minting has been ordered. However, until now
the two-bu coins bore the Kinza mint mark
with the character "bun" (文) written in standard script, but from this time forward
like the koban one-bu coins, it will be changed to
cursive script.
Please understand this point, and the previous two-bu coins
should be accepted without discrimination for circulation
without any hindrance.
The above matter should be communicated.

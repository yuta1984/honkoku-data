Regarding the cessation of circulation
of old gold and silver ni-shu coins,
even after the cessation, in distant provinces and elsewhere
there remain unavoidable exchanges to be made,
therefore exchange offices
have been established until this Ushi year, twelfth month.
This was previously announced, however there are still
remaining gold and silver ni-shu coins to be exchanged,
and moreover, in the current seventh month, the matter of
ni-bu coin exchange was also announced.
Therefore, regarding exchanges, once again
until next Tora year, tenth month, the arrangements
will continue as before. Accordingly, those possessing
old gold and silver ni-shu coins, as well as
ni-bu coins with authentic
characters, should promptly submit them for exchange.

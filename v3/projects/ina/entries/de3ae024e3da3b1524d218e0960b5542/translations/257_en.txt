Bunsei 13, Year of the Metal Tiger (1830)
　　　　 New Year's Auspicious Day

Regarding the matter of the Christian sect, although it has been prohibited by governmental decree since long ago, this time in the Kamigata region there were those who practiced heretical acts as followers of said sect, and they have been sentenced to severe punishment. Therefore, regarding the matter of said sect, investigation shall be carried out even more thoroughly. Each person must vigilantly examine [suspects] without negligence, and if there are any suspicious persons, they must report them promptly to the appropriate authorities. Depending on the case, rewards will be granted, and it will be ordered that no revenge be taken against the informant. However, if anyone hears or sees [such activities] but conceals them, and they are later discovered from other sources, even the people of that place will be subject to criminal punishment.
The above matter must be thoroughly communicated to all directions.

Regarding the matter of hairdressers in this town, there have been no established regulations until now, and each individual has been conducting business as they pleased. However, since there are now those who wish to apply internally, after examination, it has been decided that henceforth this shall be organized as a licensed trade guild (kabu-mono). Those who wish to engage in this trade must have their character investigated, and in the case of outsiders, they must provide guarantors and submit applications through the proper channels. Furthermore,
government prohibitions go without saying, and in general, negligent behavior must be avoided, and affairs must be managed without causing trouble in the town. Details will be communicated at the tax office, so understand this intent and pay careful attention to all matters, conducting business through proper methods.
The above matter shall be communicated to the town officials.

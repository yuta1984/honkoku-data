In recent years, due to the state of the world, the wages of day laborers have become expensive. Regarding day laborers employed by various government offices, we have heard that there are difficulties in paying the wages that were announced in previous years. Therefore, this time we have appointed Kobayashi Tōzaemon, who has been sent to the town, to handle day labor matters. As his subordinates, we have appointed Zensaemon of Hokoji Village and Ushimatsu of Fukuro-machi as day labor supervisors. Once Tōzaemon and his subordinates make their announcements, all sectors should ensure there are no problems with day laborers. Henceforth, those who wish to begin day labor work must go to Tōzaemon's place, receive detailed instructions, and perform their duties without delay. Should there be anyone who misunderstands their duties, Tōzaemon's office will negotiate with the officials of that area, so this should be kept in mind beforehand and communicated without omission down to the lowest-ranking people.

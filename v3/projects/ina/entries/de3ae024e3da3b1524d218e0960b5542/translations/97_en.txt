3rd month, 5th day of the Year of the Dog
1. An official document was issued from the government office, 
  as follows:

Regarding the circulation of old gold and silver coins, we issued an order in the 7th month of last year (Year of the Rooster) that their use should be discontinued from the 3rd month of this year. However, as there are still exchange coins remaining, and considering that in remote regions and overseas routes there may be places where transportation is inconvenient and exchanges may still remain incomplete, we will continue to allow the circulation of old gold and silver coins as before until the 1st month of the coming Year of the Boar, and discontinue it from the 2nd month. As has been repeatedly announced, in government territories the magistrates, and in private domains the lords and local administrators, should provide even more careful assistance and have [people] bring [old coins] to the nearest exchange locations to complete all exchanges by the 1st month of the coming Year of the Boar. If there are still those who

hoard old gold and silver coins without exchanging them, this should be reported immediately, and after investigation, strict orders shall be given.

Document of Submission

Regarding the matter of stone cutters in our village, we have thoroughly investigated and found that there are no persons other than those listed in this year's registry. We acknowledge that stone cutters working in distant places should conduct themselves with complete integrity and in a proper manner. Should you hear that we have excluded and concealed anyone from the official records, we understand that you should report this to the authorities. No matter what punishment we humble persons might receive, we shall harbor no resentment whatsoever. This serves as a certificate of responsibility for stone cutters for future reference. Thus as stated.

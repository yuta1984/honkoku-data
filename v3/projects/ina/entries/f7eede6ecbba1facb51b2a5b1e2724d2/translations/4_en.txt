Respectful Memorial Record

Item: Six pack loads of oil cake, bound for Dennzaemon of Nikenya in Iida town, shipped from Takato. Cargo owner: Bunemeon of Man'ya, Kozō of Tomiya. Of these six loads, three loads were entrusted to Yasōji of Hikage village and three loads to Hachirōji of Ōshima village, both pack horse operators. When they attempted transport, Iijima village imposed a seizure. Despite repeated negotiations, they would not listen to our appeals at all, so we had to leave the goods in storage and return. Subsequently, the cargo owner went to Iijima village to negotiate, whereupon they stated that the goods would be transported only as far as Ichida village and held there. With such obstacles as described above, we face extreme hardship going forward. With your compassion, if you would issue orders according to previous customs, we would consider it a most grateful blessing. The above.

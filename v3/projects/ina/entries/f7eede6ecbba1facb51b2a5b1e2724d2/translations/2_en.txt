We sell them and use the proceeds to procure goods needed locally, which then become return cargo for the pack horses - this has been our established practice from long ago. Not only for round trips to Iida, but also to Owari and Mikawa provinces, there had been no obstacles whatsoever. 【Pasted note】"However," since the spring of the year of the Tiger two years ago (spring of Meiwa 7/1770), within the post station villages along the route from the Iida area of our district to our locality, various troublesome objections have been raised, creating obstacles. Consequently, the pack horse operators naturally refuse to undertake cargo transport, making passage impossible. Not only our town but even the rural areas are experiencing great hardship.

Particularly on this occasion, when we attempted to send out goods, Iijima village imposed a seizure order. Despite the pack horse operators' various negotiations in response, they would not listen to our pleas at all, and we had no choice but to leave our goods in storage. If things continue to be delayed in this manner, we will be completely unable to conduct our domain's business in the future, and we have no means to continue our trade. We are in an utterly desperate situation, facing extreme hardship.

Though it may be presumptuous, we humbly request your wise consideration of this matter, and that you permit the transport of goods for round-trip commerce by pack horses as was done previously.

We humbly petition that you graciously hear this appeal and issue orders as we have requested...

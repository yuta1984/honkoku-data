Military Law Discussion

When I created the system of gun formations and taught it to my disciples who were engaged in learning, one of them asked: "We have already heard and understood the detailed provisions of the gun formation system. May I dare ask what it means that military affairs originate from the musical pitch pipes (ritsu)?" I replied: "The pitch pipes are the foundation of all things. They are the laws and regulations that military affairs follow. The names of the twelve pitch pipes (ritsu-ryo), the generation of pitch pipes through the three-part loss-and-gain method, what is called 'the ritsu takes a wife and the ryo bears children' - these are recorded in the musical treatises of successive dynasties and need not be discussed in detail. This system is exclusively connected to musical tones. When a ruler undertakes military campaigns, he must clearly correspond to the pitch pipe of the month - if the sounds are harmonious, then he attacks; if they are not harmonious, then he does not attack. This is how a ruler receives the moral instruction through music for his entire reign."

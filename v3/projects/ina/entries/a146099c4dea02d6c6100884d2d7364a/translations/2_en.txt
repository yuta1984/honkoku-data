Taking advantage of this opportunity to send word, I write to you briefly. With the season turning cold, I trust that you and all your family members are in good health, which brings me great joy.
I am also doing well, so please do not worry about me.
Now, regarding Koshimaki's father, I spend my days worrying about him.
Also, I gratefully received the message from Nakazō-dono. Please give my regards regarding this matter. Furthermore, I have taken on a great deal of work and am very busy, making it difficult for me to return home. I hope you will understand this situation. I earnestly request that both Gisuke-dono and Yoshiya come quickly.
Written late at night, please forgive my poor handwriting. With all due respect, I humbly submit this letter.

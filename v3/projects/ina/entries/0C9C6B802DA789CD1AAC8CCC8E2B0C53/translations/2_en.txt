Recommendation Report to be Submitted to the Goyōnin (Chief Retainer) of His Excellency the Udaishō's Goshoin-ban

Under the supervision of Ōshima Kai-no-kami:
Mizutani Kuranosuke
Sasamoto Hikotarō
Ōno Tōzaburō

These three men are of honest and upright character, work diligently, manage household affairs well, attend meetings and appointed duties without negligence, and are particularly devoted to various arts and skills. I believe they are all men who can achieve distinguished service. Therefore, I submit this report to the aforementioned goyōnin.

Regarding Kuranosuke among the above: both his great-grandfather Yanosuke and grandfather Yanosuke served faithfully in inner palace service for many years. His father Tsurugoro, though living as a dependent son, died of illness. Since these two ancestors performed excellent service but their merit has not been properly rewarded, the current Kuranosuke earnestly wishes to undergo examination and selection. If possible, I would like Kuranosuke to be recognized on this occasion, and I humbly beseech your benevolence in this matter.

The above respectfully submitted,
12th month of the Year of the Rat　　　　Ōshima Kai-no-kami

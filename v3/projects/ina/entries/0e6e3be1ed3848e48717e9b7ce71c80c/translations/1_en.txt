A Pledge Document Submitted

Item: Regarding the stone cutters in our village, we have investigated throughout the village and reported, and there are no others besides these. Furthermore, when going out to work as stone cutters in distant places, they will not hire stone cutting apprentices. We have instructed them in detail to work diligently and honestly at their destinations, and they have acknowledged each point. Should there be any negligent matters beyond this that come to your attention later, please report immediately from your end. Even if any punishment is imposed upon us, we will harbor no resentment whatsoever. This joint seal document is for future reference, therefore as stated above.

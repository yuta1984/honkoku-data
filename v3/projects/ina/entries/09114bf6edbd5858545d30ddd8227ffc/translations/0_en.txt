Document of Annual Installment Loan

One item: Forty-five ryō in gold

Regarding this amount: During the seventh month of this year, when Hori Tenzen-sama, who serves under Ōinomikado-sama, stayed in our locality, there was no payment whatsoever for the lodging fees at the inns, causing great hardship to the innkeepers. Therefore, we humbly requested a loan, which was graciously approved. Through your benevolence, we have been ordered to repay this amount over ten annual installments from the coming Year of the Rabbit to the Year of the Rat. We are deeply grateful for this most fortunate arrangement. We will without fail make the repayments as ordered. Therefore, we submit this loan certificate.

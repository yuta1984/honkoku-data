   　Note: During the outer dismounting period, and since there was no service at the Western Palace, Lord Matsudaira Noto
   　served, then returning, Lords Uemura Suruga, Mizuno Iki,
   　and Aoyama Shimotsuke served, then returning again, Lords Matsudaira Ukyo and
   　Kyogoku Suo served, after which they served in the usual sequential order

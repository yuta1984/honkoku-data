The 23rd day of the same month
1. As representative of my kinsman Harima-no-kami, I wore bleached hemp half-formal attire and
   departed home at 5:30 to enter the castle
1. I had already sent word through the monks to the inspector that I would appear as a representative
1. Since Naito Miki was also present, I met with him and exchanged appropriate greetings,
   then discussed arrangements for the seats where the announcement would later be made
1. When the senior councillors entered the castle, all those on duty that day came to their seats
1. Soon an inspector approached, so timing it for around the inspection rounds, I took my seat
   at the end as shown in the diagram
1. The senior councillors entered the Nami-no-ma (Wave Room) and the inspector gave his acknowledgment, whereupon
   both myself and Miki came forward together. Regarding my kinsman Harima-no-kami's illness, as petitioned, his retirement was
   granted, and the family headship was without question bestowed upon his adopted son Miki, as announced by
   the duty officer Matsudaira Ukyo-no-taiyu-dono. I respectfully acknowledged this
   fortunate outcome and withdrew from my seat
1. Then I also greeted Miki and proceeded to the Sotetsu-no-ma (Cycad Room)
   where I fully informed his caretaker of the details of what had been announced
1. Then I immediately left the castle, completed my rounds of duty among senior and junior officials, and at the gate of Lord Hotta Settsu-no-kami's residence
   where my kinsman Miki's caretaker was waiting, I conveyed the verbal message and
   returned home at 9:30

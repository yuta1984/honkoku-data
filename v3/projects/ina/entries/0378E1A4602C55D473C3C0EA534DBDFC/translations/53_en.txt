November 1st
1. To formally express gratitude for Itakura Hyakusuke's succession to family headship, I served as his representative, wearing noshime long kamishimo, and entered the castle around 6 AM.

1. While waiting in the usual waiting room, the monks' quarters conveyed a message from the metsuke about rehearsal, so I immediately proceeded to the vicinity of the Sakura-no-ma of the Goshiro-shoin. Matsudaira Bizen-no-kami was also there to express gratitude for his sankin attendance, and since he was seated above me, we completed the rehearsal in order.
   However, since I was serving as a representative,
   there would be no direct audience with the lord, only the formal announcement

1. After that, when the rōjū (senior councilors) arrived at the castle, I went to my seat. When the metsuke sent word, I immediately proceeded to the main corridor. From there, I appeared before his lordship and completed the representative's formal thanks without incident. In the Nakanokuchi corridor, I met with Itakura Hyakusuke's caretaker, informed him that the formal thanks had been completed successfully, and immediately withdrew.

1. Today was the monthly day for visiting the West Castle, but following precedent, I did not serve in my capacity as representative. However, I made sure to inform Ōmetsuke Asahina Kawachi-no-kami of this matter as a precaution.

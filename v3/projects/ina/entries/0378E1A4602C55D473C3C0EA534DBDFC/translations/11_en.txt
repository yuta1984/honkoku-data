　　Regarding myself, as Tango-no-kami had petitioned, the adoption has been
　　approved, the inherited domain has been granted without change, and appointment to Gan-no-ma-zume
　　has been announced to my representative Naitō Suruga-no-kami,
　　which I consider a most grateful occasion. I express gratitude for the above through my representative

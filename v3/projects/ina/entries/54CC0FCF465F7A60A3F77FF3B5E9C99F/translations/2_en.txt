Those living above their station shall be subject to mandatory rice loans for seven years starting from the spring of this year, with uniform application and rates determined as specified in the attached document. Those who have been exempted from rice loans until now, as well as those with small stipends residing in Edo, have been given consideration and exempted until now, but this time they will also be subject to rice loans for a fixed number of years. This is truly unavoidable, and while the hardships to be endured go without saying, maintaining one's household by any means necessary constitutes the highest form of loyal service. All retainers, regardless of rank, should understand that the simplification of their private lifestyle depends on each person's resolve. One must not drift toward luxurious customs based on mutual circumstances and personal sentiment.

Article 1: For senior councilors and others without office, as well as those serving as officials with small stipends, appropriate allowances shall be ordered according to their circumstances after deliberation, while repeat loans are in effect.

Unseemly aspects should naturally be avoided.

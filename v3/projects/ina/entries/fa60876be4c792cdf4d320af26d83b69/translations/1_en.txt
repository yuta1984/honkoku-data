Regarding the matter of submitting this written pledge:

Item 1: Concerning the detailed records of stonemasons who travel to other provinces for seasonal work, we will carefully examine and count the number of people, and all will jointly submit their names. Naturally, we will ensure that annual tributes and official duties are fulfilled without delay.

As for the prohibitions issued by the Shogunate, it goes without saying that we shall never act contrary to the official ordinances that have been consistently decreed. We have been instructed to strictly observe these points.

On the sixth day of the second month of Kyōhō 10 (year of the Snake), under the supervision of magistrates Yamagata Gozaemon and Takeda Shichirōemon, we received verbal instructions regarding financial remittances. Due to our lord's current financial difficulties, we were instructed that if we provide the sum of 8,000 ryō—5,000 ryō for Edo and 3,000 ryō for the domain's expenses—we would receive 11,000 koku of rice in return. We were also instructed that the authorities would provide a written list of personnel names. Accordingly, we returned to consult among ourselves and agreed to provide our response at a later time.

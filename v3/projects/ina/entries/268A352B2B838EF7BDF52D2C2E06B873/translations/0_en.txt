Furthermore, the Shogun continues to be in good health and is eating well, so please be at ease. We are pleased to hear that all is well on your end as well. Since there are no particular matters to report, I will not go into details. The above.

I have received and read your two letters from the 7th and 9th. His Lordship the Shogun is in increasingly good health and is eating well, so please rest assured. Yesterday, the 17th, he visited the shrine at Momijiyama and returned in good spirits. All is well on your end, and we are told that the Imperial Court and retired emperor's court are also safe,

which is truly a matter for humble celebration. We are also pleased to hear that you yourself are well and carrying out your duties without incident. All of us here are also in good health. The above.

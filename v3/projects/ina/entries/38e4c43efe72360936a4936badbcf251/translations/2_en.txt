A preliminary notice issued by the surveying office from Ikeda in Harima Province was relayed from Inabe Village on the night of the 27th day of the 3rd month. A copy was immediately made and transmitted in sequence to Kurita Village, and a written copy was submitted to the government office.

However, since this preliminary notice mentioned dispatching surveyors from Iida via the Ina Highway to Kofu in Kai Province, orders were given to retrieve it from Dogakigai Village, relay it back to Inabe Village, and then transmit it in sequence to Tono Village. This too was promptly relayed back.

When this preliminary notice was submitted to the government office, after making inquiries, it was decided to depart on the 1st day of the 4th month. Consultations were made with Jubei, the town representative of Shimizu-cho, and Kokichi of Shodaya in Naka-machi regarding various matters up to the Sanshu area, and discussions were held about protocols for village visits.

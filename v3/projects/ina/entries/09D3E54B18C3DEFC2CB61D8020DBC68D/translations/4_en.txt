　　　We humbly petition you with this written document
From Komaichi, village elder of Mikoshiba Village in Ina County, Shinshū Province, and one other person, a petition was submitted requesting to operate navigation throughout the Tenryū River from Lake Suwa to Kaketsuka in Tōtōmi Province for the benefit of the nation. Consequently, Tatsuno Village and twenty-nine other villages in the same county were subjected to examination. We stated that if new navigation were to be established, it would not only affect the cultivation of village rice fields and other crops but would also obstruct our traditional cargo transport and nakauma pack-horse operations, causing us extreme hardship. Both parties were graciously informed of your understanding, for which we are deeply grateful. Therefore, we petition for a postponement, and after discussions, we have reached the following agreements:

1. Regarding the petition for navigation on the Tenryū River from Lake Suwa to Kaketsuka port in Tōtōmi Province, since there are several locations along the river requiring flood control construction work, there shall be absolutely no obstruction [to such work].

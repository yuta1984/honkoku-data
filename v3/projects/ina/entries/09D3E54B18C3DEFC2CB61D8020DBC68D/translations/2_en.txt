During periods of drought, we cut branches and leaves of bamboo and trees, and use stones and earth-filled straw bags to ensure not a single drop
　leaks, damming the water completely to draw irrigation water at these locations.
　Furthermore, regarding the weir sites, even after completing rice seedbed preparation, rice planting,
　field weeding, and harvest, we do not dismantle the weirs
　but leave them in place. The reason we leave the weir sites intact is that if we were to dismantle them at that time,
　the ground would become uneven, making it difficult to construct dams the following year. There-
　fore, we have continued to leave them in place. If river navigation were to commence, this would cause extreme difficulties.

1. The aforementioned river has several official flood control construction sites, and during navigation,
　large stakes, barrier stakes, and wicker baskets would naturally become obstacles, and if these were removed
　to allow passage, the flood control works would not hold, resulting in river bank collapses and gaps that would cause stones and sand to flow into the rice fields and farmland,
　which is an immediate concern. Particularly when towing boats
　along the river, the trampling of rice fields and hay meadows on both banks of the river
　is an obvious problem that would cause us serious difficulties.

1. Regarding this river, there are many high mountain valleys, and even with slight thunderstorms,
　it quickly floods and the river channels change suddenly. If navigation were established
　and annual tax rice were to be transported downstream in the future, when river routes
　are in poor condition and sudden road repairs requiring laborers are ordered,
　the villages with small populations would face unprecedented corvée labor burdens, leading to even greater impov-
　erishment and extreme hardship. Moreover, since both sides of the Tenryu River consist of rice fields and
　hay meadows, we have constructed several earthen bridges, allowing villages free
　passage. However, if these were removed for navigation purposes, it would cause significant inconvenience
　and extreme difficulties.

1. Regarding our villages, since they are located in remote mountainous areas, we rely solely on agriculture

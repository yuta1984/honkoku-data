There was a gracious command, and again when I turned my face only toward the duty officer,
there was acknowledgment of my gratitude for receiving the gracious command. I turned to the right, withdrew from my seat, and at the bamboo room verandah,
put on my short sword and withdrew as initially. Since I had previously arranged for one inner monk to accompany me,
I proceeded with him to around the timekeeper's quarters, at this point went out to the middle room,
withdrew from the wainscoting room to the yamabuki room, went to the seat and announced to the attendants of the day, then
immediately departed. I ascended to the Western Compound, and as usual in the wild goose
room, I had an audience with the master of ceremonies Honda Bungo-no-kami, expressed my gratitude and departed. From there,
I expressed my gratitude to the senior councilors and junior councilors of the Western Compound and returned home after nine o'clock.
1. Upon returning home, I gave direct
　replies to the messenger from deputy Oki-no-kami as well as messengers from close relatives.
1. To my colleagues of the current service, regarding my return to the capital
　audience and receiving the gracious command, and concerning this, I sent out an introductory circular stating that I would serve as
　assistant and assistant sword-bearer on duty days.
1. After eight o'clock, through a messenger from Lord Abe Bitchū-no-kami, regarding the return of
　the temporary succession petition I had submitted before departing from Nikkō. The steward went out to receive it, appeared in the small □ hall,
　called out the messenger, and I sent a direct reply stating that I humbly received the return of the temporary adoption petition
　and acknowledged its receipt.
　　However, I immediately sent a caretaker messenger to Lord Bitchū-no-kami as a reply.

　　　　Same day, the 25th
1. For expressing gratitude for performing the return audience
　and subsequently receiving the gracious command, I departed the residence after seven o'clock wearing formal hakama,
　and visited Lord Abe Bitchū-no-kami, the duty officer, as a caller. The public steward called me, and I stated that I had come to express gratitude for the return
　audience and waited. Soon the public steward opened
　the cedar sliding doors of the reception room. Taking my fan at the entrance, I announced my name, stating that I had performed the return
　audience and
　expressing my gratitude for receiving the gracious command, then withdrew from my seat. I went to the side room and waited, and soon Lord Bitchū appeared,
　exchanging greetings about good health. At the reception area, as host at the entrance,
　he took in the fan, I made my announcement and departed. From there, I went to visit
　Lord Matsudaira Noto-no-kami of the Western Compound senior councilors, but since he was no longer receiving callers, I left word with his public steward about gratitude for the return
　audience and the gracious command, and returned home before five o'clock.
　　However, I had arranged through the caretaker the previous evening to meet with
　　Lords Bitchū-no-kami and Noto-no-kami.

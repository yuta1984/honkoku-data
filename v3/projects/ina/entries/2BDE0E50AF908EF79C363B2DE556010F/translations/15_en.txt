I stated my gratitude and withdrew, passed through the waiting room, exchanged greetings with the executive head and caretaker, and returned home. There was an escort as when I arrived, and I put on my sword in the lower reception room before departing.

1. From there I proceeded to the main shrine. I dismounted at the stone slope outside the Niō Gate, and from this point forward took only stewards, caretakers, palanquin attendants, and sandal bearers. Near the Nitenmon Gate, Shōson-in and the deputy abbot were waiting to greet me and provided guidance. I performed ablutions at the bronze vessels to the left inside the Niō Gate, and changed sandal bearers at the bottom of the wooden steps of Yōmeimon Gate. From this point forward I took stewards, caretakers, and both sword bearers. At the gate outside this location, I removed my sword and had the sword bearer carry it, with Shōson-in managing all other arrangements. Regarding tomorrow's procedures for my personal ceremony, monks who were deputies of Dairakuin and shrine attendants were present and I confirmed arrangements with them. From there I viewed the interior of the main shrine and withdrew as before.

I proceeded to inspect the interior of the mausoleum and dismounted in front of Hokkedō Hall. Again as before, the temple lodging managed everything, and at the inner Karamon Gate, Head Priest Ryūkō-in came out to greet me. Both the temple lodging Shōson-in and he explained tomorrow's ceremony, so I received their instructions. Regarding the inner sanctuary, I was told that since Ryūkō-in would manage everything for the imperial representative, there was no need even for inspection, so I did not proceed there. From there I inspected the mausoleum area and appropriately greeted Ryūkō-in, then withdrew in the company of Shōson-in.

1. I also visited the main shrine and new shrine, and toured Takinoo Mountain. Again the temple lodging accompanied me, and after this was completed, I proceeded to temple lodging Shōson-in, received the gōhan ceremony, was served a meal, and after this was finished, returned to my lodgings at Hachiishi after seven-thirty.
　Note: During the gōhan ceremony, one must remain with hands placed [in respectful position]. Also, my retainers, stewards, caretakers, and physician were in attendance.

　Same day, the 20th

1. Before six o'clock at dawn I departed, wearing the bestowed ceremonial court dress with family crest.

I dismounted in front of Hokkedō Hall at the mausoleum, and from this point took only stewards, caretakers, and palanquin attendants. Shōson-in came out to greet me at the Niō Gate, and Nikkō-assigned officers also came out to provide guidance. Ryūkō-in came to wait, and the Nikkō magistrate as well as the attending physician and deputy were also present. I took a seat in the upper position facing these people, beside the alcove.

1. Then at the six o'clock bell, soon after the temple head climbed the mountain and entered the mausoleum, there was guidance. Following Shōson-in's guidance I proceeded to the mausoleum, taking stewards, caretakers, and palanquin attendants. I changed sandal bearers at the bottom of the wooden steps of Yasha Gate. At the top of the stone steps I removed my sword and had the sword bearer carry it, then entered the mausoleum. There was a purification basin on the right side, so I performed ablutions, then untied my hakama cords on the right side outside the Karamon Gate. Inside the Karamon Gate on the left and right, the magistrate and other attending physicians prostrated themselves - no greeting was necessary - and I ascended the stairs. At this point music began, I entered inside the front doors, remained facing sideways, briefly performed a middle bow, and took my seat on the tatami below the green bamboo blind on the right side in the center.
　Note: No middle bow was necessary in the presence of the temple head.

1. The Buddhist service began with the temple head's officiating, and after the ceremonial service was completed, the temple head entered directly into the inner sanctuary and offered incense. Soon after, Ryūkō-in came before where I was seated, there was a greeting, and he led the way into the inner sanctuary, at which point music began.

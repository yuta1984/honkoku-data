1. Regarding tomorrow's departure permission, I sent notification letters to the chief inspectors and inspectors who would attend the same ceremony, as per established precedent.
1. To the reserve Lord Oki-no-kami, I sent a written message.
1. From the hour of the cock this dawn, the weather has been clear.
　　　　Same month, 8th day
1. Having been granted permission for departure to Nikko, I wore lined court dress with half-hakama, left home before half past six, and reported to the castle. Through the Buddhist monks I sent word that I would report to the inspectors, and received acknowledgment. Then, before the Council of Elders' arrival at the castle, I requested the inspectors' assistance and conducted the ceremony for receiving official gifts in the Hame-no-ma room.

1. I also met with Lord Yokose Suruga-no-kami of the high-ranking families and requested his assistance for today's proceedings.
1. When the Council of Elders arrived at the castle, I went to my seat and handed my tabi to the Buddhist monks.
　　However, the festival magistrate Daishizen also had departure permission, so I consulted with him and went to our seats.
1. Inspector Ōkusa Daishizen called for me to come over, so with his guidance I went to the Yamabuki-no-ma room, seated myself with the sliding doors behind me. Festival magistrate Daishizen Yanagisawa Ise-no-kami sat in the same place, with myself keeping a slight distance from him.
1. After the locked entrance opened, I entered the Seiko-no-ma cedar door interior on the 17th day, and as Nikko deputy took my seat after the high-ranking families. The festival magistrate did the same. When Lord Uemura Suruga bowed, following after the high-ranking families, I entered the locked entrance area and at the second turn Lord Bitchū-no-kami took his seat, so the high-ranking families, myself, and the festival magistrate all prostrated ourselves. At that time official gifts were bestowed, received by high-ranking family member Lord Yokose Suruga-no-kami, and immediately fans and short swords were placed there. Then, guided by Lord Suruga, we went to the Hakutaka cedar door interior, where the high-ranking families and I positioned ourselves facing the sliding doors, waiting beside Lord Suruga's seat. Lord Bitchū bowed to Lord Suruga, the high-ranking families came forward to the lord's presence, and after this was completed, I came forward in the same manner with bows.
In the Goza-no-ma lower platform, I slid forward from three feet outside the threshold and prostrated myself. Lord Bitchū-no-kami announced only my name, and then there was an official pronouncement. Facing toward the front, I came forward and slid up from the first tatami of the lower platform, positioned myself at the lacquered veranda at about the level where the black ornamental ridge hangs, slightly raised my head and prostrated myself. The official pronouncement was "You are appointed as Nikko deputy on the twentieth day." I prostrated myself, slid down from the upper platform, descended only to the first tatami and turned right, then seated myself on the first tatami at a position where my hands could reach the edge of the second tatami inside the threshold of the lower platform. Turning my face only toward the duty officer, there was an exchange: "Permission for departure to Nikko is granted. Moreover, you should be grateful for the official gifts." I turned right and withdrew. In the corridor I put on my short sword, and at the Seiko veranda an inspector asked "Is there any discomfort?" I replied that there was no discomfort. Immediately I seated myself in the narrow corridor outside the Oshidori cedar doors with the sliding doors behind me, and at the inspector's bow went to the Hame-no-ma room, seated myself in front of where the official gifts' ceremonial covers were placed, prostrated myself, and faced toward the chamberlain.

I received [the offering], and when the temple head offered side dishes, I approached his side still wearing my sword, received them, and withdrew to my original place. When I requested to pour in return, he instructed me to return the cup, so I declined through the temple administrator, but when he insisted again, I poured sake into the earthenware cup and handed it to the attendant. The attendant placed the cup on the three-legged stand and presented it to the temple head.

Seeing him take it in his hands, I waited for the appropriate moment, and after the attendant withdrew the cup, the temple head retired to his private quarters. Returning to the meal as before, the second soup course was replaced with sweet bean soup, and after finishing with hot water, sweets were served twice in the latter part. After tea was finished, I withdrew to my original seat. Soon the temple head appeared again, so under the caretaker's guidance, as with yesterday's audience, I sat at the threshold edge, then proceeded as yesterday, turned toward the temple administrator, and stated that I was deeply grateful to have received the meal. There was acknowledgment and the temple head showed courtesy. At this point, the sword and horse fee that the attendant had brought were displayed within the threshold of the upper room, there were polite ceremonial greetings, and after prostrating, I addressed the temple administrator requesting to retire to his private quarters. At that time, there were greetings conveying messages from the elders, which the temple administrator acknowledged.

When the temple head retired, I immediately withdrew, tucked my fan and brought my sword, proceeding to the waiting room. I placed the sword beside the entrance-side alcove as before and sat in the initial position. When the temple administrator and caretaker came, I stated that I was deeply grateful for their continued kindness, then expressed greetings to both for their various assistance. They also spoke of gratitude for the gifts sent, so I offered appropriate greetings. Immediately under the guidance of both, I moved out, and in the corridor there were send-offs by the magistrate and attending physician among others, to whom I expressed gratitude for their various assistance. At the place where I had initially tied up my hakama, I tied up the long hakama. To the ceremonial platform, temple officials, the temple administrator, caretakers and others came out to send me off as they had welcomed me. I briefly stayed below, made courtesies and returned. I departed to outside the temple gate and returned, then on the bamboo matting of the entrance, still wearing my sword, I gave the following message to the attendant:

As follows:
　Today I am deeply grateful for the meal and sake cup that were graciously provided. As I will soon depart from this locality, I have come to express my gratitude. Please convey this to the temple administrator.
After this was completed, I went to the residence of Tsuchiya Chikugo-no-kami's representative and handed the attendant the following written message:
　On this occasion, I have served without incident as imperial representative, which brings great joy. I am grateful for the various considerations shown to me. As I will soon depart from this locality, I have come to convey this message.

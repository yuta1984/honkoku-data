I stated this, withdrew from my seat, and immediately departed. From there I visited the senior councilors of both compounds and made my reports to all.
After this was completed, I arrived at the residence after half past nine.
1. I sent introductory letters to the senior inspector and inspectors whom I rely upon for affairs.
1. To Oki-no-kami, I sent a messenger announcing my arrival.

1. After arriving, I also gave direct replies to the messenger from deputy Oki-no-kami as well as messengers from close relatives.
1. Only to my colleagues of the current service did I announce my return to the capital, and also that there was an official notice for tomorrow's
　audience, which the caretaker sent out by official notice.
1. I sent introductory messengers to the junior councilors and chamberlains of both compounds.
　　　　Same day, the 24th
1. Today, for the return from the capital
　audience and formal statement, I wore the bestowed noshi-me hakama and purified myself,
　departing the residence at five o'clock and ascending to the castle. I sent word through a monk that I would appear before the inspector, and
　received acknowledgment. When the senior councilors ascended to the castle, I approached the seat,
　merely looked ahead and removed my tabi. Soon Inspector Ōkusa Shuzen instructed me to approach, so
　accompanied by him and following the diagram, I waited behind the sliding doors of the wainscoting.
　After some time passed, guided by Inspector Shuzen, I crossed through the timekeeper's quarters corridor,
　Shuzen took his seat in front of the new guard station, and I took the middle seat next to him. Meanwhile, Junior Councilor
　Uemura Suruga-no-kami arrived, and guided by him through the upper room of the bamboo room, the upper
　verandah cheek, inside the cedar sliding doors, I ascended one tatami mat, and following the diagram, placed my short sword on the left side and waited,
　bowing to the junior councilors and following behind Suruga-no-kami.
　I took the middle seat and waited outside the cedar sliding doors of the third room of the audience chamber. At Suruga-no-kami's
　signal, I crossed the threshold of the third room's verandah, and from about three

　shaku in front of the threshold of the lower platform's verandah, I slid forward and prostrated myself. Only the name of the duty officer Lord Bitchū-no-kami was announced, and at the
　command "approach," I came to face His Lordship directly, and from the first tatami mat of the upper platform, I slid
　upward as during the departure audience and made the following formal statement:
　　　On the past 20th day, at Nikkō at the Sacred Mausoleum,
　　　I successfully performed the proxy worship, the weather was favorable, and everything was
　　　completed without any shortcomings.
　After completing this formal statement, I slid down to the lower platform, turned to the right, placed my hands on the second tatami mat from below and
　prostrated myself. When I turned my face only toward the duty officer, there was acknowledgment regarding the gratitude for performing the return
　audience, and at that time there was a gracious command about my hard work and great service.
　Again when I turned my face only toward the duty officer, there was acknowledgment of my gratitude for receiving
　the gracious command. I turned to the right, withdrew from my seat, and at the bamboo room verandah,
　put on my short sword and withdrew as initially. Since I had previously arranged for one inner monk to accompany me,
　I proceeded with him to around the timekeeper's quarters, at this point went out to the middle room,
　withdrew from the wainscoting room to the yamabuki room, went to the seat and announced to the attendants of the day, then
　immediately departed. I ascended to the Western Compound, and as usual in the wild goose
　room, I had an audience with the master of ceremonies Honda Bungo-no-kami, expressed my gratitude and departed. From there,
　I expressed my gratitude to the senior councilors and junior councilors of the Western Compound and returned home after nine o'clock.

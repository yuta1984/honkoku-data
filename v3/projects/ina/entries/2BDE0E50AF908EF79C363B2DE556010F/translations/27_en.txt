3rd day

1. Left the residence a little past 5:30 (around 9 AM), wearing silk summer formal attire (kamishimo), and attended the castle.
1. Regarding appearing due to an official summons, [I] sent word through a monk to the metsuke, whereupon Daijūkurōbei acknowledged the message. Those who appeared today for the official summons were Lord Matsudaira Kii-no-kami, Lord Nagai Shinano-no-kami (represented by Lord Honjō Ōmi-no-kami due to illness), Niwa Shikibu-shōyū, and Lord Yonekura Tango-no-kami, all of whom received instructions together. Seating arrangements were discussed and decided. Lord Kii-no-kami received separate instructions. Matters of collective conduct and expressing gratitude were also coordinated. Among the Kōke families, Toda Bingo-no-kami and Nakajō Kawachi-no-kami were also summoned, so today's conduct was also discussed. After the rōjū (senior councilors) assembled, the tsumeri-bi members Lord Sakai Shūri and Lord Doi Noto also appeared at the common seating.

1. After assembling, Metsuke Yamaki Wakasa-no-kami came to the Kari-no-ma and showed us the seating arrangement document, which I read. Since my name and Lord Kii-no-kami's appeared after the two Kōke members, I acknowledged this with greetings. Soon the rōjū made their rounds of the reception rooms, so [we] waited behind the Fuyō veranda and Kari shoji area, after the two Kōke members. Lord Matsudaira Kii-no-kami waited on the veranda from Teikan-no-ma to Kane-no-ma. After the rōjū's room visits and the tsumeri-bi members' courtesy calls were completed, under the metsuke's direction, the two Kōke members took their seats and received the appointment as Nikkō representatives for the 17th. Both myself and Lord Matsudaira Kii-no-kami took our seats together from the central pillar of Fuyō-no-ma, with the rōjū seated in rows. Goyōban Matsudaira Izu-no-kami announced that we were appointed as Nikkō representatives for the coming 20th as written in the document, and handed over one official document. I received it, immediately opened and read the document, then passed it to Lord Kii-no-kami. After he read it, both Lord Kii-no-kami and I expressed our gratitude for this honor. Lord Kii-no-kami immediately folded the document, placed it in his breast, and we withdrew.
　　However, since the document was returned to me, I handed it to my deputy in the middle room.

1. After this concluded, three people took their seats: Lord Honjō Ōmi-no-kami (representing Lord Nagai Shinano-no-kami), Niwa Shikibu-shōyū, and Lord Yonekura Tango-no-kami, and were appointed as festival magistrates and their deputies for the Nikkō festival on the 17th.

1. With the rōjū seated in rows, one official document handed over by Lord Izu-no-kami was as follows:

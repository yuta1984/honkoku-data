1. From there, all my colleagues went around to the Take-no-ma at the main entrance, while I remained in my seat. Soon it appeared that the courtesy ceremony participants were finishing and gathering, so I gauged the timing and took my seat in front of the Oshidori sliding doors. Lord Bitchū-no-kami appeared in the Hame-no-ma, the inspector offered guidance, and I passed through the Yamabuki-no-ma and headed toward the Hame-no-ma. Emerging from the right room of the pillar area there, I positioned myself about one tatami mat's distance from Lord Bitchū-no-kami in the center, then advanced to receive the official document, and again seated myself about one tatami mat away. To the magistrate official, I inquired through official message: "Should I follow precedent as before?" I was told "Follow precedent as before and be diligent in all matters," received this instruction, and withdrew. Then, since my own caretaker was waiting at the middle entrance, I handed the official document to him and departed. For tomorrow morning's departure, I made farewell visits to the elders as duty required, submitted notification only to the duty officer, and returned home after the ninth hour.

1. When appointed to serve as座敷番 (seating attendant) for entertaining court nobles, one goes to the middle room (naka-no-ma) to partake of the御料理 (official cuisine). In the morning when going to the castle, one must report this to the metsuke (inspectors).
   Previously, one would partake of food in the room where the座敷奉行 (seating magistrate) was stationed, but recently we have requested to move to the middle room instead. Therefore, we have informed the metsuke that "when appointed as座敷奉行, we will partake of the official cuisine in the middle room."

1. If any of the仲ヶ間衆 (middle room attendants) are late for castle duty, their group members shall send word.

1. When visiting the三家 (three Tokugawa branch families), one carries the sword drawn. When passing by, one carries the drawn sword in hand while ascending.

1. When receiving sake from His Lordship, one bows toward those serving the sake. One does not present side dishes, except in very special circumstances.

1. When attending castle for Noh performances and feeling unwell, before the intermission (o-chunyū) one must definitely report to both the monthly duty officer and the chief inspector. After the intermission, one may return home by notifying the middle room attendants.

1. For preliminary visits to Momijiyama, one naturally wears long formal dress (chō-kamishimo). Recently, tabi (split-toe socks) are used, though previously tabi were never used.

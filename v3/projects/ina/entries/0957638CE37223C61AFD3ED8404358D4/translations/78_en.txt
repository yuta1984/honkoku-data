1. On the same day, for the御謡初め (first Noh chanting ceremony), wearing ceremonial dress with long hakama, one goes to the castle after seven o'clock and appears at the usual seat.
   However, regarding the location for receiving sake, this was discussed and noted among those of the same rank.
   Concerning the above matter, when everyone proceeds to the Great Hall, all go together and take their seats in order.

1. His Lordship appears and takes his seat on the middle platform of the Great Hall. The Three Branch Houses (Gosanke) take their seats, and the accompanying retainers sit in formation. Soup and dishes are served, and the first offering is completed. After His Lordship withdraws, sake cups are passed to the Three Branch Houses and the accompanying retainers. The sake service begins - first with one sake server, then with two. When those of the same rank receive their portion, they come forward in pairs, receive the sake, immediately withdraw and return to their previous seats. After the sake service is completed and the archery ceremony concludes, the senior councilor on duty passes the court jacket (kataginu) from the middle platform to Master Kanze. Immediately, the senior councilor announces that the Three Branch Houses as well as the various daimyo and officials should also remove their court jackets, and everyone removes their jackets and places them beside themselves.
   All the court jackets are sent to Master Kanze's residence, to be retrieved later. Names are written inside the jackets.

1. The Three Branch Houses withdraw, the hereditary retainers take their seats and offer congratulations to the senior councilors before withdrawing. In alternation, all members of the Chrysanthemum Chamber from the same rank take their seats, offer congratulations to the senior councilors, and immediately withdraw. Naturally, they withdraw while still holding their court jackets.

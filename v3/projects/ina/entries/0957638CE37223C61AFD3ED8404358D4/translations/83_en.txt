One: When there are receptions, entertainment, and Noh performances for court nobles,
     wear noshi-me and long hakama, and arrive at the castle before 5 o'clock or at 6:30.
One: When the lord emerges, line up facing south at the threshold edge of the far room of the Great Hall.
     During audiences with court nobles,
     when the sliding doors open, prostrate yourselves; when the sliding doors
     close, line up on the southern polished wooden floor to watch the Noh performance.
     Around the second act, when the hereditary retainers' meal is finished, the group leaders
     provide guidance, and after receiving the meal in the Willow Room,
     offer thanks in unison to the group leaders, then return to the original seats.
     During the intermission, there is no fixed rule about where to wait;
     observe where the fellow attendees are waiting and wait there. When the fourth act
     begins, return to seats again. Shortly before the celebratory Noh performance ends,
     all fellow attendees line up at the threshold edge where they previously
     had their audience.
     When the lord emerges, proceed as before; after the lord's entrance, all fellow attendees
     proceed through the veranda of the Hibiscus Room to the Hibiscus Room,
     line up and wait, receive greetings from the senior councilors, then withdraw.
One: For responses to imperial messengers and temple messengers, wear formal crested robes and arrive

     with nothing special.

On the 17th day of the 7th month of Genbun 3, Year of the Horse, Lord Sakai Bingo-no-kami and Lord Manabe Wakasa-no-kami were serving their duty day when the ōmetsuke (chief inspector) instructed Lord Wakasa-no-kami to withdraw because he was in mourning. Subsequently, regarding this matter, Lord Matsudaira Izu-no-kami spoke to the ōmetsuke, and Lords Miyake Suō-no-kami and Inō Shimotsuke strictly conveyed that henceforth, those in mourning should arrange substitute duty attendance on the 17th of each month as appropriate. This was communicated via circular letter from Lord Sakai Bingo-no-kami on the following 18th day.

On the 28th day when there is no monthly ceremony, during the Shōgun's hawking excursions, only the kōke-shū (high families) and sōja-ban-shū (protocol officers) attend the castle. Therefore, it would be appropriate for the Gan-no-ma (Wild Goose Room attendants) to follow suit. However, after attending on the 28th and consulting with Miyake Bōshū, it was said that abstaining would be difficult, and following the example of the protocol officers would be appropriate. Accordingly, upon further consultation with the high families and protocol officers, it was confirmed that only the duty guards attend the castle. Indeed, on the 28th day without ceremony when there is an imperial visit, only those on duty should attend, as agreed upon. Of course, this matter was also strictly communicated to Bōshū.

Naturally, during visits by the Dainagon (Major Counselor), it was agreed that all should attend the castle without exception.

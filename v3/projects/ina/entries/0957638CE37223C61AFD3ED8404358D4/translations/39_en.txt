《Marginal note: One copy of era name characters, one copy of official notice》attached

We respectfully send greetings by circular notice. Today, regarding the general attendance, when we attended our duties, concerning the matter of changing the era name, it was reported from Kyoto that "Kōka" has been determined as the imperial decision. This was announced by Lord Abe Ise-no-kami in the presence of assembled senior councilors in the Kari-no-ma (Wild Geese Room). Furthermore, as it was said to be handed down by the same person, Watanabe Nōshū conveyed the copy of the era name characters along with one copy of the official notice, making two documents in total for circulation. Please pass these along in order, and the final recipient should return them to Settsu-no-kami. That is all.

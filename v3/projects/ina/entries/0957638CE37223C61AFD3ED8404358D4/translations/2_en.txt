1. Haori jackets and kosode robes need not be limited to those with family crests; plain materials such as Tango-shima, Gunai-shima, silk tsumugi, and other similar modest fabrics may be worn at one's discretion.

1. Hakama trousers should follow the same guidelines as the above clothing.
   However, regarding items already in one's possession, these may be used at discretion, but as much as possible they should not be extravagant. As long as they are not unsightly, there is no problem at all, and instructions should be given to use plain clothing as much as possible.

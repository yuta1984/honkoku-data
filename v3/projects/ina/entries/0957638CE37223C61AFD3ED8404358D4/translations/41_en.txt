1. Regarding those who attended today:
It is not necessary to offer congratulations to His Excellency the Major General of the Right, but attendance is required. Those with domains of ten thousand koku or more, as well as those who did not attend due to illness or young age, should offer congratulations through messengers to Yamashiro-no-kami's residence. Those in their domains or estates should send express messengers.
The above matters should be communicated accordingly.

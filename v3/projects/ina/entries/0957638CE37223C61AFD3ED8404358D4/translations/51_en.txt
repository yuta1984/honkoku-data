From those who have been dispatched as assistants, we shall later arrange for return duty shifts. Although at present assistants are being declined due to ongoing fire watch duties, unlike regular assistants, emergency assistants are based on requests, and since return duty shifts are also arranged, they will not be exempted. Details will be communicated by the Master of Palace Repairs through a circular notice.

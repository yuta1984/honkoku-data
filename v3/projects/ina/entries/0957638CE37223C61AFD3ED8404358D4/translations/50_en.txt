Normally, assistants should be sent in advance, but if they are sent from the hour of the Snake (around 8 AM) on the day itself, the extent of any problems cannot be known. Therefore, emergency assistants should be designated in advance, and a duty rotation system should be established. On those days, one should remain at one's lodgings from morning until the hour of the Horse (noon), staying alert. Although we call them "emergency assistants," this arrangement depends on mutual consultation. Therefore, no circular notices regarding assistants are issued.

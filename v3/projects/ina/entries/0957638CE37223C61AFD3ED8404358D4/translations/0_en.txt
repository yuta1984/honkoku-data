Regarding the written directive issued by Lord Ii Hyōbu-shōyū on the 19th day of this first month:

Until now, when ordered to assemble for the lord's outings (go-nari), there have been occasions when departures were early. However, among the retainers in attendance, there are naturally those who have consultations with various parties, and others who, considering it important, would arrive one hour (two hours) early or even one and a half hours early, even when no special early orders were given. While this is commendable, depending on the timing of the lord's departure, having to arrive exceptionally early from the middle of the night would cause difficulties for everyone. Therefore, it has been decreed that henceforth, the assembly time shall not be set earlier than the designated hour for gathering the retinue. Accordingly, all members of the retinue should be notified that they are to assemble by the designated assembly time.

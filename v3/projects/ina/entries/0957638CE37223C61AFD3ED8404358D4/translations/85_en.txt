     After the formal dining in the lord's presence is completed, middle captains, lesser captains, chamberlains, and fourth rank officials,
     three to four at a time, withdraw and receive confections. From the various officials,
     five to six at a time withdraw together, and after the hereditary retainers are finished, those of the same rank
     exit in order of their stipend amounts.
     However, the page-announcers intermingle as they withdraw, and as soon as they receive their gifts,
     they may exit regardless of order. The rice cakes are given to the monk attendants.

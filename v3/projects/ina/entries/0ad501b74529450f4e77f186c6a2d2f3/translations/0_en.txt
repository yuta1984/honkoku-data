Memorandum

One item: 1 ryō 3 bu in gold, for 8 people
479 mon in copper coins

The above concerns advance payment for workers who went to work as stone cutters for the Enōura fortification project in Sagami Province. I have certainly received this portion of the advance payment submission without any discrepancy. I will exchange this for the official receipt later. This document serves as proof thereof.

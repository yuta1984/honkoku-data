Lord Shuri-no-suke Shōgetsu was the founder of the temple's restoration, and Monk Kōrin is called the founding patriarch of this restoration.

Notably, the eighth-generation Sokuhō built the main gate, the ninth-generation Ryōfu rebuilt the main hall and established the monks' quarters, the tenth-generation Ryōshi built the bell tower and sutra repository, and the eleventh-generation Sotsura

　　Record of the Yūgao Kannon Hall in Shinshū

The Bodhisattva, out of compassion for all sentient beings, follows their various forms and responds to their circumstances, going wherever needed and manifesting physical forms to serve as an unrequested friend. Sometimes showing signs in wood and stone, sometimes appearing in the form of clams, through various skillful means the Bodhisattva causes those with wrong views to abandon evil and return to righteousness. If there are those who fall into suffering and danger, by single-mindedly reciting the name they can greatly attain liberation. Ah, how vast is the Bodhisattva's compassionate vow! How could people not believe in and revere this?

The Jurinji Temple in Takato, Shinshū Province, was built by Hoshina Danjō-chū. In the hall is enshrined a sacred image of Kannon Daishi, which is named Yūgao (Evening Glory). Searching for the origins of this image, there was a temple called Jurinji in Sōshū Province during a time of calamity. It happened to encounter the disaster of fire, and both the temple hall and the sacred image of Daishi were reduced to ashes. One night, a family had a spiritual dream, and suddenly on the former temple site a single stem of bottle gourd sprouted. Eventually it grew vines and bore gourds. When the family handled and split open the gourd, inside was the sacred image of Daishi, exactly as it had been originally.

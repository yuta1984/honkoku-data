Moreover, because the journey to the head temple was extremely far and quite inconvenient, the second abbot Nicchō presented the circumstances in detail to the head temple and requested to be newly affiliated with Kuonji Temple at Mount Minobu. Having received permission, they changed the temple name to Chōonji. Later, during the Keichō era (some three hundred years ago from now), Hoshina Higo-no-kami, the lord of Takato Castle, donated the present land and moved the temple here. Subsequently, during the Shōhō era in the time of the nineteenth abbot Nichiryu, disputes arose between the head and branch temples that could not be resolved. Eventually, they returned the temple name to Minobu, were again affiliated with Myōkenji, and changed the temple name to Rengeji.

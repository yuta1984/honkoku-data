Furthermore, I respectfully add:

I humbly write this letter. Though it is the height of summer heat, I am extremely pleased to know that you are in good health as always.

Now then, we have come here following established custom to conduct the inspection and supervision of the kijishi (woodturners). I humbly apologize for the inconvenience, but I am most grateful that you have been taking such good care of the kijishi in your domain. I respectfully request your continued favor in the future. The above.

Regarding the pledge document we respectfully submit:

Concerning the autumn re-examination of religious affiliations, we understand that you have been extremely busy with various official duties at this time. However, we have humbly received your order to conduct the population census ourselves this year. Under the supervision of the town elders, town representative, and group leaders, we have conducted the examination and found that the religious affiliations and population records are exactly the same as in the spring examination, with no discrepancies whatsoever.

1. Regarding increases and decreases in population, we submit the ledger on separate paper.

We have carefully examined the entire town as stated above and found no suspicious persons whatsoever. Should you hear of any issues, please impose whatever punishment you deem appropriate, considering it entirely our fault. For future reference, therefore respectfully submitted as above.

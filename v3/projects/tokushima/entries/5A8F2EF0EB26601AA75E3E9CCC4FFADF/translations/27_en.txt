When she delivered it, all the tanuki sitting in rows were astonished, saying "Oh, what terrifying supernatural strength!" and sighed while looking at each other's faces. Rokūemon took up that letter and opened it to read, and in that letter it said:

"I urgently send this letter to Lord Rokūemon. We traveled this long distance to reach you, and striving with all our might to achieve high office, we were about to receive our appointment as scheduled in just one day and return home to be revered as Inari Myōjin and make all people submit to us. We were almost in great joy when unexpectedly the lord's evil thoughts arose and he plotted to deceive and attack us - this is like a mantis raising its axe against an oncoming carriage, as they say. This too is Heaven's will. Moreover, since my trusted retainer Takagi Sakuemon has been killed, how could I not avenge that enemy? Tomorrow I will quickly lead my forces and attack. At that time, make sure you do not panic and become flustered.

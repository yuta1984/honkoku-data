Collecting herself and calming her heart, when she thought it through, this must surely be Rokuzaemon's doing - her husband had been killed because his secret communications with Lord Kinchō had been discovered. If so, then the enemy was Rokuzaemon. She could not leave this as it was. "Come, I shall storm in and strike him down!" she started to rush forth, but then turned back: "No, no, the enemy is the renowned Rokuzaemon. For a woman to go alone would be of no benefit - I would only be killed. In this situation, I must go to Hiakaino and ask Lord Kinchō to avenge my husband's death." Having settled on this plan, she tearfully buried her husband's corpse in the nearby grass, wiped away her tears, returned to her home, made various preparations, and that night secretly set out in haste toward the shrine hall of Hiakaino village.

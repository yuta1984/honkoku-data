they remained there, but since this would lead nowhere, they called forth messengers and urged the wicked tanuki from the nearby villages and surrounding areas to join them. In particular, they sent special envoys to Tokushima's Rinkōji temple and Kōshin Shinhachirou and others, requesting their military assistance. All agreed and set out with their subordinate tanuki, adding twenty-five or twenty-six clan members or a hundred tanuki each as splendid reinforcements - truly a fearless undertaking.

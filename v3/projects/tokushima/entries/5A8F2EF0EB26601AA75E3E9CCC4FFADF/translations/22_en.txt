Taka was bitten to death by Sakuemon and Hachibe, disappearing like dew on grass. At that time, Kinchō was fighting against Rokuemon, Kyūzaemon, Yakuemon and others, but though he witnessed Taka's death in battle, he could not rescue him. Even while receiving wounds in several places himself, he continued to growl and run about—a terrifying sight like a dragon that had sprouted wings. Overwhelmed by his fierce energy, Rokuemon and all the others trembled in fear and, like mice chased by a cat, fled over the mountain and escaped into the Hole Kannon temple.

Kinchō bared his white fangs without distinguishing between large and small tanuki and raged wildly. Now that not a single enemy remained, he clung to Taka's corpse and shed tears, saying "I wanted to save you, but being separated by the multitude, I could not do so and have let you meet such a regrettable end"—sometimes lamenting, sometimes raging. But in any case, the enemy was Rokuemon. He prepared himself to go out and fight a decisive battle to hold a memorial service for Taka's soul, and as he rushed forth, Kanoko of Mount Tsuda came toward him.

Therefore, there is a matter of confidential discussion with you, so you should come to Ana Kannon immediately." When this was said, Kanoko replied "Yes!" and sent the messenger back. Without any suspicion, she alone set out for Ana Kannon and arrived there. Soon she came to Rokuzaemon's dwelling, was led by a guide to the main hall.

Kanoko showed no sign of fear and prostrated herself, saying "Today I have been commanded regarding a confidential discussion about the subjugation of Kinchō, so though I am ill, I have come to serve."

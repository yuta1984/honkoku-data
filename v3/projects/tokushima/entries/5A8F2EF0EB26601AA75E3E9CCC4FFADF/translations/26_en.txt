tried to push it over, and his strength was like nothing less than a violent storm. Now I could no longer endure it and fell headfirst down from the pine tree. At that moment, I had already resolved to be killed, but Kinchō said, 'Though it would be very easy for me to kill you, I bear no grudge against you from the start. My targeted enemies are Rokūemon, Kyūzaemon, and the others. Therefore I will spare your life, so take this letter back and deliver it to Rokūemon,' speaking words of benevolence.

I replied, 'Though you are an enemy, you are truly a magnificent general. However, I am not the kind of tanuki who would shamefully return home with my life spared after being overpowered. Please kill and devour me quickly.' But Kinchō would not listen at all, saying, 'Even if I spare one tanuki like you, it will hardly make much difference as an enemy. Return quickly while no one is watching.' I was powerless and, though filled with regret, returned home." Breathlessly telling this story, she presented that letter to Rokūemon.

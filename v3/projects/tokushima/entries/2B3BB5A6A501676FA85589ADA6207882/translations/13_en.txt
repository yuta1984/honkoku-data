The number of those who died from being struck down by falling objects is unknown. In various places, the earth cracked and shifted, with gaps of about 10 to 20 ken occurring in numerous locations. Particularly in the villages of the Ina district's Jikake area, there was a massive rupture extending across houses and fields, about 7-8 ken wide and 4 chō long, into which countless people and animals fell. From within, muddy water, fire, and smoke burst forth mixed together, making bright daylight as dark as night. The terrifying sight of the firelight was indescribable, and the entire area became a muddy sea. 

What will become of this situation in the future? Given the current state of affairs, it seems that the entire province of Shinshū will likely see its population decimated. At present, His Lordship was in residence in the domain, and we have heard that he evacuated to an area of bamboo groves about 10 chō square in Aoike Village, south of the castle. However, we are uncertain about his life or death. Ueda, Komoro, and other areas suffered similarly, but since they are in other domains, we do not have detailed information. We urgently report these matters.

The document should be organized properly.

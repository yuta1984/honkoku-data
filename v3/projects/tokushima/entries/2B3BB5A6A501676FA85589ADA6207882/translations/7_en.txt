In the area of Sarashina District, near the two villages of Antei and Kohirabayashi [mistakenly written as Yamahirabayashi], there is a high mountain called Iwakura-yama. Half of both ends of this mountain collapsed and slid down—one section about thirty chō and another about five chō in length—pushing into the river and burying the surrounding area, including some villages. However, since the area consists of massive rocks, it appears that the water flow cannot cut through them. As a result, the accumulated water has gradually risen about seven to eight jō above normal water level. This has submerged several villages, and the area now resembles a lake. Of course, I have ordered various countermeasures, but given that it involves a large mountain, particularly with massive rocks having pushed in, human efforts may be insufficient. Moreover, the people of Kawanakajima, fearing that this accumulated water might overflow somewhere and suddenly rush out, have evacuated to higher ground in terror. The people of Tanbajima face similar circumstances and cannot maintain horse relay stations. I have ordered every possible measure to be taken, but first I submit this report. I will report the details later. The above.

April 2nd

In this year of the Sheep, for the opening ceremony of Zenkoji Temple in Shinano Province, twenty-three people with the following names from our post station departed on March 16th as a group to make pilgrimage. They were staying at the inn called Wataya run by Jinzaemon in front of Zenkoji Temple when, around 9 o'clock on the night of April 24th, a great earthquake occurred. Not only Jinzaemon's inn but also neighboring houses and others collapsed, and furthermore fires broke out. As listed below, some people's whereabouts became unknown or they were injured. Among the traveling companions, those who were unharmed, along with instructions from the temple lodging Inari-in, had their relatives gradually depart. Last night on the 6th, they returned bringing back both the injured and unharmed people.

He repeatedly called for Shigezo but received no answer. As seven or eight people gradually crawled out to that spot, a fire broke out and the earthquake continued without stopping, making it dangerous. So all these people together fled to the Zenkoji temple grounds, where they found that the Niomon gate had collapsed. From that location to the main hall, a distance of about four cho, an area more than three ken wide had been shaken apart and torn up as if the ground had been dug up. The fifty-seven temple quarters on the south side had all collapsed, with no one remaining there. At the rear of that location, about 150-160 monks and laypeople, both men and women, had safely taken refuge. By dawn, more than half of the pilgrims and local people had died, and most of those who barely escaped with their lives were injured, creating great turmoil. Generally around noon on the following 25th day, they departed toward Oiwake and went to Tanba Island, where

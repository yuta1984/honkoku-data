Report on the Great Shinshū Earthquake of Kōka 4, Year of the Sheep

On the 24th day of this month, the daytime was clear and warm, extremely peaceful, but around 4 o'clock that night there was a great earthquake. In Nakanojō Village, Shinshū, the plastered walls of my jinya (local administrative office) compound were shaken down in various places. In addition, in the villages near the jinya, poor farmers had their attached buildings collapsed, experiencing severe tremors that continued for a while before gradually stopping. After a brief interval, continuous tremors occurred, with thunder-like sounds coming from the north of the jinya. Until dawn, there were approximately eighty or more earthquakes. The next morning was somewhat [number unclear], but the tremors have not ceased even now. In the villages of Minochi Village under my jurisdiction, there are said to be [number unclear] injuries and deaths, but no reports have been submitted yet.

Copy of the urgent report that arrived in Edo on the evening of March 27th via express messenger from Lord Sanada Shinano-no-kami

In the Matsushiro domain territory, including the castle town, rural areas, and Edo, since the middle of this month, luminous phenomena have been occurring day and night intermittently. Thunder was not particularly strong, but it resonated continuously throughout the day across the government district, the Yashiro-Togura area, and the Chiisagata district.

The Kawanakajima area shook particularly violently, collapsing into the Sai River that flows at the foot of Mount Iwakura. Beyond that, Saku and Ina districts became like a great sea, completely flooded.

In the post town, fires broke out from collapsed houses, burning down over a thousand houses extending to nearby villages. It happened to be during a special temple exhibition, and the number of monks and laypeople, both men and women, who died instantly or were injured among the pilgrims was countless as far as the eye could see - truly what the world calls "hell on earth." From Togakushi, Asama, and Mount Koma, the deep mountains burned for a full day, and wolves, foxes, and raccoon dogs all ran down to the villages by themselves, knocking down and trampling people as they ran, causing additional extraordinary deaths, along with those killed by large trees and building

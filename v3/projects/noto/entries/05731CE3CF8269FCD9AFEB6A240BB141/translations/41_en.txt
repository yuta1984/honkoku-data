Summary
In ancient times, there were district officials called sukune, tone, mokudai, daikan, as well as gun'yo shoya and shoji. In the current era, they are called tomura and kimoiri. In this province (Noto), many people still use "tone" as their family name. Regarding fiefs, in the past they were measured as so many cho and so many tan, or so many kan, thousands of kan, or tens of thousands of kan. This is the same as today's hundreds of koku, thousands of koku, and tens of thousands of koku. Generally, thirty bu in length and twelve bu in width makes one tan.

Ten tan make one cho. Superior rice fields have 500 bundles of public rice field per ten tan. One bundle equals five to of rice. Of course, there are distinctions between middle-grade and lower-grade fields. For kan-based fiefs, five tan of the above equals one kan. In ancient times, with Eiraku coins, rice was sold at four go eight shaku per ten mon, so ten kan of Eiraku equaled four to eight sho, and one hundred kan equaled forty-eight koku. For a fief with a nominal yield of 100 koku at an average tax rate of 4.8 bu, the total rice amounts to 48 koku. This can be understood from temple lands and shrine sustenance fields.

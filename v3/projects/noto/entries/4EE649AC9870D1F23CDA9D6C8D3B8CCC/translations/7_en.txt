the districts of Kahoku were granted by His Excellency the Taiko, and afterward we took Etchu by our own conquest. In this way, samurai who have worked hard from their youth and risen up should serve with hearts as great as Mount Fuji - such was his gracious opinion.

1. Arisawa Nagasada's marginal note states: The Battle of Moribe was on the thirteenth day of the fifth month of Eiroku 4 (1561). At this time, Lord Toshiie received an increase of 300 kan.

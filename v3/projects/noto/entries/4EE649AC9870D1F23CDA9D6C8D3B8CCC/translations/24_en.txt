He made an internal report about the northern campaign and immediately dispatched troops, passing through Omi province toward the Hokuriku region. Maeda Toshiie and Toshinaga served as the vanguard entering Etchu, etc. (20th day, Tsuchinoe-Uma) Hideyoshi's great army arrived at the Etchu border, etc. (24th day, Mizunoe-Inu) Toshiie and others advanced against Narimasa's main camp, with various armies following. Narimasa fought fiercely in resistance. Hideyoshi surrounded him with a great army for seven days. Oda Nobuo took pity on Narimasa and petitioned for his pardon from death. Hideyoshi granted this, etc. (29th day, Hinoto-U) Narimasa shaved his head, apologized, and surrendered, etc. On the first day of the intercalary month, Kinotono-Mi, Hideyoshi withdrew his army from Etchu and stationed it at Hinomiya for several days. Maeda Toshiie provided a feast and offered tea, and Etchu province was granted to Toshinaga.

The Sanshu-shi states: According to Keishu's analysis, the explanation in the Tsugan was probably an error by Master Hayashi based on unofficial histories. Toyotomi Hideyoshi raised his banner in Etchu on the first day of intercalary eighth month and came again to Oyama Castle. On the sixth day he departed Oyama Castle and returned to the capital. On the eleventh day of the ninth month (some say the twenty-first day), he rewarded our lord (Maeda Toshiie) by granting him Toyotomi's surname, and bestowed the three districts of Etchu upon our heir (Toshinaga).

First, according to Heiji's analysis: The old domain records all state that the granting of Etchu's three districts occurred on the eleventh day of the ninth month, while others say it was granted to the heir on the twenty-first day of the ninth month. This is presumably recorded based solely on the autograph letters that Hideyoshi granted to the domain founder. The vermillion seal document previously cited as evidence already states "Etchu is granted to Matazaemon." Based on this, it is clear that the three districts were granted before the seventh day of intercalary eighth month. The Kanei genealogical record states: Hideyoshi, impressed by his achievements before and after, granted Etchu province to his eldest son Toshinaga. This too was probably recorded based on autograph letters. The text of the regulatory notice for Kokokua Shokoji Temple is as follows:

I have respectfully read your letter. Regarding the matter of Etchu, it has been pardoned without request. Your departure is certain on the sixth day of next month. Both temples should accompany you. First, please cross over to E, and it would be appropriate to stay in Kaga province. With your large numbers, lodging arrangements cannot be fully prepared all at once. I have prepared and present the regulatory notice for within Kokokua temple grounds. Should there be any other matters requiring attention, please give your orders.

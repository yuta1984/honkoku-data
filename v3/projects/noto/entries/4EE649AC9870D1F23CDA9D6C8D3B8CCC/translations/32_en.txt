[Toshinaga] made Niikawa District the retirement territory for Lord Mitsumitsu. Niikawa's tribute rice assessment was extremely large, said to be no less than that of the entire province of Kaga. Honda Awa-no-kami Shigemasa was the younger brother of Honda Kōzuke-no-suke Masazumi, the second son of Honda Sado-no-kami Masanobu, an elder of the Tokugawa house. In Keichō 16, 8th month, he re-entered service with our domain, and there was an agreement that he would be granted 50,000 koku, but he was granted 30,000 koku with a promise of an additional 20,000 koku to be added later, as recorded in the Honda genealogy. However, on the 20th day of the 5th month of Keichō 19, Lord Toshinaga passed away, and on the 13th day of the 6th month, Honda Shigemasa's stipend was increased by 20,000 koku to make it 50,000 koku. On the 13th day of the 7th month, Honda Shigemasa and others went to Sunpu as emissaries of Lord Mitsumitsu, presented Lord Toshinaga's posthumous gifts, and through Honda Kōzuke-no-suke, made inquiries about the matter of the inherited territory of Niikawa District. Lord Ieyasu heard this and issued an imperial command that it should be granted to Mitsumitsu. {{Marginal note: This passage should be carefully examined}}

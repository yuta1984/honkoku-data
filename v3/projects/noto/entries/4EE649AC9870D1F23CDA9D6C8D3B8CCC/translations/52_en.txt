This letter dates to Keicho 16 (1611). The "Narita Family Record" states: "There are many samurai in Takaoka. What does the government think of this? Half of the retirement retainers, with stipends totaling 103,000 koku, were returned to Kanazawa." The "Record of Various Retainers' Words and Deeds" says: "When 100,000 koku of the lord's retirement domain were returned, the samurai district was in Takaoka town near Imaeda Minbu's area. Later, when 60,000 koku were returned, the samurai district was in Takaoka town near Asano River Sahashiri area."

The "Chronicle of Three Provinces" states: "The return of 100,000 koku occurred in Keicho 17 (1612). At this time, thirty-nine men including Maeda Mimasaka held stipends totaling 100,530 koku. Details about the subsequent return of 60,000 koku are unclear." The "Imaeda Genealogy" records: "In Keicho 18 (1613), 20,000 koku from Zuiryu-ko's 100,000 koku retirement domain were assigned to Princess Tama and returned to Kanazawa." Imaeda Naokata's personal record states: "Asai Masaemon said: 'Before the Osaka campaigns, Lord Hideyori sent Oda Samon as an envoy to Takaoka to convey his request. Zuiryu-ko's response was: My son Chikuzen-no-kami is the Inner Minister's son-in-law and will surely side with the Inner Minister. If you want me to respond to your summons, I will offer all my retirement retainers while I live.' Subsequently, 20,000 koku worth of stipends from retainers including Imaeda Soji, Kamio, and Tomita were returned."

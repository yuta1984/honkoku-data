Recording the Military Achievements of Lord Toshiie as follows:
1. His Excellency Toshiie of the First Rank had the childhood name Inuchiyo and grew up at Arako Castle in Owari Province, serving Lord Oda Nobunaga. At the age of fourteen, in the twentieth year of Tenbun (1551), he first donned armor. In this year, there was the Battle of Kaizu in Owari, where Nobunaga and his uncle Tsuda Yasaburō Inobu, both generals under his command, advanced toward Kiyosu, setting fires and fighting in various places. At this time, His Excellency of the First Rank 《This refers to Lord Toshiie, recorded as "His Excellency of the First Rank"》belonged to the forces under command and was stationed at the main camp, but he charged out ahead of the banner men and achieved distinguished service. Both generals were deeply impressed and praised his martial valor. Yasaburō Inobu, as his eboshi-ko (ceremonial father), granted him one character from his name, and thus he came of age and took the name Maeda Magoshirō Toshiie.

Upon examination, the compiler of the above military achievement record is not clear. Was this truly a factual record of that era?

Recording from Murai Nagaaki's Jinzen-roku as follows:
1. His Excellency the Dainagon often spoke of this, even when reading to his close attendants who served him: when he began service to Lord Nobunaga at the age of fourteen, he was initially granted fifty kan, later increased to 150 kan, and after distinguished service at the Battle of Moribe, he received further increases. Later, he was granted his elder brother Lord Kuraudo's succession in Echizen, totaling 2,450 kan. Subsequently, he was granted 33,300 koku in Fuchu, Echizen, then the entire province of Noto, and later Ishikawa in Kaga Province

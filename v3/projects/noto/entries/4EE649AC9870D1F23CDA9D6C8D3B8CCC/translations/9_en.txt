The genealogy is a document that Arai Chikugo presented to Lord Bunsho, so its source is reliable and there should be no falsehoods, therefore I take it up now.

1. In Heiji's analysis, while the Nobunaga-ki, Oda Gunki, Oda-fu and other works record that military achievement, they do not record that 10,000 koku was granted as a reward. The Hankan-fu does not know its basis. Also, regarding these 10,000 koku being granted at Nagahama in Sakata District of Omi Province, Tomita Kageshu does not record the documentary evidence for this, and the proof is not detailed. The donated rice to Takefu Chikubushima Kaoo-in temple was a donation by the young lord Hosshun-in. In a rice collection calculation document held by Imazu Jinemon, dated the seventh month of Genna 8, with the seal of Lord Toshitsune and co-signed by the two chief retainers Honda and Yokoyama, it states "16 koku 5 to 5 sho, the portion that Hosshun-in-sama sends to Chikubushima every year, sent to Kaobo temple and others." Based on this, the personal note in Honpo Joji-ko is probably incorrect.

1. Copy of the certificate granting Noto Province

Furthermore, regarding the府中, your fortifications and the private residences of your subordinates, it is essential that they be transferred with careful attention and without any objection.

Regarding you, I appoint you to Noto Province and its holdings. As for the holdings dispatched to Echizen Province, I have appointed Sugaya Kuemon to handle this matter, so you should be aware of this. This year's military affairs shall be under your command. From next year onwards, it shall be transferred to you. Next, regarding your wife and children, you must quickly move them to that province. Do not be negligent. For this purpose, Kuemon will go to Echizen and arrive at the castle soon.

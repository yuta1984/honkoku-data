In Bunroku 2, [the temple] received a vermillion seal document from Lord Toshiie donating 100 hyō of land as lamp-lighting fields for Kannon. A copy of the donation document is as follows:

Regarding the Kannon lamp-lighting fields of Hōfuku Temple in Funami Village, Niikawa District
Since this is a matter reasoned by Kō-zōsu, we hereby donate 100 hyō of land from within this village. Therefore, it is as stated herein.
　Bunroku 2
　　5th month, 24th day　　Toshiie's seal
　　　Hōfuku Temple

Based on this donation document, it is clear that by Bunroku 2, Niikawa District was already within the Maeda family's domain. Examining this, one theory states that in Tenshō 15, [the district] was granted to heir Toshinaga for his military achievements in the Tsukushi campaign, which perhaps captures the truth. Alternatively, it is said that Niikawa District became our domain's custodial territory from Taikō after Sassa Narimasa's withdrawal. Therefore, in Keicho 5, 8th month, when Lord Toshinaga dispatched troops to the capital region and Lord Toshimasa, Noto Chamberlain, hesitated to deploy troops, Hijikata Kanbei Takehisa worked diligently under secret orders from Tokugawa Naifu. When Naifu wished to grant him territory, Lord Toshinaga said, "I shall give 10,000 koku from within Niikawa District, which is under our custody." That territory was immediately conveyed as ordered, and Lord Toshinaga granted 10,000 koku in the area of Nunoshi in Niikawa District, but later it was exchanged with villages of the four Noto districts, as recorded in memoranda from Lord Toshinaga's era. According to these old records, it remained our domain's custodial territory until Keicho 5. However, in the 6th month of the same 10th year, Lord Toshinaga transferred the three provinces of Kaga, Noto, and [the three districts of] Etchu to heir Toshi-

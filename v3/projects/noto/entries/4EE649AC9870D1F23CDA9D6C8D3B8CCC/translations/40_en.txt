[sent] as messengers [with the message]: "Earthquake shelters and such things should be built as lightly as possible and without error... Magoshirō is the lord of a province, so in matters where he should apply himself seriously, military arts are hardly discussed at all, and every day it's falconry or poetry and shamisen music. Today in Japan, lords of single provinces like Magoshirō are one of sixty-six, yet his conduct in all matters is improper and beyond criticism." This was His Lordship's opinion.

Yuasa Shinryō states: Examining the Toyotomi genealogy, the Fushimi earthquake occurred in the intercalary seventh month of Keichō 1. The hot spring visit to Kusatsu is recorded in the chronology as Keichō 3, fifth month. Based on this, it appears the province was privately granted at the end of Bunroku and officially received in Keichō 3. The character "ya" (弥) should be pondered... Heiji's examination: Does this theory capture the truth? There exist documents from the family records of Maeda Naoyuki, descendant of Lord Toshimasa, which I immediately investigated, but without definitive proof. The late friend Shibano Yoshihiro said that a jointly signed letter from our domain founder Lord Toshiie and Lord Toshimasa from Keichō 2 is currently preserved at a certain location. Based on this letter, around Keichō 2 it was still a private allocation.

A copy of the aforementioned jointly signed letter is as follows:
Regarding the monks and temple followers stationed as caretakers at the storehouse in Fuchū, as this contributes to maintaining the accumulated [religious] practices as before, they should continue coming and going as previously. If there are any who act contrary to this, strict orders shall be given.

This is indeed the case. The year before the Siege of Osaka was to begin, when Lord Hideyori sent word requesting that they become his allies, [Toshinaga] replied that while he was grateful as one who had been elevated by the Taiko, since Toshinaga was related to the Naifu (Tokugawa Ieyasu), his intentions were difficult to determine. With this response, he sent most of his retainers back to Kanazawa, and taking personal guard duty upon himself, he passed away.

The long prosperity of the Maeda family and the peace of the people of the three provinces of Kaga, Noto, and Etchu is due to the excellent governance of the domain founder Lord Toshiie and Lord Toshinaga. To know one's position relative to others means to understand the superiority or inferiority between oneself and others. This is the essential point of military strategy, and both founding and maintaining a domain are based on this principle. Even for common people, when they understand this principle, they do not compete in wisdom or skills with those superior to themselves. Lord Toshinaga's taking of poison by his own hand was because he sacrificed his life thinking of the eternal future of his house. {{Note: The meaning of this passage is profound and should be carefully considered}}

1. On the 17th day of the 10th month of Keicho 5 (1600), Tokugawa Naifu rewarded Lord Toshinaga's military achievements by granting him the former territories of Niwa Nagashige of Komatsu - the Nomi District of Kaga Province and 40,000 koku of Mattō in Ishikawa District, the former territory of Yamaguchi Genba of Daishōji - the Enuma District of Kaga, and the former territory of Lord Toshimasa - the four districts of Noto Province. Thus, the Maeda came to hold all three provinces of Kaga, Noto, and Etchu.

The Honchō Tsūkan states: "In the 10th month of Keicho 5, on the day of Hinoto-i, Maeda Toshinaga arrived in Osaka and had an audience with the Divine Lord (Ieyasu). The Divine Lord sent Sakakibara Yasumasa to his younger brother, rewarding this campaign's military achievements by additionally granting the two districts of Nomi and Enuma in Kaga Province totaling 200,000 koku, while reproaching Maeda Toshimasa for delaying with his troops, removing Noto Province [from Toshimasa] and granting it together to Toshinaga, who then returned to his domain. Initially, Toshiie held Etchu and Noto provinces plus two districts of Kaga, assigning Etchu to Toshinaga and Noto to Toshimasa, but at this time [Toshinaga] came to hold all three provinces."

When Lord Toshiie granted Noto Province to Magoshirō-sama (Toshimasa), there was a request to also grant Murai Bungo as a retainer, but the response was "That cannot be done, but I will grant you Okumura Iemon." Formally, Saitō Gyōbu and Okada Chōzaemon were sent as messengers to make this petition, while privately, the mother spoke about this matter... (abbreviated below)

After Magoshirō-sama received Noto Province at Fushimi, Murai Bungo and Okumura Iemon were each given two kosode robes at year's end. Bungo was particularly given long hakama and formal attire in addition. This was said to be the lord's private consideration. Furthermore, Tokuyama Gohē, Saitō Gyōbu, Teranishi Sōemon, Kamiya Shinano, Okumura Kazue, and Murai Kanjūrō were each given one kosode robe.

Everyone admired Magoshirō-sama. First was the matter of Emori Heizaemon - there were circumstances, and the Dainagon (Toshiie) showed consideration. Through Murai Bungo as messenger, privately to Magoshirō: "There is no one else to send Heizaemon to, and moreover, given his advanced age, I feel sympathy for him. Please keep him as a conversation partner for Magoshirō-sama." While he held a 600-koku stipend in Kanazawa, he was granted 1,000 koku in Noto and employed. Subsequently, Niwa Gonsuke, Koizumi Magoichirō, Iguchi Gihē, Kuri Kyūbē, Nakarai [blank], and Daidōji Shinshirō - all received the lord's consideration or due to insufficient stipends, and all were granted small increases and maintained in service. Both senior retainers and lower-ranking retainers praised Lord Toshimasa.

After the great earthquake at Fushimi, Magoshirō-sama personally entertained the lord in a temporary shelter. The particularly fine construction of the temporary shelter was praised by the lord upon his return, and Okada Chōzaemon and Saitō Gyōbu were [sent as messengers].

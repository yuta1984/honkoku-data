When there was a battle with Musashi-no-kami Nobuyuki, Toshiie cut off two heads and was shot in the face by Nobuyuki's retainer Miyai Kanbe-no-jo, but in the end he took Miyai's head and appeared before Nobunaga. The admiration was not shallow, and he was immediately granted additional territory of 3,000 koku. His elder brother Kuraudo Toshihisa was to be the heir, but by order he changed his name to Matazaemon-no-jo. In the ninth month of Genki 1 (1570), during the battle at Osaka in Settsu Province, when our allies were thoroughly defeated, Toshiie alone held firm, broke through the pursuing enemies and returned.

The Honpo Joji-ko states: In the ninth month of Genki 1, he was granted additional territory at Nagahama within Sakata District of Omi Province, and came to hold a total of 10,000 koku including his previous holdings. A personal note states: At this time it appears as a donation, with 3 to 5 sho of assessed rice to Kaoo-in temple on Chikubu Island in the same district, with actual collection of 3 sho 3 go 5 shaku, and this precedent continues today. The Hankan-fu mentions 10,000 koku... In my humble opinion, while Nagaaki's records describe this spear achievement as the "peerless spear of Japan," and both Toda Musashi-no-kami and Tsubouchi Heita relate this story, there is no clear mention of being granted 10,000 koku, however the Hankan-

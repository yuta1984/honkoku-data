A fire broke out from a small house at Fujizuka, and the entire residence compound was consumed by the spreading flames. [The family] took residence in the mansions of Lord Toshitsune and Lord Toshinao, and in the following 4th year, construction of the Kanda residence was completed, and they relocated there on the 21st day of the 8th month.

Upon examination, the "Sanshū-shi" refers to it as the Kanda residence. Presumably, the Hongō and Kanda [residences] are the same estate.

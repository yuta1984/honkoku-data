　　October 2nd　　Nobunaga　Red seal
　　　　Lord Maeda Matazaemon

1. According to the Etoku Zasshi, the secretary was Kusunoki Choan. According to the Honpo Joji-ko, Kusunoki Choan was an eleventh-generation descendant of Kusunoki Masashige who served Lord Nobunaga. He was initially called Junior Fourth Rank Lower Kawachi-no-kami Masatora, and later became a monk and took the title Shikibu-kyo Hoin Choan.

1. In my analysis, the old domain records all relate to Tensho 8 or 9. One theory suggests it was the 6th year, Boshin. The Kanto Kaikoku Shi Tosho states: "The exact year of entry into Noto Province is uncertain and is based on the oral traditions of elders." The Kanei Keizu-den does not record the year and month, perhaps because there are no ancient traditions.

Since then there has been no correspondence for a long time, so I shall visit you tomorrow to make this request. I will undertake any appropriate duties. I will explain the details in person. With great respect and humble words.
　　12th month, 3rd day　　　　Mae Matazaemon Toshiie　Signature
　　　　Seishinbo
　　　　　To all fellow residents

This is owned by Seikibo, the chief priest (betto) of Sugawara Shrine in Sugawara Village, Hakui District. In my analysis, this may be a letter sent during the time when the domain founder entered his granted territory during the Tensho era.

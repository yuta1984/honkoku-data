should be considered. Also, at this time the heir moved from Mattō Castle in Kaga Province to Moriyama in Etchu and governed the three districts of Etchu. The seal document transmitted by the Kato family is as follows:

From within Oshimizu and Kahoku District of Kaga Province, six thousand hyō are commanded to be supported. These shall fully be held in fief. Therefore as stated herein.

According to the above seal document, although at this time the heir received and governed the three districts of Tonami, Imizu, and Nei in Etchu Province, did he still hold Kahoku District of Kaga Province and Oshimizu-shō of Hakui District in Noto Province as territorial divisions? This requires further investigation.

One, in the 6th month of Tensho 15, Sassa Narimasa was granted Higo Province, his former domain of Niikawa District in Etchu Province became the Maeda family's stewardship, and later it was granted so that all of Etchu Province became part of their fief. However, copies of the certificates of enfeoffment are not recorded in the old domain records.

According to Murai Nagaaki's "Chinzen-roku":
One, at the time when the Kampaku's [Hideyoshi's] life came to an end, by the Taikō's intention: "From now on, we must rely entirely on the Dainagon [Maeda Toshiie] as protector of Hideyori. The three provinces of Mino, Owari, and Ise, former domains of Hideugu, should be given to Toshiie." When this intention was conveyed, Ishida Jibu-shōsuke, Masuda Uemon-no-jō and others, having heard this, said: "Since relations between the Dainagon and [others] have been frequently bad, those leaders stated: 'Toshiie is presently a warrior without peer. Moreover, he is one who makes people submit to him, so naturally he might commit rebellion...'"

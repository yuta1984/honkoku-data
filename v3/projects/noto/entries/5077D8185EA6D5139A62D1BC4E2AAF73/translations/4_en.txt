○In the battle of Kurotani in Enuma District, when General Shibata Sanzaemon attacked, I was the first to charge and crossed spears with the enemy, but I was severely wounded and retreated. The witness to my first spear charge was a man named Ikeda Yazaemon. Besides this, I fought in various places including Hasatani, Ishitōga battles, battles during the retreat to Hakusan during the Ishikawa uprising, and the Echū Gofukuyama battle, though only in minor skirmishes. Since I have grown old and my memory of events has become confused, I will not record them. This document may also contain some chronological confusion. The above.

○During the battle of Hinoya in Enuma District, the enemy Yoshida Sakon held Hinoya Castle. The entire forces of Kaga Province pressed the attack, but our side was weak at that time and retreated. Hori Saizō and I counterattacked together, and I took one head under spear point. The witness is a man named Ikeda Yazaemon, who is said to still reside in this area.

○During the battle of Awazu in Nomi District, the lord of Miyukizuka Castle was Sakuma Gemba,

nephew of Lord Shibata Shuri. Our side moved to a castle at a place called Hasatani, where Tamba, Kishida Shinshirō, and Sambayashi Zenshirō (two or three men) were stationed as guards when the enemy attacked. When we charged out from the castle, the enemy forces drove back our allies, but I alone counterattacked and broke through the enemy lines. The enemy I defeated was Lord Kondō Mondo, uncle of Lord Matsudaira Hōki. That day I counterattacked twice and engaged with spears at two locations, breaking through both times. Lord Hōki is aware of this.

○During the battle at the Ozaka entrance in Kanazawa, Lord Shibata Shuri led the enemy attack, and the castle lord was a man named Shimozuma Juhō. A man named Sambayashi Zenshirō, whom I had requested, was defending the main gate at Ozaka. When the enemy pressed toward the gate, I charged out first, and from the enemy side, a man identifying himself as Kajita Shingo, a retainer of Lord Oda Shichirō, crossed spears with me. I struck down Shingo, but there was a dispute over the kill with Sambayashi Kyūzō, my lord's younger brother, who was sixteen years old and still young. As a reward for that achievement, Kyūzō was given ten kan of silver certificates.

○The Kaga forces were constructing a castle at Tokumitsu, but before it was completed, Shibata's forces attacked. However, due to the scheming of Suzuki Dewa of Yamauchi, Tokumitsu suffered defeat.

○When Kamigata forces pressed toward Hasatani, which was Fujimaru's residential castle, Hori Kyūbei (who at this time was serving Mitsubayashi at Ōsugi) went to Hasatani for inspection. Finding that Fujimaru's forces were in poor condition and virtually empty-handed, Kyūbei also cut his way out, routed the Kamigata forces, and withdrew. This was because Fujimaru and Mitsubayashi were on friendly terms.

1. The Circumstances of Lord Hatakeyama, the Nōshū Palace Lord
Yoshinori, the eldest son of Shuri-no-dayū Fukutane, was dissolute in his behavior and cast his eyes upon women who belonged to others, wantonly earning the resentment of the entire household. At that time, Yusa Mimasaka-no-kami had contracted to marry the daughter of Chō Tsushima-no-kami and was about to welcome her when Yoshinori seized her for himself. Although Yusa had no choice in the matter, Chō Tsushima-no-kami and his eldest son Kurōzaemon, both father and son, harbored resentment toward the palace lord.

However, when Yoshitaka died of illness at twenty-some years, his younger brother called Honmatsu-dono was again installed and revered as palace lord. Then Kenshin of Echigo led a large force to attack Kaburaki Uemon, the castle lord of Mattō in Kaga. However, the castle defenders were strong and he could not take it, but the defenders, weary of the large attacking force, finally surrendered. Afterwards, Kaburaki became Kenshin's vanguard and attacked Nanao castle in Nōshū. With a force of over ten thousand, from the 20th day of the 11th month until the 8th day of the 4th month of the following year, they attacked using various methods, but the castle defenders were strong and showed no sign of falling, so they withdrew to Echigo. In the 7th month of the same year, they again set out from Echigo to attack Nanao. At this time, Yusa Mimasaku-no-kami, through his father-in-law Chō,

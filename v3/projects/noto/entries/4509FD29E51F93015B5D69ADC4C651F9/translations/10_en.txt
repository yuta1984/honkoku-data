1. On the 20th day of the 6th month of Kan'ei 16 (1639), Lord Toshitsune retired and transferred 800,000 koku from the three provinces of Kaga, Etchu, and Noto to his heir (Mitsutaka), 100,000 koku to his second son Lord Tositsugu, and 70,000 koku to his third son Lord Tosiharu. He made 222,760 koku from Nomi District in Kaga and Niikawa District in Etchu his retirement domain and resided in Komatsu Castle.

A copy of Lord Toshitsune's personal letter to Karō Honda Yokoyama Nishi is as follows:

"Today on the 20th, Chikuzen-no-kami (Mitsutaka) was summoned to the castle, and the private petition was settled before His Lordship. Although I am still young in years and this is presumptuous of me, I have been continuously petitioning since the time of Taitoku-in-sama (the second shogun Hidetada). Moreover, as I have recently fallen ill, if you would graciously grant a postponement, I thought you might be concerned, so for the sake of my health, I have respectfully submitted this request as a direct appeal to Your Lordship.

I am most grateful and honored by this matter. Chikuzen-no-kami has been granted a fief of 800,000 koku, Awaji-no-kami (Tositsugu) 100,000 koku, Hida-no-kami (Tosiharu) 70,000 koku, with the remainder appointed as my retirement portion. I, Chikuzen-no-kami, have also been ordered to reside in Edo. Therefore, of the 190,000 koku that was Hizen-no-kami-dono's (Toshitsune's) retirement portion, 170,000 koku has been granted to Awaji-no-kami and Hida-no-kami. As for myself, if I were to remain in the former Hizen-no-kami-dono's retirement domain, I could reside there regardless of fief income, but since it is intended that generations serve in Edo residence, when I inquired whether retirement fief income would be granted, the above was decreed. This matter should be communicated to the retainers and unit commanders. Respectfully,

6th month, 20th day                    Hizen"

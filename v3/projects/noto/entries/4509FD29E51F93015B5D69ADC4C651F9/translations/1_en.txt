1. Regarding the military achievements of our domain's warriors in the siege of Osaka Castle being rewarded with an increase in domain territory, a copy of Lord Ieyasu's official document is as follows:

This time, Hideyori plotted rebellion and attempted to win over various provinces, but [we] did not join his cause. On the fourth day of the last month of last year, during the assault on Sanada-maru, many retainers of our house were killed in action. However, on the seventh day of the fifth month of the following year, we achieved victory in an incomparable battle at Okayamaguchi and caused Osaka to fall. The military achievements involving utmost devotion are beyond measure.

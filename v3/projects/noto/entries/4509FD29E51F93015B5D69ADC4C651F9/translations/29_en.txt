When the mother called Hōshun-in was brought to serve the Tokugawa lord, Yamato-no-kami Toshitaka, being extremely devoted to his mother's affection, brought her along when he went down to the Kantō region. After the Battle of Sekigahara ended, when Lord Toshinaga was granted additional territories of Kaga and Noto, the mother was also granted land worth 10,000 koku. Furthermore, for his merit in pacifying the Hokuriku region together with Hijikata Kawachi-no-kami, he was granted 10,000 koku of land at Nanukamachi in Kōzuke Province. At this time, since the elderly mother was in the Kantō region, for her convenience, Toshinaga arranged to exchange Hijikata's territory with land in Kaga, making Nanukamachi the domain of Hōshun-in. Therefore, it was transmitted from Hōshun-in to Yamato-no-kami Toshitaka.

1. In this writer Heiji's opinion, although Aochi's genealogical summary of the main domain does not record the birth mother, the other Maeda genealogies that identify the birth mother as Hōshun-in are incorrect. The theory handed down in the Hankan-fu has some merit, but it contradicts the actual records. It is probably a misunderstanding by later people.

Hijikata Family's Portion

10,000 koku from within Kikuta District in Mutsu Province, and 10,000 koku from within the four districts of Hakui, Hōsu, Suzu, and Noto in Noto Province, totaling 20,000 koku. {{Marginal note: Catalog is on separate paper}}

Since Kumagaya Hansuke of the page corps came for this purpose, Okumura Iki Tsunenori was dispatched to Edo as a gesture of gratitude. The announcement letter reads:

I write to inform you of the following. It brings the utmost joy to learn that His Lordship the Kubō continues in excellent spirits. Regarding the judgment document for my territory bestowed on the 21st, the said Ōkura-dayū attended the castle, received it in His Presence, and came immediately. We humbly and gratefully received it, considering it a most fortunate occasion. In gratitude for this, we are sending Okumura Iki, so please kindly present him properly.

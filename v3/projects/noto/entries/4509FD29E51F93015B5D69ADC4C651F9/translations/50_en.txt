It appears that the current Maeda family follows Shintoism, and next year in April they will conduct a three-hundred-year festival at Oyama Shrine in Kanazawa, having abolished the Buddhist memorial services.

In remembrance of three hundred years of national benevolence, I have compiled this "Study of the Feudal Domain" to express my modest aspirations.

113,400+ koku - Lord Matsudaira Awaji-no-kami's domain
70,900+ koku - Lord Matsudaira Hida-no-kami's domain
243,500+ koku - Lord Matsudaira Hizen-no-kami's domain
13,500+ koku - Lord Hijikata Kawachi-no-kami's domain
Total: 1,244,700+ koku

The koku assessments of the above domains have varied in number since around Shōhō 3.

1. It is thought that at this time there may have been records submitted to the shogunate without distinction in the red-seal koku assessments. Previously, the koku amount in the judgment document granted by the third shogun in Kan'ei 11 was 1,192,760 koku, which corresponds to this correct number. There may have been additional koku granted by Shōhō as well. This cannot be verified today. The correct number from Kan'ei 11 has remained unchanged to the present.

1. Following the death of Lord Toshitsune in the tenth month of Manji 1, on the twenty-eighth day of the intercalary twelfth month of the same year, there was an imperial command that the fifth lord, Tsunanori, should be granted Lord Toshitsune's retirement domains of Nomi and Niikawa districts totaling over 220,000 koku, along with Komatsu Castle.

The "Kanke Kenbun-shū" and others record it as follows:
1. On the twenty-eighth day of the intercalary twelfth month of Manji 1, when Sasachūjō Tsunatoshi-kyō (Tsunanori) went to the castle, the shogun personally declared that he should manage in detail his grandfather Toshitsune's retirement domain of 220,000 koku along with Komatsu Castle as had been done previously. As thanks, he presented 300 pieces of white silver for horse expenses and 200 bundles of cotton. For Komatsu Castle, various retainers from Kanazawa served in rotation, with Yokoyama Saemon serving as castle commander.

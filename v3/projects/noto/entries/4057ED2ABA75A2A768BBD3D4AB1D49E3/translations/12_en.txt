1. In the same village, there is an ancient stone called "Ichinichibi no Ishi" (Market Day Stone). It is said that this place was once a post town along a highway. The stone still remains today, but the characters for "market day" are no longer visible.

1. In the territory of Nanpo Village, there is a Kannon Hall. It is said that a seven-hall temple complex was built here in Daido 2 (807 CE). Now only the site of the residence remains, and the locals call this place "Shimizu" (Clear Water).

1. In the territory of Miyazaki Village, there is a sacred forest called Miyabayashi. It is said to be dedicated to Kashima Daimyojin, and inside the hall there are four wooden statues, collectively called Miyazaki Daimyojin. Regarding these wooden statues, it is said that long ago, there was a place called "Oki no Shima" (Offshore Island) in the sea about 17-18 cho from the village. The wooden statue of Kashima Daimyojin was transferred from this island to Miyazaki Village, where a large shrine was built and granted a domain of 50 koku. There were ancient documents about this, but they were lost in a fire, so only oral traditions remain and nothing certain is known. Also, there are castle ruins in the mountains within the village territory, but there are no traditions about who lived there, and it has now become a brushwood mountain.

The above records the origins and traditions from within Niikawa District.

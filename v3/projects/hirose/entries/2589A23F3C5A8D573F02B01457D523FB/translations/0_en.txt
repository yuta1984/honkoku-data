【Map Title】Osaka Past and Present: Four Great Fires

【Below Title】
Everyone knows the horror of fires, but while it was understandable in the old days when fire prevention systems were inadequate, it is a mistake to feel secure today thinking that fires will never become large because we now have water systems and steam pumps. Once the wind becomes fierce and water supply fails, great disasters like this recent one can occur. We must never be careless and should exercise the utmost caution in handling fire. Here we compare the great fires of past and present, recording the tragic conditions of these terrible conflagrations as a guide for future generations.

The Great Tenma Fire of Meiji 42 (1909)
On July 31, Meiji 42 at around 3:30 AM, a fire broke out at Tamada, a knitted goods manufacturer on the west side of Tenmabashi-suji in Utsushin-chō 2-chōme, North Ward, Osaka City. A great northeastern gale happened to be blowing, and the midsummer heat wave had continued, leaving everything completely dried out, creating an uncontrollable situation. In no time, the nearby Matsugae Elementary School was consumed, and the fire spread southwest. Even the Horikawa, which was the primary firebreak, could not contain it. The fire became increasingly fierce, burning Dōjima area to the south, Sonezaki and Umeda areas to the north, extending to upper and lower Fukushima, finally being extinguished around 5:40 AM on August 1st. The fire extended about 1.5 ri in length and over 10 chō in width. The damage was as follows:

Districts: Over 100 / Bridges: 13 locations / Houses: Over 12,000 / Theaters: 5 locations / Schools: 8 locations / Shrines and temples: 20 locations
The entire 4th Division engaged in firefighting, with fire brigades from Kyoto, Kobe, and Tokyo providing assistance, totaling about 5,000 personnel.
Total damage: Approximately 100 million yen

The Great Fire of Kyōhō 9 (1724)
On March 31, Kyōhō 9 (186 years ago) at half past the ninth hour of the day, fire broke out from the house of Kanaya Myōchi in Minami-Horie Tachibana-dōri 2-chōme. Strong southern winds carried the fire to Shinmachi and eventually burned through to Kitano. To the west it reached Amida Pond, to the east it was contained around Momenbashi, then continued north along Nishi-Yokobori, spreading to the north side of Hakurō-chō, from where all of Senba was consumed. Fire also jumped to Tenma, reaching Kawasaki, with all of Nakanoshima, Dōjima, and Nishi-Tenma burning completely. On the morning of the 22nd, northeast winds carried sparks to Uemachi, and as north winds intensified, all of Uemachi was engulfed, then spreading to Kōzu, all of Shimanochi, then jumping to the Dōtonbori theaters, with multiple fire fronts developing, completely consuming Namba Shinchi and Naga-chō. Of Osaka's 480-some districts, over 430 were affected—truly Osaka's greatest fire ever, separating parents from children and siblings from each other, with people fleeing not only to the five home provinces but to Tanba, Tango, Iga, Ise, Gōshū, Harima, Awaji and other provinces. Their suffering was truly indescribable.

Households: 98,700+ / Storehouses: 2,800+ / Deaths: Approximately 30,000+ / Injured: 120,000+

The Great Fire of Tenpō 8 (1837)
On February 19, Tenpō 8 (73 years ago) at the fifth hour of morning, fire broke out from Tenma with strong winds carrying it to various places, burning up to the castle area of Uemachi. Major houses in North Senba and Chōja-machi were consumed in various locations, extending south to Honmachi. However, at the fire scene, suspicious figures of unknown identity rampaged through Osaka city, creating indescribable chaos among the people. Consequently, people fled to rural areas throughout the provinces like scattered spider offspring, and throughout Japan at that time there was talk only of this great fire. It was truly an unprecedented great fire and great disturbance.

Districts: 112 / Households: 18,578 / Storehouses: 411 locations / Underground storage: 130 locations / Temples and shrines: 36 locations / Deaths and injuries: Countless

The Great Fire of Bunkyū 3 (1863)
On November 21, Bunkyū 3 (47 years ago) at the fifth hour of night, fire broke out from the area north of Shinmachi Bridge. Strong western winds carried it rapidly eastward, then northwest winds shifted it toward the southeast. The wind then changed to southwest, driving the fire fiercely toward the northeast, then jumping to Uemachi where the fire became increasingly intense. Both Senba and Uemachi burst into flames simultaneously, making it appear as if all of Osaka had become fire. The terror of old and young, men and women, was truly beyond description. Finally it burned to the eastern edge of Osaka. One can imagine the chaos throughout Osaka city. The fire was extinguished at the fourth hour of day on the 23rd of the same month.

Districts: 152 / Households: 25,000+ / Storehouses: 320+ / Religious buildings: 80+ / Deaths: 46 people / Injured: Countless

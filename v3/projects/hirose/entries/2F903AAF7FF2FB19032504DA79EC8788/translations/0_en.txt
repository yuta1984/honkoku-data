Here, on the night of the second day of the tenth month of Ansei 2 (1855), there was a great earthquake, and countless houses collapsed and storehouses crumbled, with many people dying. Among them, those who escaped unharmed and were saved from mortal peril were helped by Ise Daijingu (Grand Shrine of Ise).

The reason is that at that time, the sacred horse galloped around Edo, apparently saving the faithful believers. When people heard that horse hair from the divine horse was found in the sleeves of the clothing of those who were saved, these people examined their clothes and indeed found horse hair. This is surely proof that the Great Divine Spirit protected them, and so on.

"Now that the deity has appeared, we cannot match them. Quickly flee, flee!"

"Ah, it hurts, it hurts! I won't come out anymore. Forgive me, forgive me!"

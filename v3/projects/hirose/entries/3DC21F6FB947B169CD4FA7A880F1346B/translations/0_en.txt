The earthquake that occurred after 6 AM on October 28th, Meiji 24 (1891), caused particularly violent shaking in the Gifu, Nagoya, and Ogaki regions. There were tremendous landslides, all houses collapsed completely, and the number of deaths may reach tens of thousands. Children as young as two or three years old were left alone after being separated from their parents and spouses, clinging to their dead parents and crying out—a pitiable sight too painful to witness. Rescue operations were immediately dispatched to various locations, and medical treatment was provided to the injured. This can truly be called a great earthquake unprecedented in history.

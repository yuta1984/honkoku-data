The Course of the Tsunami
The following 5th day
On the 11th month, 5th day, at the seventh hour of the day (around 4 PM), a great earthquake occurred, and from somewhere came a thunderous roar as if ten million lightning bolts were striking, causing everyone great fear and wonder. From evening onward, a great tsunami over two jo high (about 6 meters) came rushing in. Large and small ships alike were swept up by the tsunami, some were smashed to pieces, and others were pushed up into inner rivers. The masts of large ships knocked down bridge after bridge, and over 1,500 large ships were pushed up from Dotonbori River to Daikoku Bridge. Ships were piled two and three layers deep on top of each other, like turtle shells laid out to dry. Most pitiable among all this were the people of various districts who, terrified by the recent earthquakes, regardless of age, gender, or social status, had fled in panic to tea boats, sword-tip boats, house boats, or thirty-koku cargo boats, thinking they would be safe from the shaking and crushing. But alas, in an instant the tsunami struck, and boats and all were overturned to the bottom of the water. The cries echoed throughout all of Osaka, truly the most pitiful sight that one could not bear to witness. Additionally, people from the western areas fled toward Uemachi like scattered baby spiders, their numbers beyond count.

Besides these, approximately 600 more vessels were smashed to pieces or half-broken.

**[Earthquake Preparedness Guidelines]**
When you notice an earthquake, place metal basins on top of braziers, hang earthenware pots filled with water, take out books and precious items, and lay tatami mats or boards on the streets for safety. When there's no time, hide behind furniture like chests. Never flee by boat. After earthquakes, tsunamis always follow. Be careful with lighting fires, prepare flint and steel along with lanterns and oil lamps, place earthenware vessels low, and ensure fires don't go out. For food preparation and supplies, install supports between facing eaves using logs. Corner houses are dangerous; middle houses may become diamond-shaped but are not as dangerous. Even if collapsed, don't go outside but fold inward. When fleeing to main streets, never go near corner houses. Tatami laying is for mud water spurts and ground cracks. Praying at temples and shrines is the height of carelessness. In any case, water and fire prevention are most important.

However, when an earthquake starts shaking, if shoji screens and sliding doors haven't come off, there's no worry of the house collapsing. If you flee outside, prepare war hats or head coverings, parasols, hand towels, multiple layers of clothing, and protection from falling roof tiles.

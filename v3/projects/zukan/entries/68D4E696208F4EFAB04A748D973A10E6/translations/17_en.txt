Since these flower forms have lost their natural characteristics, even I find them difficult to explain and worry about this. Therefore, if there are those who view this work, they will surely only mock it and give it no credence. If you have doubts, please take the actual blooming at Araoka as evidence. Though they are all hanashōbu, the differences between them are as vast as clouds and mud. This is like having qilin and phoenix among birds and beasts, or comparing a temporary puddle with great rivers and seas.

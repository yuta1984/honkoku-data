Even when the leaves turn yellow, if cultivation is skillful and the plants are strong,
they do not wilt or become emaciated, and even without flowers they are
worth viewing. Now, when seedlings first bloom, occasionally double and multiple-layered flower
forms appear, but when they bloom the following summer as three-year plants,
the flower forms become disordered and lose their initial appearance. In iris (ayame),
there are multiple-layered flower forms that remain unchanged
year after year, but although they are related plants, hanashōbu rarely
displays such forms, and even when it does, they are not perfect forms. Last
summer, I selected flowers containing double forms among the first-blooming seedlings
and cultivated many of them, and when I observed those that bloomed the following summer,
only one plant had a flower form ten times more elaborate, with unprecedented petals
in full bloom. For over sixty years I have been captivated by this flower form, and
finally my wish has been fulfilled. Ah, has human effort merged with the creative force of nature? At last
a remarkable variety has emerged. Looking back again, if I had not neglected
seedling cultivation for decades, there would have been things I could not have achieved
even up to now, but ultimately due to my dullness and poor observation,
it was difficult to determine, and many varieties that appeared with great effort
probably withered away as they were, which I regret and lament.
However, this too is perhaps due to my deep affection causing infatuation
and speculation. In chrysanthemums, which have quite different plant characteristics,

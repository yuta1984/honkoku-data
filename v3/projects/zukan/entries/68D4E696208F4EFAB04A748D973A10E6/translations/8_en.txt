was granted the honor of His Imperial attention. This must be one reward for
loving flowers for many years - I am overwhelmed with both reverence and joy. After being transferred in the summer of the Tenpō era
and coming to this place, I walk with a cane, my body weakened by age,
so I resigned from public duties, withdrew from the world into seclusion, devoting my heart and body to a hundred flowers,
especially one variety of hanashōbu which I have
continuously cultivated since long ago, so even now I
cherish it, and year after year the excellent specimens that grow

Two parts, three parts of red clay sifted to about the size of azuki beans, mix these three materials evenly without lumps, and furthermore add plenty of red clay pieces about the size of a thumb tip to the bottom of the pot. Although consideration depends on the size of the pot, if using what is commonly called an "oyatsubatori" vessel, plant three clumps with the front of the grass facing outward, gather them toward the center maintaining balance, add dry soil lightly to an appropriate level, pull out so the roots don't tangle and form a natural, protruding shape, then plant shallowly. With the soil as is, only shake and move the pot to pack the soil, water with a watering can, then bury the pot up to the rim in soil. From before the winter solstice,

gather fallen leaves into the pot as frost protection. Also, large drainage holes at the bottom of the pot are preferable. Use coarse soil primarily, and adding plenty of coarse red clay to the pot bottom prevents water from accumulating. Generally, with potted plants, if there is heavy rain within a day or two after planting, moisture lingers indefinitely, causing water rot and damaging the root system. Unlike ground planting, careful cultivation attention is required or propagation becomes difficult. Previously, grasses that failed when planted in pots without drainage, or grasses grown in land commonly called "araki," when transplanted to black soil land commonly called "nodo"

I also conducted seed cultivation. It was the same species as the plant from Iyo Province. Therefore,
regarding what is called hanashōbu in various provinces, the
explanations are not all uniform. Now, roughly speaking, citing one or two examples: what is
called hanashōbu in various places in Shinshū Province resembles the hanashōbu of Asaka-numa,
growing in fields and plains, with short stature and reddish-purple
three-petaled small flowers of inferior quality that bloom, and it is not an aquatic plant. The
hanashōbu of Asaka-numa is true hanashōbu that
grows in marshes. Or perhaps it is an aquatic plant called hasen'en that resembles Chinese lantern plant,
with the name "katsumi," but it seems to have no flowers, so it is probably
a different species altogether. Looking at the plant that was said to have been obtained by petition to the lord of the marsh,

it appears to be keison or hime-ayame or baran
varieties, and since it is not a single variety, perhaps this too is called hanashōbu because it
grows in marshes. One of my retainers has
relatives in Ōshū, and when I cultivated in my garden what he sent,
saying it was hanashōbu from that marsh, inferior keison flowers
bloomed. What was sent from a certain monk at Myōō-in temple,
claiming to be hanakatsumi from the Mimosuso River in Ise Province, was keison
in terms of the plant, but it was tall in stature, and the flowers were large-bloomed versions of ordinary keison.
What I obtained from a man called Bashi Shōshichi who lived in Sarumachi,
claiming it was hanashōbu from Satsuma Province, was hanashōbu

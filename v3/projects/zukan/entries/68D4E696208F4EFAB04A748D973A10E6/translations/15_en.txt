Although it may not be appropriate to compare with chrysanthemums, did the flower form called "oribako" not exist in ancient times? In the autumn when a seller from Ise Province brought a small-flowered purple chrysanthemum with oribako characteristics called "Shinko," when that flower first bloomed—even though no seeds had been sown—that same autumn the oribako flower form appeared for the first time in seedling gardens everywhere, and it has continued unbroken since then. Recalling what an elderly hermit named Baryū, who was celebrated as the patriarch of chrysanthemum cultivation, told me during the Kansei era, perhaps the time had come for that flower form to manifest. If so, then in hanashōbu as well, the double and multiple-layered flower forms should appear in seedling gardens everywhere. Moreover, since the three-petaled and six-petaled flower forms are the original nature of hanashōbu, their flower forms are determined from the first blooming of seedlings, but for double and multiple-layered forms, the flower form is determined at three years of age. Those with six petals or more have doubled petals, so their appearance is quite gorgeous and worth seeing, but in terms of flower ranking, it is limited to three-petaled forms. However, since rare flowers have not appeared in recent years, the three-petaled and six-petaled flower forms have become familiar to the eye and no longer surprise us. When standing alongside three-petaled forms, though their flower ranking may be inferior, since they are flower forms unprecedented since ancient times, the double and multiple-layered flower forms are truly unprecedented rare varieties of all ages.

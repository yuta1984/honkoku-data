What is the difference between the incompetent and the incapable? Even when it comes to cultivation, shifting responsibility to climate and soil conditions while being careless is improper. Upon investigation, if the plant dislikes the climate and soil, cultivation would be impossible. Not understanding this difference is perhaps like dye that doesn't take properly to fabric, resulting in lack of affinity. In the past, when I was in Kyoto, I cultivated many seedlings, but there was no difference in flowering time. Hearing that I had this flower, people from various places begged for it, so I gave it away to provinces far and wide, but since there was no difference in seedling flowering, it is not a plant that dislikes climate and soil, but rather due to one's own careless cultivation.

For both flower bed planting and pot planting, when planting it is written that the front of the plant should face outward, but few people select the front and back of the plant when planting, and when mixed together randomly, the base of the clumps becomes tangled and overcrowded, so there are both thick and thin stems, resulting not only in flower stalks of varying lengths, but also flowers of different sizes, making the appearance unsightly. This type of plant all has single-sided roots and has a front and back, which people know, but being old and senile, even the diagrams I drew earlier represent old roots not worth writing about. It is puzzling that the timing for dividing roots and replanting differs between pot planting and flower bed planting.

There may be people who do this, but when cultivating in pots, since planting occurs after flowering, over-fertilization causes overcrowding and the plants become emaciated the following summer, making flowering difficult in severe cases. However, if using vessels commonly known as "parent containers," since it's two-stem planting, even if planted after flowering, they grow sufficiently fat and flower, though the number of flowers is few.

Insect Pests
From before the spring equinox, insects about the size of sesame seeds appear, with yellow wings and black spotted patterns on their backs. They hide in the rotted remains of withered leaves at the base of the clumps and climb up to the shoot tips around mid-morning to eat the tender leaves. By early summer,

they lay eggs on the vigorous leaves. When people approach, they scatter quickly and are difficult to observe clearly. Once they become mature insects, they can only be caught with bird lime, making them difficult to capture. When left alone, many become emaciated and eventually die and wither away. Sometimes they attach not only to iris but also to similar plants and devour them completely. However, when planting in areas where iris have never grown before, it is said that these insects do not appear for five or six years, but when many plants are cultivated, the insects appear sooner. Depending on the climate and soil, some areas are unaware of the troubles caused by these insects.

For several years now, I have been using fermented sardine bone water for cultivation, and there have been no cases where various flowers and plants failed to grow well. The preparation method involves using what is commonly called a four-to barrel (an empty sake barrel) or a large jar, adding approximately five to six sho of sardine bones, and filling it completely with water. In summer, after ten days, and in winter, after twenty days, the bones are removed while leaving the liquid. When cultivating, this concentrate is diluted with an appropriate amount of water. When there is no stored supply, fresh sardine bones can be boiled and used, which is even more effective than the fermented water. However, since it contains salt, there is a concern that iris leaves may turn yellow, but since this fertilizer is effective for various flowers and plants, I have added it as an appendix.

However, there may be variations depending on the local climate and soil conditions.

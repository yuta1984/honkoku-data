"Hanshu Commentary" states: Zhang Yan said that fruits with pits are called "ka" and fruits without pits are called "ra."
Ying Shao said that tree fruits are called "ka" and grass fruits are called "ra."

"Wamyō Ruijushō" states:
　　　Tachibana - "Kenmyōen" says tachibana has the fanqie pronunciation of "jumi," also called "golden robe"
　　　Japanese name: tachibana

"Wakan Sansai Zue," Mountain Fruits section, states:
　Tachibana (mikan) - fanqie of jumi - tachibana, commonly called mikan, Japanese name tachibana

　　　　　Clouds show five colors for celebration, two colors for rainbow, and
　　　　　red outside, yellow inside, neither flame nor mist, tachibana also has
　　　　　red outside and yellow inside, when split it has fragrant dew
　　　　　resembling rainbow clouds, so the character derives from rainbow

"Zhouli" says "tachibana transforms into trifoliate orange" - this is caused by local climate. There are fourteen varieties. 《Note: details of each variety omitted》

　　　Generally, citrus fruits like yuzu and tachibana have never existed north of Hakone
　　　When tachibana is planted experimentally in Tsugaru, it all transforms into trifoliate orange. The saying
　　　"Jiangnan tachibana becomes trifoliate orange when moved north" refers to differences
　　　in southern and northern soil conditions

"Nanfang Caomu Zhuang" states:
　Tachibana produces red fruit from flowers, the peel is fragrant and delicious. Since Emperor Wu of Han, at Jiaozhi there was
　one tachibana official with a rank of 200 shi responsible for tachibana tribute. During Wu's Huangwu period, Jiaozhi
　Prefect Shi Xie presented seventeen tachibana fruits on a single stem, which was considered auspicious, and all officials
　celebrated

The same book's commentary states:
　The Japanese name "tachibana" is a general term for citrus fruits. What is now simply called "tachibana" is packaged tachibana.
　Those used specifically as fruit, with peel used as medicine, are mikan. When the fruit ripens it becomes sweet as honey, hence
　the name. It's unknown when this name began. Calling citrus fruits "kan" is incorrect. Probably
　the varieties are extremely numerous, and both Japan and China
　did not distinguish them clearly in ancient times

"Nihon Shoki" states: In the 90th year of Emperor Suinin's reign, in spring, Tajimamori was commanded to go to Tokoyokuni to seek tokijiku no kagu no mi (eternal fragrant fruit). What we now call tachibana is this. In the 99th year, in spring, he obtained eight stalks of tokijiku no kagu no mi and returned.
Another book states: After the emperor had already passed away, Tajimamori went to the imperial tomb, wailed, and took his own life. Moved by his loyalty, the fragrant fruit was called Tajimana.

　　The so-called Tokoyokuni might be Silla. Tajimamori was the great-great-grandson of Prince Amenohiboko of Silla who first came during Emperor Suinin's reign. This is probably why he was sent.

In the 8th year of Tempyō under Emperor Shōmu, praising Prince Katsuragi's loyalty, he bestowed floating cup tachibana, decreeing: "Tachibana is the foremost among fruits, what people prefer. Its branches endure frost and snow, pass through cold and heat without withering, compete in brilliance with pearls and jade, surpass beauty when mixed with gold and silver. Therefore I bestow upon you the surname Tachibana no Sukune." The Tachibana surname began here.

　　Tachibana no Sukune refers to Lord Moroe. "Getsurei Kōgi" mentions bestowing tachibana to court officials on the 2nd day of the 1st month,
　　anciently tachibana has been considered an auspicious fruit, this is today's packaged tachibana (tachibana). It's a separate variety.

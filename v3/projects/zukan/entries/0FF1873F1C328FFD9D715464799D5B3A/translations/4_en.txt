According to "Honzō Ikka-gen" (A Family's Words on Medicinal Plants):
Haji (haze) - Mountain lacquer
There are two varieties: large-leaf lacquer and small-leaf lacquer

Ju says:
The large-leaf lacquer tree grows wild and is called "nurude"
The small-leaf variety is haji. From both, wax and lacquer are extracted
for common use. Now called "urushi" (lacquer). In Edo,
at Fukagawa Imperial Boat Storage,
many are planted. This place is called "urushi-batake" (lacquer field).
Also, lacquer trees for government use are planted
on the embankments of Akasaka Gate outer areas, Meiji, and along the old
Azabu Furukawa street.

According to "Yamato Honzō" (Japanese Medicinal Plants):
Yellow sumac (haji) - Its fruit is made into candles
People plant it for profit. Also used to make bows.
In "Kyūkō Honzō" (Famine Relief Medicinal Plants) there is a tree called "kaikaisu"
This might be the haji tree.

According to "Wamyō Ruijushō" (Japanese Names Classified Collection):
Yellow sumac (hanshi) - According to "Bunsen Chū," haji (pronounced like "ko" friend, Japanese name "hanishi") is today's yellow sumac (haji) tree
○ Yellow sumac dyes yellow. Imperial robes are called "hazezome" (sumac-dyed)

From "Shinkokinshū" (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems):
Even cormorants don't cry on the lagoon field where sumac autumn leaves stand - Chikataka
The autumn wind blows enough to scatter them

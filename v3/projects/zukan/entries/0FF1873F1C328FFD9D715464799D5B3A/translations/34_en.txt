The "Tashiki-hen," Mountain Fruits section, states:
　　　Ginkgo (ginkyō)　Japanese name: ichō, commonly called: ginan　Alternative name: hakka (white fruit), daily use
　　　　　　Kōkyakushi (duck foot seed)

　　　　Ginkgo trees with deeply incised leaves are male. They do not bear fruit.
　　　　Three-ridged fruits are from males, two-ridged fruits are from females, which do bear fruit.
　　　　Females have fewer leaf incisions, and some have no incisions on the inner part of the leaves.
　　　　The flower diagram is as depicted above. They are not really flowers but rather like Japanese pepper
　　　　grains without petals. Two form a pair, and when observed in the morning, fallen flowers
　　　　can be found daily beneath the tree. The stems and fruits are beneficial for common use.

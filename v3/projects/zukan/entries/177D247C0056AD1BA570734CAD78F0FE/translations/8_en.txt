Three-leaf hollyhock, also called Yakutō, Eirei-sō

"Bencao Gangmu" states:
Wangsun - one variety　　"Chikkin-shō" states:
Tachi-aoi (standing hollyhock)

"Wakan Sansai Zue," Mountain Herbs section states:
Erenbo-sō
Ju states:
Taking Wangsun as Kenkōshi is mixed and disputed in various texts
Under the entry for Kenkōshi, "Honzō Ikka-gen" states there are two varieties of three-leaf hollyhock, etc.
These would be the two varieties with red and white flowers, perhaps?

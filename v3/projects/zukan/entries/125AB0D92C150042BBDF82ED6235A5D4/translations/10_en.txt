Ringed Plover
　Ikaru-chidori (Little Ringed Plover)
　In form it resembles a sandpiper, with a neck like a dove, and belongs to the plover family.
　It is the largest among plovers, with the entire body being pale reddish-brown with some areas
　having a slight mixture of gray. The wings, tail, and chest have pale black feathers growing,
　with white tips on the feathers. The eyes are pale reddish-brown with white edges, and it has a white
　ring around the neck. The belly is white, the bill is pale black, and the feet are yellow. When this bird
　brings together the feathers with white markings above the tail, they form what looks like a white
　horizontal line. It has a very beautiful appearance.
　There are also those that are similarly dark-colored overall with a slightly grayish tinge.
　The size is slightly smaller than a yaku (about one shaku).

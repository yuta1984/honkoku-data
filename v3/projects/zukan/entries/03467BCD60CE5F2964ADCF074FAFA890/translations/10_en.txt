Broad Bean (Soramame)　Seeds are sown in autumn and ripen in the summer of the following year. Height is three to four shaku, and those in fertile soil
　can reach up to six shaku. The stem is square-shaped with a hollow center. The leaf shape resembles Thermopsis lupinoides and is large,
　pale green in color with a slight white tinge. One stem has three or four leaves, and well-fertilized ones have six leaves
　that develop. They are tender and also used as food by poor people. Children take these leaves, crush them, and put them in their mouths,
　inflating them as playthings. This is called "Chii-chii-bukuro" in Bitchū. In spring, flowers bloom between the leaves.
　They resemble pea (endō) flowers but are narrower and longer, white in color with black spots. The outer petals have pale
　purple lines. Later they produce pods. They stand straight up, hence the name "Soramame" (sky bean). The pod size is like a finger.
　Initially green in color, turning black when ripe. When young, they are boiled and eaten together with the pods.
　There is one variety with black grains. The pods are also black. One variety from Jakarta produces small beans
　that are half the usual size. The leaf shape is the same.

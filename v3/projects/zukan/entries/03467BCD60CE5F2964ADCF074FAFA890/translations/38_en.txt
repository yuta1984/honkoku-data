《Collection of Familiar Phrases: Complete Dictionary for Poetic Learning - Medium Format - Complete 15 Volumes》
【Vertical ruled lines】
Since ancient times, the familiar phrases used in poetry composition are limited, not exceeding approximately six thousand characters. However, even great masters do not memorize half of them. Therefore, being rich in ten thousand poems yet troubled by a single character is a common affliction of poets. How much more so for those of shallow learning and limited knowledge, who, lacking poetic materials and characters, tend to rely on dictionaries like Zilin, Zihui, and Yupian, using unfamiliar character combinations and inviting criticism for being narrow and crude. This book has been compiled to remedy this problem. When one wishes to seek a needed character at the moment, by calculating its stroke count and opening the volume, it records which rhyme category within the four tones it belongs to, corrects the character meaning, distinguishes examples of level-tone and oblique-tone differences and common usage between rhyme categories, and below that collects all possible familiar phrases. For example, for the character "one" (一), it divides into both upper and lower positions like "one spring," "one flower," "first," "exclusively one," etc., ranging from two to four characters. For difficult passages, it provides complete sentences, distinguishes level and oblique tones, and applies reading translations. Its sources, besides Peiwen Yunfu and Yuanjian Leihan, select novel and elegantly familiar characters from the collected works of famous masters of Tang, Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Therefore, not only for beginning students but even for scholars of extensive knowledge and broad learning, it is an essential reference book to keep at hand for urgent needs. While Peiwen Yunfu is like the He Bi jade disc for poets, its price exceeds fifteen cities, and moreover, its massive volumes make searching inconvenient.

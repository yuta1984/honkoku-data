Hie (Barnyard millet)　There are two types: paddy field and upland varieties. Field hie grows well when planted in low wet land
　unsuitable for rice. Its form resembles millet (kibi) but the stem is slightly larger. The ear shape resembles
　foxtail millet, being large at the base and narrow at the tip. This differs from foxtail millet whose ears are large at the tip. The seeds resemble
　millet but are smaller, yet larger than foxtail millet. Those planted on dry land have the same form. Also, those with purple
　awns about two sun long are called ke-hie (hairy hie), those with short hairs are called mukuro-mochi, and those without
　awns are called wasa-hie【note】(all are dialectal terms from Tanba Province). There are also early/late and glutinous/non-glutinous varieties. There is also something called tō-hie,
　which has short seedlings and large ears resembling sedge grass. Also, a type called no-hie (Chinese name: bài) refers to wild
　varieties, of which there are several types. Inu-hie (Chinese name: hàn bài) grows wild along roadsides. It resembles foxtail grass
　but has flattened stems that don't stand upright. After summer it produces ears similar to hie but smaller and green, with some having
　awns and others not. Those with purple awns are called kuro-inu-hie (Chinese name: xuē), also known as kuma-hie (in Sendai region).
　Also, kusa-hie (Chinese name: yǒu), also called mizu-hie, is harmful to rice.

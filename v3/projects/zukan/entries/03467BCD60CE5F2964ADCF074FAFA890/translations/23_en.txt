Hiōgi　Also grows wild in mountains. People also cultivate it in their homes to appreciate the flowers. In spring it produces seedlings from old roots. The shape is like iris leaves, thick and long. They grow alternately, arranged diagonally and flat. It resembles the shape of an opened fan. From the center it extends one stem, and by the sixth or seventh month it reaches a height of 3-4 shaku, branching at the tip and opening flowers. About 2 sun in size with six petals - three large and three small. All are elongated, with reddish-yellow interior having dark vermillion spots, while the exterior is yellow, closely resembling the flower color of nōzen (Chinese trumpet vine). The red variety is called "beni-hiōgi" and the yellow variety "ki-hiōgi." Those without spots are particularly prized. After flowering it produces pods. Triangular in shape with a large tip. Diameter of 6-7 bu, length over 1 sun, with a narrow base. When ripe the pod splits open and black seeds stick to the shell. The size is like sansho (Japanese pepper) berries with a glossy appearance. In late autumn the seedlings wither. There is one variety that is short and small, not exceeding 1-2 shaku. This is commonly called "managatsuho."

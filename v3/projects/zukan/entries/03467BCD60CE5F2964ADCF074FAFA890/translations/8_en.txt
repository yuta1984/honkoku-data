Rush (igusa) Grows in moist lowlands of fields and plains. Also abundant beside ponds and marshes. Those that grow naturally have short shoots.
　When planted and cultivated in rice fields, they can reach five shaku in height. In form, they have no leaves, only stems.
　Around the fourth month, they produce branches from the middle of the stem and form ears. They are shaped like small
　millet seeds and are brown in color. They do not droop, and the seeds fall easily and readily sprout. These stems are harvested and dried
　to weave into mats. They are abundant in various provinces. Also, the white pith from inside this grass is extracted for use in lamps,
　called tōshin (lamp wick). Alternative names include Tōshimi《Wamyōshō》, Tōsumi《Ise Province》, Jimi《Hizen》,
　Tōjimi《same as above》, Inomi《Sado》, Tōshime《Nambu》, Tōsun《Izumo》. There is one
　variety called kobige《Chinese name: Juncus effusus var. decipiens》. It is thinner and shorter than lamp rush (igusa). This variety is
　planted in rice fields to make mats. Because the grass is fine and delicate, the mats are extremely dense. [Shū?]
　Later, mats woven from this material are called Bingo-omote and are considered the finest quality among mats.

Ominaeshi (Patrinia scabiosifolia)　Commonly cultivated in homes. Also grows wild in the mountains. In spring produces seedlings from old roots. Leaf shape resembles tamabōki (a type of broom) and grows in clusters. Round stem, 3-4 shaku in height, producing leaves at the nodes. Deeply lobed, becoming fine toward the tips like the terminal leaves of mugwort. Mountain varieties are small, while those cultivated at homes become large and robust, appearing like different species. In the 6th-7th months, flowers cluster at the branch tips. Unopened buds are fine like millet grains and deep yellow in color. Open flowers have five petals about 1 bu in diameter, light in color with a distinctive odor. One variety blooms in the 5th month, called tsuyu-zaki (rainy season bloomer). Another variety is called haru-no-ominaeshi (spring ominaeshi), also known as kanokosō, kinumaki, or sakuragawa-gusa. This has two types. Resembles the common type but with thinner, pointed leaflets, flowering in the 3rd month. Called kanokosō because red and white colors are mixed. One variety is a small herb about 1 shaku tall with small flowers and leaves. Common in deep mountains and secluded valleys. The folk name kanshō is incorrect. Another variety from Mount Hakusan in Kaga Province is called momijiba-no-ominaeshi, also known as hakusan-ominaeshi or kinreika in horticulture. Has round leaves with four-lobed serrated edges resembling maple leaves, growing oppositely. Stem about 1 shaku tall, opening deep yellow flowers in the 5th month. Flowers are large.

△ Primary properties: Slightly bitter, sweet, balanced, non-toxic. Effective for various postpartum ailments.

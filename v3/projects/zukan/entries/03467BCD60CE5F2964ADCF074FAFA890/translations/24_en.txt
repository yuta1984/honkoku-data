The leaf shape resembles sennichikō (globe amaranth) leaves, with pointed tips and hard texture. Where leaves attach, the stem has nodes with two leaves growing opposite each other. In the fifth and sixth months it opens flowers at the stem tip. Five petals with a shape resembling dianthus flowers, in reddish-yellow color, and there are also white flowers. There are also several varieties in red-white mixed colors and others. All produce pods after flowering. Similar to dianthus but slightly larger.

Oni-dōrō (Hōzuki - Chinese lantern plant)　In spring, shoots grow from perennial roots. The form resembles inu-hōzuki, and depending on the leaves, some grow in one to two forks, while two leaves grow side by side from one location. In summer, flowers emerge from between the leaves. They have one petal with five points like morning glories, appearing to have five petals. After flowering, they bear fruit that hangs downward. When ripe, the outer husk becomes red and beautiful, deep at the base and gradually lighter toward the tip. When broken open, there is a red round fruit inside, which children collect as toys. There is one variety with a flattened outer husk called kinchaku-hōzuki. It is also called kabocha-hōzuki, hira-hōzuki (Sakushū), and kukuri-zukin (Edo). There are several other varieties. One variety called ko-hōzuki (Chinese name: kǔ zhí) is also known as Chōsen-hōzuki, hatake-hōzuki, sasa-hōzuki (Sanshū), sennari-hōzuki (Bishū), and no-hōzuki (Bitchū), and grows wild in fields and plains. It is smaller than hōzuki and its fruit is also very small. Both the outer husk and inner fruit are green and do not turn red.

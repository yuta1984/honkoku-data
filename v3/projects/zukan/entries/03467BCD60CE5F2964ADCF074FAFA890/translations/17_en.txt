Kibi (Millet)　There are many varieties. Those that are not sticky are called shoku, and sticky ones are called mochi-kibi (Chinese name: shǔ). Collectively they are also called ko-kibi (from Yamato Honzō). The seed husks come in red, white, and black varieties. The seedling forms are all the same. Seeds are sown in the fifth month and mostly cultivated in fields. The leaf shape resembles foxtail millet but is slightly wider. Height is three to four shaku. In the sixth to seventh months, ears develop at the top of the shoots. Unlike foxtail millet ears, many thin branches divide and fine seeds cluster together. The shape is not round but pointed at the tip, resembling the shape of a ginkgo nut, about one bu in size, with luster. When the seeds ripen, the plant withers.

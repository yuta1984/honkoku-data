Corn (Nanbankibi)　Commonly cultivated in household fields. The form resembles sorghum but is shorter with a thicker stem. Seeds are planted around the third month. When grown, it reaches 6-7 shaku in height. It produces spikes at the top of the shoot, branching and producing flowers. These have only stamens without petals, hanging downward. They resemble rice flowers. Between each leaf it produces husks with red silk hanging down from above. There are also those with white silk. Inside the husks, it produces several hundred grains the size of beans, attached in rings around a long axis. The shape is like a string of beads. Length is 6-7 sun, diameter about 1.5 sun. There are varieties with red grains that are glutinous. These make the best popped corn. There are yellow varieties that are non-glutinous. There are white varieties that are inferior in taste. In Amagasaki, Settsu Province, they call this shiro-nanban. There are also varieties with mixed red and white, and mixed purple and white. These are called taimai-nanban. There are also varieties with white grains having thin red streaks, and others that are yellow with large grains. The seedlings are also large. In Bitchū and Shikoku they call it nanba. All varieties wither in late autumn.

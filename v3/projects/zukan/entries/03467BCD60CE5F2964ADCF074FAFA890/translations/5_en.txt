Self-heal　Grows abundantly wild in mountains and fields. Has leaves throughout the four seasons. The shape resembles mint leaves,
　with slightly pointed tips and shallow serrated edges. In winter it grows in clusters close to the ground. After spring, it extends its stem
　to a height of six to seven sun, or sometimes over one shaku. Leaves are opposite. Around May, it produces spikes at the stem tip and
　opens flowers. Deep purple color, and some have deep purple tinged with blue. There are also pale purple, deep red,
　pale red, and white varieties. The flower shape closely resembles that of dead-nettle. After the flowers fall, the calyx is
　about one to two sun long. The shape resembles a quiver (utsubo). It also closely resembles globe amaranth flowers. This plant is
　commonly called summer-withering grass (kagoso), but this is incorrect. It flowers after the summer solstice and does not wither in summer—
　it is a distinct species. The true summer-withering grass is the plant called Juni-hitoe mentioned in the "Wamyosho."
　It grows in sunny places in the mountains. The leaves resemble those of Inula and have coarse serrated edges with much white hair. In the third and
　fourth months, it produces spikes at the stem tip of two to three sun length. Small flowers attach densely. Five petals, white in color. There are also pale purple
　and purple-blue varieties. When flowering ends, there are four small seeds in the calyx. The plant withers when they ripen.
△　Main properties　Bitter, pungent, cold, non-toxic. Treats beriberi and treats gonorrhea.

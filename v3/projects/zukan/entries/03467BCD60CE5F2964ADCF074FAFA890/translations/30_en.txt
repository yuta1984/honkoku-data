Dayflower (Tsuyukusa)　Very abundant in fields and meadows, preferring shaded places. Also grows around houses. In spring it sends out shoots with stems creeping along the ground, with leaves growing alternately at each node. The shape resembles bamboo leaves but is somewhat broader and softer. From late summer onward, flowers bloom between the leaves at branch tips, opening in the morning and wilting at noon. They are deep blue with two petals. There are also white flowers, and also blue-white colored ones, and some that are blue with white edges. All form fine seeds after flowering. When ripe, both shoots and roots wither together. The seeds fall and self-propagate. In Oda village, Kuritō district, Gōshū province, they cultivate these plants to extract juice from the petals and dye paper as a commercial product. This is a famous local specialty called Yamada no aobana. In Sesshū it's called bōshigami, and in the Kantō region it's called aigami. It is essential for drawing preliminary designs on clothing. When this paper is soaked in water and flower patterns are drawn with the blue juice, then paste is applied and it's put into dye solution, everything disappears. This variety differs from ordinary types: the shoots grow 3-4 shaku tall, leaves are 6-7 sun long and about 1 sun wide, and flowers are over 1 sun in size.

△Primary properties　Bitter and very cold, non-toxic. Reduces water retention, promotes urination, and treats throat swelling.

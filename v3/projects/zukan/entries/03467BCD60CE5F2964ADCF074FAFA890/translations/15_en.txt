Peas　Seeds are sown in autumn months and ripen in the following summer. It is a climbing vine. The leaf shape resembles wisteria
　but the tips are not pointed and have a whitish tinge. From the leaf tips, particularly fine tendrils emerge and
　twine around nearby objects. In spring, flowers grow between each leaf. In warm regions, they bloom from
　winter. The shape resembles kidney beans but is larger. There are purple and white varieties. Both produce
　pods after flowering. They are longer and larger than soybeans. The seeds are perfectly round, different from the flat
　shape of soybeans. When young, they are boiled and eaten together with the pods. There is one variety of foreign origin
　called Sarumame, also known as Saruendō, which is the name used in Bitchū Province. The seedling shape is
　the same, with both purple and white flowers. The beans are large, about twice the usual size. These pods
　cannot be eaten even when young. In both cases, the seeds ripen and the plants wither in the fifth month.

【Middle Section】
　Various materia medica texts refer to sancha as tsubaki (camellia), and also
　call sasanqua "saben sakuha." Now it is
　commonly called sasanqua, using the same fu character for correspondence. Some say
　that calling tsubaki "tsubaki" is incorrect. Sasanqua and
　sancha (tsubaki) use the same tsu character (meaning "to scatter") and are called kairyū (sea pomegranate),
　but are distinguished by calling one sasanqua.
　　In common parlance called:
　　　Azuma-nishiki (Eastern Brocade)
　　　Negishi-kō (Negishi Red)
　　　Ume-no-kaze (Plum Wind)
　These are valued as rare varieties.

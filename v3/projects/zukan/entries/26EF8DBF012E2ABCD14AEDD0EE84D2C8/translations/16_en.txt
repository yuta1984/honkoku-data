Considering the Seiobo peach mentioned by Juge-jō:
What is illustrated on the right, though called winter peach, is a different variety that
blooms in the cold season, and the fruit ripens in the third month. The
Seiobo peach recorded in various materia medica has pale pink flowers with thousand petals (double blooms), large flowers, and when the tree reaches about one shaku
in height, it rarely blooms. The fruit grows in pairs at each location. There are no leaves until the flowers fall, and leaves
emerge after the flowers drop. Sometimes flowers bloom among the leaves around the sixth or seventh month.
It resembles ■ one year. The fruit also ripens in the fifth or sixth month.
Those whose fruit does not fall during flowering are called Seiobo
peaches, but Japanese and Chinese varieties are not the same. There is also a separate winter peach
with pale pink single-petal flowers and fruit that ripens in winter. This
should be the Seiobo peach mentioned in works like Yamato Honzō and Yūyō Zassu. Japan's Seiobo peach
may be named after a beautiful woman due to the beauty of its flowers.

Yamato Honzō states under the peach entry: "Winter peach has single-petal flowers and fruit ripens in the ninth and tenth months.
There is a winter peach composition by Hakugen. Yūyō Zassu says it first ripens in the tenth month of winter, shaped like
a snake gourd, also called Seiobo peach." The peach called Seiobo in Japan has double flowers and
is large. The flowers fall late and are beautiful. This is a Japanese name, not a Chinese name.
And so forth.
Wakan Sansai Zue: "Seiobo peach is also called winter peach, Kunlun peach, and hermit peach.
What is now called Seiobo peach has tree and leaves no different from regular peaches. However, peaches do not flower unless
they are at least three years old. This tree, when grown from seed, blooms the following year with pale pink thousand-petaled flowers and
bears fruit." And so forth.
The Book of Han states: "During Emperor Wu's time, a one-legged blue bird came and perched before the emperor. Dongfang Shuo said, 'The Queen Mother of the West should come in hiding.'
Then the Queen Mother came and presented seven peach fruits. These are celestial fruits that
ripen once every three thousand years. Three of those hidden behind the screen stole and ate them." And so forth.
　　Do enthusiasts proudly call this peach, which unusually ripens in winter, the Seiobo peach?

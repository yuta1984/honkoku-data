Camellia (tsubaki)　　Mandala "Gunfōfu (Collected Fragrant Genealogies)"

　The fact that "tsubaki" (椿) is written as "camellia" is an error, as I record in the section on tsubaki, so I will omit it here. Japan has had varieties since ancient times, and now there are over two hundred varieties. Since I cannot show all the varieties, I present only one or two. Although there are names of varieties in the collected commentaries, there are only three or four names, so those plants close to those varieties are recorded according to each section. Since I could not actually observe all the illustrations in each section planted in gardens, I supplemented them by obtaining the Camellia Manual of the Chikuzen lord and illustrations from certain individuals.

　　　Red ones also bloom

■Mount Yoshino
　　　Light-colored, thick ring-shaped flowers
　　　with white edges, blooming
　　　abundantly in such a way that
　　　it looks just like an old cherry tree
　　　in full bloom

▲Flower rings
　　　Being flowers, they do not
　　　fade, and like vermillion color,
　　　thick rings gather in one place

　　　Many cluster together and bloom
　　　The flower shape and leaf tips
　　　are no different. They drop leaves in winter.
　　　It would be appropriate to call
　　　this red azalea, mountain-reflecting red,
　　　or cuckoo flower. While cuckoo flower
　　　is also said to be another name
　　　for satsuki azalea, in the Kagakushū
　　　it appears as a tsutsuji flower.
　　　The flowers are also vermillion-colored
　　　like this flower, and their peak bloom
　　　occurs in that season.

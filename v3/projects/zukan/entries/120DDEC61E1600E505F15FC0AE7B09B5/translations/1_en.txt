To transfer life into one's heart and paint bone structure with one's brush is the way of painting.
Now, my disciple Utamaro has written about copying the life of insects, which is truly
painting from the heart. Utamaro has been meticulous about things since he was young. He would simply
play by tying dragonflies with thread or placing crickets
on his palm for amusement, thinking of nothing else.
Fearing that he might harm their lives, I admonished him many times.
Now his brushwork has truly made the virtue of his training shine.

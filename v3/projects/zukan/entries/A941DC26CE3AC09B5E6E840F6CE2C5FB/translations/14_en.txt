The "Yamato Honzo" states:
True orchid　　The Japanese name is fujibakama. It is also called araragi. In ancient poetry it was called "ran," and the "Yakumo-sho" also writes that orchid is called "fujibakama" or "ran." This is the true orchid. In ancient poetry, fujibakama was frequently composed about. In Kunishin's poem:
"In the autumn field, clustering orchids (fujibakama) stand - who dyed them such a deep purple?"
This is the orchid sung about in the Book of Songs and Songs of Chu. In ancient times, various aromatic woods like agarwood and sandalwood had not yet arrived from China, so orchid was greatly prized. What we now call orchid is like large-leafed ophiopogon with fragrant flowers. It is called "quiet orchid," but it is not the true orchid of ancient times.

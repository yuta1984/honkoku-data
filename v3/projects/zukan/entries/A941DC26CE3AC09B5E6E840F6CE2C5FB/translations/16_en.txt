The "Somoku Ikushu Bika-rui" (Classification of Beautiful Cultivated Flowers and Plants) states:
Blue chrysanthemum (ezogiku)
Ten-thousand-year chrysanthemum, from Suruga Province

Baien says:
The blue chrysanthemum comes from Ezo Island in recent times, hence the name. If so, it would be "Ezo chrysanthemum." There is also Ezo violet, which is similar to this. The source of the name "blue chrysanthemum" is unclear. I wish to investigate this further. Besides this, it does not appear in materia medica texts.

The "Wakan Sansai Zue" (Illustrated Sino-Japanese Encyclopedia) in the section on climbing plants states:
Sekichiri (ishimikawa) - Red bryony, goshitsu, five poison grass
《ushinohanazura》 snake herb, mountain buckwheat
"ishimikawa"《also called "ushino"》

The "Kōeki Chikin-shō" (Comprehensive Botanical Manual) states:
Sekichiri (ishimikawa)《also called》gama mentō (frog face scratcher)

In the "Yamato Honzō" (Japanese Materia Medica), sekichiri and gama mentō are listed separately, but these are the same plant with two names, perhaps distinguishing between large and small varieties with two different names. However, the size of plant species depends on the locality and soil fertility, and through human cultivation there can be ones that grow thick and luxuriant (magnificent ones), as can be understood. However, there are also those belonging to the chōryōsō (Dioscorea) and bankaiso types.

The "Yamato Honzō" (Japanese Materia Medica) states:
Autumn peony, Japanese name is "taugiku"
Also called Korean chrysanthemum
《Marginal note: kōraikiku》
In Edo (Bukō)
Autumn bright chrysanthemum - this is not recorded in the Yamato Honzō

The "Wakan Sansai Zue" (Illustrated Sino-Japanese Encyclopedia) in the section on marsh plants states:
Purple robe chrysanthemum (shiegiku), Kaga chrysanthemum
Echizen chrysanthemum
Kibune chrysanthemum
All of the above are common names
The proper name is unclear
Some say it is "shūmeigiku"

They are abundant in the valleys around the shrines outside Kaga, outside Echizen, and outside the capital at Kibune. Hence these three names exist

Golden Narcissus - Dutch Yellow Narcissus

Eighteenth day of the second month, Tenpō 15, year of the Dragon - True illustration of one potted plant by the rainy window

The Dutch narcissus is called "gekkakō" (tuberose), and its form resembles that of brahmin ginseng, belonging to the category of slimy grasses. It is a summer-blooming plant that produces six-petaled white flowers. Unlike ordinary narcissus, it differs greatly in form from this yellow narcissus. The yellow narcissus first arrived in Tenpō 9 and is greatly prized.

The Wakan Sansai Zue (Japanese-Chinese Illustrated Encyclopedia) states in the Fragrant Plants section:
　　　Peony (fukamigusa)
　　　Chinese pronunciation is "myōtan"　Other names are the same as recorded later
　　　　　　　　　　Therefore abbreviated





The Wamyō Ruijushō (Japanese Names Classified Collection) states:
　　　Peony　The Honzō commentary states that peony has one name "roku-kyū" (Kyōyū's Japanese name is fukamihisasa)
　　　(fukamigusa)

In China it is called the "King of Flowers" and considered the most magnificent of flowers. In China, the peonies of Luoyang are
considered a famous product. In Japan, perhaps there were no peonies in ancient times? They are not
sung of in the Man'yōshū, Kokin-shū, and other collections. In the Shika-shū, when the New Emperor (Emperor Sutoku) was on the throne, he composed a poem about peonies,
to which the Chancellor and Grand Minister (Fujiwara no Tadamichi) replied in verse: "From when they bloomed until they scattered completely,
I gazed at them for such a time that I grew old beneath the flowers." ○The Japanese name is nijū, also called fukamigusa.
Perhaps in ancient times they were not appreciated? There are not many poems by poets about them. In China too, although the Shennong Bencao
includes peonies, appreciating these flowers was rare before the Tang dynasty. The Helin Yulu states:
"Peonies were unheard of before the Tang dynasty; it was during Empress Wu's time that woodcutters first discovered them in the mountains." In China
too, before the Tang dynasty, literati did not compose poems about peonies. It is natural that there was no appreciation of them in ancient Japan.
This explanation is recorded in the Yamato Honzō.

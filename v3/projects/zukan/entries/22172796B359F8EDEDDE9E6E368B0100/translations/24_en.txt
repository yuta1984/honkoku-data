The almanac (saijiki) lists peonies in the summer
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　season. Is this based on the summer theory?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Peonies reach their peak in the middle of
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　the "kosen" period. If so, they would enter
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　the summer season. My flower catalog
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　does not consider seasons but captures
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　the blooming flowers as they appear in life.





The Jiwu Qiyuan (Origin of Things) states that peony flowers first
arrived during the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui, and during the Kaigen era of Tang,
both the imperial court and common people competed in admiring them. From this time
this flower became known.
Chen Meigong's Secret Collection states that when cutting peony flowers,
one must not hurry. If rushed, the flower's beauty will be damaged. The common saying
"Do not approach peonies carelessly" refers to this principle. In the poetry collections of our dynasty's literati,
there are no peony poems. Master Zhang once said:
"Yang Zihua of Northern Qi painted peonies with extreme
precision. From this we know that peonies already existed
in Northern Qi."

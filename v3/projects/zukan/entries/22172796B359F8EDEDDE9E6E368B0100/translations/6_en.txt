Winter flower (Fukinotō) - Another variety appears again
　　　　　　　　The Japanese names and alternate names are recorded
　　　　　　　　in volume one of the spring section, so I omit
　　　　　　　　them here

Cui Yuxi's Shijing (Food Classic) states: "Fuki 《Japanese name: Fubuki》 has leaves resembling mallow,
round and broad. Its stems can be boiled and eaten. Even in winter 《now called tō》, in winter the leaves
do not fall or wither. The herbal texts do not distinguish between the two plants. However, this is the fuki
that is illustrated."
In the Bencao Gangmu (Compendium of Materia Medica), there are red-flowered varieties, commonly called minetoha (peak bucket leaves)
and also named mizutoha (water bucket leaves). However, I have not yet heard of any with red flowers.

According to Enkō, the six-petaled plum now common among tree cultivators
comes in two varieties, red and white, both single-layered. The form is smaller
than ordinary plums, with narrow petals that taper to points. Those whose petals
are spaced apart and do not overlap are called nokiba (eaves-leaf) plum.
Also, what is called nokibata plum has double petals with small form,
the outer petals of the hollow are red while the inner ones are white with red stripes.
Also, Sakai crimson plum (from Senshu Sakai) has single flowers of extreme red, with five
and six petals alternating. The red petals also have
pointed tips and narrow petals. This is likely the same variety as six-petaled plum.

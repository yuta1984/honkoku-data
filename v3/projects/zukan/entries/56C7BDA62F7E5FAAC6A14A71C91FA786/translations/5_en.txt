Sweet Chrysanthemum (Kankiku) - Culinary Chrysanthemum

This is a type of autumn chrysanthemum that grows to a height of three to four shaku (approximately 90-120 cm) and blooms in September. The petals are tubular and yellow in color, with numerous petals and no visible center disc. Each individual petal has a tubular base and splits into five sections at the tip. The taste is sweet, and it is excellent for both medicinal and culinary purposes. When preserved in salt, the color and flavor do not change for a long time, which is why this variety is called "longevity chrysanthemum" (jumei-kiku).

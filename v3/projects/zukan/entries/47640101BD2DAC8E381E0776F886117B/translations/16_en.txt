According to the "Garden History": The Wu region's common name is Gubi-jin-so (Corn poppy).

According to the "Yamato Honzo" flower and plant section: Commonly called Bijin-so (Beauty grass) in Japan
　　　Gubi-jin-so (Corn poppy)

　　　　　I say:
　　　　　　The "Wakan Sansai Zue" records Reishun-ka as Bijin-so, but this is incorrect. Reishun-ka is
　　　　　　Senba-keshi (Hinageshi/corn poppy). The explanation in the "Bencao Gangmu" is detailed. It resembles but does not resemble the opium poppy. The flowering opium
　　　　　　poppy is the red-purple flowered variety of the opium poppy, and the seeds are separated.

　　　　　According to the "Saijiki" (Seasonal Records):
　　　　　　Gubi-jin-so: In the valleys of Mount Hobachi, there is Gubi-jin-so. Its form is as
　　　　　　large as a cockscomb. It has no flowers. The leaves are beautiful and arranged in pairs. When one sings the song of Lady Yu (Gubi-jin), both leaves move like clapping hands,
　　　　　　quite like keeping rhythm, etc. ○ I say this explanation is most dubious. I have not yet heard of another variety of Gubi-jin-so.

Yang's anthology states:
　Horse tooth grass　umahiyu (purslane)

The Bencao Gangmu states that there are two types of horse purslane.
The large-leafed variety is not suitable for use; the small-leafed variety has
mercury-like sap between the nodes and leaves. Its leaves are blue,
stems are red, flowers are yellow, roots are white, and seeds are black, therefore
it is called five-element grass.
Horse purslane is named so because its leaves resemble horse teeth,
and because it is soft and slippery, it is called suberihiyu
(sliding-smooth plant). "Suberi" is the Japanese word for slippery.

"Honzō Ikka-gen" (Personal Views on Materia Medica) states there are three types of saiko (Bupleurum). Nira-leaf saiko is Kamakura type. Akaguma is hakutōō (Pulsatilla). Kawara type is hanpakusō. ○According to another theory by predecessors, one type is Kamakura, one type Kawara, one type bamboo-leaf.
Genju examines "Honzō Wakai" and finds that southern saiko is the Kamakura type, northern saiko is the Kawara type, stating there are two types.
Those who now propose three types consider bamboo-leaf as Kamakura type. ○Southern saiko ○Kawara is hanpakusō. However, saiko is not limited to three types.

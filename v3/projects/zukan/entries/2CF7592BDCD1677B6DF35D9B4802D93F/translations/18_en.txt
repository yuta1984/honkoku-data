"Zōho Tashikihen" (Expanded Botanical Dictionary), Mountain Grass Plants section, records:
　Jingō (Gentiana) 〈Japanese name〉〈called Togarikusa or Hakarikusa〉
　　〈Supplementary alternative names〉Qin Qiu 〈Tang Ben〉Qin Sō 〈Yōhei〉
"Honzō Wakai" (Japanese Interpretation of Materia Medica) records the alternative name Qin Qiu. Since I
have listed the same names, I omit this. "Yamato Honzō" does not
include Jingō.

"Zōho Tashikihen" (Expanded Botanical Dictionary), Mountain Grass Plants section states:
　Shajin (Adenophora) 〈Japanese name〉〈Totoki〉〈Alternative names〉White ginseng 〈Wu Pu〉Chimo 〈Bieroku〉
　　　Sheep's milk 〈same〉Sheep grandmother's milk 〈Kōmoku〉Bell-child grass 〈Bieroku〉
　　　Tiger whiskers 〈same〉Bitter heart 〈same〉
"Yamato Honzō Yakumei Bengi" (Discussions on Medicinal Plant Names in Japanese Materia Medica) states:
　　Li Shizhen said that the five ginsengs and five colors correspond to the five organs,
　　therefore shajin enters the lungs and is called white ginseng

"Kyūkō Honzō" (Famine Relief Pharmacopoeia) states:
　Shajin (Bellflower)　Shitoru　Shikimi　Monkishō

"Yamato Honzō" states: There are two types of shajin that come from China.
One type resembles bellflower. This matches the present grass. The leaves are three to four leaves
and closely resemble bellflower in stem and root. The leaves resemble apricot leaves and the stem is
also like that of bellflower. This is what "Chikin-shō" calls apricot-leaf shajin.
In Japan it is called Totoki ginseng or Tsurikane ginseng. The country people of Chikushi
call it Shitenba. Shajin is used as a substitute for ginseng.

In Mencius's book, Confucius said "I hate yū grass
because I fear it will disturb the crops"
　　This refers to foxtail grass

In "Jiga-yoku," "yū is grass that harms crops." "Setsumоn" only
says "yū grows under grain crops," and earlier scholars did not specifically
identify what plant it was. Wei Zhao, interpreting "Roго," said
"yū grass resembles millet but has no fruit." Also, when Wei Yао questioned about poetry, "What plant is the yū of Hoden?", 
the answer was "today's foxtail grass." After this, the matter became clear.
Today's foxtail grass indeed resembles millet but bears no fruit and
grows everywhere.

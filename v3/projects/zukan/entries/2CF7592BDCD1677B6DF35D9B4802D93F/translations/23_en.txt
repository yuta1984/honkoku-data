"Chikinsho" (Records of Ground Brocade) states:
　Chiyu (Sanguisorba)

Listing varieties of karukaya (Miscanthus), the nomenclature of chiyu is improper and erroneous.

Various texts state:
　Karukaya (Japanese pampas grass)　Oat
　　Wagamokō

There is a separate plant called chiyu, which resembles the fruit of flowering mulberry. Its Japanese name is wagamokō. Same name, different plant.
"Yamato Honzō" (Japanese Materia Medica) states under the entry for chiyu:
There is separately a thing called waremokō. It belongs to the awn grasses. Its flowers are like ears of grain, resembling miscanthus.
This explanation corresponds. This variety is a different species from the above.

"Jiuhuang Bencao" (Famine Relief Materia Medica) states:
　Wild ginger (Kikyōno-ryūkido) is substituted
　　　Shiogama chrysanthemum

In "Bencao" (Materia Medica) it is named Liu Jinu.

This plant is commonly called shiogama chrysanthemum. Masen-kō also has the same name but is a different plant. Some Confucian doctors of the Shakubenkē school substitute it for wild ginger, but upon consideration, there is a theory that wild ginger is a different plant.

"Nanshi" (History of the Southern Dynasties) states: When Emperor Gaozu of Song (Liu Yu's childhood name was Qinu) was young, he was cutting miscanthus in Xinzhou when he encountered a great serpent and shot it. The next day he went and heard the sound of mortars and pestles. When he searched and looked, he saw several children, all in blue clothes, in a hazel grove, pounding medicine. When he asked the reason, they answered: "Our king was shot by Liu Qinu, so now we are preparing medicine." Yu said, "Why doesn't the spirit kill him?" They said, "Qinu is a king. He cannot be killed." When Yu scolded them, all the children scattered. Then he collected the medicine and returned. Whenever he encountered sword wounds, he applied it, and they immediately healed. People therefore called this grass Liu Jinu.

　This account is not about wild ginger, but about the Liu Jinu of hanhunkusō (Ainsliaea). Public opinion has not yet been definitively decided.

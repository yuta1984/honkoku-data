Today's pharmacists cultivate it extensively from Yamashiro Province's Nagaike or Yamato Province. There are those that grow naturally in the mountains, and their medicinal potency is strong. It grows on Mount Ibuki in Ōmi Province. It is also abundant on Dōkan-yama in eastern Musashi. This herb, namely the tōki seedlings from the aforementioned places, blooms in the second year after sprouting, and the fragrance of leaves and roots is very strong. There is also a Chinese variety which differs greatly; in Japan this is used as tōki, and is also called yamabōfū or zengo. Zengo is similar to this but different, as shown in the 7th volume of the summer section. This should be consulted for reference.

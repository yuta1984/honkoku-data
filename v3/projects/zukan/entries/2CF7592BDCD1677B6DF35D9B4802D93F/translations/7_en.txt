In "Honzō Kōmoku" it states: "Senji has one name shi, and is also called kakkisō (thirst-relieving grass). Long ago, when people drove sheep into Shu, the seeds of this grass had many thorns and stuck to the sheep's wool, eventually reaching China. Therefore it was named yōfurai (sheep-carried-here)."

△Upon examination, senji (Japanese name: namomi), commonly called onamomi. Probably kikei and this are comparable as male and female.

　I consider and say:
The explanation in "Honkō" is not clear. The fruit of senji has no thorns and does not stick to people's clothes. The fruit of kikei is sticky and adheres to people's palms, and after withering sticks to people's clothes. With this, when driving sheep, it would stick to their wool. In Bukō (Edo), kikei is abundant and comes across withered fields. Dogs all have kikei seeds in their fur. From this we can consider. In my humble opinion, calling it senji is incorrect.

"Mōshi Hinbutsu Zukō" by Ji Shizhen states:
　Water ■ [possibly turtle] Fúcài [Kaeru-enza, Dōgame-kakami, Chan-chan-mo]

"Sancai Tuhui":
　Turtle lotus sheep grass

Some mistakenly consider fúcài to be xìng (Nymphoides) vegetables, and xìng vegetables to be water lilies, but both are errors.
Xìng vegetables, sleeping vegetables (Hitsujigusa) [Korenke], water shield vegetables, and fúcài are four species of one category but different varieties.

"Yamato Honzō" states:
　Cockscomb flower (Keitōge) [The same book's "Yakumei Bengi" states: cockscomb seeds are the same as fox nut seeds, their seed pods resemble a cockscomb]

　　There are three varieties of flowers: red, white, and yellow, with many excellent varieties,
　　Those that are bright red and greatly layered are
　　　　called brocade cockscomb

"Sōka-fu" states: there are those with purple and white on the same stem,
named two-color cockscomb

"Zōho Tashikihen" lists under marsh grasses and states:

Lycoris (Dead Person's Flower, Abandoned Child's Flower)

Allium macrostemon
Also called Manjushage (Red Spider Lily)
Also called Red Flower

"Jiuhuang Yepu" (Famine Relief Flora) records:
　Allium macrostemon (Dead Person's Flower) [Tenkai Flower]

When flowers bloom, there are no leaves; when there are no flowers, there are leaves
Therefore in Tsukushi it is called "Abandoned Child's Flower"
"Yamato Honzo" treats golden lamp grass as manjusha, but how is this? Though the flower shapes are similarly alike, the colors differ, and manjushage has six flowers on one stem. As stated in "Dijinchao": "resembles golden lamp grass with flowers like vermillion" - this matches well.

"Dijinchao" states:
　Impatiens (Tsurifunesou - Touch-me-not)

　Horizontal cloud grass
"Honzo" says:
　Zuona grass (Tsurifunesou, Yokokumo-sou)

Touch-me-not also has yellow-flowered varieties - one species
It would be good to treat it as a separate variety

Narrow-leaf nagi (Nageia nagi)
The white variegation appears at the shoot tips, and though it is said that variegation does not appear after the spring leaves emerge, this is a rare curiosity. It is an incomparable specimen that becomes prominent around summer.
・The pale yellow striped nagi has white shoot tips that appear to be dusted with snow, making it an exceptionally fine specimen.
・The round-leaf nagi has thick, dark, glossy leaves with extremely white margins emerging from it, making it an unparalleled famous tree of all times.
This single tree from Mizuno-ō, besides branch sports, has limitless rare specimens from China and Japan, though it is difficult to rank them first or second. It has not yet been given to others.

Regarding the hiiragi-tsubaki (holly-leaved camellia), in ancient times when white-flowered sasanqua was treasured, a variety with unusual leaves emerged from among the sasanqua. Its shape resembled that of holly, with large serrated edges. Therefore, it was named hiiragi-sasanqua. Currently, this variety can often be found in the world, and it is said to have originally been produced from his house.

Incidentally, this Ihē was the author of "Jikinshō" (a horticultural treatise). Therefore, he was skilled in cultivation techniques, and now his descendants have inherited this and are flourishing in this field.

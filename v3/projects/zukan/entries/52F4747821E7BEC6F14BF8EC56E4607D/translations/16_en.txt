Kamo (Wild duck) - also called magamo, also called aokubi
　Fu (wild duck)
　The taste is sweet and slightly warm with no toxicity. It supplements the middle burner, kills intestinal parasites, treats edema
　and heals malignant sores.
　Duck species are very numerous. Among them, aokubi (mallard) is considered the finest. It has abundant fat and delicious taste
　with balanced properties. However, its supplementing benefits do not match those of wild geese. People with weak spleen and stomach
　should not eat it. It should be avoided for sword wounds and blood circulation disorders. Overeating causes phlegm　
　to arise and may also trigger scabies.

Preface to the Illustrated Guide to Ornamental Birds (Kachōfu)

The avian species of our imperial nation are countless and innumerable. Among these, those that can serve as regular fare number no less than several dozen varieties. Here I have selected and recorded them, obtaining exactly sixty-one species. For each species I have created an illustration, marking both the Japanese and Chinese names for each, leaving blank those whose details remain unclear. I have also recorded their flavor and medicinal properties, titling this work "Kachōfu" (Illustrated Guide to Ornamental Birds). A visitor raised a question, saying: "This is merely a bird manual—why does it bear the name 'ornamental birds'?" I replied: "Sixty-one forms the character 'ka' (華). This refers to the illustration of sixty-one bird species." The visitor smiled and departed. Thus I make this my preface. Written on the fifteenth day of the first month of Man'en 2, year of the Metal Rooster, by the old man Yōchiku, Mori Tatsuyuki, beneath the southern eaves of Sakuraku while enjoying New Year's spiced sake.

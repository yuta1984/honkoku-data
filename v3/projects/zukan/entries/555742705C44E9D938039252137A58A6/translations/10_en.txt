Those with long shells include forms like folding fans and board houses with protruding ears on both sides, or those like venus clams and ark shells with rounded shell wings, and those with long shell wings - their genera and species are extremely numerous. There are also many unnamed varieties.

○There are also specimens that have different names based on patterns, coloration, surface texture, and size. Some are named differently according to whether their shells are large, medium, or small. There are specimens that share the same name but are different species. As for variations in surface texture and patterns, they cannot all be enumerated - it is like the differences in human faces.

○The specimens appearing in various materia medica and other books focus primarily on medicinal and food uses. Therefore, those varieties number only five to six hundred species. What I document here includes aberrant forms of clams, snails, and shells, extending to univalve oysters, which will likely exceed a thousand species. As for deformations and color variations, there is no time to enumerate them all.

○The specimens I document here are deliberately not intended for medicinal or food purposes. Therefore, I have omitted records of their therapeutic properties and flavors. This is solely to reveal the great wonders of heaven and earth's creation. Hence, I present faithful drawings of various aberrant forms of clams, snails, shells, univalves, and oysters, even including operculate types. The remaining sections on deformations and color variations will be compiled in separate volumes to be appended later. Turtles, soft-shelled turtles, crabs, shrimp, and the like are also relegated to separate volumes and not included here.

○There are those who, though shells with Chinese names may be of humble quality, treasure and value them for appreciation. Conversely, even rare shells and fine specimens without Chinese names that do not appear in various texts are despised and rejected by some. This is their peculiar habit and represents a deficiency - they are not truly lovers of shells. Objects exist first, then books follow. It is best when both specimens and documentation are available together. It is good to trust books while also examining specimens, achieving understanding through both. Adhering only to books is the behavior of beginners.

○Although explanations of shells appear in various texts, much useless theorizing occurs without knowledge of the actual specimens. Therefore, such accounts are insufficient as evidence. What I document now has been obtained by requesting specimens from fellow enthusiasts' collections, faithfully drawing the true form of each variety with patterns and surface textures rendered truly lifelike, so that when fellow enthusiasts open these volumes, there may be some small benefit.

○Although China is a vast country, the sea is distant. Nearby countries are necessarily remote and provincial, and their local refinement and culture

General Principles
[Library seal: Imperial Library Collection]
○I have been collecting shells for a long time. The items I now possess number several hundred varieties. However, many are unnamed, and showing them to fellow enthusiasts to identify each one individually is inefficient. When I previously surveyed the shell sections in various books, I found that commonly known specimens had multiple names for a single variety, which was extremely confusing. Moreover, unnamed specimens were most numerous. Therefore, I have now provisionally named them according to their forms and await correction by future scholars.

○The term "kai" (shell creatures) refers to these seven types: clams, snails, shells, crabs, shrimp, turtles, and soft-shelled turtles. Those creatures that have flesh inside and hard parts outside are all called "kai." Cowrie shells and false angel wing shells and their varieties are called "gai" (shells). "Clams" refers generally to those with two shells that fit together. Coiled ones are called "spiral shells."

○There are also circular forms like moon-and-sun shells and sea mirrors, or horizontally elongated ones like blind shells and reed blinds, or vertically elongated ones like straw raincoat shells and feather shells, or those bent at knee-like angles like razor clams and mussels

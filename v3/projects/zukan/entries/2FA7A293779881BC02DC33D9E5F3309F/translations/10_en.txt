Lesser Cardamom (Sōzuku)

According to a Dutch illustration by Uheiman [possibly a person's name], among the types of Karanga [possibly Latin], the shoots (leaves) resemble wei rui and are long, bearing fruit from beside the roots, shaped like pine cones. The roots spread horizontally and resemble galangal. This is lesser cardamom.

Shukusha-mitsu (Amomum cardamom)
　Cardamomium mayus [uncertain] 《Dutch》

This is an illustration by the Dutch botanist Uheiman.
Its form is like that of a woody plant, with divided branches, narrow and long leaves, and fruits that hang down and are reddish-black in color.
However, according to the "Bencao Gangmu" (Compendium of Materia Medica), both shukusha (cardamom) and yakuchi (alpinia) are herbaceous plants, which does not match this illustration. Although this illustration is difficult to believe, since it is an ancient Western diagram, I include it here for the time being.

Greater Galangal (Kōryōkyō)　　Kumatakeran　Galanga (Dutch)

This is a Chinese species. It withers in winter. Its form resembles myōga (Japanese ginger), reaching three to four shaku in height, with thick, glossy leaves. It forms spikes of four to five sun, with two calyxes per node, each opening flowers. The shape resembles iris but is somewhat larger, and pale red in color. The fruit is red and resembles mountain ginger seeds. This is called red cardamom. This accords with Shizhen's explanation. The roots resemble mountain ginger but are enlarged.

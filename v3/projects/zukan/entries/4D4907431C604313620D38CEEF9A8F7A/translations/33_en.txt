Stone Dragon Mustard (taroraji)　Ground Brocade　
(ushizeri)

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　In Chikinhō, this is called tagarashi.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　There are very many varieties. Through my own examination, I consider this to be correct.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Listed in the Aquatic Plants section of Yamato Honzō.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Late third month of Mizunoto-Hitsuji year, copied at Usōan

According to Yamato Honzō:
　　In Kyoto dialect it is called
　　　takarashi or also
　　　tazeri
　　In Tsukushi it is called
　　　ushizeri
　　　ubazeri
　　In Wamyō Ruiju it is called
　　　fukadzumi

According to Wamyō Ruijushō:
　　Stone Dragon Mustard (fukatsumi)
　　　According to Honzō: Stone Dragon Mustard
　　　(Japanese name) Fukatsu-mi

According to Kyūkō Honzō:
　　Huihui garlic　(one name) water pepper and (another name) scorpion tiger grass

According to Zōho Tashikihen, Poisonous Plants section:
　　Stone Dragon Mustard (sekiryūzui)
　　　(Japanese name) Fukatsumi
　　　(Alternative names) Heavenly bean (Betsuroku)　Stone brain (same)
　　　(Supplementary alternative names) Ground mulberry (Honkei) Rokwanō (Betsuroku)
　　　　Water violet (Erya)
　　　　Bitter violet (same)
　　　　Violet mallow (Guo Pu)
　　　　Pepper vegetable (Kyūkō)
　　　　Peng root (Betsuroku)

According to Kyūkō Yafu:
　　　Oil-blazing (takarashi) grows by waterside with glossy leaves. There is also pepper vegetable (tarorashi), also called water violet.
　　　Zhou Xian Wang's Honzō refers to this. I believe the illustration of oil-blazing, though quite different in form,
　　　matches this. This is precisely the oil-blazing stone dragon mustard from the previous volume. The alternative name "pepper" uses that
　　　as its name, while "oil-blazing" is named for its color. I think these are three objects of one species with three names, which I consider most reasonable.
　　　Both illustrations are included in this volume.

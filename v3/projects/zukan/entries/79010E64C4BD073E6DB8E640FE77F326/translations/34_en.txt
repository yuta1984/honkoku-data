It is large with three-petaled flowers, and the root tubers are also plump. In the Bencao Gangmu, Shizhen states: "Water chestnut produces twelve offspring from one root each year, like a water chestnut nursing its many children. Hence it is so named." This is its constant nature. There is also something called "gowai" (Chinese name unknown) that grows in ponds and marshes. Its nature is the same as water chestnut, but both its form and root tubers are simply smaller - it is a variety of water chestnut.

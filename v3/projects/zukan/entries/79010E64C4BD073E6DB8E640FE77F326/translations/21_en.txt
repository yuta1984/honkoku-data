Shortia (shōjō-bakama) 《Chinese name unknown》 Grows in shaded, moist areas at the foot of mountains. Its leaves are pale green and do not
wither through winter, spreading on the ground and producing several leaves. In spring, it produces a short stem from the center, and at the stem
tip opens pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Young leaves grow beside the stem. During the period between summer and autumn,
the tips of old leaves touch the ground, produce roots, and reproduce by division.
Suzukake-sō 《Chinese name unknown》 In spring, it produces shoots from old roots. Both stem and leaves have
hair. In summer, it opens purple-blue flowers between the leaves, blooming in clusters. The stem grows long and diagonally,
reaching four to five shaku, and in autumn, when the stem tip touches the ground, it produces roots and thus propagates by division.

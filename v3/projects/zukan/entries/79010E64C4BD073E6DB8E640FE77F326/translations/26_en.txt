Baramu (Chinese name: details unknown)

It is planted in shaded and moist places everywhere and grows in clusters. Its roots creep horizontally underground with nodes. They are pale yellow in color. Both stems and leaves are dark green with longitudinal lines and luster. Five to six leaves grow in parallel from one root and do not wither even through winter. In summer, young buds emerge from the root tips.

Two to three leaves emerge from the left and right sides of the bract, and their shape roughly resembles bamboo shoots. At one year there is one leaf, and they gradually wither at five to six years. When buds emerge, flowers grow beside the lateral roots. They form tubes with eight petals of purple color. There are stamens inside the tube. Some emerge and bloom above ground, while others bloom underground. Later they bear fruit that appears above ground. They are deep blue in color, not round but four-angled with pointed ends, and the surface is rough and astringent. There are traces of stamens at the top.

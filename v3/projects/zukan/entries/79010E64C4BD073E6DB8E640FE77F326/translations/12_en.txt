Laifu (Radish) from "Bencao Gangmu (Compendium of Materia Medica)"
Seeds are sown in the eighth month, and germination occurs within twenty-four hours. The roots have fibrous roots, and eight or nine-tenths of these fibrous roots point north and south. This is its natural characteristic. By late spring of the following year, it extends flower stalks, opens four-petaled white-purple flowers, forms pods, and contains several seeds inside. Summer radish (kara-daikon) from "Jiajie Collection," Yang-flower radish (sangatsu-daikon) from "Jiangyin County Records," Water radish (moriguchi-daikon) from "Qunfang Pu," and others are all varieties of the same species, though many of their fibrous roots do not point north-south.

The Bencao Gangmu collection states: Shizhen said that gardeners cultivate radishes. They sow seeds in the sixth month, harvest seedlings in autumn, dig roots in winter, and by late spring extend tall stalks to open small flowers. The flowers are purple-blue in color, and pods form in early summer. The seeds are as large as hemp seeds, varied in their round-elongated shape, and yellow-red in color.

The Guang Qunfang Pu annotation states: Song is the name for the vegetable, while laifu is the name for the root. Some say it is named "laifu" (literally "coming to take") because its nature can counteract wheat toxicity, meaning it serves what wheat brings.

Dandelion (hokōei), tanpopo 《Bencao Gangmu》 grows wild everywhere in fields and along roadsides. Its leaves spread on the ground and flourish,
and in spring, yellow single-stem single-flowers bloom alternately between the early and late leaves. Such varieties are
so numerous they cannot be counted, so this is abbreviated.

The Bencao Shiyi states: Shizhen said that people today cultivate a type of grass with leaves like Zhanglan, evergreen throughout the four seasons, blooming purple flowers in summer and forming spikes, easy to propagate. It is also called jixiang grass (auspicious grass), but this is different from the jixiang mentioned here.

The Zunsheng Bazian states: Jixiang grass is easy to grow and can be planted anywhere - in soil, water, or on stones. However, having water is best, and when used to accompany solitary stones and lingzhi mushrooms, it is very pure. The flowers produce purple buds but do not easily bloom. If cultivated at home and it produces flowers, this seems to indicate good fortune.

The Runan Pushi states: Jixiang grass resembles daylily but is smaller, remaining verdant throughout the four seasons without withering. In the ninth month it opens small flowers, white inside and purple outside, like daphne.

The Tiantaishan Fangwai Zhi states: Guanyin grass grows among mountain rocks. When planted in a pot with clear water and sandy stones, it flourishes green, but withers when it touches mud.

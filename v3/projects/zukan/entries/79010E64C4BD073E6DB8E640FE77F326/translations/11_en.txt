Also, what is called "tendzutō (bean-wrapping vine)" according to Mizutani Toyobumi's research in "Kokon Ikan (Ancient and Modern Medical Mirror)" is actually one of its varieties. It grows in fields during summer. It wraps clockwise around soybeans, mung beans, and other plants, causing its roots to wither and shrivel. It has no leaves, is reddish in color like thread, and resembles dodder (nenashikadura). It opens tiny small flowers, forms seeds, and after autumn its vines wither and shrivel.

The Bencao Gangmu (Compendium of Materia Medica) collection states: Su Song said that nowadays it also exists in nearby areas, with those from Yuanqu considered superior. It produces shoots in summer, initially like fine thread, spreading across the ground, unable to rise by itself. When it encounters stems of other plants, it then wraps around and grows, its roots gradually disconnecting from the ground and dwelling suspended in air. Some say it has no roots and grows by borrowing qi (life force), which is indeed true.

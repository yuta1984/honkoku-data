that is incorrect. The kanoko-yuri (tiger lily) is
a separate species, which I will illustrate later.

Lily - Tiger lily - together

Natsusuki (summer transparency)

Oshiroi-bana (four o'clock flower)

Hōsenka (garden balsam)
Found again on the rear island

Purple mountain thorn (Onroi) from various texts

There are other varieties with white striped patterns
One type of flower that is

The Wakan Sansai Zue (Illustrated Sino-Japanese Encyclopedia) states in the grass section:
Oshiroi-gusa (white powder plant) - the correct characters are unclear
Oshiroi no hana
Herbalists say:
Sanyenshishika (mountain swallow finger flower)

　　　　　　　　　The Illustrated Sino-Japanese Encyclopedia, Wetland Grasses section states:
　　　　　　　　　　　　<<sumō-tori-kusa>>
　　　　　　　　　　　　Horn wrestling grass (chikara-kusa)
　　　　　　　　　　　　Blade grass - original name unknown
　　　　　　　　　　Children take the stems and tie them, binding the heads like hairpins, using two pieces
　　　　　　　　　　inserting one into the knot, with two people holding them and pulling the stems against each other, with the one that breaks
　　　　　　　　　　being the loser in this game. Commonly called wrestling grass. It grows luxuriantly on its own.
　　　　　　　　　　It becomes a hindrance to farming, and its roots are strong and difficult to pull out, hence named blade grass. Originally
　　　　　　　　　　calling violets horn wrestling grass, and pulling flowers against each other to determine victory -
　　　　　　　　　　the concept is the same.
　　　　　　　　　　There is one female variety with weak and soft stems and leaves, recorded in a later volume.

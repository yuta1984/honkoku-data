　　Those without thorns

　　　Hakukkusai (Kusano'ō)

Current common usage
　　　Kusa-no-ō　Kusano'ō flower

Wakan Sansai Zue, mountain plants section, states:
　　　Kusano'o (Ōkusa)　Common name, true name unknown
　　　　　　Also called Ōkusa (King Grass) - perhaps meaning "king of grasses"?

I say:
In the same book's wetland plants section,
Hakukkusai is listed

In Nōsei Zensho it states "stems and leaves are blue-green with white color,
stems have hair and thorns that branch and spread somewhat at the head," referring to those with four-petaled
yellow flowers. This is kusano'o. Are they listing one plant as two species?
Yamato Honzō lists it as Hakukkusai (Kusano'ō).

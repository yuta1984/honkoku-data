　　　　　　　Iris has been read as "shyaga" since ancient times. Iris is different from
　　　　　　　ichihatsu (another iris species). It belongs to the same family as kakitsubata 
　　　　　　　(rabbit-ear iris). Since shyaga is called butterfly flower,
　　　　　　　ichihatsu is called purple butterfly. Unlike ichihatsu, shyaga is planted
　　　　　　　leaning against the roof ridges of farmers' houses. The reason for this is unknown.

Kufu (Bitter Gourd) - Compendium of Materia Medica
[Nigahisago - Bitter Bottle Gourd]
It is poisonous. Seeds are sown in spring. The original species is of the same family as yugao (bottle gourd), and the vine, stem, and leaves are all the same as yugao. In summer evenings it opens five-petaled white flowers, which wither immediately by morning. This is also the same as yugao. It produces hisago (gourds). They are blue-green in color, with a very bitter smell and taste. They ripen in autumn.

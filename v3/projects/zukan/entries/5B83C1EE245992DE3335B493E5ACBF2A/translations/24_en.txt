Ya-u (Wild Taro) - Compendium of Materia Medica, Taro Supplement
　It has strong toxicity. It grows near the seashore in warm countries and fears cold. It produces leaves in summer. It resembles white taro (cultivated taro) but has a glossy appearance. The stem is shorter than that of white taro. The root also resembles white taro but is larger. If eaten by mistake, it causes distress and agitation, and in severe cases, leads to death. It is truly fearsome.
　Therefore, it has the names "poison taro" and "inedible taro."

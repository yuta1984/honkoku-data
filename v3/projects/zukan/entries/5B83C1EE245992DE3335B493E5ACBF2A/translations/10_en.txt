Yukimochi-sō (Snow cake plant)　《A variety of Arisaema｜Chinese name unknown》
　　It contains great poison. It grows in shaded valleys of deep mountains in spring. The independently emerging stem has no spotted markings. The leaves have three
　　leaflets per stem, pale green in color. The flower grows at the top of the stem, white with round stamens in the center. Its shape roughly resembles a Buddha's halo
　　(aureole), covering the stamens. Its toxicity is the same as Arisaema. It is a fearsome plant.

Kosho (Arisaema urashima) [Urashima-sō]　《Compendium of Materia Medica》
　　It contains great poison. It grows in shaded areas of deep mountains in spring. It resembles Arisaema, with round tuberous roots. The leaves are
　　like those of Arisaema heterophyllum and are long, with white spots on the stem. From within the flower, long stamens
　　emerge and reach the ground. If one mistakenly eats this, it is as fearsome as
　　Arisaema.

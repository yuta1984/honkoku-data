Shikin (Corydalis) - Compendium of Materia Medica
[Murasakikeman]
It has mild toxicity. It grows in shaded areas under trees in various places. It sprouts in autumn and grows on the ground in winter. The leaves resemble parsley leaves, being thin and soft, with purple-colored stems. In spring it extends stems about one shaku tall, opening purple flowers in clusters at the top. The form resembles the flowers of jirōbō (Corydalis turtschaninovii). Later it forms pods, and when they ripen, the pods split naturally when touched and the seeds fly out. After summer, both the seedlings and roots wither.

The leaves are like parsley leaves and have a whitish color. When cut, yellow sap emerges with a foul odor. In spring it extends stems and opens yellow flowers. They resemble the flowers of jirōbō (Corydalis turtschaninovii).

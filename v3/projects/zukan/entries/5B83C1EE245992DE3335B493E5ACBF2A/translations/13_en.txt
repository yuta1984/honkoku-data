Celery-leaf Kōfun (Giant Hogweed) [Ōzeri]　Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Cabinet
　It contains great poison. It grows in ponds and marshes in spring. The leaves resemble Angelica dahurica. In summer it blooms flowers similar to carrot flowers, white and small, clustering at the top of the stem. The stem is hollow inside, and large specimens can reach three to four shaku in height. If one mistakenly eats this, it leads to death. It is a fearsome thing.

Yōrō (Henbane) - Compendium of Materia Medica
[Omekikusa - Scopolia]
It is highly poisonous. It grows in secluded valleys of deep mountains. In spring it produces shoots from perennial roots, initially purple-black in color, becoming light green as it grows. Height is 1-2 shaku (30-60 cm). The leaves resemble those of shōriku (pokeweed) but are narrower and smaller. Between the leaves it opens tubular flowers with five-petaled tips like sha-shin (ladybell). After flowering it bears fruit. The root is like san-hi-kai (wild yam). If eaten by mistake, it causes madness and makes one run wildly. Hence it has the name "hashiri-dokoro" (running poison).

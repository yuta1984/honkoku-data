Arisaema (Jack-in-the-pulpit)　Compendium of Materia Medica
《Mountain konjac》
　　It contains great poison. It grows in shaded areas of deep mountains. Its root is a round tuber, with a single stem emerging independently, pale green in color with white spots. The leaves have
　　two stems, one stem is large and the other is small. In summer, it extends one stem and opens flowers. They are green with purple-
　　black streaks. There are also green varieties. In autumn when the leaves wither and the fruits ripen, they become
　　a beautiful red color. If one mistakenly eats this, the tongue and lips immediately swell and become distorted. It is a fearsome
　　plant. In the main entry of the Compendium, there is something called "yubatsu." One theory suggests it corresponds to "musashi-abumi,"
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　but this appears to be incorrect. Yubatsu is actually
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　the young root of Arisaema.

Musashi-abumi　《A variety of Arisaema｜Chinese name unknown》　　　Elephant head flower
　　　It contains great poison. It grows in shaded areas of deep mountains in spring. The independently emerging stem has white dots. The leaves grow alternately on two stems, with
　　　three leaves per stem that have a glossy surface. The flower grows at the top of the stem, green on the outside with white streaks. The inside is purple-black. After flowering,
　　　it forms fruit. In autumn when the leaves wither and the fruit ripens, it becomes red, resembling the fruit of Arisaema.
　　　Its toxicity is the same as Arisaema. It is a fearsome plant.

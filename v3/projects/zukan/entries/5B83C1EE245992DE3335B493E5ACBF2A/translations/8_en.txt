　　　mother, aconite is its child, and lateral roots grow beside the aconite. When aconite is cultivated without producing offspring
　　　and grows large, it is called "tenyū" (heavenly male). These are all names for roots. In the "Compendium of Materia Medica,"
　　　under the etymology of monkshood, it states: "Shizhen said that the juice of grass monkshood is extracted and processed into poison to shoot birds and beasts." In Ezo (Hokkaido),
　　　they harvest aconite and add spiders and capsicum (chili peppers), pound these together, boil them down to create
　　　a concentrated poisonous liquid which they apply to bamboo arrows to shoot birds and beasts. This is called "busumoto"
　　　or "tokinoya." One should understand the severity of this poison. What is called "shamō" (shooting net) in the "Compendium"
　　　refers to this.

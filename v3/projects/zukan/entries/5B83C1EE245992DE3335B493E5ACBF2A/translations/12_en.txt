Mansei Kōfun (Poison Ivy) [Tsuta-urushi]　Compendium of Materia Medica
　It contains great poison. It grows abundantly in mountains. It is a vine with fibrous roots that grows on trees and rocks. The leaf stems are red in color, with three leaves per stem. In autumn they turn red, then later wither and fall. In summer, small yellow flowers bloom between the leaves and bear fruit. The skin has hair on it. It is roughly like the fruit of Aralia elata. If one mistakenly eats this, the tongue and lips rot and fester, leading to death. It is a fearsome thing.

Herbaceous Ōsei-yō Kōfun (Veratrum) [Sawa-nasubi]　Compendium of Materia Medica, Kōfun Corrections
　It is extremely poisonous. It grows in deep mountains. In spring, shoots grow from old roots. The leaves resemble Solomon's seal and are soft, with three to four leaves growing alternately. The vertical veins are purple, and the stem is pale red. Four-petaled flowers hang downward between the leaves, pale green with black centers. After flowering, it bears fruit. If one mistakenly eats this, the tongue immediately splits and the lips fester, leading to death. If these leaves are picked and mixed into rice to feed mice, they die instantly. It is a fearsome thing. The woody Ōsei-yō Kōfun will be listed in the tree section of the later volume.

Narcissus (Suisen-ka)

The leaves resemble cattails. The flower shape is likened to "golden cup, silver platform" (kin-san gin-dai). The petals are six-fold, and the platform is triangular and long. The stem resembles yellow pond lily (kōhone). The flowers are wrapped in a thin silk-like bag at the tip, and the flower opens when the bag unfolds. The flower color is whitish with a slight pale yellow tint. In the center cup there are three orbs, and both the cup and three orbs are turmeric yellow. Flowers bloom from August until February or March of the following year. In autumn and winter narcissus, the flowers are positioned in the middle section of the leaves. Also, spring narcissus flowers, compared to the height of the leaves, generally follow the pattern that summer and autumn flowering plants have long stems, while winter and spring flowering plants have short stems. Four-season flowering plants continue throughout the year without interruption. However, while autumn and winter flowering plants struggle against the winter cold and wait for spring, the narcissus emerges from its thin silk bag with its golden cup and silver platform, not waiting for spring, and serves as a flower that creates connections and links with the spring flowers that are to come, bringing them together with its single cup.

○ Yang Chengzhai said: "The world calls narcissus 'golden cup, silver platform' because the single-petaled variety has one wine cup in the center, deep yellow and golden in color. The thousand-petaled variety is the true narcissus."

○ Shangu said: "One name is 'immortal bone' (senkotsu). Narcissus flowers are not ordinary flowers but have the appearance of immortal bones, hence they are called senkotsu."

△ Painting technique: For flowers, use gofun (white pigment) for the central lines in the same way, shade both sides of the central lines with white-green, for the fragrant cup, use gofun for the fragrant orbs, and shade the bottom with white-green. Also, for the entire flower, apply rokushō (verdigris) mixed with gofun. Apply ōō (yellow pigment) to both the central orbs and cup. For the platform leaves and axis, use light grass juice with fourth-grade sixth blue for shading, then apply ōō. For the bag wrapping the flower, apply gofun coating, then light yellow earth, apply scattered shading with vermillion ink, draw lines with vermillion ink. For the leaf base wrapping, use gofun and surikiri application. Draw lines with grass juice.

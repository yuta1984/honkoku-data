Lotus flower
(Also called) Kayō (lotus leaf)
(Also called) Fuyō (hibiscus)
(April through July)
Chinese lotus

The flowers are numerous, with tip-red, base-red, deep red, and white varieties. There are golden-thread lotus and silver-thread lotus, and Indian lotus with vein-like patterns visible on the petals.
The color is true red, with narrow petals, small details, and petals that fold inward like multi-petaled flowers. There are white varieties, and also white with lotus-red. There are large lotus with true red and white blooming separately. ○ Generally, lotus first produces floating leaves, second-layer leaves, and third-layer leaves, then produces flower buds. The leaves gradually flourish and the flowers open.
When flowers open, they fall and become seed pods. Floating leaves refer to those that float and drift on the water surface. Second-layer leaves are those that emerge next, rising slightly above the water surface and opening. Third-layer leaves refer to when rolled leaves stand up above the second layer. Third-layer leaves emerge, produce buds, leaves flourish, flowers open, and after flowering they fall and become pods. When painting lotus leaves, first make the leaves flourish, then arrange flowers slightly below the leaves. When painting lotus flowers, arrange leaves slightly below the flowers. When painting lotus, raise the lotus pods high and arrange both leaves and flowers slightly below.
Sometimes flowers are scattered and leaves wither and enter the water. Seeds from lotus pods fly and lodge in the soil. Buds emerge, flowers flourish, and pod seeds fly. These three represent past, present, and future.

Leaves emerge opposite each other, with round, large forms having wrinkles, resembling ground cherry plum leaves. The tree height exceeds one jō (about 3 meters), branches emerge on both sides extending in four directions, with flowers at the tips like temari balls. The petals are originally uniform, dividing into five. Each flower's shape is like white plum, with flowers clustered together. Sometimes like balls, flowers have gradations with no receptacle. Flowers start small and grow larger day by day. Initially they open blue, becoming white at their peak, with holes in the center.

There is something called "adoption" (yōshi) with kakitsubata. If you buy without careful examination, next year's flowers will be different. This is described in detail in the "Chikinshō." Though unnecessary to mention here, beginners consider it a flaw of kakitsubata when the flowers change the following year, so I record this.

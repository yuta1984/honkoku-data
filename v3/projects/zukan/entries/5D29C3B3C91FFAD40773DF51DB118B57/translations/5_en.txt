[Right folio]
Centipedes as large as carriages, spiders like dragons, butterflies like sails, mole crickets like oxen—a scroll of one shaku width cannot contain them all. The small ones—floating dust mites, sand lice, tiny midges, fine gnats—cannot be depicted even with the tip of a rabbit's whisker. How could one capture their living essence and apply colors to them? Zuiken laughed and said, "I simply drew what I observed, and accumulating them, they reached five volumes. I hope that following this volume, I will continue to supplement what is lacking." I truly recorded his words and made them into this preface.

Bunka 11 (1814), Year of the Wood Dog, 8th month, 3rd day
Written by Jigyo Hōgen, concurrent Supervisor of the Official Garden, Saien Shibue Kyū

[Left folio]
Court physician Kurimoto Hōgen presented me with one volume and requested a few words from me. Upon examining it, I found it to be illustrations of a thousand insects drawn from life by his own hand. The forms are minutely detailed, the colors vivid and bright, truly approaching reality. Hōgen has always been capable of distinguishing medicinal substances and natural products, and additionally enjoys analyzing various categories of flowers, birds, beasts, and insects. Indeed, his reaching this kind of scholarly work is also one of the skills of the medical profession. I too once enjoyed depicting natural objects, but those who merely enjoy something cannot match those who take pleasure in it. That Hōgen is not merely one who enjoys this work, but rather one who takes true pleasure in it. Moreover, his dedication to his official duties and commitment to the healing arts cannot be fully expressed in this preface.

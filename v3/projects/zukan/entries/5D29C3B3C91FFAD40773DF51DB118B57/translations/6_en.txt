[Right folio]
Again inscribing my self-painted insect manual
In Kansei kinoe-tora year (Zuiken), I humbly received the imperial command to lecture on pharmacology (honzō) at the medical school and concurrently examine and edit medicinal substances, which has now continued for eighteen years. I have come to know the names of many birds, beasts, grasses, and trees. However, while there is no shortage of such people in every generation, those who publish books and circulate them in the world could fill enough volumes to make oxen sweat from carrying them. Yet when it comes to those who compile insect categories, there are very few to be heard of. Is this not a deficiency in our literature? During my spare time from official and private duties, I kept this in mind, and whenever I obtained an insect, I would raise it in captivity, draw it from life with my own hand, categorize it, and add explanations—this too for eighteen years. By now, the illustrated explanations have finally filled my document boxes. Therefore, I organized them into two volumes. On both front and back sides are depicted insects, each with individual explanations, reaching a thousand in number. Fellow enthusiasts who study the insect section may find this illustrated manual provides some small assistance.

He has even made paintings as supplements and established them as family traditions. These paintings of a thousand insects are precisely one such example. Anyone who observes them can surely comprehend how extraordinary his years of dedicated effort have been. Particularly regarding the yù creature mentioned in the Book of Poetry...

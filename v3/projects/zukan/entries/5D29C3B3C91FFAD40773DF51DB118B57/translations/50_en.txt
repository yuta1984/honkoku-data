Maple Silkworm Cocoon: This is the nest of the tegus insect. There are two types. The pupa can be seen transparently inside the mesh bag. One type has weak cocoon silk with fine mesh patterns and is reddish-black in color. Rural farmers take this nest and put it on their fingertips to pick tea leaves. They say their fingertips don't hurt and don't get tired. It's commonly called "sukidawara." Rural children put fireflies inside this nest, and the light shines through transparently to the outside. Therefore it's called "firefly bag."

Heavenly Silkworm Cocoon: This is the empty shell left after transforming into a butterfly and breaking through the mouth of the cocoon to emerge. This moth has a large form. There is a separate diagram.
　　　　　　　　　This creature's (heavenly silkworm) cocoon is larger than that of wild silkworms, and the silk is firm and resilient. In China, they split open the abdomen to extract the silk before this insect attempts to build its nest. This is namely heavenly silkworm silk (tegus).

Celery-leaf Gelsemium Insect: Self-collected and drawn on the 23rd day of the intercalary 8th month, year of Hinoe-ne
This is a poisonous plant called "Kigeman" in common parlance. In Gōshū (Ōmi) it's called "Hebi-ninjin" (snake carrot), in Doshū (Tosa) "Oba-koroshi" (grandmother killer), and in Seshū (Ise) "Hitokoe-yobori" (one-voice caller). If one chews this leaf raw and drinks the juice, one immediately vomits bloody phlegm, cries out "wah!" once, and dies suddenly. Hence it has the name "one-voice caller."

The large-leafed variety has leaves tinged with white color, and withstands frost and snow in winter and spring without withering. In the second and third months, it extends stems of about one to two shaku and forms ears, opening flowers. They are yellow, no different from violet flowers. When the stem is cut, yellow juice emerges with an extremely foul odor. This juice is especially highly toxic.

The small-leafed variety has a common form but with pointed leaf tips, and the same toxicity. It grows between roadside tree shade and sunny stone walls.

What the Daikan Honzō calls "violets with yellow flowers that harm people" is this plant. What the Kinki Yōryaku refers to as "gelsemium resembles celery leaves, and mistakenly eating it kills people" is also this very plant. The theory that identifies it with a type of large celery called "poison celery" is incorrect. This plant's toxicity is fierce and violent. It is indeed the celery-leaf gelsemium. It sometimes grows wild in gardens. One should quickly dig it up, dig deep into the earth, and bury it away.

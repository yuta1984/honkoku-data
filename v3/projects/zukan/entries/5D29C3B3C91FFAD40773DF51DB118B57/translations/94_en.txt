　　　　　　　　　　　　　Insects that attach to roses and eat the leaves,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　with flattened bodies　August 2nd

They are poisonous, and if their hairs touch a person's collar or hands and pierce the skin,
red swelling spreads and causes severe pain. In early August,
they sometimes spin silk threads down from their mouths. Their hair is white, and though their form is small,
the harm they cause is severe.

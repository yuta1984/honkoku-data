Firefly-like insect
This is the same insect captured and drawn fourteen years ago on the 27th day of the 6th month of Bunka 5, year of the Dragon (1808). It was the day when the hottest period of summer began.

The overall body is hard. The six legs are short. When it folds its legs and hides them against its belly with antennae extended, it remains motionless, resembling a click beetle. It is flatter than a click beetle. When the legs are folded against the belly, it looks as if carved from wood. It has no luminescence. Upon close inspection, there are fine stripes. The antennae are very soft with horizontal segmented patterns. When touched by human hands, it folds its six legs and appears dead.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Salamander　This is the black fish from "Butsuri Shōshiki" 《Small text: Echizen | Echigo》Commonly
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　called "Sengan-mushi" (thousand kan insect). Its belly underneath is purple-red, hence also
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　called "red-belly." Living
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　specimens are things that
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　people never see.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Its movement is slow.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　It lives in clear springs,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　different from newts that
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　live in stagnant water.

This is a product from
the lake waters of Hakone. The dried
specimens are sold at
apothecaries as
male-female pairs.
The female has
a large belly with eggs.
For children's five gan diseases, it is soaked in sake and roasted
to make it fragrant before use. It is also used for consumption cough,
and its efficacy is said to be
no less than that of gecko.

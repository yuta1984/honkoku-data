There is a very small grub (beetle larva).
Around the summer solstice, it pupates in the soil.
It is wrapped in thin skin, as shown in the
illustration. I do not know what kind of insect
it is, but when placed on the soil surface for four or
five days, one morning it molts again and
transforms into a small beetle.
Initially the color is white,
　　　　　gradually
it shines pale green, and within a day
the entire body becomes black
and the back changes to green.
When it takes on a golden hue,
it flies well.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Thin skin

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Longhorn beetle　When it emerges after molting, the color is white, brittle,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　and soft. After being exposed to wind for about half a day,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　it changes to yellowish-brown, as shown in the
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　illustration. Afterwards it becomes pure black
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　with a lacquer-like
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　luster.

This is a fly found on the bark of the Chinese parasol tree. Compared to ordinary ones, its form is extremely small. What is depicted here in large illustration
is the size when observed through a microscope. It has spotted patterns on its wings and is beautiful.

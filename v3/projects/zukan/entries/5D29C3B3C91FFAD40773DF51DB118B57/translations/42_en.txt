In the fourth month of the Year of the Monkey in the Kyōhō era, what was brought by the captain Yin Xinyi of the fifth Ningbo ship was presented to the shogunate in Edo by Miyake Suō-no-kami, the Nagasaki magistrate,
and was viewed by the shogun. This was the beginning of cordyceps being brought to Japan. At this time, the interpreter Jōjō Tōjiuemon submitted a written report as follows:
"Cordyceps is produced in the mountains of the Zewang region, more than a thousand ri west of Shaanxi. The grass resembles onion shoots, with one stem protruding from the insect's
head, about two to three sun in length. This is grass that grows in summer months, which is what was collected."

　　　　Cordyceps (Winter worm, summer grass)

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Ground bee 《Interlinear note: One type with black color and pale yellow horizontal stripes｜In the third and fourth months, it bores holes in the soil to enter》

Curled hair like a scorpion (kenpatsujokkatsu)
Carpenter bee, also called hornet. Large in form and enters
flowers to suck nectar. When a person approaches nearby, the sound of its wings is powerful
and frightening. When captured, its stinging poison is also extremely fearsome.
The "Book of Songs" (Shijing), Minor Odes says "curled hair like a scorpion," and the Mao commentary states: "The tip of the tail is like a woman's
hair, with the end curved and coiled upward."
If this is so, then this is indeed that creature.

In the "Illustrated Investigation of Plants and Animals in the Mao Poetry" compiled by
Oka Genpō of Osaka, using a scorpion
to represent this and presenting that illustration is an error.

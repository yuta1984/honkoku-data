Seahorse - A rare product from Ryukyu - Dragon Palace Horse - Tatsu-no-otoshigo
　This is the sea dragon recorded in the "Taiwan Prefecture Gazetteer." The book states: "Sea dragons are found in Penghu Bay. On winter days, they leap in pairs onto the beach. Fishermen capture them and call them treasures. Their head and tail resemble a dragon but have no fangs or claws. They are less than one shaku in length. When used in medicine, their efficacy is double that of seahorses." Sun Yuanheng wrote a poem saying: "The fishermen of Peng Island request my song, sea dragons leap forth in pairs from the swirling vortex, claws and fangs not yet formed, only scales and mane in vain, just like dried fish weeping as they cross the river."

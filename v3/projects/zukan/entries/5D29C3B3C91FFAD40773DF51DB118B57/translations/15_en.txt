Honeybee nests are built vertically, with connecting pillars called partitions between them. Here is a diagram showing a cross-section viewed from the side. Newly constructed nests are white with a yellowish tinge. Those not yet filled with honey are called empty nests (karasu), and those already filled with honey are called candy nests (amesu). These are filled with honey from both sides. Nests that are about a year old change to brown color. When wax is produced, new nests are white in color, middle-aged ones have a slight yellow tinge, and old ones become burnt tiger-yellow (brownish) color.

Beeswax is wax extracted from honeybee nests. Newly made nests are white in color, becoming white wax. Those that have aged for days and months are yellow in color. Those that have aged for years and become old are tiger-yellow (brownish). The extraction method: crush the nest by hand, put it in a copper pot with equal parts water, boil over high heat, and stir with chopsticks until the nest completely dissolves. Prepare cold water in a separate ceramic vessel, and using a horsehair sieve (suinou),

strain it into the water mentioned above. The wax will congeal and float on the water surface. Scoop this up and collect it, put it in a medicated porcelain bowl, and steam it in a water bath until it congeals into one lump. This is used in surgical medicine, added to ointments.

Izu Province, Yatsushiro District. In the valley of Usaguchi Mountain, there is Tsuruse Bridge. To the right of the bridge is a notice board with characters of Jizo Bodhisattva painted in ink by Kose Kanaoka. Following the stream upstream for several dozen steps, only red cliffs are visible and no sacred statue can be seen. When one draws water with a ladle and washes the stone surface, after a while a benevolent image clearly appears, as if seen through heavy fog. All companions marveled at this miraculous transformation. In that water there are black, wriggling things. One might think they are perhaps small snails. When playfully picked up, they turn out to be stones. Their shape is square, less than one bu in size, and longer than half a sun. The upper part is full and the lower part tapers. However, it was unclear why they moved and wriggled. Taking twenty or thirty pieces and carrying them in sleeves to the inn, when accidentally taken out and examined, what was thought to be stones were crawling and walking again. Everyone was again amazed by this strangeness. Upon close examination, they have heads and feet. The heads and feet are black and shiny, while the body is white. Their form resembles wheat insects that have not yet transformed into small moths. Upon further investigation, those square, stone-like things are shells made by binding together stone fragments. This is a type of sekito (stone borer) that is particularly rare.

Water jellyfish - This creature occasionally drifts to Shinagawa's sea as well. On its underside are four legs that grow from the very center. About five to six bu in size, it is not suitable as food. When touched by hand, it has stings that pierce like needles. After a while, swelling and pain appear. Since it is poisonous, it should be discarded and not touched. It is about one sun thick and transparent like kuzu starch jelly.

Frog　Also called "Long-thighed." Zong Shi said:
　　Because frogs have long legs,
they are good at jumping. Those with loud voices are
called "ka" (frogs), and those with small voices are called "kō" (toads).

Golden Jacket Frog《Marginal note: Kajika-gaeru | Ide-no-kawazu》
This is what Wu Rui described in the Bencao Gangmu (Compendium of Materia Medica).
It inhabits the clear streams of the western mountains. They are abundant in the rivers of Kyoto,
especially in Yase, which is famous for them. In form, they are
slightly larger than tree frogs, with rashes on their backs, and reddish-black in color.
Some are also brown with black spots. Every night they emerge onto rocks
to sing. When one calls, the entire clan calls together. Their voice is clear and bright with much
modulation. Those that repeat seven times are considered superior. Enthusiasts keep live specimens
in special containers. In midsummer, when water is sprinkled and high-pitched flutes are played, they invariably vocalize. The way their form
differs from ordinary frogs is that their limbs are thin with long thighs, and their eyes protrude high. They are fed flies caught throughout the four seasons, and after two or three
years of survival, some have voices that ring especially high and far. This is what the "stone-scaled fish" in the Min Tongzhi and the "valley rainbow" in the Fuzhou
Prefectural Gazetteer refer to. There is also a fish called kajika that also makes sounds, but this is different from that.

Shōzō notes that in the Bencao Gangmu's collected explanations on toads, Wu Rui said: "These are long-thighed stone toads. Also called golden jacket frogs. They are found in mountain valleys in the sixth and seventh months. Their nature and taste are the same as water toads."
Some have reddish-brown coloring with more distinct black spots. What is illustrated here is the blackish variety. The form is thin with long
thighs, and the front legs are small. The eyes protrude high.

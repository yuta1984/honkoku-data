Brief Preface to the Kurishi Insect Compendium

Dongbi (Li Shizhen) said: "All creeping and moving creatures possess spiritual essence, each having its own nature and vital energy. Recording their benefits and clarifying their toxicity was something the ancient sages distinguished in detail." Creatures like cicadas, fireflies, ants, and earthworms that can be used for food are mentioned in the Book of Rites, while centipedes, snails, toads, and scorpions that can be used for medicine are recorded in medical texts. Should not those who practice medicine investigate the principles of nature and examine the beneficial and toxic properties of these creatures? Therefore, I gathered various insects and kept them, and in my spare time from medical practice, I drew them from life. As the seasons change, the species differ, and over a long period I accumulated drawings of over one hundred species. I then pasted them in albums, classified them by type with attached explanations, and included even those creatures that previous scholars had not yet illustrated, omitting none. Indeed, insects are the most minute among living creatures, and their varieties are extremely numerous. What I have illustrated here also embraces this abundance without avoiding complexity, serving as an aid to broad learning. I hope that viewers will not ridicule this work for pursuing breadth without knowing restraint.

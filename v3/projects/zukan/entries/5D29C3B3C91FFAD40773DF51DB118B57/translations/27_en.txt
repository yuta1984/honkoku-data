Fennel Insect (Uikyō no Mushi)　　Like the citrus borer, this has yellow bifurcated horns that it extends. Those that attach to aromatic herbs such as angelica (danggui), angelica dahurica (baizhi), Sichuan lovage (chuanxiong), etc., all have the same form, with red spots on their sides. Those that attach to fennel have yellow spots. These are the ones that later pupate and become swallowtail butterflies.

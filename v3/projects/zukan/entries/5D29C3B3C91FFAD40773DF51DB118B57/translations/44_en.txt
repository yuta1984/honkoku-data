Kōhichū (Dog-spleen insect)
This insect prefers to crawl on longan trees, is about the size of a small cicada, hemp-colored with a carapace. It has a very foul odor, and its secretions can cause human flesh to fester.
Also, according to the "Teikei Keibutsu Ryaku" (Imperial Capital Scenic Objects Record), there is a type of insect that grows on stink trees called chūshō (stink bug), which when touched emits a foul smell that assaults the nose - this is the very same creature.
Common names: Hōhanniu, Kauramushi, Katakinu
Aizu dialect: Baibukurin

Biwa-semi (Lute Cicada)
This is also a type of cicada that likes to gather on longan trees. Its body shape resembles a lute, colored blue-green with red-yellow spotted patterns, but it cannot sing.
The above two descriptions are from the "Kōyō County Records." The illustrations of these two insects were drawn by Chinese people. Though I do not know whether they are accurate, I include them here tentatively, awaiting detailed evaluation by learned scholars.

Kori (grain weevil) - "Erya" annotation: Tsunomushi (Izumi), Yonamushi (Bizen), Komemushi (Kyoto), Hori (Sendai)
Also called: Kyōyō
Also called: Rice insect
In "Santang Shikō" called kokugō, in "Seijitsū" called koshi
These are the small black insects found in rice - Kokuuzō (Edo dialect)

When viewed through a microscope, they appear this large
"Seijitsū" also states: Today's small black insects in grain have small wings and appear when grain becomes old and damp. Commonly called koku-koshi. The "ko" in kori should follow the character for "ko." In "Seimin Yōjutsu," grain insects are called kyokō, which are the same as kori.

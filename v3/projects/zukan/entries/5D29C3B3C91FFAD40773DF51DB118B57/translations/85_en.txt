Warekara (Skeleton Shrimp)
According to Kaibara-ō's theory, it is a small shell and not an insect. This is probably based on the local dialect of fishermen and others in that region who call it "warekara." Therefore, this creature differs from region to region. What is illustrated here should be the warekara as it is called in Tsukushi (Kyushu).

The Yamato Honzō states: "The warekara mentioned in ancient poems is an insect that lives in seaweed." Also, the Honzō Yakugen says: "Purple laver has small spiral shells within it." Upon examination, this type should be warekara. There are spiral shells that are like shell fragments attached to seaweed. This probably means "split shell" because they lack an operculum. {{These are small versions of yome-gasara (literally "bride's dish")}} It also says: "Warekara are small shells that live in seaweed in the sea. They are mentioned in ancient poems. Their color is pale black, their size does not exceed three to four bu. Their shells break easily. Their shape resembles miso-gai and such. They are extremely small. This seaweed is called nagoya. It is pale blue in color, purple when dried. When exposed to sunlight, it changes to white. It is edible but not of good quality. Sometimes this shell is also found in pine seaweed. Pine seaweed is long with thick stems." {{This is also another theory, referring to small karasu-gai (crow shells). This is the wu-ren mentioned in Min-shu, which is the wu-nian of Zhangzhou Prefecture records}}

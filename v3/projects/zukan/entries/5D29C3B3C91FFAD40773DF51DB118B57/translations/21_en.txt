They are placed on shelves and celebrated. Therefore, it is difficult for pharmacies to obtain them in large quantities. Consequently, unscrupulous merchants specifically raise silkworms from the beginning to counterfeit this substance. Before making these stiff silkworms, when the entire body turns golden yellow and the throat becomes transparent, they put them in pots, roast them to death, dust them with lime, and sun-dry them. Most pharmacies are said to profit from these counterfeit white stiff silkworms. The genuine ones are naturally white as if moldy, and when broken, they are hard and transparent like amber - these should be considered authentic. Those that are excessively white like beaten powder, and when broken contain silkworm droppings and are black in color, are not extremely hard - these should be known as not genuine. The Bencao Huiyan states: "When silkworms fall ill from wind and die, their bodies become directly stiff, their color naturally white, dead yet incorruptible. Today's markets mostly use silkworms that died from dampness, or use lime powder mixed to make them white - consuming these causes the deepest harm and one cannot be too cautious." Also, the Tiangong Kaiwu says: "If there is wind, they particularly fear the southwest; when southwest winds blow strongly, there are cases where entire trays become stiff." The Benjing Fengyuan states: "For medicinal use, only select the straight ones as superior, remove black mouths and silk, and use roasted." ○ Black rotten silkworms are called "tariko" in Ōmi Province, referring to those that have turned black and rotten. These are sometimes mixed into white stiff silkworms, so they should be carefully selected and removed. ○ Silkworm molts are called "kaiko no kinu" - these are the skins shed each time silkworms sleep. They have names like snake molt or horse bright molt. They are used medicinally in Tang China. Japanese medicine does not use them. ○ The Japanese name for wild silkworms is natsugo. They also have names like late silkworm, Wei silkworm, summer silkworm, hot silkworm, etc. The Zhengzi Tong names them 蝩. Around mid-June, the eggs laid by spring silkworms (harugo) are initially white in color and round in shape with a slight point on the head. After about three days, the color changes to yellow and the shape becomes flat and concave.

After about four more days, the color changes to light black with a slight purple tinge. After more days pass, the head becomes pointed and changes to black, gradually becoming completely black. After one day, they pierce the egg and the larvae emerge. From this point they gradually grow, sleeping and waking four times before making cocoons and transforming into moths, same as spring silkworms. Only their development is faster. For medicinal use, both the larvae and their droppings are used. In Edo they are called "nido-gaeri" (second return). Shizhen says: "According to Zheng Xuan's commentary on the Zhouli, 'yuan' means 'again,' referring to those raised twice. Zongshi said: 'Yuan has the meaning of restoration and swiftness.' Song said: 'Wild silkworms are raised extensively in southeastern prefectures; these are those raised repeatedly, commonly called late silkworms. Northern people do not raise them much.'" I once raised these creatures. These silkworms are poorly behaved and do not stay only on the trays. They crawl up to house corners and, without waiting for frames to be provided, crawl onto sliding doors and corners to make cocoons. Two silkworms enter one cocoon, or three to four silkworms enter one cocoon. Their cocoons are soft, thin, and flat. Their nature is poor and they do not make strong silk; though all are made into cotton, their nature is weak. There are black crow pills and square medium late silkworm larvae, which also enter golden elixir pills. Their ability to quickly re-emerge is taken as their virtue. Though it says to select male larvae for medicinal use, it is difficult to obtain only males. Both male and female should be used. Fresh ones should be selected. Generally, female silkworm larvae have their abdomens full of eggs from the beginning. After mating they can lay eggs, and these eggs can grow well. ○ Silkworm droppings are called "kokusu" in the Wamyōshō. Wild silkworm droppings are natsugo no kuso. The Gujin Yitong calls them by the alternate name "horse neigh liver." The Chengzhai Yichao Cuoyao has the name "summer golden sand." The Bencao Huiyan says "Silkworm droppings are silkworm excrement; those from late silkworms are good." The Benjing Fengyuan states: "Use lightly roasted; only late ones are good. Early silkworms are not suitable for medicine because they are fed with fire-dried [leaves] and thus are toxic." Here I have a remarkable formula from my notes. I present it here: Silkworm...

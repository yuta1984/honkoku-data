Tsuchi-kaburi (Earth Cap)

Illustration from Kanko. According to the Mushroom History, when the cap expands and becomes large, it reaches from 7-8 sun to over 1 shaku. It has a concave surface with thick flesh, short legs, and deep gills - this is the most refined of mushrooms. It is pure white or has a grayish-black tinge, and there are also yellow varieties.

Oshōnin (Shinano Province)　Ushinohitai
　Rōshi (Eastern Mino)　Rōjin (Western Mino)

This is a figure recorded in "Shin'yō Kinfu." The same book states that "rōshi" is an abbreviation of "old person," referring to an ox's forehead, and "rōjin" is named after its shape. "Oshōnin" was eaten in Ina District in the past. It is said that a high priest of the Nichiren sect first ate this and declared it non-poisonous, thus giving it this name, though the truth of this is unknown. It is presumably black with a white underside, has a bitter taste, and pale flesh. When roasted and cut, its shape resembles abalone. When mixed with grated radish and vinegar, it is said to be most delicious.

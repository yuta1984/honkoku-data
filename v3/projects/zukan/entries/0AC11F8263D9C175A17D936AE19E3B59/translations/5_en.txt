　This plant commonly grows attached to decayed roots under trees in both residential areas and mountain fields. Initially, it produces a single stem with a shape like the head of a writing brush, gradually developing a cap resembling cloud formations. Small ones

　measure several inches, while large ones reach up to one foot. The entire body has a lacquer-like luster. Even after years pass, it does not decay. There are substances that attach to the sides of the stem and cap, and some also attach inside the cap. The forms are not uniform. Although the Jijie describes several hundred varieties of forms, I have not included illustrations of those I have not personally observed or for which there are no diagrams or descriptions by predecessors or colleagues, so I do not illustrate them. I await future research. The variations are extremely diverse and cannot be exhaustively catalogued. For long-term storage of this plant, fresh specimens should be briefly steamed in a steamer and then air-dried for several days, which prevents decay and enables long-term preservation. Without this treatment, they cannot avoid being eaten by insects. Regarding their colors, purple ones are most common, while black ones are deeply purple varieties. There are also red ones, and yellow ones are pale red varieties. Blue ones are pale purple varieties. White ones are extremely rare.

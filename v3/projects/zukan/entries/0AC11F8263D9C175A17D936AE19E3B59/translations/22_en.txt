Persimmon mushroom (kakitake)

Illustration from the Kanka. According to the Kinshi (Mushroom History), they are plump like hatsutake mushrooms and as large as a tea bowl, with yellow-white-green coloring and gray stems. These, along with the previous two varieties, are edible, though the taste is said to be not particularly good.

Alder mushroom (hannokinotake)

Illustration from the Kanka. According to the Kinshi, they resemble enokitake mushrooms but are thin and small, with yellow-brown-white coloring and quite good flavor. There are also varieties with large caps and thin stems, gray on top and white underneath, with fifty to sixty stems growing in clusters from a single root. What is sold in markets as enokitake may sometimes be mixed with these mushrooms.

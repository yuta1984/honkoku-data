Shiitake

This is a figure recorded in "Kanka." According to the "Kōwa Kinfu," white ones are called kochō, red ones are called kuchō, and black ones are called tecchō, and these varieties also produce shiitake. Those growing on cut stump tops and on leaning oak trees are similar to kashitake. It is said that seven out of ten of what are commonly called shiitake today are actually kashitake.

In the "Kinshi," it states that from the third and fourth months until early autumn, they grow in mountain areas on the roots of chinquapin trees and on rotten stumps. The surface is purplish-black, while the rim and stem are all white, with a fat head and thin legs. The texture is extremely hard and the aroma is unparalleled. They are found in the mountain areas around Kyoto. Also, in autumn, white oak and various oak trees are cut to about three shaku in length, soaked in water, and after one night, they are carried and crushed with an axe to make holes, then placed in shaded areas. Eventually, after a long time, fungi grow. The shape and taste are almost the same as shiitake, and these are called cultivated shiitake.

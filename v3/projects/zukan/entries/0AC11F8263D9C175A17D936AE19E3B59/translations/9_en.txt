Wood Channel Ganoderma (Mokukyoshi) 《From Jikai (Collected Explanations)》

　This specimen is something treasured by the assistant head priest of Yuima-in temple within the monastery compounds of Tōeizan. Its form has roots about the size of one handful, with one stem dividing into several branches growing in clusters, approximately two shaku in length. At the head of each stem is a flat cap. The way this cap attaches straight to the stem is like a ladle. This differs from other ganoderma that form umbrella shapes. The color is purple-black, with the entire surface having a lustrous quality as if lacquered. It can be called a rare specimen. It belongs to the category of Mokukyoshi described in the Jikai.

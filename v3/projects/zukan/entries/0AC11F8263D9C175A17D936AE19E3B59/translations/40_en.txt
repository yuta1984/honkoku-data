Chōkōshin (Viscous Oil Mushroom) "Shūkai" - Aburashimeji
　　Numeributake, Numerishimeji, Numetake

This is a drawing recorded in "Kinshi" (Mushroom Chronicle). In "Kōwa Shinfu" (Imperial Japanese Mushroom Manual), this is also described as Gyokushin (jade mushroom) or shiroshimeji (white shimeji mushroom) (omitted). It grows in the mountains of Zaihara in Shimōsa Province and flourishes during the autumn months. According to "Kinshi," it spreads its cap like the yellow shimeji but is larger, with a yellow-brown surface and very deep gills. Both cap and stem are white in color, viscously smooth like oil, slightly soft and delicately flavored, well-suited for making soup. It grows under trees in shaded mountains and among miscanthus and purple grass. It is said to be abundant in Izumi and other provinces. I tasted what is called himeshitake in Shimura, Musashi Province, and found its flavor excellent.

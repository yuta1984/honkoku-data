　　Minoyukitake (Western provinces)

This is a figure recorded in "Shin'yō Kinfu." The same book states that when sun-dried and eaten, it is considered high grade.

Minoshishitake

This is a figure recorded in the same book. In "Kinshi," when compared to shishitake, it is somewhat smaller, and the dorsal surface has hair-like spines all over, roughly resembling the form of a straw raincoat. Hence it was so named. A person from Shinano province once presented this to me as a gift.

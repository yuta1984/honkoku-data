Hatsutake (Lactarius hatsudake)

　This mushroom grows in early autumn under pine trees in mountains and fields throughout the provinces. While the shape is uniform, there are several varieties of color. The taste is sweet and delicious. When harvested and left overnight or touched by hand, both the upper and lower surfaces turn copper-green in color. It is also prone to insect infestation. In recent years, people select soil from places where hatsutake grow, or choose specimens whose caps have expanded and matured, scatter them on moist ground under pine trees, and pour rice-washing water on them daily to cultivate them. This is considered a delicacy.

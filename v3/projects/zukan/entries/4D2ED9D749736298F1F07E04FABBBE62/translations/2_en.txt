Preface to the Honzō Zufu (Illustrated Manual of Materia Medica)

Nothing is more beloved by people than life, and nothing is more abhorred than death. What else but medicine can spare people from regret at times of illness and matters of life and death? The way of medicine bears responsibilities that are extremely weighty and urgent. In the practice of treatment, without relying on medicinal substances, one cannot achieve efficacy. The urgency and necessity of medicinal substances to medicine is like soldiers to a general. If these are lacking, even the most skilled general or divine physician can only stand by helplessly and wait for the patient's demise.

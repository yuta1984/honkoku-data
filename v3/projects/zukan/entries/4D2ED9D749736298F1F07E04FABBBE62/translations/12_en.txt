The Fukushū variety has small, pointed leaves. The roots form vine-like structures that spread horizontally, producing buds from the nodes. The color is pale yellow, and the taste is sweet.

In spring, it sprouts from perennial roots. The leaves have a slightly rough texture, and the stems grow to a height of 1-2 shaku. Old roots produce flowers and fruits.

The Nanking variety has thick taproots with dark yellow bark and a very sweet taste.

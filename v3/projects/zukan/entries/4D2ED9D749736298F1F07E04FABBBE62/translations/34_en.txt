Red Arrow Gastrodia (Gastrodia elata)　Common name: "nusubito no ashi" (thief's foot)

It grows in mountains and fields throughout the provinces in the fourth month. Where it grows this year, it will not grow the next year. When the shoots are 5-6 sun tall, if you dig and harvest them, the roots are substantial. When it grows tall, it reaches 3-4 shaku in height, forms spikes at the tips, and opens yellow flowers. The shape resembles ginseng but is larger. It forms pods below the flowers, containing yellow powder inside.

There is one variety with green stems and white flowers. According to one theory, this corresponds to the "御風草" (gofūsō) mentioned in Raigaku's theory, but since gofūsō is said to have white leaf backs, this identification is not appropriate.

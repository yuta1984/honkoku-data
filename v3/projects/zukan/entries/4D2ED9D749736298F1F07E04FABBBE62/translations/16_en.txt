Annual plants

In the third year of Genbun era, ginseng seeds arrived from Korea and were cultivated in Tsuga County, Shimotsuke Province. When the seeds are first planted and germinate, they produce one stem with three leaves. In the second year, they branch into two forks, with each branch bearing five leaves. In the third and fourth years, they branch into three forks with five leaves and bloom white flowers in the center. The fruit is flattened, green when unripe, and turns red when ripe. Inside are two to three seeds. The roots that grow large over the years develop five or seven branches, and the flower spikes also produce branches.

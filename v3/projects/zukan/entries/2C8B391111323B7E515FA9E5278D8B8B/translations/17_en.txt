　Found beside the paths of fields and paddies and in ditches. In spring
　it grows from seeds. Height is 1-2 shaku. The stems are weak and
　droop to the ground. The leaves resemble buckwheat but are longer and
　alternately arranged. Between summer and autumn it branches and has flowers.
　Like kōhanki (ishimikawa), when first unopened
　they are red in color, and as they reach full bloom they turn white
　in color. The seeds are three-ridged and small. After frost,
　both leaves and roots wither. Also the stems, leaves, and flowers
　are the same as bitter buckwheat (mizosoba), and those with small
　round leaves on the stem have thorns.
　They are of the same type as kōhanki (ishimikawa) and shakyō (unagitsukami)
　and are different from the previous entry. One variety has
　black markings in the shape of the character "eight" on the leaves,
　resembling kokukisō (hachimandate).

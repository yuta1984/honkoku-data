One variety: Large Job's tears

　The shape is like two or three Job's tears (juzudama) combined together, with chrysanthemum patterns. In the Oyama area of Sagami Province, it is called the parent bead of Job's tears. This is mentioned in the Jijie section of the Bencao Gangmu, where Hongjing states: "Those from Jiaozhi have the largest seeds, and in that land they are called ganzhu. Therefore, when Ma Yuan was in Jiaozhi, he ate these and brought them back as seeds, but people slandered him saying they were pearls. Those with heavy, clustered fruits are considered good quality, and the kernels are extracted for use." Also, according to Lei Xiao's theory: "When using them, do not use the chaff. When the grains are large and tasteless, people of the time call them genkan. This is it." In the Shiming, it is called yimi.

　Seeds are sown in autumn and germinate, surviving through winter without withering. The stem height is four to five shaku. The leaves resemble lettuce with serrations and are powder-green in color. In the third and fourth months, stems extend with alternate growth. From the tip of branches or between leaves, they branch out, forming blue bracts on the stems that hang downward. Gradually, as the flower prepares to open, it faces upward, the bract falls off, and the flower opens. It has four petals with yellow stamens in the center. Single-flowered varieties open in the morning and both stamens and petals fall together in the evening. Double-flowered varieties fall after two or three days. After some time, the fruit grows large, and the top of the pod resembles a chrysanthemum flower. Inside are many small seeds; seeds from white flowers are white in color, while those from red-purple flowers are black.

　glutinous millet

【Left page】
There are three varieties: early, medium, and late ripening.
Seeds are sown in early summer. The grains are fine and small,
without hairs, and of a deep yellow
color. Among these, white millet,
also called gozen-awa,
has small grains and white color. According to old theories,
it corresponds to hakuryō (white millet) in the
collected commentaries on ryō (millet), but since it is glutinous,
it is now classified here. The Kai-i-kō states:
"It has keikō (fine essence) and its white color
is like silver."

Opium poppy (afuyō)　Poppy resin　Opium (ahen) 《Small text: Common｜name》

　To collect opium, one should first select white varieties. Those with red or purple flowers are called ornamental poppies (hana-keshi). These types produce little sap.
　When the capsules are still small and soft before the petals have fallen, during daytime one should use hands to remove the petals, then pierce the membrane area from the outer skin with a needle or small knife. The white, milk-like substance that flows and drips should be scraped off and collected with a bamboo blade. If the lower leaves are removed, more sap will flow. Imported varieties are wrapped in leaves. This is probably, as described in the medical text "Kokon Itō," made by pounding the capsules, extracting the juice, boiling it, and mixing it with powdered gallnuts. One should choose carefully.

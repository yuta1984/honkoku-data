Flax (ama)　gomarnin　Leijsaat《From Tamura・Dutch》

　Brought by foreign ships, its seeds are larger than sesame (common name), flat, brown-colored and glossy.


Another theory　nabena　Duivelsbeet《Dutch》
　　　Wild celery《From Kyūkō Honzō》

　It grows wild in mountains and fields. After surviving winter and reaching spring, it grows to a height of four to five shaku, with five leaves per branch, square stems growing in pairs, and many hairs and thorns. In summer it extends its stem, divides into several branches, and forms a ball-like cluster at the top with densely packed pale red flowers. It resembles mountain radish (datsuma chrysanthemum). Inside there are several seeds, shaped like imported flax (gomarnin). This roughly matches Shizhen's description that "its stem spikes somewhat resemble motherwort seeds but are not the same."

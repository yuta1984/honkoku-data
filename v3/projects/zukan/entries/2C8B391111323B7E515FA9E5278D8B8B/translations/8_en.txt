It grows in meadows and fields. It is abundant around Nerima in Musashi Province. Young
seedlings resemble pine shoots. As they grow somewhat
larger, they come to resemble kochia (summer cypress) or saltbush.
It extends branches and opens five-petaled pale purple flowers. It resembles
the Flas recorded in "Butsuinman" but has smaller flowers.

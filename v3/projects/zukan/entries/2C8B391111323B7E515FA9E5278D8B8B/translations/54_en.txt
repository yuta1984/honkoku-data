　It grows beside ditches or in fields. The perennial roots die back and leaves emerge early in spring. The shape is elongated like wheat maiden (yarinpō), with stems extending several sun or one to two shaku. The leaves are alternate. At the tips are branches with long spikes that stand upright. Many small, round and flattened seeds cluster and attach. They ripen in early summer, turn white, fall, and self-seed. Villagers collect the seeds to make paste. Butchers also collect the seeds to make rice and eat it. It counteracts poisoning from animal meat that causes fever. Hence the name "etsutamugi" and others. According to Zheng's commentary on the Erya, "it is童粱 (tōngryō)." It is a type of rice that yields only a few grains but falls easily, and grows again the following year. Therefore it is called "shuden" (guardian of the field).

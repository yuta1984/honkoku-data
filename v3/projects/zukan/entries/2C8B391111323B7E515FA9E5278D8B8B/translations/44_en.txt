【Description of wolf-tail grass】
　Common in fields and along roadsides. It grows in
　clusters from a single root, with leaves resembling
　barley leaves but longer. Its roots penetrate
　the ground so firmly that they cannot be pulled out,
　hence the name chikarashiba (strong grass).
　In autumn it produces ears. The shape resembles
　foxtail grass ears but longer and
　larger, with long purple hairs
　like a wolf's tail.
　At the base of each hair there is a single seed,
　round and elongated.

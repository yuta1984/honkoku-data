　There are no native Japanese varieties; originally they are cultivated from Chinese seeds that were transmitted. The leaf shape resembles that of Scrophularia (figwort family), with square stems and opposite leaves. In summer, flowers appear between the leaves. They are labiate in form and pale purple in color, later forming angular fruits. The old theory that two- or four-ridged varieties are white sesame (hakuyūma) and six- or eight-ridged varieties are black sesame (uma) is incorrect. The form is the same for both black and white varieties, but thin, small ones have two or four ridges, while large, plump ones have six or eight ridges. They should not be classified by the number of ridges. The leaves rarely change to form three points, resembling orchid grass (Eupatorium). This corresponds to what Shizhen described as "originally round but dividing into three branches at the end, like the shape of a duck's foot."

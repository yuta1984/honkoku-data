Wheat (shōbaku)　mamugi 《Wamyō-shō》　komugi 《same as above》

The type with awns is called centipede wheat (gokōbaku) 《Lanxi County Gazetteer》, and the type without awns is called fire-burned wheat (kashōbaku) 《Qingpu County Gazetteer》. That is, these are hulled barley varieties. Large and small wheats, glutinous and non-glutinous rice, glutinous and non-glutinous millet, large and small millet - all have extremely numerous varieties. Records such as comprehensive gazetteers, prefectural gazetteers, and county gazetteers list their names and forms in sections on land taxes or local products. There are also many in our country. However, both Japanese and Chinese sources use temporary appellations or local dialects specific to individual villages, making them confused and complex, not easily distinguished. This variety is not eaten as food, but is used only for making noodles (udon) and wheat gluten. In wheat fields, there are plants whose ears rot and produce black powder. The Wamyō-shō calls this "mugi no kuromi," and in Edo it is called "kuronbō." This is wheat ergot (smut disease). It occurs in both wheat and barley.

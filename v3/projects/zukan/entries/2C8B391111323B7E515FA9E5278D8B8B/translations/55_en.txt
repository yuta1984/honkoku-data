　It grows abundantly in sandy areas along the seashore. Those from Ōshū and also from Shichirigahama in Sōshū have large leaves. The leaves resemble sedge (kayatsurigusa) but are broader, thicker, and deep green in color. They also resemble kan-susuki but are shorter. In summer months, spikes emerge from among the leaves extending four to five sun. The shape is like a writing brush with yellow stamens. Later it forms seeds like small wheat. The roots have yellowish-brown fibrous roots that extend through the soil. There is also another variety that grows along riverbanks with narrower leaves that resemble the leaves of cyperus (kayatsurigusa), being thick, deep green, and glossy. The flowers and seeds are the same.

These flowers are what was referred to as "rarely crossed over" in the Kokin Wakashū anthology. Their flowers have
fragile petals, and their varied colors from China
being most fascinating, there is good reason why this name alone was
bestowed upon them. Therefore, in recent times
it has become popular to transplant them into various containers for
enjoyment. Since I have such a deep love for
these flowers, I find it very sad when
they wither quickly, so I had them painted in pictures
and even composed into poems because I became so
absorbed that I lost track of time.

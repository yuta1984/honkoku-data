　bloom late. For these, seeds should be sown at the Spring Equinox (Shunbun). Next,
　sow seeds at Clear and Bright (Seimei), and for variegated varieties that bloom very early but have
　difficulty extending their vines, sow at Grain Rain (Kokuu). If seeds are sown in soil with extremely strong
　fertilizer, the seeds will rot. Therefore, sow in ordinary soil
　and transplant to fertilized soil pots when the first true leaf emerges
　between the cotyledons. Seeds have a hilum, which should be placed upward,
　and the seed should be buried three bu (about 9mm) deep in soil. From Spring Equinox to Grain Rain, it is cold,
　so their nature is weak. If too much water is given after sowing seeds, they will

　rot. When the soil becomes very dry, water should be sprinkled before noon.
　After Grain Rain, as it approaches the season for sprouting and becomes warm,
　their nature becomes strongest. Even if too much water is given, sprouts will emerge in seven days.
　　　　〇 Fertilizer Application Method
　When sprouts emerge, leaves flourish, vines extend, and buds already appear,
　apply fertilizer at nodes, then apply fertilizer again after half a month, and on the tenth and twentieth
　days, gradually apply fertilizer as appropriate. For most
　varieties, it is better to apply liquid fertilizer rather than direct application. For extremely sunny locations

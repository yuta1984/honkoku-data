○ Iganasai says: "This blooms the earliest, flowering during the vernal equinox period in the second month. This is probably the Sōshi-kaidō (a type of flowering crabapple) recorded in crabapple catalogs. The flowers grow in clusters at the tips of branches. They resemble kochia or branch-and-leaf patterns. The flowers do not open fully and are single-petaled."

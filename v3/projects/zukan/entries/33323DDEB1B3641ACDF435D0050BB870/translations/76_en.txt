They emerge mixed between the petals. The flower shape appears wilted. In Ōshū Sendai, this is called "naden" cherry. In Kyoto, what they call "naden" refers to the dog cherry.

○ According to the "Kasshōō Sakura-fu" (Cherry Genealogy by Elder Kasshō): "It is the same as Shiogama cherry, but the difference is that two leaves emerge from within the flower." Flower (hana), nose (hana), leaf (ha), and tooth (ha) are homophonous. It means "elephant's nose protruding teeth," hence it is called Fugen-zō.

○ Don'ei says: "What the 'Geika-en' (Flower Cultivation Garden) describes is also large white with a thousand petals, bearing a pale color, with two thin leaves emerging from within the flower like an elephant's trunk. Some people say that because this flower has long stems that droop downward, it is called Fugen-zō."

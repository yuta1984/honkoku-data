Dog Cherry (Inu-zakura)
[Illustration]

○ Igen-sai says: "Both the wood and leaves resemble those of ordinary cherry trees, but small flowers cluster together forming spikes. The flowers are not worth viewing for ornamental purposes. It is also called 'naden' or 'uwamizo.' However, one must not mistake it for 'naden,' which is an abbreviation of Nanden cherry - they are different species. The fruits of this dog cherry ripen in the sixth month. Their color is yellow and the taste resembles apricot kernels. Enthusiasts preserve them in salt and use them as accompaniments for sake."

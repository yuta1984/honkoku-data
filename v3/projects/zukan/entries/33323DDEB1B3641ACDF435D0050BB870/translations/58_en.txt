There are bows wrapped with birch bark (kaba-maki). They are produced in Kai Province and Shinano Province (Iida). This bark is excellent for treating carbuncles and tumors. It is called kabahi-san (birch bark powder).

○Dōnei says: The flowers are single white. The bark of this tree is much used by woodworkers, or for wrapping flutes and such. In the Wamyōshō it states: "Birch (kaniba) - the Japanese name is kaba (加波) or also kaniba (加仁波). This exists in cherry bark now. It is the name of tree bark that can be used as torches." Kanba and kaniba are the same thing. "N" and "ni" are interchangeable. Like calling orchid (ran) "rani" and aster (shion) "shioni." "Kaba" is an abbreviation of "kaniba."

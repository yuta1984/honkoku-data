Chigo-zakura (Child Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Igansai says: It has thinner layering than Kumagai cherry. While Kumagai cherry opens with petals curving outward, Chigo-zakura blooms with petals embracing inward. It is a single-petaled, small-flowered white variety, with flowers growing sparsely. There is one tree on the east side below the Niō-mon gate at Ninna-ji temple in western Kyoto. The flowers are small and closely resemble plum blossoms. There is also a similar variety with single white petals of medium size called Tono-zakura (Lord Cherry).

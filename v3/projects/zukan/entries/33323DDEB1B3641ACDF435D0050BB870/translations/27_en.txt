There are also two varieties: Uba-higan and Yae-higan. Uba-higan blooms without leaves, and the color is pale. The flowers are particularly sparse. Yae-higan has double petals and has color. The single-petaled variety is called Higanzakura. There are three types in total.

Also, in the Sakura-fu (Cherry Catalog) by Kasshosho-ō, it states: "Blooms during the equinox in the second month. Has no leaves, flowers are small and do not open fully, single-petaled. The stem is slightly long and the flowers are not dense." Iganasai says: "This is precisely Uba-higan. Kasshosho-ō only described one variety."

Also, in Kaibara Tokushin's Flower Catalog, it states: "The original name of Higanzakura is Kozakura, commonly called Higanzakura," but this is also incorrect. Kozakura is a variety of mountain cherry. Chigozakura is the same tree as Higanzakura. "Ko" (小) and "chigo" (児) have the same pronunciation but are different species. However, when written as "小" it is Kozakura, and when written as "児" it is called Chigozakura.

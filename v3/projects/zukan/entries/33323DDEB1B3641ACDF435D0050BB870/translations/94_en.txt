Ah, how those words resemble my own situation! Yet in the end, it amounted to only this, and I was unable to make any improvements. The work on cherry varieties began with the theories of the two masters Razan and Ansai, and Nawa Dōen, followed by what was compiled thereafter. Knowing that I lacked ability, Master Dōnei gathered from the disordered materials and arranged them in order, corrected and embellished what was insufficient, and instructed me to attach illustrations to each to show them.

When asked to write about this matter, I said: "This represents how my moral failings have allowed my father's tilled field to become almost wasteland. This is a grave sin. However, if you sow seeds for me and allow the millet and grain to grow luxuriantly from seedling to ear, then my moral failings might yet be somewhat redeemed. Nevertheless, without you, our predecessor's achievements would have fallen to the ground." Upon hearing that it had been engraved and completed, I was so overjoyed that I could not sleep, and thus I write this to express my gratitude.

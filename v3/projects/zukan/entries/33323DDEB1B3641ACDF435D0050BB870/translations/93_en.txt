○In the Cherry Compendium by the Old Man of Kasho, the garden cherry appears, but it is grass-like in form. The flowers are small and thousand-petaled, resembling the Kumagai cherry. It also states that it is a type of cherry and that its flowers bloom in the same way as cherries. This is incorrect.

○Cherry Begonia (Sakura Kaidō)　In the Record of Begonias by Chinryū, it is called Chinese Begonia (To-kaidō).

The rest is omitted.

Postscript to Cherry Varieties
During the Shōtoku era, my late father compiled seventy-two varieties, and cherry varieties were among them. However, due to my inadequacy, I abandoned that learning and did not pursue it, and moreover, I became increasingly negligent day by day. That book was bundled and stored away, left in disorder and uncollected. An ancient saying goes: "The father tilled the field, but the son refused to sow the seeds." Previously when I read this, it fell on deaf ears, but now I feel ashamed and reflect upon it.

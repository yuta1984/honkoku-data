When he expressed his desire, the owner said he would exchange it for anything, so they agreed to exchange it for one precious cherry tree.
When the day came to send it, the tree owner felt reluctant to part with it and, remembering the story of Wang Zhaojun being sent to the barbarian lands, immediately gave it this name and sent it.

Nioi-zakura (Fragrant Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Igensei says: It has thousands of petals and is red in color, with an extremely strong fragrance.
The flowers are small and sparsely attached.
Those without this fragrance are hi-zakura (scarlet cherry).
They are very similar.

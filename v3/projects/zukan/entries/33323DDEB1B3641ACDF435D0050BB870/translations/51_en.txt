○Igan-sai says: This is the refined variety of Edo cherry. It has double petals and large blooms, flowering later than Edo cherry. The layering of petals is thick, and the stems are long. The variety of this flower with short stems is called "Dai-Edo" (Great Edo). Dai-Edo and Hōrin-ji are exactly the same variety.

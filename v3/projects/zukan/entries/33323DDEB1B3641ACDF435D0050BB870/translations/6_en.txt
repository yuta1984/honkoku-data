overflowing in silk-bound books. Different varieties emerge generation after generation, and rare flowers appear anew each year - one cannot know how many hundreds or thousands of varieties there are. What Jing Lian said about "loving cherry blossoms flourishes more in Japan than in Tang China" is indeed true. The magnificent spectacle of the three spring months is celebrated uniquely by this flower, while all others are merely trivial fragments of brocade and broken embroidery. What do they amount to?

However, the monk Kenkō was biased in appreciating only single-petaled mountain flowers, and conversely regarded double-petaled ones as strange and inferior. What an eccentric quirk of taste this was! Those who love mountains prize their height and grandeur; those who admire water love its depth and breadth. Should those who appreciate flowers alone be different? Flowers should be rich and beautiful - without richness and beauty, they are not worthy of being called flowers.

Kenkō's exclusive love for short-leaved, sparse-flowered varieties and his disdain for double-petaled, magnificent ones makes him like those who do not love abundant blossoms but indulge in green shade. All of this stems from a taste for reclusive, withered solitude that values the strange, rather than from a fair and magnanimous heart. Not only regarding flowers, but his preference for the odd and disdain for the common goes against human nature, considering it sublime and transcending the vulgar to attain something beyond the material world

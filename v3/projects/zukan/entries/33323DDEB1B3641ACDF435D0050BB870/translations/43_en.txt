Koma-tsunagi-zakura (Horse-tethering Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Igansai says: At the grounds of Shoren-in Palace in Kyoto, there is what is called Koma-tome-zakura (Horse-stopping Cherry). It has double petals.
○Tonnei says: What is described here is the Koma-tsunagi cherry. It has medium-sized flowers of pure white color, with broad and thick petals. The stem is thick, and when in bud it has a slight reddish tinge. Koma-tome (horse-stopping) and Koma-tsunagi (horse-tethering) have the same meaning - are they perhaps the same variety?

The flower colors include two types: red and white. Some have flowers that bloom sparsely, while others bloom densely.

Pink Cherry (Nadeshiko-zakura)
[Illustration]
○ Donnei says: "It resembles a large lantern, with long stamens. The layering is thick, and the calyx is pale pink. The stem is short, and the flower has notched edges like a pink (nadeshiko). Hence this name was given. It is most notably double-flowered."

Ko-zakura (Small Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Igan-sai says: This is a variety of mountain cherry.
The flowers have a light color and bloom
densely like the double Higan cherry.
There is something called ko-zakura-odoshi for armor.
It was named after modeling
the color of this flower.

Shiro-zakura (White Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Ton'ei says: It resembles mountain cherry but
the color is pure white. It has single petals
that are broad and round. Both stems and leaves
are blue-green. There is one called Hanashiki-yuki-yamazakura
(Flower-colored Snow Mountain Cherry).
This one is whiter than that.
This is probably what is called
Yoshino mountain cherry.

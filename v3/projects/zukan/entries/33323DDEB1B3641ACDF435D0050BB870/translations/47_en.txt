Usuzumi-zakura (Light Ink Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Ton'ei says: It resembles white cherry but
the flowers are small and single-petaled with thin
petals. The color is white, and both stem and leaves
are bluish like light ink.
Also, there is one tree
in the garden of Saiho-ji Temple in Idai
Village, Wake District, Iyo Province.
According to what I heard from people of that province,

the flowers are single-petaled and darker than light ink color, with large
petals that have pointed tips. This must be
a different variety with the same name.

"The double cherry blossoms of ancient Nara's capital
　　Today spread their fragrance in the nine-fold palace"
Everyone admired the aptness and wit of this poem, and the entire palace was stirred to excitement. Also during the same reign,
there stood a large double cherry tree in front of
Nanen-dō in the southern capital (Nara).
Since it was a famous flower renowned throughout the land, the court commanded the
head administrator of Kōfuku-ji temple to transplant it to the imperial garden.

When the time came to uproot the tree, the monks became angry,
saying "Even if we incur punishment, we will not let
this famous tree go elsewhere," and they resisted fiercely.
When the Empress Dowager heard of this matter,
she was moved by the refined sentiment of the monks and
granted them Yono-no-shō estate in Iga Province, and during cherry blossom season, appointed
guards to protect the tree.

Hokake-zakura (Sail-hoisting Cherry)
[Illustration]
○Igansai says: The color is white with a slight reddish tinge, medium-sized flowers with double petals. Inside there are two accessory petals that appear like hoisted sails. Hence it is so named, and is also called Hata-zakura (Flag Cherry).

○Tonnei says: According to the elders, this flower is called Hata-zakura because long ago, when Hachiman Taro Yoshiie was on his campaign to subjugate the northern provinces, he planted a banner in Kuji District of Hitachi Province, and from that spot a single cherry tree grew. Therefore it has been called Hata-zakura ever since. It is said that the tree still exists in that place today.

As for the matter of where to stand according to such things, one should stand according to one's personal preference and convenience. However, the area under the eaves is where nobles and hosts are positioned, so one must not stand there carelessly. Even so, depending on the circumstances, if it is at the behest of a noble, one should not decline. Generally, regarding standing positions, arrangements are sometimes made based on the level of kemari skill, with the most capable person of the time, senior practitioners, hosts, and others consulting together. The reason for this is that next to inexperienced players, skilled players are positioned, or beside elderly players, young people knowledgeable in proper forms are placed, with the understanding that this arrangement helps maintain the ball in play, and positions should be allocated accordingly. Moreover, at public banquets and such occasions, positioning may follow imperial decree, and as people advance to their preferred positions according to hierarchical order, those of lowest rank find empty spaces near the shogun or nobles, but must not stand there carelessly.

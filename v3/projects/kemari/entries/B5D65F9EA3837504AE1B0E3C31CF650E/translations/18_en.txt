After withdrawing, one bows toward the person to whom one intends to yield. The person receiving the yield advances and adjusts their sleeves (when the person performing the ceremonial opening kick is of lower rank and the receiving person is of higher rank, the right sleeve is placed below and the right sleeve above). When a reciprocal bow is made, the person performing the ceremonial opening kick also calls out when passing the ball, receives it while watching, then drops it - this is one theory. When this ball is kicked back to the person performing the ceremonial opening kick once more, the opening kick performer kicks it once more with their foot - this is called the "three-step ceremonial opening kick" according to one theory. There is also a theory that one person alone, only the ceremonial opening kick performer, continues to lift it two or three times consecutively, calling this the "two-step, three-step ceremonial opening kick." There is also what is called the "improper ceremonial opening kick." Without kneeling, without looking around in both directions, without withdrawing the left and right feet, while standing, one takes the ball with one hand, faces toward the person who should appreciate it, kicks it once and drops it. This protocol should exist depending on the host. During the Kenmu era, when a kemari gathering was held at the residence of Former Minister of the Interior Tokudaiji (then Middle Counselor), this protocol was performed according to the teachings of Former Major Counselor Tamesada of the Mikohidari house (then Middle Counselor). Also, the ceremonial opening kick when dropped is passed by kicking to the person next in order. It would be uncouth to omit this for hereditary senior retainers under the pretext of appreciation.

Or if there are any inconveniences, one should begin digging and start planting from a different corner. Also, regarding "hon-ki" (original trees), if there are naturally existing trees in the kemari playing area, whatever kind of trees they may be, one should not reject them, as written in the protocols. The famous kemari court with pear trees at a certain place in ancient times probably also grew naturally. For temporary installations, zelkova and grey starling trees are also used. When beginning to plant, one must not make them exactly one jō five shaku tall. Also, for sudden gatherings, bamboo installations are common practice. When they exceed one jō five shaku in height, the tops should be cut. The branches and leaves four to five shaku from the bottom should also be trimmed and cleared when planting. This is called "nige-ki" (escape tree), meant for adding one more tree. This may also be called "five-year kemari court." These escape trees are planted near water or in areas with thickets, in directions that would be unfavorable for the ball. There are also "six-year kemari courts." Six trees were planted at the Kameyama Imperial Palace as well. There are also "single-tree" arrangements. At the Imperial Palace of Emperor Go-Daigo, in the north-facing platform of Jinjū-den, a single pine was planted and kemari was regularly played. Planting four surrounding trees should not be done in just any private location. Public places, gardens of noble dignitaries, or courts of families who have hereditary expertise in this art would be acceptable. Also, temporary installations during official use are acceptable. However, when one should be cautious, small [installations are appropriate].

During the time when Emperor Go-Uda was called the New Retired Emperor, Lord Tominokoji at the base of the great willow hanging, with sleeves of incense-colored unlined hunting robes and fans with crimson hems, folded the ribs about twice and made them flutter behind him in succession - this was a most admirable appearance and an unparalleled behavior, as the late Great Counselor-Priest related in his stories.

One: Concerning the Matter of Attaching Balls to Poles
The branches should be willow, cherry, pine, cockscomb tree, etc., following spring and autumn with flowers and autumn leaves; New Year's pine and others would be most appropriate. Though only plum is sometimes used, making balls has never been done (with plum) from ancient times until now. However, in recent years, when a hereditary retainer of the Bureau of Ceremonies attached (a ball) to the Shogun's kemari, it was reasonable that difficulties arose afterward. On the first day of the eighth month, when bush clover flowers were blooming in profusion, one was attached to a branch and sent to someone's residence, and when it was called an example of refined elegance, there was a feeling of not accepting such a tsunami. Regarding the method of attachment, like attaching a pheasant to a falconer's annual leaves, this year a branch should be attached two shaku from the top of a five-shaku branch. A true branch should be hung on that branch and attached. One shaku and five sun below the ball, facing toward the ball's binding point, a small branch should be provided as a return, and the lowest branch - this branch should be removed.

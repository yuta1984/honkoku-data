For formal court ceremonies (sokutai), there should be proper consideration. Regarding the beauty of yanagi-zakura (willow-cherry) hunting robes, the techniques that change into various colors are also considered beautiful.

1. On Eboshi-gake (cap cords)
The current practice involves three schools of kemari (kickball). Among these, our house uses one school's method, which is also used for court caps. Both Naniwa and Asukai schools draw the cord from inside the eboshi and tie it under the chin, but our school uses purple braided cords with nose pieces attached over the eboshi. There should be oral instruction for this. Those of lower rank may twist their hair and tie it to the nose piece for use. Like musicians who carry instruments and use the strings of biwa or koto tied in a beautiful manner, similarly, those involved in court music should especially cultivate string instruments and use eboshi-gake and instrument strings. How proper this would be - when wind blows slightly and the eboshi becomes unstable, one should use it from the beginning; otherwise, the forehead piece should be used only after becoming accustomed to it. For court caps, use from the beginning, and the dimensions of eboshi-gake should be noted by learned officials.

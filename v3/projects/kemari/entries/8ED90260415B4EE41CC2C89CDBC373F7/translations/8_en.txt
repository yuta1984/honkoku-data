[The footwork] varies. Besides the foot that strikes the ball, one moves the left and right feet three times. Regarding this, most people begin stepping from the right foot, but when the left foot is stepped only once and the ball breaks off even slightly, something called "hakari-ashi" (measuring foot) is stepped, which looks unsightly. It is considered excellent to begin stepping from the left foot, stepping right foot once, left foot twice, then kick. Incompetent people cannot do this at all. Also, even when others are kicking, one should constantly work the feet, creating natural footwork so that even a ball that breaks off can be kicked immediately without difficulty. Novice beginners step their feet like the kanoko-tori (spotted deer catchers) of attendants. After stepping in this manner, one should perform the three-beat rhythm. Although Emperor Juntoku had mastered every art, his performance of the three-beat rhythm in kemari was particularly admirable. The reason is that he performed the rapid four-beat hayashi music of santai-kō [?], matching his foot stepping to the kakko drum rhythm and aligning the ball with the rhythm of the taiko drum, playing for many kicks. With no variation in the height of the imperial ball kicks and no variation in the speed of the imperial foot stepping, his ability to match the rhythm would have been truly extraordinary and unprecedented.

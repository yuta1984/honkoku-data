It is said that one extends with the right foot. Also, going ahead of a ball that has been kicked far away, falling into a sitting position, and kicking the ball into the playing area is an excellent foot technique, as stated by Lord Sōzen. This foot technique can only be performed with a single step, and others should fully master this understanding. There is also something called "continuous extension." Kicking against the lower branches of the hanging tree and extending the quickly falling ball, then hitting the same branch again and kicking two or three times is most precious. When Lord Masatsune kicked from the first branch to the fifth branch in five directions of the lower branches of the maple tree at Sanmai Monastery, extending repeatedly, Emperor Go-Toba was greatly impressed. The essence of this does not fall short of noble techniques. Also, when the lay priest Lord of Shōnen'in performed the extension foot technique, it is handed down that he kicked his court cap's cord against the pine at his waist, which was a magnificent sight. For the extended foot technique, one should be mindful of falling backward and kick while bending forward - this is repeatedly auspicious and precious. There is a theory that the previous two articles together with this foot technique are called the "three forms."

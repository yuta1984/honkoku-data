Article 1: Regarding Buddhist memorial services
These should be conducted modestly, only as a gesture of sincerity. Even when held at private residences, meals and other provisions should conform to the prescribed standards.

Additionally:
Regarding monetary offerings for the deceased, those who formally request memorial services and fathers-in-law/sons-in-law may act at their discretion, but for all others such offerings are unnecessary.

Article 1: Regarding subscription donations
Previously prohibited, and furthermore, all matters resembling subscription donations should not be handled at all.

As stated above, in accordance with the laws established by previous regulations, these are being reaffirmed at this time. Until further instructions are issued, these provisions must be strictly observed. In recent years, both high and low-ranking members of the household have faced financial hardship and difficulties, but since providing financial assistance is also difficult in these times, this matter should be well understood, and nothing beyond the established regulations should be undertaken. When assigned to Edo duty, one should follow the directives issued in Edo, observe them accordingly, and somehow continue to serve faithfully. The same should be directed to all subordinates, and this must never be treated carelessly. Henceforth, there will be inspections by the supervisors, so everyone should understand this intent and strictly comply.

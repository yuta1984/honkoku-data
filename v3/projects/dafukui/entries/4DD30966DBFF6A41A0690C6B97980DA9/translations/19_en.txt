July 6th　Shigeyuki's written seal

1. July 9th: The Edo residence keeper of Lord Matsudaira Kaga-no-kami was summoned by Goyōban Andō Tsushima-no-kami Nobutomo, and the following directive was issued through a written notice. This was circulated from Lord Kaga-no-kami's residence keeper:

"Taking a concubine as a wife should not be done carelessly, but if various circumstances lead to such matters, henceforth those with ten thousand koku or more must report to the monthly duty rōjū, and others must report to their respective supervisory heads. Without doing so, it would cause confusion with mourning periods for wives or adoptive mothers, etc., hence this notification."

The above should be communicated to all concerned parties. End.

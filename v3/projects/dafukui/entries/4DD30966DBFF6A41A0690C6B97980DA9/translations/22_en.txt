1. 11th day of 8th month: At the council chamber (hyōjōsho), regarding the matter of rice loans for retainers, the following directive was issued through a written notice by the monthly duty senior councilor Inaba Uneme to all monthly duty officials.

The domain's finances have been continuously strained in recent years with many expenditures, and especially this year-end will be extremely difficult. Therefore, rice loans are hereby ordered for all retainers from their stipends and allocated rice, from the lowest ranks up, as listed in the separate register, for a period of three years starting from this year-end. Since it has been reported that the retainers are also suffering financial hardship, various consultations were held to find some solution, but as no other financial expedients could be arranged and no alternative measures were available, this directive is hereby issued. Depending on the state of the domain's finances, gradual repayment will be permitted to whatever extent possible during the three-year period. Since all must endure these hardships and continue faithful service, everyone should understand this intention.

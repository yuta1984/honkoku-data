On the same day, regarding austerity measures for the domain retainers in Edo, at the council of elders' chamber, Honda Shuuri issued the following written directive to all departments:

　　　Memorandum
　One: Henceforth, regardless of the occasion, all presentation of gifts is completely prohibited
　　　There shall also be no bestowing of gifts
　One: Regarding everyone's clothing, rough garments shall be used exclusively. Even during guard duty, attendance, or messenger service, while domain silk and fine hachijō silk are not restricted, generally elaborate clothing and conspicuous dress are strictly prohibited
　　　The same applies to ladies-in-waiting

　One: During gatherings, only one soup and one dish plus pickles are allowed; anything beyond this is strictly prohibited. Even for outsiders, one soup and three dishes with pickles and anything beyond that is strictly forbidden. In the exceptional case of formal guests, the items and procedures for entertainment must be reported to the inspectors in advance
　One: Gift-giving is strictly prohibited. Except for father-son and sibling relationships, even light gifts are strictly prohibited. Exchanges among ladies-in-waiting are subject to the same prohibition and are strictly forbidden. This applies equally to both auspicious and inauspicious occasions. As there may be ambiguous matters regarding gift-giving, henceforth the inspectors shall examine such cases, so this point must be thoroughly understood

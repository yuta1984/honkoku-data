1. Associate guard captains and contact heads should, during castle town fires, except when on duty, proceed to their designated offices and await orders. During town fires when the castle is upwind, this is exceptional, but during other fires, they need not proceed to offices - everyone should prepare and remain ready, proceeding upon orders.

1. Unit commanders should, during castle town and town fires, except when on duty, bring their unit members to offices and await orders.
However, those proceeding outside the checkpoint gate should, during town fires when the castle is upwind, act exceptionally, but at other times need not proceed to the checkpoint gate - they should prepare and remain ready, proceeding upon orders.

1. During fires near individual residences, there is no need to proceed to offices - go to the fire source to suppress the fire, and when fire brigades arrive, return home and stand guard.

1. Visiting nearby relatives at fire sources is exceptional, but otherwise proceeding to fire sources is unnecessary. During fires, ascertain the fire source situation before proceeding.

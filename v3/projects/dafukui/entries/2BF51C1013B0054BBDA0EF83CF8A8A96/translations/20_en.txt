1. During the lord's residence in the domain, when fires occur in the castle town, the monthly duty magistrate should immediately report to the lord's quarters and withdraw after the fire is extinguished. If the duty senior retainers are present, withdrawal should occur after the senior retainers' departure.

However, colleagues of the monthly duty should all go to the fire source, and after the fire is extinguished, investigate the situation and ensure that official reports are prepared without error through the foot soldiers' magistrates. Taking the documents submitted by these foot soldiers' magistrates, one person designated among the colleagues should go to the duty senior retainer's residence to report. Of course, if senior retainers are stationed at the lord's quarters, they should report there.

Yaori's note: Until the middle of the Tenpō period, all colleagues would go to the duty senior retainer's residence, but normally one person goes.

Addition: For fires within the retainer households, memoranda should be received from the fire source and reported to the senior retainers. Documents were submitted during fires at the residences of Ōtani Ichiemon, Yano Densaemon, and Ninagawa Rinzaemon.

1. One person among the colleagues should bring the fire source report to the secretaries' office. Of course, oral reports need not be submitted.

This was established on January 24th, Tenpō 3 (Year of the Dragon), during the Ishiba area fire, when Chamberlain Mouke Denzaburō conveyed that henceforth during castle town fires, both retainer and townspeople fire reports should be submitted to the secretaries' office by magistrates as before. Although there was no recent precedent, it was arranged for colleagues who went to the scene to directly bring fire reports to the secretaries' office. Naturally, there may be delays depending on the extent of fire spread, so temporary consultations should be held.

1. According to records from Kyōhō 2 (Year of the Rooster), during fires, two attendant messengers attached to senior retainers should, when the lord is in residence, go to the palanquin rest area during the day and proceed anywhere as ordered when senior retainers depart. At night, they should go to the dismount rest area, wait for senior retainers, and proceed as ordered. However, in recent years when the lord is absent, they go to the duty senior retainer's residence.

[Red ink] On August 27th of the Rooster year, the lord inquired of Ogawa Yoemon where the attendant messengers should go during fires. When informed that the ten attendant messengers serve in three shifts with four-person and three-person rotations, and that those on duty report to the lord's quarters, the lord ordered that they should prepare fire-fighting attire before reporting, as they might be sent as messengers or to the fire source. It was reported that during the lord's absence, two attendant messengers each are assigned to the senior retainers. However, examining the duty box records, it appears they are also assigned during the lord's residence, though the attendant messengers believed they were not assigned during residence. On the 28th, after reporting yesterday's directive to the senior retainers and the matter of assigning attendant messengers to senior retainers during residence, the senior retainers had no clear recollection, so upon further inquiry, they were told to follow this written directive henceforth, and this decision along with the lord's intentions were conveyed to the attendant messengers.

1. Regarding the above castle town fires during the lord's residence, previously the monthly duty magistrate would report to the lord's quarters while others went to the fire source to extinguish fires, then all would report the fire situation to the duty senior retainers before all colleagues reported to the lord's quarters. However, during the Meiwa period, one magistrate was ordered to be stationed at the lord's quarters day and night, with one person each accompanying for area patrols. Therefore, since the magistrate on duty at the lord's quarters has attendants during fires, the monthly duty magistrate also reports to the lord's quarters. After senior retainers' departure, the monthly duty magistrate goes to the duty senior retainers, while other magistrates obtain fire suppression reports and all go to the duty senior retainers, then all report to the lord's quarters. Of course, if senior retainers are stationed at the lord's quarters, they report there.

1. When on duty at the lord's quarters, if the lord should venture out due to fire, attendants should accompany. For urgent nighttime needs, hand-carried lanterns are available in the magistrates' quarters.

1. During the lord's absence, when fires occur in the castle town, the monthly duty magistrate should immediately go to the duty senior retainer's residence. Attendant messengers, foot soldier magistrates, foot soldiers, etc., should all go. Depending on wind direction, if the duty senior retainer is stationed within the Dismount Gate, they should meet and be informed, as conveyed to the attendant messengers, with advance riders sent to the senior retainers. Magistrates may go as ordered. The senior retainers should be positioned in front of the rest area within the Dismount Gate. Magistrates should leave the administrative compound and position themselves at the gravel area. During this time, unit members may be sent to observe the fire situation, and when the fire generally subsides, there may be communications advising the senior retainers to withdraw.

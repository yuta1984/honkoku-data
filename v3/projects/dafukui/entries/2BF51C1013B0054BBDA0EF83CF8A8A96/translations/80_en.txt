1. Kyōhō 16, year of the boar (1731), 2nd month, 15th day: Hahakabe Hachizaemon reported that since Ashigaru-gashira Hasebe Koemon's residence had no stable, he had asked his partner on duty, Imamura Denkurō, to temporarily house his horse there. Although there are precedents for this, since it concerns an official horse, he reported it.

1. Same 17th year, year of the rat (1732), 3rd month, 16th day: Due to the position changes of Hayashi Matazaemon and Iwagami Kajidayū, Kajidayū was appointed as Omizunushi-gashira and given Matazaemon's residence, while Matazaemon was given Kajidayū's residence. Sugita Danshichi then reported that when Kajidayū had requested a residence change himself last year, he went to a residence without a stable and had not yet built one, so if there were regulations, both parties should negotiate regarding stables, which he had declined at that time. This matter was discussed with the senior councilors, and estate magistrate Sugita Danshichi was instructed to handle it accordingly with strict orders.
　　However, both men were given position changes at Edo in the 1st month of this year. Matazaemon was appointed to succeed Hori Bunzaemon as Osaki-mono-gashira.

　Then on the 1st day of the 6th month, due to the residence exchange between Hayashi Bunzaemon and Iwagami Kajidayū, while Kajidayū was supposed to build a stable for Matazaemon's residence which lacked one, Matazaemon's residence was damaged by fire on the 27th day of the 3rd month, so this was not carried out. This was conveyed from Okabe Sazen to Shimoyama Hanzaemon at Edo before Kajidayū's departure. Therefore, this matter was reported to the estate magistrate.

1. Same 19th year, year of the tiger (1734), 7th month, 21st day: Castle deputy Koma Ichiemon was granted the official residence within Geba Gate. The next day, the 22nd, Ichiemon reported that this official residence had no stable until now, asking whether it would be built by higher authority or if he should do it himself. When consulted with the senior councilors, it was noted that previously when it was granted to Honda Nuinodono after Shōan-in-sama's retirement, the stable was also built by the recipient himself according to precedent, so it would not be provided by higher authority. Genba conveyed that this should be communicated to him, and this was sent to Ichiemon by letter.

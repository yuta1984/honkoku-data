Or those reporting to guard posts should never report merely upon hearing rumors of fire. If the fire source is known or smoke can be seen, they should report immediately. There is no need to report carelessly.

1. Fire-fighting personnel also need not report if no smoke is visible. It depends entirely on the fire situation. If there is no wind and the fire source is uncertain, rushing to report would cause commotion in the castle town, so this should be understood.

Recently, the Great Guard Commander conveyed that during castle town fires, on-duty guard unit samurai should report to the lord's quarters, while off-duty personnel should gather at the office where the commander is stationed. Previously, they would report to the commander's residence, but since some locations were inconvenient, this was changed some time ago. Regarding this, during the recent Katsumi fire, when Tsuneoka Yasazaemon was at the Iron Gate and was ordered by the senior retainers to go to the fire source, he went to Katsumi. At that time, Yasazaemon inquired what should be done about the guard unit, and it was suggested that they should go wherever the commander goes. The guard units went to Katsumi afterward. When asked if this procedure should be followed again, it was agreed that taking guard units to fire sites would be unnecessary. However, since the regulations for samurai guard posts had no clear previous orders in the regulations, this was reported to the senior retainers, and today's directive was issued as stated in this text.

1. On March 27th, Kyōhō 3 (Year of the Dog), regarding off-duty guard unit samurai guard posts during fires, they should gather at the inner passage of Inaba Uneme's residence, in front of Sugita Heima's residence, and at the Iron Gate, and act according to orders. This was to be discussed with the guard commanders as conveyed by the senior retainers to Takada Kozaemon.

However [Red ink] Record of April 1st
Regarding stipend recipients among the castle guard units, since their stipends are small and they would not have many servants, they should remain at their lodgings to manage fire-related matters and need not report.

This was conveyed by the senior retainers to Castellan Amagata Gorozaemon, according to records.

[Red ink at bottom] This was when Gorozaemon inquired whether stipend recipients among the castle guard units should also report to these locations, and upon consulting with Uneme's office, this was the result.

1. On April 21st, Jōkyō 2 (Year of the Ox), a similar directive was issued.

This is An'ei 1st year

Estate Lending and Borrowing, Shared Residence, Long-house Rental, and Separate Residences

1. In Shōtoku 4, year of the horse (1714), Takahata Isaku was not residing in his estate but had established a borrowed residence elsewhere. Due to official business, it was decided to recall him. It is recorded that when the time comes for him to reside again, he should submit a petition, and permission would be granted at that time.

"On the 16th day of the 4th month when the petition was returned, it was noted in the council records that the senior retainers stated that making inspection visits and staying for periods of ten to twenty days each was exceptional."

1. In Kyōhō 10, year of the snake (1725), regarding Ishikawa Mosaku's matter: he petitioned to move during Kuniedanao Naoemon's absence in Edo in order to care for his ailing mother, but this was not approved. Since there might be others residing outside their assigned residences, he was instructed to speak with various unit commanders, and the following was communicated by letter:

"I have received your intention by letter. Regarding Ishikawa Mosaku's recent petition: since his mother is in poor health, he wished to move to Naoemon's residence during Kuniedanao Naoemon's absence in Edo to care for his mother. However, since leaving one's granted estate to reside elsewhere is difficult to approve, his petition was not accepted. Concerning this matter, while there are people who leave their granted estates vacant to reside with relatives, if there are cases of people not residing in their own estates, the unit commanders should be attentive and ensure that such individuals do not exist. I am instructed to discuss these points, so I am writing accordingly. Please also communicate this matter to your colleagues. Above.

4th month, 21st day

Additionally, sending wives and children away during Edo residence duty and leaving estates vacant continues to be acceptable as before. Above."

1. In the records of the 19th year, year of the tiger (1734), regarding fires and secondary fires, when samurai moved their households to relatives' homes, both parties should submit petitions. During the Tōkōji-chō fire in the 3rd month of Kyōhō 17, year of the rat (1732), consultation with the inspectors was sufficient, but that was during the lord's absence year. In the 11th month of Kyōhō 19, year of the tiger, during the fire at Asami Tokuemon's long-house, when those affected by secondary fires moved to their relatives' homes, since the lord was in the domain and the matter should reach his ears, Sakai Genba's office instructed that petitions should be submitted. This is recorded.

Yaori considers that this appears in the records of when the Asami family's long-house was destroyed by fire.

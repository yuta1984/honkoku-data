1. Previously exempted fire brigade members to serve as associates: Takada Kozaemon, Matsubara Tazen

Regarding this, Shōbei conveyed that they should serve in monthly duty order, and in the month following monthly duty, remaining duty should be coordinated. This is because during major fires, remaining duty members also respond, but otherwise if there are other fire incidents, there would be shortages. This was conveyed to the senior retainers.

1. On the same day, since Koma Ise was recovering from malaria, regarding main keep fire brigade duties, he wished to have his son Chōbei organize personnel and dispatch them. When this was conveyed to the senior retainers, it was approved.

1. On October 2nd of the same year, two advance unit heads were ordered to bring their unit members to the main keep during major castle town fires. A notice was submitted to the dismounting drum, naturally without delay day or night. This was ordered as deputy magistrate office assistance, with both men ordered to proceed to the main keep.

1. On March 7th of Kyōhō 20 (Year of the Rabbit), Matsubara Saburōbei conveyed that since he had been appointed to succeed senior guard captain Makino Tonomo, should he proceed to the same fire site station at Sannomaru archery range as before? When this was asked, since he was ordered to proceed to the same location as his predecessor, this was conveyed to the senior retainers, and he was instructed to proceed outside Tetsu Gate as his predecessor Tonomo had done.

1. On April 11th of the same year, since deputy magistrate office assistance had been appointed to one advance unit head, regarding proceeding to the main keep during castle town fires, should orders be given for only one person to proceed first when the designated official arrives? After consulting with the senior retainers, this was conveyed to monthly duty advance unit head Hayashi Matazaemon.

1. On August 15th of Genbun 1 (Year of the Dragon), since additional territories were granted and Honbo transfer was completed, the advance unit head was exempted from public stipend duties. Therefore, bringing personnel during main keep major fires was discontinued, leaving no one to proceed to the main keep. When this was conveyed to Nuinosuke, he responded that during major fires, senior retainers would be stationed, so they should understand that personnel from anywhere could be summoned, therefore advance unit heads need not be stationed at the main keep. They should understand this and remain ready.

1. On April 28th of Genbun 3 (Year of the Horse), since shrine fire brigade Ashida Zusho returned leave and departed for the capital, until his return, Sugita Danjō, Ariga Naiki, and Ogino Magoemon were appointed to shrine fire brigade.

[Red ink] On July 26th of Kanpō 2 (Year of the Dog), due to economy measures, designated personnel for fires among retainers were discontinued, so as before, there were instances of not carrying horse banners. Naturally, retainers were not reduced.

1. On September 15th of the same year, at the castle, the retainers conveyed that during fires, with only firefighting standards, when personnel withdraw, they intermingle and become confused, so hereafter they wished to carry horse banners - how should this be done? When this was conveyed to senior retainers and consulted before the lord, permission was given to carry them at will. Also, since the lord was not familiar with both firefighting standards and horse banners, illustrations should be submitted, and this was conveyed.

1. On April 14th of Genbun 5 (Year of the Monkey), at the residence of Matsudaira Shōbei, to town magistrate Tsuchiya Jūroemon:
Recently there have been frequent fire rumors causing disturbances, but fire sources are unknown. This may be because there are those who create disturbances. If there are miscreants, in this situation they might even commit arson, which is particularly worrying. Though it goes without saying, investigate thoroughly day and night, and if there are suspicious or unreliable persons, arrest and investigate them without restraint. Above.

To Kanazu three-district magistrate:
The same as above - in villages around the castle town, investigate rumors with the same care. Above.

Recently there have been false reports of fires, and though the fire brigade monthly duty didn't know beforehand, they rang bells and everyone responded, causing great disturbance. So fire brigade members were invited to Shōbei's residence. Everyone responding quickly is natural since it's a dry season requiring vigilance, but ringing bells and responding to unconfirmed incidents causes great disturbance in the castle town. This would actually make fire sources more worrying, so it's better to confirm truth before ringing bells and responding. Since Shōbei thought of this and discussed it, the fire brigade members conveyed this, so Shōbei told them to keep this in mind.

1. On January 25th of Kanpō 3 (Year of the Boar), Mōju Densaburō, still wearing front hair and not yet having submitted service applications, was appointed to Kōkenji fire brigade.

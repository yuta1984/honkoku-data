1. On July 11th of Enkyō 3 (Year of the Tiger), Town Magistrate Iwagami Kajitayū reported: "Even when fires occur near the castle town, I have not been able to enter the castle grounds until now. However, since the flying spark extinguishers proceed there, if I bring along my ladder men, I could also be of service, so may I enter within the gates like the flying spark extinguishers?" When this matter was discussed among colleagues and brought to His Lordship's attention, orders were given that Kajitayū should henceforth be able to pass without hindrance. Therefore, passes were submitted to both the Dismounting Gate and the Audience Chamber gates, and he would enter and exit thereafter.

1. On February 29th of the same 4th year (Year of the Rabbit), orders were given to Magistrate Iwagami Kajitayū that in case of fire near the Keya area, he should direct the river brigade among the town firefighters to prevent flying sparks, according to his own judgment.

1. On October 11th of Kan'en 1 (Year of the Dragon), after 5:30, a fire broke out in Oguri Hachibei's longhouse, so the firefighters proceeded there. Hachibei had gone to the Council Chamber on business for his colleagues, but when he hurried back, the entire longhouse had burned down. Since humidity was good and there was no wind, there was no spread to other buildings. However, since today was a council day with the senior councilors assembled at the Council Chamber, monthly duty officer Kumagai Kobei was stationed there. Nara Gonzaemon proceeded to the Audience Chamber, and Hatano Senuemon and Hasebe Koemon proceeded to the fire source. After the fire subsided, official business was conducted at the Council Chamber.

1. On March 23rd of Tempō 2 (Year of the Rabbit), Archery Captain Ichimura Kyūtarō reported that the following had been ordered and asked for acknowledgment:
"Regarding the hundred-man fire brigade appointed through special consideration in Meiwa 8 (Year of the Rabbit), since years have passed and negligence may occur, the captains have consulted and now issue the following orders:
1. During fires, twenty men should assemble their equipment and rush to the scene immediately
1. When equipment bearers change, ensure no disruption to their successors. If manpower is insufficient, investigate and impose punishment. However, for equipment bearers, employ capable and swift men to work at the scene
1. When captains change, the fire administrator will notify, so the ladder foreman and six ladder men should appear for recognition
1. When fire positions are secured, position certificates shall be issued thereafter. However, position certificates will not be issued for careless position-taking"

1. On July 8th of Hōei 7 (Year of the Tiger), since Honda Magotarō was summoned to Edo, he need not perform shrine guard duty until his return. Ashida Uemon likewise need not perform main castle fire watch duty, as ordered. However, since some of the high-ranking officials were summoned to Edo this time, overall fire brigade supervision fell to Sasaji Naoyoshi and Ariga Shōsuke, so it was agreed that one of either Koma Toneri or Honda Shirōemon would proceed to the shrine. Although Castle Deputy Sakai Yosōbei customarily proceeds to the main castle, this depends on the circumstances of any fire outbreak, as previously discussed. This was due to the ceremony for Lord Shōan'in [Matsudaira Yoshikuni]'s succession.

1. On October 24th of Kyōhō 2 (Year of the Rooster), Sugita Heima, though young, had come of age, and feeling it regrettable to remain idle without official duties, submitted a written request through intermediary Ariga Koemon to proceed anywhere during fires despite being unassigned. When this reached His Lordship's attention, orders were given that during castle town fires, he should proceed to and wait before the Equipment Storage Gate. This was conveyed to intermediary Koemon by Inaba Uneme at the Audience Chamber.
[Lower section] Note: Heima's original name was Gonnosuke. On August 7th of Shōtoku 4 (Year of the Horse), he succeeded his adoptive father Gorobei with 1,000 koku, but being 14 years old, was granted 200-man stipend and appointed in high-ranking status next after Ariga Koemon.

1. On August 26th of the same year, Matsudaira Shume was appointed to main castle fire watch duty, replacing Ashida Uemon who was appointed to senior councilor position.
Since Shume was elderly, orders were given that his son Shōbei should be sent during fires.

1. On July 13th of the same 19th year (Year of the Tiger), Ashida Shimono was appointed to shrine fire brigade duty. However, since Shimono had health issues, his son Zusho should be sent during fires.

1. On August 6th of the same year, Castle Deputy Koma Ichiuemon, being in mourning, inquired through Residence Keeper Tsuneoka Yasuzaemon whether he should avoid appearing for audiences during main castle fires. Regarding firefighting matters, even in Edo there are no restrictions during mourning, and given the urgency, during fires there is no need for restraint whether for audiences or otherwise, as conveyed by Okabe Sazen at the Audience Chamber.

1. On October 6th of Kan'en 1 (intercalary month, Year of the Dragon), since Ashida Zusho's group was appointed to senior councilor positions, shrine fire brigade duties were assigned to each of the following, who should take note: Sugita Danjō, Ariga Kyokujin, Habahakube Yukie.

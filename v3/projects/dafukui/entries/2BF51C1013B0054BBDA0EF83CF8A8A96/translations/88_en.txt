1. On the 5th day of the 6th month of Kan'en 1 (1748), domain inspector Kato Mataemon submitted a written petition stating that regarding the musket training ground for his group members, they had been borrowing and using the musket range of Tsutsuge Iemon's group for practice, but due to conflicts arising, they wished to petition for an archery ground. Since the number of group members had also increased, after investigation, they requested to be granted archery ground behind Kosoji Temple, which was communicated to Nara Gonzaemon. "The same was granted, and this should be understood accordingly. Since crops would likely be growing at this time, the archery ground would be allocated after the harvest was completed," as conveyed to magistrate Kato Takeemon. Since archery ground was granted to Kato Mataemon, the said archery ground corresponds to the diagram, and since this should also be communicated to the estate magistrate, it should be handled through consultation. Since crops would likely be growing at this time, it would be appropriate to allocate the land after the harvest is completed, as conveyed to inspector Tanabe Gotadayu.

Stone Walls

1. Kyōhō 17, Year of the Rat, 3rd month, 11th day: Regarding the construction of the Yamazato water retention stone wall that required inquiry to the shogunate, a drawing was completed. Since there was a precedent drawing from the stone wall repair inquiry of Kyōhō 4, Year of the Boar, it was decided to handle the matter in the same manner. Records exist continuously.

1. Genbun 3, Year of the Horse, 11th month, 17th day: Regarding the collapse of the water striking wall behind Shirono-bashi-chō, this was reported to the construction magistrate with a drawing. Although there had been no previous official notifications for this area, since inspections have become stricter in recent years, the senior councilors from the Sazen faction instructed that the inspectors should conduct examinations. Upon consultation, it was learned that the area behind Kamino-hashi-chō had previously been at the same level as the lower town, but when townspeople requested to build houses there, stone wall construction was naturally undertaken. While this matter might not require official permission, it was reported that it would depend on the inspection. Subsequently, it was conveyed to the construction magistrate that since no further official notification was needed, construction should proceed. Records exist.

Records of this communication exist.

1. Same year: Regarding the stone wall below the fence in front of the living quarters under the main keep of the hon-maru, the descending gate could not be properly opened, so it was desired to demolish the stone wall from its foundation and rebuild it. Although this was a stone wall below an inner enclosure fence, since it concerned stone wall construction, the construction magistrates reported that they could not order this on their own authority and wished to report to the senior councilors. Since this fence stone wall matter did not concern the castle's defensive fortifications but rather internal enclosure stonework, it was deemed acceptable to demolish and rebuild without formal inquiry to the senior councilors. Records of this consultation exist.

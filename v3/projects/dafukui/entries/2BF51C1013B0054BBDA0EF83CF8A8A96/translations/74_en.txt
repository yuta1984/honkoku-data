Storehouses and Storage Buildings

1. Tenmei 8, year of the monkey (1788), 8th month, 5th day: It was proclaimed from the finance officers down to all junior officials that there should be no improprieties due to extravagances inappropriate to one's station. Accordingly, for storehouses of junior calculators and below, since they are for fire prevention, small ones of about 9 shaku square are acceptable. Of course, henceforth one must strictly observe propriety according to one's station without misunderstanding. Should there be anyone who misunderstands, punishment will be decreed at that time. This proclamation is on record.

1. Kyōwa 1, year of the rooster (1801), 5th month, 11th day: Among the junior officials, there were those who had built storehouses with too many rooms due to misunderstanding, so orders were sent through the supervisory heads to reduce them. Naturally, this was reported to each after consulting with the senior councilors. At this time, there were inquiries from supervisory heads about matters such as dismissal and restraint, but it was explained that such measures were not necessary.

1. Kannen 3, year of the horse (1750), 8th month, 24th day: When Sengoku Tonnomo submitted plans for eaves on his residence, it was reported that the branches of the large zelkova tree at the earthwork were so overgrown that construction could not proceed unless they were cut, requesting permission for their removal.
For investigation, earthwork magistrate Nirazuka Riemon and one member of his group were dispatched, and finding no discrepancy, Riemon was ordered to contact Koma Taitō's office to arrange for the cutting.

1. Kansei 7, year of the rabbit (1795), 3rd month, 29th day: When Sakai Geki received the buildings of the lower residence in Jizō-machi from Honda Samon, since these buildings had been thatched until now, he wanted to change them to cedar shingle roofing, but due to current circumstances, he would build them as they were for the time being and later make them board-roofed. When Samon reported this for acknowledgment, it was communicated that since these were visible from the front and considering the nature of the location, board coverings should be applied until they could be properly board-roofed.

1. Hōreki 9, year of the rabbit (1759), intercalary 7th month, 16th day: Makino Tonnomo requested to temporarily thatch his long house. Since the location was visible from the dismounting area and should definitely be board-roofed considering the site's character, this was acknowledged as temporary, but it was communicated that it should be board-roofed by the time of the lord's arrival. This was because the long house had been destroyed by fire.

1. Kansei 9, year of the snake (1797), 5th month duty: Mōju Denzaburō reported to Nara Tarōemon that Isono Tamiya's residence quarters had suffered major damage, so he would rebuild them with the same floor area as before and requested acknowledgment. Since Watanabe Jūrōzaemon had not submitted a written statement in a similar case in previous years, no statement was submitted this time either. Upon investigation, it was found that when Matsudaira Kaito's residence suffered similar damage in the year of the rabbit two years prior, he had reported it with a written statement. There were numerous records of written statements being submitted when residences were completely rebuilt with the same floor area, but it was unclear whether the precedent of Kaito's written statement applied universally, and the matter varied by rank. After consultation among colleagues and inquiry to the senior councilors, it was determined that when not completely rebuilding a residence but only rebuilding specific sections like the inner quarters or front reception rooms with the same floor area, this was equivalent to repair work. [Between "in such cases" and "until now" should be inserted] Requests for increases or decreases in floor area must be clearly stated in writing. Even when maintaining the same measurements, reports should be made through written statements, and when there are increases or decreases in floor area, the previous procedures should be followed.

1. Requests to demolish corner buildings or reduce their size and use the old timber for main house repairs will not be approved in the future, as recorded in the residence registry of Kyōwa 3, year of the boar (1803), 8th month.

"Regarding Kuranosuke's Fukui residence, this was reported through the caretaker. Tenpō 4, year of the snake (1833), 7th month, 24th day"

1. Regarding construction work inside and outside residences: Senior councilors receive reports orally, and for complicated matters, written reports may be submitted. Additionally, as in the case of Sano Naizen's back gate construction on Bunsei 1, year of the rat (1818), 3rd month, 16th day, middle councilors may also handle matters orally.
For all ranks from high-ranking retainers downward, written statements should be addressed to inspectors. Around the Kōka era, for high-ranking retainer residences, written statements were on half-cut formal paper.

Previous precedents for corner building demolition typically included requests to use the old timber for eaves and such, but this time only requested demolition, which was slightly like reduction, so after deliberation and further inquiry, the request was approved as wished.

This was reported to the senior councilors and the request was approved.
However, storing a corner building is a difficult matter, but due to the circumstances, the request was approved, and Yoemon was told for future reference that it should be completed according to the original floor area.

1. On the 14th day of the 4th month, Yokota Sakutayū reported to monthly duty officer Tachiiwa Heiemon that Itō Sōji in Kyoto had died on the 10th day as his illness could not be cured. Kiyoda Bunkyō submitted official death notification documents and Sōji's service records, which I conveyed and brought today. Based on this, the notification documents and service records were conveyed to Koma Mokō, who received and kept them. Since this was reported, I told Sakutayū to ensure this matter was communicated to Bunkyō. [Red ink ends here]

1. Meiwa 9, 4th month, 10th day: Itō Sōji died of illness in Kyoto. On the 5th day of the 6th month of the same year, the following was decreed by Duty Officer Koma Daigaku, Inspector Monthly Duty Officer Katō Hanzaemon, with Tachiiwa Heiemon added:

Itō Bunshirō:
I have been appointed as adopted son as requested during Itō Sōji's illness, granted family succession with fifty-man stipend without change, assigned to the Great Guard unit, and told by the Senior Councilors that I should work diligently in family duties.

Itō Sōji's succession is as just announced. - Tachiiwa Heiemon
Regarding this, when adoption was requested during illness, the wish to be together with Sōji from the beginning was also granted as requested, and the Senior Councilors said this should be communicated to Sōji's entire family.

1. Hōreki 3, 10th month, last day: When Yamagata Riemon (now Ogino), archery instructor of the Great Guard unit, died of illness recently, his son Gunshirō was granted succession without change. At that time, the instructor position was announced by the Middle Elder at the next seat in the Council Chamber, and this was recorded in the Council Duty Records. Until now, such matters were announced by Middle Elders, so there had been no incidents in council duties, but recording it this time seemed questionable. When Inspector Hasebe Koemon inquired of Nagami Umon, Umon explained that since the Senior Councilors had said the instructor position should be announced immediately, it was announced at the next seat. Hereafter, when similar cases occur, they will be handled at the Council Chamber, which is why it was recorded in the duty records. There is a record that Umon gave this explanation.

1. Hōreki 4, intercalary 3rd month, 16th day: Dan'no Manemon, jūjutsu instructor of the Great Guard unit, was granted rest, and his son Gunbei was granted succession without change. At the next seat, he was appointed instructor like his father Manemon, as announced by the Middle Elder.
However, since Gunbei was separately serving as foot soldier, through Assistant Amagata Kazuma, he was granted succession without change with one hundred koku, as announced by the Senior Councilors. At that time, the foot soldier commander was at the next seat.

1. In the Shōtoku 5 records, there is an entry about consulting with Senior Councilors regarding the son of a firearms instructor who was granted succession but not yet appointed as instructor.
1. At the beginning of Kyōhō, Hasegawa Magoshichi had the same situation.

Enkyō 2, 10th month, 26th day: Since he died of illness while young, Hori Jūjirō was not granted succession. This was naturally decreed according to law.
However, since there are matters requiring examination, if there are suitable persons within the family to establish the family line, private examination should be conducted and name registry documents submitted, as told to Residence Keeper Minagawa Tazaemon. Inspector Tsuchiya Jingoemon was in attendance.

Same year, 12th month, 11th day: Granted ten-man stipend - Kanie Iwanosuke, age 13
Since Hori Jūjirō died while young, succession was not granted according to great law, but since he was a hereditary retainer, he was granted the above and appointed to maintain the family name, as announced to Iwanosuke through Minagawa Tazaemon.

Meiwa 3, 6th month, 17th day: Due to young age, granted stipend of one hundred men according to regulations, with high stipend - Mizutani Tsurutarō, age 8

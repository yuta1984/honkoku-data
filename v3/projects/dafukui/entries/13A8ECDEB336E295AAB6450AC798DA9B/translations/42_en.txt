1. Tenpō era
1. Regarding stipend increases from minor officials up to unified rank, and transfers in and out of financial officers, foot soldier inspectors, foot soldier group leaders, foot soldiers, etc.: these shall be handled after making inquiries. However, other transfers, confinements, etc., shall be ordered through deliberations in Edo, and serious punishments shall be handled after making inquiries.
1. Regarding financial officers and the aforementioned four positions: since there may be special considerations at the time, they should be handled after making inquiries.
1. Stipend increases for those below unified rank and all punishments shall be ordered after deliberations in Edo. However, punishments involving withdrawal of stipends shall be ordered after making inquiries.

1. Tenpō 13 (1844), 4th month, the following was decided:
1. Regarding stipend increases for minor officials and below, except for those related to official duties, it seems inquiries should be made, but under the article stating that various promotions do not require inquiries, it seems they may not be necessary. Therefore, after this deliberation, it was decided to handle matters without inquiries during the current extended stay in Edo.

1. Kōka 2 (1845), 8th month, after deliberation, the following was newly decided:
1. Regarding stipend increases from samurai and below, from minor officials to unified rank, and transfers of financial officers, foot soldier inspectors, foot soldier group leaders, foot soldiers, etc.: these shall be handled after making inquiries. Other transfers, confinements, etc., shall be handled without inquiries. However, serious punishments shall be handled after making inquiries.

In both cases, there were no spring and autumn promotions during the lord's absence, so spring and autumn promotions required inquiries. This was the case even for low-ranking samurai.

shall be handled
　The above, if proclaimed by the duty officer, would also interfere with morale and be inappropriate, so it shall be kept confidential by the magistrates and inspectors, and henceforth handled gradually
　according to the internal deliberation document. Furthermore, since this matter was also communicated to the magistrates, the document should also be sent to the magistrates
　and one copy submitted to the senior councilors as instructed, so it was handled accordingly. The document had been previously submitted for approval, and after internal
　deliberation with the magistrates, since the magistrates had no objections, the document was newly sent this time
1. Bunsei 13 (1830), 2nd month, 5th day, the following was communicated to all military commanders:
　　From Bunka 9 (1812), deputy officers who have been on active duty from various groups and residing in group houses shall gradually move to external residences
　　　However, those with unavoidable circumstances who cannot move immediately must move to external residences by the end of this year at the latest
1. Tenpō 2 (1831), 8th month, 20th day, the magistrate's inquiry was as follows:
　1. Regarding Akari warehouse deputies and financial office deputies: since they handle actual goods transactions, enormous promissory note circulation, and various complex accounting matters, being particularly important office positions, hereafter if deputies of these two offices serve for five years, they should be granted minor assembly grade positions, and after serving another three to five years, depending on their diligence at that time, through deliberation they should be granted regular minor assembly grade positions - how would this proclamation be? When proclaimed thus, everyone would serve longer with greater dedication, making the office operations particularly well-staffed
　1. Based on this lord's intention, Buddhist attendants and various deputies would be assigned to integrated service, and after examining each one's dedication, hereafter reassignments should be ordered based on aptitude for their service duties - how would this proclamation be? If this were implemented, everyone would find unsuitable reassignments troublesome, and naturally would pay proper attention to their appropriate duties

　On the 25th day of the 9th month, after deliberating on the above two articles, the following was proclaimed to magistrate Imadate Gorōdayū through official correspondence:
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Akari warehouse deputies
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Financial magistrate deputies
　　Hereafter, when those serving as deputies in these two offices reach five years of service, they shall be granted minor assembly grade positions, and furthermore, depending on years of diligent service, may be granted regular minor assembly grade positions
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Buddhist attendants
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Various deputies
　　Since there are aptitudes and inaptitudes in their service methods, hereafter they shall be appointed to integrated service and reassigned after examination
　　　End

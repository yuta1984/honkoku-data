However, when there is a leap month, if it is before the 15th day of the 13th division(?), it is granted from that month; if after the 16th day, it is granted from the following month.

1. When those who receive rice allowances (kirimai) die: If death occurs on or after the 1st day of the 11th month, that year's full rice allowance is granted; if up to the last day of the 10th month, it is granted on a monthly pro-rated basis.
　　However, when there is an heir, monthly pro-rating is not necessary. When rice allowances are reduced, that year's portion is distributed according to the reduced amount.

1. When those receiving rice allowances are granted new stipends (shinchi): Regardless of when this occurs, that year's rice allowance is deducted in full from the rice yield.
　　However, stipend allowances (fuchikata) and assistance silver (gōryokugin) are not deducted.

1. Stipend allowances are granted from the day they are decreed and stopped from the day they are ordered to cease.
　　However, for heirs who have been receiving their parent's stipend allowance, whenever they are appointed, the son's stipend allowance is granted continuously from the day after the parent's death.

1. When the heir to a new grant is given a rice allowance: regardless of when this occurs, that year's full rice allowance is granted. When converted to a stipend allowance, the portion from New Year's Day is granted.
　　However, when a parent dies in the 10th month and that year's rice yield has been granted, the heir son's stipend rice allowance is granted from the following year.

1. For role payments (yakuryō): In cases of role changes or death, they are granted on a monthly pro-rated basis. For that month's portion: if decreed before the 15th day, the successor receives it; if decreed after the 16th day, the predecessor receives it.

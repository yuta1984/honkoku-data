Regardless of rank position, representatives should be presented. However, when those of mi-no-bangai rank and above receive a direct official note from the duty officer, they should first acknowledge receipt, then immediately send a formal letter stating: "I am currently indisposed or in pain and confined, making attendance difficult. Please provide guidance on how to proceed." Instructions will then be given to present a family representative, so a relative should be sent.
Even when the person concerned has formal court dress duties, the representative should attend in hakama.
However, for guard units in such situations, after the unit commander consults with the duty officer, instructions regarding representatives will be given to the person concerned.

1. When official duties are assigned to a representative, courtesy visits and duties are performed by that representative on the day, so even if the original person later attends to duties, courtesy visits are no longer necessary.

1. In Bunka 9, year of the Monkey, the following was decided:
1. When the guard unit faces petitions or punishments, and both guard commanders have impediments, orders shall be communicated to the monthly duty officer.
1. When the same situation occurs with the garrison unit and both garrison commanders have impediments, orders should be communicated to the monthly senior guard commander.
However, since there was one precedent where punishment for someone in the garrison unit was communicated to the chief Suō Chōbei, after further investigation by the metsuke, it was decided to follow the aforementioned procedure henceforth.

1. On the 24th day of the 7th month of Bunka 9, year of the Monkey, when both Kanie Tahei and Kawamura Eisaburō were appointed as pages and had impediments requiring appointment of representatives, there was no additional allowance. However, after deliberation, the following was decided for the future:
When appointed as page or when transferred from page duties, additional allowances are generally granted. When representatives are appointed due to the principal's impediments, the presence or absence of such additional allowances was inconsistent, usually without additional allowances, but henceforth it was decided that representatives would also receive additional allowances.

1. On the 20th day of the 8th month of Bunka 13, year of the Rat, when attached page Kawasaki Saburosuke was punished at the council chamber, since the chamberlain was indisposed, the karō communicated orders to the monthly duty officer as representative.

1. On the 3rd day of the 6th month of Bunsei 13, year of the Tiger, regarding the residence exchange ordered for saki-mono-gashira Ishikawa Heihachi during his period of discretionary restraint, and the residence exchange ordered following Sakakibara Sukezaemon's death, etc., these appear in the residence exchange section.

1. On the 29th day of the 9th month of Kyōhō 17, year of the Rat, when Takesawa Daishichi of Sano Matatarō's guard unit was appointed as senior armorer, since Daishichi was ill and could not attend, orders were communicated to chief Nara Sakon'emon, and the karō instructed that this matter should be communicated to Daishichi.

1. On the 21st day of the 9th month of Shōtoku 2, year of the Dragon, since Inaba Tamon was indisposed today, monthly duty officer Sakai Tenzen attended alone. Usually for official public duties, one monthly duty metsuke attends that position, but when one karō handles official business and when town magistrates, magistrates, district magistrates, etc. attend to official duties, henceforth one metsuke each should attend at the council chamber. Tenzen informed the metsuke of this matter today and served accordingly. Regarding the matter of one karō attending the council chamber, this spring everyone consulted together, Tenzen reported to his lordship, and it was decided as above. Official duties section record.

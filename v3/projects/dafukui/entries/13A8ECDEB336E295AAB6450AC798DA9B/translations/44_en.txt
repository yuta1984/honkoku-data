Regarding Retirement (inkyo) and Rest (kyūsoku) Appointments and Returning to Service

1. For retirement matters, both father and son are summoned, and the Senior Councilors make the appointment. Even for fief holders (chigyōtori), one inspector (metsuke) is assigned, and retirement ceremonies are performed in the lord's presence.
However, when there are role changes on the same day and appointments of Mi-no-bangai rank or higher within the guard units occur, the unit commander presents himself before the lord for the ceremony, after which those appointed to retirement present themselves for the ceremony, with the Senior Councilors facilitating.

1. Those of Mi-no-bangai rank or higher appointed to retirement are designated as "rest" within the guard units, but examples of those appointed to retirement while in guard units are as follows:

《Hōei 6, 11th month, 26th day, Great Guard Unit》
1. Matsue Zenbei: This Zenbei Chūemon served faithfully from the time of Lord Ryūhōin, but due to advanced age is appointed to retirement, so he should rest comfortably. Until now, no one from the guard units has been appointed to retirement, but this person's house succession is held in special regard, so this appointment is made as stated above, and this intent should be conveyed.

However, while retirement appointments for guard unit members are unprecedented, due to special circumstances this appointment is made as above, with his stipend of 150 koku granted without change to his son Ichizaemon, and the rice allowance previously granted to be given to his second son Wasuke.

《Same day, same unit》
1. Ishikawa Chūemon: Similarly appointed, with his stipend of 125 koku granted without change to his son Hachizaemon.
1. Nara Chūzaemon: Served up to Kanazu magistrate but due to misconduct was placed in the Great Guard unit, and due to old age is appointed to retirement.

1. For rest appointments, only the son is summoned and appointed.

1. It was announced during the Bunka era that retired persons may wear formal dress with hakama, and may also wear hemp kamishimo for New Year ceremonies and similar occasions without problem.
However, there are no announcements regarding the clothing of those on rest status.

1. In Bunka 5, intercalary 6th month, when Senior Spear Commander Ōtani Ichiemon and Construction Magistrate Takeda Tarōemon were appointed to retirement, the Senior Councilors announced that while previously retired persons' clothing was limited to juttoku haori and similar garments, henceforth wearing hakama kamishimo like active retainers would be at their discretion, and this was conveyed variously. However, those on rest status must submit requests.

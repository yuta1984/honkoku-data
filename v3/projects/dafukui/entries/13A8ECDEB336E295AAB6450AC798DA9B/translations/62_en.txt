Matters Regarding Official Duties in the Domain and Other Provinces

One: For those listed in the established Edo escort duty roster, there is no need for special announcement. For others to be taken along, up to those of squad leader and military commander rank, announcements are made by the senior councilors, while for squad members, announcements are made by the ceremonial attendants.

One: Regarding envoys to Edo, Kyoto, and other provinces. For the Kōchi group, announcements are made by the senior councilors. For others, including assembly members and assembly squad leaders, announcements are generally made by the ceremonial attendants.
　　However, this depends on the nature of the official duty.

One: When inspection officials visit, those assigned to entertainment duties, fire watch during overnight stays in the castle town, and guard duty at Matsumoto entrance - all these are performed by advance military commanders. Announcements are made by the senior councilors at the accounting office.

One: For religious sect inspections in rural areas, two advance military commanders serve separately for upper and lower districts. Two messenger guards do likewise. These announcements are made by the senior councilors at the council chamber.

One: In Hōreki 2, Year of the Rooster, when bow commander Sugita Gotayū fell ill in Edo and was returned to the domain, Tsuge Iemon was appointed in his place as the next in rotation for Edo-stationed advance military commanders. On the 12th day of the 5th month, this was announced to chief retainer Ashida Zusho's deputy Namikawa Ichikurō, who then conveyed it to Iemon.
　　However, previously advance military commanders stationed in Edo received announcements from senior councilors, and personal military commanders stationed in Edo received announcements from chief retainers. But in this case, since it was urgent and he was being sent as a replacement for a bow commander, the announcement was made by the chief retainer following the procedure for bow commanders, as Ichikurō explained.

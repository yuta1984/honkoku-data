Kajidayū was informed, and Yamagata Gunshirō's squad leader Makino Orinosuke was also to be informed of the above matter, so this was reported.

1. The procedure for receiving written appointments is shown in the diagram below:
【Below the diagram】
　1. When the magistrate delivers the written appointment
　　It is opened and viewed at that seat
　　This is the ancient custom for receiving it

　　The ancient custom is as follows
【In the diagram】
□ Waiting room

Monthly duty officer
● Inspector
△ At this place, when first paying respects, the senior councilors
　announce that written appointments are being granted, then the magistrate
　delivers the written appointment, immediately stands with sword at side,
　receives his own appointment in the waiting room, returns to this place and sits
　pays respects and withdraws【End of diagram content】

1. When senior councilors grant written appointments to samurai at their residences, the inspector
　is told to appear at the monthly duty officer's place. If more than ten people
　are to receive appointments, one colleague should be consulted in addition to the monthly officer.
　If ten or fewer, the monthly officer alone handles it. Also,
　since we cannot know who will receive these written appointments, we should inquire with the personal secretary of the senior councilors.

1. On December 18th of Kōka 3, year of the horse, written appointments were to be granted at the residence of duty officer Sasaji Daigaku on the 19th, but Iida
　Tokujirō was in mourning. Previously, those in mourning were not granted appointments through representatives but only after mourning ended, as reported through the inner secretary

　Nomura Shirōzaemon. However, in recent years even those in mourning have representatives summoned to receive appointments, so it should follow recent precedent, as advised by Sakai
　Geki's office and others.

1. On December 25th of Tenmei 3, year of the rabbit, when receiving written appointments, Moro Kisaburō was omitted, so magistrates Asami Shichijūrō and Ishihara Jūgorō
　were held responsible.

1. On the 6th day of the intercalary 3rd month of Kyōhō 20, year of the rabbit, several people received written appointments at Honda Shuri's residence. Among them were three pages: Kawachi Hamon, Misawa Sagenta, and Ōtani Genji. These were under page supervisor Sasaji Jūzō's charge, and after everyone
　withdrew, guidance was sent, Jūzō was summoned to appear, and after receiving the written appointments, Jūzō conveyed thanks to Shuri's office.

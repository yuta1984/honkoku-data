1. Regarding the seating arrangement of those who receive financial assistance silver (gōryoku-gin) from the lord's personal retinue, since they should serve as dependents living in the family compound (heya-zumi), regardless of years of service, their father's designated seating should remain as it has been until now.

　　Above, 12th month

1. Regarding various notifications concerning those under punishment, this appears in the "Section on Various Punishment Matters."

1. The following regulations concerning the years required from appointment as junior guards (shinban-nami) and promotion, to subsequent appointment to senior guard (ōban) positions in order of precedence:
　1. On the 26th day of the 9th month of Enkyō 5, year of the dragon (i.e., Kan'en 1), at the hour of the monkey (4 PM), court liaisons Sasaji Gen'uemon and Shimada Seizaemon instructed attendance at the warehouse office. When monthly duty officer Nara Genzaemon attended, he was given the following document and told it was provided due to arrangements for new guard units in Edo:
　　　Memorandum
　1. Minor officials and foot soldiers (ashigaru) who serve ten years from their promotion to junior guard status are admitted to the new guard unit.
　1. Those admitted to the new guard unit who serve forty years are admitted to the senior guard unit (total of fifty years).
　　However, this applies not only to second-generation descendants and the original appointees, but according to years of service. Naturally, those in official positions or with exceptional service records may receive special consideration based on examination at that time, without regard to years. The same applies to those initially appointed directly to the new guard unit.
　1. Those who serve twenty-five years from promotion to senior guard unit achieve appropriate status.

1. On the 4th day of the 11th month of Genbun 1, year of the dragon, when Kawai Toyoshi and Miyatsuka Tomon were summoned as pages (koshō), their promotion seats were exempted and Okabe Sazen made the announcement to the page supervisors. In the future, when appointed as pages, upon inquiry about exempting their promotion status, it was announced that they should be exempted.

1. Those who serve twenty-five years from appropriate status achieve precedential seating; the same applies to those initially admitted to senior guards (total of fifty years).
　However, this applies not only to second and third generation descendants but according to years of service. Naturally, those appointed to precedential seating through official positions continue as before, or even original appointees with special circumstances and exceptional service are not limited by these years but subject to examination and decision at that time. [The following may be written in red] However, even when years are fulfilled, decisions should be made based on examination of that person's service record at that time.
　These matters should be examined and communicated during future guard duty assignments.

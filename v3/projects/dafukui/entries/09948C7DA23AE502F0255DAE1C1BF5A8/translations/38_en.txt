- December 16th: The official court physician Nagashima Dōsen arrived in Fukui (lodging at Hassaka-ya inn on Shimogofukumachi street).
  Immediately, a messenger was dispatched to escort him to the lord's residence. At that time, the karō and sōshaban came out to greet him at the entrance platform of the main gate. The high-ranking retainers gathered in the Gun Room, antechamber, and hearth room, while the yoriai, village headmen, town magistrates, commissioners, and inspectors waited in the front hearth room. Dōsen was led to the lord's private quarters where he examined the pulse and administered medicine.
  Note: From today, Dōsen will visit the lord's residence daily for pulse diagnosis.

- Same day: As thanks for the aforementioned matter, messenger and yoriai Takada Asaemon (Kazuuji) was dispatched to Edo, departing from Fukui today.
  Note: Asaemon's arrival date in Edo is unknown; a reply letter was delivered on the 22nd of the first month.

- Same month, 22nd: After taking a full course of Nagashima Dōsen's medicine, there was appropriate improvement and the lord felt somewhat better. This progress was reported, and a verbal message was conveyed expressing the desire to request that Dōsen stay a while longer. Koshō-gashira Okuda Heizaemon was dispatched to Edo to communicate this to Nakatsukasakarite (Masatatsu)-sama and other family members, as well as to Tsuchiya Sagami-no-kami (Masanao)-dono and Hikosaka Iki-no-kami (Shigetsuna)-dono.

- Same month, 29th: For year-end congratulations, kosode robes were presented through a messenger as customary, and silver was offered.

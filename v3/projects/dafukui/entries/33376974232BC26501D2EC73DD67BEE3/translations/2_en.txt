　　　　　After Lord Masachika's Retirement

Enpō 4, Year of the Fire Dragon (1676)
　One　8th Month, 26th Day　He ascended to the castle and expressed gratitude for his retirement, presenting a ceremonial sword (from Nakagawa district, worth 5,000 kan), horse substitute money (gold), ten sets of seasonal clothing (including three unlined robes and two lined robes), and a hanging scroll (calligraphy by Buchi), completing the献上 [presentation].
　　After withdrawing, he was summoned again to come forward, and due to repeated imperial commands to approach closer to His Lordship's presence,
　　he approached closer to His Lordship's side. Having heard that he had made strong entreaties,
　　and furthermore being informed that he was ill, retirement was granted as requested. Echizen-no-kami is still young

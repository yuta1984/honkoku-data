Things that will leave no trace for future generations

This work aims to preserve various matters and things from ancient times onward—whether based on past imperial intentions or gradually changing due to the circumstances of the times—that would otherwise be forgotten by future generations, by either drawing them in pictures or writing them down in text, so that they may be transmitted to the distant future. My hope is that from now on, people will inherit this sincere intention and continue writing without negligence.

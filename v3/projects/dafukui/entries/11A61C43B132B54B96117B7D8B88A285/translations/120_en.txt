Regarding this matter, there were occasionally those who traveled to Kyoto to request instruction, but our domain's literature teacher, Master Takano Tokusato, devoted his spare time from scholarly pursuits to music with great passion, went to Kyoto, entered the house of court musicians, studied the profound secrets thoroughly, and left behind many written records. Master Kobayashi Shōhō also received this transmission and became highly skilled, and now all the refined music circles in the city are people who seek his instruction.

The koto, se (zither), and biwa (lute) were the performing arts of entertainers since ancient times, but out of compassion for the blind, they were called hōshi (monk-musicians), zatō (blind guild leaders), and goze (blind female musicians), and those who excelled in their arts were granted titles such as kengyō and kōtō. In our Fukui as well, until around the time before the Tenna era, there were those who received such titles, and they made their living by reciting and singing the Tale of the Heike and imayō songs. Even afterward, there were occasionally refined people who learned these traditional styles, but in recent times, the biwa appears to have completely fallen into decline.

However, recently what is called Ming-Qing music (Chinese music) has become popular, in which people play ensemble music by playing and striking instruments such as the moon lute (gekkin), ming flute, wooden xylophone, and drums.

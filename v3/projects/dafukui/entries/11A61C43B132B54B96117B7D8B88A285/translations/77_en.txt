Having business to attend to on a dark night with light rain falling, he fearfully passed through while singing noh chants, when unexpectedly his umbrella was grabbed and pulled. Unable to do anything about it, his hair standing on end with terror, he fled for his life. The next morning, when he went to look at that place, he saw it was caught on a tree branch extending from inside the fence of the Izumi residence. Ashamed of the previous night's ridiculous incident, there was someone who kept it secret and did not speak of it to others.

There was also someone whose lantern flame was extinguished, leaving only a candle to light the way ahead. In general, various strange incidents frequently occurred at the residences in this area.

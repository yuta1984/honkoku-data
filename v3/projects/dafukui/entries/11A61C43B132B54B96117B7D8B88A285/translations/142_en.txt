I contemplated the impermanence of life in the smoke. Funabashi (boat bridge) remained only in name, and after crossing Morita, at Furuichi I recalled various old events, feeling melancholy and looking downward. But when I looked up, I could see Mount Hakusan, and the continuing peaks were white with snow. The mountains visible in all directions, far and near, were beautiful with autumn foliage, the chrysanthemums at farmhouses were at their peak, and the scattered autumn grasses after the typhoon were like brocade of flowers. This year was also a bountiful harvest, with rice harvesters working vigorously. The scenery in all directions dispelled my melancholy. Even the roads of this enlightened era had milestone markers rebuilt at the crossroads separating new from old, and the prosperity of Maruoka's commercial district, so changed from the past, goes without saying. Here I worshipped from afar at the venerable Shinmei Shrine on the right. Even more gratefully, since His Majesty's imperial progress, the roads that I had thought of as "ox valley" for walking had become wide, and passing vehicles could travel safely. Through such peaceful imperial benevolence, the distance seemed shorter, so I quickly passed through Daishoji, rested briefly at "Sui slope," moistened my throat with the sweetness of candy (a local specialty quite different from the place's name), and perhaps a little before four o'clock, crossing fields and rivers, I was guided to Yamashiro's Yoshidaya, a hot spring inn.

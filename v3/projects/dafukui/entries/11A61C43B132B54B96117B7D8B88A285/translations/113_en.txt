If the guest has been promised from beforehand
Let your heart be true and your work be light

When handling with the right hand, keep your mind
In the palm of the left hand

Even while performing one tea procedure, know the distinction
Between good and bad - this is the mind of presence and absence

Whether you pour the tea procedure quickly, or perhaps
Slowly, know the taste of it

"Namaru" means in the Way, sometimes fast and sometimes slow
Having unevenness in various places

When making tea with a small jar, whether you scoop
Or draw, don't say "scoop" - say "insert and draw out"

When decorating with a tray landscape, know that
Landscape paintings and such are inappropriate matches

On a board alcove, tea jars, tea caddies, and winter items
Should not be displayed, as handed down tradition tells

When placing flowers in a basket flower container on the alcove
Thin boards and such should not be laid down

When approaching to view ikebana arrangements
View them from three shaku distance on this side

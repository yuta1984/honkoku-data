would not know about this, so I draw illustrations to leave for future generations.

Regarding Conch Shells (Horagai)

From New Year's Day to the 14th day, groups of yamabushi (mountain ascetics) would go from house to house blowing conch shells, calling it prayers for household prosperity and flourishing. People would give rice or money as they saw fit. However, this practice ceased around the time when ascetic practitioners (shugenja) were abolished according to the policy of clearly separating Shinto and Buddhism. Also, from around the time of military drill reforms, battle conches fell into disuse, and those who blow conch shells have now become rare, so I leave this written record.

Originally, conch shells dwell in caves of deep mountains, and through the passage of long ages, they emit moisture and manifest their true form. When they become sacred implements, their function is protective prayer and meditation; when they become military instruments, they blow different sounds for jo-ha-kyū-shū (sequence-break-rapid-gathering), commanding the advance and retreat of troop formations and drills, and as one of the three primary instruments of military camps, they were treasured with crimson tassels and silver mouthpieces, kept in brocade bags and paulownia boxes, given beautiful names and held as secret treasures. There are no shells of particular merit anymore, and it has come to pass that there is no more conch shell blowing, but such are the times...

I experienced no reproach, encountered no family discord or misfortune, was not afflicted by disasters of water, fire, theft, illness, earthquakes, or storms, knew nothing of lawsuits or judicial disputes, escaped even what might have warranted punishment, received the spiritual benefits of divine and Buddhist auspicious signs, and attained the true happiness befitting one of seventy years.

Not hated but praised, blessed in this rare year
Whatever may come of this future　

Though I composed such playful verse, having devoted myself to arduous service over many long years and gradually reaching advanced age, even when I wished to avoid worldly gossip and retire completely, my house was cramped, and being too old in body to climb to the second floor, I leaned on my desk in various corners and conceived the idea of pondering the historical events of Fukui. To return to an earlier point, during the abolition of domains, preserving and presenting numerous records became a great achievement, earning commendations from both lord princes, who bestowed upon me official documents with various seals and a ceremonial haori jacket with the ancient hollyhock crest. The great fortune of fulfilling my wish to compile this collection of historical reflections comes from one who governs the sixty-four provinces.

Though I am not like the monkey retainer, having no further desires beyond this, I know not how to live a life free from worry.

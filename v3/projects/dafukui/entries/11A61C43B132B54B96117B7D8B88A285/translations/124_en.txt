Using various pretexts for frequent performances and even dedicating women's hand-dancing to shrine festivals as entertainment that might please the divine will, with arrangements involving lanterns, wind scarves, and banners displaying patron lists, various dyed silk cords and decorative hangings - not that I think these are bad, but when I imagine that this might represent the decline of Noh and reflect on old ways, I feel regretful and dejected.

Unexpectedly, it seems that enthusiasts who preserve this tradition gather for meetings, and there are occasional performances starting with various Shinmei shrine festivals, which appears to be truly delightful. I hope that this will continue without neglect for eternity, and that the tradition will increasingly flourish and prosper through successive generations.

　　　On the Shakuhachi
Among flutes, there are the shō, hichiriki, yokobue, hitoyogiri, and many other varieties, but while others may not know, I believe there is no more interesting sound or musical expression than the shakuhachi. This belongs to what is called the Fuke sect, with Fudai-ji temple in Hamamatsu, Enshū province serving as the head temple, and main temples in Nara in Yamato province, Meguro in Musashi province, and others, placing supervisory officials in various locations throughout the provinces (in our locality, this was Naitō Saū from the former Tatami-chō). Various aspirants enter their schools, receive permission and certification, and travel throughout the provinces. Others remain in their home occupations and residences, going around the city and near and far villages playing and soliciting donations of rice and money.

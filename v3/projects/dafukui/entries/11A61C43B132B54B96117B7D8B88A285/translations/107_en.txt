With a brazier, even if one does not watch the charcoal being tended
Not watching is all the more reason to know that one is observing
When becoming a guest and looking inside the brazier
Take care that the charcoal does not crumble
When hanging calligraphy, the table covering should
Generally be pulled toward the preparation area
Taking up that crumbled white charcoal
One should not place it again
When hanging paintings, I hear that the table covering should
Be pulled toward the side with the seal
Those who uniformly say that in summer preparation one must always add water to the kettle
Are mistaken
Just because it is summer, to close the lid when the water won't boil properly
What a mistake that would be
When bringing out a hand bucket for the water jar, with the lid
Take the front lid first and stack it
For the well bucket, if you take the lid with hands held vertically
Take the scooping side and stack it to the side
When preparing tea with a small board, the tea cloth
Should be placed at the edge of the small board

Regarding the Seventh Day of the Seventh Month, Tanabata

1. The star festival of Tanabata is something generally known by everyone, so there is no need to elaborate. Before the reform of the lunar calendar, in early July each terakoya (temple school) teacher would give out poetry samples, and students would make fair copies on five-colored paper and tanzaku (poem cards), tying them to bamboo branches from around the fifth day. The disciples from samurai families would do this each in their own way, while the various terakoya in the town quarters would all bring theirs together to one place, lining them up against fences. Then on the actual day, in the afternoon, each student would carry the bamboo branch they had prepared, with all the pupils forming proper lines, a large banner raised at the very front, and the teacher and senior disciples following behind as they went to the nearest river - though they all went to Shakudani - to float them downstream, making a pleasure of bringing lunch boxes along.

Regarding the Tea Ceremony

1. When one investigates the Way of Tea through its path, there are various ceremonial procedures and oral traditions that make it quite an enjoyable practice. However, although it was not originally intended as a display of arrogance, during the time of the Kamakura shogunate, aesthetic obsession (mono-suki) flourished excessively, and people became prideful even regarding utensils that are still treasured and kept secret as period pieces today. Tea scoops even came to be made of pure gold, but afterwards this was completely transformed through Sen no Rikyū's innovations. Tea scoops came to be made by selecting bamboo and carving them oneself, while tea bowls, incense containers, and other ceramics came to be produced as hand-formed raku ware.

I am also happily writing this down hastily.
I wrote this on the sixth day, but here again, Master Matsunaga and Teacher Okuda kindly urged me to come and talk, saying they had been staying in Araya for two or three days before me. So I would visit back and forth occasionally, and we would listen to and tell stories—this travel journal, my previous kyōka poems, amusing and curious tales mixed with worldly gossip—thus dispelling the suffering of illness and also writing and composing during boring intervals. When I showed them the draft of my "Onko-chō" (Collection of Warm Antiquities) that I had hastily brought over:

　A rare person with long whiskers and long life
　Is a jeweled treasure, the Fukui Gyokuhen (Terashima)

　Not Urashima Tarō, but Terashima of Fukui
　Creates even a treasure box with his collected writings
　　　　　　　　　　　　　Unu-an

They honored me with such verses, for which I was grateful and humbled, and responded:

　You lift up this old man who has no use in today's Setsuyō dictionary
　To call me "Gyokuhen" is truly humbling　Grandfather
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Jii (dictionary)

What suits the body: head covering, neck warmer, walking stick, eyeglasses
　　　Walking, warming stone, chamber pot, back scratcher
　　　Becoming verbose, short-tempered, complaining
　　　The heart grows twisted, the body grows old
　　　Wanting to hear gossip, seeming near death yet living long, feeling lonely
　　　Wanting to meddle, wanting to fuss over others
　　　Again and again, the same stories praising grandchildren
　　　Boasting about one's health while others find it tiresome

　These are satirical verses written with illustrations in Edo around the Bunsei era. Though I speak not as one in the position of a senior councilor, as depicted in the above verses,
all things decline with age. However, not all elderly people become
senile and stubborn. The past was the past, the present is the present - each person
should have seen and heard interesting tales and traditions
through the various professions they have pursued since youth. I would like to inquire intimately regardless of
social status, high or low, wise or foolish, investigate thoroughly, remove
superfluous words, and compile without omission even a single matter
worth recording for posterity.

One old tale tells of a wealthy house in a village where something was hung in a paper bag
　in the kitchen, when a large rat jumped down from the beams above
　and fell with a thud, then jumped again and fell with a bang, repeatedly

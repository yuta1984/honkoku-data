After parting ways and walking about one chō (approximately 109 meters), one of the servants was called back, and he was granted all the clothing of the moment - the long and short swords, hakama, and all the ceremonial attire. His excellent character despite his young age was praised, and he was further employed as chief attendant. From then on, using his spare time from daily duties, he diligently studied literature, martial arts, arithmetic, and calligraphy without interruption through heat, cold, day, and night. He served ever more faithfully, accomplishing tasks both internal and external without any ulterior motives, becoming increasingly intimate with his master. However, feeling that the time had come to speak up, he told of the pact he had made with three friends from his home province when departing his homeland. His master was both surprised and moved, and began treating him like family. Through family connections, he was earnestly sought after by a hatamoto (direct retainer of the shogun) with a stipend of 400 koku of rice. His master became his adoptive father and took him as an adopted son. Before long, he inherited the family headship, and through his long-standing loyalty and ability, he devoted himself to service. He rose through the ranks and eventually became an important official, daily traveling in a palanquin past the Echizen family residence at Tokiwabashi, attending the castle with an entourage of foot soldiers, equipment bearers, and other attendants. This too is a story from the same period as the previous account.

Our former domain has since ancient times encouraged the training of martial arts, issuing certificates in archery and horsemanship, spear and sword techniques, jujutsu, gunnery, and military science. Moreover, among these, there were not a few who received formal recognition (inka) from elder masters, and there was no one who failed to reach mastery in their respective disciplines. However, because of this emphasis on martial arts, the way of learning and scholarship was not given much importance, and there were even some who were illiterate and unable to write, leading to humorous anecdotes that persist to this day.

However, since Lord Yoshinaga succeeded to his position, he has devoted great effort to both literary and martial arts. From active retainers to children and dependents, he conducts daily reviews through written reports, grants appropriate rewards to those who show diligence, and provides extraordinary support and advancement.

My knowledge is limited and I do not know the reason for this. If there are learned individuals, please enlighten me.

One: For refined and fresh things that we enjoy eating,
     we say "tofu" (bean curd).
     For things that are fermented and used,
     we write "natto" (fermented beans).
     Also,
     Things that are lit and placed inside each household, never moved,
     are called "andon" (standing lamp).
     Though some may be hung, those used for nighttime travel
     are called "chochin" (paper lantern).
     This is also puzzling.

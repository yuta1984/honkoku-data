Anezaki Tosuke

Each was equally famous and skilled, instructing numerous disciples, and the practice flourished even more greatly. However, from around the Kaei and Ansei eras (1848-1860), the rikka (formal standing arrangement) style of ikebana gradually became popular, and even the flower vessels of the old schools became obsolete. While I do not cling to the old ways, I now intend to write about these matters following the principle of "learning from the past to understand the new."

Indeed, ikebana is not merely for individual amusement, comfort, or personal enjoyment, but is an essential art for decorating tokonoma alcoves for guests, ornamental objects, tables, and incense burners—

arrangements that cannot be omitted as they are necessary skills. Therefore, as a meaningful elegant pursuit, one should not neglect to cultivate this art, and I hope that in the years to come, ikebana will enliven the banquet seats of the Onko-kai (Cherishing Antiquity Society) by incorporating both traditional and formal styles.

The quality has declined to below that of ordinary silk, so it is meaningless to call it the famous hōsho silk. At present, when various regions are each devising improvements and making efforts, with such poor standards, even if there is no further decline, steady prosperity year after year seems quite unlikely.

The above concerns only hōsho silk, but all other products are similarly affected.

However, as mentioned earlier, this is the consideration of an ignorant old man who does not know the trade, so I lack the capability to research and debate these matters. In any case, we must make products with double the refinement, strive to eliminate dishonest and cunning practices, and work even harder to reform and make efforts so that national interests do not suffer even slightly.

Regarding this intention, I plan to record annually the conditions of local products and finance, and indeed all circumstances year by year, and furthermore to continue writing without negligence until the eternal future, so that people of later generations may know the conditions of our times. I will entrust this to the respective companies, and once completed, I will consolidate everything with those in charge of the Onko Society, with the intention of displaying all the many types of continuous records for public viewing.

Regarding that matter, although I approached various people with expectations and requests, it was to no avail, and as things gradually
fell behind schedule, the situation became rather unseemly, and I now witness items ending up in the hands of antique
dealers. However, since there are no sympathetic
connoisseurs to support this cause, I cannot acquire them with my private funds, and I deeply regret that
I may die without achieving my long-cherished aspiration of several years.
Now that things have come to this, it has become difficult to collect actual items.
I hope at least to thoroughly investigate, without omission, what treasures and artifacts
were kept in secret by the traditional noble families from the highest to the lowest ranks,
and to record this permanently in the records of the Onko Society.

The Utsunomiya family possesses various treasures. I would like to investigate and record these.

　Regarding the period when Kyushu shall be pacified, it is commanded that
　you should particularly attend to this matter. A document commanding that this should be reformed has been
　issued from above, therefore
　this message is delivered as stated.

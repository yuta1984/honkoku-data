They would freely display their theatrical gestures, singing joruri ballads and celebrating the auspicious occasion to the fullest. Furthermore, all warrior families, whether of high or low stipend, would celebrate coming-of-age ceremonies according to their rice stipend amount, each making their announcements and hosting banquets with sake and delicacies. Farmers and merchants would also use the coming-of-age celebration as an occasion for "joining the young men's group," hosting banquets appropriate to their social status, celebrating to the fullest and forming bonds of friendship.

In urban merchant houses, apprentices who showed promise would often be given coming-of-age ceremonies and granted eboshi caps, with childhood names like Chōkichi and Takichi being changed to names like Chōsuke and Tasuke, and they would be promoted to clerk positions - this was the old custom.

However, with the imperial restoration and the successive reforms of official and ceremonial dress, when all government officials serving in court duties were ordered to cut their hair, initially there were some who voiced stubborn opposition, but gradually they submitted to the imperial will. Regardless of class status, all commoners without exception cut their hair. Around that time, roughly speaking, short hair was five-tenths, shaved heads and monk tonsures were five-tenths, and among these, those who still wore their hair in the old traditional style appeared to be not even one in a thousand 《marginal note: November, Meiji 18 (1885)》. Even among those, there were none under sixty years of age.

Therefore, no matter how long-lived these elderly people might be, they would gradually pass away, and it was lamentable that soon there would be no one left who remembered the old ways.

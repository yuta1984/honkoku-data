Regarding the May Festival

1. May is called Tango no Sekku (Boys' Festival), and in ancient times it was celebrated on the first horse day of the first ten days of the month, but at some point it became fixed on the fifth day. Since this is a celebration for boys, families of high-ranking retainers and noble lineages with legitimate sons fifteen years old or younger would display large banners with family crests and tubular banners, as well as decorative helmets, spears, halberds arranged and displayed on frames. Those of lower status would each display as they wished - not only samurai families but also townspeople would set up carp streamers and tubular banners according to their means. However, apart from large banners erected to show support for Shinto shrine festivals, Buddhist lecture groups, sumo wrestling, theater performances, and other public entertainments, banners with family crests were no longer to be seen.

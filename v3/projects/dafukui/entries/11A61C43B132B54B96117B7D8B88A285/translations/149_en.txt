Again, to the sound of the falling winter shower, throughout the especially long night, unable to sleep, I took out my brush and tried to write down my unbearable feelings. With thoughts that needed expressing under the light of the pre-dawn moon, I stoked the brazier fire and spent the night without sleep. But from around daybreak the sky cleared, and with the weather gradually improving to fine conditions, thinking that today they would surely come, I went to the entrance and stood and sat alternately. Though I waited, they didn't appear past twilight—it must have been around seven o'clock. Just as I was thinking of writing a postal inquiry about their safety, when the innkeeper said the carriage had come, without even time to take up my writing brush from its case, I flew out in such joy that, not knowing hell but in this world, I felt as if I had met my parents. The driver arranged his preparations, finished his meal and drink and went to bed. We passed time in bedside conversation, and after a good night's sleep, at the cock's crow announcing dawn, I rose early and bathed. As this was the final moment, I felt reluctant to part, bathing twice and eating my meal. Adding to the lodging fee and tip, I composed a kyōka celebrating continued prosperity, though I omit writing the preface here. The renowned Yoshidaya inn here is good as a lodging, good for anything, good in sincerity, therefore comfortable and pleasant.

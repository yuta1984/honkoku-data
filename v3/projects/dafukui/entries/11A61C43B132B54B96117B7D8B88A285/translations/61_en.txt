The actual results achieved truly conform to the intent of the Meiji Restoration. From the Boshin War until the present, in addition to the separate list of those appointed to positions of sangi (senior counselor) rank and above who serve the imperial court, there are also a considerable number of government officials, various teachers, and many people famous in society in their respective fields. This is entirely due to the beneficial effects of His Lordship's profound consideration from long ago.

Regarding education for the general populace, the Ministry of Education has issued benevolent decrees, establishing schools even in remote mountain villages throughout the land and providing care, with the intent that there should be no illiterate people among the subjects of the Imperial nation. Therefore, for anyone to complain about educational fees and taxes would be a misunderstanding and inexcusable.

A Tale of Illiteracy

At some time in the past, a well-bred but illiterate samurai was passing through Daimyo-machi when a courier-like person wearing straw sandals prostrated himself with a letter in hand and politely inquired, "Where is this letter addressed to? Please be so kind as to read it for me." The samurai took it with a serious expression, held it up to the light as if examining it, and asked, "Did you ask others before coming here?" The courier immediately replied, "Yes, I had people look at it here and there." The samurai then said, "If so many people have already tried to read it, how could I possibly read it?" and threw it back.

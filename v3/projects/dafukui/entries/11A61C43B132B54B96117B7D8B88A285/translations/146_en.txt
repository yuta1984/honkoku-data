I had been worrying morning and evening about whether there might be someone who would inherit the project of continuing the Onko-chō (Collection of Warm Antiquities). Then the auspiciously named Master Matsunaga, who would repeat his "ten returns" again and again, had great aspirations to continue this work for thousands and myriads of generations to come. I was relieved and happy in his encouraging presence, trusting that I could surely rely on him to carry it on:

"Double the lifespan of an eighteen-year-old lord, the auspicious sixty-six,
I am at peace in the presence of this fortunate gentleman"

My stay has already passed a week, but since I cannot walk or exercise due to nursing my ailing leg, as I contemplate while soaking in the hot spring bath—though they say times are hard, this is indeed the famous Yamashiro hot spring. There are many people from Kanazawa, blessed guests from Fukui, and others from Komatsu and Daishōji—samurai, farmers, various merchants, monks and laypeople, men and women bustling about, some leaving, others arriving. The public bathhouses are filled with people from neighboring villages, and each inn has its own private baths. All compete with beautiful construction, with people setting up households in rooms appropriate to their status. In the hot spring baths where they soak after eating, strangers who have never met ask each other, "Where are you from?" and "What about you?" engaging in various conversations. "When the place changes, the songs change too"—they put their hands to their cheeks and grimace, singing itako-bushi or jinku, straining themselves while beating their bellies like drums, chanting utai.

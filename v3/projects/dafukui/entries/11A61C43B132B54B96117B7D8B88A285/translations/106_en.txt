For wide-mouthed tea containers, taking tea is called "scooping with a ladle"
For narrow mouths, it is called "scooping up"
When wiping thread tea bowls, wipe upward from the bottom
Do not repeatedly put your hand inside
When bringing out a moistened tea cloth, I hear one should
Leave it slightly frozen and then wash it
To receive and drink from where one has already drunk and rinsed
Is heard to be improper handling
Being concerned only with the custom of placing charcoal
Charcoal that does not boil water well is dead charcoal
When placing charcoal, even if it goes against custom
Charcoal that boils water well is true charcoal
In the custom of adding charcoal as a guest, always
Pottery and such things may get chipped
In the custom of taking charcoal as a guest, always
Do not hide the corners of the hearth with your feet
When changing charcoal, do not pinch the trivet, keep it cross-shaped
Do not break the rim, know the proper balance
If there is crumbled white charcoal, discard it
And place fresh charcoal for the evening

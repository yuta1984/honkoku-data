They would climb up and play the shakuhachi, calling to each other and conversing intimately.

Also, while this is not about the shakuhachi, I write a note about a kind story regarding a disciple of the family profession.

One time, when encountering a diligent student along the way, despite the clear and fine weather, perhaps worried about rain clouds in the southwest, the student carried an umbrella and wore geta, apologized for the rudeness, bowed once, and was about to pass by when [the master] called him back and praised his thoughtfulness, saying, "The secret teachings of my school are completely mastered in that very attitude. It is reassuring - you should study and practice with double the effort."

　　　The Order and Reversal of On'yomi and Kun'yomi Readings
　　　Though the names seem questionable, these have been used since ancient times

One　Heaven-Earth　　Up-Down　　Good-Evil
　　ame-tsuchi　　　kami-shimo　　yoshi-ashi
　The above類 should all follow the proper order of on'yomi and kun'yomi readings, yet
　　Yin-Yang
　　kage-hinata
　Like this, both on'yomi and kun'yomi are reversed, but have been read this way since ancient times
　　East-West　　　South-North　　　Front-Back
　　nishi-higashi　kita-minami　　ura-omote
　Also, like the above, there are readings where on'yomi and kun'yomi are switched
　What ancient circumstances could account for such cases? This is still [unclear]

Regarding Launching Fireworks
One: While signal fires and smoke signals were originally used as signals for military camps and garrison posts, in accordance with the peaceful reign, various elaborate devices have been developed. At the homes of military strategists and instructors of gunnery and archery, around the eighth month each year at Katsumi riverbank, Hashizu riverbank, and the upper and lower riverbeds of Funahashi, military strategists and gunnery instructors test launching signals, while archery masters test smoke signals, fire arrows, hill fires, water displays, etc. As these events sometimes receive imperial viewing, high-ranking retainers set up positions in various places, each hanging curtains bearing their family crests, while all other spectators freely choose their viewing spots

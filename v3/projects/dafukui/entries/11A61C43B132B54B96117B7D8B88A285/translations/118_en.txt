They set up their positions, bringing various lunch preparations in split bamboo baskets, tiered boxes, barrels, and gourds, making the wide riverbank so crowded there was no room to stand a needle, and the embankments they looked out from were all filled with crowds making merry and celebrating with drink.

The weight of these launching shells was typically five kan-me, but in the eighth month of Bunsei 6 (1823), when Utsunomiya Katsutaro launched fireworks at Itagaki riverbank and they were viewed from Koma Moku's lower residence, he used large shells of twenty kan-me. After completing two daytime launches, the third one - a yellow smoke willow - turned out exceptionally magnificent, and while the voices of tens of thousands of spectators shouting their unanimous admiration had not yet died down, unexpectedly a fire broke out from the ridge of a thatched house in Itagaki village, burning down several houses. Therefore, that day's event was stopped and postponed, and later viewing took place at Funahashi Shiōten.

Since this fire incident, the events were no longer held at Itagaki riverbank. Regarding fireworks, this Utsunomiya was a disciple of the artillery veteran Matsuyama Sentadayu, and perhaps with official approval, he requested instruction in Edo and gained mastery in various shelf-mounted devices and other elaborate contraptions, with occasional viewings held. This tradition remains to this day and is held annually at memorial festivals and other locations.

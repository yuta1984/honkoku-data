Good hospitality and good cuisine, many hot spring baths making it convenient, good fortune bringing good luck, therefore ever-improving prosperity—everyone praises Yoshidaya as "yoshitaya" (good shop), celebrating its increasing prosperity.

All the guests from here and there find Yoshidaya prosperous in Yamashiro of Ashihiki.

When I wrote and gave this to them, the couple's joy knew no bounds, and they asked for continued patronage. The sending carriage disappeared from view, and I quickly arrived at Daishoji. After resting briefly and departing, due to the recent long rainy weather the roads were poor and time-consuming. As it was already lunch time, I arrived at Ushinotani station, filled my belly and departed. At Nakagawa, which is between stations, I rested briefly and made a quick stop with a guide at Maruoka. With the sun already setting behind the western mountains, I arrived at a tea shop in Morita. Though I thought there would surely be no one to meet me, I bought some small souvenirs. This travel record I have been writing continues at length—having written it roughly, I conclude my brush at Aramachi, roughly but auspiciously, as my lodging place.

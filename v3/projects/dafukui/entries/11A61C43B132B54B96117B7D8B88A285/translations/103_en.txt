Since tea ceremony was also flourishing during the era of the former shogunate,
I intend to compile and present this material in the section on ancient matters
under the title of the "Onko-chō" (Chronicle of Cherishing the Past) that I have received.
I hope that although there are differences among the respective schools of Senke, Enshū, and Yabunouchi,
they will occasionally hold gatherings without negligence, and like the examples of classical poetry,
haiku, calligraphy and painting, bring items of historical significance
to the tea席, display them on stands, cylinders, furo braziers, shelves, square tables,
round tables, incense stands, and small tables for people to view,
so that the tea ceremony may flourish for a long time.
　　However
　　In regular practice, alcohol and food should be prohibited, and even when occasionally serving
　　cuisine at gatherings, if it becomes extravagant, it will not continue permanently.
　　The menu arrangements should primarily be simple, and needless to say for entertainment
　　feasts, even hiki-zakana and tori-zakana side dishes need not be present.
　One　Furthermore, if there are changes in the names of tea master families
　　in the future, they should be recorded in succession.

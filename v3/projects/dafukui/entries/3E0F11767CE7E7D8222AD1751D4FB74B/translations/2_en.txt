Hōei 7, Year of the Metal Tiger (1710)
Item: Fifth day of the seventh month
When Lord Yoshikuni (Shima-no-kami Naotaka) attended the castle, at the veranda of the O-hakushoin (White Study Hall), it was announced through the duty official Honda Hōki-no-kami Masanaga that Lord Yoshishina's request for retirement and succession had been approved without modification. After this matter was concluded, Lord Shima-no-kami came to this mansion.
The above matter was reported, and thereafter, as a proxy for receiving acknowledgment, he made rounds to the rōjū (senior councilors), and as a proxy for retirement gratitude, Shinano-no-kami Naoyuki visited the rōjū and the goyō-gakari (personal attendant) Manabe Echizen-no-kami Akifusa.

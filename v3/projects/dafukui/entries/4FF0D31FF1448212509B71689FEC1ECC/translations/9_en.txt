One: On the 26th day of the 4th month, regarding the matter of carrying the long sword, although he had been refraining from doing so until now, as he was gradually being restored to former precedents, he wished to carry it. This matter was previously communicated to Senior Councillor Tsuchiya Sagami-no-kami Masanao through Ōoka Jiemon Tadanao, and today at the same place, the following written notice was given to Jiemon:

　　Regarding the matter of Matsudaira Hyōbu-dayu's wish to carry a long sword
　　Having consulted with Mino-no-kami and others, since he has carried one before, this is not a new request. Moreover, in recent years he has been progressively granted distinguished appointments, so it is reasonable for him to carry a long sword at his discretion.
　One: As for Ōi-dono, having consulted with peers who are heir apparent residents, it is reasonable to proceed as such.

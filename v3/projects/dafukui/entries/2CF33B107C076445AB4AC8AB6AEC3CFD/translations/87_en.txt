Those who observed were Senior Councilor Honda Kuranosuke's group, Castle Deputy Nagami Tonomo, and Caretaker Amagata Magohachi. All of these attended and were granted audience, with his lordship's intention that they should view the hawks and horses bestowed this past summer. They entered the small sitting room.

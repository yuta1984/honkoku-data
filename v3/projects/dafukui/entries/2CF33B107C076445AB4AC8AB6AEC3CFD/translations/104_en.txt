Year of the Rabbit - Addenda
1. On the 15th day of the 2nd month, all monthly duty officers were summoned to the administrative office, and a written notice was distributed by duty officer Ogino Sakon as follows:
　The spring before last, beginning with the reconstruction following the fire at the Reiganjima mansion, various expenses increased substantially, leading to financial difficulties. From that same year, half-reduced rice loans were ordered for all retainers, and everyone has maintained frugality most admirably. However, despite various considerations and the appointment of officials to implement reform policies with sincere dedication, expenses at both the domain headquarters and Edo continue to exceed those of ancient times considerably. With debts and unavoidable expenditures including public funds, unless particularly strict laws are established, it will be difficult to achieve the urgent goal of establishing reserves. Therefore, if anyone has ideas beneficial to the domain's interests, regardless of rank or status, they should report directly to us without reserve.
Same. On the 1st day of the 3rd month, Hasegawa Takemon had previously reported that regarding the firearms training, as diligent practice had been conducted since last year, he wished to present a demonstration before the current departure. When this was privately consulted upon, as the number of practice sessions had not yet been sufficient, it was first declined. When this decision was conveyed to Takemon, today he again appeared and reported that while he found the decline honorable according to protocol, he strongly wished to present the demonstration and requested reconsideration. When this matter was reported again, although satisfaction was expressed, since the required number of shots had not been completed, this year's demonstration must definitely be declined, and he should inquire again after participating next year. This decision was conveyed to Takemon.
Same. On the 4th day of the same month, the following notice was issued by monthly inspector Ogino Nabehachiō:
　　As you have been appointed as a punctuation teacher, from the 10th onwards, please attend Sakurababa Shōzōdō from 5:00 to 8:00 in the morning at your convenience.

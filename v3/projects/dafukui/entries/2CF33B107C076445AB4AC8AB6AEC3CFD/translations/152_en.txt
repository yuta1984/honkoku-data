Item: On the return journey, stopped the palanquin at Ōmori for a brief rest. At that time, made a side visit to Kamo Myōjin shrine, worshipping while still in traveling attire. For purification water, one each of the inner guards and personal attendants who were advance guards at Daichōin went ahead to Ōmori after worship at Daichōin was completed, waited there and assisted. The escort commander led the procession and carried the sword. Everything was done in an informal manner, so the chamberlain did not attend. However, regarding this worship, since the Ōmori shrine priest had some connection beforehand, consultation was made through Shin'emon's side, and previously worship was conducted in this manner.

The performance stage was set up by moving together the thresholds of the Peacock Room adjacent to the formal reception room, and enclosing it with folding screens. Lord Kengoro entered at the front, while the duty chief retainers and pages, along with Lord Kengoro's attendants, sat in attendance at the rear entrance side. However, Kohei attended separately. The other assembled officials and both physicians viewed from the rest room with the sliding doors removed. The close attendant guards on duty also viewed from the same location. Besides the two duty guards of the inner quarters, Katayama Heishichi and Katō Dosaburō attended as facing guards. All of the above wore swords, same as those serving as companions. However, those seated in attendance before his lordship removed their long swords and placed their short swords behind them. All the preparations were handled by the close attendant guards.

However, during the three daily meals, when ordered to assemble and preparations were ready, the chief retainer reported and [his lordship] immediately entered. His formal wear was court dress with family crests, upper and lower garments. While not limited to court dress with crests, when the inner quarter guards inquired, he wore the crested court dress according to his wishes. When Lord Kengoro first entered, they met face-to-face in the small reception room, then immediately proceeded together to the viewing area. After the musical accompaniment concluded, they returned to the small reception room where thanks were expressed.

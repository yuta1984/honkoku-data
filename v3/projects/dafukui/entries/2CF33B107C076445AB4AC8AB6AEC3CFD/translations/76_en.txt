Same 1. Regarding swordsmanship, as his lordship is steadily progressing and improving, Heibei requested to gradually grant licenses and teach written traditions, asking to inquire about his lordship's private intentions. When Kobei inquired about this matter, Heibei's opinion was that although his lordship was satisfied, the matter of licenses is weighty in the school, and since his lordship still considers himself inexperienced, he should decline this time, which was his repeated intention. When this was conveyed to Heibei, he responded that while the deep consideration and respect for the school traditions is most grateful, since his lordship continues to progress, he very much wishes to provide instruction, and asked for another inquiry with this reasoning.

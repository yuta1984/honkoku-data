1. On the same day, [the lord] moved to the mansion at Tokiwabashi from today.

1. On the same day, from today, the metsuke (inspector) issued a directive that [the young heir] should be addressed as "殿様" (lord).

1. Fourth month, 29th day: Through the jōshaban (court attendant) Niwa Shikibu-shōyū as an envoy from above, thirty pieces of silver were bestowed as condolence money. When the envoy arrived, Shima-no-kami served as representative and went out to greet him as far as the gate's kick-board. 
As for Masaaki-sama, he went out to greet [the envoy] as far as the ceremonial entrance, and from there guided him to the reception hall. The shogun's intentions were conveyed (thirty pieces of white silver are bestowed as condolence money for the death of Matsudaira Nakatsukasa-dayū. We had heard that his illness was improving, so we did not make inquiries, but his sudden deterioration and death is deeply regrettable). Upon departure, [the lord] saw [the envoy] off to the same place where he had initially greeted him, and Shima-no-kami also saw him off in the same manner. As thanks for this, Shima-no-kami as representative dispatched a messenger from the goyōban to make rounds to the rōjū (senior councilors) and wakadoshiyori (junior councilors). Subsequently, Terasawa Kanzaemon, stationed in Kyoto, was dispatched as messenger to Matsudaira Iga-no-kami, the Kyoto deputy.
　Note: Although a letter should have been sent, due to [the heir's] young age, a messenger was dispatched instead.

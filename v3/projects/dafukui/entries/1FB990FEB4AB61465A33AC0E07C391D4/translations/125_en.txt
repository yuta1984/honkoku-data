1. Regarding crop inspections not being submitted: Although a tax increase of five rin per unit would normally be ordered, special consideration will be given and no tax increase will be imposed. Therefore, even if villages claim crop difficulties, given this year's circumstances, the magistrate's office should understand and listen, and arrange matters so that crop difficulty claims are not made. Although there will likely be no villages claiming crop difficulties given this year's weather conditions, if there are any particularly severe crop failures or difficulties, they should be investigated and reported in detail. In such cases, special inspection officials will be dispatched to conduct examinations.
Consult with the magistrate regarding the above matters and handle them appropriately.

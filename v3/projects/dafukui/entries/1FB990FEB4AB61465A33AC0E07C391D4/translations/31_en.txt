1. Kyōwa 3rd year, year of the boar (1803)

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the castle deputy and all department officials
○ Regarding financial affairs, His Lordship considers the hardship to be extreme. As announced in the spring of the year before last (year of the rooster), thorough investigations have been conducted. Among these, the auxiliary duties that were ordered were made extremely difficult due to the fire damage. The financial arrangements announced in the rooster year still remain inadequate. For construction works, using borrowed rice from retainers, official funds, and procured money, the residential quarters at the upper mansion have been completed to His Lordship's satisfaction. The Reiganjima construction project has been undertaken since this spring. As things are being managed in the usual peacetime manner, when investigations were made into the strict economizing measures that had been ordered beforehand, there was generally no proper accounting reconciliation. For this occasion, the primary concern is to thoroughly discuss the accounting reconciliation, which is His Lordship's intention. Regarding this matter, even very confidential consultations were held with important personages, who similarly consider the financial difficulties to be painful. Further economy measures are not considered to be realistic. It was agreed in consultation that it would be good to make special reductions by putting effort even into items for official presentation to the authorities, following this precedent. As it is thought that investigations will continue to be conducted, it is ordered that expenses for various matters be reduced even more. As announced previously, any matters that come to attention regarding what was communicated in previous years should be reported without reserve, so this should be understood accordingly.

1. Kansei 12, Year of the Monkey
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To Monthly Duty Officers
　○Due to long-standing financial difficulties, a policy was established from the previous Year of the Ox requiring half-reduced rice loans for seven years.
　　Despite enduring prolonged hardship, payments were made without delay, which pleased His Lordship greatly. Regarding this year, since the term limit has expired and moreover it is an exceptionally bad harvest year, there had been thorough consideration from earlier times to not impose rice loans, but due to urgent excessive expenditures pressing upon us, we cannot leave this matter to discretion alone. Therefore, eight-bu rice loans are hereby imposed. Furthermore, loan certificates backed by office silver will be issued as financial assistance. It was ordered that this matter be communicated. 1st month, 16th day. To all subordinate levels.
　　　　　Addition
○The seven-year half-reduced rice loans have been paid, and the retainer band has fallen into extreme poverty, causing great distress to His Lordship. During this term period, there were excessive emergency expenditures due to various auspicious and inauspicious events, making it difficult to maintain the established policy, particularly with the succession in the previous Year of the Sheep requiring unavoidable expenses for official duties at the shogunate and necessary residential relocations, creating severe financial difficulties. However, through the long-term half-reduced rice payments imposed on the retainer band, along with financial arrangements and new resourcefulness, immediate official duties were managed without hindrance, greatly satisfying His Lordship. Regarding this year, while the previously announced term limit has expired and there might be new announcements, due to such circumstances, it was reported to the shogunate that extraordinary frugality should be implemented following the precedent of previous lords. In accordance with this, the retainer band must also continue the省略 of all matters as has been done since the Year of the Ox, strictly observing frugality. For this year being an exceptionally bad harvest year, it would be problematic if economical measures were to slacken. One must serve by exercising utmost discretion.

　　It was ordered that this be communicated thoroughly.
　　　However, the format of all matters remains as before. Among these, improvements may be announced later, and the allocation of loan certificates and various borrowing and payment methods will be announced by the Finance Office.
　　　　　1st month, 16th day. To all subordinate levels.

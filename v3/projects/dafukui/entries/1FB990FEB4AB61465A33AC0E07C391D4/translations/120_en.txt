Having respectfully listened to and received permission for the consequences from the government magistrate's office, and having well understood our domain lord's compassion, there should no longer be any doubt, and henceforth we shall not raise any objections whatsoever to the religious instruction. If you submit your seal to Honganji Temple and then proceed to Edo, both domain law and compassion will be established, and the main temple will also favor matters of mercy - this would be a most excellent thing. If this is indeed your intention, the main temple will also make contact with you, so this should be well understood and communicated.

○The Nishi Honganji sect main temple and its followers have submitted to the consequences from the government magistrate's office this time, and have submitted a written pledge with their seals requesting that the investigation matter be withdrawn by Honganji Temple, and further requesting that our side also negotiate with Honganji Temple. Consequently, Mori Jiuemon was summoned from Kyoto and various negotiations were conducted. Therefore, two or three temples and two or three lay follower representatives should accompany Jiuemon to Kyoto for thorough discussions. However, those who were summoned should be excluded from going to Kyoto.

○Recently, people from other domains have been entering our domain, which interferes with our security measures, so the following should be communicated to each administrative head as per the attached document:
1. Regarding masterless samurai and street performers like "chongare mamezo," beyond ordinary interaction, careless involvement with them could naturally lead to assisting thieves, which would be detrimental to fire prevention and security. Therefore, village headmen should strictly order each household not to associate with them.
1. It is heard that merchant-type people from other domains have been particularly wandering about recently. They should also be told not to enter.
　　However, if there are those in rural areas who lodge such people, this is improper conduct. It is particularly heard that in rural areas, especially in Morita, Furuichi, Asamizu, Imaichi and such places, there are those who provide lodging. If such negligent behavior is reported in the future, punishment will be ordered.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Administrative Head
○Regarding the Nishi Honganji sect's religious doctrine, undesirable elements may have become involved. Since you have taken special trouble this time, there are reports of people claiming there will be offerings of gratitude money and various distributions to officials, and using this to solicit money from villages and embezzling it. This is misconduct. If such people are wandering about, they should be reported immediately.

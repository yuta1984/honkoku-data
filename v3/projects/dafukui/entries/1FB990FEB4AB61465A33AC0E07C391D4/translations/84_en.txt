Village officials should understand the above instructions and strictly enforce them accordingly. Ultimately, if lawless violence occurs, it is not a matter for your jurisdiction but an act against national governance, so there will be suppression measures from above, though regrettable. Therefore, ensure there are no misunderstandings and make this well understood.

○Due to ongoing financial difficulties and the fire damage to the Edo upper residence last spring causing critical disruptions, and with retainers particularly impoverished at this time, His Lordship has been deeply concerned. Since last spring, he has been in private consultation with Hitotsubashi Dainagon, who has already provided significant financial assistance. Other borrowing has covered considerable construction expenses. Regarding retainer poverty, relief measures have been continuously announced since last summer, but with rice prices falling and gold and silver circulation stagnating, the effects have been limited. Therefore, after various deliberations this year and the aforementioned exceptional fundraising and other arrangements, lending has been ordered.

1. Regarding lending: Though this has been done many times before, funds were diverted for temporary relief, principal and interest repayments accumulated, and contrary to expectations, results were unsatisfactory. This time, through exceptional methods, interest-free loans repayable over ten years will be granted upon application. Therefore, frugality must be observed even more strictly.
　　Note: Details of loan allocation methods will be communicated later by the accounting office.

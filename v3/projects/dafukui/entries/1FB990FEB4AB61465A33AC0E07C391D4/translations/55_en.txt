1. On February 9th last, domain physician Funaoka Shūhaku submitted the following written petition, which duty officer Shichizaemon forwarded to the senior retainers.

Verbal Report
In recent years, medical practice has gradually become insufficient, so we would like to establish a temporary school modeled after medical schools for medical training, setting up medical text lectures and study groups. Additionally, regarding medicinal products, if there are vacant tea garden lands available, we would appreciate being granted even small medicinal gardens so that we may all consult together and pursue our studies. Regarding this matter, we wish all town and rural medical practitioners to attend this school for medical training, and we request that this purpose also be officially announced. Above.

○Regarding smuggling of Chinese goods, the senior inspectors have issued notices that must be strictly observed, and this should be communicated to all subordinates. Furthermore, regarding coastal security measures, although repeated orders have been issued previously, it is heard that coastal areas where domain and other territories intermingle show particularly inadequate understanding. Therefore, first and foremost, the content of this official notice and the established procedures previously ordered by the domain must be strictly observed by coastal personnel without error.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Inspector
1. Regarding the forgiveness of half-reduction rice loans and the implementation of eight-percent rice loans, although all matters should return to their previous arrangements, given that the half-reduction rice loans have accumulated over many years during these times of hardship, as a temporary relief measure, all matters should continue to be conducted as ordered in the previous Year of the Monkey.

1. Regarding horses kept by retainers, as follows:
　1. Those with stipends of 600 koku or more shall keep horses within this year
　1. Those with stipends from 500 to 300 koku shall keep horses from next Year of the Ox
　1. Regarding horses kept by those receiving role stipends, this year they are exempted, with a rice loan of 50 koku out of their 100-koku role stipend.

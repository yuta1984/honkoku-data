○Regarding the control of rice shipments to various locations: Although there have been established regulations from long ago that should be strictly observed, perhaps due to some having incorrect understanding, recently during the storage of Osaka-bound rice ships, there have been frequent reports of excessive weight loss, with each party compensating by adding extra rice. Last summer's first shipment showed minimal weight loss and the shipping agents appeared to be taking proper care. However, subsequent shipments again showed excessive weight loss, with some parties making excessive compensation with additional rice. This ultimately does not benefit the shipping agents, and moreover, even if weight loss is compensated for, the primary concern is that the quality of rice bales deteriorates, causing excessive losses during official auctions, which must be investigated.
Therefore, from this spring onward, the handling by duty personnel shall be ordered to be even more strict, so shipping agents shall be instructed to consult together and take greater care in control methods. However, if there are those with incorrect understanding, they shall immediately be subject to official censure. This has been ordered, so this matter shall be communicated.

This causes great concern, but there is no choice but to make this request. Strict orders have been given regarding frugality both within and outside the domain, and it is hoped that these crucial duties can be carried out without hindrance. Regarding individual frugality, even during the current period of half-reduced borrowed rice in recent years, everyone should somehow manage and continue their duties with even greater ingenuity. It was proclaimed that these principles should be communicated. 20th day of the 1st month　To all subordinates
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Town and Four Districts Magistrate
○As each of you has gradually come to understand, assistance duties have been ordered this time, but the amount of tribute money is excessive, causing concern about how the financing can be arranged. Under each of your jurisdictions, procurement funds have been ordered in recent years through various financial measures, and detailed reports of hardship have been continuously submitted by each of you. These matters have reached His Lordship's attention and cause him great concern. However, since this major expenditure cannot be fully covered even by financial arrangements in other provinces due to its excessive nature, there is no choice but to order the levy of service money. Since official duties are of utmost importance as national service, everyone should work diligently and arrangements should be made accordingly. The amounts will be communicated by the magistrates.

○Assistance duties have been ordered this time, but the amount of tribute money is excessive, causing concern about financing methods. Regarding towns and rural areas, procurement funds have been ordered in recent years through various financial measures, and their diligent service has been satisfactory. Although their current state of hardship has reached His Lordship's attention and causes him great concern, due to the excessive tribute money, half-reduced borrowed rice has again been ordered for retainers, and with no other alternatives, service money must be levied. Since official

duties are of utmost importance as national service, everyone should work diligently. The amounts will be communicated by the magistrates.

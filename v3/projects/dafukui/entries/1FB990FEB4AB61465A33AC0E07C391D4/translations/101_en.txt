A silver levy was ordered to be distributed over two years. The allocation method will be communicated by the magistrates. Although the towns and rural areas are in extreme hardship at this time, we wish to ensure that official duties are carried out with proper authority, so each person should take great care and work diligently in their handling of these matters.

○Regarding the price of various midday meal rice: Since Kyōwa 2 (Year of the Dog), it was decided that it should be provided at five shō below the stipend rice price, but since there have been frequent price increases thereafter, as a special measure from this month it will be provided at the regular stipend rice price. Regarding this matter, first and foremost, the accounting office should have proper methods. If there are private dealings in various sectors, this becomes an obstacle to personnel assignments and also incurs expenses, so among the rotating personnel in various sectors who are engaged in private arrangements, the squad leaders should conduct investigations and report impartially in writing. Regarding private arrangements, orders may be given according to the circumstances and degree of each case, and after investigation, the number of rotating personnel may be reduced. If there are those who make excuses about concerns while having free time and do not follow the instructions of squad leaders, detailed reports should also be made about these cases. The above matters should be communicated as soon as they are reported.
1. Regarding this year's fire watch duty, personnel were assigned and despite serving at defense posts multiple times, various sectors have voluntarily contributed since midday meal rice was not provided as per internal communication - this is commendable. These matters should be made known.

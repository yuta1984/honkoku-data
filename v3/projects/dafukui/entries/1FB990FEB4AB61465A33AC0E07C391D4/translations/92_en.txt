○Regarding the written inquiry: For this collection of national duty money (国役金), everything should follow the village assessment registers (郷村高帳) that were submitted during the official seal revision in Tenmei 8 (1788). Even if there have been new rice field assessments since then, those portions should also be collected. Castle grounds, residential plots, and other villages with duty exemptions limited to the domain lord, post station relay and助郷 villages with exemptions do not qualify for exclusion. Even matters concerning high-stipend assessments should be levied if they exist within village territories. Regarding river-damaged wasteland, portions under 5% of village assessment also do not qualify for exemption. However, among these, if there are villages that have had special circumstances since long ago or possess official documents granting duty exemptions, they may be excluded after inquiry and instruction based on those circumstances. Please proceed with collection and payment with this understanding.

　　　Separate Paper
【The following two articles transcribed from next page】
○Regarding the Korean diplomatic mission coming to Tsushima next year, as this is a great ceremony in dealing with foreign countries, all houses should submit high-duty money and national duty money. It has been ordered that payment should be made over five years until the year of the Monkey. While this is an exceptional great ceremony that must be carried out without delay, our financial situation has been difficult for some time. Moreover, our residence has burned down twice in recent years, creating even greater difficulties. Furthermore, last year there was an unprecedented great flood in our domain, as reported each time. Rice field embankments, river controls, and levee breaks exceeded 200 locations, involving enormous distances. Other excessive damages were also as reported in our submissions. Tax collection fell to nearly half the assessment due to these circumstances. Unable to avoid this situation, we requested emergency rice reserves as recently ordered, and have gradually arranged construction funds, walking money, and seed loans, but due to the massive scale, we still cannot complete all construction work. While we must certainly pay both high-duty and national duties, we earnestly request that the payment deadline be extended multiple times. Both samurai households and townspeople have fallen into extreme poverty, making collection extremely difficult. We earnestly request an extension of the payment period, as instructed by our domain representatives. We hereby submit this inquiry. The above.

Honorable Magistrate

○Regarding the rice town market certificate merchants, while this system had existed previously, in Meiwa 8 (Year of the Rabbit), two supervisors were appointed, and all joint affairs were assigned to the official rice wholesalers. A commission fee of 2 bu per 100 bags of rice for buying and selling was ordered to be paid. Later, three supervisors were appointed and continued to serve until this time. However, regarding the commission fees, in Kansei 11 (Year of the Sheep), due to the official reform policy, 1 monme per 100 bags of rice for buying and selling was ordered to be paid. Since a sudden increase would cause hardship, upon petition, 4 monme each for selling and buying was ordered to be paid, which has been submitted until now. This time, the official policy has been revised: the three market supervisors are dismissed, and the joint participation of official rice wholesalers is also exempted. Additionally, the collection of commission fees, which had been ordered based on rice quantities, is now discontinued. Therefore, henceforth, the number of rice brokers will be determined and stock certificates will be issued after examination.

Since the number of broker stocks has been fixed, regardless of the annual number of bags traded, an annual offering of 100 silver pieces, plus 260 monme for meeting house expenses including ink and brush costs, totaling 4,560 monme, is ordered to be paid. This should be collected monthly at 380 monme per month. Furthermore, regarding market supervision, the previously established regulations must be strictly observed without any improper handling. Monthly detailed accounting must be conducted, and monthly headmen, annual magistrates, and all other matters must be handled with utmost strictness. A joint signature document regarding supervision methods should be kept on file.

[The following two articles are transcribed from the next page]
1. Since market supervisors have been abolished, henceforth one person from the magistrate's group shall be present every month on the 3rd and 8th from 7 PM until dusk, recording the day's settlement details in the ledger, and any unusual matters should be reported to the accounting office.

1. At the meeting house, nothing except tea, tobacco, and trays should be served. Regardless of circumstances, alcohol, sweets, and similar items must never be provided.

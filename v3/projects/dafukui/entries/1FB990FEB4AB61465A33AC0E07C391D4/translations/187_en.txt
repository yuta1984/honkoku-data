　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Town and Four-District Magistrates

○Regarding domain finances, due to enormous expenses in recent years, silver contributions were requested from substantial townspeople and rural residents in the previous Year of the Rabbit. As a result of their meritorious offerings, silver contributions have been forthcoming, which is exceptionally convenient and satisfactory. However, due to the extremely difficult financial situation that has continued, unavoidably half-reduction borrowed rice has been imposed on the retainer households. Although the townspeople and rural areas are also in a state of long-standing hardship, which causes concern for their suffering, due to the unavoidable fate of domain finances, rotating credit associations (tanomoshi-kō) are being requested. Details will be discussed among the magistrates, so each should give careful attention and arrange matters appropriately so that the requests are fulfilled

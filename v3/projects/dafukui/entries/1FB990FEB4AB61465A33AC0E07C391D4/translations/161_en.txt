As this situation has been reported, after thorough investigation, regarding falcon hunting roads, the sites designated for hunting grounds, public fees, shared territories with other domains, and other areas, efforts should be made to reduce construction sites for falcon hunting roads as much as possible.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Elder Councilor
○This time, financial tightening has been ordered for all government offices, so the attached document is provided. Please understand this and communicate it also to the sword magistrate and the inner storehouse official.
　　　　　Attached Document
○Financial affairs have long been difficult, and we have managed by delaying payments through various expedients, but debts have gradually accumulated, making it unavoidable for everyone to request payment deferrals. Regarding this, when examining regular and extraordinary expenses, comparing the account books for Bunka 7-8 (Horse-Sheep years) and Bunka 11-12 (Dog-Boar years), the Dog-Boar years show enormous increases in expenses. While some offices have reduced expenses, most have increased them. Since there were no particularly extraordinary duties, yet expenses increased in the Dog-Boar years, this appears entirely due to inadequate regular financial management, which is particularly inexcusable. Therefore, expenses should return to the levels of the Horse-Sheep years. Even from those expense levels, further reductions should be carefully implemented.
　　　　　(However, this attached document should be distributed one copy each to all government offices. Only those sections with additional itemized lists not recorded here are noted.)
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chief Retainer

1. For travel to and from Edo, gifts to rivers, inns, honjin, and others should be reduced as much as possible.
1. For the above occasions, horse transportation fees should be reduced after examination.
1. For the above occasions, gifts to retainers should be uniformly stopped, except for unavoidable circumstances which should be reconsidered before giving.
1. Various gifts in both Edo and the domain should be reduced as much as possible.
1. Secretary quarters, various papers, and all other supplies should be strictly reduced.
　These matters should be carefully implemented.

　To be communicated to all sectors　　Inspector
○Regarding gifts to the household retainers and others, proportional reductions have been ordered in recent years, leading to considerable confusion. This time, with tightening measures announced for all sectors, all such gifts should be stopped and replaced with stipend allocations; unavoidable items should be re-examined before giving. Also, reductions have been ordered for various goods and distributed items.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Town Magistrate
○Regarding the family temple, as this is a special matter, construction and repair items have been appropriately ordered until now, but since tightening measures for government offices have been announced, from this Ox year forward, construction and repair items cannot be handled as they have been previously, so this should be communicated to the family temple for their advance understanding.

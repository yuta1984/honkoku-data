○Regarding the delayed installment payments of the service money previously ordered, although the magistrates have repeatedly urged payment, due to the current time of hardship, it is difficult to both announce and implement the current payment deadlines. The Fukui townspeople and four districts have completed their installment payments according to the set schedule. The claim of hardship is a general matter, not limited to Fuchū town and rural areas. Even if the Kuranosuke office has had borrowing money for private use in recent years, this current service money is naturally a special matter, and the officials should understand this point and proceed accordingly. However, since continued delays are unacceptable, it is ordered that deadlines be promptly set and strict collection be implemented for payment.

○Regarding the frequent major floods recently, His Lordship is deeply concerned and has issued the following separate document. This matter should be handled through thorough consultation. Regarding this, immediate inspection by ourselves has been ordered. Since there may also be negotiations with other domains, after careful examination, thorough deliberation should be conducted and appropriate measures taken.
　　　　　　　Separate Document
○After the major flood during the Genbun era, there were no particularly major floods until recent years, but since the major flood of the first year of Kansei (Year of the Rooster), there have been frequent floods each year, endangering not only rice fields and farmland but even houses, causing universal hardship. His Lordship is deeply troubled and has ordered deliberation and investigation. It was found that recently river channels have become silted or sediment deposits have formed, making the river configuration poor. River construction work should be ordered for this, but it is not a fundamental solution and resources are limited. First, if drainage improves, water accumulation would naturally decrease. Therefore, among the willows and various trees on both banks of the river channels, the regulation measurements should be maintained, but all others should be completely cut down. Since tree cutting is ordered under public law, it should be thoroughly instructed that the responsible villages have no misunderstanding.

○Due to being ordered to guard duty for the Zojoji Temple fire last summer, it was unavoidable to order the payment of tribute silver until next year, which is considered burdensome. However, due to the Korean embassy visit, the shogunate has ordered high-duty gold and provincial duty gold payments. Therefore, from the coming Year of the Sheep, the payment of this high-duty gold is ordered, so this year's tribute silver payment is exempted. The allocation method for the high-duty gold will be communicated later by the magistrates

○On October 17th of the following Year of the Sheep, the notice from the Accounting Office was as follows:

One: For stipend holders - Payment from November 15th to 20th, from 5 to 8 AM
【The above clause is transcribed from the next page】
One: For rice stipend recipients, support rice recipients, relief rice recipients, and bale quota recipients - From November 21st to 29th, same time as above
This concerns the high-duty silver and provincial duty gold payments ordered by the shogunate in spring of the previous Year of the Dragon for the Korean embassy visit in the following Year of the Snake. Upon petition, the three-year payment was postponed from the Year of the Dragon to the Year of the Sheep, and now payment over five years from this Year of the Sheep to the coming Year of the Boar has been ordered. Therefore, from the lowest retainers to all craftsmen, according to the separate document, silver amounts are allocated proportionally for tribute payment, so every year payment should be made to the payment office within the specified time limit.

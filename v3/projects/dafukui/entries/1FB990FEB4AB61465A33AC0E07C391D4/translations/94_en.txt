1. To ensure no losses in rice tax handling, continue with proper procedures as before. For rice testing (sashimai), no additional testing beyond three tests shall be performed. Even if re-examination of rejected rice (hanmai) is requested, it shall not be leniently approved.
However, if re-examination of rejected rice is strongly requested for unavoidable reasons, re-examination of up to one test may be conducted for decision. Generally, for any additional testing performed, the reason, village name, and personal names must be recorded and reported. For work done at remote locations, report upon return.

1. If there are those who pretend to take rejected rice home but use schemes to divert it directly for tax payment, immediately reject without testing and report the person's name and village name. For work done at remote locations, report upon return.

Attached note:
Regarding this matter, some pretend to take rejected rice home but do not actually take it home, diverting it for tax payment instead. When this happens repeatedly, natural rice reduction occurs through testing. Some use this as grounds to make complaints that the officials are not performing properly.

[The above two articles transcribed from the next page]
Both sides must be investigated to distinguish the truth.

1. No private testing bamboo shall be used except for the testing bamboo distributed by the Finance Office.
As stated above, officials handling rice tax collection at Akesato Granary, various branch granaries, and other locations must properly understand joint rice inspection procedures and handle matters correctly. If any improper private methods are discovered, report the matter immediately. Severe punishment will follow.

Therefore, regarding the procurement funds from each jurisdiction, annual installment loans in two categories, and requested lecture funds, from this Dragon year until the Horse year, unavoidably within three years, one-third of the previous amounts will be provided as loans. Consult with the Magistrate to thoroughly communicate this unavoidable situation and handle appropriately.

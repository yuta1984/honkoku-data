Chief of the Great Guard

○ Regarding the loan of rice bales that was granted upon request due to financial difficulties among members of each guard unit, a second petition on this matter cannot be taken up. However, due to special circumstances, loans are granted with each person taking responsibility as outlined in the separate document. This matter should be communicated to each person respectively.
However, two bales each, totaling twenty-one people. Among these, some were already granted loans on the 27th.
As stated above, loans are granted with the guard chief taking responsibility, to be repaid by the end of the coming Year of the Rat (Bunka 1).
Same day, 29th

First, Bunka 3, Year of the Tiger
To the Chief of the Great Guard
○ Regarding the petition from members of the Great Guard unit that was communicated last December, various matters have now been brought to attention through Sano Naizen and Eguchi Genzaemon. You should understand this accordingly. Based on this, please deliberate thoroughly. However, since it would be unreasonable for hereditary retainers to trouble their superiors with weighty petitions, they should be well instructed once more before communicating again.
January 14th
Note: The above document was handed to Ota Saburobyoe, the monthly duty officer from Inaba Tosho's office. While this matter should have been communicated to Edo by the next messenger, since colleague Genzaemon was ordered to return on official business, he carried it with him, so it was not sent separately. Naizen and Genzaemon departed on the 17th of the same month.

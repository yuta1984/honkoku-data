Kyōwa 1 (1801)

Official Notice　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To All Monthly Duty Officers
○Regarding the financial difficulties that have persisted through successive generations, the fundamental problem is that the domain's land assessment and tax collection are insufficient, and expenditures do not balance with income, resulting in accumulated debt and hardship.
His Excellency the Chūjō (domain lord) has exerted great effort and established exceptional policies in previous years, but expenditures have gradually increased beyond what can be managed. The current lord continues to work even harder, and after strict investigation of the balance between income and expenditures, he has acknowledged that shortfalls are unavoidable. Consequently, economy measures are being implemented in all matters, and there are internal adjustments that have been reported to the bakufu. Regarding year-end payments and other matters, recent reductions by half, borrowed rice, and other measures are being taken, and retainers should also follow these guidelines in observing frugality without any misunderstanding.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Castle Deputy and All Officials
○The financial difficulties are not a recent development and are well known to everyone.
His Excellency the Chūjō, wishing to ensure there would be no inconvenience, has conducted thorough investigations into future matters, but found only unavoidable obstacles that prevent things from proceeding as desired, which is most regrettable. Therefore, as announced yesterday, regarding economy measures that are under internal adjustment and have been reported to the bakufu, it is his wish that matters concerning personal status and economy be reported without reservation. Of course, regarding individual official duties, even small matters should be approached with dedicated attention to economy and diligent effort. Additionally, corrections to the relaxation of previously announced economy measures are under current internal adjustment, and further announcements will be made in due course, so this matter is to be communicated accordingly.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Inspectors
○Regarding the directive from the Senior Inspectors issued last December concerning the investigation of name changes and other transfers of sake brewers since Tenmei 8 (1788), the results should be submitted by the 20th of this month. This should be communicated to the Town Magistrates, District Magistrates, and District Magistrates of Entrusted Territories. It should also be communicated to Fuchū. However, this matter should be conveyed to each party immediately.

1. The district deputies have shown exceptional diligence in recent years, resulting in increased tax collection, but last year (Year of the Monkey) the harvest was poor, leading to decreased collection.

　　　　　2nd month, 16th day

1. Regarding the summons of Nishi Honganji sect branch temples and lay followers within the domain, the document submitted to Temples and Shrines Magistrate Wakisaka Nakatsukasa-no-taifu on the 11th day past is as follows:
　　　Regarding the summons of Nishi Honganji sect branch temples in your named territory, when announced in the domain, the current summons appears to be for unknown official business that is difficult to fathom, but since there has long been a matter of religious doctrine, it is deeply suspected to be entirely related to that matter. Lay followers gather daily in large numbers at the castle town office, sometimes five to six hundred people, sometimes two to three thousand to ten thousand people, creating extraordinary disturbance, and they request that the lord petition to stop the summons. Since this is indeed a serious summons, officials have strictly explained the consequences, but they completely refuse to listen and will not accept any handling of the matter. It was communicated that the officials are greatly troubled by this situation.

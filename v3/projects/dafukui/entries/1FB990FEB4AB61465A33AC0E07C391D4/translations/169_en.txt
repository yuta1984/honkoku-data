Regarding the transfer orders

Those who are unavoidably ill are exceptional cases. There may be others making private requests due to financial circumstances, etc., but those capable of serving guard duty should not make private requests for retirement, and the guard captains should take even greater sincere care in this matter, according to the lord's directive

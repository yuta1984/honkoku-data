○ Regarding the uneven ground in Matsumoto district, when leveling of field boundaries was ordered last winter, the aforementioned two temples and a person named Jinbei raised objections from the beginning, refused to affix their seals to the consent documents, and persistently insisted on their own way in an insubordinate manner. Therefore, the landholdings of Chintoku-ji Temple, Kokushō-ji Temple, and Jinbei have been confiscated and designated as general domain land. The deputies should be informed of this matter and handle it accordingly.

○ Regarding adoptions and marriage arrangements for women in the lord's retainer group, since marriages between different ranks are not favored by His Lordship, reforms were ordered in the 9th year of Kansei (Year of the Snake).

This matter should be communicated to Kuranosuke's household.

○ Regarding the floating of timber and other materials donated from rural areas for the reconstruction of various temples, strict orders have been issued repeatedly since ancient times.

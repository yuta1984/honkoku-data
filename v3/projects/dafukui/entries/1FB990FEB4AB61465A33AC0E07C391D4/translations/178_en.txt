　Furthermore, since the recent celebratory events have resulted in enormous expenses and caused financial strain, though burdensome, each person is requested to procure 1,500 ryo of gold, totaling 6,000 ryo this winter, and they should be strongly instructed to make every effort to fulfill this.
　　However, regarding this request, the silver procured in the Rat Year by the policy office shall have its repayment completed at the same location.
　Additionally,
　　The procurement silver that was transferred to the policy office when assistant agents for internal procurement were appointed in the Dog Year shall again be taken over by the main office, with the principal remaining borrowed as before and interest of four shu per month to be provided.

○According to the domain's financial system, borrowing silver has been granted for repair costs of military equipment for lower-ranking samurai in the household guard. You are hereby appointed as the dedicated supervisor for this matter, so please handle it after thorough consideration of repair methods. The amount of borrowing silver will vary from year to year. For details, consult with the inspectors.

Important message from inspectors to unit commanders:
○Regarding repairs of military weapons in the household guard, procurement is difficult due to current circumstances, and particularly for armor and such, repairs of old and damaged items may not be adequately addressed. Therefore, from now on, we wish to provide lending silver annually in small amounts through a special system. However, since we cannot accommodate large numbers of applicants, we have a system to grant borrowing according to the domain's financial situation. If anyone wishes to apply, tell them to consult with the Arms Administrator. Please also mention this matter to members of your units when appropriate.

Guidelines when supervisors receive consultations from household guard members:
○This system aims to provide exceptionally generous support for household guard weapons, but without provisions given current circumstances, procurement is difficult. The higher authorities also need money and face financial difficulties, making such measures difficult. Therefore, we have a system of small annual loans. However, since it would be impossible with too many people, we plan to lend to about 20 people annually. Regarding procedures before and after lending, handle them sequentially when unavoidable.

[The following two articles are transcribed from the next page]
However, among weapons, we will first begin with armor, and after armor is completed, we will proceed to other weapons.

1. After weapons are completed, if someone worries about fires etc. in peacetime and requests storage, the authorities will store them. They may be returned at any time for repairs or airing, etc.

1. Exchanging good items later is also freely permitted.

1. Even for items currently possessed without borrowing, requesting storage due to fire concerns is fully possible.

1. Whether to lend a certain amount of silver to one person interest-free with ten-year installment payments, and use that money with additional funds for repairs, or purchase new items, is up to individual judgment.

Convey these points to those who hear them, and for those who apply, lending will be provided according to circumstances.

Note: On January 20th, the magistrate reported that regarding military equipment repair funds that had been under internal consideration since last winter, instructions were given by the senior councilors on the 16th, so arrangements were made as per the separate document. This was conveyed for acknowledgment, so it is recorded here.

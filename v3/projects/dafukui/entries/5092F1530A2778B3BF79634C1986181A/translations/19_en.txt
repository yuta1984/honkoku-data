○Financial affairs have long been inadequate, and when the Reiganjima residence suffered fire damage this spring, immediate reconstruction work was ordered one after another. However, due to critical obstacles, His Lordship made exceptional decisions to consult with important officials and submit petitions to the shogunate. From this Year of the Ox (Bunsei 12, 1829) for ten years, comprehensive cost-cutting measures for financial recovery have been ordered. Regarding the retainers, from this year for seven years, half-reduced rice loans will be requested. Although this will cause increased hardship on top of existing poverty, which causes His Lordship great concern, it is unavoidable fate, so everyone must exercise patience and perform their duties faithfully. Further announcements may follow. This matter is to be communicated as ordered.
　Regarding this, Nonaka Kenzō has been dispatched.

○From this Year of the Ox for ten years, comprehensive cost-cutting measures beginning with His Lordship's household for financial recovery have been announced. To reduce various miscellaneous expenses in rural areas and increase tax collection, the following control measures are ordered:

1. Regarding gifts from peasants to officials: Although this has been prohibited repeatedly, it appears to have gradually slackened. Originally, it is improper for village officials and leading figures to come to the castle town and associate with domain retainers through connections. Henceforth, contact with officials other than direct supervisors is prohibited. Even when meeting with direct supervisors, gifts of local tea garden products and such are strictly forbidden.

1. Village headmen and those granted special privileges, regardless of their status, both men and women, shall not use silk fabrics for saki-ori, cotton garments, obi sashes, sleeve openings, collars, etc. Silk materials are strictly prohibited.
　　However, formal dress received from domain retainers, including kamishimo, hakama, and other garments with silk threads, are strictly forbidden to wear.

1. Regarding rural construction: Recently there has been a trend toward preferring luxury. Henceforth, except for sturdy construction, pursuing luxury is strictly forbidden.
　　However, for storehouses and granaries for storing miscellaneous grains and farm tools, restraining oneself thinking they might appear extravagant from the outside would actually be useless in emergencies, so such concerns are unnecessary.

1. Village headmen have recently been permitted to wear swords during inspection visits, but this has led to abuse of authority and oppression of lower-ranking people, which is ultimately harmful to villages. Therefore, sword-wearing is henceforth prohibited.

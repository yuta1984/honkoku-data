this matter has been granted clemency, so henceforth [you] must strictly observe the laws. Furthermore, this time for control purposes, inspectors have been appointed among the Fukui paper merchants, so this matter should be understood.
As ordered above, all paper merchants henceforth should have no misunderstandings, and if there are any lawbreakers, particularly severe punishments will be imposed, so this matter should be conveyed without omission.

                        To All Officials
○The domain's finances have long been in difficulty, and although various expedients have been employed to manage affairs, emergency expenditures continue to mount, creating financial hardships. Originally, since revenues have no surplus and finances are tight, annual deficits accumulate, and when unavoidable additional expenses arise, the burden of carrying them forward creates even greater obstacles. Under such circumstances, without strict economizing measures and tight controls in ordinary times, [the situation] cannot be resolved. Therefore, this time comprehensive reforms and exceptional frugality have been ordered. Each [official], to the extent that [you] face difficulties, should constantly keep this well in mind, and beyond official duties and expenses, regarding daily official business and internal affairs, [you] should take utmost care. Regardless of past practices, [you] should sincerely implement the reforms and economies, establish financial methods for maintaining domain finances, and through handling methods that allow affairs to proceed smoothly, even in the most minor matters, [you] should distinguish between losses and gains and serve with integrity for the domain's benefit. If [we] fall into further difficulties, it will cause hardship, so it is essential that each [official] keep this in mind, work together harmoniously, and consult on administrative economizing. Moreover, if there are matters that should be economized or ideas for domain benefit, [these] should be reported regardless of whether they will be adopted. Of course, as previously ordered, bribery and gifts must strictly not be accepted.
The above principles should be strictly enforced down to the lowest ranks without misunderstanding.

○Regarding stipends in silver and rice granted to retainers and others, economizing measures have been repeatedly ordered, but some have been unable to manage accordingly. However, due to this exceptional reform, henceforth all such grants will be discontinued. Nevertheless, for those directions where [grants] are unavoidable, there will be separate deliberation after examining the circumstances.
1. Regarding the finance office, [officials] have been granted borrowing according to past practices and for unavoidable expenses through deliberation, but due to this reform, henceforth all [such borrowing] will be discontinued. Nevertheless, if there are unavoidable directions, after examination, interest-bearing loans from the official silver reserves may be granted.

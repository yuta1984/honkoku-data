○ This strict law and frugality measure differs in form from the cost-cutting measures that have been announced repeatedly until now. Originally, the domain treasury has been burdened by excessive expenditures for current needs, leading to mounting debts year after year, making it extremely difficult to restore financial health, inevitably falling into dire financial straits. Consequently, from the lord's personal allocated funds to the allowances of various retainers, all have been reduced by nearly half, causing great inconvenience. Regarding this matter, without being bound by old precedents in various departments and without getting mired in inconvenient matters, exceptional methods should be established by all means so that current expenses may be reduced by half. Department heads and their subordinates should each exhaust their efforts, consult with each other without concealment, investigate with sincerity and report, so that the policy of financial restoration may be thoroughly understood and implemented.

○ Regarding the selection of temple successors, while there have been temple regulations, recently successors have been chosen based on dharma lineage connections, naturally resulting in monks with insufficient religious practice and learning becoming head priests, which has become a source of doubt within the sect. Henceforth, regardless of the closeness of dharma lineage, monks with virtue, capability, and learning within the same sect should be selected and requested as successors. If there are inadequacies in the selection process, not only the previous abbot but the entire dharma community of the same sect would be considered at fault.

1. Regarding installation ceremonies and conduct, recently there have been reports of increasingly improper extravagance, which is quite problematic. Henceforth, without being bound by ancient customs

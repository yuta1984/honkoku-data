October 15th - Regarding the above matter, due to Yamada Keijun's indisposition, Ōita Kinai informed Yamamoto Seihaku

To the Senior Councilors and all
Administrative departments

○Due to the long-standing financial difficulties in domain finances, reforms for fiscal austerity measures were ordered to all administrative departments in the previous Year of the Dog, and particularly from last year, comprehensive cost-cutting measures were ordered starting from the lord's personal expenses. Due to these exceptional reforms, further orders have been issued to various departments after investigation. While there should be no misunderstanding of these matters, it has been ordered that one must maintain frugality and perform duties with integrity. Furthermore, the following has been ordered this time:

1. During the period of half-reduction, regarding the regular stipends and standard disbursements in silver and rice for all departments, while there have been previous orders for reductions, this time each department shall exercise careful consideration and, regardless of precedent, shall reduce everything by half from the standard amount through sincere deliberation.

1. Stipend substitute payments in gold and silver, as well as gold, silver, and rice allocations outside of regular stipends, shall all be reduced by half from the standard amount.

1. All goods distributions shall be reduced by 20%.

1. All monetary and rice allowances for retainers were completely suspended in the previous Year of the Dog, and for those departments that unavoidably require renewed allowances due to their duties, future distributions shall be half of the standard amount.

For Pages and Chamberlains - among the orders issued:
1. Summer cotton garments and light blue cotton distributed twice yearly to military procurement staff shall be distributed only once during the period of reduction.

Stable Superintendent:
1. Horse medicine costs shall be reduced by two-thirds from the standard amount during the designated period.
1. Horse feed standard prices shall be reduced by 20% from the standard amount.
1. Clothing allowances for stable attendants shall be reduced by 20% from the standard amount.

Physicians:
1. Regarding medicine fees, whereas one silver piece was given for prescriptions from one to one hundred doses, during the designated period, silver shall be given at the rate of one piece per hundred doses according to the number of medicines prescribed.
Note: This applies equally to powdered medicines, pills, medicinal powders, and ointments.

Minor Equipment Department:
1. For tea ceremony charcoal, inner quarters oil and candles, washroom charcoal, bathhouse firewood, and tea room charcoal - the regular allocations for these departments shall be reduced by 20% from the standard amount during the designated period.

Summary:
1. The overnight duty system for kitchen supervisors and inspectors shall be discontinued, and the fire watch personnel shall patrol even more diligently.

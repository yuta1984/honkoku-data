To the Three-District Magistrate  
○Sake brewers under jurisdiction had their brewing suspended due to high grain prices since last year, but after petitioning, they were permitted to brew at two-bu rate (20%). However, they sold out their old sake by early autumn and became unable to conduct business, falling into extreme hardship. Regarding this, they submitted a petition requesting forgiveness for new sake brewing, and when this matter was reported to the Senior Councilors, permission was granted for new sake brewing as in the previous year.

To the Three-District Magistrate
○Those listed separately under jurisdiction are new sake brewers, but after being suspended last year, they were permitted limited sake sales for 100 days and requested to provide wholesale sake to established, trusted parties. However, since this was originally two-bu brewing, supplies were insufficient and adequate wholesale was not possible, so they unavoidably engaged in small-scale illegal brewing. Going forward, this will be prohibited, and subsequently the said sake will be confiscated as is, and later silver [payment/fine]

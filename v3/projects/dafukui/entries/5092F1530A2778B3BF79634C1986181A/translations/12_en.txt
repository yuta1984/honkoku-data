Regarding public duties, since these are official government service matters and are of great importance, you are ordered to take responsibility for all matters and be concerned about economizing. Of course, such matters are not easy, and since there have been ongoing requests for domain deposits and loans, it would not do for there to be inconveniences in government affairs, so understanding this intention and ensuring no interference before or after through careful consideration and discretion is of primary importance. Also, since you have served meritoriously for years, regarding matters outside official duties that come to your attention, you should discuss them without reserve with the relevant officials to achieve economies. Furthermore, regarding details, Kaifuku Sazaemon will come to Edo with full knowledge of the situation, so this policy should be thoroughly discussed repeatedly.

○Regarding town affairs, we hear that poverty increases yearly, and among the townspeople, some are gradually falling into destitution, which is viewed with concern. Originally, their understanding of making a living is poor, and moreover, without considering the profits of their commerce, they have gradually grown extravagant in clothing, food, and housing, leading to the loss of their occupations. Although orders for frugality have been issued repeatedly from before, these have slackened over the years, so this time with special compassion, strict adherence to restraint is ordered as per the attached document. This is so that the townspeople's livelihoods do not fall into ruin but can be sustained, so it is essential that each person understand correctly and diligently pursue their occupation without neglect. Especially, leading figures should observe their proper station and constantly take care to provide guidance so that small merchants can maintain their livelihoods.

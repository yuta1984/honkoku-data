[continuing from previous page] through silver payment, we humbly accept this arrangement. However, since business has become impossible and hardship is extreme, like other sake brewers, their petition for permission to engage in original brewing has been approved.

To the Town Magistrate
○Regarding the matter of the flying gold kesa, since Unshōji Temple recently made a petition concerning this, it has been decreed as stated in the separate document, so please communicate this matter.
　Separate Document
○Regarding the wearing of flying gold kesa by senior monks of the Chinzei sect, since they serve as representatives when there are issues with Unshōji Temple's registry and present incense burners and such, through special consideration this time and after consultation with Zōjōji Temple, the wearing of flying gold kesa by senior monks is permitted throughout the domain.
　However, when senior monks transfer or pass away, these shall be collected and reported accordingly.
This is to be communicated to Unshōji Temple as stated above.

To the Monthly Duty Officers
○Due to years of financial difficulties and the unavoidable fire at Reigan Island in the recent Year of the Ox, a policy was necessarily established imposing half-reduction borrowed rice for seven years. Despite enduring long hardship, you have made payments without delay, which is most satisfactory. Learning that retainers are in dire straits and that all will face hardship causes great concern. Although the term has not yet expired, the half-reduction will be lifted from the coming Year of the Sheep. While there is desire to forgive all borrowed rice, due to unexpected excessive expenditures from various fortunate and unfortunate events during this period, this cannot be discontinued, so eight-bu rate borrowed rice is imposed. Of course, regarding various payments, maintain the same understanding as up to the recent Year of the Rat. Since all are enduring hardship while serving, practice even stricter economy and continue serving with the same省略 in all matters as before.
　However, this year as well, stipends, though small, will be provided to retainers at all levels. Details will be announced by the Accounting Office.

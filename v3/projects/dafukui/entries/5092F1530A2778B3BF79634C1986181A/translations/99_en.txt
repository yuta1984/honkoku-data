If the estimates naturally result in successful bids, thorough examination shall be conducted at the construction office to ensure no disagreements arise later.

Regarding gifts (inmono), while strict orders have been issued previously, this particular matter involves special circumstances and has been ordered with particular severity. Those who act improperly will face punishment. Those who work properly will be dealt with appropriately after examination, so this should be communicated to all relevant parties.

As the senior retainers have communicated the above, it shall be relayed to all those involved in official duties down to the lowest levels.

○ Regarding rice deliveries to the various granaries, it has been reported that in recent years the farmers have been negligent in repairs and maintenance. First, the quality of rice is poor. Moreover, while the cultivation methods for early rice in the villages should follow standard procedures, recent practices have made it impossible to properly determine the grades of granary rice. Therefore, for this year, all granary locations are ordered to conduct sincere examinations of not only rice quality but also repairs and drying processes before handling deliveries. At the deputy's offices, this shall be explained to the farmers to ensure they understand and have no misunderstandings, and they shall be strictly instructed accordingly.

○ Regarding the prohibition of advance selling and buying of new rice, while orders have been issued previously, sake brewers in the castle town and elsewhere, as well as those who might engage in secret purchasing, should not exist. However, if there are any who act improperly, they will certainly face punishment. Sake brewing should also be suspended, but since this year's harvest is good and deliveries to the various granaries are expected to proceed smoothly, sake brewing will be permitted according to standard ratios in due course. At that time, rice for sake brewing will be distributed, so the purchasing of rice for sake brewing is increasingly strictly prohibited. Even if requests are made to export sake to other domains, these will not be processed, and offshore shipments are strictly forbidden.
These instructions shall be communicated thoroughly to all relevant parties.

○ Regarding sake brewing, which was previously suspended, since this year's harvest has turned out reasonably well, sake brewers are permitted to brew two units each per establishment for the time being. Strict instructions shall be given to ensure no other misunderstandings occur.

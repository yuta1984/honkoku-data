　　　　　　The content that the Senior Councilors conveyed regarding matters to be announced after consultation with the Three-District Magistrates is as follows:
○ Regarding small-scale commerce in rural areas, this was previously announced but recently it has been heard that it has become excessive. Henceforth, in areas where occupations have been suspended, coastal areas, along highways and other villages, those who are ill or wives who cannot engage in agriculture and have no means of livelihood are exceptional cases, but applications for permits for small-scale commerce from other persons shall not be accepted.
1. Even those who have been previously permitted to engage in small-scale commerce must cease, as it is only for one generation and cannot continue. Also recently, some have built restaurant-teahouse style rooms selling sake and food, and providing lodging for young people for pleasure, which has generally come to attention and is improper conduct. Henceforth, if such matters occur, strict punishment shall be ordered after investigation.
　As stated above, village headmen, senior farmers, and five-household group leaders in all villages must strictly understand this and handle enforcement severely. If there is any negligence, not only the individual concerned but also the village officials shall be held accountable.

○ Regarding the use of items bearing the hollyhock crest for private purposes at ancestral temples, and carrying lanterns with the crest at night even when claiming official business, it has been previously announced that this is forbidden. Since announcements have been made to all temples and shrines this time, they must be strictly informed again to avoid any misunderstandings.

○ Among temples and shrines, some have traditionally enshrined memorial tablets of successive lords based on historical connections and possess and use items with the hollyhock crest. While some may be donated items, henceforth the use of items with the crest shall be entirely forbidden. Regarding donations, they shall be kept as temple/shrine treasures. If there are any misunderstandings, strict official notice shall be given.
　　However, temples and shrines with special historical connections that have been permitted to use crested lanterns during religious ceremonies after petitioning must still consult with the administrative office for instructions.
1. Adoption contracts with court nobles by temples shall be forbidden.
　　However, if there are special historical reasons and a petition is made, it may be permitted depending on investigation.
　The above points shall be conveyed to temple and shrine personnel.

　Keichō 17, Year of the Water Rat (1612)
　　一　10th month (day not specified)
　　　　While Lord Toranosuke (the date of his name change is not specified) was in Edo, he heard about a disturbance in Kitanoshō, Echizen Province (a dispute between Kuze Tajima and Okabe Jikyū) and became concerned. He wished to go to Kitanoshō to join with Lord Tadanao in pacifying the situation and requested leave of absence. When the Divine Lord (Tokugawa Ieyasu) heard of this, he declared: "Though you are young in years, your intentions are commendable, but I will summon both parties later for official judgment, so please refrain from going."

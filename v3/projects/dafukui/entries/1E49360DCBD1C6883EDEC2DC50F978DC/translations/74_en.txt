　　While the Shogun was indisposed, an order was issued to suspend the attendance at court by various daimyo to inquire about his condition. However, still wishing to inquire about his condition, [Lord Tadamasa] went as far as Kanagawa station. There he learned that a new checkpoint had been established at Shinagawa with inspectors stationed there. From that station he took a boat to his Asakusa residence and immediately sent a messenger to the rōjū (senior councilors) reporting that "although attendance at court has been suspended due to the Shogun's indisposition, being unable to rest easy, he wished to inquire about his condition and thus proceeded to Edo."

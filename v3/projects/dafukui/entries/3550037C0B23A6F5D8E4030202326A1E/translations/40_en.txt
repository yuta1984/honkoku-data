　　　estates, fencing may be removed and houses left as desired
　
　　　If residences are damaged by fire and one must live in subsidiary houses
　　　during that time, temporary fencing around the house is acceptable, but when not residing there,
　　　leaving fencing in place is not permitted, as previously announced. However, having
　　　no fencing at all times would cause hardship. Moreover, the width of fencing would be difficult
　　　to determine suddenly during fires, so from now on, fencing should be made
　　　as narrow as possible around houses only. Details of how far
　　　around the house one wishes to fence should be reported to Lords Yokota Bicchū-no-kami, Shimada Sado-no-kami,

I have read your letter. Regarding the succession, through a messenger you presented one ceremonial sword,
　　　one horse, twenty bundles of formal paper, and also Magotarō's posthumous item,
　　　the sword Enju Kuniyoshi. There was an appropriate occasion and
　　　it was duly reported. The contents of both documents have been reviewed respectively.
　　　Though brief, I respectfully state this.

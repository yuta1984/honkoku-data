she died at four o'clock. She was my actual elder sister, but since I received the family headship as Hyōbu-taiyu, the relationship has become distant in terms of lineage. However, since she is actually of that relationship to me, I will observe half-reduced mourning. This is to notify you of the above. That is all.

1. On the same day, regarding the same matter and concerning the Zōjōji temple construction site, the following inquiry document was submitted to Senior Councillor Kuze Yamato-no-kami Shigeyuki:
"The mother of Matsudaira Dewa-no-kami had been suffering from illness, but treatment was unsuccessful and she died last night at four o'clock. She was actually my elder sister, but since I received the family headship as Hyōbu-taiyu, the relationship has become distant in terms of lineage. However, since she is actually of that relationship, I will observe half-reduced mourning. Accordingly, from today the 2nd until the 11th of the same month, for a period of ten days, I will be in mourning. I have notified the duty councillor of this matter. Regarding this, in the event of a fire breaking out near Zōjōji temple, should I refrain from going out to the construction site myself and instead send my retainers?"

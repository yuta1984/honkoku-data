Chief Retainer Koma Ise (Sumitaka) issued the following proclamation:
　　　Although it is not uncommon throughout history for samurai in the household and those below them to practice martial arts, since these are peaceful times, there may be a tendency toward negligence. Hereafter, without regard for others, one should practice with sincere dedication. Especially those who are direct retainers have leisure time, so they should concentrate on training. The devotion of the people should be considered first and foremost as service to their lord, as has been decreed. All should understand this meaning. The above.

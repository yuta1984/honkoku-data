1. When a foreign ship appears to be a warship, urgent reports should be sent immediately to Edo, particularly. If reports simply state "judged to be a warship," there will be inquiries asking what constitutes the basis for identifying it as a warship. Therefore, the circumstances that suggest it is a warship should be reported in detail first, and as observations continue, detailed reports should be made accordingly.

1. Even merchant vessels, if they are large ships, are said to be equipped with cannons, fire arrows, and such weapons depending on their origin. When they appear to be in mountainous areas far from human habitation, they sometimes fire guns for testing purposes. It is essential to listen carefully to those sounds. Also, if there have been minor conflicts in foreign countries, it has happened since ancient times that ships encounter storms and drift to Japan. If such a ship should arrive, they would want to create reasons for landing. Along with this, depending on circumstances, if unavoidable situations arise where contact cannot be avoided, there are cases where we might also engage and respond from our side privately. In any case, allowing them to land is said to be inadvisable.

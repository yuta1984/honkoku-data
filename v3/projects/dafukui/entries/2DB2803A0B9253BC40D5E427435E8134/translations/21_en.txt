First, the staple food is called "bread." The method of preparation is to make flour from wheat, knead it with pig fat, flavor it with chicken eggs and sugar, steam it like steamed buns, and eat it with milk three times a day - morning, noon, and evening. There are both refined and coarse methods of preparation. There is no miso or soy sauce at all. All meats and onions are seasoned with salt and eaten after being stir-fried with oil. At mealtime, they place something like a large desk, the entire household gathers around it, sits on chairs, and eats on top of the desk. Rice is traded from India, Qing China, and South America, and there are rice dealers, but it is said to be bland and not nourishing for people, so it is not used as a staple food. Sometimes it is made into gruel for sick people. Occasionally there are those who eat it out of curiosity. There are no straw bales; both wheat and rice are stored in metal-hooped barrels and measured with round measures.

Clothing is tailored from Western-style long sleeves and woolen cloth. There are no set colors - any color is used. Hair is done up in a knot and the ends are curled with heated metal, making it frizzy. This is said to be the custom in places in the West and East where tubular sleeves are worn. They weave "umbrella"-like objects. They wear hats brought from Luzon when going about. Women's hats have various beautiful decorations.

First, house construction is also Western-style, with all sliding doors made of "glass," and there are two, three, four, and five-story buildings. Unlike Japanese house construction, there are no curves, and toward the interior there are necessarily dark rooms. Walls are made of fired stone in red, white, and various colors. Roof tiles are also made from this. Lime-like materials are also visible. There are no tatami mats; even on wooden floors, woolen cloth is spread and people sit on chairs.

First, "Massachusetts Superior Lake" where I stayed is a port where ships from all nations converge, and it is extremely prosperous. There are pleasure quarters, entertainment districts, and such, making it truly bustling.

This place has become extremely prosperous in recent years, with pleasure quarters and constant arrivals of ships from all nations. The total revenue of the seven islands is approximately 120,000 pieces of gold, of which 60,000 pieces belong to the domain of the local ruler "King Kamehameha," while the other half of 60,000 pieces belongs to the territory of an magistrate-like person "Tafuta Rioji" who came from America. This person originally came to this island as a physician, saved many people, and naturally became like a magistrate, governing half of the native land. This place is an excellent strategic location in the middle of sea routes. If America were to take it, Britain would not consent; if Britain were to take it, Spain would not consent. Although it is a very small country, it cannot belong to any particular power, so the ship flags of this land use the combined marks of these three nations. When "King Kamehameha" travels, he has numerous attendants who clear the way ahead. All who encounter him remove their hats. His wife is a renowned beauty who wears brocade

clothing with gold and silver ornaments, and travels seated on horseback wearing a crown.

First, all seven islands are mountainous with sandy areas in between, but they do not produce the five grains, instead cultivating types of potatoes and onions. The revenue of 120,000 pieces of gold comes largely from port fees collected from the many international ships that call at port. Food and clothing are mostly traded from America. The staple food is something called "bread" made from wheat, and clothing is made in the American style with straight sleeves, tailored from woolen and cotton materials. They wear woven hats that come from Luzon when going about. Women style their hair like what is called "tennin mage" (celestial maiden topknot). Most houses are built in the American style with board roofs, thatched roofs, and stone roofs. Stone roofs are made of stones manufactured thin like tiles. Birds, animals, plants and trees are not particularly different from Japan. There is one type of large cotton tree. The climate is warm and temperate with no distinction between the four seasons.

"there must be no other reason" and such lyrics.

First, all ships follow European construction. Though the flags differ, the ships themselves are not very different. Large ships are all built over thirty ken in length, saying that if they can ride over three large waves in the ocean, there is no fear of capsizing.

First, for land transportation, both carts and horses are used. Therefore, major roads are built to detour around mountains rather than cross them. There is a steam vehicle called "railroad" which is the same as a steam engine. Regular ships have been prohibited in recent years, so I did not see any.

First, metal wires are strung high in exposed places, and letters are hung on these to automatically reach from station to station without troubling messengers. Distinctions are made between outgoing and incoming to prevent confusion along the way. I do not fully understand this mechanism, but I think it works like iron being drawn by a magnet.

First, regarding whale hunting in the ocean: they climb the mast to spot whales, and when found, they lower five or six small boats, strike many harpoons, take the ropes and chase the whale for many ri. When the whale weakens, they haul it up with the large ship's pulley, cut it into sections, extract oil in large cauldrons aboard the ship, and discard the meat, saying it is poisonous.

First, when whales approach the ship, they use drums to attract them and then catch them, or kill them with harpoons. At night, the entire ocean surface appears to be on fire every night. When sailing and fishing in this condition, it is not actually fire but all the light from sea foam. Additionally, fire sometimes flies to the mast. This too is just atmospheric phenomena that appears before wind and rain.

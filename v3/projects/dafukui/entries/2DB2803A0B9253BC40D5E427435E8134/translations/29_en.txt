American letters, twenty-six (note: there are separate numerical characters, same as European letters)

Wearing a short jacket on top, trousers below, all with tight socks binding the feet, with woolen garments added over the body, wearing felt hats, and leather shoes. One can tell these are Westerners. There was a castaway who returned from America, and it became the talk of the town for a time, with onlookers gathering like a wall. I happened to be ill and could not see him, but Yoshida Shiei drew a picture and sent it to me. The appearance of the clothing was roughly like this.

I consider that although the West and America are separated by east and west on the globe, their customs and practices are roughly the same. Could this be because the American lands are divided and governed by Western people?

Shiei also recorded the facts of the drifting and sojourn in sequence, compiling them into a small booklet. It is clear and concise, and can be understood at a glance. I was asked for a preface.

I once heard that in the South Seas there are magnetic reefs. When ships approach them, all the iron nails are drawn out by attraction and instantly shattered to pieces. This is also recorded in books. Now navigation expands daily, and one can travel everywhere on the entire globe, but the vast ocean beneath the South Pole seems immeasurable. Can what the castaway tells us really be trusted?

Our country is distant and has no one who studies Western books, but this castaway has already learned the American language and mastered their writing, enabling him to understand their circumstances in detail and supplement his own deficiencies. The writing of this book is not merely strange tales.

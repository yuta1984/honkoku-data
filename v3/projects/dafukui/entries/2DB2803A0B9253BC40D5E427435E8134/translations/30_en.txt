American Bamboo Branch Poems

The sound of pestles pounding grain is busy in autumn, snow melts in every village and wheat appears at market. The morning paper still carries many sentimental thoughts—cease asking for whom one adorns oneself beautifully.

The man does not catch loach in the great ocean; the gold from trade lies in Manchuria. Alone guarding chastity, sleeping and waking again, three autumns have already passed within the glass screen.

The pleasure quarters by the harbor connect along the water; today welcoming English ships, yesterday Dutch vessels. Fine wine for intoxication is still bearable to loathe—why do beautiful lips blow opium smoke?

The great road is level—why despise the winding path? Following mountains and water to reach the royal capital. The king's progress forms no procession—wearing a hat, straddling a saddle, accompanied by just one servant.

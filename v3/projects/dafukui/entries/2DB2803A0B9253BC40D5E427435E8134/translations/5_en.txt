someone with what looked like eyes and teeth attached to the bottom of a pot came and said something while trying to
pull Denzō out. He was terrified and trembling when a white-skinned
foreigner gestured for the other three to also board the boat, so following this, they
boarded the boat. Jūsuke was carried onto the boat by that dark-skinned person.
Then both boats rowed to the large ship and they boarded it. It was a ship about thirty ken long,
six ken wide with three masts, carrying about thirty foreigners.
They received extremely courteous treatment, each receiving medicine and
a tunic-style garment, and various care. That person again
gestured as if asking whether anything had been left behind on the island,
so they indicated by gestures that clothing had been left behind. Again a small boat was lowered
with the dark-skinned person aboard, who rowed to the island to retrieve the clothing. For about three days
they received small amounts of baked potatoes, dried pork, and such, but when they tried to eat much,

they were greatly restrained. They later learned this was done because starving people who suddenly eat large amounts
can die instantly. Initially,
when the small boat rowed to the island, they did not know from the start that there were castaways there;
they had come fishing for shore fish when they spotted human figures and rescued them. Now, this ship was
a whaling vessel from the North American country called "Massachusetts," with a ship owner named "Whit-
field." From there they hunted whales in various places, caught fifteen large whales,
extracted their oil, and discarded the meat into the sea. At the end of November they reached port at "Honolulu" on the island of "Oahu" in the "Sandwich"
Islands. This port was
where ships from all nations gathered, and there was a person like a magistrate
from North America called a "Governor," so "Whitfield" made a request to this person,
landed the five men including Denzō, brought a map and repeatedly asked
"Is it this one or that one?" But since all five were unfamiliar with maps, they could not understand at all.

When they spoke together, they immediately met and could understand each other well. This person was the captain of a mandarin orange ship called Tenjumaru from Hidaka in Kii Province, Japan, named Torakichi. With thirteen people aboard, they had departed from Edo but were cast adrift by wind and waves and rescued by this ship. Of these thirteen people, eight were at a Russian port called "Setahorashike," with only five remaining together. He made a promise with these five to return to Japan together, but when the appointed time came, Toraemon changed his mind and said he wanted to stay there a while longer. Despite various attempts at persuasion, perhaps because he had been discouraged by Denzo's earlier unsuccessful attempt to reach Japan, he absolutely refused to agree. Leaving this unreasonable person behind, Manjiro requested employment on an American whaling ship, and a total of nine people boarded. However, disagreements arose between Manjiro and the people on the ship, so he asked the ship's master to somehow send the five men from Kishu to Japan, while Manjiro, Denzo, and

Goemon—the three of them—went ashore. During this time, Denzo met a Japanese man named Zensuke at "Hanarono" port. This person had drifted from a Harima Hyogo ship and been cared for by a French ship. He was on his way back to Japan on that same vessel, wearing light green woolen clothing with the insignia of a noble called "Kaku" and a hat with gold crests. Wanting to return to Japan together, they consulted with "Uwaho" officials and sent a written request to the ship. The reply from the ship to the officials stated that while this Zensuke would be sent back as ordered by his home country's officials, several other companions of Zensuke remained in their home country, and it would be difficult to take on more Japanese people at this time. So regrettably, they had to part ways with Zensuke empty-handed. Zensuke has now already returned to Japan and is under the patronage of the Lord of Kishu, according to what Torakichi told them. Soon after the three went ashore, a ship master named "Fitscaha" from a place called "Mean" in North America also entered port for trade

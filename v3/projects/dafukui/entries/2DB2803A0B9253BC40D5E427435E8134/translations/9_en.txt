They went and met with Toraemon, made promises for their return to Japan, and bade farewell to their
close acquaintances, shedding tears as they parted. From that "Ricord" they received various
farewell gifts and boarded the ship. "Fichsel" earnestly entrusted the brothers to "Captain Cofman"
and said his farewells. Toraemon had been arranged to board the ship beforehand through "Fi-
chsel's" consideration, but
suddenly changed his mind, saying "Everyone, I want to stay here a little longer. Also, there seems to be
a malicious person on the ship," and went ashore again. We later heard that this ship arrived at some country
and was wrecked. Before long, "Captain Cofman"
set sail and began whaling around the islands directly under the sun,
and around March of the following year came near Hachijojima of Japan, but the wind was bad and
they could not land properly. Sailing east to near a certain country, "Captain
Cofman" said, "This is a territory under Japan's control called 'Matsumae.'

You should return from here," and anchored the ship at a north-facing shore.
At first it appeared that beacon fires were lit and the shore was being guarded, but after the ship arrived,
not a single person could be seen. "Captain Cofman" accompanied the brothers ashore and
looked around everywhere, finding two small huts, but no people were
living there. Having no choice, he told them "You two should return from here,"
but "Captain Cofman" would not agree, saying "It is not my intention to abandon you in a place with no people.
There will be other opportunities, so for now
please board the ship again." Following his wishes, they boarded again, sailed east,
and whaled in various places. For about
forty days they saw no sunlight, then sailed south, returning to "Oahu" around October.
"Captain Cofman" also seemed to feel sorry for them, saying "When there is another good
opportunity I will send you," and they parted as the brothers went ashore.

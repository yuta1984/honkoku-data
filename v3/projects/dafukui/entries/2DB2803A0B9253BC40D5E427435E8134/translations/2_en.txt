At a place called Dondo off the coast of Yotsu in the Satoshimo area, they fished for sea bass using
longlines, but caught nothing. They then dropped anchor at a place called Hachijū Cape
in the lower area and spent the night there. The next day, the 6th, they fished off
Saga but again caught nothing, so they went to a place called Ida no Shirahama
and spent the night there. Around dawn on the 7th, about fourteen or fifteen ri

preparing so they wouldn't be overturned, and drifted at the mercy of the wind. They could see
the mountains of the mainland, but could not reach them, and drifted helplessly until even the mountains
became invisible. On the 9th day, their prepared rice ran out, and they ate the fish they had
caught and stored to stave off hunger. On the 10th day, it rained

1. Kyōhō 3 (1718), Year of the Dog, 5th month, 23rd day, at Lord Ise's residence, as follows:
　　　　Official notice: Memorandum to be communicated to Honda Ōkura's senior retainers
　In recent years since the succession, from Magoarō's time, the administration of various matters at Fuchū has differed from the administration at Fukui, causing His Lordship suspicion in various matters. If Magoarō were alive, His Lordship's thoughts could be heard, but since he has died, this is not possible. Since Fuchū has been entrusted [to your family] for generations, there may be a family tradition of administration, but henceforth, since Ōkura is young, he should consider Fukui's administration and apply careful attention to all matters. If there are again matters of suspicion, the senior retainers will be considered at fault, so at that time punishment will certainly be ordered. Always be vigilant and discuss matters in detail before implementation. End. 5th month　　In addition, a separate document recording what Lord Ise communicated orally has been placed in the official box.

Since he is from Ōmura in Uemon's fief and is not currently employed, and since he falls under Hikosaka Matabyōe's jurisdiction, Ichiemon's case should be reported to the intermediary officials and banishment from thirteen ri around the castle town should be ordered. He said he would inform Matabyōe of this matter and have group members escort him for banishment even today. Accordingly, this was immediately communicated to Matabyōe.

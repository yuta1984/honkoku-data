1. Regarding the matter of ordering exile for hereditary retainers who commit wrongdoing, from senior councillors down to middle-ranking retainers, at the discretion of their masters:
　For exile from the domain, there shall be notification to the inspector (metsuke), and handling shall occur after receiving a response from the inspector. Apart from the above, even for ten-ri exile, it can be settled at the master's discretion. Regarding ordering exile for those who employ townspeople and rural folk for one season or half a season, as has been the practice, even for exile from the castle town, arrangements shall be made after receiving a response from the inspector.
　Apart from the above, severe punishments shall follow the official regulations (goshikimoku).
　Kaei 5 (1852), Year of the Rat, 7th month, 26th day: communicated from monthly duty officer Matsunami Jinzaemon to duty officer Matsudaira Shume, to be decided after deliberation.

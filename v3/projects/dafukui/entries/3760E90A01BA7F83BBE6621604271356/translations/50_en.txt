Punishments During Absence in Edo

1. When those absent in Edo are ordered to undergo musoku (無息) punishment, relatives may request and conduct passage.
   However, when the master is present and retainers are punished with musoku, gates are not even half-closed, but when absent in Edo, the above procedures apply.

1. In the 4th month of Hōreki 1st year (Year of the Sheep), Shimazu Katsuzaemon was relieved of his duties and practiced restraint. His son Sanpei returned from Edo and arrived at Katsuzaemon's place of restraint. He immediately submitted a petition for restraint and was ordered to do as petitioned.
   However, since he had been granted leave for three years and returned with luggage, it was not possible to sort it out, causing inconvenience to others. Upon petition by relatives, the luggage was taken by relatives and distributed to the respective parties. This matter remained pending for some time.

According to the procedure of sending investigators, foot inspectors and their group members were dispatched to examine the case, and the written report was brought to Kawasaki Saburōsuke's residence. After receiving it and immediately consulting with the senior councilors, they ordered the corpse to be disposed of, so this was communicated to Tōshichi who had it disposed of.

1. Bunsei 13 (1830), Year of the Tiger, 3rd month, 18th day: Koma Mokku's retainer Imasuke, who had been taken to Edo, had some improper conduct in Edo and was sent back to the domain. When he arrived yesterday, a messenger reported that Imasuke was given dismissal and ordered not to enter his home village of Nishifukuro. This was also communicated to the district magistrate. However, regarding matters of village expulsion, the district office had no such procedures, and they inquired of the inspector whether it would be acceptable to handle this merely through notification from the other party. Upon further investigation, it was determined that a communication from the master alone would be insufficient grounds, so the matter was consulted with the senior councilors. The senior councilors stated that since this servant had improper conduct, they wished to dismiss him and banish him from the castle town and his home village, and if this were communicated through a written petition, the inspector would consult with the senior councilors and give instructions to proceed as deemed appropriate. After calling Mokku's retainer and instructing him to handle the matter as deemed fit, the current master should consult with the district magistrate about the nature of the offense, and the magistrate would order appropriate measures to be taken as requested. The district office would then communicate this to the village officials and Imasuke. Duty officer: Koma Taitō's group, monthly duty officer Ogino Nabehachirō. Future cases should follow this same procedure, with the master submitting a petition through the inspector to the senior councilors.

However, when the district office completes its instructions, this should be reported to the inspector.

　　　　Oral statement record
My retainer Iwai Ichinosuke committed misconduct, so I have ordered him to leave the domain. I hereby report this matter. End.
　　　　　7th month, last day　　　Ariga Naiki's messenger　Terasaki Kyūuemon

Upon hearing this report, I investigated precedents and found that during the Hōreki era, when Sakai Geki wished to banish his retainer Ōkubo Kanzaemon, he communicated this to the duty officer through an inspector before the banishment was ordered. I further inquired of the messenger whether this report was made after proper investigation, but he replied that no thorough investigation had been conducted. Since today's report comes after the handling has been completed, I understand that according to precedent, after making a communication, one should consult with the duty officer and respond according to their instructions. If there are matters to communicate, they can be addressed later, so please keep this in mind. Regarding the report, I will first acknowledge it and will communicate this to Lord Naiki. When this was conveyed, again...

Consult and receive instructions before dispatching representatives.
　1. When there are official duties, one should visit after completing the official duties.
　　　However, if the official duties extend past seven o'clock, it is acceptable to send a representative. For those serving all-day duty shifts, it is acceptable to send representatives. When there are official duties or urgent illness, the circumstances should be reported to the inspector by letter.

　The above matters were further communicated on December 27th, Tenpō 2nd year [inserted] December 14th regarding Mito Tajima, Mizuno Tōbei, Nara Sukeemon, his son Dentarō, second son Takekichi, etc. - written instructions for understanding by those serving as visitors when domain retainers are under discretionary confinement.

1. In July, Bunsei 13th year, when Akashi Nuinodono was ordered house confinement, Honda Chikugo's petition to serve as visitor was approved as requested, and this was to be communicated by letter, but the letter did not arrive. When Hahabe Sama was under punishment and Ashida Zusho served as visitor, a letter did arrive, so afterwards Chikugo's messenger was told to handle it according to the letter's intent. This time was acceptable, but hereafter it should be by letter.

　However, notifications by letter vary considerably. In external high-ranking cases, they are mostly oral records noting whose messenger it is, without addressee names. This is how it should be understood.

　1. House confinement involves cutting off entry and exit; departures are reported through oral messengers.
　　To Akashi Nuinodono's residence: one retainer, one stipend-rank person, one foot soldier, and servants will be dispatched, so we report this. Above
　　　Date　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Honda Chikugo's messenger

1. On August 29th, Tenpō 5th year, visitor Mizutani Oribe for Minakawa Kunaino, visitor Sasaharu Gonemon for Sano Kotarō, visitor Inagaki Bunko for Nakagawa Rokuzaemon - when these individuals were approved as visitors as requested, they reported their immediate departure through oral messengers. However, according to precedent, in December Tenpō 2nd year, Tominaga Enjirō served as visitor for Mito Tajima, and in Tenpō 3rd year, Mizutani Oribe served as visitor for Ōta Miya - both were told to report by letter and did so accordingly. This time they should also have been told to report by letter, but since it was very late at night, tonight's matter was handled as communication by letter. On September 1st at the castle, this was communicated to Sasaharu Gonemon, and for this pardon they should report by letter. Hereafter, such reports should always be by letter, both before and after. This was also communicated to fellow council members for their prior understanding.

　However, initially there are letters of notification, daily there are notifications through oral record messengers, and at the time of pardon there are again letters of notification.

1. At the same time, Group Leader Murakami Okinosuke inquired: when a Group Leader petitions for visitation rights to family members under discretionary confinement, during domain residence there are full-day attendances, and moreover on attendance days if there are naturally fires in the castle town, one must go to the castle. In such cases, would it be acceptable to send retainers as representatives? When consulting with colleagues, for council member status, retainers can be reported here and sent as representatives in such circumstances, but for external guards there should be no hereditary retainers, so representatives would not be possible. When further inquiring with Duty Officer Matsudaira Shume, he confirmed that retainer representatives are not permitted, but in such unavoidable circumstances, sons as representatives would be acceptable. This was communicated to Okinosuke.

　However, for external guard visitations, the reporting method here is the same as the council precedent in the previous clause. In November, Kōka 3rd year, when Sengoku Man'emon was under discretionary confinement, visitor Murakami Tarōichi's reporting method to Monthly Officer Senbon Tōzaemon was thus.

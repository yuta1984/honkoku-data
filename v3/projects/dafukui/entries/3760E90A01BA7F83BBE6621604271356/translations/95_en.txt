[The matter] is not known. Therefore, by establishing the number of pawnshops, having them display identifying marks, and imposing a small operational tax, and by designating licensed pawnshops, lost items might also be identified. For those designated licensed pawnshops, when there are guarantors and verbal agreements with witnesses, even if stolen goods are involved, should we order buyback with the original money from the theft victim as in the past? Of course, if guarantors fail to respond and do not conform to established law, items should be confiscated and punishment imposed. Both guarantors and intermediaries should be fined according to their status and punished accordingly.

For those other than the designated pawnshops who do not pay the operational tax and secretly accept pawned items, the pawnshops' association should be ordered to investigate. If such persons are found to have accepted stolen goods, the items should be confiscated without question, fines imposed, and if they later apply to become pawnshops, they should be allowed to join the association through negotiation with the pawnshops, which should not hinder commerce. Would stolen goods then flow more to pawnshops? If stolen goods are uniformly confiscated according to regular regulations without discrimination, pawnshops would primarily become constrained, and their careful practices would naturally shift toward dealings with other domains and provinces. Therefore, as stated above, when pawned items and purchases handled by designated pawnshops under previous laws are determined to be stolen goods, they should be bought back by theft victims with the original money. If those other than designated pawnshops secretly accept pawned items, these should be confiscated. By distinguishing between pawnshops that pay operational taxes and those who secretly handle pawned items, control measures can be implemented, and moreover, the handling of lost items inquiries should improve. Generally, pawned items are the primary means of circulating gold and silver for merchants, but because of considerate handling for people, most use intermediaries so that both depositors and pawnshops maintain stable commercial relationships. Many pawned items that affect daily necessities are handled by servants, maids, and widows who are relied upon for modest assistance or small amounts of coins for transactions. Since this constitutes one means of livelihood for such humble people, if operations become uniformly constrained and impractical, dealings would naturally shift toward other domains and provinces. With this private understanding, I respectfully submit the above matters for consideration.

October 5th　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Kobayashi Matauemon

District annotation in red: With the above document, Town Magistrate Kobayashi Matauemon made this inquiry on October 5th. On November 27th, approval was given as requested, and notification was sent to the district office. When the three districts held joint deliberations, the district office found that the above arrangements would cause difficulties and were hard to implement, so they declined and returned the original document to Matauemon.

Traditional regulations of the town office as follows:

1. When a person with established residence commits theft, is arrested and confesses under investigation, punishment should be imposed as prescribed, and house, property, warehouses, and all tools should be confiscated. Money should be paid to pawnshops and stolen goods confiscated. For shortfalls from house and property confiscation, guarantors should compensate.
However, if they are household members, even if the master was unaware, compensation should be made to the limit of their person. For any shortage, residents should also compensate.

Bunsei 4, 4th month of the Snake year, District Magistrate correspondence document as follows:

From the Shogunal Regulations of the Kanpō era, within the section on punishment for those who accept stolen goods as pawns or purchase them {{Note: However, the wording in the household regulations of the An'ei era is substantially similar}}

1. When stolen goods are unknowingly accepted with guarantors as is customary for pawning, and investigation determines the person was unaware they were stolen goods, the guarantor should compensate with the original money, the pawned item should be retrieved and returned to the theft victim.
However, if the guarantor is also punished and cannot pay the required money, the pawnshop should bear the loss. If there are no guarantors or the pawning was done carelessly, the pawnshop should bear the loss and additionally be punished.

In this proviso section, even when stolen goods investigation concludes and the guarantor is also to be punished, the guarantor should pay what they can according to their means. Just because punishment is decided does not mean money need not be paid - this would be untenable, which is quite reasonable, so certainly...

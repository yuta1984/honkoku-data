On the 19th day of the fifth month of the same 5th year, Year of the Monkey [Genbun 5, 1740], when Yagishita Rihei was ordered into house confinement, it was directed that one group member be stationed near Rihei's residence, and when he returned after completing his business, one group member was posted as a lookout.

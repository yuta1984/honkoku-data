tives, and furthermore, it would be appropriate to inform various unit commanders and others who should be aware of this.

Regarding the above matter, it was also communicated to unit commanders through Shichitayū when convenient. Consequently, hereafter officials, pages, attendants, and others in daily intensive service positions are exceptional cases, but all others should serve as visitors.

△1. On December 11th, Bunsei 12th year, Senior Advance Guard Commander Kasuya Hikotayū, who was serving as visitor for Hanii Chūan's house confinement, reported that today there were personnel changes among colleagues, many official duties for his unit, making visitation difficult, and moreover he had overnight guard duty tonight. Therefore he requested to send his son as representative. When Monthly Duty Officer Ōida Kiuchi inquired with the Duty Officer, he was told that since today's matter was urgent, the inspector should acknowledge it. Hereafter, when urgent official duties make visitation difficult, the inspector should acknowledge it. During years of domain residence when Senior Advance Guard Commanders have day and night duty shifts, if reported to the inspector, acknowledgment should be given, according to instructions from Duty Officer Koma Tatewaki.

　However, the precedent for this was in previous years when Tōgō Saburōemon was Senior Advance Guard Commander visiting Hosoi Gentoku, and also when Suzuki Matazaemon visited during Murata Jūtayū's discretionary confinement. Both were Senior Advance Guard Commanders who sent sons as representatives, so this became possible this time as well. However, when ill, sons cannot serve as representatives.

1. Having low-ranking officials serve as visitors for retainers.

　1. In Bunsei 12th year, when Okajima Taki was under house confinement, fellow clansman Okajima Seinosuke, a low-ranking official, served as visitor. Therefore his supervising head petitioned the magistrate. The magistrate then sent daily reports to the inspector through messengers, and Seinosuke conducted visits.

△1. In April, Bunsei 6th year, when Mizuno Hikotō was ordered house confinement, the visitor changed and Junior External Guard Ariga Sōzaemon petitioned and served as visitor. However, since Sōzaemon had chronic pain and could not rush to Hikotō's residence in emergencies, this was reported to the Senior Councilors.

At that time, it was acceptable for sons to go and arrive later, but normally sending sons was not permitted, as communicated by Duty Officer Matsudaira Shume. Sōzaemon also reported this matter to the Monthly Duty Officer, as heard from Imadate Gorōtayū.

1. On March 16th, Bunsei 13th year, when Mabuchi Genryū was under discretionary confinement, visitor Hirano Gisai petitioned and went. Gisai reported to Monthly Duty Officer Ogino Nabehachirō that regarding physicians, sons had previously served as visitors when ill, so he wished to send his son when ill for this case as well. This was acknowledged, but since last year when Senior Advance Guard Commander Kasuya Hikotayū served as visitor for Hanii Chūan, it was said that sons as representatives were not permitted. After further consultation among colleagues, if unable to visit due to illness, another person should be petitioned, and sons as representatives would no longer be permitted. This was replied based on the aforementioned precedent.

1. On June 7th, Bunsei 13th year, when those assisting with construction at the Main Castle were granted audience, Senior Guard Commander Ōta Miya went out. At this time, since Hahabe Minato was under punishment and Miya was visiting, but due to going to the Main Castle he could not visit Minato's residence, he requested to send a representative. Since this was unavoidable, instructions were given to send a representative for that day. Subsequently, he frequently sent representatives for stomach pain and official duties. When Ogino Nabehachirō inquired with Duty Officer Koma Tatewaki, he was told that representatives could be sent when unavoidably pressed and unable to go personally, or for sudden stomach pain. Even for official duties, if unable to attend due to duties known from the previous day, another person should be petitioned for visitation. However, if unavoidably impossible, representatives could be sent. When Nabehachirō communicated this to Miya, he replied that this would disrupt the protocols for council member status, making it difficult. Nabehachirō reported this to the Senior Councilors, and on the 16th of the same month, Tatewaki communicated the following understanding:

　1. When visitors are seriously ill and unable to go, and there is no time to petition for a replacement, representatives may be sent due to the urgency.

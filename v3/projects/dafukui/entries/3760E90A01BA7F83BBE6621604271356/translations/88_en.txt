1. Kyōhō 19 (1734), Year of the Tiger, 12th month, 12th day: Honda Kuranosuke's retainer Yamai Tadayoshi killed a Kanazawa messenger at Yanagihara on the 2nd day of this month. Orders were issued from Sakai Genba and Okabe Sazen that seppuku should be ordered ■■■. This official letter was delivered by Sazen after summoning the caretaker. However, regarding Honda Nuinodono's matter, orders were issued that Kuranosuke's caretaker should be summoned to be informed of the details. On the 19th of the same month, Tadayoshi was ordered to commit seppuku at Fuchū. On the following 20th day, this was communicated to duty officer Sazen through Kuranosuke's messenger, so orders were issued that Ōmiya Hikoemon should send an express message to the Kanazawa town magistrate. At that time, regarding tea master Kojima Ryōho's matter in connection with Tadayoshi's case, orders were issued that this was not a matter of strict self-restraint, but that he should close his gate and remain at home, and that matters such as passage were not necessary.

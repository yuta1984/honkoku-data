On Kyōhō 15 (Year of the Dog), December 15, regarding improper conduct concerning rice stipend certificates of Kawase Banshichi of side attendant Moro Taemon's group, the senior retainers instructed the inspectors to conduct an examination at Taemon's residence. Taemon conducted several examinations and submitted several written statements, but with no repeated changes, Taemon found it troublesome and requested through his colleague Ihara Jōsuke that the examination be conducted by higher authorities. On the 25th of the same month, it was ordered that the examination be conducted at town magistrate Ōmiya Hikoemon's residence with one magistrate and one inspector each in attendance. Based on this, it was handled after inquiring whether Banshichi should have his head half-shaved according to precedent and be handed over to Hikoemon's office with Taemon's group members accompanying him.

On the 17th year (Year of the Rat), December 26, to senior officer Oguri Kyūemon: Regarding stolen goods at Ōta Saburōbei's residence, retainer Kansuke and townsman Gonbei were suspicious, so it was requested on November 14 that they be taken up for deliberation by higher authorities. This matter also has continuous records. Since this had been requested previously, deliberation was ordered and there were repeated torture sessions, but they claimed not to know about the stolen goods. However, Kansuke was ordered not to go within three ri and four chō of the castle town, as instructed to Ōmiya Hikoemon. Regarding Gonbei, since there were no particular issues at present, it was announced that he should be released from prison. Regarding this, Saburōbei had requested higher authorities to investigate a matter for which he had no evidence, and the strong deliberations ordered as mentioned above were both conducted with poor investigation and reported carelessly, resulting in an improper situation that displeased [the authorities]. This was to be conveyed to Saburōbei.
Regarding the matter of Saburōbei's restraint, if inquired about, the private intention was conveyed to Kyūemon that he need not impose self-restraint but should remain subdued. However, since there was no reprimand in the aforementioned instructions and he thought the poor investigation and impropriety regarding Kansuke's matter was unavoidable, Saburōbei said he would not request restraint. Although Kyūemon handled this matter step by step, Saburōbei would not agree, and when this was reported to the senior retainers, they said Saburōbei's attitude was extremely unreasonable, so according to Nuinodono's instructions, he was told to request restraint, and he did so. Furthermore, Kyūemon reported the step-by-step proceedings to the inspectors, with detailed records available. Regarding this examination, two foot inspectors were assigned, but on the 26th, they were dismissed after consultation with the senior retainers.

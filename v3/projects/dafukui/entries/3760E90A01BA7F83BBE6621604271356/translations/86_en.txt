Later, the stipend recipient Mori Genzō came and reported that this case was handled following the precedent of the dismissal of Honda Chikugo's retainer on the 6th day of the 5th month of Bunka 10 (1813), Year of the Rooster. When we investigated this matter, there was no discrepancy with the stated facts, but since Chikugo held the position of senior councilor and was also serving in an official capacity at that time, this was a special case. We further consulted with our colleagues and inquired with Koma Mokku, examining precedent documents. The senior councilors deliberated and stated that henceforth, following the precedent of Sakai Geki's case during the Hōreki era, such matters should be handled after consultation with the senior councilors. Therefore, in this case as well, we privately consulted with Lord Naiki and handled the matter through proper consultation procedures. The oral statement record is as follows:
　My retainer Iwai Ichinosuke has committed misconduct, and I wish to order him to leave the domain. Please handle this appropriately. End.
This procedure should be followed henceforth.
○ To be entered on the front

1. Tenpō 2 (1831), Year of the Rabbit, 12th month, 22nd day: Sakai Yosazaemon's {{This time serving as duty officer}} hereditary retainer Katō Manpei committed misconduct and was ordered to leave the domain. Accordingly, this should have been reported through a messenger, but when Ogino Nabehachirō attended the official session, Yosazaemon's side stated they would report directly. They further inquired whether, since this was domain banishment, it definitely required reporting, but since it was domain departure rather than banishment, perhaps reporting was unnecessary. If reporting was still required, they requested appropriate handling. After consultation among colleagues, it was determined that reporting was indeed necessary, so it was handled accordingly, and the matter was later communicated to the previous month's duty officer Matsudaira Shume.

1. Tenpō 6 (1835), Year of the Sheep, 12th month: Regarding punishments imposed on domain retainers' servants, for light punishments up to house arrest, the master need not submit a petition of self-restraint. However, for severe punishments such as execution or banishment, a petition of self-restraint should be submitted according to regulations. This was communicated by the senior councilors through the inner secretary Aoki Yoichiemon. Henceforth, when inquiries are made, the response should be that no petition is necessary.
　Note: This was decided when Mouke Denzaburō's retainer Sakai ■emon was sentenced to house arrest on the 29th day of the 11th month. When Denzaburō consulted privately with Yokota Sakutayū about submitting a petition, the matter was referred to the senior councilors, who instructed that this procedure should be followed henceforth.

1. Tenpō 12 (1841), Year of the Ox, 8th month, 20th day: Oguri Sukeshichi's servant Kihachi discharged a large amount of roof debris into the clean water. When the patrol group discovered this and reported it to the water supply official Ogino Nabehachirō, a notice had just been issued, but since the instruction to the servant was inadequate, Sukeshichi submitted a petition of self-restraint. The servant was sentenced to house arrest by Sukeshichi.
　Note: From this point forward, it was decided on the 23rd day of the same month that the master need not submit petitions.

1. Kōka 2 (1845), Year of the Snake, 5th month, 20th day: There were reports of misconduct among Sugita Gorobyōe's retainers, including representatives and pages in the attendant quarters. Most were sentenced to house arrest. Accordingly, Gorobyōe fearfully submitted a petition of self-restraint, but was told this was unnecessary.

1. Kōka 3 (1846), Year of the Horse, 6th month, 11th day: Sakai Geki submitted the following report to monthly duty officer Yamamoto Genzaemon:
　　　　Oral statement record
　My servant Isonai from Kaihatsu Village has committed misconduct, so I wish to dismiss him and banish him from the castle town and his home village. Please handle this appropriately. End.　6th month　　Sakai Geki
When Genzaemon communicated this to the duty officer, Koma Taitō's office responded that it should be handled as requested, so this was communicated to Geki. At that time, Geki reported the handling to district magistrate Senbon Tōzaemon, who immediately handled the matter and communicated this to his colleague on monthly duty. The district magistrate also communicated with Geki's side. Note: There is a precedent from Bunsei 13 (1830), Year of the Tiger, 3rd month, 18th day, regarding the banishment of Koma Mokku's servant Imasuke.

1. Kyōwa 2 (1802), Year of the Dog, 11th month, 7th day: Reports were heard of improper conduct in Edo by Kōzuki Kyūemon's retainer Kyūsuke and Kaga Jirōemon's retainer Izō. The senior councilors ordered them to be placed under house arrest, and this was communicated to both men by letter. Note: They were pardoned on the 10th day and this was communicated by letter.

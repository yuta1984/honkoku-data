[Red notation] Mark on front ○ For those under house arrest with illness or unavoidable circumstances, petitions will be accepted as internal policy, as follows:

1. In Tenpō 5 (1834), year of the horse, the Senior Councilors communicated: Until now, when pardons were announced for those under house arrest, they would petition for forgiveness, and after examination, pardons were granted progressively. Extraordinary pardon petitions became difficult to submit. However, when there are no occasions for pardons through celebrations or memorial services for several years, while this may be called personal misfortune, when compared to those who received pardons quickly through frequent amnesty opportunities, this might also correspond to lack of compassion. They requested further deliberation, so the following inquiry was submitted:
   For those sentenced to house arrest whose years have passed and who petition for extraordinary pardon due to illness or unavoidable circumstances, will petitions be
   accepted and deliberated upon?
   However, when such petitions are made, regarding forgiveness of punishments, deliberation should occur regardless of years served, based on severity of crime and quality of restraint.
   Family meeting permissions and complete pardons should also depend on misconduct patterns. Naturally, petitions made after pardons are announced should be deliberated as before.
   When this inquiry was made in the same 7th month, it was approved on the 13th day, and Okabe Sazen communicated that henceforth such matters should be handled as internal policy among colleagues.

1. Regarding petitions when pardons are announced, and extraordinary pardon petitions due to unavoidable circumstances - for both cases, when restraint behavior is good and there are no problematic issues, henceforth even for first-time petitioners, those with five years or more will receive complete pardons, while those with up to four years will be granted family meetings if it is their first petition, as internal policy.
   However, depending on the nature of crimes and quality of restraint, examination and deliberation will occur on each occasion.
   A copy of the internal correspondence among colleagues regarding this matter is as follows:

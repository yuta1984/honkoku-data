1. Regarding wives of those punished being kept at their family homes for self-restraint

Memorandum of oral statement:
My cousin so-and-so received punishment today, for which we are deeply sorry. His wife is the daughter of so-and-so, but when she went for year-end greetings last winter, she became ill and is still not well, unable even to ride in a palanquin. Therefore, it is difficult to bring her back. Consequently, we wish to have her strictly observe self-restraint at so-and-so's place and leave her there as requested. So-and-so conveyed this message. As this concerns a matter during the period of self-restraint, I humbly make this request. Such is the gist, etc.

1. On July 29th, Bunsei 3 (1820), year of the dragon, at the council hall, regarding unmarried sons, uncles, nephews, younger brothers, etc. of samurai retainers who received punishment, during their period of restraint, the front gates or entrances were kept half-closed. However, following deliberations, it was decided that front gates should be opened, but entrances and vestibules should be kept closed, and where there are no gates, entrances should be kept half-closed. Monthly duty officer: Hasegawa Buuemon

However, while this was the rule, on June 25th, Bunsei 4 (1821), year of the snake, when Yasumoto Sajibyōe's son Shinsuke was ordered self-restraint, monthly duty officer Hasebe Kouemon instructed that the gate be kept half-closed.

1. On October 11th, Bunsei 12 (1829), year of the ox, Maeda Hikojirō's son Shinshirō was ordered self-restraint, and Hikojirō was also ordered to refrain after consultation. During this period of restraint, the gate was kept half-closed, but after Hikojirō's restraint was lifted, it was unnecessary to keep the gate half-closed even during his son's self-restraint period, as conveyed by Koma Taitō when monthly duty officer Ōida Kinai consulted him.

However, until now, even when parents were not ordered restraint, gates were kept half-closed during sons' self-restraint as customary practice. But among the foot soldiers' inspectors (otsuji metsuke) who understood this, some kept gates open, creating inconsistency. Therefore, after deliberation among colleagues and consultation, it was newly decreed that for punishment of sons only, gates need not be kept half-closed. This matter was also communicated to the group leaders of the foot soldiers' inspectors. The same applies even when sons are ordered house arrest or confinement.

Note: When parents are absent in Edo and unmarried sons receive punishment, since there is foot traffic, this is a separate matter.

1. On June 9th, Bunka 4 (1807), year of the rabbit, during a meeting of Senior Councilors, there was deliberation that regarding those receiving punishment and those being disciplined, the domain had previously sometimes clearly stated their crimes when issuing punishments, but at some point this practice ceased, with statements like "improper matters are heard" or "matters not reaching attention" being issued instead. However, regarding accomplices in the recent counterfeit document case and those who assaulted Saitō Chōtarō in the development village area, each official stated that their crimes should be clearly stated in the criminal record when punishment is issued. Since this differs from recent practice, after thorough deliberation, if it is deemed appropriate to continue this practice hereafter, indeed following what was communicated this time, if extended to the lower ranks, it would serve as a deterrent and make crimes and punishments clear for future reference when examining official records, which would be beneficial. However, it would be inappropriate to do this only once and then cease again, so thorough deliberation was requested. In response, everyone answered that if this practice continues hereafter, it would provide good discipline and make records useful for reference.

However, for townspeople and residents or minor stipend recipients who are investigated by their subordinates and submit written confessions, and even without such documents, when their crimes are clearly evident without ambiguity, when appropriate punishment is issued, the crimes should be recorded in official documents. For those of audience rank and above, concealing their crimes is considered particularly gracious compared to townspeople's treatment, which is a matter of protocol. It is believed this would be an exceptional matter once protocol is removed. When this was communicated, it was deemed reasonable, and it was decided that when punishment is issued for counterfeit documents and lawless persons in the development area, their crimes should be recorded in official documents.

1. On October 20th, Bunka 5 (1808), year of the dragon, when Mochizuki Matajūrō [...]'s fifty-koku stipend was confiscated and he was placed under house confinement, his three-year-old daughter contracted smallpox with no one to care for her...

[Continuation from previous page] ...did not go out for the thanksgiving ceremony and submitted a request for discretionary confinement, whereupon he was ordered into house arrest. The wife of the aforementioned visitor was also ordered into ten days of confinement.
　However, intermediary Hori Shōbee also requested discretionary confinement at that time and was ordered into house arrest for five days. The reason Shōbee was ordered into house arrest was that he should have immediately reported the incident to the monthly duty inspector but delayed his report.

1. During periods of discretionary confinement when snow accumulates, the intermediary [insertion] Kōka 2nd year, November 19th, there was also a directive regarding laborers should lead retainers to remove snow, with proper notification given. The inspector should be aware of this.

1. On November 19th, Kōka 2nd year, while Taki Jinzaemon had been under punishment, snow gradually accumulated and Jinzaemon's residence collapsed, as reported by intermediary Sakabe Tasōemon to monthly duty official Yamamoto Genzaemon. However, Jinzaemon was under house confinement. Consequently, Jinzaemon was confined to the remaining kitchen area while his family was confined to a small tenement. This was immediately reported to the senior councilors, and inspectors were sent with written reports, which was further reported to the senior councilors. Moreover, there was also a written communication from Sakabe Tasōemon's assistant Tsuneoka Yasuzaemon.

1. The following day, the 20th, Tasōemon's assistant Tsuneoka Yasuzaemon made the following inquiries in writing at the council chamber, so after deliberation with colleagues and consultation with the senior councilors, instructions were given via attached notes:

1. On December 26th, Kyōhō 16th year, during castle deputy Koma Ichiemon's period of discretionary confinement, snow fell and accumulated, making it difficult to clear the snow path in front of his residence. When [redacted] assistant Tanaka Sanemon reported asking what should be done, this was communicated to Yosanzaemon, who replied that the authorities said the path should be cleared. Instructions were given to Noda Jinemon to clear the snow path, and this is on record. I surmise that since Koma Ise was the intermediary, the reason authorities ordered the path cleared might be because it concerned castle grounds, though this is still under consideration.

1. On July 21st, Kyōhō 17th year, while Sakai Rokurōemon was under confinement, intermediary Sakai Jūnosuke informed monthly duty official Tochiya Hanemon that in case of fire in the castle town, when fire approaches Rokurōemon's residence requiring evacuation, Jūnosuke would go to evacuate him. Of course, Jūnosuke would leave his assigned post at that time. Furthermore, when Jūnosuke is on duty and such situations arise, he would send retainers to evacuate Rokurōemon. When this was reported to the senior councilors, they replied "handle as you see fit." He was told to keep this in mind for the future.

1. On the 23rd of the same month and year, while Eguchi Jirōbee was under confinement, [insertion] Hirao Shingobee reported that he wanted to retrieve a storage chest that Hanaki Gontayū had requested to leave at Jirōbee's residence. When the monthly duty inspector consulted with Uneme's office, they were told to retrieve it as they saw fit, and Shingobee was so informed. However, Shingobee was Jirōbee's intermediary. On the 24th, when Shingobee went to Jirōbee's residence as intermediary, he reported that he had retrieved the aforementioned storage chest.

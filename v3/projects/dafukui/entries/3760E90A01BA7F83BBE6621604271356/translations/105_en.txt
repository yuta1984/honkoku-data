...the intention should be communicated to all members. However, special announcements made to unit commanders in the tenth month are covered in the various units section.

1. On July 27th, Kyōhō 8 (1723), year of the rabbit, on the 21st of this month, Yamanaka Kyūbei's stipend was revoked and house arrest was ordered. When inquiring whether such punishment documents from the previous lord should be shown to retainers throughout the domain, it was ruled that the written order for Kyūbei should be shown to all. Hereafter, regarding matters requiring frequent inquiry, cases involving light punishment for misconduct or where the offense appears unclear should not be shown, and this should be understood accordingly.

1. On July 13th, Kyōhō 16 (1731), year of the boar, when District Magistrate Sengoku Shōemon was ordered self-restraint due to negligence in river maintenance under his jurisdiction, Duty Officer Shuri-no-kata directed that one colleague should be added for the announcement at Monthly Inspector Atsumi Shinemon's residence. Accordingly, Tochiua Han'emon was added and the written order was delivered to Shōemon. On the 29th of the same month, when Shōemon's self-restraint was lifted at the Council Chamber, Shuri-no-kata informed Shinemon, who immediately summoned Shōemon to his residence to deliver this news. Han'emon was also present. However, Shōemon stated: "I am grateful for the prompt pardon. Previously, when self-restraint was ordered for misconduct, I understood that announcements were made through colleagues of the same office rank. However, having announcements made through the Inspectors seems to indicate particularly severe punishment. Although I am of the same year of appointment, if this handling becomes precedent for future misconduct by colleagues, it would cause extreme inconvenience regarding official duties. I mention this matter." In response, Han'emon and Shinemon replied that since the punishment handling was directed by the Senior Councilors, they could not comment on it. Both immediately went to Shuri-no-kata to report this, whereupon Shuri-no-kata said: "This is due to Shōemon's ignorance. Announcements through colleagues of the same office rank indicate serious matters. This time, announcements through Inspectors indicate lighter treatment, so this should be understood and communicated to Shōemon again." However, Shuri-no-kata later said to postpone informing Shōemon of this matter. On August 1st, when appearing at Princess Hatsu's quarters, Shuri-no-kata directed that yesterday's report from Shōemon be presented where the Senior Councilors were assembled. After this report, all three colleagues were directed to go to Sakai Yosabei's residence. Since Shōemon's oral report might contain errors, Yosabei requested a written statement. Monthly Officer Kaifuku Tadazaemon summoned Shōemon to his residence where all three colleagues heard the matter, and since written memoranda were brought, all three took them to Yosabei. Since the written statement contained nothing unusual, details are omitted - they are in the general records. During Shōemon's self-restraint, colleague Minagawa Heiemon was appointed to handle official duties, including visiting Shōemon's residence for business, meeting with Shōemon personally, and retrieving official documents, all with Senior Councilors' approval. Since there were official matters, unit members continued their duties at Shōemon's residence. On September 5th, the following was announced through Minagawa Heiemon at the Council Chamber - memorandum for Shōemon:

"Due to negligence in contracted river maintenance construction under your jurisdiction, you were ordered self-restraint, which has now been lifted. However, while you gratefully accepted this at first, you told Tochiua Han'emon and Atsumi Shinemon that having announcements made through Inspectors would cause inconvenience to colleagues if it became precedent. Whether announcements are made through colleagues or Inspectors depends on circumstances and follows precedent. Nevertheless, showing no restraint toward orders from above, acting thoughtlessly and immediately voicing complaints, and belittling punishments constitute serious misconduct deserving strict punishment. However, this is pardoned, your office is revoked, and you are assigned to the Great Guard unit. You must remain in self-restraint. End." September 9th. Pardoned on October 5th.

Regarding this, Shōemon's subordinates and unit deputies were placed under temporary supervision of Hikosaka Matahyōe, and the Inspectors were ordered to announce this.

1. On October 11th of the same year, when Construction Magistrate Hori Shinzaemon's office was revoked and gate closure ordered, the addition of colleague Imamura Dan'emon for the announcement was entrusted to Inspector Yokota Jūemon. Dan'emon was in mourning and could not attend. Although Monthly Inspector was Atsumi Shinemon, since he was closely related to Shinzaemon, he was excluded. Jūemon, being a Matsuoka Inspector and senior, was appointed.

1. On July 21st, Tenpō 7 (1836), year of the monkey, to the Chamberlain in Edo:
"Due to improper conduct during the recent visit to Lord Kishū,    Castle priest with access privileges
access privileges are suspended and the five-person stipend           Hoshino Kyūmin  
previously granted will no longer be provided."

On September 22nd of the same year, to the Chamberlain:
"Since his son Kyūan and colleagues have repeatedly apologized,
access privileges are restored as before and five-person stipend is granted."    Same person

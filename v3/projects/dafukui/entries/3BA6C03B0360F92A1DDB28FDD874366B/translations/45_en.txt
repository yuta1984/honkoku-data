Although we are aware this will cause hardship, due to the aforementioned financial difficulties,
　　　　　　from this year's end, rice contributions (jōmai) will be imposed on those with face-to-face audiences and stipend recipients
　　　　　　according to the separate itemized list. It is decreed that you should understand this intent
　　　　　　and continue to practice even greater frugality.
　　　　　　　　　August 16th
　　　　　　　Note: The separate itemized list follows the same format as in the Year of the Dragon (Tatsu), so it is omitted here. Additionally attached
　　　　　　　　is a record of the accompanying document.
　　　　　　Regarding this rice loan (go-kari-mai): local administrators at 5 bu rate, deputy magistrates at 3 bu 5 rin rate,
　　　　　　and all others including stipend recipients, aid recipients, and rice stipend holders down to the lowest ranks
　　　　　　shall follow the same system as four years ago in the Year of the Dragon.
　　　　　　Please convey this intent. For further details,
　　　　　　inquire with the magistrates.

1. On the same day, as New Year's felicitations, a ceremonial sword and horse fee were presented through the messenger Mizutani Oribe (Katsuki), who served as御奏者番 (gojōsyaban - liaison officer).
The same offerings were presented to the Dainagon (Great Counselor).
However, due to illness preventing his attendance at the castle, the presentations were made through a messenger.

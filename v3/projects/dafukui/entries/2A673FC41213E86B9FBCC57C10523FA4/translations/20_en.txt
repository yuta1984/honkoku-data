Even if matters concerning various shrines are brought up, while this may benefit those who handle such affairs, it will not reach the general populace to sustain their lives, and rather evil matters may arise. Therefore, the intent of this matter should be thoroughly considered before issuing orders. The above.
　　Kyōhō 5, Fifth Month

　　　Memorandum
1. Regarding petitions that have been submitted, for those that are deemed difficult to grant after examination, inform the petitioners in writing that such items cannot be procured. Those who have had documents prepared unnecessarily and appear repeatedly shall be told they will be fined, and if they still appear for litigation after this warning, they shall indeed be fined.

1. Even among parents and children, siblings, and other relatives, petitions for pardons from punishments and also petitions regarding judicial decisions are separate matters, so they should be understood as before.

1. When petitions not taken up by the magistrate's office are brought as litigation to the rōjū (senior councilors), wakadoshiyori (junior councilors), etc., if when asked whether they have appeared before the magistrate's office they say they have not yet appeared, they should be told to appear before the magistrate at that time. If they say they appeared at the magistrate's office but it was not taken up, the litigation should be taken up and passed to the magistrates.

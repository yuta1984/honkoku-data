The port we refer to is under the jurisdiction of Obama Domain,
and our domain's territory is located in the land
called Maruyama within Tsuruga District. Regarding this matter,
various official business concerning Tsuruga Port has repeatedly
resulted in official communications being sent to our domain, causing confusion
and greatly troubling you, which is entirely due to the fact that the name and reality are
contrary to each other.
If this continues, the harm from increasing confusion
will surely grow greater, which we find truly unbearable and fearful,
causing us anxiety and distress. Therefore, we humbly request that henceforth
our domain be renamed as Maruyama Domain

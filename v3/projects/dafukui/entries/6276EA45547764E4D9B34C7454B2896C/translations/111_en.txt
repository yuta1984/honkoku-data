Article 1: When samurai wish to travel to the home domain and desire to lodge in Kanazawa in the provincial capital, if they consult with the inspectors here in Edo, this will be discussed with the senior retainers, and later a messenger will be sent to explain the matter.

Article 1: When all members of the domain retinue, down to the lowest ranks, depart for the home domain, on that morning at the gate office, group members shall present and inspect baggage.
For senior retainers' baggage, according to prior notice the day before, foot inspectors and group members shall be sent to the long barracks to meet with the retainers. Since this concerns official duties, there should be no discrepancies. They shall return after exchanging greetings and requesting continued diligence.

Article 1: During the Kansei era, the upper residence shall be inspected three times monthly, and the outer residences twice monthly. Previously, reports of these inspections were sent to the home domain on half-sheets of paper, but this has recently been discontinued.
However, during years when the lord is absent, reports are sent on half-sheets of paper. The Reiganjima residence shall be inspected twice monthly.

Article 1: Regarding the matter of lower-rank absconding, when the master submits written reports and miscellaneous documents, this shall be reported to the senior retainers, and handled according to domain law as ordered. Gate passage permits shall be sent to the gatekeeper for collection.
In general, when lower-ranking persons go out and do not return by gate closing time, if their supervisor or master requests to post missing person notices, these shall be submitted to the gate office as instructed. Even if missing person notices are posted repeatedly day and night, we do not inquire about how to handle this from our side. When inquiries about suspected locations yield no results, this appears to be absconding, and written reports shall be made to the supervisory heads. When such documents are circulated to us and we receive and acknowledge them, we report to the senior retainers. If there are no particular concerns, instructions will be given to handle according to domain law. At that time, we no longer handle matters with the supervisory head or master. Gate notices shall be submitted and stored in the official document box. If they are domain residents, notification shall be sent to the home domain.

Article 1: Regarding the hiring and dismissing of domain retainers' servants: For matters concerning domain residents, notifications from masters shall be sent to the home domain.
However, for hiring and dismissing within the residence compound, acknowledgment is sufficient. For sending outside the gate or employing from outside the gate, notification shall be sent to the home domain.

Article 1: When domain retainers dismiss servants and send them back to the home domain with travel money according to domain law, the master shall submit a written report to the inspector. This shall also be reported to the home domain.

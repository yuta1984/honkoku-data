1. On the 24th day of the intercalary 5th month of Kyōhō 17, Year of the Rat, the regulations for securing the rear areas of Reiganjima Residence were submitted to the guard posts.

1. Records of the guard posts from when Lady Yōjuin moved to Reiganjima Residence.

1. The north wooden gate of the rear area shall be regularly locked, with the lock seal to be inspected by Suzuki Yasuke, the residence custodian. When passage through the rear area is needed for official business, Yasuke shall come out and handle it. Normally, it shall remain regularly locked.

1. Regarding the rear entrance behind Lady Chikōin's chambers, it is decreed that permission from the regular guard post is required day and night, and no one shall enter or exit the rear area without authorization. Routine official business shall be conducted through this entrance. Of course, night watch duty shall commence at "mutsu-giri" (around 6 PM).

1. Since the rear water gate is currently blocked, this naval guard post shall be moved to the south wooden gate entrance via Hikiba-dōri. The protection of the rear of Lady Yōjuin's quarters, as well as the passage for guard personnel from the south wooden gate to the corner guard post and night patrol personnel, shall be conducted through this entrance. Other entrances and exits shall normally be unnecessary.

1. Regarding those under Suzuki Yasuke's supervision who work in flower cultivation in the rear area:
Since they are positioned advantageously with a clear view behind Lady Yōjuin's quarters, whether these personnel should be required to sign pledge documents and be ordered to perform day and night security duties for the rear area closure.

1. The guard post behind Lady Katsuhime's quarters shall continue to be used as is.
Since it is conveniently located along the passage behind Lady Yōjuin's long chambers, orders should be given to protect both quarters and maintain day and night guard posts.

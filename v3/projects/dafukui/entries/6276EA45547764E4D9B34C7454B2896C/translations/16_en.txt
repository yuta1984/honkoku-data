However, when retainers going on missions to other domains leave behind family members or designate a trusted person to rely upon, they may pass through the gate. In such cases, this must be reported to the inspector officials. The same applies to those who are seriously ill.

1. Regarding clerks and itinerant laborers, as before, gate passes shall be issued by the head of their supervisors. When sending itinerant laborers as messengers, unless they are assigned to fire prevention duties, this shall be done as before.

1. Those who inspect passes at the guard post need not be mentioned, but all other personnel must regularly memorize the official seals to ensure no counterfeit or suspicious passes are allowed through.

1. Senior councilors Ogino Magonouemon and Shimada Kuranosuke, and members of the ceremonial attendant corps, when going out at night on official business, may pass through without permission. When going out on private business, they must obtain permission themselves.

1. Since the head pages are serving as substitute ceremonial attendants, the same rules shall apply to them.

　　　　　　　Memorandum
1. Regarding official visits, on days when processions pass through the vicinity of the estate, no merchants whatsoever shall be allowed through before the official visit.
　　　　　However, those coming to the kitchen on official business are an exception, as are those with urgent business at the treasury or construction office who must attend, and these may be allowed through after confirmation.

1. After the procession has passed and thereafter, tell those entering through the gate to "finish early and return home today," and if they do not leave by seven o'clock in the evening, report to the inspector officials' quarters stating "this many people still remain at the estate."
In general, on such days, take care not to allow many merchants to enter.

1. When messengers from elsewhere come to the estate's long houses, first confirm and record the name of their master. Record to whom they are going in the long houses. If such messengers stay long within the estate, go inquire at the relevant long house, and if they say "we sent him back earlier," immediately go to the inspector officials' quarters to report this. However, if they say the messenger is still there as reported, proceed accordingly.

1. Merchants who do not regularly come to the estate for business but are merely passing through shall strictly not be allowed to enter the gate. Those who come regularly and are recognized may enter. Even if they are sales assistants or retainers of those who have been coming to the estate for business for several years, if they are not recognized, they must be questioned.

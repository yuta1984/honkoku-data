Recent precedent issued from the 5th year of An'ei, year of the monkey
Article 1: At the time of departure, when escort formation is ordered and word is received that [the lord] will subsequently enter, proceed to the vicinity of the gun room, place one's sword at one's side, observe the inspector's advance party, exit from the main entrance, and after the clearing of spears, horses, tea, and lunch boxes is completed, proceed to that side and then take position at the escort location

　　　Happyakuri says: The above concerns matters issued regarding departure from Edo. However, since it states that at the home domain, the duty method of proceeding to the vicinity of the gun room follows the previous article, this is recorded incidentally. The main text is recorded later.

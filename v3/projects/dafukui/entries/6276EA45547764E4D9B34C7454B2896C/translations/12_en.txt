However, matters concerning teachers and doctors are exceptional
1. Since there is no service at the shogunate this time, everyone should practice economy so that they can maintain their household finances. When going out, they should dress modestly and be prudent wherever they go.

　　　　　　5th month, 21st day
　The above matters should be communicated to colleagues during shift changes. End
　The above was ordered through a written directive from the senior councilors.
1. On Kyōhō 18, Ox year, 4th month, 18th day, chief retainer Sasaji Gonuemon conveyed that regarding musical instruments within the mansion, though they have been prohibited since the previous lord's time, since the close attendants also serve as companions, training is necessary for entertainment. Since Akashi Kunaino resides in the inner long house, the pages and others should practice musical instruments in Kunaino's long house as ordered. Also, Hatano Toyouemon and Tsutsui Sanai similarly serve as companions, so these two should practice in the long house. Hashimoto Kiheiji currently resides in the outer long house, but since flute practice is difficult there, it was communicated to the ceremonial attendants that he should enter the inner long house. Once in the inner long house, those practicing flute can visit Kiheiji's quarters, so this should be understood. Apart from musical instrument practice at these people's quarters, everything follows previous generations' orders. If some think musical instruments are permitted throughout the mansion, this would be problematic, so they should understand not to be careless, and if anyone inquires, they should respond accordingly.

○ The regulations issued from before and the mansion etiquette should be observed even more strictly as previously ordered. Regarding banquets and gatherings, only one soup and one dish besides pickles should be allowed as per previous regulations. Gift exchanges should also be observed as before. Generally, given the current times, everyone should not desire luxury and practice frugality; plain clothing is acceptable. Gatherings are especially important for unity and harmony, so holding gatherings while observing regulations is acceptable. These matters should be communicated as ordered, so this should be understood. End

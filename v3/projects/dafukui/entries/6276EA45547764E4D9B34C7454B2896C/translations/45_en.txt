This shall be communicated to the guards. Regarding the matter of grouped intersection guard posts, the leaders shall understand these points and conduct thorough examinations of the guards and keep them in place.
The above points were ordered by Lord Matsudaira Nuinokami to Inspector Matsudaira Shōkurō on the 12th day of the 12th month of the 4th year of Meiwa, year of the Boar.

　　　　From Senior Inspector Lord Ikeda Chikugonokami on the 19th day of the 12th month of the 3rd year of An'ei, year of the Horse
　　　　Official notice and written order as follows:

1. Recently, there have been many people who make hoods that conceal their faces and wear them while traveling. Since this makes it difficult for magistrate offices to identify wanted persons, except for the traditional round hoods and square hoods that have existed from before, no other head coverings shall be worn.
This was proclaimed in the 3rd year of Kanpō, year of the Boar, but recently it has been reported that there are again people who make strange-style hoods that conceal their faces and walk around wearing them, which is improper conduct. Hereafter, if there are people who make and wear face-concealing hoods while walking, when patrol guards at residences see them and find their appearance suspicious, they shall make them remove their hoods and question them. If they are suspicious persons, they shall be arrested and handed over to the town magistrate without need for prior notification. However, mistaken accusations are acceptable.
　　　　12th month
This shall be proclaimed accordingly.

1. Regarding intersection guard duties in general: when there are violent persons, injured persons, suspicious persons, or mentally disturbed or intoxicated persons, the duty to immediately go out and report to the group organization is specified in the intersection guard regulations of various places and is well known. Furthermore, after a written order was issued in the 1st year of Meiwa, year of the Monkey, stating that intersection guards should perform their duties without negligence, Inspector Magatani Katsujirō, who was in charge of intersection guards during his term of service, also issued proclamations at that time. However, since this is a matter taken lightly, misunderstandings cannot be overlooked, so this is discussed again. In general, not only for one's own patrol area and assigned area, but even in other intersection guard patrol areas where incidents are observed, regardless of patrol boundaries, when there are mentally disturbed persons, intoxicated persons, fights, arguments, or other obstructions to public traffic, guards shall immediately go out and restrain them. Those who do not comply shall be arrested and handed over to the intersection guard of that assigned area, where their lodging places shall be investigated. Those to be handed over shall be summoned, and future matters shall be strictly ordered before release. If matters become complicated and reach an impasse, the group organization shall report to the inspectors. If intoxicated persons obstruct public traffic, they are clearly intoxicated; if they do not respond to alcohol, they are mentally disturbed. The handling method is straightforward - handle according to established law. Hereafter, there shall be no misunderstandings.
The above points shall be understood in the same manner by individual duty guards and district group organizations.

1. Recently, a person named Nishimura Kinosuke falsely claimed to be an official falconer and deceived people in various places, making them provide horses and labor, and furthermore borrowed money improperly.

Regarding intersection guard posts in general: recently it has been reported that some places improperly keep their doors closed during the night and fail to properly patrol their areas. As ordered in the past regulations, the doors in front of guard posts should be kept open during the night, patrol areas should be frequently circulated, and if suspicious persons are found, they should be detained and reported to the inspectors.

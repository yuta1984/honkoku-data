Additionally, as decreed in the home domain in previous years, employing public stipend recipients and people from other domains, down to young retainers and servants, is unnecessary. If there are unavoidable circumstances, report to the inspectors and obtain their instructions. Regarding [unclear] stipend matters, follow the previous year's official notices as before, and generally employ servants with progressively lighter [salaries] according to their status [unclear]. If you naturally employ them with high salaries, the master will be considered negligent, so you should understand this accordingly. The above

　　Additionally, those with group supervisory duties should communicate the intent of this official notice

1. As previously announced, regarding retainers that everyone employs from outside the gate, you should carefully instruct the lodging masters and guarantors here at the origin. Moreover, for those who are local residents, written documentation from name origins, lodging masters, and guarantors should be submitted.
　　　　Additionally, even those from the home domain who have resided in this locality for a long time should be treated the same as local residents, so written documentation should also be submitted for them

1. When dismissing those employed from outside the gate, even if they find positions at mansions, notification should be made by the dismissing party as well. Moreover, since the employing party should also treat it the same as employing from outside the gate, notification should be made regarding such matters through written documentation from lodging masters and guarantors. Furthermore, those employed from outside the gate should definitely make notification when employing them, as has been done previously. Those who do not make notification when employing from outside the gate will not be allowed to

send them outside the gate when dismissing them, so this intent should be understood. The above

1. The draft document for the personnel change official notice issued on January 11th is to be reviewed by the senior councilors. When there are notifications from masters regarding personnel changes, both departures and arrivals should be recorded in our registry. Even when people from the domain territory request to go down from the mansion to the riverbank to engage in trade, it cannot be done directly - they must first return to the home domain, petition the respective supervisors, and be entered in the official register before they can depart.

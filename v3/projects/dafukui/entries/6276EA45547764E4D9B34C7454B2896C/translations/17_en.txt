○Regarding those who are normally refused entry under gate regulations going in and out of the gate before gate opening or at night on official business - this should be reported to the inspector officials, but when there are official announcements from the monthly duty officials regarding open official business, it is not necessary to report to the inspector officials.

1. When outsiders come, the guard post must assign an escort. First, for fire prevention, on windy days when outsiders come and are not recognized, inquire about their business, and if it is not urgent business, since entry is difficult on windy days, tell them to come when the wind stops, perhaps tomorrow, and do not let them enter carelessly.
　　　　However, if samurai come stating they are visiting a master of the long houses, they may pass through. Nevertheless, unknown persons must be assigned an escort.

1. In general, when outsiders come, guards must record both parties' names in the ledger and provide an escort. Those carrying swords, regardless of status, as well as temple and shrine personnel, doctors and similar people shall be escorted by foot soldiers. Those with one sword or no sword, as well as women and laborers, shall be escorted accordingly. When outsiders return, it must be reported that someone from that location will escort them out.

1. When people come from elsewhere, confirm their destination by asking "which direction are you going?" and inquire "are you not going anywhere else?" If they have business in multiple places, have them state this at their destination and arrange escorts to conduct their business. Otherwise, it will be troublesome when exiting the gate - this should be explained to them.

1. Among those on regular duty, when people come from elsewhere to visit those of lower rank who have no servants, since there are no escorts available, the guards must use their discretion to escort them.

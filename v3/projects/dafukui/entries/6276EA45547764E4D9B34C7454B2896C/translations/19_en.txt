　　　　　One volume: Record of memoranda submitted to the East and West gate posts in Edo

1. When messengers are sent from elsewhere to the mansion's retainers, at both the East and West Gates, confirm which master sent them and to which person in our long houses they are going, record this in the ledger, and allow them to pass. If such messengers appear to be of dubious character that is difficult to verify, assign escorts to accompany them when they go to deliver their message, and confirm that there are no discrepancies.

1. Traveling merchants who do not regularly come to the mansion for business must absolutely not be allowed to enter the gate. Even those who don't usually come may enter if they are known persons. Even if someone has been coming to the mansion for business for several years, if their servants or retainers are unknown persons, conduct an examination before allowing them entry.

1. For retainers of 100 koku or more, when messengers come from elsewhere, they must quickly send notice to the gate post stating from whom and to whom the messenger is coming.
　　Note: Regarding rice stipend recipients, since they have no servants to send, it is difficult to send notice messengers. For lower-ranking members, the gate shall send escorts to deliver the messengers. Even if messengers come repeatedly, if two escorts are sent, they shall be detained at the gate, and sent on with escort as soon as the escort returns. For these escorts, two advance ashigaru are assigned, so the gate guards shall conduct examinations and dispatch appropriate escorts.

1. When messengers are sent from various lodgings to the lord's heir's female attendants, conduct examinations, receive details, record in the ledger, and allow passage. Kashio Matazaemon, Yanagishita Sehyōe, and Nakane Rihyōe shall quickly send servants with notice to the gate. If the person appears suspicious in manner, assign escorts when dispatching them.

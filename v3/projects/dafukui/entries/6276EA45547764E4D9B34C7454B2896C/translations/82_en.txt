The ceremonial handbook is handed down by officials, and using this handbook, matters are carried out in the antechamber down to the lowest levels. Each person receives it directly from the meal attendants.

1. When senior councilors appear before the lord, chamberlains precede them.
   However, when going to the formal reception hall, inspectors precede them.
   When going to the guardian hall, foot inspectors precede them. In general, when senior councilors go from their rooms to the front areas, or to the audience hall, or anywhere to the lower areas, foot inspectors precede them.

2. When domain relatives unexpectedly visit for condolence calls, when senior councilors go out, chamberlains must relay the message. Inspectors serve as escorts, but only up to the antechamber.

3. For New Year and the five seasonal festivals, all retainers from both the upper mansion and Reiganjima must go to the mansion and pay their respects. Those who have already had audiences and those without stipends must also attend. On ceremonial days, only those at the upper mansion attend; they do not go to Reiganjima. Regarding children, they do not attend monthly or ceremonial days at either the upper mansion or elsewhere.
   As described above, for audience seating, secretaries go to the long hearth room. Senior guards, caretaker guards, and new guards go to the front great hall.

4. When Great Prajñāpāramitā Sutra prayers are held at the mansion in the 1st, 5th, and 9th months, senior councilors and others wear fukusa hemp kamishimo while on duty. From the previous evening, mourning clothes are changed at the mansion.

5. When there are official letters or bestowed items through senior ladies-in-waiting, when officials express gratitude, those on duty need not wear hemp kamishimo but may wear duty attire. Those coming from the small quarters should wear hemp kamishimo. (Established on the 4th day of the 5th month of Meiwa 6, year of the Ox)

6. On the five seasonal festivals and Hassaku when going to Edo Castle, officials attend and pay respects, then withdraw at their discretion, and need not remain on duty afterward, as announced on the 9th day of the 9th month of Meiwa 6, year of the Ox, by chamberlain Matsudaira Kaname.

7. When the young lord enters from Reiganjima, in years when he resides in the domain there are no upper mansion duty assignments, so inspectors on duty serve as escorts. When not on duty, they do not serve as escorts.

8. Regarding passage before the gate:
   When the young lord enters and takes up residence in the small reception hall, inspectors serve as escorts. All such matters should follow this precedent.

9. In the New Year, when the lord's consort first goes out for New Year greetings, senior councilors, chamberlains, and officials wear fukusa hemp kamishimo. From the 7th day onward, this is the standard format. When first going out for New Year visits, the military commander in charge of the west gate attends, and when he appears, they go to the gate office. When returning to the mansion after 7 PM in the evening, senior councilors, chamberlains, minor officials, and those in charge of gates do not attend.

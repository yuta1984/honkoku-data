Within the Nitenmon Gate, one cannot enter on horseback. This goes without saying, but it is communicated for proper understanding.

1. Water rounds shall be performed daily.
   However, during rainy weather, rounds are not required.

1. When the wooden clappers are struck, the attendants for the lord's departure shall prepare and gather at the front of the small entrance upon notification to serve as attendants.
When the lord departs, boards shall be struck and continue to be struck until all personnel have deployed.

When there are official matters during the lord's departure and one is summoned, or when there are matters to report, there is no need to dismount - report while mounted.

1. Each person's spear shall be placed together with their riding horse.

1. Picking up even small items along the way is strictly forbidden. Also, forcibly taking or buying food, sandals, straw sandals, and similar items is strictly prohibited - this must be firmly communicated to lower-ranking personnel and everyone's retainers.

1. Horse banners are medium black during the day, and at night use hōkoma lanterns - understand this accordingly.

1. When a fire occurs and personnel deploy, proceed without forming processions. This should also be communicated in advance to those carrying firefighting equipment, so they deploy sequentially without competing. At the scene, they should be instructed to gather in one location as previously ordered for each unit.

1. When the fire subsides and personnel withdraw, if encountering Senior or Junior Councilors, and of course the Three Branch Houses, dismount and clear the way.

1. When the fire subsides and personnel withdraw, lead horses out to outside the Black Gate and mount up to return sequentially.

1. When it is confirmed that fire has broken out within Ueno Sacred Mountain, ride up near the fire source, dismount, and proceed sequentially to the fire location.
At that time, dismounting posts are not a concern. When officials or dignitaries are present, be mindful of this. The Monzeki (imperial prince-abbot) may also appear, so be mindful of both situations.

1. When entering from along the route, even taking a slight detour is acceptable, so have advance riders ensure entry from side roads.
If proceeding in formation from the front, everyone need not dismount but should bow deeply while passing.

1. Among the second unit personnel, if there are official matters and horses remain behind with the rear guard, those attendants should proceed from the rear. There is no need to ride ahead or proceed to the front via side roads.

1. At the seventh hour (4 PM), regarding imperial lanterns and domain lanterns, those from the upper residence should gather at the front of the small entrance, and palanquin attendants and foot soldiers in charge of lanterns should follow instructions.

1. When urgent matters arise en route, wooden clappers shall be struck by the horse guards.

1. When lanterns are set up after nightfall, at the scene, attendants from the second unit, escort inspectors, and palanquin attendants shall consult together to give instructions.

1. When the fire is extinguished and personnel withdraw from the scene, wooden clappers shall be struck at the location.

Jōkyō 4th year, Year of the Fire Rabbit (1687)
1. January 1st: Attended court for New Year's greetings, presented ten ryō of gold as a substitute offering for the ceremonial sword and horse, and received silk garments as a gift
1. Same month, 4th day: As this year marks the unlucky year for the Shogun, last December we dispatched messenger Ōida Shinkurō (Tsune[?]) to Ise to request prayers. Prayers were conducted at both shrines (with sacred kagura music), and these prayers were completed today.
　　However, when Shinkurō returned carrying the purification items from the prayers, he handed them over to messenger Misawa Jinuemon on the road, who then presented them to the Edo authorities.

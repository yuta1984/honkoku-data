1. Not only in public domains, but also regarding other domains, other villages, and fellow farmers,
all unreasonable lawsuits and boundary disputes shall be
completely prohibited. However, when there are unavoidable circumstances requiring litigation,
the village headman, senior farmers, and their five-person groups shall be present,
conduct careful investigations, and if there are reliable documents and evidence
with clear legal grounds and no ambiguity,
they may submit petitions honestly without embellishment. If false statements are made
and excessive unreasonable claims are submitted, not only the person concerned
but also the village headman and senior farmers shall be held responsible.
　Note: Submitting additional petitions, or becoming impatient waiting for judgment
　　and making direct appeals, or requesting intervention through personal connections
　　are strictly prohibited.

1. All farmers' seals shall be handled with great care at all times. Village headmen and
senior farmers shall create seal registers in ledger form and deliver them to group leaders,
who shall bring them here. If a seal is lost
or remade, it shall be brought together with the group leader and
recorded in the ledger.

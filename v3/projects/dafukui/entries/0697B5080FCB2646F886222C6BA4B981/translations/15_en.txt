　　to Sakai Magoshirō Motonobu were seated in attendance, and the content of His Lordship's message to those summoned was as follows,
　　which Uneme conveyed:
　　　　　Regarding the matter of domain territory being granted this time, all will be
　　　　　newly employed, but [your stipends] will be reduced by half from the amounts previously allocated,
　　　　　so you should understand this. Though His Lordship feels it unfortunate that this will cause hardship for all,
　　　　　
　　　　　given the current domain income, it cannot be done as His Lordship would wish,
　　　　　so all matters should be conducted with restraint in your service. The above
　　　　　　　Memorandum
　　　1. All stipends (haichi) reduced by half
　　　1. Those receiving 150 koku reduced to 100 koku
　　　1. Those receiving 100 koku have no reduction

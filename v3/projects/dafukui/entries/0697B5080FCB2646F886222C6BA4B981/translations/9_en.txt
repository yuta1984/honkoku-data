1. 4th month, 15th day: At the residence of Honda Magotarō 《marginal note: Nagazane》, Magotarō took his seat for the first time in the council of senior retainers,
   and messenger Hagino Gen'emon 《marginal note: Masataka》 sat in attendance to convey the lord's intentions as follows to Takachi and other retainers:
　　　The lord's intentions:
　　　　　On the 28th day of last month, you successfully presented your gratitude for the fief grant.
　　　　　The mansion here is without incident, and we have been hearing continuously that
　　　　　your area is peaceful, which brings great satisfaction. What is being announced this time
　　　　　concerns the retainers of this long-established house. We would very much like to
　　　　　employ them, but since the fief income has been considerably reduced, it is difficult to provide adequate support.
　　　　　We consider this situation extremely troublesome. We think it pitiful that all the retainers
　　　　　will suffer hardship. After consultation, announcements will be made gradually.
　　　　　Until then, for their own sake as well, everyone should
　　　　　conduct themselves without causing any disturbances.

those who spend day and night wandering about in leisure, who engage in litigation,
mediate in disputes and obstruct village affairs, and who do not heed people's
advice—such unruly persons should be reported.
After deliberation, punishment shall be imposed. If such matters are concealed and discovered later,
the village headman, senior farmers, and their five-person groups shall be
held responsible.

1. Regarding official duties and various services, one must strictly follow the instructions
given by group leaders and village headmen.
If one disobeys and official duties are
delayed, it shall be considered a transgression.

1. Village relay and post station relay dispatch documents should be forwarded
without delay to the next stations. During urgent official business, documents with double seals should have the time
of arrival at that post station or village recorded with a seal affixed, and quickly
forwarded to subsequent stations. If there are delays, the village headman of that village or the
wholesale agent of that post station shall be held responsible.

1. When filing lawsuits or making any other kind of petition,
御蔵百姓 (gokura hyakusho - farmers under direct shogunal control) must obtain permission and instructions from the deputy administrator
before proceeding. 給知百姓 (kyūchi hyakusho - farmers granted land) should proceed through their group leaders.
　Note: Regarding litigation matters in 給所 (kyūsho - granted territories), the territorial lord shall not interfere.

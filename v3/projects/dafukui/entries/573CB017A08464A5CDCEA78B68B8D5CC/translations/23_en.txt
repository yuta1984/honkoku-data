　　　　　　Written orders to be communicated to Kanazu Magistrate, Town Magistrate, and District Magistrate
1. When Kanazu Magistrate, Town Magistrate, and District Magistrate conduct deliberations at their official residences and offices, even if inspectors are present, matters of punishment inquiries that have been deliberated and settled should be reported by those magistrates following the customary reporting procedures. Since ancient times, each office has had its regulations, and there are precedent record books and official regulation books given to the three magistrates for making inquiries on such occasions. For offenses not covered in the regulation books, they become matters for deliberation at that time, and inspectors' opinions should be communicated through written documents, which is well understood. Punishment inquiries should be made by the respective magistrates following ancient customs as before.

1. When the lord is in Edo, oral statements during inspector-attended deliberations should be forwarded by the respective magistrates to inspectors stationed in Edo.

1. It is considered a misconduct for inspectors to write punishment inquiry documents themselves and circulate deliberations through oral statements. Deliberations should be handled as individual cases by each respective magistrate. If inspectors handle these matters themselves, there would be no point in appointing Kanazu Magistrate, Town Magistrate, and District Magistrate to their positions.

As stated above, it is commanded that there be no misconduct hereafter. End.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To All Monthly Duty Officers
〇Due to ongoing financial difficulties and the great flood of last summer causing excessive crop damage in the domain, plus enormous repair costs and expenses mounting up, combined with accumulated debts creating an unavoidable financial crisis, we are compelled to request a half-reduction rice loan from all retainers for this year. Accordingly, written orders are being distributed. All matters should be understood according to the precedent when half-reduction rice loans were ordered in previous years, and magistrates will provide further instructions. Additionally, by the lord's decision, frugality measures are being ordered, so separate written orders will be distributed.

　　　　　　Written Order
　For some time, the domain finances have been running annual deficits with no solution in sight. Since the year before last, through the lord's special consideration, various financial reforms have been implemented from his personal funds, hoping that eventually even a small portion of rice loans might be forgiven. Strict austerity measures were also ordered, but before these policies could take effect, last summer's ancient

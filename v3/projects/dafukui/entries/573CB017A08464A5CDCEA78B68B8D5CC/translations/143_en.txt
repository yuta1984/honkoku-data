Later　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Inspector

〇In previous years, according to the policy, the number of押足軽 (押ashigaru - guard foot soldiers) in the procession for countryside rounds was reduced, but it has been reported that this is currently causing difficulties. After deliberation, two押officers will be added.
1. One押officer will be added to the procession for rounds within the castle town. The above has been announced.

1. Regarding the entire retinue procession when departing from the palace, it has been heard that there is confusion with various matters, so the retainers and their subordinates should be strictly ordered to observe the previous regulations. Of course, the foot soldier inspectors and押officers should also be ordered not to be careless, and furthermore, the inspectors should be consulted thoroughly so that the procession proceeds properly, and each should communicate to their respective departments as previously discussed.

The above has been communicated to the chamberlains, so please consult and handle appropriately.

The shogunate's judgment has been completed and the territorial boundaries are as previously established. However, to prevent further confusion from arising, this time after reporting to the shogunate, a new guardhouse was built near the port's rudder burial ground to ensure that various locations do not become disorderly. Furthermore, since border crossings with other domains are a delicate matter requiring careful consideration, for now one person from among the group officials and one person from Atsumi Shinemon's group (selected after examining their character), totaling two people, should be assigned to guard the area. These matters should also be communicated to Shinemon. Additionally, regarding the duties and various regulations at this location, Shinemon should consult and provide thorough instructions. Regarding these matters, the following has been granted to the guards, so this should also be understood and ordered accordingly:
　　Annual rice allowance: 8 bales　　　　　　One inspector group official
　　Same as above　　　　　　　　　　　　　One from Atsumi Shinemon's group

○Regarding the killing of various animals by townspeople and rural residents, while this has long been prohibited, in recent years it has become excessive, and particularly there have been reports of improper conduct when going out for falconry and relay stations, which is most inappropriate. Henceforth, if there are any questionable matters, investigations will be conducted and punishments will be imposed accordingly, so this must be strictly observed without any misunderstanding. That is all.

○Regarding this year's decision that the young lord will serve as representative for the first entry, and a written notice issued for everyone's understanding

Concerning this year's return to the domain, there is a private petition from His Lordship, and regarding the young lord entering the domain as representative, there have been investigations since last year concerning succession to Hitotsubashi Chūnagon, but because the financial situation is extremely difficult, regulations could not be established and the public announcement has been delayed. However, the petition for the young lord to enter as representative will soon be submitted and decided upon. Furthermore, regarding financial matters, various financial methods have been announced successively, but originally the revenue collection was low, and there has been excessive debt from before, making it difficult to establish policy, and due to these financial difficulties, there is great concern that even assistance for the future of the house may be affected. Therefore, extraordinary financial methods will be established successively, and strict supervision will be announced. All members of the retainer band should especially practice frugality, mutually pay attention to avoid all extravagant matters, and observe what has been previously announced. Furthermore, there should be no misunderstandings. The above.

Written Notice　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the various group heads

○In recent years, with gracious consideration, the various group heads have been summoned before His Lordship regarding the supervision of their subordinates and the control of the retainer band, and great effort has been made to ensure there are no misunderstandings or misconduct. However, with such a large retainer band, there will inevitably be some imprudent individuals, and punishments have been ordered. Recently, although there has been diligence in martial arts and learning, the conduct is poor and characterized by laziness, naturally leading to misconduct. The heads of various group supervisions should thoroughly understand this and take care that no misconduct occurs. Henceforth, group heads should not think that their duty consists only of relaying various petitions, but should understand that the proper functioning of their assigned group supervision is of primary importance. Should there be any misconduct, while it would be regrettable, it would be unfortunate if strict punishments were frequently necessary, so this is announced for understanding.

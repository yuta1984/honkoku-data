○This summer's repeated floods caused significant shortfalls in tax collection, and with enormous expenses for river maintenance, embankments, roads, and bridges, the domain finances were already in difficulty, leading to even greater constraints. Even official duties to the shogunate risk being compromised, making this a critical matter. Various internal consultations were held, but no viable solutions could be found, leaving no alternative but to request emergency funds from townspeople and farmers. However, this year's floods have caused universal hardship, which has reached the lord's attention, causing him great concern. Due to his status, extraordinary frugality and tightening measures will be gradually announced. Nevertheless, since there is absolutely no way to manage through the current year-end, after thorough deliberation, financial arrangements have been requested from reliable persons. This is also an extremely difficult request, but it is unavoidable under the circumstances. Given these times, everyone from highest to lowest must endure hardships without regard, strictly observe tightening measures, and manage with consideration so as not to burden their superiors as much as possible. Each person should ensure this message is conveyed to all subordinates without misunderstanding.

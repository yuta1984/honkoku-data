〇Written orders circulated from Edo as follows:
　　　　　　Written orders to be communicated to officials
1. It is hereby announced that when officials are summoned to the lord's chambers where he usually enters on ordinary days for official business, the reason they were not previously summoned was due to frequent misconduct among officials in the second year of An'ei (Year of the Snake), which led to strict measures at that time. Those who attend as partners for Noh and musical performances have no connection to the lord's chambers and also attend the inner quarters, so they are summoned for official business. Originally, officials also had misconduct, the nature of which was that some regarded themselves as equivalent to personal attendants, which is a grave misconduct. Without distinction of rank importance, those in close service to the lord are pages, followed by personal attendants. Important positions include senior councilors, tutors, and administrators. Similar to these are palace administrators and physicians. Regarding senior retainers, they hold the highest positions and are in a separate category. The aforementioned official positions form one group, while other official positions are external. It is the lord's intention that officials should understand this distinction well at their seating. The reason is that since ancient times, when there was urgent business to report, one could not appear directly before the lord; previously, pages would be called to relay the message, and only then, when ordered, would one appear. Henceforth, it is the lord's intention that the official seating arrangement shall return to the ancient way, so without misconduct, one should concentrate on serving the lord's interests.

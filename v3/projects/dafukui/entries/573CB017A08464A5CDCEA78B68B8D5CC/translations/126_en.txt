○Recently, we have heard that suspicious tanomoshi-ko (rotating credit associations) are being organized in the outlying towns. Is there any conflict with the matter circulated through copies of the circular from the Great Inspectors in the 4th year of Meiwa, Year of the Boar? If by any chance these are withdrawal-type mujin-ko (unlimited mutual financing associations), they would be prohibited matters, so arrangements should be made to prevent similar practices from increasing.
　　　　However, regarding the leaders of such associations, particularly severe punishments are prescribed by law, so this should be communicated to prevent any misunderstanding.

○This winter, due to heavy snowfall, mountain villagers and those in mountain-adjacent villages are hunting wild boar and deer. The farmers are working diligently to eliminate harm to their main occupation and carefully tend to their various crops, which is most commendable. However, at hunting grounds, some have been attacked by wild boar, suffering deep wounds and facing life-threatening situations, which is a matter of great pity according to His Lordship's remarks. Each official should conduct investigations and submit written reports about those who are suffering greatly from such deep wounds.

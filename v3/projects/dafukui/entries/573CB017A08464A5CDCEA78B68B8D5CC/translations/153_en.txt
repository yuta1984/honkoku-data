The streets should be strictly guarded, and group leaders and town officials should be instructed not to be negligent. Moreover, regarding those who were investigated this time, out of compassion all were granted permission to reside, but if there is any handling contrary to what has been proclaimed regarding future matters, it will be considered a transgression by the officials.

Article 1: Regarding placing in town those who have exit certificates and acceptance certificates, checking against these certificates should ensure certainty, though it may depend on the quality of the town official who accepted them. For now, there is no negligent aspect. For those who first receive such certificates from outsiders in the future, thorough investigation should be conducted. While cases with existing real connections are exceptions, even if relatives suddenly come forward when some impediment arises, they should not be accepted. However, when relatives of those who have been accepted come to our locality and make unified petitions in certain matters, that is exceptional. But for people from other places, claims of kinship based solely on the word of their guarantors are absolutely unacceptable. These matters should be thoroughly investigated.

Article 1: While one should not take lightly anything that is announced, if officials regard even instructions from the office as temporary matters, this is a misunderstanding on the part of the officials.

Article 1: Regardless of the matter, petitions from below may attach reasoning even to matters that are arbitrary and without proper basis. Officials should thoroughly discuss and suppress such matters. However, do not officials sometimes cleverly handle even matters without basis, making them acceptable to the office by creating easily acceptable reasoning through consultation and then petitioning? While the petitioners at the time may be grateful for such matters, they become examples for the future, making real matters difficult to resolve and becoming the foundation of disorder. From now on, understanding these matters and being especially careful should be thoroughly communicated.

Article 1: While townspeople are not permitted to kill living beings, recently this has become excessive, so strict instructions should be given to avoid any questionable behavior.

Article 1: It was proclaimed in previous years that people and horses from other provinces should not travel through Edo-machi street, but recently this seems to have been neglected. Both wholesale dealers should be told to strictly instruct cart drivers, porters, and others not to use side roads. Town patrol groups have been ordered to be mindful of this matter and impose fines as soon as violations are discovered.

Article 1: Just because restriction measures are being gradually implemented does not mean one should consider it a tight situation - this would be a misunderstanding. Regarding trade matters, instructions should be given to conduct business prosperously and on a large scale in all things.

○Regarding the rice stored at Akesato warehouse and when rice is transported from Iehisa temporary warehouse to Mikuni warehouse, river boat operators are ordered to load and transport in rotation. However, the sailors have been handling the rice carelessly at their own discretion, and it has been reported that there are excessively light-weight bales when entering the waterway warehouses. This year, strict inspections have been ordered for all warehouses, so if the boat operators continue with their previous practices, various violations may occur. Henceforth, when loading and receiving rice, ensure there are no discrepancies in measurements, clearly mark each bale to avoid confusion, and during transport, sailors must pay attention day and night to prevent damage to rope bales, and most importantly, handle with great care so that not even a grain of rice spills, ensuring safe delivery to Mikuni warehouse. Should there be any negligent handling, strict punishment will be ordered. This matter should be strictly communicated to boat operators, and pledge certificates should be obtained and submitted.　　　　The above should be handled accordingly.

However, since immediate full settlement is difficult, arrangements have been ordered to first settle one-third of this year's procured funds in the form of repayment. Furthermore, regarding interest, as discussed this spring, it should be reduced to one bu uniformly. This time, considering the balance of interest on emergency funds borrowed from various sources, all parties should thoroughly discuss and arrange accordingly.

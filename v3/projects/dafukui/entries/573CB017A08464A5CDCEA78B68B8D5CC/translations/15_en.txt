District Magistrate Tsuchiya Gorodayu
○A farmer named Sensuke from Makinoshima Village under my jurisdiction has been conducting horse trading business for some time, keeping one or two horses for lower-ranking retainers to ride. Since there is a riding ground within his residential compound, he wishes to rent out his horses for small fees to supplement his tax payments. His request has been approved as submitted. This matter should be communicated, and the following separate instructions should also be given:

1. At the riding ground within Sensuke's compound, even low-ranking stipend recipients, minor retainers, townspeople, or farmers may ride as they wish without restriction.
　　However, outside the compound, allowing such low-ranking persons to ride rental horses is prohibited by law and strictly forbidden.
1. It is acceptable for retainers to take horses for long rides or to the Western Riding Ground or Cherry Riding Ground.

1. When retainers' family members go to teahouses, theaters, or any recreational activities, they should be accompanied by chaperones. Each person should be especially mindful.
　　However, as previously ordered, all matters should be conducted without ostentation.

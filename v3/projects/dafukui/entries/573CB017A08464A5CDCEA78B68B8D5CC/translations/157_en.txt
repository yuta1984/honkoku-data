In Edo　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Inspector (Ometsuke)

○It has been ordered that when each person reports for duty during their guard shifts and when departing, they shall bring along the foot soldiers' inspectors (okachiatsuke) and conduct rounds of all public areas including outside the locked entrance, the reception rooms, the main entrance, corridors, and other front-facing areas without exception. This should be understood accordingly. It is essential to greet the guard samurai who are on duty together.
　However, during rounds, if there are damaged areas, it goes without saying, but even if there are unsightly conditions extending to the fixtures and furnishings, after investigation, matters of repair should be reported to the chamberlains.

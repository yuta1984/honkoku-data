　○Every year, preparations for welcoming ceremonies before the lord's return to the domain and repair work have been handled with frugality as has been the practice. However, this year the domain's finances are extremely strained, so even in small matters, further economies should be made and matters should be handled after thorough consultation to avoid any wasteful expenditure.

　○Following last spring's directive, various gifts to retainers have been suspended. However, since everyone continues to serve despite hardship, special consideration has been given to provide individual support. Of course, given the current circumstances, amounts will be reduced from previous levels. Keep this directive in mind.

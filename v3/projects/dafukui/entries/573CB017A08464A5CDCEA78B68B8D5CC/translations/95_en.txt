〇Recently, reports have been heard of thieves, arsonists, burglars and such roaming about various villages. Such persons should be arrested immediately upon discovery. If they resist, handle them forcefully - injuring or even killing them instantly is acceptable. When arrested, there is no need to assign village officials as escorts; write down the detailed circumstances and submit to the office through village channels.

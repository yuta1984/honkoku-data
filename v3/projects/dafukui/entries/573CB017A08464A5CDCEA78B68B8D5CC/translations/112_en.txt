To the Town Magistrate:
1. Regarding merchants from other domains - as before, they are treated as exceptional cases
1. When outsiders have business and there are consultations with local people, with notifications from both parties, regarding lodging - as an exceptional case, they may lodge until their business is completed. However, the number of days should be examined appropriately
1. Those who come claiming to practice medicine or arts shall not be permitted to lodge
   However, those who have been lodging until now must depart immediately
1. Those who fabricate reasons and lodge without proper cause have also been reported - this is improper conduct. If this continues to occur, they shall be reprimanded after investigation
1. Banished persons who were previously granted temporary permission to enter for medical treatment and convalescence must depart immediately
   However, regarding sick persons whose hands and feet are incapacitated, this shall be reported after investigation

○ Regarding the livelihood of Seiganji village: since ancient times they have operated theaters for outcasts and male teahouses, and have served without hindrance to official duties. However, they petition each year about falling into poverty, and though there has been occasional relief, the situation remains inadequate
[Two lines unreadable]

Therefore, out of compassion, sake-serving women were exempted some years ago. However, they exceeded the proper bounds for sake servers, behaving like prostitutes and gradually becoming more presumptuous, appearing to violate the prohibitions, so this was stopped. Later they petitioned for gambling tokens, but this was also deemed inappropriate as it resembled lottery tickets, so it was stopped again. Then, as if they had no means of commerce, they made various petitions that were unacceptable. Village commerce is as described above. However, since times have changed, teahouse business was permitted as requested. Although teahouse business generally follows proper procedures and there would be no need to stop what was once permitted, the serving women were made to act like prostitutes, which was improper for public morals, so it was discontinued. Out of compassion, various arrangements were made for them, but since they themselves exceeded proper bounds and committed improper acts, those who wish to disperse may do so at their discretion and will be handled by the administrative office.

1. Since the village remains unsettled, there may be interference with official duties. The concerns have been communicated repeatedly, and given the circumstances, 65 bales of rice for expenses have been granted, and all previous borrowed money obligations have been forgiven. With this assistance, official matters should be handled well without interference. Should anyone violate this and interfere with official duties, they will be investigated, and if the entire group's attitude is improper, they will all be ordered to disband. Official matters will be consulted upon later.

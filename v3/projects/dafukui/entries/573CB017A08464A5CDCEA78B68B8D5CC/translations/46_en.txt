To the Group Leaders:
○Regarding the river transport of timber donated from various areas for temple reconstruction: as communicated last summer, the regulations newly announced in the fourth year of An'ei (1775), the year of the sheep, must be strictly observed without relaxation. Of course, even for official cargo or cargo from other domains, when passing through our domain territory, one must petition the Mountain Affairs Office, receive an official seal from the Mountain Affairs Office, and pass through with an assigned supervisor. If anyone transports timber by river without proper understanding, regardless of whether it is official cargo, from other domains, or within our domain territory, such timber will be confiscated. Henceforth, there must be no misunderstandings, and these rules must be strictly observed.

To the Magistrates:
○[One line unreadable]
For matters of transport through the territory, if one petitions the Mountain Affairs Office, an official seal will be provided. However, henceforth, if anyone transports timber by river without petitioning the Mountain Affairs Office due to misunderstanding, at that time all timber will be confiscated, regardless of whether it is official cargo or from other domains. Furthermore, regarding control measures, village officials and boat captains must be strictly instructed. Handle matters according to these guidelines.

To the Magistrates:
○Regarding rice delivery to Akesato granary: until now, rice inspection was conducted by members of the advance gun unit, who would examine and assign measuring containers and designate bags according to the delivery amount. From this year, this will be changed so that those selected by lottery according to the delivery amount will handle the measuring containers and bags for examination. Furthermore, regarding the upper tags that have been repeatedly mentioned: continue as before. Regarding the middle tags: henceforth, the names of the deliverers from each village shall be written on middle tags, which shall be brought to the respective granary locations, and after examination by the duty officials, middle tags shall be inserted into each bag. This should be communicated to the granary magistrates.
Additionally, the same procedures shall apply to Mikuni, Matsuoka, Hirose, Ieku, and Edakura.
Furthermore, magistrates should ensure that these instructions are also communicated to the farmers through the deputy officials.

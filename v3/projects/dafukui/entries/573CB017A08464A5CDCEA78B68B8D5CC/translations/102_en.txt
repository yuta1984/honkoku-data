○Regarding requests to adopt children of yoriki (police officials) as adopted sons into the guard units, and the approval of such requests as petitioned: this is as everyone knows. However, while exceptional cases involving specific individuals or unavoidable circumstances may occasionally be petitioned, even when there are no suitable candidates among relatives, since the guard units are large organizations, it should be possible to arrange suitable internal discussions. You are ordered to definitely inform everyone of this point. This should be understood accordingly.
　　However, there are no restrictions on guard units sending adopted sons to yoriki families, and no restrictions on either side regarding daughters' marriage arrangements.

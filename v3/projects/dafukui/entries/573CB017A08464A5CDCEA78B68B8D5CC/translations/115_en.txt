1. When thieves enter the town quarters, the neighborhood watch and others should gather, close the gates, and arrest them, but such actions have not been heard of until now. Ultimately, due to the negligence of the guards, the neighborhood watch system is understood only in name, and because attention to security is lacking, there is no point in posting guards. If town officials, starting with the neighborhood watch, sincerely understand their security duties, security measures will be thorough.
1. Should such incidents occur, arrangements should be discussed in advance for each town district, and methods of arrest should be thoroughly planned in advance so as not to be neglected.
1. When there is no doubt that thieves have snuck into houses, they should be struck down without hesitation. In such cases, it does not matter how they are killed.

While this may appear to be a form of respecting superiors, it is ultimately wasteful. Therefore, even small amounts exceeding the established rules should not be spent on entertainment expenses, and this should be strictly instructed not only to head farmers and village officials but to all farmers. Even if there are no expenses involved, when matters outside the established rules are heard of, after investigating the severity, strict punishment will be imposed, so this point should also be communicated.
　　However, since it is heard that there are misunderstandings among the contractors of the Shibahara water supply, after investigation, if their methods are bound by circumstances, they should be instructed to make strict corrections.
1. Regarding the method documents submitted earlier, inspector group members are to serve and conduct investigations in cooperation with various departments. However, regarding inspector group members, they should be dispatched separately, and all matters should be reported to and received from the inspectors, so this point should be understood.

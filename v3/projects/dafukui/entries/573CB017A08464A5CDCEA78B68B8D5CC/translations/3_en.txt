　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Magistrate
○A copy of the written directive issued by the shogunate to the administered territories is hereby provided. Since the same applies to our own domain, please inform the district administrators to proceed with this understanding.
　　　　　Copy of Written Directive
○Regarding the shogunal territories throughout the provinces: Last year (the year of the sheep) had reasonable harvests, and tax collection proceeded somewhat, but compared to previous collection amounts, there are still considerable shortfalls. That said, there should be no illegal measures that disregard the decline of villages. However, some officials seem to think only that strict collection of annual taxes and various levies would cause hardship to villages. If tribute items are delayed, they naturally get spent, causing difficulties when payment is due later. Therefore, collecting what should be collected promptly is actually better for the farmers. Also, some district administrators or territorial officials may treat their positions too importantly, leaving matters entirely to clerks and subordinates, failing to understand the conditions and sentiment of the villages under their jurisdiction. This is ultimately behavior arising from the arrogance of status, which is outrageous. With such attitudes, natural barriers arise between superiors and subordinates, causing farmers to become neglectful of their work and waste money on useless expenses. This year's barley crop was successful, and in some places very good, so farmers will have sufficient food, which should bring great satisfaction to the authorities. Given this, even greater effort should be made in tending autumn crops, and tax collection should be conducted daily so that from the first payment it surpasses previous years remarkably. If negligent performance is reported, it should be reported immediately. If clerks show immature performance, this constitutes the aforementioned negligence, so dismissal should be ordered immediately. Keep this in mind and work diligently. Note that regarding this year's good barley harvest, there are official instructions concerning tax payment procedures, which are hereby announced.

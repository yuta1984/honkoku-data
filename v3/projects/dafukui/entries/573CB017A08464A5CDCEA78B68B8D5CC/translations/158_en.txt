○Regarding frugality, all departments are being careful, but due to numerous duties, expenses are increasing. Especially this year, with construction and repairs, financial circulation is difficult, so it has been ordered to all departments to avoid further losses
　　　　　　　　First Month, 24th Day　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Town Magistrates
○Regarding the recent impoverishment of the townspeople that has reached our attention, there was an official statement in the previous year of the rat, as was explained at that time. Since then, with continued great fires, the situation will become increasingly impoverished. While there should be no negligence in this matter, as explained in previous years, for all matters that can help people's livelihoods and generally contribute to the prosperity of the townspeople, the yoriki and squad leaders should investigate and report. Furthermore, after examination, an official decision will be made. It has been ordered that this matter should be communicated

Copy of His Lordship's Handwritten Document　　　　　　Monthly Duty Officers
1. Regarding generations, especially through the deep consideration of Lord Tokushōin, Lord Gen'ryūin and we came to this house, and with the intention that house rank might return to ancient times along with various matters, he exhausted his thoughts, and while we have inherited and maintained this intention, we have gradually received excellent commands, and our filial devotion to past generations is unsurpassed. In recent years, due to poor health, there is no need to force myself to work, which I find regrettable. However, being granted the same court rank as Lord Ryūhōin and receiving the command to be appointed to Junior Fourth Rank Lower Grade is deeply appreciated. Regarding court ranks, for those unfamiliar with such matters, they probably cannot appreciate it to the degree that we find it grateful. Moreover, regarding this year's matter, we are again investigating various arrangements for Iyo-no-kami to go to the domain as a representative, and it appears there will likely be no major obstacles. This is truly an exceptional matter without precedent. However, such arrangements cannot continue indefinitely. As I am not yet of an age where returning to the domain would be difficult, and it depends entirely on my condition, my future course is not yet determined in my heart
1. Recently, especially heavy rice loans have been ordered, and truly after long hardship and struggle, payments have been made without delay to satisfaction, though these are matters of great concern. Of course, this is nothing new. Regarding domain affairs, as the land is measured territory, the harvest is thinner than other domains. For generations, finances have been difficult. Since the Jōkyō era, it has been rare to distribute the established stipends as determined. Even to towns and villages, we have long requested financial assistance, barely managing our needs, which is lamentable. The circumstances have been fully reported to the appropriate authorities for their consideration. As the situation of extreme poverty has been reported, we wonder if there might be some measures to be ordered, and though we have investigated and ordered various approaches, things do not go according to our wishes

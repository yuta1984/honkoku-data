〇Regarding the lord's intention to reduce retainers' stipends by half as announced previously, due to financial difficulties, this understanding has not reached the lower ranks properly. If things continue in this manner, it is heard that all will be confused in their understanding, creating a very difficult situation. Therefore, for this year-end, arrangements shall be made according to the principle of half reduction, and for the additional reductions, the respective department heads shall provide loans to cover the difference as ordered. For this year-end, arrangements should first be made accordingly. Furthermore, if next spring the situation in the domain requires the full half reduction to be implemented, the borrowed amounts shall be subject to repayment as will be ordered later. This should be understood and arrangements made accordingly.

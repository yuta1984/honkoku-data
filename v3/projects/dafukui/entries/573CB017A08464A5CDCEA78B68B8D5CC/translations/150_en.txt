...are distinct matters, which has been explained in detail to the district heads. This should also be communicated to the loan office official Mizuno Shinsuke and the head clerks.

Article 1: Regarding the town and rural district heads and group borrowing matters as stated in the attached document, since this has been communicated to the inspectors, following the previous internal approval, application officer Kakehi Yasaemon and assistant application officer Nose Judaifu should handle and manage these matters as instructed. Naturally, Shinsuke should also pay careful attention to ensure there are no obstacles, which should also be communicated.

Article 1: According to previous investigations, there should have been loans of 5,500 ryō, but due to the district heads' petitions, loans were unavoidably made at 8 shu per month interest. Since Yoshida Mozaemon reported that this might interfere with the currency office's previous loans, first 4,000 ryō in loans were ordered, and the remaining 1,500 ryō was entrusted to the head clerk associates at 7 shu per month. This is extremely problematic, but for now they will manage it, and depending on public sentiment, loans will gradually be made to towns and rural areas. Until then, the head clerks should handle this matter well internally.

600 ryō in gold: Joint guarantee loan silver to various groups; 1,000 ryō: Same to town areas
1,800 ryō: Same to three districts (600 ryō each to one district); 600 ryō: Same to Kawakita domain
Total: 4,000 ryō in gold
1,500 ryō in gold: Same to head clerk officials
Grand total: 5,500 ryō in gold

Attached Regulations Document
Regarding adoptions within the retainer group and marriage arrangements for daughters, since His Lordship does not favor arrangements that violate rank distinctions, everyone should be aware of this. However, if there are unavoidable circumstances, it is acceptable to investigate lineage and submit petitions as follows:

Article 1: Yoriki (mounted retainers)
Article 1: Minor officials
For these two categories to arrange adoptions or daughter marriages with guard units, acceptable lineage is:
For adoptions: same family name and up to first cousins of the petitioning person
For daughter marriages: same family name and up to second cousins of the person taking the bride

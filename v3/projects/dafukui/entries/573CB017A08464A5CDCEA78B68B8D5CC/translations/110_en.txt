○Recently, term limits have been established and the policy for financial reconstruction has been gradually announced. However, regarding the fundamental matter of tax collection, which is the primary source for supporting the domain lord's household and retainers, while tax rates have been established since ancient times, in recent years rural areas have been claiming hardship and strongly petitioning for relief. If tax collection continues to decline year after year in this manner, it will be an untenable situation. Of course, villages that face exceptional difficulties and have been thoroughly investigated should receive relief. However, while some relief villages that have received aid once show signs of recovery, which is encouraging, such villages are rarely heard of.

The reason for this situation is that it stems from the negligence of village headmen and officials. Previously, villages in extreme hardship did not receive special relief, but in recent years the policy of village-by-village management has been established. Priority has been given to diligent farming, mutual restraint from extravagance, proper village administration, restoration of tax payment to ancient standards, and conscientious service, and we have heard that some villages have achieved stable conditions.

Therefore, for villages in extreme hardship that have become problematic, district magistrate offices should investigate thoroughly with sincerity, properly instruct the villagers, and work to establish each village one by one - this is the essential matter. It goes without saying that tax collection has been established since ancient times, and except for exceptional crop failures, reducing the tax amount is unacceptable. Generally, from village officials down to small-scale farmers, they do not understand the ancient regulations and mortgage or secretly sell profitable mountain lands, particularly allowing profits to be taken by other domains and villages, making it reasonable that such villages cannot fulfill their appropriate tax obligations. Taking such matters lightly [two lines unreadable]

...should be reported. While there should have been no negligence until now, from now on special care should be taken in handling these matters.

The above points should be thoroughly discussed with the district magistrates.

○His lordship has expressed that financial matters are extremely troublesome and has ordered particularly strict fiscal management from this year. Therefore, although it is burdensome for each of you, you have now been appointed to financial management according to this policy. Accordingly, you are ordered to continue consulting closely and handle matters for the long-term benefit of the domain.

When the above was announced, the acceptance was reported through a written statement, and the details reached his lordship's attention, who found it most appropriate. However, once again with deep consideration, his lordship issued another written order which was presented by the senior retainers on October 2nd, and this matter was accepted and communicated to the officials as well.

Note: The detailed contents of the above written order are recorded separately and placed in the private official document box.

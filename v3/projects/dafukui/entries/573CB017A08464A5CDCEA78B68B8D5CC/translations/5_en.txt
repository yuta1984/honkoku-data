Keep matters extremely simple.
However, during regular gatherings, never engage in any pretentious behavior whatsoever. While there have been previous instructions on this matter, recently things have become loose, and particularly there are many reports of extravagant drinking parties even among lower-ranking officials, which is quite inexcusable. Even when holding gatherings in the future, keep them extremely modest.

1. Generally, for celebrations and such occasions, while close relationships are exceptional, for all others, do not give even the slightest inappropriate gifts or presents. For close relationships, very modest items are acceptable.
Understand the above and strictly observe it.

Direct Personal Instructions　　　　　To All Department Officials
1. Beginning with officials in all departments, strive even more for unity, do not assert personal opinions, abandon private matters for the lord's benefit, and do not leave administrative matters entirely to subordinates. Work with complete dedication to provide thorough and loyal service. Pay careful attention to all matters, and for the lord's benefit and primary duties, apply yourself to the fullest extent of your abilities. In the future, both good and bad conduct will be strictly investigated, so keep this in mind beforehand. His Lordship believes there should be no instances of calculating only immediate gains while failing to consider long-term benefit. Work together closely as instructed. Strictly refuse gifts from those under your authority, townspeople, and peasants. Should there be anyone who accepts such gifts, they will certainly be dealt with severely.

1. Regarding financial matters, His Lordship has issued special instructions to match income as closely as possible to tax collection levels, expressing his earnest intentions step by step. Therefore, all officials and department personnel, regardless of previous practices, should work diligently within their respective departments. When assigned official expenses, postpone what can be delayed, eliminate appropriate portions, and for beneficial measures, without hesitation, report departmental opinions and discussions. Report on methods to reduce necessary departmental expenses. Generally, to ensure no interference with governance and administrative matters, and for the lord's peace of mind through frugality, coordinate closely and work diligently in all areas as instructed.

○Since the year of the Ox, half-reduction rice loans have been ordered for the retainer families, causing great hardship for all. From the year of the Tiger onward, annual loan certificates and silver grants have been ordered. However, while those with five-person stipends or less do not have rice loans, they received similar treatment. This year, allowances were provided based on the standard rate per number of rice bales, but those people were not supposed to receive allowances. Nevertheless, since the same treatment as the allowances up to the year of the Snake was provided, the supervising heads privately petitioned that allowances should continue to be provided this year as well. Upon deliberation, while this matter need not be taken up officially, for this year as a special measure, half the amount based on the standard rate per number of rice bales will be provided as allowances to those with five-person stipends or less, so each should handle accordingly. Furthermore, going forward, since rice loans have been ordered, when allowances are provided, there will be no special treatment, so this should be understood accordingly.
　　　　However, the above matter was also announced to the inspectors for their understanding and handling

○Previously, all outsiders were prohibited, but a written petition was submitted stating that depending on the type, if permission were granted, naturally there would be more workers and the town would prosper, helping people's livelihoods. Upon deliberation and inquiry, it was announced that if it contributes to the town's prosperity, permission may be granted. Of course, it depends on the type, so even if petitions are submitted, they should be thoroughly examined at the local office before being reported. Naturally, if the common people understand this as general permission for people from other provinces, this would be a misunderstanding, so matters should be handled with proper understanding of this intent.
　　However, for sumo wrestlers, puppeteers, acrobats, and skilled performers whose birthplaces are certain and who contribute to the town's prosperity, when there are petitioners, they should be thoroughly examined at the town office before being reported
　　1. Sword-drawing performers, medicine sellers, street entertainers and the like naturally need not be discussed
　　　However, even among such types, if petitions come from temples, depending on the case, permission may be considered after examination

To the Chief Retainer
〇A man named Wakai Tsunezaemon from Shimori Village in the Five Mountains of Tonami District, Etchu Province, has come here because he has connections in our domain. Since this Tsunezaemon has learned the method for producing white saltpeter, he wishes to travel around the rural areas of our domain to teach farmers how to make lye saltpeter. After examination, his request to travel around the villages has been approved. Regarding the final arrangements, the inspectors will report to the gunpowder magistrate. Please understand and handle this matter accordingly.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Inspectors
〇Regarding the above matter, the final arrangements should be conveyed to the gunpowder magistrates as stated in the attached document. Also, the district magistrates should be informed for their knowledge.
　　　　　　Attached Document
1. Regarding saltpeter production, farmers should engage through mutual agreement. Matters that they do not consent to should not be forcibly arranged.
1. Regarding official saltpeter business, there will be further instructions later.
　　However, saltpeter should not be dispersed until official business is determined.
1. When farmers inquire about engaging through mutual agreement, village names, population records, and individual names should be submitted as written reports.
1. Currently, engagement with other domains is prohibited.
1. Great care should be taken regarding fire safety.　These instructions have been given.

　　　　　　　In Edo　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Inspectors
1. Regarding gatherings at both residences during nighttime hours: while early evening is acceptable, if activities extend into late night hours, fire safety naturally becomes problematic. Therefore, as before, night patrol personnel should be instructed that if such situations occur in the future, they should enter without permission for inspection, not only at quarters for lower-ranking personnel but also at samurai quarters. This has been announced, so advance notice should be given to all relevant parties, and night patrol personnel should take sufficient care in conducting inspections.
　　However, regarding the kitchens of the domain residences, since only lower-ranking personnel remain on duty at night, night patrol personnel should also be instructed to enter unexpectedly to check on fire safety and other matters.
1. Night patrol personnel at the middle residence should also patrol the inner back streets within Hachiman Gate as before, paying attention to all matters.
　　However, they should enter through Hachiman Gate and exit through the Tea Garden Gate.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Magistrate
〇Regarding the deferral of various domain debts announced this spring: although there have been requests from creditors in Edo, current deliberation is difficult. However, since this matter has required sustained effort over the years, during the designated period, rice will be sent from the home domain, albeit in small quantities. Therefore, please convey that all matters should be handled with unchanged sincerity and deep consideration, as instructed to Komura Zenpachiro for submission to Edo.

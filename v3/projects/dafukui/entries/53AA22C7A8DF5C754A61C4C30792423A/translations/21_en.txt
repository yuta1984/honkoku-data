Regarding the matter that you would do as I previously requested, I have indeed received and understood your message sworn in writing that this is not false. However, if I go tomorrow and am granted court rank, while it would be very good for me, the more I value this gracious imperial command, the more frightened I become. You also said this is for the sake of the government, the house, and myself. While that may indeed be so in every way, the more I appear and serve, the more I have some misgivings, which I believe differ somewhat from your thinking. There will likely be gossip in society saying my judgment is shallow.

This is what I think inwardly, but I may speak of this matter however without difficulty. In any case, I am firmly convinced that it would be best for all matters if I withdraw as quickly as possible. Ōsumi-dono, I rely on you, so please consult appropriately and handle this matter. You said there would be bad consequences even for you, but it is the same either way. Beyond this, I earnestly hope that my wish will be fulfilled successfully. Regarding Mino-no-kami-dono's kindness, it is truly impossible to express fully with brush and paper. In any case, I rely on you, so please communicate this appropriately. Yesterday too, your visit was most gracious

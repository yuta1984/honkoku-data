I have gratefully read your repeated letters. Regarding the matter of reply, it is quite difficult to express in writing. Now then, I consider your kind intentions to be most fortunate. Tomorrow morning, I will speak to Shirō Gorō and seek your opinion. Though I should come in person to speak with you, I am feeling unwell, so I will convey the details through Shirō Gorō. With fear and respect, I bow my head.

　　　　　　Respectful reply

December 30th: Although he was to have come to the castle on the 27th in response to the summons, he declined due to stomach pain. However, upon recovery, he came to the castle today and had an audience. There were kind words from above, and he was appointed to the rank of Jijū (chamberlain), for which he expressed his gratitude. Upon retiring, it was announced that for New Year's greetings, he would be assigned to accompany others in the White Shoin as in the previous generation's time. After this was completed and upon departing, he made courtesy visits to the rōjū, wakadoshiyori, and Sakai Kawachi-no-kami Tadayuki-dono.
　　However, at this time there was discussion of appointing him to the rank of shōshō (minor captain), but he privately declined this matter, deliberately not wearing the Aoi (hollyhock) crest and using the Kiri (paulownia) crest instead.

On the same day, regarding the above matter, letters were written to the chief retainers including Honda Magotarō Naganori and the castle deputy.

On the same day, regarding the appointment as Jijū, [a letter was sent] from the rōjū to Kyoto Deputy Nagai Iga-no-kami Naoyasu-dono

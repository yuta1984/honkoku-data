Yesterday, I am grateful for your visit. Due to my poor condition, I was unable to receive you properly. Just now, I received various kind letters from Mino-no-kami-dono, for which I am most grateful. Though you instructed me to appear depending on my condition, first my condition is poor, and moreover I have certain thoughts, so I replied that it would be difficult to serve, disregarding propriety. When we meet, I earnestly request that you convey appropriate thanks. As I mentioned the other day, since I am an incompetent person, my failures are dangerous, and moreover my condition is poor, so while I do not properly serve, various gracious

words from above have accumulated, which I find terrifying, so I wish to be pardoned as soon as possible. Please consult well with Ashirō Gorō-dono and grant this, I beseech you, I beseech you. Above.

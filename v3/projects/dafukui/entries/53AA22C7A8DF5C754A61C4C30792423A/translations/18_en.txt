Regarding your private counsel, I find it extremely excessive kindness. These fortunate circumstances and repeated gracious words from above, as Your Lordship well knows, are more than I deserve and I am most grateful. Though this is not something that began now, since I am an incompetent person, I have repeatedly appeared and made mistakes, and moreover with poor demeanor, if I do not properly serve, I believe Echizen-no-kami's intentions would be thwarted. Since these gracious words from above are mounting, I find it terrifying, so I wish to request early pardon. This is not at all said from selfish motives.

Please somehow show understanding and help for the sake of my son.
With great fear and respect
The 28th day of the 12th month
To Inaba Mino-no-kami
Respectful reply

Children of Enma (King of Hell)

Enma:
"I can't bear being this busy! Everyone is asking me to make them my children, but my body feels like it's turning to powder. This must be what they call 'Enma powder'!"

The gatekeepers of the six realms and the street women have all cleverly become children of Enma.

A woman says:
"I was a townswoman, but this year's end brought the expiration of my contract. How can I get used to this journey to the underworld with its temporary pillow? Whether dozing or dreaming, I was crushed before I could even wake up. There's no one to burn me to powder and drink me with water. Please pity this lonely soul, oh Enma-sama."

A blind man says:
"We are a family of five newcomers. Please treat us from now on like your own children and place us somewhere even a little bit better, we beg you."

A child says:
"Papa and mama are children of Jizo. Please make us your children too."

"That mountain of needles over there looks fine, but truly, underneath the needles is terrifying."

After twenty days, it gradually became vast and boundless like a lake,
startling people's eyes. Its breadth, even though in the mountains,
was unparalleled, and since the number of villages was particularly numerous,
I omit details here, but if one possesses maps of Shinano Province or detailed village registers,
one can understand its vastness by examining them. Suffering such
great flood disasters, houses and storehouses drifted in water covering everything,
sank beneath the water debris, farmland was swept away, and mountains collapsed, burying everything in earth.
For example, like Gaunin temple in Nenbutsuji village, which was pushed out by a landslide
and while the entire temple was buried in earth, it caught fire, and when
they dug it out day by day, it had turned completely to charcoal and ash.

Also, like Hakushinan hermitage in Shimosoyama village, rocks collapsed and it was
buried underground, but the resident priest originally knew
where this single building was buried and the location of its remains. Behind Yoshimura village, the mountain collapsed,
muddy water gushed out like a mountain from somewhere, and all the private houses of the village were
completely buried underground. Even after twenty or thirty days had passed,
people and livestock were still being dug out one after another. There are many such
examples, but I omit them here. {{Marginal note: When I was thinking about investigating the details and adding them here, I was troubled and my heart was not at ease, but fortunately there was a published illustrated map of the earthquake. When I obtained and examined this, it was not something that an unlearned person like myself could produce. As I was suffering greatly from an eye disease at the time, I was helped by this illustrated map and fortunately omit the flood disaster paintings here. Even though my work is inferior and the writing is poor, if only this illustrated map were transmitted to future generations, the sentiment of grief might be too thin. Therefore, if the illustrated map and this writing were together, this might serve as a record for future generations. If so, I take up the brush here...}}

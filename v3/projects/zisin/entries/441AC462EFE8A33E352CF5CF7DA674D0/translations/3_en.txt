My own self
fallen like autumn leaves
　　　autumn drizzle on my sleeves—
　　such thoughts
　　　　　indeed
　　　　　Awoo-an

[Left page]
One dawn
when friends had gathered
and afterward
in dreary conversation
about how Zenkoji Temple has
a sacred image transmitted from three countries
people revere it and call it a Buddhist capital
but among these
the constant nembutsu chanting

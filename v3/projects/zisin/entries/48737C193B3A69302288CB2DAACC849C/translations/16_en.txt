A samurai named Sagizaki Tōnai Zaemon from Kamakura came down to Jōshū to see the historic sites of Tokoyo. He rested at a tea house in Onashi at the border between Chichibu and Jōshū. Many other travelers were also resting there, telling stories about famous places, and finding it interesting, he decided to stop by Sano village.

"It's four ri from here. I'd like to hear about the historic site of a man called Sano no Genzaemon from long ago."
"Ah, that's about four ri to the east from here. Please make it tomorrow's business."

Yonohyōe, who guards the historic site of Genzaemon in Sano village, lives pleasantly as in the old days. Tōnai Zaemon comes to this place and stays, receiving various hospitality. "In the time of Saimyōji-dono, we should burn potted trees and served millet rice, but in contrast, since it is summer, we burn miscanthus wood and entertain with delicacies from mountains and rivers."

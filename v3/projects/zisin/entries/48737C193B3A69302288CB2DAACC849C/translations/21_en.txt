What is called Sano no Funabashi (Sano Boat Bridge) is a boat mechanism that spans the Sano River. They hollowed out mountain rocks and passed a large rope through them, tied this to rocks in Sano village, passed corner ropes through, and attached small ropes to the boat. When people boarding the boat pull on these ropes, the boat moves and they can cross to the other side alone. This is called a boat bridge. Also, at this location there are various famous places such as Ikaho Myōjin shrine, Karyu no Miya shrine, and the ruins of Tsuneyo's residence. In the travel scene of Saimyōji that Chikamatsu composed, there are also traces of an old poem that says "Setting out from Sano, with fish as accompaniment." Since there are many matters, I will omit them.

"Perfect timing! I'll give a little scare to this trout that's swum right into my hands.
I'll take this opportunity to finish off that Hinazō fellow too.
Strangling him will be easier than using a fishing rod to catch a small fish."

Eighteen chō beyond here is a village called Yamamoto, which is present-day Yamana. From Sano crossing to the mountain is eighteen chō, and around that time Hinazō had come to Yamana and was frequenting the area. Bazaemon harbored hatred seeing Osano go to Hinazō's place every day. He planted a blade in the middle of the river, and one night when Osano was crossing as usual, he capsized the boat and sank it. Osano was thrown into the river, pierced through the chest, and died in vain. Ah!

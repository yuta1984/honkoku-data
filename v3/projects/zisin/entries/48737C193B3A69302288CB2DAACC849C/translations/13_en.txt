Since Hatori-hime was a celestial being, her beauty was beyond comparison. Kurando, in his excessive affection, would tell stories after discerning the princess's feelings. Originally, Katori-hime was also not an ordinary person, so realizing that the woman who had recently arrived was a celestial being, she increasingly plotted and tested her. At one time, when Hatori-hime revealed the truth and said "Please return my feathered robe," Kurando, wanting to keep the princess in the earthly realm, lied saying "The feathered robe has been pawned to someone, and without a thousand ryō in gold, it would be difficult to retrieve." From this point on, Hatori-hime began to concern herself with raising the money.

Katori-hime had always observed that whenever Hatori-hime raised her hairpin toward heaven and spoke, rain would fall and five-colored clouds would float. One time, when Katori-hime took that hairpin and imitated what Hatori-hime did, rain fell and clouds floated. Then she truly realized and understood that Hatori-hime was indeed a celestial maiden. "I too, equal to a celestial being, have a desire for heaven. In spirit, how could I be inferior to Hatori-hime? We too can summon these pleasant rain clouds."

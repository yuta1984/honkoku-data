Suruga Province's Udo Beach, called Miho no Matsubara (Pine Grove of Miho), is scenery of unparalleled beauty. Long ago, a celestial being descended here, as detailed in the Noh play "Hagoromo" (Feathered Robe). Again in those times, a heavenly maiden descended to this place, and being so delighted by the traces of the past, she hung her feathered robe on a pine tree and wandered about here and there.

Maiden: "Truly, this place is good for consoling my heart and yours. Already the sun is setting behind the mountain ridge. Let us return to heaven."

The fisherman Yomosaku of this place found the feathered robe hanging on the pine tree, rejoiced, and took it home.
"Well, well, what a fine thing is hanging here to dry. If I show this feathered robe to a real wealthy person, it would fetch a considerable price. What a find! However, without this feathered robe, the heavenly maiden cannot return to heaven and must be in distress."

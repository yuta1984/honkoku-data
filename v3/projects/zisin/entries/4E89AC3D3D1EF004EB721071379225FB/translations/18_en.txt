I urgently reported the disaster situation in the villages of Takai and Minochi counties, immediately dispatched assistants and clerks, and personally toured the villages to inspect the disaster conditions. What I witnessed was truly an indescribable and extraordinary transformation that filled me with terror—a sight too horrible to bear. The ground had cracked open in linear formations spanning several dozen ken, with fissures seven to eight sun to five to six sun wide, from which massive amounts of black and red muddy water gushed forth, making many areas impassable on foot. Furthermore, landslides, earth and sand, and snowmelt water burst forth everywhere, large rocks tumbled down, and both rice paddies and fields were completely transformed into wasteland, with extensive damaged land visible. The villages' essential waterways collapsed and were severely damaged in many places, or became misaligned, leaving many areas without water access and cutting off irrigation. In valley streams, large rocks and earth and sand were pushed out and buried the channels, causing collapses and severe damage in various places, blocking water flow and causing overflow onto flat ground with muddy water rushing through. As for the collapsed houses, all of them were

flattened with house rows crushed flat, with rafters and beams separated at joints, ridge posts and other structural elements and fittings smashed, household goods and various tools completely destroyed, and each family's stored grain and other bagged goods scattered in collapse. The erupted muddy water covered everything, and some portions were completely buried under earth and sand. When I first made my rounds, in every village not only the common people but even the village officials had lost their composure, had no idea how to begin cleanup, and each family was helplessly spending their days in bewilderment before their collapsed homes with no shelter from rain and dew.

The injured were also extremely numerous, lying in pain—a situation impossible to fully describe and most pitiful, causing me great lamentation. All villages were in the same condition, and even those who had emergency food supplies found them buried under collapsed houses and covered with muddy water, making them difficult to

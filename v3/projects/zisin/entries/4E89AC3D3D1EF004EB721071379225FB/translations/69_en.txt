On the famine in the Kawakami region




　　　On the ancient great eruption of Mount Asama
Mount Asama in Saku District, Shinano Province, is the largest among the ten northern provinces, and its height is second only to Mount Fuji. It goes without saying that fire constantly burns at its peak and erupts. The center of Saku District is located on the mountain's mid-slope. The elderly sage Keizan states in his "Conversations on Rural Matters" that this mountain is entirely filled with sulfurous vapors, and there are three sources of muddy rivers and blood pools. These are all formed from underground solutions that have congealed, and when stirred, they appear like blood. There are many hot springs at the foot of the mountain: Yunodaira, Dokusui, the hot springs of Mount Mida-ga-take, Waku, Hishino hot springs, and Yama-no-yu - all are products of this mountain's vapors. In a large depression facing Yuwaku, there is a soil called Yachimakuso. When fire is applied to it in spring, it burns.

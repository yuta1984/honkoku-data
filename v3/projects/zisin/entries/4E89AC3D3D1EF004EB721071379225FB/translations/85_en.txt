Rising from beneath the wisteria trees, the waters of the Karasu River were blocked and pushed forward in a flat surge for eight chō, flowing along the riverside south road to the northern basin of Honjō-juku post station, causing enormous damage to rice paddies and fields. The new riverside flowed to the eight-chō riverbank, with dead people and horses lying in heaps upon the mud. Consequently, temples in nearby villages held segaki memorial services and erected large sotoba memorial tablets in various places. From there, the waters broke through the great river, pushed through behind Kumagaya to the Shōten shrine at Manuma, and flowed downstream to Sekiyado. The number of people and horses that flowed away was incalculable. The moat outside Maebashi Castle was filled by the outflow from the Tone River, so orders were given to clear the moat. Sixty-four people were dug out and buried by temple order. The deaths of dogs and horses were countless. In the mud flows near villages around Kuragano, one horse was buried in mud with only its head barely visible and alive, so that horse was dug out. From where stones and sand were excavated, five pieces of nanryō silver were dug up, and three or four buckets and bridges were also excavated.

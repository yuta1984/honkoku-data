retrieve them, and for the lowest-ranking common people who had no provisions for daily food, it was even worse. When they tried to use drinking water and irrigation water, it had become mixed with muddy water, leading to starvation. As this was naturally a general extraordinary disaster affecting all villages with no way for mutual assistance, I provided what emergency food relief I could manage that day, but with over one hundred villages involved, mostly in distant locations far beyond my personal capacity to reach, even those of considerable standing had suffered house collapse disasters, making it impossible to implement extraordinary relief measures. I had no choice but to deploy clerks using grain from village storehouses and emergency reserves to make rounds of the villages to provide what relief possible. For villages closest to the magistrate's office, I had shelters built on the grounds of temples and shrines in Nakano and Matsukawa villages to rescue those in the most desperate circumstances. Furthermore, when I gradually investigated the death and injury of cattle and horses in the villages, the situation was as described in the written report. Additionally, there were over two hundred men and women who had made pilgrimages to Zenkoji Temple, stayed there on the night of March 24th, and suffered losses in fires caused by the earthquake.

This resulted in the loss of many lives, with the disaster-affected villages showing a population decrease of 2 bu 7 rin (2.7%). Of my administrative domain totaling over 58,300 koku, undamaged villages amount to only about three-tenths of the total yield, with the remaining seven-tenths or more being disaster-affected villages—truly a lamentable situation. The immediate need is to repair the irrigation channels in the villages, as without this there will be shortages of drinking water, and since this is the crucial season for rice field irrigation, it cannot be left unattended anywhere. Without repairs, not only will there be problems with rice seedlings, but also with planting in the undamaged fields and paddies. The extensive severe damage makes it quite beyond individual capacity to address. Unlike fire disasters, this is a great disaster that has affected homes, fields, paddies, and mountain forests alike. Particularly in Minochi and Takai counties, the great earthquake was intensely severe, and if left unattended, numerous villages would become places of complete ruin, affecting human lives in the long term and resulting in the loss of tax revenue and national benefit—a situation of no small consequence that requires your

Again, regarding the extraordinary events at the seventh hour on April 13th of this occasion, I report as follows:
As reported in the previous correspondence, the Tanba River could only be crossed on foot, but gradually the water outlet opened little by little, and it became possible to cross with one boat. We felt relieved for a while, but due to landslides, we thought it would be safe as water would not easily flow in large quantities. However, on the 10th of this month, there was unprecedented heavy wind and rain that broke large trees, causing extraordinary devastation. The rainy weather continued,

and the river water increased daily. Due to landslides at Koichi and Sasahara upstream of the Tanba River, an area extending over ten ri to the vicinity of Matsumoto became a lake, creating a scene surpassing even great seas. Everyone was in distress, perplexed daily by the rising water levels. We prayed at various shrines for divine protection from gods and buddhas. We requested the head priest of Suwa Daimyōjin, the primary shrine of this province, to come to Matsushiro (Sanada domain) for prayers. When he performed the ritual, the divine will indicated that the river would clear on the 13th. From the seventh hour until the fifth hour of night, the water completely receded from the entire lake area, returning to the previous normal water level. This was truly a manifestation of divine virtue - how grateful we are for this divine protection, which we announce with even greater reverence. The aforementioned landslide at the water outlet fell into Kawanakajima, but the water did not settle into the Tanba River at all. It became a river covering the entire plain, with a width of approximately three to four ri, and the rushing water completely flooded Zenkōji Temple and the entire Kawanakajima plain, washing away all houses and causing deaths

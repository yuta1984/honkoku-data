but first I report this matter. The above.
　　April 30th　　　　　　　　　　　Sakakibara Shikibu-dayū

Regarding my domain of Matsushiro in Shinshū Province, concerning the great earthquake from the hour of the Boar on the 24th of last month, which I reported earlier as stated, since then it has not ceased and continues day and night countless times with intermittent tremors. On the morning of the 29th and evening of the last day of the month, there were strong tremors three times on both occasions. While distant villages are difficult to assess, in the castle town there are still more collapsed houses, massive rock falls from nearby mountaintops, and regarding the damming location upstream on the Chikuma River that I previously reported, near both Aniwa Village and Yamate-hayashi Village in Sarashina District, half of both ends of the high mountain called Iwakura-yama collapsed and broke away.

The collapse extends about 30 chō in one location and about 5 chō in another, pushing into the river and burying some village areas in the vicinity. However, due to the massive rocks, it appears that the water force cannot break through them, and the river water has accumulated to reach approximately 7-8 jō above normal water levels. As a result, several villages have become submerged, and the area resembles a tidal zone. Of course, I have ordered various countermeasures, but given that it involves a large mountain and massive rocks pushing in, human effort may not be sufficient. Furthermore, the people of Kawanakajima district, fearing that this accumulated water might burst out somewhere all at once, have evacuated to higher ground in the mountains. Tanba-jima post station and others are in the same situation, making it impossible to provide relay horses and porters.
I have ordered various additional countermeasures, but first I report this matter, and will provide details later.

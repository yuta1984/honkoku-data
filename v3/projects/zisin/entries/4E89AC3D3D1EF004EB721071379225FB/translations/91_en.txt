From August, Jōshū (Kōzuke Province) also suffered from poor rice harvests, causing great hardship. Even the landholders along the Hikage-dōri were increasingly struggling with food shortages, and unrest was spreading throughout various regions. The reason for this was that, from the time when grain prices reached one koku or nine to, there were rumors that many people in various places were hoarding large quantities of grain. Consequently, impoverished areas began spreading rumors about making entreaties to those who had stockpiled grain to borrow supplies until the following year, or alternatively, about mobilizing to attack and destroy their properties.

From the night of September 29th, uprisings broke out in Jōshū, and the villages that carried out destructive attacks were in the domain of Ōmetsuke Hisamatsu Chikuzen-no-kami:

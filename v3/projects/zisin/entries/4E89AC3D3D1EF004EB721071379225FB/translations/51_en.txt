Because they were accustomed to such situations, they rushed toward the main hall as their destination, so 521 people were safe. Beyond this, the number of male and female casualties is unknown. Nine people from Edo's Shinagawa post station died.

From there, from Kobushi post station in the eastern part of Takai district to the vicinity of Suzaka castle town, the earth cracked and water gushed forth from the soil. With no way for people to escape, many died. Also, in over seventy villages near Matsushiro castle town in Sarashina district, and from Oiwake, Karuizawa, Kutsukake to the Jōshū entrance, the mountains shook. In addition, in 140 villages west of Takashima village and the castle town area in Suwa district, and in over 130 villages in the northern parts of Saku and Azumi districts, many houses and storehouses were damaged.

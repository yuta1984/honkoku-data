Due to this, while there were no particular problems within the castle itself, damage occurred in various places, with much damage also in the towns and rural areas. Moreover, due to the heavy wind and rain, the rivers rapidly reached full capacity, creating dangerous spots in various locations along the embankments, and it is reported that breaches occurred in several places. Furthermore, since this is the season for rice seedbeds, many villages were affected, and the spring crops were particularly damaged. For distant villages, the situation is still unknown, and naturally, matters concerning embankment repairs, stone baskets, deflecting baskets and their damaged locations, as well as injuries, deaths, and losses of cattle and horses are not yet known. This has been reported by retainers from my domain. While I can provide details later, I first report this matter. The above.

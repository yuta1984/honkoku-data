The earthquake was particularly severe around Zenkoji Temple, with such intense shaking that it was more than just an earthquake - it was violent tremors that collapsed great mountains, buried deep rivers, and caused flame-like phenomena to burst forth from the earth. The palace, treasure houses, temple quarters, and townhouses all collapsed and were crushed without exception. Some sank into the ground, others were struck by massive rocks, and the number of deaths among monks, laypeople, men, women, elderly, and young was beyond counting. Underground fires scattered in all directions at once, burning down all dwellings without remainder. The hardships until the 27th day cannot be fully described with brush and paper. From here northward, through Ōmine, Kurohime Mountain, Togakushi Mountain, Agematsu, Kitago, Shinkoji, Fukuoka, Ueno,

Saijo, Yoshimura, Tako, Hirate, Hoii town, Kitahira, Rakuei, Kotaka, Otaka, Kashiwabara, Shiojiri, Hyakukawa, and the checkpoint area of Sekigawa to the castle town of Takada in Echigo Province - the shaking began on the 24th, and around noon on the 29th it was particularly strong, toppling storehouses, temples and shrines, and private houses. Great mountains collapsed burying fields and rice paddies, rivers overflowed causing great floods that swept everything away, and there were numerous dead and injured. Particularly in the small village called Nagasawa, sixty to seventy people died, all buried in earth with only their hands and feet visible. From the temple eastward through Gondō, Iwama no Gosho, Naka no Gosho, and Araki - over a hundred villages in this area suffered particularly severe damage. At Obasute Mountain, as if truly now parents abandoned children and children searched for parents while falling into the great earth, blinded by flames, as the ground split open spewing mud.

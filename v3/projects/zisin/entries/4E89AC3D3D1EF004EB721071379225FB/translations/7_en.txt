By dawn there had been approximately eighty or more earthquakes. The next morning it became somewhat quieter, but even now the tremors have not ceased. In the villages of Minochi District under my jurisdiction, there were reportedly collapsed houses, injured and dead people, but no reports have been submitted yet. As I gradually hear rumors about the situation, it appears that the area from Kawanakajima in the same province to Zenkōji temple, and further south to the area called Yamanaka—a village district—was particularly severely affected by earthquakes. Around Kawanakajima, either entire villages of private houses or more than half were shaken down, and furthermore, some villages were completely burned down by fires, with immediate deaths and injuries ranging from thirty to forty people to two or three hundred people per village. In the towns of Zenkōji, virtually all the rows of houses were shaken down, and furthermore burned down, with massive immediate deaths and injuries. Along all the highways, due to the Buddhist memorial services at Zenkōji temple at this time, many travelers were staying together, which is why there were also many deaths.

The mountainous areas are remote and difficult to reach, so the situation there is hard to determine, but upstream on the Sai River there were landslides that blocked the river flow, completely stopping the flowing water, causing the ferry landing at Tanbajima to dry up so that people could cross on foot. As for the situation in Echigo Province, I do not know how it is, as the circumstances are unclear. The above is only based on rumors and cannot be confirmed for certain, so I will immediately dispatch my agents to inspect and investigate the collapsed houses and other damage in my jurisdictions, and also investigate the losses in nearby villages, reporting the details later. Also, regarding the villages of Saku District in the same province attached to the magistrate's office under my custody, although they experienced the same great earthquake at the same time, perhaps because they are separated by several ri from the Zenkōji area, the damage appears less severe—the magistrate's office, jurisdictions, and other nearby villages under my private domain had only minor damaged houses

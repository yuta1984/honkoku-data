Thus, in the darkness so profound that valleys and peaks could not be distinguished, slipping on water and stumbling on stones, people barely escaped with their lives, crossing mountains for over three ri barefoot. The falling stones were about one shaku in size, all glowing red-hot, and when they hit the ground they shattered and burst into flames. At the western end of Karuizawa, thatched roofs caught fire, and fifty-six houses on the south side were burned down, but no one could fight the fires, leaving the area like a spring burn-off field. People finally returned to their homes around the thirteenth day. Farmers in villages within a ten-ri radius stopped working their fields and could only gaze at the smoke. Large stones fell westward from within the smoke like flying birds. Mugen Valley was filled and became a mountain higher than Mount Maekake. Since all the smoke drifted toward the northeast, stone and sand fell in Shinano Province.

East of Kutsukake, using Mount Hanare as the boundary, the fallout extended eastward. Around the Hour of the Monkey (3 PM), from the Hirao area to Hiraga and Ōhinata, all along the mountain routes, a small amount fell. The river east of Kutsukake is called Yugawa, and small burned stones flowed in this river, making the water invisible. The color was white and strange as hair. The water was black with sand, and remained unclear even after the year passed. Stone and sand accumulated over four shaku deep in Karuizawa. At Shakushi-machi on Usui Pass, it was over five shaku deep, reaching the eaves of houses. Gongen Shrine was unharmed, but one house each at the eastern and western ends of the mountain teahouses was destroyed and buried under roof stones, becoming level ground. The sand was five to six shaku deep. At Sakamoto post town, it was over four shaku deep and houses collapsed. At Mount Myōgi it was about one shaku four sun, at Yokokawa one shaku five sun, and at Matsuida two shaku.

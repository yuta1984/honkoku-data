We managed to pass through areas where the ground had split, and the retainer of Lord Hida-no-kami also continued his departure. However, from the mountainous area of Shiozaki Village, large crowds gathered with loud voices, surrounding the retainer. Among them were those separated from their parents and those separated from their wives and children, who pleaded for help and cried out for food to be given to them. The local magistrate and other clerks were called over to gradually explain the situation and arrangements for relief measures, and they were finally persuaded to disperse.

With no immediate lodging available, we camped outdoors for two days and two nights before finally leaving that area. The territorial lord should arrange for temporary shelters to be built and sent word to calm the people. We had originally gone there intending to begin reconstruction work, but ended up returning partway.

This great earthquake is said to have affected an area of ten ri in all directions from that location, but the areas most severely affected were five to six ri from north to south, and twelve to thirteen ri lengthwise. Other areas likely experienced nothing particularly severe. We departed Shiozaki Village, crossed the Chikuma River, and after one ri reached Yashiro-shuku in Matsushiro domain, where only a few houses had collapsed—about three—and there were only twelve to thirteen immediate deaths. The ground cracks appeared finer and lighter compared to the Shiozaki Village area.

From there, two and a half ri to Komoro town, then three ri to Oiwake-shuku, there was nothing as severe as mountain rumbling, and after the earthquake there were only occasional

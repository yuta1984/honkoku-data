up to this point, remaining as they were upon arrival. The palace buildings collapsed from the shaking, and fire spread from within them instantly. Not only the ritual implements and treasure repository, but also various documents and account books could not be carried out in time, and all were completely burned. Though I speak with reverence,
the sacred memorial tablets enshrined in the Spirit Hall were barely carried out and safely protected, so please be at ease. The fire still has not been extinguished, and we are all in deep sorrow. The definitive details regarding deaths and other disturbances are not yet known, so please hear the full details from this messenger. Hastily, the above.

In Iga-no-kami's domain in Shinano Province, from around the hour of the Boar on the 24th, due to earthquakes, houses in Inari Village in Sarashina District collapsed from the shaking. Fire broke out from those collapsed houses, devastating and burning the entire village, making it impossible to provide post-horse relay services. In Chiisagata District as well, there were collapsed houses and damaged areas, deaths of people and horses. Even on the 26th, tremors continued intermittently, according to reports from local officials. I will report the details later, but since Inariyama Village is a post station, while Iga-no-kami is in Osaka, I report this matter.

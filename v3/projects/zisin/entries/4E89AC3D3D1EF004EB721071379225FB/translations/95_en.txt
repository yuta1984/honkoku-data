They scattered these throughout the inn district, destroyed Fujiya Shōbei and Izumiya Yazaemon, then attacked Gyoryōba Shichizaemon. When everyone searched for clothing but could not find any, they heard it was in the storehouse of Kindaiji Temple, so they all rushed there and pulled out twenty to thirty medium-sized wicker trunks, tearing apart all the clothing. They then attacked Jinemon, and at his sake shop brought out all the sake to the garden, filled large tubs with it and drank. Each person took wooden ladles and tea bowls and poured the sake into their own bellies. However, at this time there were no prohibitions on sake brewing or talk of grain hoarding, so if there were no issues, they would withdraw without incident. From there they pressed on to Mitsuzuka. This was in the grain district of Matsudaira Iwami-no-kami's territory, where they destroyed two establishments: Seki Hachiemon and Kabei, and also Kanzaburō.

At the sake shop they drank heavily, slightly damaging the sliding doors and screens. This was because many people became very drunk from the sake at both locations. From this point their violence intensified, and they again rioted, seizing clothing and committing outrages. From there they advanced to Kami-Sakurai under Daikan Endō Hyōemon's jurisdiction, destroyed Kaibara, and in Naka-Sakurai destroyed Jirōbei and Sadaemon. Then around evening of the third day they pressed on to Shimogata, attacked Zenbei, seized his gold, silver and clothing in disorder, carried his household goods to the garden and burned them. They destroyed Sōkichi, destroyed Heikichi, set fires and burned everything. Two houses were destroyed by the spreading fire. From there they proceeded to Omayose in the territory of Makino Tōtōmi-no-kami, destroyed two grain dealers - Giemon and Tomiemon, and in Hara-Shinden Nakahara [attacked] Tsunemon and Genshirō.

Buzaemon, Tōbei (a yamabushi practitioner), and the annual administrator of Hokkeidō were targeted, and their residences were destroyed. While there was no talk of hoarding, they had much gold and silver, lent money to merchants, and were resented for buying up grain. Now, as for the appearance of the bandits: they smeared their faces with soot, and these ragged people carried axes and large hammers, tearing apart paper banners which they held at the front. Those who appeared to be leaders wielded command batons giving orders, and completely destroyed household goods. Besides these, five establishments including Kakubei and Seiuchi were destroyed. They beat drums and blew conch shells, using battle cries as signals to begin destruction, and when bells were rung as signals to withdraw, the rear guard became the vanguard, having local people carry banners to guide them. From there they proceeded to Shiga Village under the jurisdiction of Daikan Endō Hyōzaemon, and destroyed the establishments of Heiemon, Kichibei, and Daijirō.

Around the time of Shinome they went out to Uchiyama, completely destroying the households of Jirōemon, Bunzō, and Mankichi without leaving anything. When they went out to Hiraga, it was the fifth hour of the third day. They destroyed three establishments: the pawnbroker Uemon and Heisaburō. Then they went out to Shimonaka-hen in the territory of Naitō Shima-no-kami, attacked a Zen temple called Shugetsuin, completely destroying the main hall and kitchen quarters. Besides this, they destroyed three locations including Kisōji and Den-hachi, then went out to Nozawa. Previously, they had sent messengers to Ikeda-ya Seijirō in Hara Village, saying that they would provide cooked rice from straw bags. They gathered many pots and kettles, cooked twenty bags of rice, and a large crowd pressed in to eat this. From there they thoroughly destroyed Sumiya Jinemon, taking out even tea bags from the storehouse.

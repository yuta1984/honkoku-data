Around Zenkoji, it calmed down a little on the morning of the 25th. Matsushiro and the Echigo route were particularly strong on the 25th, 26th, 29th, and the last day of the month, shaking day and night. Through special arrangements by the deputy officials and local lords, water and fire were prevented, and through their compassion, rice and money relief was provided - to say this was grateful would be quite inadequate.

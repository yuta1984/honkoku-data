Last month of March　　　　　　　　　　Takagi Seizaemon

Report of April 3rd
In my domain of Matsushiro in Shinano Province, from the hour of the Boar on the 24th, two days ago, due to a great earthquake, residences within the castle, turrets, and surrounding walls etc. were severely damaged. Many houses collapsed in the retainers' residences, castle town, domain villages, and other jurisdictions under my control, with numerous fatalities. Particularly in the villages there were also fires, and furthermore in the mountainous areas, mountains collapsed and were pushed into the Sai River, causing water to accumulate and gradually reach full capacity. Naturally there is no water at all, and the ferry landing at Tanbajima post station on the Hokurikudō highway has dried up completely. Depending on how this overflow water pushes out, it is impossible to calculate what kind of flood disaster might occur. Even now it continues to shake from time to time. I will report the details later, but first I submit this report on the matter.

In Nakanojō village in Shinano Province, the structure and walls of my magistrate's office were shaken down in various places, and other nearby farmhouses with weak sections and lower house areas were also shaken down. After violent shaking continued for a while, it finally stopped. From then on, with small intervals, the shaking continued incessantly, and there was a sound like thunder coming from the north direction of the magistrate's office, and when dawn broke

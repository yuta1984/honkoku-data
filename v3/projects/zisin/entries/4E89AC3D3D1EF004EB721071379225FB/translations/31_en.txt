The three post stations of Kawada-juku and Fukushima-juku on the secondary highway cannot provide relay horses and porters due to the aforementioned circumstances. Regarding rice and grain in riverside villages, we had previously ordered their evacuation and transport to mountain villages, but in other nearby villages, believing that even if water came rushing in, there would be no loss, they had constructed shelves and stored grain and houses on them—not a few of these were all swept away together.

Due to this, we dispatched officials to various locations for village relief, ordering food distribution and the construction of temporary shelters. Particularly in the Kawanakajima villages, three irrigation weirs that drew water from the Sai River, plus one water gate at another location, were completely buried without a trace. With no drinking water available whatsoever, even for cooking relief food, water must be carried from distant locations—some as far as thirty chō away.

Ultimately, regarding the aforementioned embankment construction, wanting to prevent such situations and for emergency defense, even people from villages whose houses had collapsed in the earthquake worked diligently day after day building up the defenses without waiting for orders. However, all this effort was in vain as everything was destroyed in an instant. Those who suffered house loss, flooding, and other damages are naturally at a complete loss, and everyone is in despair. Not only daily drinking water but also the immediate tasks of drawing water to rice seedling beds and weir construction cannot be promptly accomplished, creating inevitable obstacles and causing great unrest among the people, which is extremely worrying.

We are focusing on relief efforts, but with damage to the castle interior and samurai residences, countless collapsed houses and casualties in the castle town and domain villages, ground fissures in fields and roads, floor displacement, mountain collapses and landslides—these great disasters continue, along with this flood disaster. Moreover, the rumbling and shaking still do not cease, creating an extremely worrisome situation that causes us great anguish. We will investigate and report details in due course, but for now, we first submit this report.

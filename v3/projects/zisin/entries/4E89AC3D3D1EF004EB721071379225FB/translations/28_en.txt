Although it was a flood disaster, around the fifth hour of the morning on the same day, the river water level appeared to begin receding, and the inland water also showed signs of dropping somewhat. We do not know how the water levels will fluctuate from here, but since nearby villages have also been reporting on the flood situation one after another, we believe there has been substantial damage overall to villages along rivers under our jurisdiction as well as to interior villages. We will report details later. Regarding Seizaemon, he was currently making rounds to disaster-affected villages around Akanuma in Minochi District when both the river courses and main roads became flooded and impassable. Since he is away, we first report this matter urgently through those left behind. The above.

Regarding the earthquake that occurred on the night of the 24th of last month in Shinano Province, territory of Iga-no-kami, we had previously reported this matter. At that time, a massive landslide occurred upstream on the Sai River, blocking the river course, and water had been accumulating to a depth of several tens of jō. On the evening of the 13th, around the seventh hour, it burst through all at once, and water rushed into the entire Kawanakajima area. In Imazato Village and Nakahigakanna Village within Sarashina District, rice fields and private houses were swept away, or muddy water rushed into houses. However, the stored rice will likely be unusable. In other villages, although houses were not swept away to that extent, water covered all the rice fields. By dawn of the following 14th, the water gradually began to recede, but due to the sudden flood, there may have been drowning deaths of people and animals. Moreover, local officials have reported that extensive property loss and land damage are expected to occur. We will report details later, but we first report this matter.

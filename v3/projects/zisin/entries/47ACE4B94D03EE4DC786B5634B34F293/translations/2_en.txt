There is no need for you to trouble yourself by coming here, so please return home promptly and await developments there. However, I will arrange for the ships to complete their work quickly and proceed directly to Izumi and Sendai. After that, since there is a shortage of ships for Edo official use, please convey this matter clearly to the ship captains.

Since delays have led to this situation, please consult with Seizaemon-sama and report the matter so that no inconvenience arises with the official authorities.

After this current matter is settled, before the autumn regulations for official ship allocations are determined, I believe it would be most convenient if you could visit our locality once more and make some proposal. I intended to send a reply by express messenger, but I have arranged through Okabe for assistance from Mr. Tokuda, and being quite busy, I have written this hastily with rough penmanship. I await your future correspondence. Respectfully submitted.

From Kagoshima
Written on the 29th day of the 4th month of the Rabbit Year - Yamamoto Sōbei  
At lodgings in Katakata
To Ishimaru Zensuke-sama

Postscript: The separate document has not reached Mr. Koide, so please kindly convey this to him. Recently, when inspecting all the products at the Yamadoko logging site in Hyuga, the supervisor inquired about the ash markings, and I responded rather vaguely and appropriately on the spot. As you all generally know, this differs from official procedures, but since it cannot be undone now, please consult with Kume-sama and proceed with internal discussions as deemed appropriate after investigation. At present, this matter shows no sign of hindering charcoal production in any way. Either way, once this is settled, everything should work out well. Though it may be presumptuous of me, I hope both gentlemen will make appropriate decisions.

Regarding the items you ordered, Zensuke-sama, since our local supply was exhausted until this spring, I specifically placed an order with Ryukyu, so they should definitely arrive here by the sixth month, and I can then arrange shipment. I regret this delay, but please understand that I will be able to report on this soon. As for lower-grade items, we always have some available, but these are complimentary (text incomplete)

Respectfully

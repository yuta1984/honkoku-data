Therefore, all have the intention to remain peacefully in their places.

The prefectural official instructed the island officials, saying: "Should the mountain fire approach people's residences, evacuate them by ship to Toshima or Niijima. <<Note: This refers to an island separate from Niijima village within Oshima>> They may also go to Shimoda port in Izu province, Inatori village in the same province, or Misaki bay in Sagami province. Even if winds carry them to other ports, this shall not be prohibited. Urgently report to Edo by express messenger as convenient, and to Nirayama magistrate's office as well. Do not allow exiles to leave the island, and make good plans for securing food supplies." <<Note: From Oshima to Toshima is 42 ri, to Niijima 60 ri>> <<Note: To Shimoda about 108 ri, to Inatori 48 ri, to Misaki 108 ri, to Edo 216 ri. In the island's Niijima and Okada villages>> <<Note: These two villages currently have 5-6 large ships and over 30 fishing boats>>

First question: With over 2,000 men and women on the island and only twenty cargo ships, in case of emergency, would it be possible to obtain convenience for advance and retreat? Answer: As already responded in the previous item, the two villages have the barrier of Yorikoshi mountain separating them from the mountain fire. Should the three villages face urgency, their people would simply be moved to the two villages. Even if road passage becomes difficult, with the remaining 5-6 cargo ships, transport to the two villages would not be difficult. Plans have already been discussed with the islanders.

Second question: Would the regular ships traveling between Oshima and various ports of Edo encounter no obstacles even during this fire emergency? Answer: Of the twenty island ships, fifteen or sixteen transport firewood and trade in grains, traveling to various ports of Edo with traffic as frequent as weaving. What difficulty could there be in passage? Moreover, those constantly at the island port number 5-6 ships as previously answered, and dozens of fishing boats can also be used for unforeseen circumstances.

The above represents the dispatch of a prefectural official to meet face-to-face with island officials under orders from the great magistrate's office. He also reported: "The island fires are gradually being extinguished. The crater's smoke continues day and night, but the valley fires have generally died out. Smoke can still be seen at Akasawa, but

Earthquake Records - Ansei Year of the Wood Rabbit, 10th Month, 2nd Day

Without encountering great disasters and calamities, one cannot know true reverence and vigilance. Only when the earth splits and houses burn do the complacent learn of loss and the idle become motivated. In the early night of the tenth month of this year, around the second watch, suddenly the great earth roared and surged. Millions upon millions of homes became like rotten soil, crumbling apart at the slightest touch. The front of halls could not be seen, only their backs were visible. Broken pillars became firewood, piling up like kindling. Warning bells rang continuously and fires broke out on all sides. Heaven and earth were like molten metal, glowing red-hot. Even high officials walked on foot, not seeking horses. Escaping alive was already difficult, let alone extinguishing fires. The disaster's aftermath reached the ponds, turning many fish red. Remaining flames entered the palace, leaving roof tiles reddish-brown. Ears heard the sounds of running feet and collisions; eyes saw corpses lying piled upon one another.

I have heard that in the Meireki fire, deaths exceeded one hundred thousand. I have also heard that in the Genroku earthquake, the great castle's bridge planks were severed. In this year's disaster, human deaths number two hundred thousand, and castle collapses occurred in many places. The great earthquake and great fire together became one great affliction spanning two hundred years. Additionally, I observe that last year the eastern sea overturned and the eastern land split. Fields extending hundreds of ri were half submerged. In the five provinces of Sagami, Izu, Suruga, Tōtōmi, and Mikawa, the people's strength was exhausted and their wealth depleted. Alas, what hardships can we small people speak of? I only wish that the patriots of the realm would open their sorrowful countenances. Chao You never discussed economics, yet naturally Kui and Long take their places in the court ranks. I venture to speak beyond my station for the sake of family and nation, like an old man tying grass in gratitude. Breaking precedent is precisely what the times require for salvation. The treasury need not necessarily fall into depletion. Do you not know that in the second year of King You of Zhou, a great earthquake extended to the three rivers? This was when yang was not...

On the 18th day of the 9th month, fire erupted at Aka-sawa, and on the 26th day it erupted at Chiri-sawa. Even now, the fires at these two ravines, Aka-sawa and Chiri-sawa, continue to burn fiercely. Previously, following orders from the main government office, prefectural historians questioned the island officials, and the questions and answers were as follows:

First question: What is the current state of the island fires, and which village is most severely affected? Answer: The great crater measures half a ri from east to west and two ri and sixty steps from north to south. Its interior is pitch black and unfathomably deep - even island residents who are ordinarily accustomed to treacherous terrain cannot fathom its depths. Throughout the island, the crater is revered and called Mihara Daimyōjin, serving as the island's principal shrine. In Tenna 4, year of Kinoe-ne, fire erupted within the crater. Though it varied in intensity, it did not extinguish for seven years, finally dying out in Genroku 3, year of Kanoe-uma, according to oral tradition. However, on the 29th day of the 7th month last year, fire erupted within the crater, and since then it has also varied in intensity but has not extinguished to this day. The fire at Nakano-sawa has already been extinguished, but Aka-sawa and Chiri-sawa still burn with flames. Smoke from within the crater continues to rise in thin wisps without cease, but the damage from sand and ash does not severely reach the villages. Generally speaking, the closest fire outbreak sites are nine ri from people's homes, while the farthest are eighteen ri away.

Second question: With Nakano-sawa and Aka-sawa already erupted and Chiri-sawa also in flames, if the three fires burn fiercely at their respective locations, wouldn't transportation to and from villages be cut off, making mutual assistance impossible? Answer: On the 22nd day of the 3rd month of this year, the northwestern ridge of the crater collapsed in flames, fire descended to Naka-sawa, and reached the east of Izumi-tsu village where the fire stopped. This is a path for gathering firewood, located about three ri from people's homes. On the 18th day of the 9th month, the southwestern hill of the crater collapsed in flames and fire descended to Aka-sawa. Aka-sawa lies between the two villages of Nomasu and Sashikiji, about six ri from both villages. Since the fire in the ravine shows signs of gradually dying down, roads to the lower ravine and seashore are already passable, allowing mutual assistance throughout the island. On the 27th day, fire descended from the northeastern hill of the crater to Chiri-sawa and the rocky shore, where charred stones buried the sea for about sixty steps in length and six hundred steps in width, rising five to six steps above sea level. Smoke can still be seen rising from the seashore. This location is

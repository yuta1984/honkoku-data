Also, well water suddenly becoming muddy or gushing forth is a sign of earthquakes. [marginal note: The above is from "Tenmon Kōyō"]

It is also commonly said that clouds appearing closer is a sign of earthquakes. This is not actually clouds, but qi rising upward that appears like smoke or clouds.

The Japanese name for earthquake is called "nai." In the "Wakan Sansai Zue," it appears as "nahe," which would be an appropriate kana rendering of "nai."

According to the theory of Kitaka-ō, "na" refers to fish, and "i" is a contraction of "yuri" (shaking), making it "naiyuri." Perhaps it became a term describing the swaying motion like a fish moving its tail fins.

"Ifuru" seems like a redundant expression, but since "nai" has become a noun, it should be acceptable. Thinking about this, although it is truly a childish folk belief, the idea that a great catfish lives beneath the earth is also a folk saying passed down from ancient times.

Also, on the cover of a calendar from the 9th year of Kenkyū (1198), there is a drawing of an "earthquake insect" with the names of Japan's sixty-six provinces recorded. Though it may be folk belief, since such things existed six or seven hundred years ago, perhaps the catfish theory also has some basis in written sources. Buddhist teachings also attribute it to the actions of dragons. Ancient theories were generally of this nature.

○In Sado Province, people still commonly use the expression "naifuru" (earthquake shaking) today.

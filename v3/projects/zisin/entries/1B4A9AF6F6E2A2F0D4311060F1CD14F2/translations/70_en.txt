　　　　We respectfully submit this written report
The acting head of the 2nd Large District, 9th Small District respectfully reports: From around 3 PM on the 12th day of the current 3rd month, in the direction of Mount Shirane toward the west-northwest, continuing from Mount Chūgūshi in Nikkō, the sky suddenly appeared like sand and smoke. Amid this, loud sounds reverberated through heaven and earth, sand began falling, the smell of sulfur was intense, and people were filled with fear and awe. However, around 9 PM on the same day, the sounds and falling sand finally subsided, and everyone felt relieved. Nevertheless, smoke from the direction of Mount Shirane appeared like flowers - an unprecedented and remarkable event. We will conduct an on-site inspection and submit detailed reports, but we urgently submit this preliminary report.

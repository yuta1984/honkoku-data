Postscript to "Considerations on Earthquakes"

Among natural disasters to be feared, none is greater than earthquakes. Even if the earth splits, mountains collapse, seas tilt, and rivers overturn, one cannot fly away to heaven to escape. However, regarding the records in ancient and modern chronicles and recent changes in our nation, even when buildings collapse, walls fall down, and people and livestock are injured, people generally view these incidents with detachment, treating them merely as curious tales. Only after actually experiencing such events firsthand—having one's heart shaken and soul startled—does one begin to reflect on those times and understand that they are truly fearsome.

Here, on the second day of the seventh month of Kōin (Bunsei 13, 1830), there was a great earthquake in the capital region, and aftershocks continue to this day without ceasing. People's hearts are in turmoil, saying that if earthquakes become even more severe, how could they possibly escape? The rumors among the people are also extreme—some say the earthquakes will be most severe on certain days and times, others say certain events bring curses, and still others say violent storms and earthquakes will come together. Combined with warnings about the Hinoe-Uma disturbances, people don't know where to turn. Some have even gone so far as to abandon their occupations, forsake their duties, and flee with their families to distant places away from earthquakes.

Master Tōzan, growing more sincere with age, took pity on this situation and recorded these words to enlighten the people's hearts and dispel their confusion. Therefore, he did not embellish his language, nor did he strive for extensive scholarly verification. The Master of Tōryō received this work, expanded upon it, and planned to carve it in woodblocks for publication, requesting that I record the circumstances.

It happened that someone explained to me, quoting their ancestor's words: "Household implements that can prepare for earthquakes do exist here and there today, but people do not fully know their proper use. These were devised and explained after the great Hōreki earthquake, but after the great fire of Tenmei, people no longer knew that earthquakes were to be feared. Today's construction shows only preparation for fires. This is probably because they did not personally experience the Hōreki earthquake, so their consideration does not extend that far. How swift is the change in people's attitudes!"

Therefore, I record this alongside, hoping that people will learn from similar cases, develop lasting vigilance, learn from experience, and be prepared.

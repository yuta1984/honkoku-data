Iron vapors accumulate and steam in the mountain soil, battling with sulfur to produce fire. During the Hōei period, fire erupted on Ōshima, and the following year Mount Fuji had a great eruption. The volcanic ash from both fell on the provinces of the Tōkai region, melting stones and creating tumultuous conditions that formed protuberances. This became Mount Hōei. By observing this, one can also deduce and understand other phenomena. Tei said:

In the winter of Meiwa Teii year, I was in Izu Province, recuperating from illness at Atami Hot Springs. One day while boat touring to Hatsushima Island, the island chief Shindō Hachirōbei pointed out what are called the seven islands belonging to Izu Province. Miyakejima and Hachijōjima were so distant they could not be seen. He then said, "Last year divine fire erupted in several places on Miyakejima, and the islanders could not live peacefully. Around the sixth and seventh months, they fled by ship across the sea toward Hachijōjima. Among them, several dozen vessels encountered storms and drifted, mooring near Manazuru Point. When I passed the point on my return journey, I witnessed disheveled men and women, some in groups, some in pairs, all speaking of the disaster of the island fire." Three years later, on the twenty-eighth day of the seventh month of Kōin year, fiery vapors rose straight up from the northern sea, reaching a height of several dozen fathoms and a width of several hundred steps.

It began at sunrise, and for a while over ten peaks of flame pierced the sky in blue-red color, with circular lights flying chaotically between the columns. It arose at the Hour of the Rooster and dispersed at the Hour of the Ox. This was an unprecedented phenomenon for us. Another three years later, from the twenty-ninth day of the second month to the third day of the third month of Jinshin year, there was a great fire in the Eastern Capital, and most of the forty-ri metropolis became scorched earth. It was fortunate that both imperial palaces escaped disaster. The following year, on the second day of the eighth month of Tsuchinoto-Mi year, in the early evening, the southwest wind was fierce, completely toppling mansion walls and fences. Fires broke out in dozens of places, with fires visible from one to another. In lands hundreds of ri outside the capital, castles and buildings collapsed and large trees were uprooted. Now again fire has erupted on Ōshima, and though the Eastern Capital is four hundred ri from the island, we can still see the residual flames day and night. Sometimes earth tremors continue for several hours, and those on night duty at the Eastern Capital's castle stay awake all night in wonder. The intensity on the island can be imagined. Our domain's capital is small, not even twenty ri square, barely comparable to the city of Osaka, yet this year there have been dozens of accidental fires, which is also quite rare. Thus, looking at the events before and after

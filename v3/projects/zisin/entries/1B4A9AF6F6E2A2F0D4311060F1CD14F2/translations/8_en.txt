Do you not see how Yu's floods and Tang's droughts were also Heaven's calamities, yet they turned Heaven's heart around and brought about auspicious signs? What is needed now is simply the means to mend Heaven. Surely there must be ways to transform disaster into blessing. Ah, surely there must be ways to transform disaster into blessing!

According to what Imoto Gyōken records: Mayuzumi was a famous courtesan of the Sanotsuji pleasure house on Shin-Yoshiwara street. Initially called Akane, she was separated from her parents at merely two years of age and raised by others. At eight years old, she was sold into a brothel. Her master was very upright. When she matured, her beauty bloomed brilliantly, causing all who saw her to be entranced and bewildered. On the night of the second day of the tenth month of Ansei 2 (1855), year of the wood rabbit, at the second watch, a great earthquake struck the Kantō region, and Edo suffered tremendously. Buildings collapsed, fires broke out afterward, and disaster spread elsewhere. Those crushed to death like fish numbered in the tens of thousands. The government erected temporary buildings to house the poor, saving them from hunger and exposure. Those who received this benevolence numbered several thousand. Hearing of this, Mayuzumi sold her hair ornaments, obtained thirty gold pieces, purchased over 1,060 cooking pots, and distributed them within the temporary shelters. Her intention was both to potentially encounter the parents from whom she had been separated in childhood and to pray for the souls of her deceased patrons. This was decidedly not done to seek fame or reward. When this matter reached official ears, she was granted two silver pieces in recognition and commendation. Thus Mayuzumi's name resounded throughout the Eastern Capital.

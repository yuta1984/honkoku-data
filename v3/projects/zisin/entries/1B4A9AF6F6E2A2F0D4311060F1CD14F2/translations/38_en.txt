fire. On the same day, the island headman dispatched a letter, which arrived at the government office on the 18th day, so I dare to report the above. An'ei 6th year (1777), Hinoto-Tori, 8th month, 19th day, Izu Province General Magistrate Egawa [name], with utmost fear and reverence, submits this to the Main Office of the General Accounting Bureau. Retainer [name] respectfully responds.

In response to your inquiry: Mount Mihara is located in the exact center of Ōshima, at an elevation of twelve ri, where five villages reside at the base of the mountain. During the divine fire of the Tenna period, the summit of Mount Mihara became a crater. The current divine fire also emerges from that same old crater, which is called "Go-hora" (Sacred Crater). The flying ash and iron liquid-like substances fell on two or three villages, while spider silk-like material accumulated around our village like spider webs, not like accumulated snow. Currently, no island officials have come, so we rely only on verbal reports from ship captains, and therefore cannot observe the details closely. 8th month, [certain day], retainer Egawa [name].

Hinoto-Tori, 9th month, 19th day, retainer Egawa [name] reports: One island magistrate from Ōshima left the island on the 12th of this month, landed yesterday, and entered the capital. When retainer [name] inquired about the condition of the island fire, the island magistrate responded as follows:

1. Mount Mihara, in Tenna 4th year (1684), Kinoe-Ne, erupted from the summit, collapsing and splitting to form a crater one and a half ri square plus sixty steps, of unknown depth. It did not extinguish for seven years, finally dying out in Genroku 3rd year, Kanoe-Uma (1690). This year on the 29th day of the 7th month at evening, fire emerged from that crater. At night the flames filled the sky, during the day only smoke could be seen, sometimes thick, sometimes thin. The burning sounds were severe, earthquakes frequent, and spider silk-like ash and iron liquid-like ash fell. Until the 27th and 28th days of the 8th month, the burning sounds and earthquakes all ceased, and ash stopped falling. On the 29th day, due to north wind and rain, the crater fire became fierce again. By the 6th day of the 9th month at dawn it was particularly severe, the flames grew increasingly violent, explosive sounds like thunder, and the ground shook continuously. On the 8th and 9th days there were great windstorms and rain; when the wind and rain stopped at evening, the fire sounds became even more intense. This continued until the 12th day in the same manner, but ash did not fly; instead stones and sand fell carried by the wind. At this time the fire

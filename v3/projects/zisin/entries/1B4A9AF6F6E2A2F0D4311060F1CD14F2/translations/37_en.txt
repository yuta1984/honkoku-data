This year, on the 29th day of the 7th month, in the afternoon, fire suddenly erupted from within the crater. Red smoke billowed up piercing the sky, explosive sounds like thunder occurred, and the ground shook repeatedly. At that time, hair-like ash particles flew about, one to two or three sun in length, black and white in color, mixed with iron liquid-like ash. On the 6th of this month, heavy rain fell throughout the night, and the flames and explosive sounds became somewhat more intense. On the 7th day it was particularly severe; the ground continued to shake, ash fell repeatedly, and this did not stop until the 11th day. Men and women were terrified and abandoned their occupations. Among the island's elders, some remember the island fire during the Tenna period, so following that precedent, islanders regardless of gender, those without defilement, entered the sea for purification rituals, and prayed for salvation of life at shrines in various villages.

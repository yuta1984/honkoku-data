Good Fortune
Planting orchids, keeping away from the worry of gold, and nurturing nearby with the duty of life.

September 19th
The person I was waiting for does not appear, so the sky is cloudy, and my heart remains unclear like the moon in a dark night.

Your safe establishment of business is proceeding well.
Recently, I have not made inquiries and have been distant from you.
I congratulate you on your diligent work in your business endeavors. Generally speaking, I have been waiting for the time when you would come to Saga, but since I have not heard about your situation recently, I am quite concerned and would like to make a brief inquiry, which is why I am writing this letter. Even if I ask whether there are any issues with your handling of affairs or matters of the heart, you might think such inquiries are pointless. However, if I could hear about your circumstances from time to time, it would put my mind at ease. Although there will surely be various matters to handle, I would like to know about your situation up to this point.
This is just an inquiry. Please excuse the hasty writing.

Recently, I have not made inquiries and have been quite distant.
I am most pleased to hear that you are generally in good spirits and working diligently. This year, even in Saga, there have been nothing but earthquakes and various other disasters, making things very difficult. However, I understand there have been no earthquakes in your area, which is reassuring.
Lately, prices of all goods have become extremely high, causing much trouble. Now, I understand there is a request from Lady Oyoshi, and I have been instructed to send you a letter, so I am forwarding it to you.
First, let me send my regards. With best wishes.

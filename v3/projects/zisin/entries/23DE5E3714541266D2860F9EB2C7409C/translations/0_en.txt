Kept Woman (Mistress):
My patron has been crushed to death, and now I have no one to support me. Please look favorably upon the carpenter from the alley and make him my patron.

Plasterer:
Thanks to you, I have plenty of work on storehouse walls and such. Since nothing like this has happened before, I will make a pilgrimage to your main shrine next year. Please give my regards to the catfish as well. I would also like to request work on another storehouse - please grant this as well.

Child:
Since my mother died, my father has been so kind to me. Please grant that he gives me four or eight mon coins.

Rich Person:
I am truly troubled by this great commotion. But from now on, please ensure that nothing bad happens.

Roofer:
Thanks to you, we can make money. Please become an even greater millionaire so we may prosper further.

Tile Maker (to the right of the catfish's face):
Please ensure that everyone, including the authorities, switches to tile roofing.

Carpenter:
I have plenty of work, but lumber is truly expensive, which troubles me. Please grant me your divine favor and bestow upon me big construction projects.

Construction Worker (Tobi):
I've been busier than usual since spring, but this time is especially profitable, so I have plenty of money. I pray to you as well.

Cheap Prostitute:
Thanks to you, my life was saved. Please help me find good male customers with plenty of money.

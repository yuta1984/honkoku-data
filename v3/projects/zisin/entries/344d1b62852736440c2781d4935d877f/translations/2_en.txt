Tales of Earthquakes

From around 10 PM on June 14th, a great earthquake occurred, and since the tremors have not stopped even now, everyone is startled and frightened. The areas around Kyoto, Osaka, and Sakai are in similar condition, but in the vicinity of Nara, Koriyama, Kizu, and Kasagi, there has been severe collapse with reports of fatalities. There are rumors that Iga, Ise, and Omi provinces also shook greatly. Regarding this, various street rumors are spreading in confusion, and people are bewildered. Therefore, I recalled a lecture I heard from a Buddhist priest at Enmanji temple in previous years, and when I opened the sutras and treatises, I found the following:

According to the calendar based on the twenty-eight lunar mansions in the Manjushri Bodhisattva Sukuyō Sutra, June 14th corresponds to the Dipper constellation (Tō-shuku), the 15th to the Girl constellation (Jo-shuku), and the 16th to the Void constellation (Kyo-shuku).

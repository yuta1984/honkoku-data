The Bodhisattva Nagarjuna's "Mahaprajnaparamita Shastra," volume eight, states: "There are four types of earthquakes: fire movement, dragon movement, garuda (golden-winged bird) movement, and heavenly king movement. When the sun and moon revolve around the twenty-eight lunar mansions, if earthquakes or collapses occur when the moon is in the six mansions of Pleiades, Bow, Root, Bond, Encampment, or Stomach, these earthquakes belong to the fire deity. At such times there is no rain, rivers and streams dry up, the year is unsuitable for wheat, the emperor faces misfortune, and ministers suffer calamity. If earthquakes or collapses occur during the six mansions of Willow, Tail, Winnowing Basket, Eastern Wall, Legs, or Rooftop, these earthquakes belong to the dragon deity. At such times there is also no rain, rivers and streams dry up, the year is unsuitable for wheat, the emperor faces misfortune, and ministers suffer calamity. If earthquakes or collapses occur during the six mansions of Three Stars, Ghost, Star, Chariot Platform, Neck, or Wings, these earthquakes belong to the garuda. At such times there is also no rain, rivers and streams dry up, the year is unsuitable for wheat, the emperor faces misfortune, and ministers suffer calamity. If earthquakes or collapses occur during the nine mansions of Heart, Horn, Room, Girl, Void, Well, Net, Turtle Beak, or Dipper, these earthquakes belong to the Heavenly Emperor. At such times there is peace and tranquility, wind and rain are favorable, conditions are suitable for the five grains, the emperor enjoys good fortune, ministers receive blessings, and all people are at peace."

Thus the treatise of this great sage is clear. Therefore, since the current earthquakes and collapses occurred during the three mansions of Dipper, Girl, and Void, this earthquake will actually improve the world, bringing even greater peace under heaven and tranquility to all people—this we should believe deeply and gratefully, setting our minds at ease.

Someone objected, saying: "According to today's calendar, June 14th corresponds to the Willow mansion, the 15th to the Star mansion, and the 16th to the Bow mansion. How do we account for this difference from the sutra's explanation?" I replied: "Long ago, Master Kobo went to Tang China and [studied under] Keika, a disciple of the Tripitaka Master Amoghavajra..."

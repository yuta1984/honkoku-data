The master received direct transmission from this dharma teacher and brought back what is now the Koyasan edition of the "Sukuyokyo" (Constellation Sutra), which states: "The Ox constellation is considered the auspicious constellation, presiding over the noon hour each day. Therefore, the Indian calendar considers the noon hour auspicious." The allocation of the remaining twenty-seven constellations to 360 days is the teaching of Manjushri Bodhisattva. Also in the "Mahaprajnaparamita Shastra," the Ox constellation is treated separately, with explanations given for twenty-seven constellations. This is said to be exactly as taught by the Buddha. However, in today's calendars, the Ox constellation is also included, using all twenty-eight constellations for daily allocation, which is said to be a later interpretation by subsequent scholars.

Another question: "This earthquake began shaking around the tenth day in the Yamato region, and Naniwa (Osaka) still occasionally trembles, so it would be difficult to definitively determine the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth days, wouldn't it?" I replied: "I have heard that major earthquakes reverberate for several days before and after, sometimes extending for several months. Regarding this earthquake's destructive effects, it is said that everywhere experienced them simultaneously at the hour of the boar on the fourteenth day, and the tremors before and after were all aftershocks of this main event. Since the treatise mentions 'earthquakes or collapses,' it would be appropriate to say this occurred during the three constellations of Dipper, Girl, and Void. Furthermore, the treatise states that 'no rain and dried rivers are inauspicious,' but since rain fell from the night of the seventeenth, this should be considered increasingly auspicious. However, since I am ignorant and unlearned, I cannot make definitive judgments. I would like to inquire about this with my teacher, but he resides at a distant temple. Writing this hastily without awaiting verification will surely invite ridicule from learned scholars, but I am merely recording this account of the earthquake (jishin, which also means 'oneself')."

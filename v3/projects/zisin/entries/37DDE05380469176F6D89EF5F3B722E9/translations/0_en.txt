Shin-Yoshiwara: The Fearsome Barrier Gate

In such a dark night, wives, children, and even customers flee toward the great gate, worrying about their fate. Wiping themselves as they emerge, they cannot bear to stay on the second floor stairs and leap down in one bound, wearing horse-claw hairpins precariously as they flee near the great gate. The deity of Kashima holds down the catfish. "When it shakes, we cannot bear this great earthquake. What a terrible thing! We still cannot remain calm. Isn't this an earthquake?" "Yes, it is. We should profit from this earthquake as our dish," they talk below while the courtesans stand resting outside the gate. "Please let us through this great gate." "Look, there's trouble at the great gate!" "What? What do you mean by trouble?" "Ah, you are courtesans. In this great earthquake, without bringing young attendants or child apprentices, what did you come alone to this great gate for?" "Ah, I am one who must evacuate to temporary housing. Please let me through the gate." "I see, I would let you through, but do you have protective amulets?" "That's not the issue now." "Without amulets, it's dangerous." "In this great earthquake, you must be in great difficulty. Shall I put you in a palanquin and help you escape?" "I see, if it's the main street I'd let you through, but if I'm going to shake things up, will you fall down each time?" "Yes, I'll probably fall even on the road." "First of all, don't be startled. Now, throughout Edo there's this great earthquake commotion and fires burning everything. Even in this situation, the sight of people fleeing covered in ash like demons from the burnt ruins is pitiful, so they were pushed out of the pleasure quarter and made to flee this way and that."

Regarding the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of the great earthquake at the hour of the Monkey on the 29th day of the 12th month of last year. On the 29th day of the 12th month of last year, day of hinoe-tatsu (丙辰), at the hour of the Monkey, Kui constellation was positioned at hinoe (丙) and became active, the general was Suzaku (Vermillion Bird) with great auspiciousness in the middle, the general was Daiin at the end, Taiitsu was selected, and it was Tenkū, encountering Jūkaku.

Upon consideration, this was brought about by cosmic principles (riun), and above it is not a matter of being cautious about imperial medicine, but rather announcing matters of slander and military upheaval from the northeast direction. The critical period is within 35 days after the earthquake day, as well as during the seasonal periods of the coming 3rd, 4th, and 8th months, and on mizunoe and mizunoto days. Why do we say this? Because the active force arises from the punishment deity, which governs cosmic principles. Also, making the position above Taisui into Tenun-haku immediately governs matters of imperial medicine. Also, on the 20th day of the active period, we see the commanding deity bearing the Suzaku hexagram passing through Jūkaku. This is why it governs slander and military upheaval. Additionally, receiving prayers during the main critical period, if one is especially cautious, will the imperial fault disappear by itself?

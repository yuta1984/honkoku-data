Bunei 5th year
○Yoshitsugiki: Bunei 5th year, 5th month, 4th day, palace visit. At the hour of the Dragon, there was a great earthquake. Acting Astronomer-Doctor Taishō was summoned privately and came to serve. The Head Middle Captain served as administrator. They went together to the appropriate place where inquiries were made about the earthquake divination. When the Head Middle Captain respectfully inquired as ordered, the divination was inauspicious. It indicated that especially the court nobles should exercise caution, as various calamitous events would compete to arise. When asked what prayers and rituals should be conducted privately, it was reported that the Tenchū-Chifu ritual would be appropriate. There was an imperial command that I should arrange this matter. Immediately conferring with Court Noble Taishō, it was ordered that an auspicious date should be selected. It was reported that the day after tomorrow, the 6th, would be suitable. It was ordered that preparations should be advanced. [Omitted in the middle]

Regarding precautions for the great earthquake, field observations, and divination texts, it was ordered and determined to Monk Jōsai that particular sincerity should be devoted to this.

Humbly noting: At this time, due to other matters, there were esoteric Buddhist rituals at the imperial palace, which Monk Jōsai performed.

6th day, palace visit. Today is the Tenchū-Chifu ritual. Imperial messenger and chamberlain Kunihiro brought the imperial purification objects. This is a one-day ritual. [Abbreviated below]

When he said this, there was a Goma Hall (fire ritual hall) there, and they told him "Go to this place." So he entered this hall and was greatly pleased, saying "Well, well, I can reside here in peace. The tone has been corrected for the first time." He expressed his wish to stay there indefinitely, but soon an earthquake began shaking with tremendous intensity beyond description. {{Marginal note: The great earthquake of the Tiger Year as commonly known}} What became of him? That Goma Hall was built in kakeづukuri style (suspended construction), and soon collapsed into the deep valley and was destroyed, and Shihōichi also perished. He would have been over sixty years old. Having ended this life, it is strange that one who could keenly discern people's fortunes and misfortunes not only did not know the place of his own end, but found peace at the moment of death. Where good reaches its extreme becomes bad, and where bad

reaches its extreme becomes good—this must be the reason. As always, this is a meaningless tale, he said. In my humble opinion, Shihōichi's remarkable abilities were beyond praise. That he already sensed the heaven and earth's calamity and fled to Mount Atago was indeed reasonable. When he reached this mountain and his tone was corrected, there may have been that change as well, but this would be the same principle as when yin reaches its extreme it transforms into yang, when yang reaches its extreme it generates yin, and when joy reaches its extreme it gives birth to sorrow. At that time, because it was a great calamity affecting all of Kyoto, the earthquake energy filled everything so that there was no road to walk on and no place to flee to. Since Shihōichi's body had also reached its extreme point, it seems perfectly reasonable that his tone was corrected instead.

The Ise Shrine fire incident, with imperial concerns mounting, urgent dispatch was made to report this matter《marginal note: abbreviated》

Imperial Edict
Upon hearing of the Great Shrine fire disaster on the 21st day of the 12th month of last year, [His Majesty] was shocked and his fear and trepidation were truly deep.
Separately reporting, the Bureau of Astronomy's reports of anomalies have been frequent, and
moreover, on the 29th day of the 12th month of last year, the earth shook greatly, causing alarm
that was particularly severe. When divination was performed regarding this, it was reported that shrines in the southeast-southwest directions were causing divine retribution.
The southeast direction corresponds to the Great Ise Shrine.
It is natural to be alarmed wondering what transgression or divine curse this might be. O Heaven that bestowed the deep vows without error, though I may be unworthy, I will surely receive divine assistance.

With fear and trepidation, this is humbly reported
　Nin'an 4, 1st month, 26th day

Taking their wives and children, they left two or three watchmen in each village, transported rice, miso, and household goods, assembled rafts and prepared boats to await unexpected events. Also, since the ford at Koichi village had no water and the villages feared flood damage from the torrents during flood times, the lord of Kaizu gathered several thousand people and built triple-layered embankments with stone-filled straw bags extending to the end of Yotsuya village, making flood prevention extremely strict. Furthermore, he ordered fire-signal specialists to prepare beacon fires to be raised from the mountaintops where water had accumulated, taught this to mountain villages, and established uniform procedures whereby, using signals to immediately notify valley villages, the remaining watchmen of each village and even traveling merchants would rush up the western mountains. The lord of Kaizu had dozens of rescue boats constructed and moored them at nearby villages, and also set up large cauldrons

They maintained thorough preparations and waited for overflow, but after more than ten days with no incidents, they announced to all villages that there would certainly be no sudden collapse and outflow, and that the water would gradually flow out in an orderly manner. Based on this, the villages returned and many people resumed farming. However, on April 13th, as the evening sun tilted westward, suddenly like a great mountain collapsing, massive floodwaters of several tens of jō overflowed at Koichi-guchi. The sound of the water vibrated and thundered through the neighborhood, first sweeping away and drowning Koichi village, then reaching the villages of Komatsubara, Nakajima, and Yotsuya, where all large and small trees were swept away. Half of Hikōga village was washed away, and the true image of the monk Genkai in eternal meditation at Yuinenji temple on Ichijūyama in the same village appeared in the Buddha hall due to the floodwaters. Tanba Island was fortunate, with only about twenty houses swept away.

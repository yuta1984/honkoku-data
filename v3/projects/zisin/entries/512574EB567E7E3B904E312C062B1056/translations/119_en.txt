Although we exhausted all available manpower within the domain and had many people dispatched from neighboring villages that might also suffer flood damage to carry out construction work with utmost effort, against this enormous flood force it provided not even one ten-thousandth of adequate defense and was swept away in a short time. Regarding the collapse of Mount Majin north of Koichi Village ferry crossing, one of the three locations where the Sai River channel was blocked by debris (as previously reported): an area approximately twenty ken high, eighty ken north-south, and fifty ken east-west was pushed into the river channel, leaving only about seven ken of remaining river width.

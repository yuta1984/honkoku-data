Bunsei 13th year
7th month, 21st day, Year of the Tiger　Written by the Master of Shiseido

This single volume "Earthquake Considerations" contains the investigations of my teacher, Master Tozan. Recently, children, women, and the sick have been bewildered by various false theories and trembled with fear. Moreover, since even small tremors have not ceased, people worry that a great earthquake may come and their hearts are not at peace. Therefore, I cite examples from successive generations to dispel such delusions and bring peace to their minds.

The capital (Kyoto) has rarely experienced great earthquakes since ancient times. Eighty years have passed from the great earthquake of Hōreki 1st year (1751) to this year, so few people remember it. Many people lose their lives and sustain injuries in connection with such disasters. Though they are calamities of the times, one cannot say they are unavoidable either. In countries where earthquakes are frequent, warehouse and house construction takes this into consideration, and people are mentally prepared in their daily lives, so even with great earthquakes, deaths by crushing are few. The ground splitting, mountain collapses, land subsidence, island emergence, and tsunami occurrences recorded in successive generations of Japanese and Chinese histories all occurred in border regions. Through shallow knowledge and hasty arguments, various explanations make it sound as if the entire earth moves, but this is not so. As stated at the beginning, earthquakes are localized movements in various places.

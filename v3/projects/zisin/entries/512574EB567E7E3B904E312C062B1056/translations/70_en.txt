However, the theory that a great catfish dwells beneath the earth is also a folk belief that has been passed down since ancient times. Also, on the cover of a calendar from the 9th year of Kenkyū (1198), there is something called "the earthquake insect" with its form drawn and the names of Japan's sixty-six provinces recorded. Though it may be folk belief, since such things existed already six or seven hundred years ago, the catfish theory might have its basis in some written work. In Buddhist teachings, it is also said to be the work of dragons. Ancient theories were generally of this nature.

○Regarding earthquakes and their portentous signs, the astronomical treatises in the Han Shu and Jin Shu record various responses, but from the Tang Shu's astronomical treatise onward, they record the phenomena but not the responses. This is based on the principle of the Spring and Autumn Annals. In our current peaceful reign, what responses could there be? Earthquakes are disasters and anomalies in themselves, and there should be no external responses. People should put their minds at ease and not neglect their respective duties.

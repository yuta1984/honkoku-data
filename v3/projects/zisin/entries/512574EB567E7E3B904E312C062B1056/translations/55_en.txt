　Emperor Saga, Kōnin 9th year, 7th month: There were earthquakes in Sagami, Musashi, Shimōsa, Hitachi, Kōzuke, Shimotsuke and other provinces. Mountains collapsed and valleys were buried for several ri, and the number of common people crushed to death was incalculable.
　8th month, day of Kōgo: Envoys were dispatched to various provinces to inspect earthquake damage, and relief aid was provided to those whose losses were severe. The imperial edict stated: "Though I am of shallow learning and meager virtue, I reverently accept the precious throne and govern without forgetting my sincere desire to nurture the people. However, military rule still stagnates, and imperial virtue has not yet spread widely. The arrival of this calamitous punishment is particularly severe because of this."

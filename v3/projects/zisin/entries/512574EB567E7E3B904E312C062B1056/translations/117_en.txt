Yesterday on the 13th, past seven o'clock in the evening, the aforementioned mountain area began rumbling loudly, followed by the high sound of rushing water. While we were wondering about this suspicious occurrence, torrential water suddenly burst into the Sai River. In an instant, the embankment at Koichi Village to the north was broken through, and to the south the water overflowed the earthen embankment at Komatsubara. Our flood prevention measures could not cope, and as river officials sent successive urgent reports, the water soon burst across the entire Kawanakajima area and flowed into the Chikuma River. Additionally, water from the downstream Ochiai area and elsewhere rose high up to the vicinity of the residential castle. From evening until before midnight, the Chikuma River rose about two jō above normal water level, and not only Kawanakajima but the entire eastern and northern river areas were submerged underwater. Several locations appeared to have formed new stream channels, and there must be extensive areas covered with rice bales and mud, as well as numerous places that were scoured out.

However, it is difficult to assess the full extent. After midnight passed, the water level finally seemed to stabilize, and by dawn it gradually appeared to be receding. Although I had previously ordered village residents to prepare flood prevention measures, this was a sudden disaster following recent events, so I fear that many people quickly fell victim to the flood, with numerous houses swept away and many drownings. I immediately dispatched inspectors to assess the damage to the reservoir, but since it is quite distant from the castle town, they have not yet returned. I will investigate the details once the water recedes and report them, but I hereby submit this preliminary report.

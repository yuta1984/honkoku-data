The "Suwen Wuyun Xing Dalun" (Basic Questions: Great Treatise on the Five Movements) states: "When wind prevails, then the earth moves." The "Kaii Bendan" (Strange Phenomena Analysis) states: "Following this theory, earthquakes are caused by wind energy. It also says that the folk explanation of earthquakes involving catfish may be using catfish to represent wind. Since fish are yang creatures within yin, they might be used as a metaphor for wind. In any case, this is an explanation far from the true principle." Arai Hakuseki's "Tōga" says: "Calling earthquakes 'naifuru' - 'nai' means sound/rumbling, and 'fururu' means to move. It signifies rumbling movement. Today people also say 'naiyuru.' 'Yuru' also means to move. 'Yurufu' and 'yurukasu' are also the same. In ancient language, expressions like 'yu-

okashi' are exactly this." In my opinion, they also say "naefuru" in the northern frontier regions. What is the basis for "nae" appearing in the "Sancai Tuhui" (Illustrated Compendium of the Three Powers)? If one says "nae," when "nae" is shortened it becomes "ne." "Ne" means root and refers to earth. This makes perfect sense for earthquakes. The "Yangzi Fangyan" (Yangzi's Regional Dialects) states: "In Eastern Qi, they call roots 'earth' - not referring exclusively to mulberry roots." Also, does "Ne no kuni" (Root Country) appearing in the "Nihon Shoki Jindai no maki" (Chronicles of Japan, Age of the Gods) refer to earth? Also, someone says "'Naiyuru' is 'namiyuru' - referring to swaying like waves on water."

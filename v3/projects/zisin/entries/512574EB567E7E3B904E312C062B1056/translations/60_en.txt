25th day, Tsuchinoto-U: Earthquake

13th day of the 10th month, Hinoto-Tori: An imperial edict was issued stating: "As we have heard, the earthquake in the territory of Mutsu Province was particularly severe. In some places, seawater violently overflowed causing disasters, and in others, castle buildings collapsed and brought calamity. What fault do the people bear? Only this calamity exists, and I am filled with sorrow and shame—the deep responsibility lies with me. Now I dispatch envoys to bestow imperial benevolence, and together with the provincial governors, regardless of whether they are ordinary people or barbarians, diligently provide personal care and comfort.

In ancient times, when crops withered in Zhou's suburbs, they felt guilt and stopped the disaster by ending [the cause].

It is proper to implement virtuous governance to rescue those who are withering and declining. Order Dazaifu that for those whose disaster damage is particularly severe, provide them with 4,000 koku of stored rice and grain from previous years, strive to add care for their survival, and do not let them lose their livelihoods. Also, for corpses and scattered remains under collapsed walls and destroyed houses, have officials collect and bury them, and do not let them be exposed."

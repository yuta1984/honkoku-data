At my domain of Matsushiro, as I reported earlier today on the 14th, the circumstances of water pressing up to the vicinity of the residential castle were as follows: water burst over the earthen embankment downstream from Komatsubara Village at the outlet of the Sai River, and from there water surged across the entire Kawanakajima area. The Chikuma River water, starting from around Yokota Village about one ri upstream from the castle town and continuing downstream, burst through everywhere with extremely strong water force. Water also gradually accumulated from the lower reaches, creating overflowing floodwater that progressively swept everything away, with the water level rising higher than the land within the castle grounds. The flood prevention earthen embankment that was constructed during the Bunsei era (as previously reported and approved) served as protection, but although it suffered major damage, it was too densely built to remove quickly. During this time the water receded, allowing us to weather the danger. The water rose from both upstream and downstream enough to reach the castle town area, and the flood extended to the eastern and northern river areas as well as the Naka-

-no-daira area, appearing like tidal water, but as it gradually receded, I immediately dispatched inspectors. However, most of the large and small bridges were likely swept away, and even after the water receded, the roads that had been scoured out during the earthquakes made passage difficult. Regarding the damage: the water level gradually increased to a depth of twenty jō, and as it slowly rose, the foothills of Mount Iwakura progressively collapsed and eroded, creating new water channels. When the floodwater began rising, it caused rocks and boulders to suddenly collapse, resulting in extensive erosion into the foothills of Mount Iwakura as well. The massive floodwater that had accumulated for several days burst out toward Kawanakajima and Nakajima. The earthen embankments and stone-filled straw bales on both banks at Koichi Village ferry crossing, which had been hastily constructed to prevent this, were related to emergency flood prevention measures for the government and private domain villages of Kawanakajima, eastern rivers, and northern rivers.

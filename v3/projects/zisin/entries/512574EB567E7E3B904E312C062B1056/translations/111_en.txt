Among village areas and individuals where the disaster damage was relatively light, there are those who, recognizing their good fortune, have made献上物 (献上物: offerings) for relief efforts, or have dedicated themselves to providing financial assistance and continuous charitable acts - this is extremely commendable. They will be rewarded in due course. Furthermore, if everyone makes efforts and works diligently from now on, it will be most beneficial. Village officials should receive and report the names and circumstances of such commendable individuals. Moreover, since there are many villages, if there are any who are overlooked by relief efforts, it would go against the lord's intentions, so village officials should understand this well, handle matters with even greater care and compassion, and ensure that notifications reach even the smallest farmers without omission.

Since last month's great earthquake, due to extraordinary disasters such as flooding, everyone is in distress, and with many construction projects such as temporary shelters and other building work, carpenters and craftsmen should make every effort and work diligently. Under no circumstances should they misunderstand and receive extra payment beyond the established rates for construction work and daily wages - this is unacceptable. They must strictly observe this principle and work with sincerity without misunderstanding. Village officials in villages where various craftsmen reside should communicate this message, and each person should understand this matter.

The horse assistant Kuniyuki reported to the court (Hachijō-in and others) that due to illness, he was unable to attend.
The Retired Emperor descended to the garden and sat beneath a tree. The Empress also 
had her carriage positioned in the garden. The damage to the imperial residence was particularly severe, with the main sleeping hall tilted and

even in foreign countries or other domains, if such events occurred, this would be the extremity of the final age, an evil of heaven and earth,

　　Great mourning　　　Misfortune for the Emperor
　　Movement in the 7th month　　Military rebellion within 100 days  
　　Movement in the first ten days　　Harm to the great ministers
　　Or also, the Empress should be cautious　Drought, etc.
Furthermore, regarding future omens, the following applies. Seeing the current devastation of the realm,
there is nothing that can be done. His Majesty moved to an island in the pond. Afterwards,
a curtained enclosure was erected in the southern garden to serve as his residence. The western corridor of the Imperial Palace

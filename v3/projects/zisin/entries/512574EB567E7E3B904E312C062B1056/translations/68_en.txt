In the Kesei En'gi, Kong Mo states: "When yang energy lies dormant beneath yin and feels pressed by yin, unable to rise, it leads to earth movement." Thus, when steam lies hidden underground and tries to emerge, it is suppressed by yin energy and cannot escape, causing violent clashing and oscillation within the earth. Similarly, Bo Tang-fu's words in the Zhou Yu section of the Guo Yu, and others from ancient times, all expound this theory.

According to the Tenkei Wakumon: "The earth is originally formed when the dregs of qi condense to create physical substance, bound within the rotation of primordial qi, thus standing firmly suspended in the void without falling. It has holes all around that connect with each other, like a bee's nest or like fungal valves, with water and fire qi lurking within. Presumably, when qi surges and wishes to expand but cannot extend, like a person's

sinews contracting and pulse fluctuating, it shares the same principle as thunder. The land beneath the North Pole experiences great cold, while that beneath the equator is intensely hot, and both have few earthquakes. Sandy soil has sparse qi that does not gather, so earthquakes are few. Clay soil has no place to store qi, so earthquakes are few. In warm, rocky areas, there are cavities underground where hot qi blows in and is compressed by cold qi; when this reaches its limit, it expands and strikes the earth violently. For example, if one fires cannons or explosives beneath tall buildings and towers, they cannot avoid receiving the shock. However, earthquakes do not occur throughout the entire earth. Earthquakes are localized to each place, each with its own qi and movement—only in one specific location. Depending on their intensity, there are various [types]..."

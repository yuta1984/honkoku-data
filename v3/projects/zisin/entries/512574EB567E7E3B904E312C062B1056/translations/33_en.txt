Regarding the earthquake matter:
　　The court records official's report is as follows: This great earthquake has few precedents, and in all respects is astonishing,
　　troubling His Imperial Majesty's heart. Concerning all matters, how should they be handled? The details should be
　　reported in full.

Regarding the Imperial Palace matter:
　　The western corridor of the current palace has already collapsed, and the four walls have almost no substance remaining. The
　　Great Imperial Palace must be relocated. Moreover, the Nikka Gate and the Archery Hall have similarly collapsed.
　　Concerning these matters, how should we proceed? This is truly a difficult situation to handle. Similarly, after consultation,
　　this should be reported.
　　　Regarding these two matters, confidentially,
　　　such is the intention of the Retired Emperor. Therefore, I respectfully report this. Mitsumasa humbly and respectfully
　　　submits this.

　　　The petition document states as follows:
　　　Regarding the earthquake matter:
　　　The matter of imperial prayers is detailed in the court records official's report. From among these, the essential points should be extracted, and through
　　　discussion appropriate to the times, there should be an imperial decision. Also, should implementation be permitted according to
　　　the results of imperial divination?
　　　Furthermore, after the military campaigns, the country is impoverished, and during the earthquakes, buildings have collapsed.

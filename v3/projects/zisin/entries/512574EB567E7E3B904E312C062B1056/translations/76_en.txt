According to a story from the ninth year of Kyōhō in the "Enju-ki" (a collection of essays from the mid-Edo period), there was once a blind man named Shihōichi. He was a renowned master of listening to musical tones and never made mistakes when divining people's good and bad fortune. He would casually visit Ōzan (the imperial family's temple) frequently and wait in attendance in the antechamber. In his later years, he said: "I sense something inexplicable and it troubles me greatly. Every day when I interact with people, I hear all their fortunes and misfortunes echoing in my ears, and it is very disturbing." His achievements were so numerous they were countless to enumerate. This Shihōichi rose early one morning, called his servant, and said: "Oh my, this is a terrible tone. With this tone, the entire capital of Kyoto will likely be destroyed. Quickly prepare some food and first guide me toward Saga..."

"...district." Given his usual decisiveness, they immediately headed west toward Saga, reached the foothills of Arashiyama at Ōi River, rested briefly, and he said: "The tone still hasn't improved. This is dangerous. There will likely be a great fire." They left the areas with houses and crossed north, but the tone was still the same, so he said: "This place also seems bad. There's a place I know at Atago. Guide me there." So they climbed again, and thus arrived at that temple. A monk came out and said: "You've climbed the mountain quite early," to which he replied: "Such and such circumstances have arisen." When asked "How is this place?", he responded: "This place is still not clear either. I would like to go to an even higher place."

I have created a diagram based on the "Tianjing Huowen" (Celestial Classic Questions and Answers) to clarify this.

[Left Page]
The earth's circumference is 90,000 ri. Taking the Chinese ri as 6 chō and converting to the Japanese ri of 36 chō, the circumference becomes 15,000 ri. At this rate, the distance from the earth's center to the surface is approximately 2,500 ri. In this diagram, the space between the black dots is approximately 1,500 ri. When we consider this earthquake's scope as 200 ri, it corresponds to merely within the small circle shown in the diagram. From this, one should consider how minute the area of vibration is and how vast the earth is.

○ [Large red circle] In my humble opinion, in all creation between heaven and earth, there is a beginning and end. The beginning is the foundation, which is the core (shin). The core refers to the extremely violent [place] where vibrations occur.

it is appropriate to seek the protection of various phenomena, solely looking up to moral transformation, for the Way of Heaven brings fortune to good and calamity to evil.

【Red inscription】"Opinion"
The most essential point among the opinions sought regarding the purport of moral transformation is to open one's heart and demonstrate submission. Therefore, scholars of various disciplines among the court nobles and below who are capable should be made to discuss the reasons for these events, and an imperial decree should be issued. The memorial should be kept deeply secret, never to be heard outside, fully stating what is necessary, and particularly regarding matters where flattery should not be employed, should this not be especially commanded? Based on the purport of that memorial, the essentials of governance should be deliberated and decided. If this discussion is mistaken, will heavenly anomalies and earthly portents continue without cease, and rebellions and disturbances be expected to follow one after another? However, if the articles of virtuous government cannot be discussed, would opinions also lack benefit? This humble minister only thinks of the nation's turmoil and ruin, having already forgotten the invitation to merit achievement, and fears. I respectfully and carefully submit this to your attention.

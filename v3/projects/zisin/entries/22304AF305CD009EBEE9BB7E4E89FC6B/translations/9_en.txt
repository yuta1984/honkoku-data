Perhaps they forgot their illnesses. Here is a mad poem by an old man.

About the events of the second day of the seventh month, Kanoe-Tora year:
From the hour of申上刻, the earthquake was fierce
At first people gathered together chanting "world renewal" | In panic from Kuwabara to Senkō temple
Town houses and storehouses, walls immediately fell | Temple and shrine fence walls collapsed along with pillars
Old women chanted Buddhist prayers in shrill voices | Grandfathers prayed to gods with pale faces
Farmers left their hoes and all entered the thickets | Boatmen abandoned their boats and climbed alone onto the embankments
Heaven and earth shook with no remedy | Chaos above and below spread to all ten directions

Well, even on the tenth day there were slight rumblings and occasional tremors. On the eleventh day, after sunset, rain began to fall in drops, and at the seventh hour of night there was rumbling and quite strong shaking. On the twelfth day, altogether there were four or five times daily of rumbling without fail at regular times. By the thirteenth day, with the storehouses remaining damaged and taking on rain, soil constantly sliding down - the sound was truly dreadful, especially at night when the world was quiet, the shock was incomprehensible, and people whispering among themselves was quite amusing.

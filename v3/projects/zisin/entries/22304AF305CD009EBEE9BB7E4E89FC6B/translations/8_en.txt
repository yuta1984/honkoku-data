Record of the Great Earthquake, Part Two

While it is said that if one understands the principles of heaven and earth clearly, one will not be intimidated by things, and if one's spirit is strong, one will not be startled by events, there is a proverb that goes "born as a black dog, lye drippings and dregs." The great disaster of the second day truly penetrated to the very core, and even the slightest rumbling caused people to cover their heads in fear. Since then, while there have been many sick people, there are also those in the neighborhood whose illnesses were cured by the earthquake. This is surely due to the strengthening of one's vital energy.

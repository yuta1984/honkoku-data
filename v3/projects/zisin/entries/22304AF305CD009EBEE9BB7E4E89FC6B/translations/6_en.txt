While people were discussing among themselves, the earth continued to rumble and shake without pause, and there were very many instances of people using staffs to prop up and support old houses and old storehouses that were on the verge of collapse. People making sudden moves were creating commotion here and there, and by the fourth day, at night everyone was showing some physical fatigue, and while just dozing, the fifth day arrived. Not knowing where to place hand or foot (being at a complete loss), through the sixth, seventh, and eighth days, the nights remained cloudy with no rain falling at all. At night, during the eighth and seventh hours (around 2 AM and 4 AM), fairly strong rumbling shaking would come, and everyone would emerge onto the main streets again to discuss whether this might be the seventh day, the major quake of that night. While chanting incantations and sitting, the ninth day arrived and still the rumbling continued intermittently without stopping. This was truly an unprecedented disaster, and there was nothing to do but pray to the gods, have faith in Buddha, and conduct oneself with restraint. As a poem of understanding:

Thunder strikes us on the head, and with earthquakes
Our bottoms are pinched—Heaven's scolding

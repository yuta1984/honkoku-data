【First Tier】
Kashima: "What a disaster, what a disaster! This great earthquake has burned houses and storehouses, stones have overturned, and we have large and small skewers of grilled catfish skin. However, given the reasoning of these times, money-selling might be essential - gourd, gourd, reputation, reputation, as they say."

Fire: "Hey there, aren't you Thunder and the old man heading somewhere?"

Old man: "If that's Fire speaking, where are you going?"

Fire: "I plan to extinguish myself before Kashima-sama uses me to grill the catfish."

Old man: "That's good. Fire, earthquakes are utterly boorish."

Fire: "So, what kind of world are you folks in?"

Thunder: "Since evacuation is trending, I'm secretly opening a new business with my retirement."

Fire: "That sounds fun, but Thunder won't make any profit."

Thunder: "Why, why not?"

Fire: "Because you're just a local troublemaker."

Geisha: "Hey, shamisen shop owner, are you busy these days?"

Shamisen shop owner: "Not at all! Since the earthquake, I can't even get payment for one string, let alone three. I'm truly troubled by this four-hemorrhoid situation. I really don't know what to do. I hear you've been warming up with oden and heated sake."

Geisha: "That was just temporarily, for the moment. If it goes on too long, I'll get into trouble."

Boatman: "Indeed, our business is much the same - we can barely afford a topknot trimming for just two shu and three cho."

Kimono merchant: "Every back alley is the same. There's no profitable talk about money, just idle complaints and blue-faced grumbling in the pleasure quarters."

Restaurant owner: "Even cooking, which sells faster than fabric, has no customers, so we can't make a living from banquet business."

【Under Thunder's right arm】
Thunder: "I too turned pale and ran away during this earthquake."

【Second Tier】
Book rental shop: "Indeed, my books are burned, payments uncollected, and this year-end brings only tearful books. I want the night to pass quickly and return to a world of amusing books. The only one who doesn't know this hardship is you, kept woman."

Kept woman: "What do you mean? Since my patron's house burned down completely, I don't get my share, and even food is scarce."

Storyteller: "For that mouth-based income, we used the intimidating presence of our guild members and went out to work, but since the patrons everywhere weren't as responsive as promised, we were met with fan-licking. This too will become material for future stories."

Dance instructor: "With foreign tales, the mansion performances have ceased. In these difficult times, it's fortunate that this time's Fujima and Sho-sama weren't injured at the Nakamura Theater."

【Third Tier】
Props dealer: "Truly, in this earthquake, large and small props were shaken to tiny pieces. The props business is slow, and on top of that, we're buying handle fittings due to urgent umbrella-making needs."

Lecturer: "Juggling both earthquake and fire duties, facing a siege while wandering, nearly falling, but finally managing to get by with evening performances."

Animal dealer: "More than anyone else, we have animals and beasts with no buyers. Perhaps we should become general dealers - at least human hair would sell."

【Under the smoke on the left】
Shamisen shop: "The chest's second tuning is old goods, but now the vital parts are rising in price."

【Fourth Tier】
Haiku master: "Merchants are busy without pause, but haiku poets aren't troubled - with hundred-verse sequences and heavenly principle sellers, without taking rice, with hands to the ground, in these times, one verse suffices."

Beggar: "Well, such business, you rascal, all the mansions we serve have collapsed, but without even servants to speak of, we're just barely staying alive."

Tea master: "Boat-ichi tea and such are skillful, gradually thin tea, if that's visible, tea ceremonies cannot be abandoned."

Street performer: "Who asks? For two days now, I haven't received even one mon - such a great loss. Truly, earthquakes are divine punishment."

【Above the street performer】
Geisha: "The catfish's tail-wagging will have scary consequences."

Paper scrap collector: "I understand there are no paper scraps in the burned areas, but since the earthquake happened at night, there should be paper scraps afterwards."

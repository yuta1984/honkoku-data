[Omitting the overlapping portion from the previous page]
I am submitting reports on various mansion inspections along with
documents recently presented. I have some accounts prepared regarding Fukagawa Honjo and
the Hiroji district or the Yoshiwara area, but
I do not have time to enumerate every inconsequential matter. Regarding the deaths listed in the separate document,
I am truly heartbroken. Donun's body was finally found after eight days had passed.
I went to Noda Seizaemon's hut where my son Michinosuke was
playing go. Seizaemon was watching from the side.
Due to the sudden great earthquake, both father and son
had a storehouse collapse, and then the Meizendo hall collapsed on top of it, and they
escaped by climbing over the pile. As for Donun, he was
trapped under the storehouse
wall. This was truly a momentary
disaster that affected
His Lordship's procession equipment and dining utensils,
most importantly the precious pagoda of Kensoji Temple,
the sacred memorial tablets,
the precious pagoda of Lady Kodaiin, and toward Tameike
the outer enclosure walls, repairs for raising the Niisato long house,
the quarters for inner and outer officials of both residences, long houses—
for those that could not be fully restored, temporary huts were built day and night
continuously for emergency measures. This is by no means
an ordinary matter. I trust
you will understand with your wise judgment. I would like to inquire about various details, but
being especially busy with many affairs and unable to manage everything, first as acknowledgment
please view this hastily written letter. I look forward to hearing from you later.
With fear and respectful words

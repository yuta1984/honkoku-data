...unlike other jurisdictions in the province, we humbly request the benevolent grace of the domain and the established additional rice allowance, as it is truly lamentable that good people have been reduced to abandoning their homes and livelihoods. Therefore, we humbly wish that through your merciful consideration, a long-term loan be graciously granted. Once this is accomplished, we would like to allocate and distribute the loan amount according to each village's needs, and we humbly wish to submit the details of annual installment repayments and other matters in a separate document at a later time. Accordingly, we have attached one ledger for each disaster-affected village and respectfully submit this inquiry. The above.

The above represents the disaster situation in the villages of Takai District and Minochi District in Shinshū Province, under my magistrate's office's temporary administration, caused by the great earthquake on the night of the 24th day of the 3rd month. I urgently report this and immediately dispatched my assistants and clerks, while I myself toured the villages to inspect the disaster conditions.

What I witnessed was truly beyond words—a bizarre and terrifying sight that was unbearable to behold. The ground had split open from 7-8 sun to 5-6 shaku in width, opening in linear patterns extending dozens of ken each. From these cracks, massive amounts of black and red-colored muddy water gushed forth, making many areas impassable on foot. Additionally, landslides of earth, sand, snow, and water occurred in various places, large rocks tumbled down, and the terrain was completely transformed with extensive land damage visible. The villages' irrigation channels collapsed and were severely damaged in many places, or became misaligned, resulting in many villages where water could not flow and irrigation was cut off. As for mountain streams, large rocks and earth and sand were pushed out, areas were buried by the tremors or collapsed and severely damaged, blocking water flow and causing overflow across wide areas with muddy water rushing forth. Regarding collapsed houses, all the house rows were flattened and crushed.

There were landslides that blocked the river, causing it to be cut off with no flowing water at all. The ferry crossing at Tanbashima dried up completely, allowing people to cross on foot. As for the situation in Echigo Province, I do not know well how things stand there.
The above is based on rumors only, and since the details are not yet clear, I will immediately dispatch my deputy to inspect and investigate the collapsed houses and other damage in my administrative territory. After examining the damage in the nearby villages based on these reports, I will submit a detailed report later. Regarding the villages of Saku District in the same province attached to the domain's administrative compound, they also experienced the same great earthquake, but perhaps because they are some distance away from Zenkōji temple, the damage appears to have lessened accordingly. While there are reports of minor damage to houses in the administrative compound, jurisdictional areas, and other nearby private domain villages, there are no serious impediments, so for now

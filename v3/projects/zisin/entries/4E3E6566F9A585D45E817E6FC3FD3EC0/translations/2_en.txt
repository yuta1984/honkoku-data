On the night of the 2nd day of the 10th month of Ansei 2 (1855), Year of the Rabbit, around the Hour of the Boar (approximately 10 PM), a great earthquake struck from the southeast direction, causing major destruction within a four-ri radius of Edo. Fires broke out in various places and spread, with casualties and fatalities beyond description. However, that very night, relief meals were distributed to the destitute people from the town magistrate's office, so those who survived did not go hungry. This was truly the benevolent grace of a peaceful era, a most grateful thing.

Furthermore, relief huts were constructed for those who became destitute and homeless, and meals were distributed three times daily at the following locations:
　　Outside Saiwai Bridge Gate　　In front of Asakusa Thunder Gate　　Fukagawa Seaside Shinden

Generally, from Naka-no-chō in all four directions within the quarter, everything burned without exception. The notice board outside the Great Gate and the same side remained, while the opposite side burned completely. At Nihon Embankment, the ground of the thoroughfare cracked. Within the quarter, not a single storehouse remained unshaken and collapsed, and with fires on top of that, the injured and dead were beyond counting.

From there, a fire broke out in Ta-chō, and at the same place in the 1st district, Sodesuri Inari shrine and the northern part of the Amigasa teahouse below the embankment remained slightly, though most became collapsed houses. In the western part of the same area, in Yanaka, at the front of Tennōji temple, two temples - the Batō Kannon of Yamakawa-chō and Saihōji - remained. From Baji-dōri in the southern part of the same area, it burned into Kita-Shinchō, including Henshōin and across from it, Saruwaka-chō 3rd district's Kawarasaki, 2nd district's Ichimura, and 1st district's Nakamura - all three theater troupes' front and back dressing rooms and actors' residences burned together. However, north of Morita Kanya's residence in the 3rd district remained.

From there, Yabu-no-uchi had little remaining due to earthquake collapse and fires. In the eastern part of the same area, beyond Kuhonji temple at Yama-no-shuku remained. Going south, seven-tenths of the Tozawa tenements in Hanakawado-chō burned before stopping. In the western side of Umamichi in the same area: Kisshōin, Tokuōin, Enmyōin, Seishin-in, Fudōin, Kyōzen-in up to North Umamichi, and South Umamichi up to the corner, all burned.

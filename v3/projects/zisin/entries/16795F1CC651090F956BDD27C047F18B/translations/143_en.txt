The above charitable donations were provided, and among the parishioners there were about 17 immediate deaths.
The bodies were sent in long chests or sake barrels, and
depending on their status, coffins were purchased at our own expense for burial, and memorial service fees
were also provided free of charge due to the temple's busy circumstances during this period.
Regardless of the above, for the meritorious act of conducting proper burials, on the 21st day of this 11th month,
we were summoned to the office of Lord Ōta Settsu-no-kami and received
3 pieces of silver as a reward.

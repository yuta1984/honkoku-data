Regarding the recent earthquake, temples and shrine families 
provided relief to the people in the city, 
and there were those who received official commendation 
for their admirable deeds. However, excluding the matter of 
commendation based on their legitimate status, 
we would like you to extract one or two examples 
of cases where silver money was granted 
or praise was bestowed solely for providing 
relief to the people in the city. We respectfully inquire about this matter.

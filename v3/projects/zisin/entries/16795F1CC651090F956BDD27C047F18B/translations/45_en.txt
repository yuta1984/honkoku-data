Anei 2, Year of the Snake, Fifth Month
　Regarding disciplinary matters for retainers of samurai houses: up to severe reprimands may be handled at the discretion of the master, but confinement and above require official inquiry. There are precedents for this from the past, and although this has been the practice, when investigating whether there should be fundamental principles governing such matters, no clear guidelines were found. Therefore, upon consulting with the Yamamoto Shinano-no-kami office, a copy of these records was provided. This is kept for future reference.

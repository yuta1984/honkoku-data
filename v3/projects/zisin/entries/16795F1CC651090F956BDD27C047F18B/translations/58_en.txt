10th month, 27th day, Year of the Rabbit

1. Yoshigorō, the general representative of the monthly administrators of Ikenohata Shichiken-chō and six other districts, reported: Due to the earthquake on the 2nd day of this month, the various districts suffered building collapses and great hardship. In response, Lord Matsudaira Ōkura-no-taifu bestowed 30 koku, 5 to, and 5 shō of unpolished rice as charitable relief to the said district, as well as to Yokochō of the same area and the temple precincts of five other temples. We are deeply grateful for this benevolence. The aforementioned Yoshigorō, headman, reports this matter for official record.

The above temple provided free funeral services on the 5th of the same month for five parishioners (men and women) who died unnaturally due to the earthquake on the night of the 2nd of last month. As a result, they were summoned to the office of Ōta Settsu-no-kami, Commissioner of Temples and Shrines, on the 22nd of the same month and commended for this admirable act.

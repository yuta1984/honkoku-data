The above concerns the recent great earthquake in the government territory, where many people in various towns were crushed to death. For those deceased who had no one to claim their bodies, each town district brought them to Ekō-in Temple for funeral services. For all those brought for funeral services this time, no funeral fees were charged and burial services with memorial prayers were conducted. This arrangement was also reported to and approved by the magistrate's office, and all the townspeople are deeply grateful for this.

Regarding the collapse of the high mountains called Ōubasan and Mushikuradake that extend to Munashi Village and others, which occurred due to seismic activity on the same night - recently a passageway was finally established, and when I conducted an inspection, I found that these nine villages suffered particularly severe disasters. Moreover, the five villages of Iori Village, Wasao Village, Umeki Village, Kyōhara Village, and Nenbutsuji Village are located close to the foot of these mountains. Within these villages, in Nenbutsuji Village: Hirasawa Group and Garyun Group; in Umeki Village: Shironokoshi Group and Oyasawa Group; in Jikyōhara Village: Fujisawa Group and Yokomichi Group; in Iori Village: Ōta Group; and in Takafuku Village: Kurimoto Group - a total of eleven groups - seventy private houses, 199 people, and thirty horses were completely buried in the earth without a trace, and most of these groups became devastated areas. Furthermore, regarding the nearby villages, out of forty-four houses and 235 people, only five collapsed houses remained, while the other thirty-nine houses, more than sixty people, and six horses, as well as in Yamadanaka Village, thirty-nine houses and twelve people were also buried in the earth without a trace, becoming devastated areas. Due to such circumstances, the ground changes, collapsed houses, and deaths in the nearby villages are extraordinarily numerous, though the investigation has not yet been completed. Unlike villages in flat areas, these aforementioned villages are separated by mountain paths, with cultivated land unsuitably spread over high ground, making everything difficult to access. Moreover, these areas are normally treacherous terrain, dense with rocks and boulders, as difficult to traverse as walking step by step. With this great disaster, the original road formations have been destroyed, so detailed inspections cannot be conducted for the time being. This is truly lamentable and distressing, so I have ordered relief measures in coordination with nearby villages that have not suffered severe disasters.

However, since most of it consists of large rocks, it appears that the water current cannot possibly wash it away. As a result, water is gradually accumulating and may reach about seven to eight jō above normal water level. This has caused several villages to become submerged, with the area resembling tidal waters. Of course, I have ordered various countermeasures, but since it involves a large mountain with rocks particularly pushed in, human efforts cannot adequately address the situation.

In the villages of Minochi District under my jurisdiction, there were reportedly many collapsed houses, injured people, and deaths, but no formal reports have been submitted yet. From rumors I have been hearing, in the same province's river...

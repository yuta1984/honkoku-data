　　　Request for leave to return to domain　May 23rd　delivered by Fukao Kogenta

In my domain of Iiyama in Shinano Province, due to the great earthquake on the night of March 24th of this year, the residential quarters within the castle, turrets, gates, stone walls, and numerous other locations collapsed and were damaged. Moreover, throughout the samurai residences, castle town, and the entire domain there was destruction, fires, landslides, and fields and paddies became wasteland. Furthermore, on the night of the 13th of last month, the Chikuma River suddenly flooded, causing extensive water damage. The details are as I have previously reported step by step. Regarding this matter, I have ordered the officials stationed in my domain to handle reconstruction work both inside and outside the castle and throughout the countryside, and they are to quickly provide instructions to each area. However, this disaster has resulted in numerous deaths and injuries throughout the region, with many people and horses affected, making it difficult to provide adequate manpower for reconstruction and agriculture. The domain is facing inevitable severe hardship, and the local officials have all expressed their bewilderment, causing me great distress. Therefore, if I were to go to my domain and provide direct instructions myself, there would be means for reconstruction and village relief efforts, and it would also enable us to devote full effort to agricultural work throughout the region. Although June is the proper time for me to receive leave, I earnestly request that I be granted leave to return to my domain at this time. I humbly submit this request. The above.

Regarding our lodging arrangements, both the earthquake and our two attendants caused no harm as we evacuated safely, and we were able to take back the post-horse certificates, so
　　there are no particular problems. This was truly an unprecedented great earthquake, and the rice fields and farmland cracked open, with some places where
　　large amounts of water gushed out. Regarding the construction work at Shiozaki Village, the stone embankments and such have mostly collapsed, and the Chikuma River
　　has risen two shaku above normal water levels, but if there are no further disturbances, we believe there should be no exceptional
　　flooding. This is not limited to Shiozaki Village - throughout the neighboring areas there appear to be many collapsed houses and
　　injured people, and during the great earthquake, fires broke out in all directions near and far.
　　Among these, Inariyama post station and Zenkoji town appeared to be burning until this morning, but
　　from last night until now, day and night, earthquakes have rumbled dozens of times, causing tremors so severe that
　　walls have fallen. Moreover, regarding the Sai River, it appears that landslides occurred upstream, and since the great earthquake,
　　no water has flowed at all up to now. Therefore, within a day or two there will likely be major flooding
　　somewhere, and consequently people along that river as well as those at the relay stations are fleeing one after another. Regarding these
　　unusual events, we submit this report. The above.

Mud and sand erupted from several cracks in the fields and paddies, rushing into the cultivated land. Subsequently, landslides occurred in nearby territories within the domain, burying and damming the Sai River, causing water to gradually accumulate to a depth of several dozen jō. Then, on the evening of the 13th of last month, the aforementioned location suddenly collapsed again, causing a sudden flood that inundated not only the villages along the rivers in my domain but also nearby villages throughout the entire area. Although I had previously ordered various flood prevention measures to be put in place, the water flow was particularly strong during the night, resulting in houses being swept away and drowning deaths. The details are as I have previously reported step by step. Although the floodwaters have since receded, there are countless locations where fields and paddies have been lost or will become permanently barren, and detailed investigations have not yet been completed. Particularly in the villages that were flooded, most clothing and household goods were swept away, and stored grains that had been saved were either rotted by water or swept away, causing immediate food shortages and threatening to lead to famine. This unexpected disaster has caused great hardship, naturally creating unrest among the people. I have ordered the utmost relief efforts, including daily food distribution, and have arranged for other villages to provide assistance with rice straw and rice seedlings. I wish to remain and oversee matters until I can at least roughly confirm that the fields and paddies are showing signs of recovery. However, this year is my scheduled year for sankin-kōtai attendance, and as instructed this spring, I am supposed to proceed to Edo in the sixth month. But as described above, I am extremely concerned that relief efforts for the impoverished people and maintaining order cannot be adequately managed by my retainers alone if I proceed to Edo. Therefore, if it would be possible, I would like to request the extraordinary indulgence of postponing my departure to Edo until this autumn. I deeply apologize for this selfish request, but if such permission could be granted, relief efforts would be able to proceed properly, so if there would be no objection...

Regarding my domain of Matsumoto in Shinano Province, about which I previously submitted a report: starting from around the fourth hour of the night on March 24th, there were strong earthquakes. From the 25th onward, though nothing particularly serious occurred and [the earthquakes] gradually became less frequent, they have not completely ceased even now. The damage from these intermittent tremors is as follows:

- Various roof damage, tiles, and wall collapses throughout the castle grounds, excluding the main fortifications
- Wall collapses at various samurai residences and storehouses
- Two completely collapsed storehouses in the castle town (including sake brewing warehouses)
- Two half-collapsed storehouses  
- Two collapsed storage buildings
- Rice fields and dry fields totaling over 579 koku of land rendered barren
- Eighty-nine ground fissures (spanning 6,445 ken in total length, ranging from 4-5 sun to 2 ken in width)
- One hundred thirty-seven damaged roads (totaling 32,033 ken in length)
- One thousand four hundred seventy-seven landslides, large and small
- Forty-one collapses of valley dams caused by the same geological disruption
- Twenty-eight thousand four hundred eight fallen trees, large and small
- Forty-nine collapsed bridges, large and small
- Seventy-three breached irrigation channels (totaling 900 ken in length)
- Twenty-eight houses flooded due to the damming of the Sai River
- Three collapsed shrines... this item should be written before "collapsed worship halls" in the proper order
- Three hundred ninety-six collapsed houses in the rural areas

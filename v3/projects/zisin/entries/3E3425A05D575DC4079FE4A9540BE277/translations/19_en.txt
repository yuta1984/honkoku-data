Regarding the villages in Kubiki County, Echigo Province under the custody of Sakakibara Shikibu-taiyu: There were reports of collapsed houses and deaths due to the great earthquake on the night of the 24th of last month, which I reported in advance. Since the tremors continued intermittently afterward, all officials have been conducting government business from temporary huts made with reed screens. However, there was another great earthquake around noon on the 29th of last month, with reports of collapsed houses, deaths, and rice seedling fields being buried in soil. Additionally, there were reports that government rice being transported downstream and stored in the back town of Imamachi port was all damaged and the rice bags scattered. I immediately dispatched officials to investigate. From the 24th to the 29th, not a drop of rain fell, but from the dawn of the last day of the month, heavy rain began, followed by occasional strong winds, and it is reported that sleet fell in the upstream villages. While I will report the details later, I am submitting this preliminary report. The above.

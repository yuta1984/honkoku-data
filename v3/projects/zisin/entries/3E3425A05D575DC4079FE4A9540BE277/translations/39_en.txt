As well as the long houses, stables, meeting halls, rice storehouses, etc., most collapsed, with fires breaking out in various places. The castle town similarly collapsed and was completely burned down. In the villages of the domain, many houses collapsed and caught fire, with numerous landslides causing villages to be covered in mud. Most of the rice fields and other farmlands are expected to become permanently barren. Particularly, hundreds of locations of irrigation pipes and weirs suffered major damage, and even if repairs were undertaken, there are many places where it would be difficult to calculate whether they would be useful. However, since some of these villages are in remote locations, I will report the details later. Also, on the night of the 13th, the Chikuma River suddenly flooded, rising 1 jō 3 shaku above normal water level, with water rushing into villages along the river, apparently causing extensive flood damage. Due to the disasters mentioned above, there have been numerous deaths. Regarding this, I wish to immediately order repairs as well as food relief for retainers, townspeople, and impoverished people in the domain. However, my personal finances have suffered from consecutive years of crop failures and poor harvests, and furthermore, the year before last (1869), due to a fire from the Aoyama area, all of the lower residence was lost, and weapon storehouses were also destroyed by the spreading fire, creating an extremely difficult situation. Due to the circumstances described above, I have ordered minimal emergency measures, but this is an enormous matter that is far beyond my personal means, leaving me greatly troubled and distressed. Therefore, although I am deeply ashamed to make such a request during these times, I humbly ask that you grant me special compassion and authorize a loan of 10,000 ryō. I respectfully submit this request. The above.

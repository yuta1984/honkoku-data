As for the villages along the mountain streams and rivers, needless to say, regarding the matter of the Kawanakajima area, as reported this time, all the old embankments for flood control have been washed away. We are deeply concerned about what kind of flood damage may occur, as it is difficult to predict. We have ordered the utmost preparation for further measures.

Moreover, the farmland in the Yanagikubo group of the divided land of Shikaya Village has collapsed, and water has accumulated in that valley stream. Although it is only a thin stream, if that location breaks after several dozen days, it was reported that this would also become a serious disaster. Therefore, we immediately sent out an inspection. While we will report the details later, we first report this matter. End of report.

This is an extremely serious matter, and many of the administered territories are in similar situations. Particularly regarding Zenkoji Temple, the residential buildings collapsed due to the earthquake and subsequently caught fire, with everything except the main hall and mountain gate completely burned down, and the casualties were especially numerous. I immediately dispatched retainers and ordered immediate relief measures including rice, grain, and laborers. Generally speaking, my domain has no scattered territories and is consolidated as one continuous area connected to the castle, but there were no villages that escaped this disaster. However, in the mountain areas, water has accumulated in the Sai River and many roads have collapsed extensively, making travel impossible in many places. While detailed investigations have been difficult to conduct, according to what we have been able to investigate up until the 10th, from the castle town to the mountain villages, there are approximately 8,747 completely or partially destroyed houses, approximately 3,924 dead and injured people, and approximately 235 dead cattle and horses. Given these circumstances, villages without deaths or house collapses are very few, which is extremely lamentable. Of course, I have ordered the utmost efforts in rescue and relief measures, but just as we are approaching the rice seedling season and the crucial time for wheat harvesting, while the earthquakes have gradually become lighter, the tremors still occur dozens of times and continue to this day. The farmers are overwhelmed by fear and grief, lost and bewildered. Therefore, I have dispatched officials to provide care and comfort, but people cannot settle down peacefully. Moreover, regarding the Kawanakajima plain, the Sai River water has accumulated with no flow, causing problems with irrigation water and even leading to famine - a situation beyond description. Nevertheless, this cannot be abandoned, and I am concerned that there might be misconceptions among the people regarding this crisis. Therefore, to calm people's hearts and enable everyone to undertake recovery measures and relief efforts as much as possible,

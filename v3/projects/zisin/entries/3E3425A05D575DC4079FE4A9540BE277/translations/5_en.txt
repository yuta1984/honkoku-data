From the Kawanakajima area to Zenkoji Temple, and from there toward the south in the area called Sanchu, there appears to have been a severe earthquake near the villages of this district. In the Kawanakajima area, there are villages where all the private houses in entire villages burned down without exception. In one village, from about 340 people, some 200 to 300 people died instantly or were injured. In Zenkoji town, all the rows of houses collapsed from shaking and then burned down, resulting in a tremendous number of instant deaths and injuries. Since the entire highway area had numerous travelers staying overnight for Zenkoji memorial services, there were reportedly many deaths. The mountain areas are remote and isolated, so the situation is difficult to understand, but there was a mountain collapse at the Sai River embankment, causing the Kawanakajima area to have no flowing water at all, and the Tanba-jima ferry crossing dried up, making it possible to cross on foot. Regarding the situation in Echigo Province, I do not know how things stand there, as the situation is unclear. The above is only based on rumors and cannot be confirmed, so I am immediately dispatching an agent to inspect and investigate the collapsed houses and other damage in my jurisdictional areas, and will also investigate rumors about losses in other nearby villages. I will report the details later. Regarding the villages of Saku District in the same province attached to the domain camp, there was similarly a great earthquake, but they are separated by considerable distance from the Zenkoji area. At this camp and in my jurisdictional areas and other nearby private domain villages, there are some minor damaged houses, but nothing serious, and there are no injured or dead. I urgently submit this report first. The above.

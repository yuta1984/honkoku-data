locations, the town areas, and also the peasant houses in the domain villages suffered similarly, with particularly numerous collapsed and damaged houses in riverside villages. Furthermore, mud and sand erupted from several hundred locations where fields cracked, or ground elevation differences appeared. All small rivers had their riverbeds rise higher, causing water to overflow into cultivated land and remain stagnant for several days, resulting in all crops of the current season rotting from water damage. Particularly, among the riverside villages in the domain, Watauchi Village is located at the confluence of the Sai River and Chikuma River. Upstream, there were landslides that dammed the flowing water, and the water level increased daily, creating stagnant water. Whether dammed or when it becomes overflow water, not only the aforementioned Watauchi Village but also the downstream riverside villages are all in low-lying locations, so it is difficult to predict whether they might be swept away. For the elderly, young, and infirm people, we have constructed all relief huts and provided food, drink, and other care. We have dispatched officials to these villages and are making every effort to prepare defenses. Since then, though there are variations in intensity, earthquakes continue day and night countless times, and the flowing water dammed by the landslide upstream of the Sai River increases daily. From the hour of the Monkey on the 13th, the western mountains have been shaking frequently, causing us worry. We have further dispatched retainers and auxiliary laborers for defense and are arranging evacuations of the elderly and young. Meanwhile, the dammed location on the Sai River was suddenly broken through by water pressure, and due to the water that had been stagnant for several days, a water surge of approximately two jō rushed forth in an instant. Although the riverside villages in our domain had made advance preparations, because it was nighttime and particularly rapid current, not only were houses swept away, but there were also drowning victims. We hear that the loss and damage to fields is considerable, but since the water has not yet completely receded, investigations cannot be thorough. Moreover, there are reportedly two or three locations dammed by landslides, and we cannot predict whether they will gradually break through or what might happen next.

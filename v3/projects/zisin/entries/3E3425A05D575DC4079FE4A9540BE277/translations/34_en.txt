I am in great distress. The relief measures for these various areas cannot be delayed, and since the 24th of last month, there have been continuous enormous expenses. This is an urgent matter causing difficulties, and in the local area and its vicinity, there are no means to procure funds. Particularly, as written above, the continuous enormous expenses have accumulated, and in this time of mounting hardship, this unprecedented natural disaster has occurred, requiring immediate relief measures for the people. However, given the circumstances described above, it is difficult to manage adequately, causing me great distress and confusion. Therefore, although I am deeply ashamed to make this request, if it is possible, with special compassion, I humbly wish to borrow 2,000 ryō of gold at this time. If this request is granted, not only will it relieve the urgent difficulties in various areas, but it will also enable us to provide care so that the people of numerous villages will not suffer from starvation, which I believe would be a most fortunate outcome despite these difficult circumstances. Regarding the repayment of this loan, given the serious nature of the situation for which I request this borrowed money, I will arrange repayment according to your instructions. I humbly request that you grant this request with your compassionate consideration. The above.

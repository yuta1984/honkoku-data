Many villages have experienced collapses and major damage, or foundation displacement, resulting in no water flow and irrigation systems becoming intermittent. In valleys and streams, large stones and earth and sand have been pushed out, buried by the earthquake, collapsing and severely damaging various locations, blocking water flow, and muddy water has swept across the entire flat areas.

Regarding the collapsed houses, all house rows were flattened by crushing, with joints of girders and beams, center posts, and other structural elements and fixtures broken and shattered, and household goods and various tools completely destroyed. In the kitchens where people had stored provisions, some areas were also buried under earth and sand that had been pushed in.

When I first made my rounds, in all villages, not only the small landowners but even the village officials had lost their composure, having no knowledge whatsoever of cleanup or restoration, with each family sitting in front of their collapsed homes, making no provisions whatsoever for shelter from rain and dew, simply at a complete loss and in a daze. When they saw me, they became agitated and wept profusely, unable to stop crying and becoming distraught, unable to answer when questioned, lying prostrate. The elderly and young, men and women of the small landowner class were crying and wailing, and the injured were in great numbers, collapsed and suffering in pain—a situation impossible to fully describe, extremely pitiful, causing me to sigh with grief.

All villages were in similar circumstances. Even those who had provisions for daily meals readily available found them under collapsed houses, particularly covered with muddy water and difficult to extract. As for the small landowners and others who had no provisions for daily meals, and also for drinking water which they had been using from irrigation channels that had become mixed with muddy water, they were suffering from hunger and thirst. While some neighboring villages could generally help each other, I have been implementing relief measures for daily meal provisions as much as possible at present, but with over a hundred villages involved, my personal resources cannot reach the point of providing overall relief measures. Even those who were financially stable have encountered the disaster of collapsed houses and cannot particularly help each other.

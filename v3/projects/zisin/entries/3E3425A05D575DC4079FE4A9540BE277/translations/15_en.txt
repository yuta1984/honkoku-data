The number of deaths was countless. Approximately thirty-some travelers who had been staying at the Nyorai Hall managed to evacuate safely, but their clothing, travel money, and other belongings were all lost to fire. People from distant provinces were particularly in distress. Only the Nyorai Hall and the main gate remained, while the rest of the town was completely burned down, as we have been told. Regarding the dead, the numbers are impossible to determine, but rumors say there were twenty to thirty thousand deaths in Zenkoji town alone. Among the registered residents of that town, only about two to three hundred remained on the morning of the 25th according to rumors, but even this number is uncertain as some may have fled, making it impossible to estimate even roughly. In any case, it was a tremendous disaster.

Item: Regarding Inariyama in Ueda domain, a neighboring post town to the west of Shiozaki Village, houses collapsed and then fires broke out, burning everything down completely. There were countless immediate deaths among travelers and others, but the exact numbers are unknown here as well. Rumors speak of two to three thousand deaths. Other post towns and villages that suffered fires also had many immediate deaths.

Item: Regarding the Sai River in Shinano Province, the water flow stopped during the great earthquake on the night of the 24th, and there was no flowing water until we departed from that area around noon on the 26th. Previously, there had been a cantilever bridge in the Minochi Village area, about seven to eight ri from Tanba Island post town, but landslides in the surrounding areas blocked the Sai River. It was difficult to determine when or where fires broke out, and people from relay stations along the river gradually fled. As a result, officials were dispatched from Ueda and Matsushiro to the highways, and travel toward Zenkoji was prohibited. According to rumors, the dammed water of the Sai River formed tide-like waters around Matsumoto in Shinano Province, the water burst open toward a place called Kikyogahara, then flowed into Lake Suwa and eventually into the Tenryu River.

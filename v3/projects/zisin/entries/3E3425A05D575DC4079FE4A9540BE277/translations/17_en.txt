There were no collapsed houses or deaths, but all the wooden fixtures were damaged by the tremors, and with dozens of tremors occurring day and night, everyone was sleeping outdoors. From there, we traveled three ri to Ueda domain, where conditions were even lighter, though people were still sleeping outdoors day and night. Two and a half ri from there was Komoro post town, and three ri further to the Oiwake area on the Nakasendo highway, there was no mountain rumbling or severe shaking - the great earthquake was only occasional slight tremors. From there, crossing Usui Pass toward Edo, there was a considerable earthquake on the night of the 24th, but there have been no earthquakes since then. This is a rough account as written of the major incident we inspected during our official duties. We believe detailed reports will be submitted progressively from each location. The above.

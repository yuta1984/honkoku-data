付けの件でございますが, regarding the expenses, starting with castle repairs, the costs for the retainer households, castle town, river administration, and rural areas across the domain are enormous, and we simply cannot manage adequately. Moreover, we are extremely worried and perplexed about what will become of the changed terrain along the Sai River. Although I am terribly sorry to trouble you during these times, since this is beyond our own capabilities, I would like to request that you graciously grant us a loan of 20,000 ryō in gold out of your special compassion. I have no choice but to make this request. The above.
　　April 12th　　　　　　　　　Sanada Shinano-no-kami

At my domain in Shinshū Matsushiro, as I previously reported, due to the great earthquake, Mount Iwakura in Yamahirabayashi Village, Sarashina District, collapsed and slid into the Sai River, creating dams at two locations where water had gradually accumulated to dozens of jō in depth. Although it had been leaking for the past day or two, where the water had risen at the lower dam site was still over two jō deep when it suddenly appeared to burst through. Yesterday on the 13th after 7 PM, that mountain area shook violently, followed by the loud sound of rushing rapids, and suddenly torrential water burst into the river channel, immediately breaking through or overflowing the earthen embankments on both sides, with flood control measures proving inadequate, as river officials have been continuously reporting. Soon after, water flooded dozens of villages throughout the Kawanakajima area, flowing into and backing up the Chikuma River, with water already rising heavily up to near the residential castle. From evening until around 9 PM, the Chikuma River rose approximately two jō above normal water levels, affecting not only Kawanakajima but also Takai District

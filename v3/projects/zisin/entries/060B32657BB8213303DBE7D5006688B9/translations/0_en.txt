I respectfully write to you. Though we are in a period of severe cold, I trust you are in good health, which brings me great joy. Fortunately, we are all well here too. Please do not worry about trivial matters.

As usual, I am sending 10 yen as allowance money for old mother Tanaka via the attached postal money order. Please receive it.

How was your area affected by the great earthquake of the 27th of last month? Out of great concern, I hastily send this postcard to inquire about your situation. According to subsequent rumors, this earthquake was strongest along the Tōkaidō, particularly in the three provinces of Mino, Owari, and our Tōtōmi, which were at the epicenter. Other regions were not so severely affected, and I heard that areas like Chūgoku and Kyūshū experienced only slight tremors, which relieved me.

As you will gradually learn from newspapers and official reports, the devastation in Mino and Owari cannot possibly be fully described on paper. According to direct accounts from a friend who was there and witnessed the earthquake firsthand, in places like Gifu and Ōgaki in Mino, the tremors and house collapses occurred almost simultaneously, leaving no time for evacuation. For example, an entire family of a prosecutor at Ōgaki Court died, and a district head's entire household was crushed to death - all due to having no time to escape. Both Gifu city and Ōgaki city were about 90% destroyed, and in Owari, more than half of Nagoya city collapsed like dominoes.

Since the 27th, there have been dozens of strong and weak tremors every day and night. As a result, people rarely stay in their houses, and most spread mats outside while surviving on rice balls provided through the prefectural officials' efforts. Though it is a natural disaster, it is extremely pitiful and terrifying.

Regarding our Tōtōmi region, rumors in Tokyo and Osaka make it sound as if we suffered earthquake damage similar to Nagoya. I receive so many inquiry letters from friends in Tokyo, Osaka and elsewhere that I am overwhelmed trying to reply to each one. In reality, it is not as bad as rumored. Not a single house collapsed in Hamamatsu city. While we could not avoid some damage, there were only a few deaths in the surrounding areas.

My residence is an official building, and perhaps because of its solid construction, there was no particular damage - only some household items fell and broke. However, in our region too, several tremors continue day and night since the 27th, and there were occasional tremors until last night. This has left thousands of people uneasy. The only stroke of luck at this time is the presence of travelers. Because westbound trains are not fully operational, many passengers are temporarily stranded in Hamamatsu, bringing great prosperity to inns. Next in benefit are the rickshaw pullers.

However, last night there was tremendous rain and thunder late at night, and this morning became clear. I speculate that there will probably be no more tremors.

This covers the essential matters for now.

In closing, please give my regards to your family and old mother Tanaka as well.

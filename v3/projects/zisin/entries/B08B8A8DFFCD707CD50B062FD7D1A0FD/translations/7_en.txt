Abbreviated Map of Mount Atago

Mount Atago is located in the northwest of Kadono District, Yamashiro Province. From the first torii gate in Saga to the main shrine, there is a treacherous path of fifty chō (approximately 5.5 km). The bridge crossing the Kiyotaki River from Kokoromi-no-saka is named Toen Bridge. Shikimi-ga-hara is at the northern foot of the mountain, and Nanseihō refers to the peak in the inui (northwest) direction. Hiuchi Gongen is located at the seventeenth chō mark.

The Main Shrine Daigongen is Japan's first war deity, a revered shrine protecting the imperial capital and the foremost shrine for fire suppression throughout the provinces. In the first year of Ten'ō era (781) during Emperor Kōnin's reign, the monk Keishun received an imperial edict to establish this shrine.

The mountain rises in the inui (northwest) of the royal capital (Kyoto), with white clouds encircling its waist. The main hall and subsidiary shrines face tatsumi (southeast) toward the rising sun, overlooking the myriad households of Heian-kyō.

The divine authority shines across all borders of Japan, both great and small, benefiting all living beings, encouraging good and punishing evil, as we understand from venerating the divine oracle. Therefore, while we shall not discuss the unfathomable changes of heaven, earth, yin and yang for now, avoiding calamities from past karma and present self-inflicted disasters depends entirely on faith in Gongen's divine oracle.

**Oracle of Mount Atago Daigongen:**
"When sentient beings constantly defile the world's fire, harboring selfish thoughts and opposing heaven and earth, I always dispatch fire-chaos deities to burn away their impurities. When the upper classes are wealthy while the lower suffer, I rain fire upon their mansions, scattering the wealth of the rich to give to the suffering. Since I constantly protect royal law and guard national security, I burn down the houses of those with heretical views. Do not think of being satisfied in your heart. Heaven diminishes what is full, and I diminish human arrogance."

**Note:**
When people of the world venerate the sacred precincts of Ise of the divine wind and journey back, they must visit Gongen of this mountain, and there is a reason for this.

The Ise shrine is the deity of the sun and represents the origin of Japan (Hi-no-moto). This mountain is the deity of fire and represents the origin of fire. Since sun (hi) and fire (hi) are of the same nature and substance, those making pilgrimage to Ise, in reverence and respect for the clear blessings of Amaterasu's illuminating sun, should climb this mountain on their return journey to cleanse the dirty and defiled fire in their hearts. They should deeply pray for Gongen's protection, fear and respect the divine favor of the fire they use daily, not neglect even the smallest flame, purify the fire in their hearts, and visit to preserve and protect it eternally.

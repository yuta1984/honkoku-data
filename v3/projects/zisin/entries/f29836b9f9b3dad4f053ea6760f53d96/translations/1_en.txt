　　　Statement

Regarding the ashigaru armor that we
left with Sanoya Harusuke on October 20th,
the repairs have been completed and we have paid for and received the items.

On the 27th of the same month, the gun
that we left with Tada Tsuneumon,
gunsmith Yasohachi, and metalworker
Matajuro has been repaired and we have paid for and received it.

Since the laborers who rush to fires
no longer need to go out for these respective items,
we humbly request that you make appropriate
arrangements regarding this matter. That is all.

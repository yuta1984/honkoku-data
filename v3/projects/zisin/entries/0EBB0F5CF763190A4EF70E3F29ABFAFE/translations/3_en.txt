Perhaps they forgot their illnesses. Here is a mad poem by an old man:

Events of the second day of the seventh month of Kanoe-Tora [1830] - From the first half of the Hour of the Monkey [around 3 PM], the earthquake was violent
At first people gathered together chanting "world renewal" - Panicking, [calling out] "Kuwabara" and [offering] incense
The walls of townhouse storehouses immediately fell - Temple and shrine walls and fences collapsed along with their pillars  
Old women cried out prayers to Buddha in shrill voices - Grandfathers prayed to the gods with pale faces
Farmers abandoned their hoes and all fled to the thickets - Boatmen abandoned their boats and climbed alone onto the embankments
Heaven and earth shook with no remedy - The commotion of high and low darkened all directions

Dust clouds obscured the sky. In the midst of this, everything just kept shaking murkily without end.
People wandered about as if their souls had been stolen, their hearts chilled with terror, bewildered.
It was only natural that they panicked and made a commotion. On the night of the second day, trying to spend the night on the main roads, but
thinking of exposure to the night air,
they made roofs from boards, stretched ropes across,
and covered them with straw mats - all of Kyoto stayed up through the night. In each district
they erected high-hanging lanterns with great care, hung portable lanterns along the rows of houses,
wore battle helmets on their heads and chest protectors on their bodies.

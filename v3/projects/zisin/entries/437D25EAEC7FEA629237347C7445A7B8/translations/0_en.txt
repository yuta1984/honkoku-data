Illustration of Camping Outdoors After the Earthquake

[Dialogue written on sliding doors serving as ceiling:]
"I was teaching the child arithmetic when that commotion happened!"

After the February disaster, small fires spread everywhere.
After the earthquake passed, the transport fee became one shu. For fire prevention purposes, since days have passed, there's nothing to be done.

The master wants to settle down at the village house.

[Dialogue written in the passageway:]
"On the night of the earthquake, there was no roof, so no matter how much heaven and earth shook, my sleeves did not fear getting wet with dew."

[Dialogue written on makeshift thatched door panels at bottom right:]
"Still, it's fortunate that it's not raining."
"What do you mean? They say when it rains once, the earthquakes will stop, so a light shower wouldn't hurt."

Ōta Dōkan composed a poem about this situation:
"If it doesn't shake, it won't get wet, but after the great earthquake, the village rain falls on the field camp."

[Song lyrics inside the paper screen panel:]
The earthquake commotion still hasn't settled our nerves, so we'd like to have a drink. What? We can't be patient, so let's not put it in that teapot. What? We can't see the sake flask either.
Oh well, let's have it cold. "No sake flask in the field camp teapot" - this is exactly what that means.

[Article in lower half of image:]
On the night of the second day of the tenth month of Ansei 2 (Year of the Rabbit), at the fourth hour, the earth shook greatly, mountains collapsed, rivers were buried, houses were crushed, buildings toppled, boats rowing along the shore drifted in the waves, and travelers on the road didn't know where to set their feet. Moreover, fierce fires broke out from all directions, with countless injured and dead, and frequent aftershocks continued to come, so people trembled in fear.

Even normally locked and secured houses and storehouses were abandoned in darkness, with some carrying wicker baskets like Goroemon, others like Shimaya's clerk carrying pots, housewives with their mats, and servant girls like Osan carrying their cosmetic boxes - whenever crows cawed ominously they would run out, and when things seemed better they would flee again, spreading doors and laying out tatami mats in squares and vacant lots here and there. Under the shade of trees, instead of flowers, they made lodgings with stars as their host.

Without even thatched roofs and with bamboo pillars lacking elegance, makeshift folding screens were erected to create something resembling bedchambers, but whenever the metal fittings of chests rattled, people would cry "What's that!" and be startled - quite unlike newlyweds during the day. Thus, while normally after nightfall there would be nothing but the wind chimes of soba sellers or the barking of stray dogs in the quiet outskirts of town, now there was commotion, with lanterns brighter than daylight, voices calling for fire prevention, and the clattering of wooden clappers so noisy that the city center was conversely so quiet it seemed devoid of people.

Truly unprecedented, this will surely become material for future stories.

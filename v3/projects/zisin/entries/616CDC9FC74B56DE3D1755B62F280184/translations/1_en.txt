[Omitting duplicate section]
The outcome of this fanning out remains unclear - will it ultimately follow public opinion throughout the realm? This is truly a dangerous situation. Particularly suspicious is that the feudal lords, having no concern from the outset for matters of public and private righteousness, each align themselves according to their desired interests - such rumors are truly most inauspicious. This too may be a sign of declining fortunes. The Lord of Satsuma is also among them, and there are intentions to marry his daughter to the shogunate. Depending on whether this daughter is adopted or natural-born, there would be differences between propriety and impropriety, causing public opinion to be in turmoil.

His Lordship remains aloof and uninvolved, and while his profound considerations are to be revered, I believe this to be quite foolish.

○ At the beginning of this month, I inspected the first and second Takanawa coastal batteries. While impressive from the outside, the interior was even more magnificent, and the construction costs must have been considerable. Truly befitting the dignity of the realm, the general layout features earthwork fortifications twenty ken thick, with correspondingly built barracks, ammunition depots, and other严重 structures. However, the bronze cannons for defense appeared rather crude, and there were also iron cannons sent from various domains, but the overall scale generally follows Western models, though not completely adhering to those principles. Six schooner vessels built at Tsukuda at that time were moored nearby, and when I boarded to inspect them, they were of simple yet sturdy construction and would be extremely convenient for transport vessels and cargo. They are said to be identical to Russian-made vessels, but rumors suggest that their shallow draft makes them unsuitable for mounting heavy cannons. Both the coastal batteries and ships are scheduled for inspection by senior and junior officials.

His Lordship is also expected to visit within the next day or two.

○ Regarding the large vessel built by Mito domain moored at Yokohama, one named "Yakugai-maru," the reputation among government officials seems to be improving somewhat. Recently, senior councillors and others up to about fifty years of age have inspected it after long journeys. Platoon formations and gun drills are also being practiced in various locations.

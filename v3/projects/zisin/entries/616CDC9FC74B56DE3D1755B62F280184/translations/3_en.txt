may his journey be safe. There are rumors to this effect. ○ Recently, I am scheduled to meet with Manjirō from Tosa Province, who drifted to America, in the company of Mitsukuri and others. There may be some interesting accounts from this meeting, but otherwise there is nothing else of significance worth reporting. For now, I respond to your two kind letters while inquiring about your health in this season. Written hastily with all respect. With fear and humble reverence.

This state would continue for tens of millions of years without any change whatsoever.

However, some think that Amaterasu Omikami has already departed from this world, and there is fierce debate about the capital cities where she resided. Some even go so far as to search for the location of her imperial mausoleum. These people should truly be called senseless. Moreover, even those who have studied the way of the gods of our country think that when disasters like earthquakes occur, they are the work of Katsu-hi-no-kami, which shows insufficient understanding. The name Katsu-hi-no-kami, while splendid-sounding, is an erroneous name, and this is not a deity involved in disasters. Therefore, it is Masa-tsu-hi-no-kami who appears next. In the way of the gods of our country, water has Mizuhanome-no-kami as the god of water, fire has Kagutsuchi-no-kami as the god of fire. Earthquakes also have their earthquake deity, and floods, fires, and earthquakes are all manifestations of their respective gods. Therefore, appeasing the hearts of these gods is the essential purpose of our country's way.

Thus, what we respectfully call the earthquake deities are the two gods I now contemplate: Susanoo-no-Mikoto and Onamuji-no-Mikoto. Since earthquakes are manifestations of these gods, people have no choice but to fear and be cautious of their divine power.

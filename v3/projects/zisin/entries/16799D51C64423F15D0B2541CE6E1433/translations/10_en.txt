New Considerations on Earthquakes

This year on the second day of the seventh month, at the hour of the monkey, there was an extremely severe earthquake, and since there are still aftershocks today, I have listened to the theories of contemporary scholars. They all follow the ideas of those Western barbarian countries, which claim that "yin qi lies dormant underground, and while pure qi tries to rise it cannot do so, and while fire qi in the earth tries to expand it cannot be released." If their words were truly correct, then why don't we first see fine particles of earth being ejected from the ground and smoke arising in the fields before an eruption occurs? Why don't we see well water suddenly becoming turbid, hot springs bubbling up, and clouds forming nearby? If this were the rising of earth qi, how could it fail to disperse and rise?

This is the god of wind." In the norito for the Shikada Wind God Festival in volume eight of the Engi-shiki, it says: "We reverently inform the Imperial Grandson's great dream. Moreover, if the crops that the people of the realm cultivate encounter bad winds, earthquakes, or floods and fail to grow properly, then we reverently inform that our sacred names are Tsuchi no Mikoto and Kuni no Mikoto."

Originally, wind is essential for supporting both heaven and earth, but what makes wind into wind depends on the divine virtue of Shinatsuhiko no Mikoto and Shinagatobe no Mikoto. If the divine virtue of these gods

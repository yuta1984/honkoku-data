"Kuni" (country/land) probably refers to underground, while "Takamagahara" (High Heavenly Plain) refers to the empty space above ground, called Takamagahara because people look up to it. However, there are theories that say the sun is Takamagahara and the moon is Ne-no-kuni, but these greatly differ from the ancient understanding of our great country, so one must never be misled by them. After Susanoo-no-Mikoto entered Ne-no-kuni, when Onamuji-no-Kami left Ne-no-kuni, the heavenly marsh koto he carried struck the trees and the earth moved and resounded. Therefore, earthquakes originate with Susanoo-no-Mikoto and are connected to Onamuji-no-Kami, and it is extremely clear that these two deities should be called the earthquake gods.

The book called Kujiki (Records of Ancient Matters) appears to be a work that combines the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, supplementing what was missing and falsely compiled, but it seems quite ancient, and within it, the Chigi Hongi (Records of Earth Deities) was created, making Susanoo-no-Mikoto and Onamuchi-no-Mikoto the overall controllers of earth deities.

This was based on ancient understanding. This is unrelated to our current topic, but I wrote it down because it came to mind when discussing how earthquakes are connected to these two deities.

Even though the tradition is so clear in the divine classics, did people of the past not think of it as earthquake tradition? There were not many who explained it as such either. But if we don't consider "the trembling of mountains, rivers, and land" and "the earth moving and resounding" as referring to what we now call earthquakes, what else would they be? Since the Nihon Shoki already writes earthquakes as "earth movement," it matches what the Kojiki writes as "earth moving and resounding," making it even clearer. Few people in the world know about earthquake deities, and moreover, they no longer fear the work of these gods...

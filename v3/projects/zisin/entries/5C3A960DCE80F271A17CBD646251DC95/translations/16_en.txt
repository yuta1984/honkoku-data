The countless spirits of those who lost their lives wander this land, and their grief and lamentation being higher than mountains and deeper than the sea, it is only natural that they are lost. Therefore, finding it difficult to silently accept such kind condolences, I thought to use the 200 hiki of money I received as seed money to perform Buddhist services and memorial offerings for the repose of the souls - perhaps this might calm the evil winds and rumblings caused by hunger and bring peace. But this too is the shallow thinking of a vulgar commoner, and there may be many other disasters as well. I am troubled by worldly desires, and it is fortunate that I can think of this, following the foolish complaints arising from my heartache.

As the first seven-day memorial period for those who died unnatural deaths was approaching, I relied on a kind-hearted person named Sukeemon Takeri and went to visit the head priest Kyochiku of Fusai Temple in the same village to request a great segaki (feeding of hungry ghosts) ceremony for the evening service and merit-making. He immediately agreed, but due to such disasters, even the priest's robes and Buddhist implements could not be assembled. Nevertheless, preparations must be made to perform the memorial service properly. For such unnatural deaths, performing the ceremony quickly brings especially great merit. Even if there are no offerings to give, this is ultimately what we monks wish for.

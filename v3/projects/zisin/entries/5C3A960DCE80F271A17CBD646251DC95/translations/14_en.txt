With no care for appearances, the fragrance of plum blossoms had completely vanished, and like disheveled hair after washing, even the daily grooming and makeup was not white but defiled with soot and dust from the burned ruins. The distinction between men and women was completely unclear, and with daytime fatigue and anxiety about what further flood disasters might come, they could find no peace. Tying cords to their sandals and clutching their straw footwear, they passed the nights crouched down, and even in their half-sleeping state they listened intently to the sound of water, thinking that the millions who had died unnatural deaths must have surely perished in agony. Wondering what would become of them next, even the temple bells that marked the hours had been destroyed, and the Buddhist principle that "nirvana is bliss" seemed to make the cycle of life and death truly without evil.

What could be heard in the deepening night was not autumn, yet only the sound of night storms blowing through the gaps, the distant howling of dogs that had survived the fires. Looking through the gaps in the enclosures, the lights of the scattered huts flickered naturally with the flames, and people spoke together of loneliness and fear. There were no neighboring houses, no houses behind, and no houses in front either - just one hut here in the middle of the separated rice fields, one hut there, each family having fled as they thought best and established temporary dwellings. They waited longingly for the brightening sky and listened for the crow of roosters announcing the dawn, keeping their sorrows there with them.

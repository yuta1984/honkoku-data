The magistrates (bugyō) also attended court and withdrew at seven o'clock the following morning.

1. The great destruction in this area cannot be easily repaired and will require enormous expenses. In any case, there are rumors that the senior councillors (rōjū) will come to Kyoto, but until the day before yesterday the earthquakes had not stopped. Currently, prayers have been ordered at various locations, and the Tsuchimikado family and the chief priests of Ise and Kasuga have been summoned to the Imperial Palace for daily prayers.

1. The embankment along the Uji River has been completely cracked, and in some places there are areas where the embankment has completely lost its form. If there should be heavy rain or flooding on top of this, it would be another disaster - truly a worrying situation.

The rest is omitted. News from Kyoto.

From a letter from Tsuchimikado to Sadokami-dono, the eldest son of Makino Ise-no-kami-dono:
"Great earthquake at the hour of the monkey on the 2nd day of the 7th month"
Fortunately, there was no major damage to the Imperial Palace buildings, walls, etc.
　Most of the roof tiles on the palace walls fell, causing some damage.
The turrets of Nijō Castle were slightly damaged, and most of the high walls collapsed.
The temple bell of the Great Buddha fell. Large stones in the stone walls loosened and came out in various places.
　However, rumors about the castle and below, and about Buddhist temples, are not reliable. Of course, if Lord Iyo had been residing at the castle, it would have caused great worry, but regarding this year's disaster, I believe we can be at ease.

I write this in a separate letter. On the evening of the 2nd of this month at seven o'clock, there was a great earthquake in the Kyoto, Fushimi, and Ōtsu

area, and tremors have continued day and night until the day before yesterday, the 14th.
Due to the earthquakes, people of all social ranks, high and low, have no peace of mind whatsoever. There are rumors that it will not stop unless there is heavy rain,
and truly both inside and outside the capital of Kyoto
present scenes too terrible to behold.
1. The Imperial Palace is also severely damaged, with all the surrounding earthen walls collapsed. At Nijō Castle,
　the stone walls of the moat have crumbled, and sections of over ten ken have fallen into the moat. Both guard stations'
　huts have completely collapsed, and even the guard captains are sleeping outdoors. Moreover, over seventy
　guard huts have been destroyed by the earthquake. Among these, the damage to Nijō Castle alone, both inside and outside,
　is no trivial matter. The main gate has also collapsed from the tremors, the stone walls have crumbled making passage difficult
　to such a degree. At the approach to the main gate, the ground has cracked over ten shaku, with a width of over one shaku, spewing forth mud.

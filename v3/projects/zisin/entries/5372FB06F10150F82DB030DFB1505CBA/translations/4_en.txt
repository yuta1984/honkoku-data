We are greatly rejoicing. Please be assured on this point. In the outside world, storehouses and such have
collapsed in great numbers, and walls that have fallen are countless—one can see straight through
from the four corners to the center. Other than that, partial damage is generally the case for entire rows of houses. In the outlying areas,
houses and such have also collapsed in great numbers. In all of Kyoto, there is not
a single place that sustained no damage at all. Those who died instantly from sheer shock,
those who died crushed under houses and storehouses, and others who died instantly
crushed under torii gates, stone lanterns, stone monuments
and such—there are many of them, and the injured are so
numerous as to be indescribable. Pregnant women who gave birth on the spot due to the shock,
and sick people dying from exposure to the sun—these too are countless. Moreover,
since it was the lunch hour and people were in the bath, truly countless men and women rushed

naked to their gates, and others came out to their gates
still holding rice bowls and chopsticks—given the time of day, there were truly all sorts of situations. Afterward,
small tremors occurred from time to time, and that same night at the fourth hour, there was a truly strong tremor
that caused nothing but alarm and heartache. However, it was not like the second one. Even now,
small tremors continue to occur about every half hour. In the historical records, exactly
this sort of thing is recorded as having happened eighty years ago. At our shop too, on the night of the second, not
a single person slept, and finally around half past the eighth hour of night, only the children went to bed.
All the adults and elderly had pale faces and spent the night
awake. From the morning of the third day, people have been laying out tatami mats in the middle of the street for coming and going—
about eight or nine parts of ten do this. Day and night alike, this is the situation, truly like that of outcasts.

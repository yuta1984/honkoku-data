Brief Theory of Earthquakes, compiled by Ryōshū Sanjin

According to Western scientific theory, the source of earth tremors lies in fire pits underground, which exist in great numbers throughout the globe. In our country, there are two such sources: one in the central provinces (Suruga, Tōtōmi, Kai, Shinano, Izu, Sagami), and one in the land of Ezo. Their fire veins extend far, reaching even to foreign countries. The form of these fire pits is like buried embers, naturally vaporizing earth energy upward, causing all things to grow and develop. Therefore, when an earthquake first begins to occur, smoke and vapor rise to the earth's surface, covering the sky for a time and causing the stars to lose their brilliance—this serves as a sign. Places where one can witness this directly and constantly observe such phenomena include the mountains of Shinshū, Hizen, Satsuma, Hyūga, Izu, and many others. Areas where fire veins do not flow are numerous in the eastern

southern regions of Russia and the northern regions of America. These lands are desolate, where not even grass and trees can grow. Regions where fire energy flows are especially fertile, and all things flourish abundantly. This is indeed the marvelous ingenuity of the Creator! However, that which provides such vast benefits also produces extremely great harm. Earthquakes and tsunamis are examples of this. The aforementioned fire pits, compressed by the entire earth and normally extremely quiet, will cause flame energy to activate and shake the great earth when even a small amount of air penetrates them. In severe cases, they shake and collapse even mountains, spew forth sand and stones, destroy people's homes, cause many to suffer harm, and even cause mountains, rivers, and valleys to change their locations. In distant lands, an entire city in Italy was buried underground, and all people, vegetation, and livestock perished completely. Recently, earthquakes and tsunamis in our country's Echigo, Shinano, Kinai, Kii, Iga, Izu, Suruga and other regions

○A retainer of the lord of Kasama had a child of about ten years old who got his left arm trapped under a thick pillar. He said to the people nearby, "Please take the short sword from my waist."

○In Yoshiwara Kadomachi, there was a blind but wealthy man named Hama no Ichi who made his living by keeping singing girls. As soon as the earthquake began to shake, his wife fled outside the gate. Among those singing girls was a sixteen-year-old named Yasu, who took Hama no Ichi by the hand and first led him outside, then remained behind herself to retrieve the ancestral tablets, promissory notes for money lent out, and gold stored in the closet. As she was about to leave, fire broke out and approached. However, being concerned about the whereabouts of her master's wife, she looked along the roadside and found a corpse under the earth where the neighboring storehouse had collapsed. She tried to pull it out, but fire came from behind and her sleeves were about to be singed, so crying bitterly, she departed, found her master, and gave him everything she had rescued without keeping anything.

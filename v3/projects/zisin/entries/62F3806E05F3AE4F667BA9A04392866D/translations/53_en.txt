Brief Record of Earthquake Disasters in Edo, Volume 5

○Around the spring of Ansei 3 (1856), there was a three-volume published work titled "Ansei Kenbun-shi" (Chronicle of Ansei Observations), which combined accounts of last year's earthquake with color-printed illustrations. It was compiled by a disciple of the late Keisai Eisen named Eiju, and the illustrations were drawn by Eiju, Yoshitsuna, Kunichika, Teishu, and others. The veracity of the stories contained within is unknown, but I excerpt them here.

△Someone measured the magnitude of the many aftershocks following the great earthquake and represented them with circles. The display method follows popular convention, using sunrise and sunset to denote day and night. That is, white circles represent daytime and black circles represent nighttime. The circle for the initial earthquake should be drawn particularly large, but due to space constraints on the page, it is omitted here.

○A paper wholesaler named so-and-so from Temma-cho went to a pleasure quarter called Okamotoya, took a "asobi shinzo" (a young courtesan) of about fifteen years old, and entered the bedroom. As it was cold, they put on light garments and relaxed together in bed, when suddenly an earthquake began and the second floor collapsed entirely. The woman clung to him and would not let go, so he took her with him and barely managed to get out through the main gate, fleeing to the embankment. After making various excuses, they parted, and he returned barefoot to his master's house. When he looked around, the commotion was extraordinary. He sat in his usual place called the accounting desk and went about his business, but when people saw this and secretly laughed, he became angry and scolded them harshly.

Feeling utterly ashamed, he fled to the storage room and pretended to be drunk, lying down.

○A retainer of a certain lord in Hama-cho had died the previous year, leaving behind a wife and two daughters. They received a small stipend of rice, and there was a private understanding that they should find a husband for the elder daughter to continue the family line.

In this earthquake, the house collapsed and the mute daughter was trapped under the fallen wall earth.

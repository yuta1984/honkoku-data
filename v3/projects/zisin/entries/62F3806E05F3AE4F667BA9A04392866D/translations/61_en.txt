Frost crept in, and everyone clung like branches of bush clover. Even when brightly lit, lying on a bed like a crouching wild boar through the night, we could not sleep. Even the winter rain leaked through, and like a bird with molted feathers in the cold night wind, it became even more severe, and we waited for dawn and wept.

Tanka poems:
Does the earthquake still shake and stabilize the islands of Japan, keeping them unmoved for tens of thousands of generations?
The collapsed houses burned, and even what barely remained was stolen
Even in the hut, earthquakes occur, but if we look away, the winter rain falls and leaks miserably  
Not only houses but hearts are also crushed, leaving no words like the trefoil and four-leaf clover of young grass
The night watchman of the beach where white waves passed cries "Fire! Danger!" across the burnt fields

Verses after the earthquake:
Three hundred years of peaceful extravagance, one earthquake collapsed ten million houses
The changing energy of heaven, earth, and humanity brings a sense of decline - what comes after life's gains and losses?

This is a playful composition by Kitamura of Ukyōkyo. He composed about the weeds in his friend Ishizuka Hōgaishi's storehouse.

O pheasant of the aralia in Musashi Plain, you cry as the earthquake strikes, but do you not know where your wife and children have gone?
Tōikyo-an

The upheaval under heaven - did the gods shake and solidify the nation's sins anew?
Bunō

In the areas that were affected by those disasters, even newly built houses collapsed, and those damaged in last winter's earthquake were completely destroyed, needless to say. Houses that were smashed to pieces were found throughout each neighborhood in numbers too great to count. In last year's earthquake, most of the samurai residences in the upland areas were generally safe, but this time the entire circle of Edo was severely damaged. Certainly, not a single thatch roof remained unscattered by the wind, tile roofs bent under their weight and ridge tiles were damaged. Many had their ceiling boards fall and scatter. Board fences that remained intact were rare. The cliffs of the upland areas along the coast were particularly severely damaged.

In many places, tall trees broke at their roots and fell over. Many grasses withered after being beaten by a single night of rain, and many climbing plants were also damaged.

It is said that property and household goods were washed away before one's very eyes. A small bridge at Honminato-cho waterfront fell down.

In the continuation of Jukken-cho, Lord Matsudaira Awaji-no-kami, whose reconstruction had just been completed after last winter's earthquake disaster and who had just moved in, saw everything collapse completely. Behind the gate site and throughout the area, Tsukiji, Reigan-jima, and other waterfront areas

The shaking is intense at first, then gradually becomes gentler. At this time, the angry waves of the sea tide surge up greatly and rise upstream - this is what is called a tsunami. This occurs because the swollen areas of land collapse and sink, so the open ocean remains calm with waves only at the seashore. When the earth continues to shake slightly for months after an earthquake, it is because the subterranean fire has not yet completely emerged. In severe cases, mountains may erupt. In ancient times, there was a great earthquake in Jōgan 5 (863), and Mount Fuji erupted the following year. Recently, the same occurred in Hōei 4 (1707).

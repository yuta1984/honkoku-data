Abundant Thunder of the Fruitful Autumn, Hakujin One Poem - Upper

【Upper Section】
Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado
The thunder that roars
for the harvested rice
of autumn fields -
even my own heart
cannot help but fear it

Kakinomoto no Hitomaro
Both feet and
hands make noise
at the sound -
ignoble though it is,
through the long night
let the light
cease

Sarumaru Dayū
The lady of the house
calls and gathers
the autumn leaves
of May month,
making no sound -
how sad it is

Abe no Nakamaro
The legs of rain
begin to fall,
and looking up with a rumbling sound,
thunder emerges
from the red trees
of the visible peak

Ono no Komachi
My face has turned
pale blue -
pitying myself,
comparing it
to my own body,
as I gaze

Sangi Takamura
Racing wildly
across the plains of clouds,
falling here and there,
telling people too
of the aftermath's
repair

Emperor Yōzei
Crouching down,
saying "this will fall,"
everyone's faces
filled with fear
have become
like trembling

【Lower Section】
Emperor Go-Toba
Naked,
as thunder
approaches roaring,
bewildered,
holding children
and hiding heads in mountains

Yamabe no Akahito
Looking out
at the furrows in the fields,
because of thunder
even the high price of rice
is now falling

Middle Counselor
Yakamochi
Holding an umbrella,
in the manner of straw sandals,
sheltering from rain,
waiting for light,
the night grows late

Kisen Hōshi
My house and
all that
area -
people say
it seems like it will fall

Semimaru
This roof's boards
and my body too -
whether one knows
the fear of thunder
or not,
it's a matter of heavy rain

High Priest
Henjō
The heavenly gods
have stumbled
on the cloud pathways,
and even men's
forms briefly
shrink

Minister of the Left
of Kawara
On the road
people's coming
and going grow sparse,
and the light grows
strong
with rumbling
in the night

Abundant Thunder of the Fruitful Autumn, Hakujin One Poem - Lower

【Upper Section】
Emperor Kōkō
The lord feeling unwell
gets out of bed
and hangs mosquito nets -
my children's
crying has
also ceased

Ariwara no Narihira
Though the sun falls fast,
not knowing it to be poppy,
with thunder's
rumbling roar
water hides

Ise
Shortening everything,
hanging nets and mosquito nets
all around,
frantically helping
this child through -
how so!

Sosei Hōshi
Not only did it say
"rumble rumble,"
but through the long night
the dawn clothes
and fallen
thunder

Ōe no Chisato
When it falls,
the nearby bed
resonates -
though I do not
listen to it
alone

Sanjō no Udaijin
It starts roaring
and the heavy rain
won't stop,
so being rained upon,
coming in the night with hand baskets

Minamoto no Muneyuki
Ason
On the mountain side it falls
so lonely,
and roaring again,
thinking that the light
falls strongly

【Lower Section】
Middle Counselor
Yukihira
Quickly standing,
hiding myself
in a country house,
when I hear
it has stopped,
I will return now

Fujiwara no Toshiyuki
Ason
Refreshingly cool,
the light also
strongly roaring
thunder -
with a dreamlike feeling
calling people

Prince Motoyoshi
Though it stopped,
thinking that now
the thunder
might roar again,
everyone is thoroughly
stunned

Bun'ya no Yasuhide
Because it roars,
leaving traces, a heavy drinker
reluctantly
bathed in
unreasonable
sake, so they say

Sugawara no Michizane
This thunder
roars until
morning comes
without stopping,
and flashing light
mingles constantly
with the bed

Middle Counselor Kanesuke
In gentle ears
the resounding thunder -
how long will it
continue roaring
endlessly?

Emperor Juntoku
Stories that remain
from ancient times
of a hundred years -
still gazing
at the clouded
sky

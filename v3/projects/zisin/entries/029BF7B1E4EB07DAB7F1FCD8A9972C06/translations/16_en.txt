During the night of the spring fire brigade's New Year ceremony (dezome), when the "ma" and "ra" groups take the lead and set out with their "crotch crests," there will be quite a commotion from behind. With great vigor, they thrust their sasumata (forked spears) forward, lifting their hips. Continuing with first, second, and third teams, working breathlessly together, those carrying ladders gather in the night to briefly rest from their fatigue.

In this spring wind, the world turns bad colors - the fire-prevention water barrels turn black, the nameplates throughout Edo's neighborhoods turn white, wealthy landlords turn blue from miscellaneous expenses, and house owners turn red sitting by the hearth warmed by sake. Tenant shopkeepers rattle their wooden clappers, drag their bamboo night-watch tools with a clatter, rub their sleepy eyes, and call out in shrill voices as they make their rounds, proclaiming "Let us be careful of fire!"

The Greed Rooster
Head: gold coins; Eyes: hundred-mon coins
Belly: two-shu gold; Feathers: one-bu gold
　　Tail: striped purse
♪This here rooster was captured alive from Sato Mountain - a greedy rooster of this world! As you can see, it's all unreasonable, formed from everyone's precious desires and wants. It lays an egg, and when it hatches, it grows into such a rooster, also called "Yokudori" (Greed Bird). It eats nothing but money for food. Now, everyone, please look carefully! What a frightening creature this is, so unreasonable! The first master artist drew this, transforming his painting of a greedy hawk into this rooster - this too is the artist's greed, so unreasonable! Ah, I want money, I want gold!

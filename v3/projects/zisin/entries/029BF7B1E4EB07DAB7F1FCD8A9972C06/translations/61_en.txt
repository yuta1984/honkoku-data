Great Earthquake in Sagami Province

This occurred in the 6th year of Kaei, the year of the Ox (1853), on the 2nd day of the 2nd month, around the ninth hour of the day (around noon). The earthquake affected the castle town of Odawara in Sagami Province and extended eastward to include the area around Tamura River, Atsugi, Ogino-sanchu, Koza District's Godo, Ido, Oiso post station, Nakamura, Kaneko, Suzukawa, Minoge, Kasuya, Isehara, Koyasu area, the area around Mount Oyama, the mountains near Osumi District, Kamimura, Yatamura, Okamoto, Hayakawa, Ishibashiyama, Futagoyama, Hakone and all seven hot spring areas, Yumoto, Hatajuku, Yamanaka, and Mitsutani area. To the west, it reached Atami area in Izu Province, Mishima post station, Umasiri Pass, Iwatari Pass, Toba Pass, and as far as the Numazu area in Suruga Province, and even Hara post station and Yoshiwara post station areas suffered considerable damage.

To the north, in Aiko District's Mimasu-gawamura, the mountains in this area were greatly devastated, and in Tsukui District's Aonohara and the lower Toshi River area, Nezumizaka and Hashimoto areas suffered some damage. The Kohara area and Seki area also suffered similar damage. The tremors continued until past the ninth hour of the night, with countless shakings, but there were five major tremors, and finally the shaking stopped, bringing relief to the people.

Therefore, to inform relatives and connections in various provinces of this event, I record it in detail on this paper.

The Story of the Great Earthquake

Long ago, the capital of Heian in Yamashiro Province was a place established by Emperor Kanmu, chosen as a location harmonious with the Four Guardian Deities and meant to be an eternal capital for all ages. However, on the 2nd and 3rd days of the 7th month of Bunsei 13 (1830), the year of the Tiger, during both days and nights, a great earthquake occurred. Mountains collapsed, and the Kamo River, Oi River, and Katsura River overflowed, reaching into the capital. The affected mountains included Higashiyama, Nishiyama, Atago, Kurama, the foothills, Saga, Omuro, and Mount Takao. In the capital, private houses collapsed and many people were injured. The wounded numbered 20,000 to 30,000 people, and the dead exceeded 2,000. Among the temple halls and pagodas, starting with both monzeki temples, Gion, Kiyomizu, Chion-in, Yasaka Pagoda, the pagoda of Toji, and the great pagodas of major temples all collapsed completely. The residences of warrior families and the palaces of court nobles were all shaken down. The imperial monzeki retreated in all directions, but everyone who tried to walk on the great earth fell down, unable to take even a single step. Water overflowed from the mountains in all directions, people became lost trying to escape, and many died. Even cattle, horses, chickens, and dogs were lost in great numbers. It was truly a sight too terrible to behold.

During the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th days, there were about 5 or 6 earthquakes, some particularly strong. During these times, people carried tatami mats and wooden doors out onto the roads, and upon these, men and women, young and old alike, prayed to the gods and buddhas. At the seventh hour of dawn on the 4th day (around 4 AM), it finally calmed down, and then heavy rain began to fall incessantly. Particularly in Fushimi and other areas, the tremors were severe on the 3rd day, causing fear among people young and old, but because this was entirely the land of the imperial capital, it settled down without major injury.

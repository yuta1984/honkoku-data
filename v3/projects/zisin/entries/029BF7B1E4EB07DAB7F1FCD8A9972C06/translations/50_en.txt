Tenpō 5, Year of the Horse
February 7th - Locations of Relief Shelters
Regarding the Great Fire
From the Shogunate - For the tens of thousands of people
relief shelters have been erected, so they need not wander the streets
and can shelter from rain and dew, and furthermore each person
has been given money, which is truly
noble and grateful
Such benevolent governance is so overwhelming to speak of
that while it may seem presumptuous, all the people rejoiced
and sang "Banzai!"

Notice Regarding Wind-Cold (Influenza) Remedy
Regarding our matter of spreading wind-cold illnesses, we sent many straw dolls and such from the Kamigata (Kansai) region, unavoidably causing numerous outbreaks throughout Edo, inflicting upon everyone not only runny noses and colds but also headaches, body aches, abdominal pain (senki), and parasitic diseases, causing great trouble even to bathhouses and barber shops.

The treatment method consisted entirely of cold medicine - after drinking egg wine, high fever developed, causing loss of consciousness, and now there are no excuses to be made. Just when we were about to make prayers to the Hoin (Buddhist priest) and perform ritual prayers, the pharmacy provided proper medicine preparation that immediately induced sweating, causing terrible chills for which we are deeply sorry.

From now on, we will be absolutely careful, and should violent sneezing occur, we will cover ourselves with large night robes to induce sweating and drive it away with kudzu root decoction (kakkonto). Should such recurring colds occur, we will rely on the immediate effectiveness of massage, drink one cup completely, rest, and achieve immediate full recovery without relapse. Due to the cold, thus like sneezing.

Wind God Banishment Otsu-e Ballad
Evil Spirit Exorcism
Hateful Wind God,
You cannot enter this house.
The Wind God is astounded.
Yes, yes, I cannot match Shoki-sama (demon-quelling deity).
Holding a wind bag and a persimmon-tannin fan,
Fleeing in fear, I shall go to other houses.
Oh, that hateful demon,
Drawing his sword. Without any difficulty.
Thinking it was one strike, I awoke.
The cold was also completely cured.

By Kobayashi Kyora

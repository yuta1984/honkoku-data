use Uemon as an intermediary for a position in Lord Aoyama's household or somewhere suitable in the eastern provinces," he persistently
requested. So with "very well then," [the acquaintance] sent him to Uemon with a letter of introduction. Uemon heard the circumstances,
and [said], "Since samurai help each other, there may be various connections and timing involved, but first rest at my son Sannosuke's place, without
reserve toward anyone," and cared for him as if he were family. Gengoemon settled in and
met with the young men of the household, became a spear instructor, and was celebrated here and there. At one point Uemon
secretly summoned Gengoemon and said, "I too have devoted myself to martial arts in various ways since my youth,
and by divine favor have given spear instruction to our lord, and everyone in the household has been my student, but
your spearwork, which I have been observing from the shadows recently, appears quite inexperienced. If a skilled
person were to notice this it would be embarrassing, so please stop," but though [Gengoemon] agreed in words, he did not
stop at all. So another time [Uemon] gave advice, explaining "A samurai's single-minded pursuit has no obstacles. Martial arts are without limit, so
rather people's praise and criticism..." and so forth. Then [Gengoemon said] "Then I would like to meet with your

instruction," and brought out a practice spear and requested [a match]. [Uemon replied] "No, that is unnecessary. It would be unseemly
for either to lose," and declined, but due to [Gengoemon's] insistent request they had one match, and with a "Ya!" cry
[Gengoemon] thrust hard at [Uemon's] chest. When [Uemon] said "One more match," [Gengoemon] completely refused, but when [Uemon's] expression changed and he
requested it, it was hard to refuse, so they matched again, and [Uemon] immediately knocked down [Gengoemon's] long spear. Gengoemon
thought this unbearably mortifying and watched for an opportunity to settle this grudge. Soon, around the hour of the dog at night,
just as Uemon was returning from the castle, with rain gear prepared for the spring rain, walking along without a care,
Gengoemon leaped out from behind some small bushes and said "Do you remember the spear grudge?" and thrust through [Uemon's] torso with a short spear.
Uemon drew his sword but his wooden clogs broke and he fell down. The servant, thinking this a terrible
thing, ran straight back to the house and reported "such and such has happened." Sannosuke and all the retainers
rushed out and barely managed to help him return home, but it was a serious wound so he could not endure it. His second son Hanzō was
five years old, his third son Genzō was two years old, both very young, so [he said] the mother should take good care of them. His eldest son Sannosuke

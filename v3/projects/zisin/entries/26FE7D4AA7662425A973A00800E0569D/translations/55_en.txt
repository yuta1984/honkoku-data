Due to his mental illness, his domain was confiscated, and his son Matashirō-dono was granted 5,000 koku, while his second son Mikawa-no-jō was granted 1,000 koku.

The circumstances of this mental illness were as follows: A retainer of Lord Sado-no-kami named Suzaku Heisuke had committed some impropriety and was placed under house confinement. At this time, as it corresponded to the centennial memorial of Lord Sado-no-kami's grandfather Lord Inaba-no-kami, a chief retainer named Fujita Hachirōemon petitioned for Heisuke's pardon. Lord Sado-no-kami became extremely angry and, considering him an accomplice of the improper Heisuke, ordered the following men to commit seppuku:

<<Chief retainer>> Fujita Hachirōemon and Shōjirō <<Administrator>> <<Ōoka Kuzaemon, Suzaku Heisuke, Tōjirō, Sangoro>>

The relatives were unaware that such orders had been given, and when they heard about it and came to visit, the situation appeared to show signs of mental illness, which was reported. Until the moment these men were ordered to commit seppuku, even the retainers had never noticed any signs of mental illness.

○Same September: Transfer from Hamamatsu in Tōtōmi to Kameyama in Tamba - Lord Aoki Shimotsuke-no-kami

○Same year, night of December 15th: Forty-six retainers of the late Lord Asano Takumi-no-kami <<However, of forty-seven men, one was a foot soldier who requested to withdraw from the scene>>

Led by chief retainer Ōishi Kuranosuke, they infiltrated the Honjo mansion of Lord Kira Kōzuke-no-suke, attacked through both gates, burst into his sleeping quarters, killed Kōzuke-no-suke in revenge for their master, withdrew together, and gathered at Sengakuji Temple in Shiba, the family temple of Lord Takumi-no-kami. They submitted a written statement explaining their intentions to the metsuke Lord Sengoku Hōki-no-kami.

However, it is said that Kōzuke-no-suke's head was taken by a man named Ma Jūjirō.

Among Lord Kira Sahyōe's retainers, sixteen died, of whom eleven showed blood on their sword cuts.

The above forty-six men were placed in the custody of daimyo: Seventeen with Lord Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami; Ten each with Lord Mōri Kai-no-kami, Lord Matsudaira Oki-no-kami, and Lord Mizuno Kenmotsu. Under this custody arrangement, they were ordered to commit seppuku in February of the following year of the Sheep.

Of the forty-seven men who went to the senior metsuke, two men <<District administrators: Yoshida Chūzaemon, age 63; Tomimori Sukeemon, age 32>>

These men reportedly brought and submitted written documents.

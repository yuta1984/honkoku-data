Ōshuku Zakki Volume 80 Draft

Genealogy of the Yūki and Shirakawa Clans (This document has long been transmitted by a farmer from Ishimura village. As it could serve as evidence, I made a copy of it. It was shown to me from Lord Tsunetari's collection.)

1. The Yūki clan split into two branches, and [one branch] built Komine Castle in Shirakawa as their residence. According to the Taiheiki, the monk Yūki Dōchū was killed in battle at Anōtsu in Ise Province. A traveling monk clearly witnessed Chūō (the faithful old man) suffering the torments of hell on the Tōkaidō road, so he went down to Shirakawa and reported this to Chūō's son. Therefore, the son established a temple of the Yugyō sect for the repose of his father's soul. This was called Komine-ji Temple. Years passed, and when Taikō Hideyoshi ruled the realm, he personally conducted an inspection tour of the Kantō and Ōshū regions. From this time, Masamune of Sendai came to pay his respects in Osaka. When Yoshichika stopped at Shirakawa, he sent retainers bearing horses and hawks as gifts to the presence [of Hideyoshi], relying on Masamune to present them. When Masamune seized Aizu, the Taikō became greatly enraged and [Masamune] barely managed to withdraw.

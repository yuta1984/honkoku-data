The flowers covering the entire surface are like a go board on Mount Ueno - white clouds hanging before the Black Gate

Mountain cherry blossoms with no gap for wind to enter - are they cherry blossoms or mountains, mountains or cherry blossoms?

Even the sake cup, befitting the Girls' Festival - hands are thrust in around the peach blossoms

Seeking to receive the speechless yellow rose's meal - even the parent's precious child at Ide's Tamagawa

From above and below, again flowers with flowers - are they facing mirrors or wisteria waves on the pond?

Summer

Iris - in the past, the Tale of Ise; now the auspicious opening of the Mikawa Chronicle

In the close relationship between spring and summer, all the more so - do the blooming deutzia say to make hedges?

This god's division, thunder, how grateful - even with hollyhock it's still not enough

After the cuckoo's cry, the bewildered face of Go-Tokudaiji in the dawn

No matter how much I endure, the cuckoo must cry in the sky of passing showers

The first bonito that came from Kamakura's sea - all of it goes into the plains of Musashino

At the darkness between the rice-planting maiden's thighs, even hermits need not worry about losing their sophistication

In this upright world of climbing bamboo, one knows it by the mugwort among the hemp above and below

The bottom of the sky that receives the early summer rains has fallen out - if water doesn't collect, even the roof leaks

Though I gather fireflies at the window like everyone else - what can I do about the fire burning from their tails?

Koremitsu eating buckwheat flowers while standing - the evening glory flowers grow ever blacker

With the Empress Nadeshiko's name particularly apt - the flowers taken in turn for the summer alcove

If this were a world without falsehood - no holes would open in the skin of genuine watermelons

The red cloth hung for airing in the pawn shop - autumn leaves that cannot even meet the current

The ice house keeper who has been tense since last year - tonight let his heart sleep in complete relaxation

If only the heart were as round as the grass ring - the gods would protect even without passing through

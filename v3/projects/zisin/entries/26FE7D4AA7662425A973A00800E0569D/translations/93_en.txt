They are called either tewaki (hand assistants) or sukete (assistants). The next rank is called rikishi (wrestlers). Together, these are now called the three ranks (san-yaku). According to the abbreviated history, "For the ceremonial forms and decisions of matches, if one does not obtain the right person,議定 cannot be established." Also, "selecting those of ability and obtaining a person of integrity from Shiga in Ōmi Province, he was elevated and appointed as one of the saite-yaku. So that there would be no favoritism in the regulations and etiquette of sumo, as well as in match judgments, all wrestlers received detailed instructions and conducted themselves properly."

That person was selected and entrusted with this responsibility. Therefore, when selecting from among sumo practitioners, everyone would recommend that there was no one other than Seirin. The saite official was the sumo magistrate, which was the beginning of the later gyōji (referees). The seasonal court ceremonies were then first conducted. From this time, Shiga Seirin was appointed as sumo magistrate, and the forms of sumo and principles of matches all followed Seirin's customs, becoming uniformly correct. In the etiquette of court seasonal ceremonies, there was no distinction of east and west, but rather left and right were called out. The left side was the moto-gata (original side), the right side was the yori-gata (visiting side). However, the saite was limited to one person.

The law of heaven's longevity and earth's permanence, the tradition of the yokozuna, and the dohyō-iri (ring entrance ceremony) of one person - in ancient times this was called kata-ya-iri, where one would enter the earthen ring and clap hands twice. This represents the harmony of heaven and earth, yin and yang. Stomping the feet three times represents the three powers of heaven, earth, and humanity, and the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage. Combined, the five represent wood, fire, earth, metal, and water - the five constants of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faithfulness. First donning the yokozuna rope and performing the foot-stomping ceremony: Tōn (Greedy Wolf Star), Kyo (Giant Gate Star), Roku (Salary Preservation Star), Mon (Literary Music Star), Ren (Honest Chastity Star), Bu (Military Music Star), Ha (Army Breaking Star) - these are the names of the seven stars - seven stompings to gather ki in the lower abdomen. Then one becomes immovable. Therefore, sharpening one's ki like a sharp sword, one conducts matches. Entering and exiting with an upright and straight form represents inner and outer purity, purification of the six senses, peace under heaven, tranquility of the land, and successful harvests - this is the primary transmission.

The saite-yaku assumes this position after age thirty. The reason is that in youth, muscles and bones are unstable and ki moves about. The abbreviated history also states "marriage is not permitted from age twenty-five to thirty." Among the hundreds of arts, when one unifies the mind, even if the form appears sharp, the interior remains calm. Therefore, in sumo, gentleness alone is considered good. Because of being firm, one does not move; being gentle and round, one is careful not to become angry even momentarily. This is selflessness (muga). Even having strength, one does not display it outwardly; even when seeing the opponent's weakness, one does not take risks, but simply cultivates the interior - this is called the saite official. Therefore, one appears before high-ranking nobles and conducts naked matches. Also, when there is any thought within, it reflects as if in a mirror; when practicing daily without other thoughts, marvelous techniques naturally emerge.

Thus she composed and threw herself into this abyss. When Jikyū came searching and heard of this matter, he continued with these thoughts:

"Casting away one's life at a perilous place on a steep cliff, more than ten years pass in an instant. Her flower-like beautiful face was shattered against the rocks, her lovely eyebrows met with dust and sand.

"In the sovereign's reign, with the moon shining on the bay plovers, hiding in the sand of unknown waves"

Kōnan's reply:
"In the sovereign's reign, now with the moon shining on the rocky shore plovers, relying on the clear moon's light"

The above was seen at the end of a letter from Getsudō when Master Kitamura Suefumi of the Imperial Poetry Bureau (grandson of Kitamura Kigin) was appointed to preside over gatherings, so rather than letting it become waste paper...

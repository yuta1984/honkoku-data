eighteen years old, so he has gained strength in his arms, go ahead and take revenge for your father and offer [the enemy's head] before his tomb," which
became his final words, and that night he finally passed away. Sannosuke reported the above circumstances to his lord,
received a license [for revenge], took along one contracted retainer, and departed for parts unknown.
Until the spring when he was twenty-two, he searched through provinces east, west, north and south, crossing mountains and seas, but could not find [his target].
Thinking this was too much, since Gengoemon's stepfather, a doctor named Akahori Yūsai, was in Ōtsu,
he killed this man and posted a public notice: "The one who killed the innocent Yūsai is Ishii Sannosuke.
If you wish to take revenge for your parent, come to the house of so-and-so in such-and-such village in Mino Province. [This message is] for Akahori Gen-
goemon." Now when summer came, Sannosuke was taking a cold bath in the spacious
garden of the so-and-so family in Mino Province, when Gengoemon rushed out from within a bamboo grove that stretched four or five chō and said "Do you remember your
parent's enemy?" and slashed at his shoulder. Since Sannosuke had been waiting for this day after day, he said "I understand!" and
drew and struck with the wakizashi that his page was carrying, and he managed to slice across what seemed to be Gengoemon's back.

Since Sannosuke had a serious wound, he could not endure it and died immediately. His accompanying
retainer thought this terribly regrettable, but since he had lost sight of Gengoemon's whereabouts,
he had no choice but to return to his home province and explain the circumstances to the second and third sons. Both
finally came of age and traveled around various provinces, and when Genzō was twenty-three years old, he heard a small lead about the matter.
So he changed his name to Moridaira and went to serve as a sandal-bearer for Shimomura
Magozaemon, a banner commander with a 250-koku stipend in the household of Itakura Suō-no-kami, lord of Kameyama Castle, devoting himself and working tirelessly.
His master also showed him special pity. Among all those in the household who came to know him,
there was one Akahori Mizuemon with a 150-koku stipend, and Moridaira had one of his retainers
serve as a page in [Mizuemon's household], so he had especially close relations [with that house]. This was in the summer of Genroku 13 [1700].
Magozaemon sent Moridaira to Mizuemon's place on business, and Mizuemon was taking a cold bath.
Since Moridaira was someone he usually showed compassion to, he called him over and had him wash his back, but

Kicking into the opponent's inner thigh with intention, turning toward the lower grip side and dropping them - this is called jōte yagura (upper grip tower). Lifting from the lower grip while turning and sweeping the opponent's knee with one's upper hand - this is called shitate yagura (lower grip tower). Taking the mawashi with the upper grip, lowering one's hips slightly, and throwing by hooking the hip so forcefully that one's head sweeps the ground - this is called jōte-nage (upper grip throw). The shitate-nage (lower grip throw) involves not releasing the opponent's upper arm while hooking the hip to throw. Taking the upper grip, turning the head toward the upper grip side, extracting the foot and pulling them down is called dashi-nage (pulling throw).

Also, taking the mawashi and swinging around like a yagura is called yatsuka-nage (eight-handle throw). Also, putting one's head under the opponent's armpit, shouldering the opponent's arm, taking the side mawashi with the lower hand and falling backward is called ude-gaeshi (arm reversal). Sitting and returning toward the opponent is called shugi-gaeshi (mallet reversal). Using both hands and hooking with the foot is called kake-gaeshi (hooking reversal). Also, when the opponent's leg from the knee down hits one's shoulder and one falls backward, this is called issun-gaeshi (one-inch reversal). Tsuma-dori (heel grab) has ancient transmission but is not used now. Kake (hooking techniques) are well known to everyone, so I do not record them. Hineri (twisting) is the name of techniques done with the hands. Having similar advantages and disadvantages, I record only the essentials. The forms of techniques are difficult to write exhaustively, and as recorded before, they are all products of ki-hen (energy transformation).

These are the workings of nothing other than the mind's single technique. Therefore they cannot be seen with the eyes, explained with the mouth, or taught to others. Through the suffering and hardship of training practice, one comes to know these subtle arts by oneself.

The fifteen articles recorded in the catalog - through the subtle arts of training practice since my early years, I gradually became unwavering in this art at age forty-eight, and at fifty-one came to understand the meaning well. However, being of sparrow quality and limited talent, it is difficult for all people to understand. Nevertheless, regarding what I have seen, heard, and known, I record not a single word that is not from the heart. Now leaving this path, I briefly express my humble thoughts and present them to my close friends. I particularly limit this to one thousand copies and cease publication.

The gentleman makes his art his profession, therefore he polishes his inner heart. When polished, it is said to be like a bright mirror on a stand. Having entered the way of sumo for many years, I know where this art resides in the belly. In my prime, emptiness reached emptiness, and gradually reaching the age of knowing heaven's mandate, emptiness returns to the belly. Though not through my scholarly talent, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Shinto all would shift like reflections when the mind's bright mirror is clouded. In sumo too, in the a-un emptiness where victory and defeat are decided, all is mind.

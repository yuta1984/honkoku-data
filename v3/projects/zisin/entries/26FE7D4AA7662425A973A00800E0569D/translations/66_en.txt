During the lifetime of the venerable Nichikō, he was appointed as the successor abbot of Myōshō-ji temple at Ōtaki in this province. The incumbent abbot at that time, being elderly, was relieved of his position as successor, as was reported. The venerable Nichihitsu of Kōkoku-ji temple in Ushigome, Edo, was my dharma brother, and said that if I refused, all members of our dharma lineage would be excommunicated without exception, so I immediately went there. However, there had been ongoing troubles at the head temple Kominato from before. Given this situation, they would send this monk back to Ōshū, saying it would be quite difficult for him to come to this lineage. Recently he became the abbot of Honshaku-ji temple in Namegawa, so Bōtsu also became accordingly settled.

For fourteen years, I moved to Ōno and established a hermitage at the sūtra-reading hall on the estate of village headmen Tōhei and Heizaemon, and for nine years I have been residing there, renting farmers' land.

However, nine years ago, there was a summons from Mount Minobu to become the temple administrator, with direct written orders by special messenger, and letters from disciples Shizen-in and Daigi-in representing the great clergy of the entire mountain community. For preparations and such, I was assigned to Zenryū-ji temple in Shitaya, one of the three Edo temples. I was also given the temple name Kanro-in. The head priest of Minobu, Rokuga-in Nichichō, was a disciple of Genpolitsu of Fukakusa in Kyoto, and a disciple of the venerable Emyō, who was a disciple of Master Nichikō. He became the abbot of Kōshō-ji temple in Sendai and competed with the venerable Nikkō of Takidani in Noto Province for the succession at Minobu.

During three years of legal proceedings, Nikkō passed away, so Nichichō was appointed by the authorities. However, I considered myself too young for the great responsibility of administrator of Minobu, and due to old age and illness, I declined the position. The following year, when Minobu held a ceremony of one thousand sūtra recitations at Jōshin-ji temple in Fukagawa, Edo, I left my village to attend and served throughout the thousand recitations, offering my respects.

Before this, when Usami Kinshichi of Chōja-machi went on pilgrimage to Minobu, on the white lining of a purple ceremonial robe, it was written "Given to the venerable Nichijō of Kanro-in, resident of Ōno village in Kazusa Province, on the occasion of granting permission for the purple robe," with the year and date and the seal of Nichichō of Mount Minobu. Usami Kinshichi expressed his gratitude and brought it back when he returned home.

I mentioned this matter previously, but I write it again here in the context of recording the lineage of Ōmon. As you know, my taking religious vows was purely for the sake of concurrent study, and I had absolutely no desire for worldly advancement. Even when I shaved my head and donned robes at Kominato, I had barely learned to recite a single sūtra, and my wish was to move to Fukakusa in Kyoto and wait for death. However, since the venerable Nichikō was still not even middle-aged, and especially since he had lived carelessly from his youth, it was quite...

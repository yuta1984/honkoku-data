The month that tends the gods' absence - honestly, the winter rain falls

Stepping through unswept fallen leaves in the garden - who comes sneaking stealthily?

In this world, people with more urgent business than mine - their footprints in the frost on the bridge

Brushing what might be frost or snow from my sleeve - whiter still is the winter night's moon

When snow falls, barricaded in the kotatsu tower - there's no vigor to sally forth and fight

Until they look like a group of court ladies - snow like cotton caps on every tree

No need to stop the horse and brush off sleeves - in a monk's raincoat in the snowy evening

Even if people call me a dog, in the falling snow - I think I'll follow my own tracks and go out

Sky and sea as one, and the moon over Nakagawa - plovers alight on the sparse pine trees

Though it's a landscape with Hie's cock market - there are indeed potato-digging monks

Especially today, celebrating the many fine things at the gathering place - the golden-tailed hawk

Flowers in golden cups on silver stands - people say without words: narcissus

Behind Asakusa: white-root pine, bamboo grove, citrus - what a place, this Hon-Tawara town

What is there to regret now? Since Emperor Jinmu - two thousand years have passed as the year ends

The waves of years about to crest, at every gate - stand the pine mountains of year's end in December

Love

Even the gods of Chihayaburu don't know this path - yet somehow they taught it well

Laying out three tatami mats, the pine needle hairpin - cleaning behind the letter's front side

Three tatami mats, unable to express my heart's feelings - the dust I've twisted, will it become a mountain?

Saying "farewell" and turning away that face like a turned egg - the silk thread won't cut at the crucial moment

Oh eel! What mountain's potato bed is this - that burns my body after separation?

Though I try to stop, the rain's legs are frequent - again I step into love's muddy marsh

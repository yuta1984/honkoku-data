Jōson's note: These hundred poems appear in the "Goman'zai-shū" (Later Manzai Collection), "Saizō-shū" (Saizō Collection), and other collections. Were these selected as particularly excellent works? The name Shukusan-jin apparently comes from the phrase "Shukuzan kotsude Awa to" (Shukuzan, going bald, with Awa province), and he is known to the world by names such as Yomo no Akara and also Neboke Sensei (Master Sleepyhead). His secular name was Ōta Naojirō, and he who was also called Kyōkaen Nanpo was this same person.

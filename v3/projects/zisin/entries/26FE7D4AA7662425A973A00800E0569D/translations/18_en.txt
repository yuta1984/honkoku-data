Imperial messenger Lord Matsudaira Inaba-no-kami came to visit. After everyone received their portions, the legal proceedings began, and within two hours, Kai-no-kami fell asleep. He did not listen to those two legal cases. The imperial messenger was still present at the seat. This behavior was observed. When the imperial messenger returned to his residence and made his respectful report, there was an inquiry about the progress of the legal decisions, so he reported the situation. When there was a suspicious inquiry about Kai-no-kami's lack of proper response during the proceedings, it was difficult to conceal, so the matter was reported. This caused great anger, and through Ōoka Chūshirō and Shimada Tōjūrō, the judgment was delivered at Kai-no-kami's residence. Although severe punishment should have been imposed for such serious misconduct, since he was someone promoted during the current reign, clemency was granted and house confinement was ordered.

Same year: Lord Tachibana Sakon Shōgen was placed under custody (retainer of Lord Kōfu), Ōta Iki-no-kami, placed under custody of Lord Matsudaira Awaji-no-kami and Lord Matsudaira Daizen Dayū (同 Jūzaemon, 同 Jirō Dayū).

Same year: A ship from Kii Province was blown off course by storms, drifted about 300 ri in the southern seas, and reached an uninhabited island. The island was about 17-18 ri in circumference, with 20-30 nearby islands of 6-7 ri and 3-4 ri circumference. Vegetation was extremely lush, with valley streams, rivers with many fish and birds. No beasts were seen. They cut down large trees as markers and brought them back - they resembled palm trees. There was communication from Kii Province stating that ships would be sent again.

1. Kanbun 11 (1671), 3rd month, 28th day: At the residence of Lord Sakai Utanokamī, during an inquiry into a boundary dispute, retainers of Lord Mutsu-no-kami - Date Aki, Harada Kai, Shibata Geki, and Ōta Shima - were summoned.

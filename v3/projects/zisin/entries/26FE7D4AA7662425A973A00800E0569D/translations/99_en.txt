1. The inner circular ring consists of 15 elements representing the nine of heaven and six of earth, with east and west entrances symbolizing the harmonious principle of yin and yang. The outer corners represent Confucianism, the inner circle represents Buddhism, and the central sacred bundles represent Shintoism - these are the three teachings of Shinto, Confucianism, and Buddhism.

1. Seven sacred bundles are erected in the center, with sacred sake, ceremonial gifts, and offerings arranged on three-legged stands as proper items. The chief official Oikaze comes forward to perform ceremonies for the longevity of heaven and earth and the favorable order of wind and rain for a brief period.

1. In general, the four pillars of the ring follow the principles of the I Ching. The interior of the ring is designated as the Supreme Ultimate (Taiji), the left and right entrances represent yin and yang, and the four pillars represent the four seasons and five elements. Adding the central earth element gives wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, or alternatively the five constant virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faithfulness. The ceremonial cords of black, red, and yellow silk are wound starting from the north pillar and ending at the north pillar, representing the purification of those who exit and enter. The north is called extreme yin, and in sumo this is named the "role pillar." The formation made with rice bales is a ceremony for the fulfillment of the five grains.

1. Although the viewing ring differs from fundraising sumo, it should not differ from the unified principles of the I Ching. After the aforementioned ceremonies are completed, four referees emerge from east and west to collect the items that were displayed on the ring. After this,

The referees take the lead as approximately twenty sumo wrestlers at a time emerge in stages, correct their ceremonial posture, and prostrate themselves on the ring. When all are assembled, the referees give a signal. At that time, the unified ring entry is completed and they prostrate again. They enter the enclosure one by one, and in this manner it is completed in six rounds from east and west. The champion wrestlers from east and west wear ceremonial aprons and enter the ring according to the diagram (this diagram is not copied). After this, the referees for name announcements emerge one each from east and west, and sumo matches are conducted. One referee enters inside the ring, then sumo wrestlers emerge from east and west and prostrate themselves. The announcing referee comes onto the ring and calls out in a loud voice "From the east, so-and-so, from the west, so-and-so" as they enter. During this time, those wearing white garments provide water and paper. When the sumo wrestlers approach the ring, the referee calls out and stands in the center, and according to ancient law they engage without waiting. The referee announces the winner by name. Moreover, the referees take turns, all wearing court caps and plain robes. The match referee emerges with the shoulders of his plain robe drawn up. Additionally, four referees prostrate themselves at the base of the four pillars in attendance. This governs impartial judgment of the matches. These duties were performed by fourteen referees taking turns.

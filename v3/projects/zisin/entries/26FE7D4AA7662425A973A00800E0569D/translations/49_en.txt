<<In a certain year, someone told this story: The great lord of Kaga Province possessed a sword called Chiyotsuru, three shaku and three sun in length. To convert it to the standard measurement and for some purpose, he was going to command the swordsmith Kanetsune of Kanda. On the morning of that day, Kanetsune rose early and went outside his gate, where a woman stood wearing golden brocade robes. She said to Kanetsune: "I beseech you, do not alter this sword. I earnestly request this of you." Kanetsune replied: "I frequently alter swords and blades. What proof do you offer that I should recognize the sword you speak of?" The woman said: "Then take this as proof" and handed him a plain wooden sword handle, repeatedly asking this favor before departing. Thinking this strange, around noon he was summoned by the great lord of Kaga. When he went and was commanded to resize the sword, he was shown the blade to be given to Kanetsune. The golden brocade of the sword bag bore exactly the same crest as the robes worn by the woman. Finding this mysterious, he took it home and compared it with the handle - they were indeed a perfect match. Astonished, he told this story to the samurai inspector who had come, firmly declining the work. When the great lord heard of this, he too abandoned the plan. Truly, masterwork swords cherish their inscriptions, and this is indeed so.>>

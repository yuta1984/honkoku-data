Autumn

The autumn wind that rang the wind chimes clearly - like a one-mon coin on the upper leaves of bush clover

The Milky Way's flowing crossing at various barriers - the ox is Altair, the loom is Vega

If this were the Shirakawa checkpoint, they'd examine inside the long storage chest - the bush clover of Miyagi fields

The maidenflower's mouth also in Sagano just now - the high priest has dropped it

The pampas grass crawling across thousand ri of Musashino - even uninvited, people will stay

The voices of geese crying in the great sky - who wrote this out and hung it up?

Even if autumn's end soon becomes seasoned broth of maple leaves - the deer cry without knowing

Not knowing whose heart to resent, the morning frost - cursing, resentful dew that moistens

A world that appears so lovely to behold - how enviously the moon peeks at it

Even clouds worth a fraction clear away - the abacus beads' three-five on the fifteenth night moon

The second moon's shadow that rises with fair copy - is again exceptionally magnificent

Kyōka praising large chrysanthemums on flower paper - folding small chrysanthemums to write is also embarrassing

With seven hundred Jidō and chrysanthemum flowers - are Kōya's sixty and Nachi anything special?

At Mount Tatsuta, those trail markers in the forest grove - warming sake, unknown maple leaves

Even the lower Tatsuta River's tail, with maple leaves thin and thick, exposes red buttocks to farts

The uta-karuta of autumn rice field temporary huts - mushroom hunting unknown though cards are at hand

"Let's return" - entering that village whose name I heard only in the sound of falling chestnuts

Thinking of children with morning-four-evening-three, the monkey's bottom - one persimmon remains bright red on the branch

Taking one, taking two, roasting and eating them - quail cry in Fukakusa village

Scattered maple leaves, bush clover and pampas grass on the main stage - well, today ends this autumn

Winter

○Same year, 7th month: Lord Hijikata Iga-no-kami's domain <<annotation: residence | Iwaki domain>> was confiscated and he was placed in the custody of Lord Sakakibara Shikibu-no-taifu <<annotation: at that time | Toranosuke>>
Exile to Hachijōjima: <<annotation: son of Iga-no-kami's elder brother |>> Hijikata Takumi, <<annotation: Iga-no-kami's younger brother |>> Hayashi Sukenoshin
Placed in custody of Lord Tōdō Sado-no-kami: Seppuku <<annotation: chief retainer |>> Kawai Zusho, <<annotation: same |>> Abe Chōzō
The administration of the aforementioned household was poor, leading to this disturbance. The aforementioned Lord Takumi conspired with Kawai and Abe, leading to successive improper acts. As for Lord Sukenoshin, he submitted a petition to the authorities regarding these matters and withdrew to Kōzuke Province. The origin of this was that Lord Iga-no-kami had no legitimate heir, so he intended to make his younger brother Sukenoshin the successor. However, the retainers argued that Lord Takumi should be the successor as he was the legitimate grandson, so Lord Takumi was summoned to Edo. Lord Sukenoshin thought that while Takumi's succession was reasonable given the lineage, there should have been consultation given the initial circumstances. Since no such consultation occurred and he was displeased, he submitted a petition to the authorities, which led to this investigation and the aforementioned results. Lord Arima Iyo-no-kami:
His domain was confiscated and he was placed in custody of the main family. This was because regarding Lord Hijikata Iga-no-kami's case, Lord Hayashi Sukenoshin went to Lord Iyo-no-kami and reported the matter, but he did not provide proper assistance and his conduct in not understanding family affection was utterly improper, therefore the aforementioned punishment was decreed.

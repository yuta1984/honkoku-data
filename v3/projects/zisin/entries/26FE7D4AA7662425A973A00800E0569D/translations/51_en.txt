Upon completion of the construction, on September 3rd there was a memorial service for the imperial tablet. For this celebration on the 6th, all daimyo were to attend court in full attendance, but a fire broke out in Yamashita-chō and became a great conflagration due to strong winds, so attendance at court was canceled. This fire burned through the Ueno mountains, destroying the main temple quarters and the mausoleum of Genyūin-sama [4th shogun Ietsuna]. This is traditionally called the "Imperial Vow Fire."

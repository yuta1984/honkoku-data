He is a retainer of Lord Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami, and fortunately is currently stationed in this locality on duty rotation. Regarding the matter of the Shogun's viewing, I understand that there are ancient laws and ceremonies from times past. Of course, for us as well, this is a matter of directorship, so we earnestly requested in various ways that the aforementioned Oikaze be summoned and consulted regarding the ceremony of the viewing, and that proper execution of the protocols be ordered. However, finding this troublesome in various ways, we were first told to conduct the ceremony according to the protocols of fundraising sumo and other formal sumo ceremonies. Nevertheless, since this is a rare matter for people of our status, we repeatedly made our request, but were told that such measures were unnecessary and to let the matter pass.

For this reason, we prepared everything from the ring to the four pillars, silk wrapping, and ceremonial cords according to the formal sumo protocols. Then, on the evening of the 10th of the same month at the sixth hour of dusk, word came from the Yoshida family within Lord Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami's household that the elders and referees should come urgently. Accordingly, we went immediately, and today Lord Toda Uneme-no-shō summoned Oikaze and ordered that the Shogun's viewing ceremony be conducted according to ancient laws.

As a result, the ring was immediately rebuilt, and many officials and laborers from the construction office came out and completely rebuilt everything according to Oikaze's directions. Regarding this, we were told that if the referees and sumo wrestlers understood proper etiquette, or if they were ignorant of it, instructions should be given so they would be ready by tomorrow. However, we replied that we generally understood the ancient protocols. Therefore, tomorrow we will receive general instruction at the preparation grounds early and perform our duties without error.

On the dawn of the 11th day of the 6th month, at the sixth hour, all the senior elders, referees, and sumo wrestlers assembled in dyed undergarments, hemp formal wear, and carrying swords at the front of the rice-pounding building outside Takebashi Gate, and entered the venue's rest area to wait in attendance.

　　　　　Traditional Knowledge of the Viewing Ring
1. The space between the four pillars is three ken square. Inside from pillar to pillar, the ring consists of 7 bales each on four sides, totaling 28 bales representing the 28 constellations of heaven. Combined with the four heavenly kings of Sumeru in the east, west, south, and north directions, the total number is 36, representing the geographical and mystical principles governing the ancient system of 36 sumo wrestlers.

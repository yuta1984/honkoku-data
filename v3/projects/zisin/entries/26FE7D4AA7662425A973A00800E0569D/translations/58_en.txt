21st day: New Year congratulations and thanks were offered as usual. From the beginning of the coming year of the Rooster, those who normally attend the main palace will also attend the West Palace. Additionally, it was proclaimed that tribute offerings should also be made to the West Palace during sankin attendance.

When the year-end private letters to the various daimyo were issued on the 2nd day of the following Rooster year, official letters regarding tribute to the West Palace were issued for the first time.

○Same year: 10,000 koku increases each <<Lord Honda Hōki-no-kami, Lord Akimoto Tajima-no-kami, Lord Matsudaira Ukyō-no-dayū>> 5,000 koku increase: Lord Inagaki Izumi-no-kami

Jōson's second note: This book was originally in the collection of the Nogaki family. The father called Kichiemon, four generations before the current Tetsunosuke, was a person who came as an adopted son from Takasu in Mino Province, and I heard this was sent as a keepsake from his original family. Since he served as castle magistrate for the Owari house, he recorded these things. There were ten volumes in total, and the first five volumes <<namely this book>> were sent to the Suzuki family, or what happened to them, they are now lost. The last five volumes are now kept secretly by the Nogaki family.

<<Note in red ink: The first five volumes that Jōson says were given to the Suzuki family are probably this very book. Though written in the main text, this is among the five volumes transmitted to the Nogaki family. From Hōei onwards, the end is copied in volumes 120 and 121, and should be examined together>>

It is so. Though it resembles thrusting hands, it has a special meaning.

Thrusting Hands and Thrusting Knees
Both thrusting hands and thrusting knees emerge from the body's void, therefore they result in defeat. When one neglects practice, the heart-spirit does not settle, and both hands and feet become stiff and cannot move freely. Since only the spirit rushes, both hands and feet resemble breaking rotten wood. The spirit remembers that technique, but the hands and feet do not.

Floating Feet and High Feet (ukisoku takasoku)
Floating feet are not necessarily the floating of the feet, but the floating of the heart. High feet is the name for feet that go too far or are insufficient. Like floating an object on water, all five body parts lack strength and cannot keep up with the heart. Also, it is written that rules ride upon the character for "feet." Since hands and feet are retainers of the heart, when they cannot keep up with the heart, form collapses and one cannot endure. Even in the abbreviated transmission it states "heart-spirit must respond, and principle is determined first." Therefore, the referee should know only where the heart's single move emerges. This is surely an incorrect view.

Enduring, Advancing, Re-entering Feet (oshibakobi sainyū no soku)
Endurance is the foremost principle of sumo. As recorded before, one endures wherever good or evil emerge. Also, "enduring" is the form of making the upper body soft while the interior endures with fortitude. "Advancing" is the benefit of channeling spirit through hands and feet. "Re-entering" is the heart that enters again, single-minded and able to endure well. A double heart is the source of change, therefore this is warned against. "Feet" does not refer to the feet. Since one knows that spirit rides upon all techniques, the character for feet is used. The idea that only feet float absolutely does not exist. One should know that it is all about the heart floating and connecting to technique. Therefore, one wins by enduring. As the old saying goes, "if one does not endure a little, great plans will be disrupted." Technique is precisely where opportunity rides, like poling a floating boat - the wise man's one mistake, the fool's one gain. Do not win through technique alone, but only through the heart's single move. As the old saying states: "If war is not harmonized, victory cannot be determined." It is about being unified or not being unified. This is called the heart's victory and the heart's defeat.

Criticism of Sumo
Indeed, both winning and losing in sumo all emerge from oneself. Generally, when a person's weakness becomes visible...

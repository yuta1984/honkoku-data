Kai was struck down and killed. Lord Shimada Izumo-no-kami, the inspector, was present as witness. Hachiya had come as a guide and was a caretaker official.
[Poem]: "Hyōbu-kata Kai, how gallantly Aki met his end, Utano now faces difficult times ahead"

Same year: Imperial messenger Lord Ishikawa Iki-no-kami drowned in a storm while crossing at Kuwana. He was traveling to participate in memorial services at Nikkō.

Same year, 7th month, 28th day: Prince Kin of the Ryukyu Kingdom came as an envoy to offer congratulations on the succession of King Shō Tei of Chūzan.

1. Kanbun 12 (1672), 2nd month, 19th day: In Lord Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami's domain of Higo Yatsushiro, the castle keep and turret were destroyed by lightning and fire, killing fifteen people.

Same year: Lord Hoshina Higo-no-kami died and was buried according to Confucian rites. [Note by Jōson: Since Lord Hoshina Masayuki Chūjō, the Hoshina family has followed Shinto funeral rites. The claim of Confucian burial may be an error.]

Same year [11th year of Hai, 6th month]: One tortoiseshell lantern, one narwhal horn, one sandalwood piece, two coral branch beads, two character magnifying glasses (large and small), one Dutch box - these six items were stored in the treasure house of Nikkōsan Buddha Hall.

Same year, 7th month: An envoy came from the Ryukyu Kingdom for the succession ceremony. [Note by Jōson: Last year's entry mentions Prince Kin came as congratulatory envoy for the succession. Perhaps this is a duplicate entry, or since this says "succession," it may refer to succession in that country.]
Chūzan King's Envoy: Prince Kin
Tribute presented:
Sacred sword, silver horse代 50 pieces, plus other local products

Eleven high officials (called親雲土, equivalent to chamberlains), five pages (Ōshiro Satoko, Omojirō, Matsukane, Tarōkane, Shinsaburō), plus musicians and other officials totaling 76 people came.

Same year, 11th month: The deliberations on the Ise Inner and Outer Shrine legal case were concluded, resulting in banishment from the sacred domains (Outer Shrine's Nakanishi Tanba, same Mikkaichi Tateana, same their associates).
The document in Nakanishi Tanba's possession had "Both Grand Priests" written at the top. The character "both" was added later, and the ink color is clearly newer. Moreover, there is no clear precedent for the title "Both Grand Shrines," and this was entirely an attempt to deceive the government, so the above punishment was ordered. Furthermore, it was decreed that if either shrine proposes any new matters in the future, it shall be considered a crime.

Same year: A minor guard named Matsukaze Sahyōe, with a stipend of 100 koku and support for 10 men, had consistently bad conduct and no servants. Due to his misconduct, he was placed under the custody of Lord Matsudaira Kai-no-kami.

1. Kanbun 13 (1673) Imperial Linked Verse:
"Pine trees, just the spring colors of our reign's prosperity" - Shōriku
"To plum blossoms, a thousand years of young branches added in spring"
"Through jeweled doors, the light appears so peaceful" - Sonā

Same year [12th year], 2nd month, 2nd day, night: A vendetta occurred within Lord Toda Shichinosuke's group residence compound on Jōruri-zaka in Ichigaya. This involved retainers of Lord Okudaira Daizen-no-suke: Okudaira Genpachi, Natsume Geki, Okudaira Denzō, and 14-15 others of high and low rank, Honda Hansuke...
[Note by Jōson: What the world calls the Utsunomiya Vendetta refers to this incident.]

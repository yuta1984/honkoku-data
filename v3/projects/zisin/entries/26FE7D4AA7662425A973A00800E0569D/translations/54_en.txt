The management of his domain was deemed improper and inappropriate. His castle grounds were confiscated, he was granted 10,000 koku, his residence was given the upper mansion of Lord Asano Takumi-no-kami in Honjo, and he was ordered to remain in house confinement. This was announced at the residence of Lord Tsuchiya Sagami-no-kami.

His retainers: Asai Shinemon, Tako Heizō, Nishio Jidayū, Suga Kinzaemon
These four men acted as leaders and had twenty-five men sign a joint petition, forming a faction. For this inappropriate conduct, they were sentenced to death.

The above 10,000 koku was transferred within Kubiki District in Echigo, and Iwamura in Mino Province was taken over by <<Lord Tōyama Izumi-no-kami and Lord Hori Yamato-no-kami>>

○Same month, transfer: <<From Izumi in Ōshū to Annaka in Kōzuke>> Lord Naitō Yamashiro-no-kami; <<From Annaka to Izumi>> Lord Itakura Iyo-no-kami

○Same year, July: Regarding Lord Honda Izumo-no-kami's case, there was a consultation at the Council of Deliberation. At this time he was in the custody of Lord Sakai Saemon-no-jō at the Asakusa lower mansion, but this time he was transferred to the custody of Lord Mizuno Kenmotsu. Two retainers of Lord Izumo-no-kami were attending him, but these men were exiled, as announced to Lord Saemon-no-jō.

Regarding Honda Izumo-no-kami's placement in custody: until the two retainers reported Izumo-[no-kami]'s inappropriate conduct, they had remained without reporting it, which was considered negligent. Izumo was transferred to the custody of Lord Mizuno Kenmotsu, and Saemon-no-jō was ordered into house confinement.

Announcement: Honda Izumo

Initially there were various acts of cruelty, and he was placed in the custody of Lord Sakai Saemon-no-jō. His retainers' improper service was repeatedly inappropriate, and although he should have been sentenced to death, due to his mentally disturbed behavior, he was transferred to the custody of Lord Mizuno Kenmotsu and ordered to be strictly confined.

Exile <<His retainers: Kubayashi Hachidayū, Shimizu Genzaemon>>

These two men, having attended during Izumo's custody, should have served properly in any capacity, but they complained to Saemon-no-jō's retainers that they could not perform their service. This conduct was inappropriate, and therefore they are sentenced to exile.

Regarding this matter, the metsuke who went to Shōnai in Dewa - Lord Ōkubo Gonzaemon and Lord Amano Ichirōzaemon - were ordered into house confinement.

○Same year, August: 10,000 koku, Nagashima in Ise Province - Lord Matsudaira Sado-no-kami

1. In the first year of Jōō (1652), the year of the dragon, in the second month, a great wind struck Kishū (Kii Province), destroying thirty-seven large ships anchored at Shingū port, and over three hundred sailors and others died. This was reported by the lord of Kishū.

In the same year, ninth month, arsonist criminals who were rōnin were arrested in Edo: Bekki Shōzaemon, Fujii Matajūrō, Miyake Heiroku, Hayashi Tazaemon, Toki Yozaemon, and three servants.
The informant was a retainer of Jō Hanzaemon named Gyōbu Zaemon, who was one of their accomplices but became an informant. Among those mentioned above, Toki Yozaemon was persuaded and fled, but after official investigation, he appeared at Kiridōshi, attempted seppuku and cut his throat, but failed to die completely, and was handed over to Lord Ishitani Shōgen for interrogation. The aforementioned informant Nagashima Gyōbu Zaemon was rewarded with 500 koku of rice and was appointed as a direct retainer of the shogun.

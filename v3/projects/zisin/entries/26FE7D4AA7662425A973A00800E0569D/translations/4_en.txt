They broke through and returned. When Lord Shimōsa-no-kami heard of this, he became extremely displeased and ordered that they be killed. He assigned twenty-six attackers, with six men as the advance guard using door bars, who pressed close to Jūrōemon's lodging and struck the gate. When they claimed "We come on official business," the gate was opened, but as they rushed in, four men shot and killed them with guns. As more pressed in, there were also ten ashigaru inside, plus the Kawate father and son and retainers—seventeen or eighteen men in total—all of whom fought and perished. Many of the attackers also died. Mohei's wife fought exceptionally well. Mohei's son-in-law was serving as Edo mansion magistrate, and when orders came to kill him as well, he had gone to the mansion and was playing go when news of this matter arrived. His companions were called and made a commotion, so being a quick-tempered man, he became suspicious, took his sword and returned home, where he was struck down. As they gathered to discuss storming the longhouses to kill more, Lord Shimōsa-no-kami again sent word that there should be no more killing, and it ended with banishment.

In the sixth month of the same year, Zen Master Yinyuan of Ōbaku came to Japan. He was a monk from Jinshan Temple in China. Due to the chaos in China, he came to Japan, and records of his sermons at Nagasaki arrived, which Hayashi Dōshun was ordered to read.

In the same year, kinoto-mi, on the twenty-seventh day of the intercalary sixth month, clear weather. Today at the late hour of the snake (10-11 AM), a courier arrived from Kyoto. On the twenty-third at the hour of the horse (noon), a fire broke out from the gabled roof of the Saisho in the Imperial Palace, and everything within the imperial compound burned down except for the Imperial Library and two treasure houses. However, the Sentō Palace, Shin-in Palace, and Nyōin Palace were unharmed. The east wind was fierce, and the residences of court nobles and courtiers downwind were consumed by the spreading fire. Therefore, the Taiju (Shogun) was extremely alarmed, and though still young, he was particularly grieved. At evening, Aoki Shingobeē was appointed as special envoy, and Shingobeē departed Edo at the hour of the monkey (3-4 PM). Traveling like a flying horse, swift as wind, on the last day of the month, the eastern envoy Aoki Shingobeē arrived in Kyoto. Through the two Densō (Imperial Messengers) ⟨marginal note: Seikanji Dainagon, Nonomiya Dainagon⟩, he conveyed the message: "The Taiju was shocked by this unexpected conflagration and respectfully sends this immediate inquiry." He also conveyed that the Kyoto guard warriors and others, including Nagai Shinano-no-kami, lord of Yodo Castle, and Nagai Hyūga-no-kami, lord of Takatsuki Castle, being in their domains, were ordered to handle all Kyoto official matters. To Shinano-no-kami came special imperial instructions: "While the current Kyoto Deputy is in Edo, Shinano-no-kami shall give orders regarding all matters in the capital and concerning the fire. When Suō-no-kami comes to Kyoto, he should consult and give appropriate guidance"—such was the supreme command.

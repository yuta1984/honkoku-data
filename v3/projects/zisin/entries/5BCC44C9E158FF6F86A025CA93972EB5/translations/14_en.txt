"truly strange. In all directions it is misty and hazy, with clouds hanging at the waist of the mountains, while the peaks appear above the mid-slopes of the mountains. It doesn't look like rain, nor does it seem like it will become windy. In all my years I have never seen such weather," and he was greatly puzzled. At this time, Hiroshima-shi pondered and said, "This is not clouds hanging down, but rather earth vapors rising up. When I was young, I heard from my father that the rising of earth vapors is a sign of earthquakes. There must be no delay, not even for a moment." He hurried back to the inn and informed the master of this, saying, "This place has mountains behind and the sea in front, making it extremely dangerous. Even if it comes again, let us temporarily escape to another place."

He had people send the luggage ahead, made hasty preparations, and departed. When they had traveled what seemed about four ri along the road, while in the mountains, a great earthquake indeed occurred. The ground swayed like beating waves, and the branches of large trees all struck the ground. Rolling and tumbling, they barely managed to escape. At this time, Ogi port experienced landslides, pagodas and halls collapsed, the tide surged and all the houses entered the sea, and large rocks emerged from the sea. From then on, there were small tremors daily, which gradually ceased in the sixth month of the following year. Later, when he reached the gold mines of the same province, he wondered whether the tunnels had surely collapsed and people had been harmed in that earthquake.

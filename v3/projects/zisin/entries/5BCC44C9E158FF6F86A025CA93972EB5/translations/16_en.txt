According to the "Kaiki" (Sophora Records) from the 9th year of Kyōhō, there was once a blind man named Shikata-ichi who was a renowned "chōshi-giki" (one who divines by listening to sounds). When he predicted people's fortunes and misfortunes, joys and sorrows, he was never wrong. He would visit Ōzan frequently and serve in attendance, but in his later years he said, "I have learned useless things and deeply regret it. Every day when I interact with people, all their fortunes and misfortunes echo in my ears, and it is very troublesome." His numerous achievements were indeed countless. This Shikata-ichi rose early one morning, called his servant, and said, "What a terrible sound this is. With this sound, most of the capital will surely be destroyed."

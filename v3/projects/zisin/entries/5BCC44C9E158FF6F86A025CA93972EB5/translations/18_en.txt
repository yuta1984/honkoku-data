This is indeed suspicious. Where good reaches its extreme is misfortune, and where misfortune reaches its extreme is good fortune, so it must be thus. "This is always a tale of meaninglessness," he says. In my humble consideration, Shikata-ichi's divinatory observations were remarkable, worthy of excessive praise. That he already knew of the heaven and earth's anomalies and escaped to Mount Atago was truly excellent! When he reached this mountain and his condition improved, it was regrettable that the disaster still occurred, but this would be the same as the principle that when yin reaches its extreme it transforms into yang, when yang reaches its extreme it gives birth to yin, and when joy reaches its extreme, sorrow is born. At that time, there was a great calamity throughout the capital, so the earthquake energy was overflowing, there was no road to walk on, and no place to escape to. Since Shikata-ichi's body had reached its extreme at this place, conversely, it seems quite natural that his acoustic condition improved.

The "Suwen" Five Phases Theory states: "When wind prevails, the earth moves." The "Strange Phenomena Discrimination" states that according to this theory, earthquakes are the work of wind energy. It also states that there is a folk belief about catfish causing earthquakes. Is this a Buddhist teaching? Did they use wind to represent the catfish? Since fish are yang creatures within yin, they are probably spoken of as analogous to wind. In any case, these are explanations far from true principle. Hakuseki's "Tōga" states that calling earthquakes "naifuru" means that "nai" refers to sound and "furu" refers to movement, meaning rumbling motion. Now common people also say "naiyuru." "Yuru" also means to move. Saying "yurufu" and "yurugasu" are also the same. In ancient language, "yu" was written as "ni"...

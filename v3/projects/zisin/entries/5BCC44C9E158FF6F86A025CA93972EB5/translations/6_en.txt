According to Chomei's Hojoki: "Around the 2nd year of Genryaku (1185), a great earthquake occurred. Its nature was extraordinary. Mountains collapsed and buried rivers, the sea tilted and flooded the land. The earth cracked and water gushed forth, rocks split and tumbled into valleys. Throughout the provinces, boats drifted on the waves, and horses traveling the roads lost their footing and became confused. Moreover, in the vicinity of the capital, not a single hall, building, pagoda, or shrine remained intact in any location. (omitted) Such violent shaking lasted only briefly, but its aftereffects continued for some time. There was not a day without two or three dozen earthquakes strong enough to cause ordinary alarm.

After ten or twenty days had passed, they gradually became less frequent - sometimes four or five times, two or three times, or perhaps once every other day or once every three days. The aftereffects lasted roughly three months."

According to the Tenmon Koyo: "In the 5th month of Kanbun 2 (1662), year of the water-tiger, the land of Kinai shook greatly. Kitae was the most severely affected, with aftershocks occurring repeatedly until the end of the year."

According to the Honcho Tenmon-shi: "On the 29th day of the 2nd month of Horeki 1 (1751), year of the metal-sheep, a great earthquake occurred. Various halls and buildings were destroyed, and aftershocks continued until the 6th or 7th month before stopping."

Among these numerous examples, all begin with a great earthquake, after which smaller movements cease.

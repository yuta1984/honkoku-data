It refers to how [the seismic force] spreads in all directions from that core (shin) and gradually becomes gentler and more relaxed at the periphery, which is called the "end." Therefore, it does not shake from the east nor move from the west, but rather begins to shake from that core (shin) and reaches all directions, with its limits gradually ending in minor tremors. The area that experienced seismic activity this time had Kyōshi (the capital) as its core (shin), extending to nearby provinces, with its periphery reaching Tōbu (eastern military region), Nanki (southern Kii), Hokuetsu (northern Echigo), western Shikoku, and the Chūgoku region.

On the 1st day of the 5th month, there was a great earthquake; Gojō Stone Bridge fell, Kuchiki Valley collapsed, and deaths among the common people continued until the 7th month without stopping." According to Hiroshima-shi's account, in the 11th month of Kyōwa 3, while staying at a port called Ogi in Sado Province on various business, on the morning of the 15th day of the same month, when he went out to a nearby hill with a ship captain whose vessel was moored at the same lodging to observe the weather, the captain said, "Today's weather is

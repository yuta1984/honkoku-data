【Note】
Recently, as earthquakes have not ceased, many people—children, women, and the sick—have been misled by groundless rumors circulating in society, living in fear and distressing their hearts. Therefore, I shall comprehensively present the theories of ancient scholars regarding the causes of earthquakes, and record historical examples showing that after major earthquakes, the tremors subside to minor movements, in order to put people's minds at ease. I also present contemporary accounts of premonitory signs that appear before earthquakes are about to occur, hoping these may serve as aids for preparedness. I have hastily published this work to present to my dear friends in all directions.

It follows the same principle as thunder and lightning. The lands beneath the North Pole are extremely cold, and those beneath the equator are excessively hot, and both have few earthquakes. In sandy soil, the qi is sparse and does not gather, so there are few tremors. In muddy soil, there is no space for qi to be stored, hence few tremors. In warm lands with much stone, there are cavities underground where hot qi blows in and is compressed by cold qi, and when it reaches its limit, it expands and violently strikes that land. For example, when cannons or fire arrows are discharged beneath tall buildings or great towers, there is nothing that does not suffer their shock and impact. However, earthquakes do not occur throughout the entire earth. Tremors are particular to each place, each qi, and each movement.

It is only in one particular place. Due to their intensity, there are various changes. There are not few instances of new mountains appearing on land and new islands in the sea. After an earthquake, when the dry qi underground becomes fiercely compressed and transforms into hot fire before emerging, then the tremor stops.

○Signs of Earthquakes
When an earthquake is about to occur, numerous holes appear in the ground at night, ejecting fine clods of earth, like field mice swarming. This may be a sign of moles and such creatures being pushed upward.

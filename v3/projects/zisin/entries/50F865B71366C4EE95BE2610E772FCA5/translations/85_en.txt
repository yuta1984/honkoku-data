This was during a dry and light season, in densely built areas where water access was poor, so even if a fire spread considerably, it would not exceed two or three chō. However, what is truly fearsome is during times of fierce wind. Regarding these fire prevention measures, henceforth the shopkeepers in the city will form groups of about three to five people each, and during winter and spring these groups will watch out for each other. When fierce winds begin to blow, the magistrate's office will dispatch group dōshin from the natural guardhouses - south of Nihonbashi bridge to Tōri 1-chōme, and north to Muromachi 1-chōme - to beat the hyōshigi (wooden clappers) as an alert for fire prevention vigilance, continuing the relay of signals.

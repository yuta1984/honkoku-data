1. Tenants of rental houses and shops shall form groups of five or three people each, and within these groups they shall mutually watch out for fire hazards.

1. Until now, during times of strong winds, the monthly magistrate's office would summon the minor annual headmen to spread notices throughout all the towns. However, we have heard that in the extensive urban area, the relay of such notices cannot be carried out swiftly and delays occur. From now on, officials will be dispatched to the neighborhood watch posts—for the southern area to Tōri First District, and for the northern area to Muromachi First District—and they shall beat the clappers to communicate fire prevention instructions. Neighboring towns and nearby districts shall continue the relay in succession, extending to the hillside areas and samurai residences.

Annual duty officer Hirezuki [written in red ink]
Regarding the fire prevention duties within the assistance areas of Eitai Bridge and two other bridges mentioned in the document: every year from October to March, bridge guards and local merchants from the same area coordinate to have two people each stationed at the bridge guard posts for night watch duties. However, after strict orders were issued regarding fire prevention, they now conduct patrols every half-hour (30 minutes), and when there is illness or scheduling conflicts, the next shift continues the duty without interruption. Therefore, an additional allowance of 46 ryō 3 bu and 500 mon is being increased for the six months of night watch duties.

We humbly submit this petition in writing.
Item: The permanent guards of Eitaibashi, Risuke and Inosuke, respectfully state that we are grateful for the road construction and repair work that has been undertaken for the uneven sections of the east-west Hirokoji thoroughfare at this bridge. However, regarding our petition submitted on the 18th day of this month requesting that the traveling merchants fund the road construction for the uneven sections in front of the commercial stalls on the east-west Hirokoji, we are most grateful that after inspection, our request was approved as petitioned, which we consider a most fortunate outcome.

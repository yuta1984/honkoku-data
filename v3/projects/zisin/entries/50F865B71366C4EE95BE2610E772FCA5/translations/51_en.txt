Regarding the above matter, after making inquiries twice previously, we assigned the repair contract to Denkichi, a property owner in Kawaguchi-machi, Reiganjima. As the work has now been completed, please instruct the town elders to deliver the said expenses to the same person.

1. Risuke and Inosuke, permanent guards of Eitaibashi, respectfully report: Regarding the uneven sections of the east-west Hiroji thoroughfare at this bridge, we are grateful that road construction and repairs have been carried out. However, for the uneven areas in front of the commercial stalls on the east-west Hiroji, as shown in the attached drawing, we would like to carry out road construction at the expense of the visiting merchants. We humbly request your approval for this matter.

　　A ship rowing through the peaks of white clouds to Yakushiji Temple
　　　The blade of a Chinese plow on Awaji Island

This is said to be an example of a poem whose meaning is difficult to understand. Perhaps similar to this poem, ignorant common people sometimes chant songs as magical incantations. Most of these songs consist of meaningless, incomplete words. Yet these too have the effect of changing people's state of mind and making them calmer. There are not few cases where swellings, intermittent fevers, fish bones stuck in the throat, choking on Japanese pepper, and such ailments have been cured. That people copied and transmitted these and posted them on their gates as comfort for their fearful hearts, though foolish, accords with reason.

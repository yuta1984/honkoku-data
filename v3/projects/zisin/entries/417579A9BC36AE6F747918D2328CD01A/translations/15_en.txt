The stone bridge at Gojō had also been entrusted with passage at this time, and people thought that even if something were to happen, there would be no trouble until the future age when Maitreya Buddha appears in the world to save all beings. Yet the bridge piers, bridge planks, and railings—over twenty ken in length—all fell down. At that time there were people crossing the bridge: one was struck by stones from the bridge piers, was crushed to pieces, and died. Another person, said to be from Hanaya-chō in Nishi-rokujō, rode down on the falling bridge planks and landed below, immediately losing consciousness. He had only suffered minor injuries around his knees, gradually revived, and returned home in a dream-like state, staggering. It was natural that he greatly rejoiced and held celebratory festivities, being such a person of strong fortune.

Pack horses had gathered in large numbers at the bridge approach, but many of the horses became frightened all at once, rearing up and standing on their hind legs, refusing to move even a single step. No matter how much they were pulled or beaten, they would not advance—people found this strange, wondering if the horses had somehow known that the bridge was about to collapse.
　　　It was truly a most mysterious thing.

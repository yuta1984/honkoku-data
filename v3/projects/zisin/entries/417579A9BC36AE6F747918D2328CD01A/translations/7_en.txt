　　　III. The incident where children died at Shimogoryō

The first day of the fifth month is said to be a day of prayer, and it has been customary since ancient times to offer sacred kagura dance and sacred hot water ceremonies at various shrines.
At Shimogoryō Shrine as well, they were offering the sacred hot water ceremony, with people of high and low status, old and young, gathering to worship. Just at that moment, an earthquake began to shake violently, causing all the people to be greatly startled and lose their composure. Those who had climbed up to the worship hall came tumbling down, while those on the ground tried to run out, pushing and shoving against each other, crying and calling out repeatedly, creating a tremendous commotion throughout the area. In the midst of this, two young boys who appeared to be about seven or eight years old lost sight of which direction to flee, lost their senses, and became confused in their judgment.

Having no way to cope and trembling with fear, they clung to a stone lantern. Immediately, that stone lantern swayed and tilted, then broke and toppled over. The two children were crushed beneath it, and from head to hands and feet, no part remained connected - they were torn apart and died, which was truly tragic. People wondered whose children these might be, feeling both horror and pity as they spoke about it among themselves. After a while, the children's parents came running, but although their faces were crushed beyond recognition, the blood-stained clothing was unmistakably theirs. The mother lost consciousness and the father raised his voice, doing nothing but weep.

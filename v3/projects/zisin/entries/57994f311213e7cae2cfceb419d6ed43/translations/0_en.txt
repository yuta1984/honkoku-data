**Main Text**
Abnormal changes in heaven and earth occur when yin and yang mix - in heaven creating thunder and rain, on earth causing earthquakes. Even the protection of gods and Buddha finds it difficult to calm such events.

Shinano Province is Japan's premier highland region, with ten counties and a total yield of 557,300 koku of rice. It is an excellent province with many mountains and rivers, frugal people, abundant local products, and fertile land for the five grains.

However, in the 7th year of Kaei, an unprecedented great earthquake transformed mountains and rivers, destroyed temples, shrines, and homes, caused many deaths of people and horses, and brought suffering through fire and flood disasters.

On the night of the 24th day of the 11th month, at the 4th hour (around 2 AM), suddenly there was mountain rumbling and tremors. The Zenkōji area was particularly severe. Rather than just an earthquake, great mountains collapsed, water overflowed, the ground roared, and the earth split five inches to one foot, or even five feet to one jō (about 3 meters), spewing black and red mud while flame-like phenomena blazed upward.

The main hall, guest hall, kitchen, treasure house, and eighteen temple districts - including Saimon-chō, Tōmon-chō, Iwaseki, Sakura-kōji, and Gondō-chō - were completely shaken and destroyed. Approximately 720 men and women staying at the inns Fujiya Heizaemon and Heigoro, plus about 1,800 other inn guests of all ages, roughly 1,070 local residents, and 184 courtesans from Gondō-chō all died instantly.

Those who had taken refuge in the main hall that night or desperately chanted Buddhist prayers while rushing into the hall escaped the great disaster. This was entirely due to the vast benefits of the venerated Amida Buddha statue transmitted through three countries.

**Regional Damage Reports**
- Zenkōji area: 5,390 completely destroyed houses, over 2,200 half-destroyed, approximately 2,700 deaths, 9,000 injured, 173 horses and 2 cattle lost
- Minochi County: 430 deaths, many villages along the Tamba River swept away
- Sarashina County: Houses in Inariyama were swept away by flood on the 28th; Mount Iwakura (18-19 jō high) collapsed, causing massive flooding
- Azumi County: All 380 houses in Shinmachi destroyed, then burned, followed by floods 2 jō high
- Various other counties reported significant damage with collapsed houses, injuries, and deaths

This great earthquake in the two provinces of Shin'etsu was truly a rare catastrophe. While earthquakes have occurred throughout history, never before had the earth split open spewing mud and sand, with such massive destruction of mountains and loss of human and animal life.

On April 13th at 7 PM, mountains and valleys suddenly roared, water burst through, flooding the Kawanakajima area up to Matsudai castle town, washing away riverside villages. Approximately 300 villages were flooded, with total deaths exceeding 20,000 people, countless injuries, 572 horses and 22 cattle lost.

In response to such disasters, the governors and domain lords showed mercy like mothers caring for children, providing generous relief aid and benevolent rescue efforts. This record serves so that people will not forget the nation's benevolence during these peaceful times.

At this time, the rōjū conveyed the following message from higher authorities: "Regarding the succession of rule, [the Shogun] is pleased that an envoy has been sent from such a distant land, and bestows silver and ceremonial robes upon the King of Chūzan. From Ōgosho-sama to Dainagon-sama." Upon hearing this, both Satsuma-no-kami and Prince Gushikawa bowed.

From Ōgosho-sama:
　300 pieces of silver　to the King of Chūzan

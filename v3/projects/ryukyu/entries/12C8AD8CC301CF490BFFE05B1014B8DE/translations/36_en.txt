Regarding the matter of the shogunal succession, in order to
offer our congratulations, we are sending Prince Gushikawa
as an envoy this time, presenting gifts as listed in the catalog.
We are grateful that he was summoned before your presence
and that you showed your pleasure at this occasion. Matsudaira
Satsuma-no-kami will convey further details. With great respect,
I humbly submit this.

They placed it on the eastern side of the San-no-ma, near the threshold.
At this time, Gushikawa took his seat up to the center of the Ni-no-ma,
and a rōjū conveyed to Gushikawa that white silver would be bestowed upon all the attendants, and furthermore, since they had performed music today, ceremonial garments would be bestowed upon the musicians. Gushikawa bowed and withdrew to the Shi-no-ma. The silver trays were taken toward the carriage entrance, and Gushikawa withdrew to the Tenjō-no-ma. Two ōmetsuke served as guides.

First, the Lord of Satsuma bowed to the rōjū and withdrew to the Tenjō-no-ma.

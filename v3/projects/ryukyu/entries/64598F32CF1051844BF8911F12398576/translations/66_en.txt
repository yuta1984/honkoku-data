As described above, [Ōgimi] takes his seat and has an audience within the threshold of the lower tier. The gōsōja-ban makes the formal announcement, and he is summoned to the middle tier. The shōgun expresses his appreciation, saying "It is commendable that the Ryukyu envoy has been brought from such a distant land." The rōjū respond appropriately and withdraw to the waiting room.

At that time, Tsushima-no-kami is summoned, and regarding Ōgimi's audience, it is proclaimed that "he shall be summoned before [the shōgun]." In the waiting room, Tsushima-no-kami conveys the content of this proclamation to Bungo-no-kami.

However, during Ōgimi's formal greeting ceremony, Bungo-no-kami remains in attendance outside the sliding doors.

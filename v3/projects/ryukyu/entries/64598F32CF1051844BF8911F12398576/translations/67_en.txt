1. Tsushima-no-kami is summoned, and it is proclaimed that the shōgun appreciates Ōgimi's arduous journey from distant lands. In the waiting room, Tsushima-no-kami conveys the content of this proclamation to Bungo-no-kami. Immediately, Bungo-no-kami transmits this to Ōgimi, who respectfully acknowledges it, and Bungo-no-kami reports this acknowledgment back to Tsushima-no-kami.

1. Ōgimi appears again and performs his personal formal greeting with three prostrations on the wooden veranda. The gōsōja-ban makes the announcement and withdraws. Two ōmetsuke escort him to the palace hall where he is seated in the lower tier with those of equal rank. Bungo-no-kami also withdraws to the palace hall.

Looking at the world, who can truly attain such fulfillment? The fragrant reputation of the cinnamon tree flourishes, and such longevity among all things is truly rare. Peace, tranquility, fortune, and longevity all converge here, year after year continuously, as heaven is eternal and earth endures.

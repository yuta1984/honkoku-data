attended, and the Kikoe-Ōgimi (highest priestess) also attended with priestesses in attendance. As planned, the god Kimmamun (Lord True Thing) possessed the Kikoe-Ōgimi, and the priestess rhythmically chanted Miseseru, thrusting up the magical Dashikya (tamarisk wood) she held in her hand, waving and shaking bundles of blue wood and pampas grass to perform purification actions, then planted these in the ground as a final seal. Kimmamun was believed to be the highest god of this era. In a state resembling divine possession, she probably solemnly recited the phrases she had learned to chant. The Miseseru from that time is as follows:

1. Yaraza shrine, Yaheza shrine,
   Stone foundations, true foundations,
   Built up high, piled up high,
   In the three-island world, in the royal world,
   World-inheriting shrine, the nation's true stronghold,
   Constructed well, crafted well,
   Dashikya wood, thrust and planted,
   Blue wood and pampas grass, sealed with,
   Fields purified, channels cleansed.
   (Translation) Yaraza shrine, Yaheza shrine,
               Stone foundations, true foundations,

[Right page, lower section]
               Built up and granted, piled up and granted,
               In the three-island world too, in the royal world too,
               World-inheriting shrine, the nation's true stronghold
               Made and granted, crafted and granted,
               Tamarisk wood, thrust and planted,
               With blue wood and pampas grass, sealed and granted,
               Fields purified, channels cleansed.

The general meaning is: stones were piled up at Yaraza shrine, and (this shrine) was constructed as a stronghold of the nation, governing the world even under the Shuri king's rule (the three islands refer to Shuri). Magical tamarisk wood was thrust up, and fields were purified and the sea cleansed with blue wood and pampas grass as a final seal.

1. Dashikya-kugi - A shrub 2-3 meters high with hard wood, used for walking sticks. It has been carried as protection against evil spirits since ancient times. Whether "kugi" means nail or small tree (shrub) is unclear.

2. Azaka-gane, Todome-wachie - Azaka is the ancient name for Ryukyu blue wood. Gane is now called "geen" and refers to pampas grass. Besides these two, (unclear plant name) tips were cut and bundled together in threes as ritual implements for priestesses. Azaka-gane, Todome-wachie does not mean to stop the azaka and gane, but to use azaka and gane to seal against evil spirits.

Since it's verse, it feels somewhat inadequate in expression, but the general meaning is conveyed. The king ordered four officials to compose an Eto (song) based on this auspicious Miseseru. That Eto-Omoro is volume 13, number 18

[of the Omoro collection].

Besides this, Miseseru also appears in the Madama Harbor stone inscription. There are also ten in the "Ryūkyū-koku Yurai-ki" (Records of the Origins of the Ryukyu Kingdom, 1713) and one in the "Kumejima Nikki" (Kumejima Diary, 1703). The Kumejima version has deteriorated to an almost meaningless degree, while the Iheya version has become close to the form of Nodategoto.

It is noteworthy that at the end of Iheya Miseseru and Nodategoto, phrases like "With these words, dance" or "With these words, sing and dance" are recorded.

Miseseru simply repeats couplets of five words each with rhyme, creating a solemn atmosphere befitting divine language, but because it preferred to use archaic words, it was the first among chanted forms to disappear.

Otakabe-goto: Otakabe is an abbreviation of "O-takabe-goto" (words of veneration), also called Nodategoto. It means to praise and revere the gods, and Nodate means to proclaim and announce one's wishes. While Miseseru represents the gods' own words, this represents the priestesses' words in dialogue with the gods. In ancient times, gods and priestesses formed almost a unity, but as time progressed, their separation grew larger.

The format of Otakabe, for example in Otakabe to the fire god, is divided into four parts: (1) beginning by chanting the fire god's name, (2) praising their noble ori-

gin to win the god's favor, (3) announcing one's name for self-introduction, and (4) stating one's wishes. (See "Sun Worship and Fire Gods" for (1) and (2).)

Examples of (3) and (4): "On this auspicious day, the chief Noro of the Oshi-wake, leading seven royal priestesses, though it is fearsome to imitate the gods, at the villagers' request we perform rain prayers," introducing themselves and explaining the reason for the Otakabe ("imitating gods" refers to ancient people who became gods. Later generations called ancient times the age of gods, and the next era the age of aji lords). Then: "The king's rice fields in Shuri shrine desire rain, all withered and gaping, so please send down rain, gently to each field, peacefully grant it, overflowing the ridges, for the sake of Buddha flowers, for the sake of golden fruit, for the sake of stone fruit," concluding with the statement of wishes.

In another Otakabe: "The fields thirst for water, waiting with mouths agape, we cannot wait three days, four days is too long, right now at noon, please send down rain" "However, we don't want the wind that comes with rain, please send only rain, gently." This frankly expresses the true feelings of farmers in a typhoon region.

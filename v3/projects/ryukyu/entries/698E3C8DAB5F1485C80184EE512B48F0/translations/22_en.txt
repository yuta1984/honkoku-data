What Tahisa-oi states in his "Nihon-ki Uta no Kai" and other works is that "the Sea God's Palace is the present-day Ryukyu Kingdom," presenting various pieces of evidence for this claim. However, this represents private speculation made without faith in ancient traditions, and can truly be called a most appropriate argument. Since ancient times, there has been much forced interpretation based merely on superficial similarities between events, and all such theories, being based on speculation, should not be trusted as they are unfounded assertions.

Argument that Uruma Island is not Ryukyu

In "Kyūai Zuihitsu," "Kazan Zatsudan," and other works, it is stated that "the country of Uruma is Ryukyu." This appears to be based on the fact that there is mention of "Uruma Island" in a booklet called "Sagoromo," which is annotated in Shōha's commentary "Shitahimo" as "being Ryukyu," but this is an error. Uruma is a tributary island of Silla 《marginal note: present-day Korea》 and is not Ryukyu; they are naturally separate. The evidence for this is found in the "Collection of Major Counselor Kintō," which has the preface: "A person from Uruma Island of Silla came and, being told that they could not understand what the people here were saying, did not respond," followed by the poem:

"How uncertain—are you a person from Uruma Island, acting as if you know not my resentment?" 《marginal note: In the Senzai-shū, the fourth line reads "waga kotonoha wo"》

Also, in "Honchō Reisō"

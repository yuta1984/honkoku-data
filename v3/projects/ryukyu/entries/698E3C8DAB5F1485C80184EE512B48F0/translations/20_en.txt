With these arrows, he shot down birds perched in trees with his large whistling arrows, and killed those flying in the sky. The islanders trembled with fear and terror. When he declared, "If you do not obey me, I will shoot and kill you in the same manner," they all prostrated themselves and submitted to him. When he asked the name of the island, they replied, "It is called Onigashima (Demon Island)." 《Marginal note: Hōgen Monogatari》This Onigashima (Demon Island) to which Tametomo sailed is precisely the present-day Ryukyu Kingdom. 《Marginal note: Ryukyu Jiryaku》Even now, to the northeast of Ryukyu, there remains a place called Kikaigashima, which is said to be a remnant of this name. 《Marginal note: Nantō-shi》

King Shunten was the son of Tametomo
Tametomo, following the ocean currents from Izu Ōshima in search of a country, arrived in the Ryukyu Kingdom and united with the sister of the Ōsato Aji, bearing one son. His name was Sonton. He later became the Urasoe Aji. At that time, the king of Ryukyu, a descendant of the 25th generation of the Tenson clan, was destroyed by a powerful retainer named Riyū. At this time, Urasoe Aji Sonton raised the banner of righteousness, gathered troops, and executed Riyū. As a result, the people of the country revered and honored Sonton, making him their ruler. This was King Shunten. From Shunten to Gimoto, three generations ruled for a total of seventy-three years before yielding the throne to Eisō, a descendant of the Tenson clan.

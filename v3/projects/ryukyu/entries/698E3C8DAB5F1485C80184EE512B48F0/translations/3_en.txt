The merchants who were trading with the Western lands (China) by ship were staying in Ryukyu. Though Taichū earnestly requested passage for overseas travel, these people had always feared and been wary of our Imperial nation's military might, so they sternly refused and would not permit it. Thus Taichū came to reside in Ryukyu. A local scholar and Taoist named Ba Kōmei (Ma Xingming) admired Taichū's moral example and looked up to his virtue, arranging for Taichū to stay at Keilin-ji Temple in Shuri Castle. There was no one among the people who did not rejoice and revere him.

Kōmei spoke to Taichū saying: "Although our country is a divine land, it has no historical records from ancient times. Please record these." Taichū then composed the "Ryukyu Shinto Record." He also compiled "Ryukyu Correspondence" for the common people. Its format was modeled after what is called "Teikin往来" (Household Instructions) in our Imperial nation.

Taichū lamented that his original aspirations remained unfulfilled and frequently expressed his desire to return home. However, the local customs were pure and simple, and the people earnestly requested that he remain. For this reason, he stayed on for three years. Though Taichū repeatedly attempted to take his leave, he finally set sail. Monks and laypeople saw him off like a marketplace crowd, filling the harbor. They gazed distantly at his sail and regretted that such traces of this eminent monk would be difficult to encounter again.

Taichū was a follower of Pure Land Buddhism and a leading figure of the so-called Nagoe school. His works totaled approximately twenty-one volumes. I once had the opportunity to examine their general contents. Though I do not follow the same religious path, as a fellow countryman I privately admire his virtue and reputation, and thus describe this in such detail. How could Hokuhō possibly compare to Taichū? Nevertheless, in the completion of this book, demonstrating Taichū's contributions to Ryukyu is also part of my sincere elderly concern.

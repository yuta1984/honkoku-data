In the biography of Chishō Daishi in the Konjaku Monogatari, on the ninth day of the eighth month of Jinshu 3 (853), a Song merchant named Ryōki, who had been in Chinzei (Kyushu) for years, was returning to Song and boarded a ship. The east wind suddenly became swift and the ship flew as if airborne. Meanwhile, on the 13th at the hour of the monkey (3-5 PM), a north wind arose and they were swept away. The next day around the hour of the dragon (7-9 AM), they drifted ashore at Ryukyu Kingdom. That country is located in the sea and is a nation that eats people. At that time the wind stopped and they did not know which direction to go. Looking far toward the land, they saw dozens of people holding spears and wandering about. Kin Ryōki saw this and wept sorrowfully. When the priest asked him the reason, he answered: "This country is a place that eats people. Alas, I am about to lose my life here." Upon hearing this, the priest immediately concentrated his mind and invoked Fudō-son. 《The biography compiled by Miyoshi no Kiyoyuki also has the same content.》

This may be the first appearance of Ryukyu in our country's literature. Now, the statement here that Ryukyu is a country that eats people is naturally an error in legend, which goes without explanation, but it is not without some basis. Considering that the Book of Sui states "The people of the country like to attack each other" and so forth, and "They take those who die in battle, gather together and eat them," it seems that the tradition that Ryukyu people were cannibals, which had been told in China from ancient times, was also transmitted and told in our country. From this we can also understand that although that country is close to our country, there was absolutely no communication...

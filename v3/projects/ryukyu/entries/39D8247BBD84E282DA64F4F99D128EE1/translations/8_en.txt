In the year gengzi when he was fifteen years old, there were frequently miraculous omens, and when he grew up he became the Urasoe Aji. The people supported his governance,
and in judicial matters he never went against Heaven's will. When the government of the 25th generation of Tenson declined, the treacherous retainer Riyu relied on imperial favor to seize power,
poisoned his lord and established himself as ruler. Shunten attacked him, and Riyu died. The various aji supported and enthroned him.
He rewarded merit and punished crimes, so the people were at peace and the country prospered. He reigned for fifty-one years, lived to seventy-two years of age, and died in Jiaxi
1st year, dingyu.

　Gihon
In Chunyou 9th year, jiyou of the Song Dynasty, Gihon succeeded to the throne.
　Gihon was Shunba Junki's first son, born in Kaixi 2nd year, bingyin. At forty-four years of age he

years. Gihon abdicated and withdrew to the northern mountains. His total reign was eleven years, and he lived to fifty-four years of age.
　　From Shunten to Gihon, a total of three generations spanning seventy-three years.

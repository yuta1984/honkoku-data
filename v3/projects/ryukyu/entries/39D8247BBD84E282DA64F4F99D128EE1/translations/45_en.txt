the established practices apply equally to far and near. Your Ryukyu Kingdom, though located far at the corner of the sea, has gradually received imperial teaching and has long practiced proper duties and demonstrated loyalty across generations. The former king Shō Sei clearly received noble rank and investiture, and more than twenty years have passed. Now that he has passed away, the tributary state has requested investiture for Crown Prince Gen. We consider that he emulates virtue and that the hearts of the people turn to him in attachment, so it is appropriate that he succeed to the throne. We specially dispatch Chief Envoy Guo Rulin, Right Vice Director of the Office of Scrutiny for Justice, and Deputy Envoy Li Jichun of the Court of Imperial Entertainments, to carry this edict and proceed to invest him as King of Ryukyu's Chūzan. We also bestow upon him leather cap, crown, court robes, and other items. The king should carefully observe proprieties and deepen his loyal diligence. All court officials and elders in the kingdom should unite in support to assist the king, cultivate themselves, encourage good conduct, and thereby preserve the feudatory state. Therefore, this edict is proclaimed so that all may know." The king sent his uncle Minamoto no Toku to accompany Rulin and others to express gratitude. Initially, the king presented forty taels of gold to Rulin as thanks, but it was declined. At this point, Minamoto no Toku and others brought the previously offered gold and requested instructions. Emperor Shizong said, "When the court sends envoys, there is no principle of accepting thanks," and issued an edict allowing Rulin and others to decline. Subsequently, in recognition of the two ministers' long journey and distinguished service, each was granted silver and silk.

In the forty-second year, the king sent Grand Master for Policy Deliberation Zheng Xian to present tribute and repatriate Chinese people who had drifted [to Ryukyu]. Emperor Shizong issued an edict of praise and bestowed money and silk. Xian accordingly memorialized that their kingdom also had people who had drifted to China, requesting that border officials be ordered to care for and repatriate them. This memorial was forwarded to the relevant coastal authorities.

In the forty-fourth year, the king sent Chronicler Liang Zhuo to present horses and local products as tribute, and to repatriate Chinese captives obtained by the kingdom's Hokuzan garrison commander Zheng Du. Emperor Shizong praised the king's loyalty and obedience, again issued an edict of commendation, and bestowed fifty taels of silver and four sets of colored silk, with Zhuo and Du each receiving twenty taels and one set.

In the ■【likely "Long"】qing reign period's inaugural year, the king sent envoys to present tribute. Banquets and rewards were as usual. In the second year, the king sent envoys to

Records of Chuzan, Volume 3
　Compiled by Xu Baoguang, Vice-envoy for the Investiture of the King of Ryukyu, granted the first-rank python robe, Hanlin Academy Editor with second-rank promotion

　Genealogy of Chuzan
　　I observe that the previous envoy Wang Ji's errors in the "Chronicle of Chuzan" all stemmed from adopting records from the former Ming period.
　　When Wang Yu compiled the Ming History, his collection was quite detailed and complete, but all spoke of those involved in
　　tributary relations with the Middle Kingdom (Chinese court), therefore everything was clearly explained. Regarding the succession order within this kingdom,
　　much remained obscure. At that time, the mutual corrections made to what was called the genealogical charts were only one or two matters.
　　Now that I have arrived in this country and searched extensively for what are called genealogical charts, not only do the common people lack such books,
　　but even the national treasury contains no such charts. There are only excerpts of events before Sho Sen'i, named Chu(zan)

Upon succession, Emperor Yingzong sent Secretary Yu Bian and Messenger Liu Xun carrying an imperial edict to the kingdom. The edict stated: "In the past, our imperial ancestors respectfully received Heaven's enlightened mandate to rule over all under Heaven, treating distant and near alike with equal benevolence. In overseas kingdoms, rulers were established to govern their peoples. We, inheriting the great treasure, respectfully uphold established laws to seek eternal tranquility. The late King Shō Hashi of the Middle Mountain Kingdom of Ryukyu served the court respectfully from the previous reign, diligently fulfilling tributary duties, consistent from beginning to end. Now that he has passed away, his heir Shō Chū is sincere, respectful, and prudent, truly resembling his predecessor. Above, he can serve the great [empire]; below, he can protect his people. Now We send Principal Envoy Secretary Yu Bian and Vice Envoy Messenger Liu Xun carrying Our edict to invest him as King of the Middle Mountain Kingdom of Ryukyu to govern state affairs. You, high and low officials and people, should respectfully accept Our command, wholeheartedly assist and support [the king], earnestly practice virtuous ways, so that all the people of the kingdom may enjoy great peace, fulfilling Our benevolent intention to care for all living beings." Additionally, an edict to the king stated: "You sent Chancellor Liang Qiubao to report the death of your father King Shō Hashi, which deeply grieves Us. We specially send envoys to appoint you as King of the Middle Mountain Kingdom of Ryukyu to govern state affairs. You should earnestly continue your father's aspirations, increasingly strengthen your sincerity in serving your superior, respectfully maintain your duties as a vassal, reverently fulfill tributary obligations, kindly govern your people, maintain harmony with neighboring territories, and hopefully enjoy the blessings of eternal peace." Furthermore, [the emperor] bestowed upon the king and queen leather cap ceremonial robes, gold-brocaded layered garments, silk, cloth, and other items. When Bian and others had not yet arrived, Chū had already twice sent envoys to tribute horses and congratulate the New Year of the following year, still styling himself as heir apparent.

In the 9th year, the king sent envoys for tribute four times. Envoy Liang Hui memorialized requesting one sea vessel to facilitate seasonal tribute, and this was granted.

In the 10th year, the king sent envoys for tribute twice, with banquets and rewards as usual.

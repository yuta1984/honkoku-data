...against violating regulations. In the twentieth year (1541), the king sent envoys Yin Dalu and others to present tribute, with banquets and rewards as usual.

In the twenty-first year (1542), Chief Secretary Cai Tingmei invited people from Zhangzhou including Chen Gui and others to sail to the kingdom. They happened to compete for profits with Chaoyang ships, resulting in mutual killings and injuries. Tingmei then settled Gui and others in the old royal castle and confiscated all their assets. Gui and others fled at night but were captured by the guards, and many were killed. Thereupon [Tingmei] falsely accused Gui and others of being bandits, shackled them, and sent them to Fujian. Tingmei carried memorials intending to go to the capital to present his case, but Investigating Censor Xu Zonglu, meeting with officials of the Three Judicial Offices, translated and examined a separate account and reported it. Tingmei and others were detained awaiting orders. The imperial decree stated: "Gui and others violated the law in unauthorized trade; they should be severely punished according to national statutes. Although Ryukyu has long maintained relations with us, now they dare to plunder goods and profits, arbitrarily kill our people, and falsely accuse them of being bandits - such treacherous and disrespectful behavior could not be more extreme. Cai Tingmei should properly be detained and severely punished, but considering that [Ryukyu] has always been a tributary state, we will temporarily release him. If there is no reform in the future, we will immediately cut off tributary relations. Order the officials guarding Fujian to thoroughly inform that country of this."

In the twenty-second year (1543), the king sent Senior Counselor Chen Fu and others to present horses and local products. Banquets and rewards followed precedent, and ceremonial gifts were also given in return to the king. The king requested to send student official Liang Xuan and others back to marry. At that time, Xuan and others had been studying at the National Academy in Nanjing for more than seven years. An edict was issued providing travel funds and post horses, and people were sent to escort them home.

In the twenty-fourth year (1545), the king sent Chief Secretary Liang Xian to present tribute and repatriate Korean castaways. Banquets and rewards were as usual.

In the twenty-sixth year (1547), the king sent Chen Fu to present tribute. Fu came together with Cai Tinghui. Tinghui's ancestor Cai Jing was from Fujian, and during the Yongle period was sent to Ryukyu to serve as a sailor, with his household registration remaining in Fujian. He had family connections with Supervising Secretary Huang Zongkai from previous generations. When Tinghui came at this time, he had dealings with Zongkai and offered gifts and visits, but the matter was discovered and [Zongkai] was arrested.

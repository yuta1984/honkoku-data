He was transferred to omisasoki, which is today's ear-and-eye official. Being forthright and upright, all matters were conducted reasonably, his virtue was remarkable, and the people cherished him. When Shō Toku succeeded to the throne and committed many unjust acts, Shō En earnestly remonstrated, saying, "My lord uses wealth as if it were inexhaustible and kills people as if there were no limit." Shō Toku became angry and would not listen, so [Shō En] again withdrew and hid in Uchima. When Shō Toku died, the heir apparent was young, so the court officials killed him at Madama Castle and requested that omisasoki be established as king to bring peace to the kingdom. Shō En firmly declined, but having no choice, he finally went to Shuri and ascended the throne. He eliminated the tyrannical government and followed what pleased the people, employed mountain hermits according to their talents and abilities, and even distant barbarians all turned their hearts to him.

The Ming Shilu states: In the seventh year of Chenghua (1471), Shō En sent envoys including Cai Jing to submit tribute, reporting his father Shō Toku's death and requesting succession to the title. Emperor Xianzong dispatched Qiu Hong, Vice Director of the Ministry of Revenue, as chief envoy, and Han Wen, an official of the Court of Imperial Entertainments, as vice envoy, carrying ceremonial objects to perform congratulatory and condolence rites, and invested heir apparent Shō En as King of Chūzan.

Manzhi and others requested that, as in the old system, they be given copper coins instead, but this was not permitted. In the eleventh year (1475), the king sent envoy Cheng Peng to submit tribute and petitioned to continue annual tribute as was customary. Emperor Xianzong issued an edict to the king saying: "Your envoys' tribute has already been rewarded as usual and they have been sent back. Recently, the Fujian regional commander memorialized that interpreter Cai Zhang and others, on their return journey through Fuzhou, killed people and robbed property, which was extremely unlawful. Now that the envoys are returning, I specially issue this edict to admonish you. When this edict arrives, the king should investigate

In the 7th year, since among the foreign countries' tribute missions Japan alone had not yet arrived, Xuanzong commanded Palace Eunuch Chai Shan to carry an edict to the country, ordering the king to send people to Japan to instruct them to come to court the following year. Xuanzong commanded the Ministry of Works at the traveling capital to provide one sea-going vessel to the Chūzan tribute envoy Man Tailai Jiezhi, because the tribute envoy said their vessel had been damaged on the journey. This year, the king sent envoys for tribute approximately four times, with banquets and rewards as usual.

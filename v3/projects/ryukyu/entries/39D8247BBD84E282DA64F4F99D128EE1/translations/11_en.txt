Aji Satto Becomes King
　　From Eiso to Seiī, a total of five generations spanning ninety-nine years
　Satto
In Zhizheng 10th year, gengyin of the Yuan Dynasty, Satto ascended the throne
　Satto was the son of Okumagufuoya of Janabaru village in Urasoe magiri. Okumagufuoya engaged in
agriculture and was pure and honest in character. A heavenly maiden descended and gave birth to Satto. Initially he became Urasoe Aji, and when Seiī
died, the heir was five years old and the queen mother was causing political disorder, so the people deposed the heir and installed Satto on the throne. His virtue was profound,
the people submitted to him, disasters decreased daily, and the country became prosperous. According to the Ming Veritable Records, in Hongwu 5th year, an
envoy Yang Zai came to the country bearing an imperial edict. The edict stated: "In ancient times, when emperors governed the world, wherever the sun and moon
shone, regardless of distance, they treated all with equal benevolence. (Below this sentence, the Chūzan Seikan has the additional
passage: 'Thus China was honored and secure, the four barbarians found their proper place, without any intention of forcing their
submission' - 
three sentences) Since the Yuan government lost control, warfare has raged throughout the realm for seventeen years (below are the
two sentences: 'The four quarters and distant lands trusted in treachery and
would not communicate') I rose from commoner status and established my base in Jiangzuo, commanding generals to campaign against the rebellious quarters, pacifying in the west
the Han lord Chen Youliang, capturing in the east the Wu king Zhang Shicheng, pacifying Minyue in the south, and clearing Youyan in the north.
I was elevated by my subjects and ministers to ascend the imperial throne, established the dynastic title for ruling the realm as Great Ming, and
established the era name as Hongwu. (The above passage in the Chūzan Seikan reads: 'I established my foundation in Jiangzuo, swept away the various strongmen,
pacified China, and through the support of subjects and people, have become master of China, with the title Great Ming and
era name Hongwu')
Therefore I have dispatched envoys to foreign lands to proclaim my intentions, and wherever the envoys have gone, rulers have acknowledged vassalage and sent tribute. However,
your Ryukyu lies in the southeast of China, distant across the seas, and notification has not yet reached you, so now I specially dispatch an envoy to
go and inform you. You should understand this. (This passage in the Chūzan Seikan reads: 'Recently having conquered the Yuan capital, with territorial
unity achieved, having already inherited the legitimate succession, I am about to establish peaceful relations with far and near')"

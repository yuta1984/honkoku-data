[The emperor] permitted an increase of five people for tribute missions to the capital and an increase of provisions for twenty additional people.

In the fifth year (1492) and seventh year (1494), Senior Counselor Liang De was sent to present tribute, and the king was granted brocade silk, with Liang De and others being feasted and rewarded as was customary. In the ninth year (1496) and thirteenth year (1500), Senior Counselor Zheng Jiu was sent to present tribute, and the king was granted brocade silk, with Zheng Jiu and others being feasted and rewarded as was customary.

In the fifteenth year (1502), the king sent envoys to present tribute and requested to construct supplementary sea vessels in Fujian for convenience in going and returning, which was approved. In the sixteenth year (1503), the king sent envoys Wu Shi and others to go to the country of Malacca to purchase tribute goods, but they encountered winds and their ship capsized. Wu Shi and 152 others drifted to Hainan, came ashore, and were captured by patrol soldiers. When the Guangdong governor reported this, Emperor Xiaozong commanded that Wu Shi and others be sent to the Fujian governor, who should provide them with provisions and care, and await the return of their country's tribute mission to send them back.

In the seventeenth year (1504), the king sent envoys who stated in detail: "The previous envoys encountered a storm and have not yet returned, causing us to miss the prescribed period of tribute every two years. We now present supplementary tribute." This was accepted.

When Emperor Wuzong ascended the throne, he commanded the Court Envoy Zuo Fu to promulgate an edict to the country. In the second year of Zhengde (1507), the king sent the king's uncle Ya Jia Nishi and others to tribute horses and local products, and memorialized requesting annual tribute. The Ministry of Rites deliberated: "Ryukyu in the past presented tribute irregularly. In the eleventh year of Chenghua, due to improper conduct by envoys, an edict was issued requiring tribute every two years. Now they make this memorial due to violating the tribute schedule, thus attempting to cover their fault. This should not be approved." However, Emperor Wuzong specially permitted it. Registrar Cai Bin memorialized requesting to prepare his own materials and labor to construct two tribute ships. The Ministry of Rites deliberated to have the regional patrol officials verify the facts and recommended measured repairs rather than reconstruction, but Cai Bin memorialized again. Emperor Wuzong said: "Let the two ships be dismantled and reconstructively repaired, but do not exceed the prescribed specifications."

In the fourth year (1509), the king sent Senior Counselor Cheng Lian to present tribute. In the fifth year (1510), he requested that five student officials including Cai Jin enter the Imperial Academy to study. This was permitted, and they were sent to the Southern Academy and provided with clothing and provisions.

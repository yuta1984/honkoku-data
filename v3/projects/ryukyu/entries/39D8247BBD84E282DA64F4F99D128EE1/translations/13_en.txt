surrounded by towering mountains and encircled by seas, forming a nation. If the rites of serving the great [power] are not practiced, what harm could there be? The king is well able to embody [the way of]
nurturing the people like Heaven, and practices the rites of serving the great. Since my ascension to the throne for sixteen years, [you] have annually sent people for court
tribute. I commend the king's utmost sincerity and commanded Shangpei Supervisor Lu Qian to reciprocate the king's sincere courtesy. How could I have expected that [you would] again send an
envoy to express gratitude? Now I have Interior Eunuch Supervisor Deputy Liang Min, together with former Imperial Attendant Lu Qian, carry an imperial document to
bestow upon the king one gold-plated silver seal. Recently envoys returned saying that the three kings of Ryukyu are fighting each other, abandoning agriculture and harming the people. I deeply pity this. The Book of Songs says: 'In fear of Heaven's majesty, thereby preserve it in due time.' Let the king cease warfare and give respite to the people,
diligently cultivate your virtue, then the state will enjoy eternal peace." [The emperor] instructed the Sannan King Shō Satto and Sanhoku
King Haniji, saying: "The Supreme Emperor loves life, and within the universe the living people are numerous. Heaven fears that living
people will mutually harm each other, so it specially creates enlightened ones to rule them. Recently the Ryukyu King Satto has
firmly maintained sincerity in serving the great [power] and sent envoys to report. Moreover, Sannan's Shō Satto also sent people to accompany the
envoys in court audience. Observing their utmost sincerity, it is deeply commendable. Recently envoys returned from the sea saying that the three Ryukyu
kings are fighting each other, abandoning agriculture and destroying human lives. Upon hearing this, I cannot bear the pity.
Now I send envoys to instruct the two kings: if you can embody my intent, cease military action and nurture the people to extend the state's fortune, then Heaven will
bless you. Otherwise, regret will come too late." Thereupon the king, the Sannan king, and Sanhoku king all
sent envoys to express gratitude, and each was bestowed clothing and currency. In the 17th year, the king sent Afuya and others to present tribute and was granted
paper money and currency. In the 18th year, [he] presented a memorial congratulating New Year and tributed local products. Emperor Taizu bestowed upon the king one sea vessel,
and the Sannan king likewise. Moreover, [the emperor] additionally provided the Sannan king and Sanhoku king with camel-knob gold-plated silver seals,
one each. In the 19th year, the king sent Aranpō and others to tribute 120 horses and sulfur.

increasingly prospered and continued [the dynastic line], reverently serving Heaven and the sovereign, growing ever more devout over time. Due to this death, We are deeply grieved. Since you are the royal brother, you should rightfully inherit the state's enfeoffment. We specially dispatch envoys carrying this decree to enfeoff you as King of Chūzan of the Ryukyu Kingdom, and also bestow upon you and your consort caps, robes, colored silk, and other items. You should further cultivate your ministerial integrity and show benevolent care for your people. Be respectful!" In the seventh year, [he] sent envoys to submit tribute, still styling [himself] as royal brother. After the investiture ceremony, [he] sent envoys to express gratitude and again sent envoys to submit tribute. In the second year of Tianshun (1458), the king sent envoys to pay tribute three times. In the third year, the king sent envoy Li Jing to tribute horses and gold and silver vessels, memorializing: "Our kingdom's royal palace suffered a fire that spread to the warehouses, destroying copper coins. We request that following the precedent of the Yongle and Xuande periods, copper coins be granted in exchange for the goods we carry." The Ministry of Rites responded: "Copper coins are used by China and are difficult to provide as grants. It would be appropriate to calculate the paper currency value and, following old practice, provide six parts in raw silk from the capital treasury, with the remaining four parts referred to the Fujian Provincial Administration Commission to store ramie, gauze, silk, cloth and other goods, to be distributed according to current market values." This was followed. The king sent envoys including Yarakaki and others to submit tribute, with banquets and rewards as usual. In the fourth year, the king sent envoys to submit tribute. In the fifth year, the king sent envoys including Wang Cha to tribute horses and local products. In the sixth year, the king sent envoys including Cheng Peng to tribute local products, with banquets and rewards all according to precedent.

According to the "Chūzan Seikan," the construction of various temples and mountains, and large bells were all cast by the king. [He] reigned for seven years, lived to forty-six years old, and died in the fourth year of Tianshun, geng-chen (1460).

[Marginal note: Subject] Upon examination, Shisatsu was not a son of Kinpuku. The "Chūzan Seikan" is mistaken. The "Seisan-zu" (Genealogical Chart) quoted in Wang's record states that Taikyū was the younger brother of Shō Shisatsu, while the Veritable Records state he was the younger brother of Kinpuku. Presumably, the Veritable Records only relied on memorials requesting investiture as evidence, with no other sources available for verification.

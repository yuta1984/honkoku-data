However, every year after the sixth month, great typhoons frequently arise, rain mixed with seawater flies horizontally, and rice and fruits all suffer damage from this. ○ Sugar is made by crushing sugarcane and boiling down the juice. There are brown sugar, white sugar, and rock sugar. There is much in Shuri, and the northern islands have the most. Within the country, it serves as food for nobles and also as a trade item. Tobacco has thin, long leaves. Though produced in various places, it is insufficient because people of all social ranks enjoy it, so much is imported from Osumi. Salt is made by evaporating seawater. The color is white, and there are salt-making facilities in Ginowan, Nakijin, and Naha. Also, the production of salted pork is quite substantial. Tea is scarce, as the soil quality is said to be unsuitable for tea. They particularly prize tea from the mainland, and much also comes from Qing China. For lacquerware such as boxes, cups, and dishes, red lacquer is considered superior. Women make them and men paint them. Awamori is made by first making pure white rice into koji, adding appropriate water, frequently kneading and mixing well by hand, then distilling this and sealing it in round, elongated ceramic jars, placing them under the floor, and frequently rolling these jars. After storing for several years, it is used. The taste is extremely fragrant and strong. According to tradition, long ago a foreigner came and said that since this country lies amid the miasmic mists of the southern seas, people would surely die young. Therefore, he taught a method to avoid poison - this was awamori. Even Satsuma people who do not usually drink alcohol, when stationed in Ryukyu, can drink much awamori without getting drunk. By the time they return to Oshima, they cannot handle several cups, and when they finally return to their home country, they return to being able to handle only one cup as before. Also, textiles develop mold in the intense heat, but if bleached with awamori, the colors immediately become bright. The export of awamori is quite substantial. The production of shochu, clear sake, cloudy sake, vinegar, soy sauce, and miso is the same as on the mainland. Red wine comes from the southern islands. Silk is very scarce, but only Kume Island practices much sericulture. The thread is coarse and black. They weave pongee cloth from it. 《Generally, weaving is women's work, and the loom implements are》

[Marginal note] There are only four households in Shuri that manufacture awamori. Being a poor, small country, they worried that the methods for their one or two specialty products would leak to others, so they had strictly kept these secret from old times. However, it is said that the former Satsuma lord, with special intent, had this transmitted from the king. Presumably, using white rice, kneading by hand, and rolling the jars to bring out the aroma are considered particularly skillful methods. Nevertheless, even when Satsuma people imitate and manufacture it, perhaps because the climate and soil are different, it ultimately does not match that fragrant intensity.

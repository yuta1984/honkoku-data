[The letter] is presented and conveyed to the shogun. This is called a disclosure statement (hirōjō). The following is an example of correspondence from the Kanbun era:

"I respectfully present this letter. Last year, our lord of Satsuma Province, Mitsuhisa, received imperial orders, and I succeeded to the peerage of the Ryukyu Kingdom. To express congratulations, I have attached my retainer Prince Kin to Mitsuhisa and献上 humble local products. I humbly request that through the guidance of the senior councillors, this may reach your august hearing. I am truly fearful and words cannot express my feelings.
　　Kanbun 11, 5th month, 25th day　Chūzan King Shō Tei (seal)
　　　To Lord Itakura Naizen-no-shō (other names omitted)"

"Sending the envoy Kin to present tribute, I have read your letter. The meeting was the same. Last year, regarding the matter reported by Satsuma lord Mitsuhisa about the investiture of the Ryukyu Kingdom, local products were献上 as congratulatory gifts for安堵, the envoy carried these, ascended to the camp as scheduled for披露, and prepared them for imperial inspection. The envoy was summoned and was able to pay respects before the shogun, whose mood was particularly good - truly most fortunate. You may set your distant concerns at ease. I have also instructed the envoy accordingly. That is all.
　　Kanbun 11, 8th month, 9th day　Junior Fourth Rank, Chamberlain and Naizen-no-shō, Minamoto no Ason Shigenori
　　　　Reply to Chūzan King at his residence (other names omitted)"

[Marginal note] The Shimazu clan valued the position of Ryukyu resident official, and unless one was nobility, it was necessarily someone of yōnin rank or above.

When the Shimazu clan succeeded to leadership, they also separately sent envoys to perform congratulatory ceremonies. They established a Ryukyu館 in Kagoshima where kingdom officials constantly served. The Shimazu clan also annually stationed pacification officials in Okinawa. Other treatment was no different from that of retainers - when presenting documents, they were mediated through the chief administrators. I happened to obtain one example of correspondence. Without hesitation about using vernacular text, I present it below:

"I write this letter to inform you. Last year, Lord Yūgorō had a son born, who was given the name Lord Shōnoshin, and was designated as the adopted son of Lord Matahachirō, eldest son of Lord Shimazu Hyōgo."

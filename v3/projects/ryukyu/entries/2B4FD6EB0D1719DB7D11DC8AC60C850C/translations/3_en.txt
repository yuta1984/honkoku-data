　　Tributary Relations

From the reign of Empress Suiko to the end of the Nara period, the southern islands continuously paid tribute to the imperial court, frequently receiving court ranks for the rulers of each island, and sometimes experiencing military campaigns or pacification efforts. After coming under the jurisdiction of the Dazaifu, they made tribute directly to that government office. Subsequently, they often rebelled, and by the reigns of Emperor Rokujō and Emperor Takakura, half had already revolted. After Minamoto no Yoritomo attacked Kikaijima, communication was severed. In the middle period of the Ashikaga, relations resumed, and [Ryukyu] mediated between Ming China and the Ashikaga. In the first year of Kakitsu era, the Ashikaga first placed Ryukyu under the Shimazu clan, and [Ryukyu] regularly came to Hyōgo and paid tribute once every three years. Later, relations were severed again, but during the time of the Toyotomi, communication resumed, and [Ryukyu envoys] frequently traveled to the capital.

one, with nobles using gold and silver, while commoners use copper, lead, brass, etc. Before coming of age, they use long hairpins, and afterwards they use short hairpins. Women's hairpins have no decorations.

The people of the country have given names but no family names. The number of names is merely thirty to forty, so there are many people with the same name. However, fathers and sons cannot have the same name, though there is no restriction between grandfathers and grandsons. Their names include Tarō, Jirō, Omojirō, Omogorō, Shinsaburō, or they use appellations like Matsu (Pine), Tsuru (Crane), Kame (Turtle), etc. Officials have separate Chinese character surnames and given names, but are mostly called by titles like "so-and-so official of such-and-such place." The descendants of Fujian people in Kume village have Chinese character surnames and given names, but separately use Ryukyuan names in daily life.

For entertainment, popular songs from the mainland such as sarugaku, noh chanting, hayashi music, and gidayū are performed, and the three-stringed instrument is generally played. There are also dance music and popular songs from the Ming and Qing dynasties. They also dramatize ancient stories of their own country. Many children of nobles study to become court musicians and child performers. Musical instruments include the three-stringed instrument, kokyū (bowed string instrument), biwa (lute), flute, small gong, trumpet, drums, etc. There are also entertainments of fireworks and boat races. Go and chess are played, and at banquets there are thumb wrestling matches and such.

[Note: Around the Eiroku period (1558-1570), Ryukyu introduced a two-stringed instrument covered with snakeskin. A certain blind person from Sakai in Izumi Province added one string to it, which is said to be the current three-stringed instrument of the mainland.]

[Outside the frame, upper section] The distinction between high and low status is strict. Noble boys are called "Tarō-kana," "Matsu-kana," etc., and next rank are called "Tarō-gwa," "Matsu-gwa," etc. "Kana" is an abbreviation of "kanashi" (beloved), and "gwa" means child - both are honorific terms. The names of people from the Ōshima area are like the names of mainland people, such as Nakaei.

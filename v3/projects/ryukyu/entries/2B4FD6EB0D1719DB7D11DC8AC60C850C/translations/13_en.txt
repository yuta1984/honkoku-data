necessities, and when that is still insufficient, they go to the Tokara Islands and trade with one close allied nation," etc. This "close allied nation" is an indirect reference to Japan. However, their trade uses Japanese ships and is conducted mostly with Japan, and from Japan as well, some thirty to forty ships of about 450 tons capacity are sent annually. Yet from Ryukyu, only one or two ships are sent to China each year, and not a single Chinese ship is allowed to enter Naha. Moreover, when there is danger, they rely only on Japan and seem not to depend on China. Furthermore, Japanese people are frequently seen in Ryukyu, all intermarrying and associating with the natives without reservation, truly as if residing in their home country, and garrison troops also come and are stationed in Naha. However, when Chinese come, they are regarded the same as people from various foreign countries. Moreover, their race, language, and customs, both good and bad, clearly demonstrate that this is a country affiliated with Japan, and especially their physical structure and language are extremely similar. There is no doubt that in ancient times there was colonization from Japan. Nevertheless, half of their civilization and literature owes greatly to Chinese cultural influence, and they send tribute annually, and the Chinese Emperor also, when a new king succeeds to the throne, sends special envoy and grants the royal title, thus forming the structure of an independent nation. However, ultimately, both in practical terms and in terms of political law, Ryukyu is undoubtedly in all matters a tributary state of Japan, and to speak more precisely, it is subject to the Satsuma Lord of Japan," etc.

【Marginal note above】According to international law, a country belongs to where its protection lies. As Perry argues thus, I too have already mentioned this in my introduction. Even in Perry's time, Satsuma sent substantial military preparations and troops, it is said. China has never done such a thing, and the people of the country do not rely on them either. This is solid proof that it is our tributary state.

Race
The Ryukyu chronicle states: The two races of Japan and Ryukyu are very similar. Both races

　The queen consort wears a golden hairpin with a phoenix head design. Court officials are also divided into five ranks, and the hairpins of court ladies all depend on their husbands' official grades.
　The palanquin is a shoulder-carried litter. The pavilion roof and curtains on the palanquin all follow the Chinese style. However, only the king rides in a palanquin. The prime minister, chief justice, and below all use two-person shoulder litters, all of smaller size, with carrying poles attached to the front of the litter, carried by two people front and back. This construction resembles the conveyances of Japan proper.
From the royal princes down to court officials and even slaves, their appearance and clothing can be observed when they come to court. Here we show an image copied from illustrations in the diplomatic records, depicting the king wearing his crown and robes.

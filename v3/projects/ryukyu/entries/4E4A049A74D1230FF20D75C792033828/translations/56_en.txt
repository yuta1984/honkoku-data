After the burning is completed, they return to the open platform. Like all the officials, they give thanks and perform three kneelings and nine kowtows. When the ceremony is finished, they withdraw from formation, and the King holds up the former king's spirit tablet and enters the temple through the gate on the east side, placing it on the eastern spirit seat. They request that both the burning yellow paper and the original imperial edict be kept and offered in the temple. When the ceremony of imperial proclamation is finished, the Chinese envoys change their clothes. The King bows and proceeds to the eastern hall to perform the ceremony of meeting (Since the King has not yet received his investiture, he is called Crown Prince and still maintains his subordinate position. At this point he meets with the envoy officials. The seven banquets begin here, with this being the first banquet). The envoys sit in the east, and the Crown Prince sits in the west. Each performs three bows, offers seats, and presents tea to completion. They request to proceed to the front hall for a banquet. The envoys go to the left, the Crown Prince goes to the right, and they reach the front hall. The envoys sit in the east, the Crown Prince sits in the west and takes his seat (The chief envoy sits in the east, the deputy envoy sits in the west, both facing south). The Crown Prince sits facing northeast. Music is arranged. Tea and wine are all personally presented. The envoys decline. The reciprocal offerings are also declined. When the banquet ends, they request the envoys to take palanquins to Tekisui-mae. The Crown Prince descends the stairs and bows farewell. All officials exit the gate and kneel in farewell. The Crown Prince need not go to the lodge to give thanks on this day, but first sends officials to the lodge to express gratitude for their efforts. The next day, the envoys send officials to enter the royal castle to give thanks for the banquet.

The above is the ceremony of imperial proclamation for the former king, the first banquet.

Ceremony of Investiture: From the envoys' lodge to the Chuzan Royal Palace is ten ri. On the day of investiture, from the former king's temple eastward, red-capped officials' ceremonial guards are arranged flanking the road to the royal palace (The route: turning south from the former king's temple, there is Hachiman Bridge, then going east and crossing hills for about two ri, there is Sashimawari Bridge, also called Chasaki. Going up the hill and proceeding east is called Bansho Ridge.

In the 6th year of Chongzhen of the Ming (1633), Du Sance and Yang Lun created "Lide Peixuanqiong"; in the 3rd year of Kangxi (1664), Zhang Xueli and Wang Gai created "Shengtian Fuling"; in the 22nd year (1683), Wang Ji created "Chaozong Yonglai"; and Vice-envoy Lin Linzhuo left a long couplet of 23 characters.

The Lower Tianfei Temple is located in Naha, on several dozen mu of land in front of the east gate of the Chinese envoy's residence. Upon entering the gate and walking about thirty steps, one reaches the shrine hall. It was built by Chinese envoys Xia Ziyang and Wang Shizhen in the 34th year of Wanli of the Ming (1606). Both sides are occupied by civilian houses, and many of the kingdom's official documents are stored here. There is one bell tower (said to have been donated on New Year's Day of the Dingjou year of Jingtai of the Ming, which corresponds to the first year of Tianshun, during the reign of Ryukyu King Sho Taikyu). Above the main gate is written "Lingying Puji" (Miraculous Response and Universal Salvation). Inside the hall are plaques by Ming and Qing envoys (including "Cihang Pudu" by Du Sance and Yang Lun in the 6th year of Chongzhen of the Ming, "Puji Wanling" by Prefect Xie Bizhen in the 6th year of Shunzhi of the Qing, and "Puji Qunsheng" by Zhang Xueli and Wang Gai in the 2nd year of Kangxi - three plaques in total). These were established by Ming envoys Xia Ziyang and Wang Shizhen in the 34th year of Wanli. On the first and fifteenth days of each month, the Chinese envoys visit the Upper Tianfei Temple to burn incense (Tianfei is considered to be of the Lin family from Putian, and many people with the surname Lin in the kingdom use this designation).

When Chinese envoys first arrive at the residence, on the second day they first visit the Confucian temple to burn incense, then proceed to the Tian-

fei Temple. During the winter solstice, a "Ten Thousand Years Dragon Pavilion" is set up in the Minglun Hall to the left of the temple, where the envoys perform ceremonies according to their rank, and afterward also pay respects to the image of Confucius. This is not done on the first and fifteenth days of the month.

The Chuzan Former Kings' Temple is about two li from the Chinese envoy's residence. In front of the temple are several layers of pine hills, with flowing streams on both sides, and stone paths extending in squares. Wooden memorial arches and dismounting stone monuments are erected on both sides. The temple walls are built entirely of piled oyster stones on all four sides. Three circular gates are built in the center, with two corner gates on the left and right. Inside the gates, the front hall has three bays with a plaque bearing the two characters "Surong" (Solemn Appearance). The main temple has seven bays, with plaques by Qing dynasty envoys above the hall columns (hanging three plaques: "Heshan Daili" by Zhang Xueli, "Yongguan Juecheng" by Wang Ji, and "Shidu Zhongzhen" by Haibao and Xu Baoguang).

The Ceremony of Imperial Sacrifice: On the day of sacrifice at dawn, legal officials, various officials, and those bearing ceremonial drums and regalia gather in front of the Chinese envoy's residence. The envoys open the gate, and after completing their formal visit, they welcome the dragon pavilion and proceed to the central hall of the official residence. Officials carrying scrolls hold two copies of the imperial sacrifice proclamation.

were bestowed, and when returning, gold was given as a farewell gift (taishin), and afterwards the king would send relatives and senior retainers as tributary envoys to express gratitude. Considering this, Ryukyu's requests for investiture from Tang China, regardless of how it was in ancient times, was entirely centered on trade rather than true submission. Since Tang China also [viewed Ryukyu as] a poor and weak small country overseas, unlike the outer vassals such as Korea, Mongolia, and Annam, even if tribute ceased, they would not demand or pursue it. Thus the "Wuzazu" states: "Since [Ryukyu] borders with Japan, attacking it would be extremely easy. How could China possibly cross the great ocean to aid it?" It also says: "The dangers of the sea route are twice that of ancient fortresses." That country is poor and weak, caught between Tang China and Japan, unable to achieve independence. Although it sends envoys to both courts and receives investiture from both, Japan's sea route is closer,

and especially the Ryukyuan and Japanese languages intermingle, customs resemble those of this imperial country, they commonly use the iroha script, and they have learned the popular style of Tamaki Ōhashi, producing skilled calligraphers. (In the "Ryūkyū-dan Furoku," examining a copy of correspondence sent by Prince Yoshimura and Prince Ōgimi, brothers of Prince Ginowan who came to court in the winter of Kansei 2 [1790], to a certain Satsuma retainer, shows it was in Ōhashi style, with writing format, dates, names, and seal styles no different from our correspondence.) They also enjoy sarugaku performances and compose waka poetry. (The travel waka of Prince Yomitanzan Chōkō, who came as an envoy in Meiwa 1 [1764], can be seen in the same book.) Moreover, they obtain implements and goods from our country to aid their daily use. This is entirely because the geographical connection continues to our country, and the natural environment makes it so. With such cultural influence, and recently with strict prohibitions on Satsuma-Ryukyu trade, the amount of silver sent annually to Tang China on tribute ships should decrease, so ultimately trading profits become thin, barely sufficient for a small country's needs. Therefore, they also reduce tribute ships, maintain the old schedule of tribute every two years, and accumulate ten-odd years worth of precious goods

Every year around the third month of spring, they prepare their ships and weigh anchor at Naha Port. After traveling forty-eight ri (Japanese ri measurement), they moor their anchor cables below Mount Kume, wait for favorable winds, and set sail into the open ocean. The waves extend endlessly, and for several days no mountains are visible. With favorable winds, after seven or eight days they reach a place called Wuhu Gate (Five Tiger Gate) within Fuzhou territory. (According to records of sea crossing days in the Denshinroku, eighteen or nineteen days is considered slow, while seven, eight, or nine days is considered fast. The mission record of Imperial Envoy Wang Yi from Kangxi 22 also mentions arriving in three days.) From Naha to this location is over 400 ri by sea route. (Examining the Denshinroku, it states: "Distances of ship travel at sea are all calculated by geng (watches). Some say 100 ri equals one geng, others say 60 ri equals one geng. Some say dividing day and night makes ten geng. When asking sea vessel captains today, all consider the 60 ri theory to be most accurate." This one geng of 60 ri corresponds to seven ri in Japan. One ri in Tang territory corresponds to 5 cho, 8 bu, 3 rin, 3 mo in our measurement. Therefore, if 60 ri corresponds to 7 ri, this is calculated as 50 cho per ri. Calculating with 36 cho per ri gives 9 ri, 25 cho, 9 bu, 8 rin. When the investiture envoys travel to Ryukyu, they exit Wuhu Gate, open to the ocean beyond Eastern Sands, and head southeast.

In forty geng they reach Kume. To return to Fuzhou, they take a somewhat circuitous route northwest, reaching Dinghai Station in fifty geng. Calculating forty geng at Japan's 50 cho per ri gives 280 ri. This is calculated as seven ri per geng in Tang territory using Japanese distance measurements. At 36 cho it becomes over 311 ri. Calculating fifty geng at 50 cho per ri gives 350 ri, which corresponds to over 383 ri at 36 cho per ri. The Sangoku Tsūran's statement that forty geng equals 240 ri in Japan and fifty geng equals 300 ri is greatly mistaken. The main text's statement that from Naha Port to Wuhu Gate is over 400 ri refers to the sea route from Naha to Kume and from Dinghai Station to Wuhu Gate being fifty geng, so both should total over 400 ri.) Beyond Wuhu Gate is a single river with residential houses and farmland on both banks. Ascending this river about five ri, they reach Minan Garrison. Officials inspect the Ryukyu ship, and river mouth interpreters board the Ryukyu ship at this location and proceed to a place called Guanzhe Dun. Here the water is shallow and large ships cannot move freely, so small boats transport the cargo to the Ryukyu lodging while the original ship goes to a place called Yamuzhou.

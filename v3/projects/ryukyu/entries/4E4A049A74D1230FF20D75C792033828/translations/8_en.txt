After defeating [the usurper], the various aji (local lords) recommended Sontoku and installed him as king. He was called Shunten. This corresponds to the third year of Bunji under Emperor Go-Toba of our court, year Teimi {{marginal note: Song | Chun}} {{marginal note: Xi 10 | 4th year}}. Making this the founding ancestor of the Ryukyu royal lineage is like making Emperor Jinmu the ancestor of our imperial line.

Brief Genealogy
Shunten: The Chuzan Seifu (Middle Mountain Genealogy) states: "In the first year of Qiandao of the Southern Song, year Yiyou, Lord Chinzei Tametomo drifted to the kingdom, fathered a child, and returned. His child was named Sontoku, who later became the Urasoe Aji {{marginal note: abbreviated}}. The people acclaimed Sontoku as their lord. This was King Shunten." It also says: "Shunten bore the surname Minamoto and the title Sontoku; his father was Chinzei Hachiro Tametomo, his mother was the sister of the Osato Aji" {{marginal note: it says | it says}} {{marginal note: The Denshin-roku says "Shunten was a descendant of the Japanese imperial family | the son of Osato Aji Tomokimi" and Tomokimi}} {{marginal note: means Tame | tomo}}. The Ryukyu Jiryaku states: "During the Eiman years under Emperor Nijo, Tametomo floated on the sea

and followed the currents seeking land, arriving at the kingdom of Ryukyu. The people feared and submitted to his martial prowess. He changed the name of the country to Ryukyu, eventually married the sister of the Osato Aji and fathered King Shunten. This was in the second year of Qiandao under Song Emperor Xiaozong. Tametomo remained in this country for a long time, but unable to suppress his longing for his homeland, he finally returned to Japan." {{marginal note: Tametomo was | the legitimate grandson of General Yoshiie, Rokujō Hangwan}} {{marginal note: the eighth son of Tameyoshi. At age eighteen, he joined his father on the side of the Retired Emperor in the Hōgen Rebellion. When the military campaign failed, he was exiled to Ōshima in Izu Province. At twenty-nine, he crossed to Oni-ga-shima (Demon Island). After returning to the capital, due to complaints from the people, imperial troops were sent against him in the fourth month of the second year of Kaō under Emperor Takakura, and he committed suicide at thirty-three. Upon examination, what our court calls Oni-ga-shima is present-day Ryukyu. However, when it says Tametomo was exiled to Demon Island at twenty-nine, this refers to the first year of Nin'an under Emperor Rokujō. This year was Eiman 2, and the era name was changed to Nin'an in the eighth month. This corresponds to the second year of Qiandao of the Song. If so, did Tametomo reach that country at twenty-eight? It seems unlikely that he fathered King Shunten in the year he arrived in that country. What is transmitted in our country}}

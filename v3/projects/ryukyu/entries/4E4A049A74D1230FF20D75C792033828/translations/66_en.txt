Examples of Tribute Envoys

According to the Ryukyu Danki (Record of Ryukyu Conversations) - In the winter of Kansei 8 (1796), the gratitude envoy Sho Kaku (Prince Ogimi) had three subordinates who had previously entered Qing China: Tei Shokan (styled Yuko) and Sai Hokin (styled Nissho). These two men were descendants of the Thirty-Six Families granted during the Hongwu and Yongle eras of the Ming Dynasty and were residents of Kumemura. At the Satsuma lord's residence, a retainer named Akasaki recorded in Japanese script their accounts of the scenic places they had visited and the stories they told.

According to this record, Ryukyu's tribute ships consist of two vessels: the first ship carries about 120 people, and the second ship carries about 70 people. The reception tribute ship is a single vessel carrying about 100 people.

[Note: Upon examination, the Ming Dynasty established a tribute ship schedule of tribute once every two years, and the Qing Dynasty also followed this practice of tribute once every two years. The Qing Dynasty's investiture of Sho Eki occurred in Kangxi 58, corresponding to the fourth year of Kyoho (1719) under Emperor Nakamikado in Japan. Since the Denshinroku ends with Sho Eki's investiture year, there is nothing to examine regarding later periods. The change to annual tribute must be a recent development. According to historical records, one year is called "full tribute" with two ships, the following year is called "partial tribute" with one ship; the coming year takes the winter solstice as its deadline, while the departing year takes the Dragon Boat Festival as its deadline. Based on this examination, whether "full" refers to "advance" and "partial" to "reception" may be an error by the interpreters or a mistake in the writer's characters.]

(Looking at them, they are all short walls of whetstone, three to four feet high. In the middle of the road there is a cluster of phoenix bananas (plantains), surrounded by piled stones. Proceeding another half ri or so, there is a gate tablet inscribed "Shurei-no-kuni" (Land of Propriety). The King of Chuzan prostrates himself and receives the imperial edict beneath this gate. The stone walls beside the road are eight to nine feet high. To the left of the road outside the gate is Tenkai Temple, and the area southwest of the temple serves as the king's cemetery. The area within the surrounding walls across the street is called Daimi Hall. Proceeding another half ri or so, one reaches Kankai Gate. This is the castle of the King of Chuzan. It is located on a mountaintop, with whetstone castle walls extending three to four ri around. Viewed from afar, it resembles a skull. This has been recorded since ancient times. It probably refers to the resemblance of its shape. The mountain's form and the hall's position originally face north-south, but since the route from Naha to Chuzan ascends from the western hills, all gates face west. On the stone cliffs outside the castle, "Dragon Hill" is carved on the left and "Tiger Hill" on the right. Each of the four sides of the castle has one gate, with the front Kan-) 

(kai Gate facing west, the rear Keise Gate facing east, the left Sui Gate facing south, and the right Kyukei Gate facing north.) Proceeding through Kankai Gate, one reaches the bottom of the stone cliff. There is the Zuisen (Auspicious Spring). Ascending the cliff, there is a gate facing northwest with a tablet reading "Zuisen." (On both left and right there are covered passages, with two gates called Left Wing and Right Wing, through which one enters the royal palace.) Proceeding further, there is a tower with a tablet reading "Koku-ro" (Water Clock). It faces west. Proceeding further is the Kofuku Gate, facing northwest. Proceeding further is the Hojin Gate. Three gates stand side by side facing west. The royal hall

consists of nine bays, all facing west. Above the hall tower hangs a large tablet with "Chuzan Sedo" (Chuzan Hereditary Land) written by the imperial brush, bestowed when the Kangxi Emperor of Qing invested King Sho Tei. This is the royal palace. The courtyard of the front hall is several dozen mu in area. The left is called the South Tower (facing north). The right is called the North Tower (facing south). There is a plaque reading "Chujun Kaka" (Loyalty and Obedience are Praiseworthy). All banquets for the Chinese envoys are held here. The palace buildings are all sturdy and plain, with many column foundations. Twenty pillars are installed for each bay of building. There are no ornate decorations, nor are they particularly lofty. This is said to be because they are located on a mountaintop with much sea wind.

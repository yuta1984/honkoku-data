　I would like to repeatedly emphasize that the faith of the Okinawan islands is ancestral spirit worship, and that faith in the gods of utaki, the fire god, and others is already a thing of the past.
　In the Miyako and Yaeyama island groups, the penetration of heterogeneous cultures was also thin, and since they suffered little damage in the recent great war, indigenous faith continues to live on, and the performing arts and entertainment intertwined with it remain in the same form as Okinawa half a century ago. This is also connected to agriculture.
　Miyako has much millet and barley cultivation, with sugar cane and sweet potatoes now being primary, while rice cultivation flourishes in Yaeyama. The conditions for the decline and extinction of indigenous faith are fully present: rice variety conversion, advances in cultivation techniques, the spread of education, intensification of communication with the outside world, etc. Therefore, we cannot be optimistic about folk performing arts merely as a matter of the islanders' individuality.

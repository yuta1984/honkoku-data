《Marginal note: Minister》 Bao-guang notes: Records of investiture missions begin with Chen Kan during the Jiajing era of the former Ming dynasty. Up to Wang Ji and others in the twenty-first year of Kangxi, there have been approximately seven missions. When the investiture ships returned to Fujian, they broke masts and lost rudders, encountering extreme dangers. Every time I read these accounts, my heart is moved. Now, carrying the imperial majesty and spiritual protection, the sea gods showed favor, and during this year-long mission, we were fortunate to avoid the dangers of winter storms. During half a month of drifting, we experienced remarkably few waves from passing ships. Even without spare masts and rudders, we ultimately avoided damage. Occasionally there were storms, but upon praying, they immediately ceased. Several hundred people, both high and low ranking, traveled safely and returned. This far exceeded past experiences. We raise our hands in celebration and gratitude, all bearing the imperial grace. As for minor hardships like seasickness and vomiting, these are common to sea voyages - what is there to mention?

Two ship carpenters, four caulkers, two sail makers, two rope makers, two blacksmiths, two tailors, two paper craftsmen, one mounting craftsman, one pastry maker, and one barber.

(Note: Each military personnel may carry personal luggage and goods limited to one hundred catties. Historically, all military personnel on investiture ships crossing the sea have carried commercial goods for trading according to old custom. In the 7th year of Wanli (1579), the investiture envoy Xie Jie from Changle wrote "Record of Eastern Trade." Later regulations from the Hongwu period allowed five hundred people to cross the sea, each carrying one hundred catties of luggage for trade with the Ryukyu people, established as official regulation. In the jiawu mission, they gained ten thousand gold pieces - five hundred people each receiving twenty gold pieces, with the most getting thirty to forty pieces and the least still getting eight to ten pieces. In the xinyou mission, they gained only six thousand gold pieces - five hundred people each getting twelve gold pieces, with the most getting twenty pieces and the least five to six pieces, somewhat disappointing expectations. Therefore, the jimao recruitment could only obtain mediocre personnel, unable to match previous skilled workers. The total gain was barely over three thousand gold pieces - eight pieces per person on average, with the most getting fifteen to sixteen pieces and the least three to four pieces, greatly disappointing expectations.)

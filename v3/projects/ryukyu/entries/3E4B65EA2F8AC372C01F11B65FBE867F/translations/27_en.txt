There are also those from Kun direction. The compass bearings also differ from each other. Now, looking at what is recorded in the Compass Guide (Shinan Guangyi), it speaks exclusively about needle directions, confusedly discussing winds. Moreover, frequently using the Mao needle, they often drift north, not seeing Gumi but seeing Habi instead. Later navigators who might not see the mountains should not trust the Mao needle advocated by those handling the sealed documents. One should deeply study the Xia-Wang records, consider the winds, and use needles like Chen-Xun accordingly. If the ship's hull is lifted up, it will surely not descend to Habi.

[The wind] then turns to the southwest. When typhoons (taifū) and hurricanes (kyokū) first arrive, they are often accompanied by rain. The "nine-descent winds" (kyū-kō-fū), however, bring no rain. During the fifth, sixth, and seventh months, wind and rain arrive together. When sailors observe dark spots in the sky, they immediately furl their sails and secure the rudder strictly to wait for it. In an instant, wind and rain arrive suddenly and stop just as quickly. If preparations are delayed even slightly, there is no time to furl the sails, and the ship may even capsize. A broken rainbow at the horizon is also a sign that a typhoon is approaching. Cloud formations resembling sails are called "broken sails" (ha-han). When they extend to about half the sky and resemble a horseshoe crab's tail, they are called "bent horseshoe crab" (kutsu-gō). Those appearing from the north are more severe than those from other directions. When seawater suddenly changes and the surface becomes dirty like rice bran, and sea snakes float and swim on the water surface, these are also signs that a typhoon is approaching.

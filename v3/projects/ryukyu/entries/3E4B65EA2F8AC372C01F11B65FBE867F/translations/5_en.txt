When examining the national histories in detail, hardly any overview can be found. [Side note: Some suggest that what they call the "Southern Islands"] [Side note: should be identified with this. However, this is merely a general term for the islands south of Satsuma and is insufficient as definitive proof.] Perhaps because the land is remote and distant, and the winds and waves are severe and dangerous - unlike places like Samhan or Balhae where one could cross with even a single reed boat - it was placed outside of consideration and not inquired about.

However, according to popular tradition, during the Hōgen Rebellion, Minamoto no Tametomo was exiled to Izu Ōshima, but then crossed the ocean and reached Ryukyu, where he remained. Now reading this record, in the genealogy of the Chuzan kings regarding King Shunten, the so-called "Asa-kō, descendant of the Japanese imperial family" corresponds in time and the name matches. If this is so, then popular tradition is reliable and has evidence. Shunten was the founding ancestor of Ryukyu's literary culture and was actually the son of Lord Tametomo. Thus, although Ryukyu had not yet paid tribute to our country, it had already been secretly receiving its civilizing influence for a long time.

The Emperor dispatched Chief Envoy Hanlin Academy Examiner Hai Bao and Vice Envoy Hanlin Academy Compiler Xu Baoping to enfeoff the Kingdom of Ryukyu, and they offered sacrifices to the sea god, saying: "The deity has manifested spiritual blessings and secretly supported the imperial plan. You guided the diplomatic mission to proceed swiftly, crossed the vast waves with favorable passage. In the round trip to this distant land, the mission was accomplished without fault, and the national prestige was well extended. This is truly due to the deity's protection. Here we report our gratitude and again offer fragrant sacrifices. May the deity regard this with favor and maintain eternal glory. We respectfully report this."

On the twentieth day, Mizunoe-Tatsu (壬辰). We received the imperial edict and boarded the ship. For consecutive days and nights, the wind had been coming from the northeast, but on this day it turned to the southwest. Therefore, at the first quarter of the Wei hour (未の初), we raised anchor and arrived at Yishan Temple. We offered prayers to the sea god.

Twenty-first day, Mizunoto-Mi (癸巳). At sunrise, southwest wind. At midday we reached Guantou and exited Jinpai Gate. At sunset, before passing Huangxia Point, we dropped anchor.

Twenty-second day, Kinoe-Uma (甲午). At sunrise, Ding-Wei wind. We passed Meihua Head. At midday, the Ding wind carried Wei direction. Riding the tide, we exited Wuhu Gate and set out to sea. We passed Guantang Tail. At sunset we reached Jinshi Gate. At night, at the ninth water-clock hour, the wind turned to Ding-Wei. The accompanying minister Chen Qixiang, holding the rank of Grand Master for Rectification, led the ship captains of his country to take charge of navigation, using the Yi-Chen compass bearing for three and a half watches.

Twenty-third day, Kinoto-Hitsuji (乙未). At sunrise we saw Dongyong behind the ship, approximately one and a half watches distant. With Ding-Wei wind, we used Yi-Mao compass bearing for two watches, approximately eight and a half watches distant from Guantang.

Twenty-fourth day, Hinoe-Saru (丙申). At sunrise, Ding-Wu wind. We continued using Yi-Mao compass bearing. Before midday we passed Mikang Ocean (where the seawater is blue and transparent like indigo, with fine yellow sand like foam continuously spread across the water surface like rice bran). We saw schools of fish paying homage to the water. As the sun was about to set, two large birds came and perched on the mast. That night the wind became increasingly favorable. We used Yi-Mao compass bearing for four watches.

In total, we calculated thirteen and a half watches. We should have seen Jilong Mountain, Huaping, Mianhua and other islets, as well as Pengjia Mountain, but none were visible. At night we used Yi-Mao compass bearing for four and a half watches, totaling seventeen watches. The ship drifted northeast for about one and a half watches.

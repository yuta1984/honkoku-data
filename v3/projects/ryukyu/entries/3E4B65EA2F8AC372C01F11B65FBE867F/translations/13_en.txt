ships are numerous.

When the investiture command was issued, before we subjects arrived in Fujian, Governor-General Manbao sent directives to each garrison to select large ships for use and carry out repairs in advance. All equipment was prepared. The two ships were taken from Ningbo Prefecture in Zhejiang, all being civilian merchant vessels. Compared to the investiture ships of the past, they were equal in size, but the costs were light and arrangements swift. This had never occurred before.

[According to records, when Xu Jing of the Song dynasty served as envoy to Goryeo, the two spirit ships were all granted names by imperial edict. There were six guest ships, making eight ships in total. The Ming investiture ships were sometimes one, sometimes two. Now there are two ships.]

The Number One ship houses the envoys together, while the Number Two ship carries soldiers and servants. The Number One ship has four compartments fore and aft, with each compartment having three levels upper and lower. The bottom level is weighted down with loaded massive stones and stores various articles. The middle level is where the envoys reside. The sides are called "mali" and are divided into two levels with eight rooms left and right to house attendants. The compartment entrance ladder folds twice before one can descend. The compartment interior is about six feet wide, enough to place one bed crosswise. The height is eight to nine feet, with holes cut in the compartment ceiling to serve as skylights, about three feet square to let in light. When it rains, they are immediately covered. During the day it is as dark as night. The compartment deck leaves the right side open for ship operations, while the left side has several stoves and ovens. Plank galleries extend one to two feet beyond the gunwales, with awnings stretched fore and aft to create one or two small shelters. Daily shifts are taken to avoid the sweltering heat in the compartments. Water compartments and water chests have people assigned to manage them, with tokens distributed for water rations. Each person receives one bowl per day. The stern's empty tip serves as the command platform, where flags and banners are raised and rattan shields and bows and arrows are set up. Soldiers and musicians reside above it. Below the command platform is the spirit shrine, where Tianfei and other water deities are worshipped. Below that is the rudder tower, with compass equipment laid out in a small compartment in front of the tower. The bosun, helmsman, and reception envoys who are in charge of navigation reside there. The ship's sides have twelve cannon ports of various sizes, arranged port and starboard. Military equipment corresponds accordingly. There are nine mat and cloth awnings, with three large timbers laid across the compartment deck, fitted with axles for turning and winding

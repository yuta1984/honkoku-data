Clothing (I)
　Without belt
　With collar
　Small notch
　Style
　All garments are loose and wide without rear crossing panels (okumi). The sleeves are large, two to three shaku in length, but do not extend beyond the fingertips. The right collar end creates a notched style and there are no clothing belts. Most are made from banana fiber cloth or banana kudzu. The geometric patterns (kimon) incorporate mixed colors, and men's and women's clothing are all the same. This is called "kin."

Belt (Obi)
　The large belt is one jō four to five shaku in length and six to seven sun in width, wrapped around the waist three to four times. Those with mixed floral brocade ground are most precious, large floral brocade belts are next, those with dragons coiled on yellow or red ground follow, and the lower grades are all mixed-color floral belts.

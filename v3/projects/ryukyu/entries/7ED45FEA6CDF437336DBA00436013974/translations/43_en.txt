Now, having obtained the general outline of the rank system from Minister Cai Wen, and according to what Minister Cheng Shunze showed regarding the official system, their memorial states: The establishment of offices and division of duties in Chuzan (Ryukyu) has been in place for quite some time. Having respectfully encountered the sage Son of Heaven's civilizing influence spreading widely, how dare our country's official ranks not humbly follow and conform? Therefore, we have determined ranks according to original titles, arranged offices high and low in order of merit, and all ministers and officials are appointed based on qualifications, with caps, hairpins, and clothing colors unified and unchangeable. In terms of names, they are the same yet different in rank; in terms of grades, they differ yet are the same. All conform to the old system and harmonize with correct pronunciation, and though there are court ranks, they actually honor the king. The written presentation is clearly divided by categories and appears refined and proper. However, while establishing a nation and creating offices requires equal emphasis on civil and military affairs, currently military positions outside the Ceremonial Guard and Military Equipment Department are greatly abbreviated, and military systems and weaponry are also not recorded in detail. This should await future supplementary investigation and compilation.

Court Dress and Attire
The king wears a black gauze cap with side ornaments, gold-decorated red tassels, a dragon-head gold hairpin, a python robe, and a belt using rhinoceros horn and white jade, all following the clothing system granted by the former Ming Dynasty. The queen consort uses a phoenix-head gold hairpin, and palace ladies are also divided into five ranks of about one hundred people. The hairpins of court ladies all correspond to their husbands' rank and position.

From the first rank downward, there are eight grades of caps, four grades of hairpins, and four grades of belts, listed as follows:

[Upper section]
Senior First Rank: gold hairpin, brocade cap with colored weaving, brocade belt, green robe
Junior First Rank

[Middle section]  
Senior Second Rank / Junior Second Rank: gold hairpin / gold flower with silver stem hairpin
Purple silk cap (those with merit are granted brocade caps)

Deep blue robe (court dress is the same down to the eighth and ninth ranks)

[Lower section]

Legal officers and below normally all use green cloth umbrellas with printed flower patterns, but now I observe that each person uses flowered rain umbrellas, with one person walking in front of each and one person striking a sounding gong.

　　Clans
The four great surnames of Shuri are Shō, Ō, Mō, and Ma. The Shō clan is a branch family of the royal Shō surname. Being distantly related, they are called Shō to distinguish them, so they do not intermarry with the royal family through the generations. Among the native people who have marriage relations with the royal family, only the three families of Ō, Mō, and Ma serve as royal uncles and legal officers through generations. Currently there are three people serving as legal officers: Ma Kenzu, Ō Jidō, Shō Sei[?]koku-jō, and Mō Hōshū. 《Note: The current king Shō Kei's maternal grandfather, and the queen consort is from the Ma clan》 All genealogies are unclear, so we plan to continue research and compile family records.

The thirty-six surnames of Kume are all Min people (Fujian people) granted during the Hongwu and Yongle reigns. By the middle of the Wanli period, only five surnames remained: Cai, Zheng, Liang, Jin, and Lin. In the thirty-fifth year of Wanli, two more surnames were granted: Ruan and Mao. The descendants of each surname have not flourished greatly. There are many others who gained prominence through adoption into registers, but these are not the old families of granted surnames. Now examining the genealogies of the nine surnames, many among them study and practice national learning.

片帽 (Flat Cap)
　The flat caps are all made of black silk, covering the top of the head with a brim below forming six ridges. These are caps worn at home during cold weather. Medical officials, musicians, and those who serve tea in the royal palace and have shaved their hair like monks all wear these.

Kasa (Hat/Conical Hat)
　Most kasa are made from wheat stalks, though there are also leather kasa. The exterior is coated with black lacquer while the interior is painted vermillion.

Short Hairpin (Tanshin)
　Short hairpins for topknots are about three to four sun in length. Those who already wear caps and have removed the hair from the top of their heads insert these. The decorative head is cylindrical, though there are also square columns and hexagonal columns. Gold is most precious, gold heads with silver shafts are next, silver follows, and copper is lowest.

Long Hairpin (Chōshin)
　Long hairpins are over one shaku in length, worn by women and children who arrange large topknots. These also distinguish rank through three grades of gold and silver. Hairpins of common household women are all made of tortoiseshell.

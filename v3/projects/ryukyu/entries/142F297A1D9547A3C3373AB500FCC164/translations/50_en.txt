I respectfully wish to present four packets of banquet gold that were repeatedly returned, totaling 192 taels, with detailed records attached, to be carried by accompanying ministers Chief Justice and Royal Uncle-in-law Sho Ryuyoku, Purple-Gold Grand Master Tei Junsoku, and others, for presentation. I earnestly request an imperial decree commanding the envoys to accept these gifts. Unable to contain my utmost anxiety and sincerity, I respectfully submit this memorial for Your Majesty's consideration.

The Ministry of Rites respectfully submits: Regarding the matter of the investiture ceremony having been completed and the earnest request to follow old precedents in showing appreciation to the envoys, we ministers have deliberated and concluded: Ryukyu Kingdom King Sho Kei memorializes:

The imperially appointed principal envoy Hanlin Academy Reviewer Hai Bao and vice envoy Hanlin Academy Compiler Xu Baoguang came to inspect our humble kingdom and invested this subject Kei as king. During banquets and receptions, we offered gold in place of goods. The envoys repeatedly declined, going back and forth several times, firmly upholding righteousness and resolutely refusing to accept. However, this humble subject, in trying to reciprocate kindness and repay merit, could not demonstrate even one ten-thousandth of what was due. I respectfully present two packets of banquet gold, totaling 192 taels, with detailed records, to be carried by accompanying minister Chief Justice and Royal Uncle-in-law Sho Ryuyoku and others for presentation, earnestly requesting an imperial decree granting acceptance.

Upon investigation, in the 23rd year of Kangxi, when envoys Hanlin Academy Reviewer Wang Ji and others conducted the investiture of the Ryukyu Kingdom king, they did not accept the banquet gold offered. The kingdom's king submitted a memorial request, which this Ministry deliberated and reviewed, still not permitting their acceptance. We submit this detailed report respectfully.

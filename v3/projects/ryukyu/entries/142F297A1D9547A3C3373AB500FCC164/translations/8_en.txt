[those envoys]. Now examining the historical records, we use the year of dispatching envoys as the standard. For missions since Hongwu that were not carried out through investiture ceremonies, the names cannot be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we do not list them together. Investiture envoys were customarily filled by Bureau of Receptions officials. During the Zhengtong period of Ming, they began using Secretariat Drafter-Advisors for this purpose. Both principal and vice envoys continued this practice. Later this was never changed. The use of Hanlin Academy members and Secretariat Drafter-Scribes began with the previous mission. That both envoys are court historians is unique to this mission alone.

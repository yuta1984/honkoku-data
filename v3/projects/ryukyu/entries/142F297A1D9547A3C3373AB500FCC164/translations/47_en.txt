[The imperial edicts] were proclaimed, and I, your vassal Kei, was invested as Chuzan King. I had the honor of receiving imperial gifts of python robes and other items, and my consort received colorful silk and other goods. I, your vassal Kei, led all officials in prostrating, dancing, and kowtowing in gratitude. Additionally, I petitioned the Imperial Envoys to allow the imperial edicts to remain as treasures to be passed down through the kingdom. The Imperial Envoys examined the scroll cases from the previous investiture and graciously permitted them to remain with me, to be treasured together with the new ones. I humbly reflect that the Sacred Dynasty extends special care in governing with gentle rule, like the encompassing heaven and earth. How can we vassals not be overwhelmed with gratitude? For this reason, I am specially dispatching retainer ministers: Chief Legal Officer and Royal Uncle-in-law Sho Ryuyoku, Purple-Gold Grandee Tei Junsoku, Envoy Yo Tensuke, Interpreter Sai Bunka, Deputy Interpreters Tei Genryo and Sai Yu, and others, bearing memorial documents and local tribute goods to proceed to the capital to humbly express gratitude for Imperial Grace. I humbly hope that Your Imperial Benevolence will deign to observe our sincere devotion. I, your vassal Kei, am overwhelmed with anxious reverence and respectfully present this memorial to be heard.

Tribute Goods:
Two golden cranes (with complete silver bases), One suit of armor (complete with arm and leg guards), Two swords with golden hilts and scabbards

There is no distinction between inner and outer territories - all receive pacification and comfort. Regarding all tributary offerings, We do not forget to show care and compassion. When there is merit, it must be rewarded; even if distant, none are overlooked. This is how We demonstrate embracing gentleness and illuminate the grand ceremonies. You, Shō Eki, heir to the Ryukyu Kingdom throne, inherited from your predecessor and received the throne, continuing his aspirations and rendering loyal service. For generations showing distinguished service, serving the realm while turning toward the center. Generation after generation maintaining court attendance, sailing across the vast seas to return in sincerity. However, your tenure in office lasted only three years, and the hereditary investiture was interrupted for two generations. Looking with favor upon the tributary state, We expected you to receive many blessings and strive to establish good governance. How could We have anticipated that longevity would be difficult to attain, and that news of death would be reported from afar? Special commendation and compassion are hereby declared. Though the imperial mandate did not reach you while living, the glorious favor is truly abundant after death. Therefore We bestow sacrificial offerings and dispatch a special envoy. Alas! The jade册travels far, hopefully to comfort the aspirations of the future king. The imperial missive extends its grace, truly illuminating Our sincere feelings for governing distant lands. We establish sacrificial animals - may your spirit receive and enjoy them.

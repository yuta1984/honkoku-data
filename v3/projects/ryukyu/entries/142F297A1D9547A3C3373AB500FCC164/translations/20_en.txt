It is recorded:
In the fifty-eighth year of the Kangxi era, in the cyclical year of ji-hai, in the sixth month with the first day being ren-yin, on the sacrificial day of ding-mao.
The Emperor dispatched Chief Envoy Hai Bao, Hanlin Academy Reviewer, and Deputy Envoy Xu Baoguang, Hanlin Academy Compiler, to invest the Kingdom of Ryukyu.

Imperial sacrifice to the spirit of the late Ryukyu Kingdom Chūzan King Shō Tei: "I, the Emperor, pacify and comfort all nations, treating inner and outer realms as one body. Even those in the remote barbarian territories all receive profound imperial grace. How much more so when loyal service was already sincere during life - such imperial favor and compassion becomes even more abundant after death. Reflecting upon your great achievements, it is fitting to bestow imperial radiance. You, Shō Tei, King of Chūzan of the Ryukyu Kingdom, solemnly upheld court regulations and greatly promoted the hereditary line. Holding imperial authority from the heavenly court, you calmed the whale waves and made the waters still. Serving the imperial calendar in the great court, the winds cleared the island realm. Respectful and reverent without negligence, imperial favor was early bestowed from the nine-fold palace, and your loyal devotion increased further. Time was about to span three decades, and we thought your longevity had not yet reached its end. How could we have foreseen hearing of your distant passing? We are deeply moved to grief and specially confer this sacrificial honor. Alas! You served as a screen and support in the distant realm, maintaining the integrity of a minister from beginning to end. Receiving supreme honor in the underworld, this is a brilliant imperial commendation. We offer fragrant sacrifice - may your spirit receive and enjoy it."

[The memorial continues:] You have magnificently enhanced the regulations based on the old system. Making martial virtue the weft is precisely making literary accomplishment the warp. Receiving your commands with increased reverence, I humble myself and strive ever more diligently. Respectfully reflecting that His Imperial Majesty:

Your Way surpasses that of Yao and Shun,
Your Virtue exceeds that of Tang and King Wen,
Ruling over the six directions while reigning in repose, in teaching benevolence You necessarily first teach filial piety.
Opening the nine-fold palace to establish ritual propriety, You serve as both ruler and teacher.

Your vassal Kei has for generations guarded the feudal borders and served the tributary duties through the ages. Bearing the distant bestowal of the dragon insignia, Shark Island generates radiance. Receiving the pursuing praise of the phoenix edict, the red pillars gain luster. Facing the Imperial Envoys with nine prostrations, gazing toward the elephant towers with three acclamations. I respectfully dispatch attending vassals Kō Ryūyoku, Tei Junsoku and others, reverently carrying local products to modestly express my humble offerings. Humbly praying that:

The celestial movement never ceases,
Imperial benevolence grows ever more sublime,
Unifying the royal assemblies to expand the realm, those who unite in carriage and script number one thousand eight hundred nations,
Divining the celestial timing to respond to the cosmic rhythm, verifying auspicious signs in the thirty-six winds,

We are about to witness the literary qilin offering auspicious omens and the colorful phoenix coming in ceremonial procession. Your vassal Kei cannot adequately bear the burden of reverent admiration...

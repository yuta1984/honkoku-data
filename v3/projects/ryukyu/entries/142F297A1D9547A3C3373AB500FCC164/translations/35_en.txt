East of the envoy's residence, in front of the Lower Tianfei Temple, an artificial mountain was constructed within a pond. Paper was cut to make white cranes. A large pine tree was cut and planted upright in the ground above the pond. On top, another white crane was also made, appearing as if they were flying, calling, and facing each other. Around the perimeter, artificial mountains were made with paper bark, and dozens of varieties of flowers and plants were arranged to surround it. In the center, an old man and two deer were made, appearing as if calling out birthday wishes to the mountain. This was set up by the people of Naha.

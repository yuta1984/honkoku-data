The King of Chuzan Arrives at the Hall with Ceremonial Guard

Twenty-sixth day of the seventh month.
The investiture ceremony was completed, and the great-great-grandson of Chuzan, Sho Kei, first took the title of King of Chuzan, choosing an auspicious day to announce this to the ancestral shrine.

Second day of the eighth month. Having finished receiving congratulations from the subjects and people of all islands in the kingdom, on the ninth day the King of Chuzan personally visited the Chinese Imperial Envoys' Hall to express gratitude for the investiture. He arranged an elaborate ceremonial guard, assembled his officials, completed the ritual, and returned. When he first departed from the palace gate, he rode in a palanquin carried by sixteen men. After passing Chouko Bridge and reaching the south of the Confucian temple, he briefly stopped at a separate building to change clothes and reduced the palanquin bearers to half their number before finally arriving at the Imperial Envoys' Hall. On his return to the separate building, he again changed clothes, and the ceremonial procession returned to the palace as before. What I observe now differs slightly from what was recorded by the previous envoy Wang Ji. I record it briefly below.

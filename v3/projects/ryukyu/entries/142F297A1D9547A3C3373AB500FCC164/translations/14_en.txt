established by imperial envoys Xia Ziyang and Wang Shizhen in the 34th year of Wanli. Both sides are entirely civilian houses. Many of the country's official documents are stored here. There is one bell frame with an inscription that reads: "King of Ryukyu Kingdom, Great Hereditary Lord, born in the year of Gengyin. At this time, manifesting the body of a Dharma King and measuring the great compassionate vow-sea, newly casting this great bell to donate to the Lower Tianfei Temple of this province. Above, praying for the precious throne of ten thousand years; below, saving all living beings of the three realms. Humbly commanding Prime Minister An Qian to compose this inscription. The inscription says: The magnificent bell is cast and completed, hung in the jeweled grove. Breaking through confused dreams, sincerely praying to the heavenly heart.

The center serves as Tianfei's deity hall, the right bay serves as Guandi's deity hall, and the left serves as monks' quarters. Below the steps is one bell. To the left of the main gate is a deity hall that faces upward to worship the Dragon God.

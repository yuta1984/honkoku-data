Inside the gates is a front hall of three bays, displaying a plaque with the two characters "Sùróng" (Solemn Appearance). This is where banquets are held to receive guests after the completion of sacrificial rites. Proceeding further, there is a ceremonial pathway (yōngdào), with eastern and western halls of three bays each. Below the steps, iron trees grow luxuriantly in clusters on both sides. The main temple has seven bays. Above the hall pillars are plaques: the former envoy Zhang Xueli inscribed "Rivers and Mountains Endure" (Héshān Dàilì), and Wang Ji inscribed "Eternal Contemplation of Achievement" (Yǒngguān Juéchéng). Both plaques remain. {{Note: We ministers also wrote the four characters "Generations of Loyal Devotion" (Shìdū Zhōngzhēn) and hung it next to them.}} On the west side of the hall is a spirit kitchen of two bays, and the east side serves as a Buddhist hall with six bays front and back, with three side bays serving as monks' quarters.

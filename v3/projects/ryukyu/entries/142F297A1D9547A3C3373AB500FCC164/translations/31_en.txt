[Minister] Baoguang notes that in the investiture edict of the first year of Kangxi, it states: "Dispatch officials to present the edict and seal, investing him as King of Chuzan of Ryukyu Kingdom." Therefore, the seal inscription should seemingly read "Seal of the King of Chuzan of Ryukyu Kingdom" to correspond with the edict text. However, upon examination, in the 16th year of Hongwu of the former Ming, they first bestowed upon King Satto a gold-plated silver seal. In the 18th year, they also bestowed upon the King of Nanzan and King of Hokuzan each a gold-plated silver seal with camel-shaped knob. At this time the country was divided into three. Satto possessed only Chuzan. Therefore he should rightfully be called King of Chuzan. Now Ryukyu has already unified Nanzan and Hokuzan into one for over three hundred years. Yet the country still retains the title of Chuzan, one corner [of the original three kingdoms]. This presumably follows the old precedent of previous investiture documents. There is doubt whether this demonstrates a lack of breadth. Judging by righteousness, for matters such as bestowing seals, it would be proper to simply call him "King of Ryukyu Kingdom."

ornaments. They wear five-colored robes, with five-colored floral cords around their necks, hanging long down below their knees. When they take the stage, the musicians sing, they remove the floral cords, cross their hands, stamp their feet and keep rhythm as before. This is called the second round, the floral cord dance.

Next there are three small children, about ten years old or so, wearing pearls and jade flowers covering their heads, dressed in palace skirts and five-colored brocade half-sleeves. Each carries a small flower basket on their shoulders. They take the stage and stand in a triangle formation. The musicians sing, and they stamp and keep rhythm as before. This is called the third round, the basket dance. Next, four young children wear short red-green five-colored palace robes, with long skirts interwoven with colorful silk trailing on the ground. They sway and take the stage, facing the musicians in a seated position. The musicians give each of them four pieces of small bamboo clappers. They rise to dance and keep rhythm, clapping their hands in response. This is called the fourth round, the clapper dance.

Next there are six warriors. They wear short robes with large sleeves in alternating black and white geometric patterns, with golden bands binding their foreheads in the style of flat-topped monk's caps. They hold white staffs, striking them together in response to the rhythm. This is called the fifth round, the martial dance. There are also two small children in five-colored robes, holding golden balls. The balls have small golden bells and long red tasseled cords attached on all four sides. They dance left and right, leading two blue lions onto the stage, spinning and leaping. This is called the sixth round, the ball dance.

When one seating ends, they change seats. Again three small children in palace costume take the stage, sitting facing the musicians. The musicians give them two small golden flower-staffs. The length does not reach about one chi, with red flowers attached to both ends. They strike them together in response to the rhythm. This is called the seventh round, the staff dance. Next there are four small children. They change into palace robes and take the stage, holding flower poles in their hands. About three chi long, one pole each. They dance in response to the rhythm. This is called the eighth round, the pole dance.

By this time it was already approaching dusk. They removed the curtains and set up dozens of firework stands in the courtyard. They also had several people wear fire caps on their heads and ride mock horses, with smoke and firecrackers bursting simultaneously from head to tail, galloping around the courtyard for entertainment. When the banquet ended and they exited the castle, thousands of torches about two zhang long lined both sides of the road.

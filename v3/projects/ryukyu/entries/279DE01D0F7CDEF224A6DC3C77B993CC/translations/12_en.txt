During the time of Lord Tsunayoshi as Shogun

1. On the 10th day of the 4th month of Tenna 2 (1682), Lord Hotta Izunokami sent word: "There is official business from the castle, so you should ascend to the castle immediately." I then proceeded there. Tomorrow the Ryukyu people will offer their respects and present one horse as tribute. Bunkurō and Bunemon will appear and lead the horse before His Presence for inspection. When offering respects, the metsuke (inspectors) will give signals as instructed. It is most proper to lead the horse out accordingly. The horse should be received in the area near the partition. Horse handlers and attendants should be stationed there to receive it, as instructed.

1. The next day, the 11th, at the hour of the Dragon (7-9 AM), two horse handlers, three attendants, and two grooms were summoned, and Bunkurō and Bunemon proceeded to the castle. The Ryukyu people ascended to the castle at the late hour of the Snake (around 11 AM). The horse was received by the aforementioned men in front of the Hyakunin-gumi guard post. It was placed inside Hiraji-gomon in front of the main entrance. Upon signal from the metsuke, the horse was led and positioned in front of the stage area. During the appearance ceremony, Bunkurō and Bunemon led the horse, the horse handler prostrated behind the horse, and when the Ryukyu people's respects were completed and they remained present, the horse was withdrawn and placed aside.

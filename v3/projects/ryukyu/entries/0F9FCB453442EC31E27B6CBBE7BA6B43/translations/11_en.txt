The official system consists of nine ranks each of regular (正) and subordinate (従) grades. Regular first rank is Prince (Hāansu), subordinate first rank is Aji (Ansu), regular second rank is Sanshikan Oyakata (Woyakata), subordinate second rank is Oyakata. Third through seventh ranks are Pēchin (Bākishi), regular and subordinate eighth ranks are Satonoshi (Satonoshi), and regular and subordinate ninth ranks are Chikudun (Jikutoshi).

Prince is an official title. Whether of the same surname as the king or different surname, all those who receive territorial grants are called "某 Prince." Even the king's brothers, if they have not yet received investiture, cannot be called Prince.

Aji refers to district lords. Baikume and Baikin are equivalent to Pēchin.

The royal palace is built as a castle on a mountain, each side measuring one ri, with stones stacked as the foundation and surrounded by flowing water. The main hall is located at the mountain peak, the palace building has two stories with eight bays running north-south, facing west, with the upper level for enshrining gods, the middle as an audience hall, and the lower level for sitting and standing with retainers. Generally, the main hall roughly follows Chinese systems, but for the private quarters, they all follow the customs of this realm (Japan). The royal family also all follow our customs.

Both men and women expose their hair. Men cut their hair and tie topknots on the right side. The national history refers to this as "cut hair and grass skirts," and the right topknot is called Katakashira (single head). According to tradition, people of ancient times all wore horns, but once a god broke off its left horn, and later this was imitated. Women have jet-black hair like clouds, tied into high topknots, with hairpins bearing no decoration, and tattoo their hands with ink in various floral patterns (commonly called Haritsuki - needle piercing).

The entire populace reveres gods, and the gods are indeed spiritual. These gods are called Kinmamon, and the women possessed by gods, called Kimi, number thirty-three, all daughters of chieftains. Their leader is called Kikufu-gimi, and the remaining shrine maidens throughout the land number in the hundreds and thousands. When gods descend at appointed times, all drum, dance, and sing to please the gods. One sings and hundreds respond in harmony, their voices plaintive and graceful.

There are also sacred serpents, which the people fear like gods.

The mountains and valleys of the various islands are rugged, with few plains and fields. The soil is sandy, gravelly, and infertile, making farming extremely difficult. The climate is always warm and grain ripens early, but abundant harvests are not seen. Generally, Chūzan and Hokuzan have many paddy fields suitable for glutinous rice cultivation. The Nanzan region has dry fields suitable for beans and similar crops.

Currently, the tax revenue of that country is: Chūzan grain rice 71,787 koku, Hokuzan 32,828.7 koku, Nanzan 19,096.8 koku and some remainder. Other taxes and levies are proportional to this.

Their products include horse conch shells, sea lettuce, ramie cloth, cowhide, ebony, sulfur, and whetstones, which serve as tribute items. Grains include rice, wheat, and beans; vegetables include melons, eggplant, ginger, garlic, onions, leeks, and the like - all are present. There are also sweet potatoes that can substitute for grain, and many edible seaweeds. Fruits include longan and banana.

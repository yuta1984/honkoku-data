It states that Penghu Island is west of the country, five days by water travel. Upon examination, Penghu is close to Taiwan and Quanzhou, and is not an island belonging to Ryukyu. The Ryukyu map authored by Zheng Ziruo-zeng of Kunshan perpetuates this error. Moreover, it positions mountains such as Pengjia Mountain, Diaoyu Islet, Flower Vase Islet, Jilong, and Little Ryukyu—which are used as navigation markers and are actually 2,000-3,000 li distant from Ryukyu—all in the vicinity of Kome Mountain and Naha Port. The errors are most egregious. Taiping Mountain is located far to the south of the country, 2,000 li away, yet Zheng's map relocates it to the summit of Chuzan, in front of Kankai Gate, depicting it as a small mountain. This is also most incorrect.

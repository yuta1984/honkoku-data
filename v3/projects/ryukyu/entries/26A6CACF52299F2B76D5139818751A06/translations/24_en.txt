The mountains, temples, and places visited in Chuzan were only several locations in Shuri and Naha, briefly recorded as follows:

[Rinkai Temple] Located within the north battery's long embankment. It serves as a place for the king's prayers and offerings. The gate faces east. The Buddha hall faces south, with three bays facing east. There is a one-bay wooden pavilion. Stone walls surround it on all sides. The tide reaches the base of the walls. The monk's name is Seiman. The temple's former name was Teikai. There is a plaque with calligraphy reading "Rinkai Temple" by the previous envoy Wang Ji. There is a bell cast in the third year of Tianshun.

[Okuyama] [Ryuto Temple] Located on a small earthen hill in the water west of the battery. When the tide comes in, it spreads for dozens of ri; when the tide recedes, it becomes flat sand and shallow water, unsuitable for boats. The mountain was originally a snake den. The monk Shinkai first developed it. The snakes collectively crossed the water and departed. He built an embankment to block the tide, drew spring water, and planted pines. He constructed five to six bay buildings and built two small pavilions in the pond in front. Hibiscus, phoenix tail plants, and other vegetation are planted throughout. It is quite suitable for rest and enjoyment. To the east of the mountain is a small pointed hill called [Tsurugashira Mountain]. When the tide reaches the lakes of Itashiki and Uhira, with fishing boats in the evening light, it becomes the foremost scenic spot near Naha.

[Tsuji Mountain] Located west of Rinkai Temple, facing the harbor. The character "tsuji" has two pronunciations for one character. The local people read it as "Tushi Mountain." Wang Ji's record mistakenly records it as "Seishi Mountain." The small rocky hill runs along the sea, with tombs below.

[Naminoue] Located northeast of Tsuji Mountain. Also called Stone Bamboo Shoot Cliff. Stone moss grows in the sea below the mountain. Along the coast there are many pumice stones, with cavities, exquisite and white in color. Stone walls surround the mountaintop on all sides. From behind the walls one can view the sea. Within the walls, wooden pavilions stand separately in three bays. It is locked and has no monks. Below there is a flat hall of three bays. In the coastal area northeast of Naminoue, there is a mountain called [Yukizaki]. Below there is a cave called Yukizaki. To the northeast there is a small

[Komi] is located west of Yaeyama. It is large compared to other islands.
【Marginal note: "Takemue, possibly Taketomi"】
[Taketomi] is translated as Takemue. It is located west of Yaeyama, east of Komi.
[Kuroshima] is translated as Kuro Island. It is located slightly north of the west of Yaeyama.
[Arakusuku] is translated as Arakusuku (New Castle). It is located west of Yaeyama.
[Hateruma] is translated as Hateruma. It is located at the far northwest of Yaeyama.
　　The above eight islands all belong to Yaeyama. The people of the country call all of these "Yaeyama." This is the extreme southwestern territorial boundary of Ryukyu.
　　Regarding the thirty-six islands, they do not appear in previous records. Only Zhang Xueli's record states that thirty-six surnames were bestowed and thirty-six islands were civilized. As for the island names and products, it has not yet reached that level of detail. Now, following the king's wishes, I requested that a map be shown. The king commanded Purple Gold Minister Tei Jun-soku to create a map. Its diameter was more than one zhang. The east-west-north-south directions were roughly determined. However, it only noted the local names of the thirty-six islands. Regarding the distances of water routes, the fertility or barrenness of local products, and the established systems by which officials receive their duties—all of these lack detail. Baoguang consulted widely and collected extensively, connecting details systematically, and also worked with scholars of Chuzan to repeatedly refine the information. Now, although we can roughly see the outline, I fear there are still many errors and omissions. Adding detail and careful verification should await future gentlemen.
　　Minister Baoguang notes that the traditional accounts of islands and islets contain very many errors. Previous envoys' records have already corrected many of these. The Ming Yitongzhi states that Yuanbi Islet is west of the country, one day by water travel, and Gaohua Islet (alternatively written as Ying) is west of the country, three days by water travel. Now, when examining these two islets, neither exists. Moreover,

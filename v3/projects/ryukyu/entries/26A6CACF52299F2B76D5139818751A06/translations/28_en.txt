《Inscription text: The text states: Great Ryukyu is a country of islands in the southeastern sea. Since ancient times it did not communicate with China. At the beginning of the previous dynasty, they once sent envoys to summon them, but they did not come. Reflecting that our Taizu Emperor, responding to Heaven's mandate and opening the realm, unified the world. Within and beyond the seas, none failed to submit as vassals. At that time [Ryukyu] took the lead in paying tribute, distinctly receiving imperial favor, different from other states. In the early Yongle period, they first received investiture and were enfeoffed as a royal domain. For over a hundred years since, they have maintained tribute with increasing care. In the autumn of Hongzhi dingsi year, the state minister Cheng Lian, secretary Liang Neng, and interpreter Chen Yi, bearing the command of the present King Shoshin, paid court tribute to the capital. Having completed their mission, they passed through Sanzan and called upon Hanlin Bachelor Xu Tianxi, saying: In Qiuyang there is a domain, with a long dynastic history. The present king has great virtue, thinking of gathering and glorifying [his realm], always following old customs. We request that sons of court ministers be admitted to the Imperial Academy, to hear once of the civilizing influence of benevolence, righteousness, ritual and music of the Celestial Court, thereby strengthening the national polity. Let us briefly describe the situation: The country has writings for selecting the old ways. The king honors the request for orthodox calendar. Therefore they also use the methods of the Datong calendar. Previous generations lived in deep seclusion and firm defense, thereby causing division among their subjects. The king only promotes sincerity, personally tours the realm, travels to remote places, and constantly inspects [his domain]}}

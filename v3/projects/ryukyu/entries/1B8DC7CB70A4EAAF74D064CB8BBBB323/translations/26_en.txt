"Yangamiko" Mountain Spirit {{Marginal note: God of the mountains. Uses two child attendants | Called Jirou-ko and Gorou-ko}}
"Kinmanmon" Lord of All Things {{Marginal note: Guardian deity of the country since the creation of heaven and earth}}

〇Kinmanmon has both yin and yang aspects. That which descends from heaven is called "Kiraikanai no Kinmanmon," and that which rises from the sea is called "Ohotsuukeraku no Kinmanmon."

〇There are thirty-three priestesses who serve this god, all from royal lineage. The queen consort is also one of them. This is the same as in Japan, where imperial princesses are appointed to serve as Saiguu (Ise shrine priestesses).

"Shunten Taijingu" Located in Shuri, it enshrines Chinzei Hachiro Tametomo.

〇In addition to this, there are the sacred groves (ogamibayashi) of Tamagusuku, Tomigusuku, Kitadani, and Takamine. "Ogamibayashi" refers to sacred forests of gods, and the local tutelary shrines in villages are called by the same name. There are also many Tenmangu shrines. Because they are called Tenjin, many people mistakenly think of them as Sun-Ten deities and do not understand that they are actually Kanjin (Sugawara no Michizane). This is said to be because there are many such shrines due to the faith of Tametomo and King Shunten.

〇When Kinmanmon becomes angry, the people practice purification and perform rituals called "udeori" and "tsumaori" to worship and appease the deity.

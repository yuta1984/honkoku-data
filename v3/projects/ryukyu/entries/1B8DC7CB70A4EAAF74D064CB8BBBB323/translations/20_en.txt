The patterns include beautiful dyed colors, and some are made of thin fabric embroidered with various grasses and flowers using five-colored threads, gold thread, etc. Women sometimes hang many beads long from their waists. Also, even in winter, since it is a country that does not know cold like our summer, they do not put cotton padding in their clothes. Men's clothing is generally similar to that of China.

Country rough
In this world of samsara
Something unknown, kanna
Good in wind and sun

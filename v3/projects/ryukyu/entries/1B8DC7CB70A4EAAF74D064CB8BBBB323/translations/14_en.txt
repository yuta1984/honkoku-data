○ Brief Genealogy of the Kings of Ryukyu Kingdom

At the time of the creation of heaven and earth, one man and one woman were born through spontaneous generation (spontaneous generation means being born without parents). The male deity's surname was Kanshi-shi and his name was Katsurato, whom the local people call Karounengun. The female deity was called Tobato. (In another book, the husband is called "Shinerikyu" and the wife "Amamikyu")

Katsurato and Tobato became husband and wife. However, their island was small and drifting on the waves. Therefore, they planted a tree called "Tashika" that had grown, gradually forming it into the shape of a mountain, and planted grass called "Shikyu."

They also planted a tree called "Atan" to form the shape of the country. Since there was no fire here, they begged for and obtained fire from the Dragon King at the bottom of the sea, and thus the Five Elements were already accomplished. The local people later called these two yin-yang deities "Amamiku." Eventually the two deities united and gave birth to three sons and two daughters.

First son: Tenson-shi - This is the beginning of the royal line
Second: Urukan (male) - This becomes the beginning of the Aji (local lords)
Third: Merukan (male) - This becomes the beginning of the common people

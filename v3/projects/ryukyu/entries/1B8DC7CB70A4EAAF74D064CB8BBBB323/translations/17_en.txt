○Customs

○Originally, this country was a land of barbarians where neither etiquette nor moral principles were properly established. However, in the first year of Eiman of Emperor Nijo (1165), Chinzei Hachiro Minamoto no Tametomo was exiled to an island in Izu Province. He crossed from Oshima to Ryukyu, suppressed rebellions, brought peace to the people, taught the Way of the Five Constants, and instructed them in civil and military laws. From this time, Japanese customs were adopted. Later, for a time, they flattered the Ming Dynasty and completely imitated Chinese customs in their caps and robes, clothing, residences, and implements. Originally, since their country is very small and cannot be self-sufficient, they receive investiture from China while also submitting to Japan. Therefore, now they have changed their barbarian customs, and the customs of both countries (Japan and China) are mixed in equal measure.

Thus, in naming things and in ordinary language, Chinese readings and Japanese readings are mixed together. Among these, some use Tang pronunciations, and there are also ancient Ryukyuan words. However, it should be understood that in most cases, their dress and caps follow the Qing Dynasty, while their language imitates Japan.

Later it was changed to the current characters for Ryukyu 《The Chuzan Denshin-roku records that the characters were changed to the present ones during the Hongwu era of the Ming, but this is an error—it happened before that time》○ In ancient times, our country called Ryukyu "Uruma no Kuni" (Country of Uruma).

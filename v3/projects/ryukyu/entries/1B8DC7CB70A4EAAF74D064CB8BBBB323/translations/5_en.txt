　　　　Shirahata, Satsuma Province　　　　　　　Written by Beizanshi

Now, the Kingdom of Ryukyu is located to the south of Satsuma Province, approximately 840 ri by sea route 《At sea, six chō constitute one ri. When using the land measurement of thirty-six chō to one ri, it would be 1,140 ri. The Wakan Sansai Zue's record of 380 ri at sea is an error》. The country extends 59 ri and more from north to south, while east to west it is barely 10 ri 《using the land measurement of thirty-six chō to one ri》.

This land is located 26 degrees, 2 minutes, and 3 rin north of the equator. Therefore, its warm climate surpasses that of other countries 《In the first month, peach and cherry blossoms bloom, and even in winter there is no need to put cotton padding in clothing, and mosquitoes do not disappear》.

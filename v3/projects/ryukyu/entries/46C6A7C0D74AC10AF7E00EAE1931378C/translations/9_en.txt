When composing this work upon returning home, I considered that what is obtained through hearsay is not as true as what one sees with one's own eyes. The most honored official in that country is called the Purple Gold Doctor (Shijin Daifu), and the person who held this position at that time was precisely the one whose children and younger relatives among the attendant ministers had been permitted to enter school for study when Master Zhouci served as envoy on his previous mission. His literary expressions were admirable, and conversing with him was engaging and meaningful. Everything described in this current work was obtained from his words and verified against historical records through testimony from other ministers, making it reliable and well-founded. How could works like Ji Han's "Flora of the South" or Fan Chengda's "Records of Guilin and the Sea" compare to this? This is a book that anyone who composes poems on imperial missions should possess.

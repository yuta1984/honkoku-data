Navigation Routes

Ryukyu is located in the sea and originally corresponds east-west with the topography of Zhejiang and Fujian. However, the area between them is flat with no mountains. When ships navigate at sea, they rely entirely on mountains as landmarks. When traveling from Fuzhou to Ryukyu, one exits through Wuhu Gate and must aim for mountains such as Jilong and Pengjia. Since all these mountains are偏located to the south, at summer solstice one rides the southwest wind, using compass directions like chen and xun, making a detour southward and gradually turning due east. When returning from Ryukyu to Fuzhou, one departs from Gumi Mountain and must aim for Nanqi Mountain near Wenzhou. Since the mountain is located to the northwest, at winter solstice one rides the northeast wind, using compass directions like qian and xu, making a detour northward and gradually turning due west. Although the topography of both places corresponds east-west, one cannot travel directly back and forth using pure mao-you compass directions because navigation relies on mountains as landmarks, and moreover, sailing vessels must prize gaining the windward advantage.

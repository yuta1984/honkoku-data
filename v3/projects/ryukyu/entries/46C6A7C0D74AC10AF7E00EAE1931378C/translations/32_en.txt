30th day, Ding-Mao, riding the northeast wind and tide, the three ships proceeded in wild goose formation into Wuhu Gate. At midday reached Yishan Academy.

Performed ritual proclamation to the sea god. Navigation at sea lasted approximately fourteen days and nights.

[Marginal note: Minister] Baoguang observes that among investiture missions with records, beginning with Chen Kan in the Jiajing period of the former Ming until Wang Ji and others in the twenty-first year of Kangxi, there were approximately seven occasions. When investiture ships returned to Fujian, the dangers of broken masts and drifting rudders reached their extreme, and each time I reviewed these accounts my heart was moved. Now receiving His Imperial Majesty's divine authority, the sea gods showed compliance, and during this mission lasting over a year we fortunately avoided the dangers of winter storms. During half a month of drifting, there were very few waves that threatened the ship. Though we had no spare masts or rudders, we ultimately avoided damage. When occasional storms arose, they immediately stopped upon prayer. Several hundred people above and below deck traveled and returned safely, far surpassing previous times. We raise our hands in celebration and gratitude, all bearing His Imperial Grace. As for seasickness, vomiting, and minor hardships - these are common to sea vessels, what is there to mention?

《Marginal note: According to one account, the goddess was born in the eighth year of Zhezong's Yuanyou era, and according to another account, she was born in the year jia-shen. However, if the goddess ascended to heaven on the ninth day of the ninth month in the fourth year of Emperor Taizong's Yongxi era at the age of twenty-eight, then the account of her birth in the first year of Jianlong would be correct. She did not cry even after a full month from birth, so she was named Mo (Silent)》

Thereafter, she continued to manifest divine efficacy, appearing in dreams or showing divine lights, protecting countless ships at sea. The local people together worshipped her. In the fifth year of Xuanhe under Song Emperor Huizong, when Vice Director of the Imperial Secretariat Lu Yundi was sent as an envoy to Goryeo, seven of his eight ships were wrecked, but only Yundi's ship saw the goddess sitting on the mast in red robes and thus returned safely. This was reported to the court, which bestowed the temple plaque "Shunji" (Favorable Crossing).

In the twenty-sixth year of Shaoxing under Emperor Gaozong, she was first enfeoffed as Lady Linghui (Spiritually Benevolent) and granted the temple plaque "Lingying" (Divine Response). In the thirtieth year, when sea pirates reached Jiangkou, the goddess appeared in the wind and waves, causing the pirates to scatter and be captured. Quanzhou reported this matter and she was enfeoffed as Lady Linghui Zhaoying (Spiritually Benevolent and Manifestly Responsive).

In the second year of Qiandao under Emperor Xiaozong, when an epidemic struck Xinghua, the goddess descended to White Lake and obtained a sweet spring about ten feet from the tide; those who drank from it were immediately cured. When sea pirates came again, she caused them to lose their way in fog and they were captured at the temple entrance. She was enfeoffed as Lady Linghui Zhaoying Chongfu (Spiritually Benevolent, Manifestly Responsive, and Reverent of Fortune). In the eleventh year of Chunxi, she assisted Patrol Inspector Jiang Teli in capturing bandits from Wenzhou and Taizhou, and was enfeoffed as Lady Linghui Zhaoying Chongfu Shanli (Spiritually Benevolent, Manifestly Responsive, Reverent of Fortune, and Beneficent).

《Marginal note: Wang's record has "Lady Lingci Zhaoying Chongshan Fuli," but Lingci is a temple designation. All enfeoffments should be based on the original beginning title of Linghui, so it should read "Linghui Chongfu" with the two characters "Shanli" added after the previous enfeoffment. These two characters mean "beneficial to good people." The above enfeoffments as Lady total four times》

In the third year of Shaoxi under Emperor Guangzong, she was specially enfeoffed as Imperial Consort Linghui for her merit in relieving epidemic and drought. In the fourth year of Qingyuan under Emperor Ningzong, she was enfeoffed as Imperial Consort Linghui Zhushun (Spiritually Benevolent and Assisting Compliance) for relieving floods. In the first year of Jiading, she assisted in quelling the Daxi bandits with fog to help capture the criminals. When the Jin invaded Huaidian and fought at Huaye Town, the goddess assisted in battle, and in the battle of Zijin Mountain, the divine image appeared again for another victory. After three battles, the siege of Hefei was finally lifted. She was enfeoffed as Imperial Consort Linghui Zhushun Xianwei (Spiritually Benevolent, Assisting Compliance, and Manifestly Protective). In the tenth year of Jiading, she relieved drought and captured sea pirates, receiving the additional title of Imperial Consort Linghui Zhushun Xianwei Yinglie (Spiritually Benevolent, Assisting Compliance, Manifestly Protective, and Heroically Fierce). In the third year of Jiaxi, when the tide at Qiantang burst and reached [the text continues]

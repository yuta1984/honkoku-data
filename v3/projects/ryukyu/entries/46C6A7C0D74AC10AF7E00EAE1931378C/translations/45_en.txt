The Emperor dispatched the principal investiture envoy Hai Bao, Compiler of the Hanlin Academy, and deputy envoy Xu Baoguang, Editor of the Hanlin Academy, to perform investiture of the Ryukyu Kingdom, to offer sacrifice to

the Sea Deity, saying: The deity has manifestly displayed spiritual efficacy, secretly supporting the imperial enterprise, guiding the envoys in their swift expedition, crossing great waves with benefit, accomplishing the mission in traveling to and from this distant land without error, and successfully promoting the national prestige. This is truly due to the deity's protection. We now extend this clear report and again offer fragrant sacrifices. May the deity observe and accept this, maintaining eternal glory and merit. We respectfully announce this.

Also around this time, they established diplomatic relations with Siam (Thailand), Java, and other countries. Shō Shitatsu, son of Shō Chū, succeeded to the throne. In Bun'an 5, an envoy visited the capital (Kyoto). Shō Kinpuku, the sixth son of Hashi, succeeded to the throne. In Hōtoku 3, an envoy visited the capital and presented 1,000 kan of coins to Shogun Yoshimasa. Yoshimasa presented these to the imperial court. Thereafter, people from the country came to Hyōgo to trade, established the three-year tribute system as a permanent institution, and the Shimazu clan took charge of reception duties. When Kinpuku died, his son Shiroku and his uncle Furi fought over the throne, burned the treasury, and both died from their wounds. Kinpuku's eldest son Shō Taikyū succeeded. His son Shō Toku inherited the throne but was tyrannical. When Kikaijima rebelled, the king personally suppressed it. In Bunshō 1, an envoy visited the capital.

Later, when the people assassinated the heir apparent and sought to enthrone him, he firmly declined but could not refuse. In Bunmei 2, he finally ascended the throne. All governance was well-ordered, and the various islands submitted. His son Shō Shin succeeded. Naturally intelligent and wise, he had strategies for governance. When Yaeyama rebelled, he dispatched troops to suppress it, and consequently built a battery at Naha port. Also, under the old system, one aji was placed in each magiri, their power was heavy and there were military conflicts, but from Shō Shin's time onward, all were made to reside in Shuri, and officials were dispatched to govern remotely. Before this, the monk-envoys Sōsetsu and Sō Sokyō, whom Ōuchi Yoshioki, Hosokawa Takakuni and others had sent to Ming, greatly

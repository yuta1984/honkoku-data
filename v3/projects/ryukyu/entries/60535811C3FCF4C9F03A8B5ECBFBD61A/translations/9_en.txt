descendants of people who migrated there. A Confucian temple and school are established there. To its northeast, Tomari forms a small bay. To its northeast, Mawashi produces pottery from Tsuboya Mountain. Also in Asato Village, there is a shrine to former kings, enshrining successive dynasties from Shunten onward. On the west coast at Nakagusuku, there is an old castle, and north of it, mountains layer upon mountains.

Sannan, or what is called Shimajiri Province, is at the southern tip of the island. Though it is the narrowest of the three provinces, it appears to be well developed. It consists of twelve magiri: Ōzato, Tamagusuku, Tomigusuku, Oroku, Kanegusuku, Takamine, Sashiki, Chinen, Gushikami, Mabuni, Makabe, and Kyan, totaling 114 villages. In Tomigusuku and Takamine, there are old castles of the Sannan kings. Hachizu-dake northeast of Takamine is one of the five sacred peaks.

Sanhoku, or what is called Kunigami Province, is in the northern part of the island. It is the largest of the three provinces, with half of the entire island belonging to it. However, it appears barren. It has nine magiri: Kin, Onna, Nago, Kushi, Haneji, Imakijin, Motobu, Ōgimi, and Kunigami, with sixty-eight villages. On the east coast, Kin faces a large bay into which the Fuzau River flows. The bay is shallow with many reefs. Onna on the south coast is a place of beautiful scenery. To its southeast is Mount Onna, and to the northeast Mount Nago, both ranked among the five sacred peaks. To its northwest in Imakijin, there is an old castle of the Sanhoku kings. Its western harbor is called Niyoha Inlet, and the two islands in the western sea are called Sesoko and Mina (both belonging to Motobu magiri). Kaso-dake in Imakijin is the first of the five sacred peaks and the highest mountain on Okinawa Island. The Daiei River below the mountain flows southwest. On its northeastern shore is Unten Port, with the two islands of Oki and Yaka (belonging to Haneji magiri) in front, forming a bay. It is a good harbor second only to Naha, capable of anchoring fifty to sixty large Japanese ships. It is where ships from the northern islands and mainland Japan gather. To its east, in Shashiki Village of Haneji, iron, sulfur, and coal are produced along the coast (Kaei 6th year).

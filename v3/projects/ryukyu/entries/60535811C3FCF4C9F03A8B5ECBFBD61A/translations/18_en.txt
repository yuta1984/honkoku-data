[The region] lies directly in the path of the gū-winds and tai-winds of the East, and thus suffers greatly from their harm. Gū 【ruby reading "Ōhayate"】gets its name from rotating in all four directions without a fixed bearing. 《Bai is incorrect》 They are most common in spring and summer. They arise suddenly and cease suddenly. When they occur, black spots appear in the sky, and they arrive violently in an instant. Tai 【ruby reading "Akashima"】are most common between summer and autumn. They gradually arise and continue for days without stopping. When they occur, broken rainbows appear in the sky, extending across half the heavens, creating abnormal changes. When they appear in the north, they are most violent. When Western navigators call the storms of the China Sea "typhoon," this is probably the pronunciation of the characters tai-feng. This is what they most guard against. Also, both tai and gū initially bring rain without fail, the sea surface suddenly changes, there is much pollution, and there are signs of sea snakes floating to the surface. However, while gū-winds can still be avoided, tai-winds must not be encountered.

○ In the northwestern sea of Ryukyu, there is one great ocean current. It constantly flows from southwest to northeast. This is the source of the Kuroshio current near Hachijōjima. Generally, the spaces between the various islands have swift currents. Navigators should be cautious. 《The Chinese call this luòjiè》 Also, in the waters near Naha, the tidal rise and fall generally differs by six shaku. Every month at the full moon, Fuzhou in Qing has high tide at noon, while this area has high tide at sunset.

Geology
The quality of Okinawan soil is generally clay-like, interspersed with limestone in places. From sea level to forty or fifty jō up, it is all like this. There are many rocky reefs in the coastal waters, appearing and disappearing among the waves. The mountains are generally covered with thriving pine forests, and the cliff areas are precipitous and steep, presenting a volcanic appearance. Only the mountain peaks are somewhat barren; elsewhere, in the valleys and fields, it is moist and fertile, with vegetation flourishing everywhere. 《Should be referenced with the section on cultivation》

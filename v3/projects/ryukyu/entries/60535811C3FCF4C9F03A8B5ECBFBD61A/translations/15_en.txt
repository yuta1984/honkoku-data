They particularly love tea, so tea is the primary import from the mainland. In trade, they do not use currency but exchange goods. The climate is warm in winter and cool in summer, with all things flourishing. There are five grains, cotton, banana plants, mulberry, bamboo, palm trees, oak trees (kashi), and screw pine (adan). There are many cycads, and the natives crush and eat their roots during famines. Sweet potatoes flourish year-round and serve as the staple food for the natives. There are cattle, horses, dogs, sheep, chickens, pigs, and ducks. The mountains have many wild boars and rabbits. There are venomous snakes called habu (pit vipers) - if they bite a person, death is immediate. Marine fish are extremely abundant, and pearls are produced. Pottery is crudely manufactured. Sugar cane is also extensively cultivated, and sugar production surpasses all other islands. Approximately ten million kin are produced annually. This is what is known in the world as Oshima sugar, all transported from Satsuma to the mainland. Ocean currents nearby constantly flow northeast. ○ Kakeroma Island (also written as Katona or Kakeroma-sue) adjoins the southwest of Oshima. The island is narrow in shape and extends east-west. Circumference: fifteen ri. ○ Uke Island (also called Uru or Ukino) adjoins to the south of the above. Circumference: over four ri. ○ Yoro Island also adjoins to its west. Circumference: three and a half ri. All three islands above belong to Oshima.

Kikai Island (also written as Kikai or Kikai) lies to the east of Oshima. Circumference: six ri twenty-four chō, mountain height: eighty-seven jō. The entire island is mostly flat land, with five magiri: Shidoke, Higashi (East), Nishime (West Eye), Wan, and Aramoto. Wantomari is a port in the southwest. It produces sugar and oak trees (kashi) of the finest quality. It produces sulfur, soapstone, thunder axes, and limestone. (Some say it also produces platinum.) There are few trees on the land, so they burn horse manure as a substitute for firewood and charcoal. The islanders have dark skin. ○ Tokunoshima lies to the southwest of Oshima. Circumference: seventeen ri three chō. The island's shape resembles a conch shell. It has many mountains, with the northern mountains being the highest at two hundred jō. There are three magiri: Higashi (East), Nishime (West Eye), and Omona. Akitoku Port on the east coast is suitable for anchoring. Inokawa

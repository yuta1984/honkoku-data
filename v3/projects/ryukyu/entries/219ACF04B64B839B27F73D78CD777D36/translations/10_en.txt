The population, according to detailed records, has doubled. The area of the tributary islands has also greatly expanded. In the past, the land of Naha had stagnant sewage and brackish well water, requiring people to travel far to the eastern shore of the port for daily drinking water. Now water is channeled to irrigate the city streets, ditches are dredged, and roads are repaired. At night, lights are lit making it bright as day. Between Naha and Shuri, the detour routes were winding and the stone ridges would bite at one's heels. Now they have leveled the high and low places, crushed the cliffs, and created straight roads where carriages and horses can gallop. In the span of merely ten years, the transformation has been like this. However, this is merely the external appearance. In their administration, the balance of power and institutional arrangements do not lose their fair standards. Even in remote villages and isolated areas, schools have all been established to educate children. Through patient persuasion and guidance, they transform the ignorant into the enlightened. Even to the southern extremity of Yonaguni Island, all are encouraged in agriculture and sericulture and diligent in weaving. The reach of this civilizing influence extends far, which was not the case under the protection of the Shimazu clan.

Ōmi-no-kami received it. The aforementioned two letters were handed over to Tsugaru Tajima-no-kami at the Dokei-no-ma (Earth-measuring Chamber).

Article: The incoming letter reads as follows:
　　　　I respectfully prepare this letter and humbly present it to Your Excellency, respectfully hearing that
　　　　your country's
　　Great Lord has newly
　　　　inherited the national succession, with the four seas at peace and all auspicious signs fulfilled. How could our small domain
　　　　not also offer congratulations like those of Kafū? Now I especially dispatch my retainer Prince Misato,
　　　　presenting humble tribute goods, following our Satsuma Minor Captain Yoshitaka,
　　　　to respectfully
　　　　present
　　　congratulatory ceremonies. I humbly hope that the senior councilors will accept them. This is conveyed especially
　　to Your Honor's attention, and I cannot adequately express my utmost reverence and trepidation. With sincere respect and repeated bows, I dare not say more.
　　　　Hōei 7th year, year of the Metal Tiger, 5th month, 3rd day - Chūzan King Shō Eki
　　　　Respectfully submitted

　　　　To Lord Tsuchiya Sagami-no-kami

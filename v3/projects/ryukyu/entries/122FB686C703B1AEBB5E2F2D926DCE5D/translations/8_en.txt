The route passes through the slope between the residences of Matsudaira Hizen-no-kami and Matsudaira Aki-no-kami, from in front of the main gate of Ii Kamon-no-kami via the outer moat and Sakurada Gate, past the residences of Akimoto Tajima-no-kami and Manabe Echizen-no-kami to Wadakura Gate, past the residence of Inoue Kawachi-no-kami through the back street behind the rest station to Ōte Gate, and then ascending to the castle.

Along the route from the Shiba residence to the Kōbashi residence, two groups of御徒 (castle foot soldiers) - the Shinjō Iori group and the Tatebe Jinzaemon group - provide security. From the Kōbashi residence to Ōte, two groups of 御徒 - the Mamiya Yukie group and the Natsume Tōzaemon group (with Kaneda Sōhachirō substituting for the ailing Tōzaemon) - provide escort. Security guards from the residences along the route also come out.

Article: The envoy rides in a palanquin while attendants ride saddled horses. At the approach to Ōte Bridge, the attendants dismount and follow on foot, while the envoy does not ride on the bridge but dismounts from the palanquin before the bridge.
However, flag bearers, spear bearers, and other officials remain at the Ōte rest station.

When the envoy reaches the top of the steps at the main entrance, the ōmetsuke (senior inspectors) - Sengoku Tamba-no-kami and Orii Awaji-no-kami - come out to provide guidance. The envoy takes a seat in the lower section of the palace hall, while attendants line up in the adjacent room of the same location. The servants gather in groups in the front courtyard of the main entrance.

　　　　I respectfully prepare this letter to express my humble sentiments. Last year, Satsuma Grand Lord
　　　　Minor Captain Yoshitaka, in accordance with and following
　the intent of Your Imperial Command, permitted this humble vassal to succeed to his ancestors' duties, and our domain remains unchanged,
　　　　so how could our joy not be boundless? Now, wishing to pay respects and express gratitude for
　Your great benevolence, following Yoshitaka, I dispatch my retainer Prince Toyomi to present
　　　　humble local products as tribute. I humbly hope that through
　　　　the guidance of the senior councilors, this may be conveyed especially
　to Your Honor's attention. I cannot contain my utmost gratitude. With sincere reverence, this is incomplete.
　　　　　　　　　　　　Chūzan King

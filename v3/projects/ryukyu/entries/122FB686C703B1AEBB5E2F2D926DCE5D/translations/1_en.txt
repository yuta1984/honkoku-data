Item: Regarding the succession of the shogun, in accordance with precedent, the King of Chūzan of the Ryukyu Kingdom wished to present congratulations through an envoy, for which Matsudaira Satsuma-no-kami submitted a formal inquiry. Concerning this envoy, there has been a long-standing custom of bringing them along during sankin (alternate attendance) since the time of his ancestors. At the beginning of the previous shogun's reign as well, Satsuma-no-kami brought the father of this envoy to participate in the visit to Edo. Therefore, this time too, it was decided by the rōjū (senior councilors) that a Ryukyuan envoy should accompany the next summer's visit to Edo, and all matters should follow precedent.

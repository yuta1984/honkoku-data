They drifted to Shimatama-no-ura and Karakigaura in Hizen, and recently in the nearby seas of that domain, five or six vessels met with shipwreck, causing precious people, livestock, and products to sink to the ocean floor—all of this was caused by the lack of sturdy ships.

His Majesty above also deeply feels pity for this situation, and will bestow one steam ship, and will also grant relief rice to the families of those disaster victims who suffered harm.

Therefore, you should deeply understand the profound intentions of the Imperial Court. There are other matters to be communicated privately, but these will be deferred to a later date." Having heard this, the Ryukyu officials said they would deliberate thoroughly and then respond, and withdrew. On April 8th, three Ryukyu officials appeared at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, had an audience with the Minister of Internal Affairs, and responded to the previous day's private instruction, saying: "The country of Ryukyu is located remotely in the southern seas, being merely a small island with a circumference of just over one hundred ri. We have traditionally maintained no military forces whatsoever, establishing our way of governance solely through courtesy and protocol. Even when foreign ships have called at our ports, we have managed peacefully until today through verbal negotiations alone. Therefore, if military camps were now to be newly established, foreign countries would correspondingly apply pressure, which would rather create difficulties. Regarding the bestowal of the steam ship, this is truly a profound act of benevolence for which we cannot adequately express our gratitude. However, in recent years, we have already received extremely generous favor and care regarding other matters, and with the enormous government expenses involved, our small country truly has no means to repay such kindness.

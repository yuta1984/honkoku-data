carved and shown widely to people from all directions, to delight the eyes of the elderly and children who have difficulty walking. Now, although illustrations of these procession costumes are said to be published each time they come to court, they are all merely ventures aimed at profit, and there are none that could serve as a proper means of viewing their actual appearance. What I now publish is not of that sort. Since these are things I have intimately heard about and accurately seen and copied, there should be little difference from what one would see with one's own eyes. How admirable!

Royal brothers, royal uncles, and state ministers are all called "Prince of [place name]," and those who govern one prefecture are called "Aji of [place name]" (under the old system, each prefecture was governed by one Aji).

Royal uncles-in-law, Hōji officials, and purple-capped officials are called "Ueekata of [place name]," and yellow-capped officials of third rank and below are all called "Peechin of [place name]." Those who do not yet have territories are called "Peechin, son of [village name]" or

衣 (Clothing)
　No belt
　Collar has
　small notch
　
　All clothing is loose and wide without rear crossing panels (jin). The sleeves are large, two to three shaku in length, not extending beyond the fingertips. The end of the right collar is made with a notch, and there are no clothing belts. Most are made from banana fiber cloth (bashōfu) or banana kudzu. They have geometric patterns with colors, and men's and women's clothing are the same, called "kin."

帯 (Belts/Sashes)
　Large belts are one jō four to five shaku in length and six to seven sun in width, wrapped around the waist three to four times. Mixed floral brocade ground is most precious, followed by large floral brocade belts, then those with dragon patterns on yellow or red ground. The lower quality ones are all mixed-color floral belts.

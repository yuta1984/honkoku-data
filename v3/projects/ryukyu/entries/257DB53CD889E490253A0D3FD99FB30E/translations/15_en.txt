The gracious letter of the 18th day of the second lunar month of this year was recently
conveyed by Matsudaira Satsuma-no-kami, and upon perusal, it brings great joy. Upon examination, last summer
the tribute envoys from your noble country, Kin and Kunigami, came to Edo and had audience with our
Great Lord, thereby offering congratulations to our
Young Lord. When they were granted leave to return to their country, various gifts were bestowed upon them. Your Excellency, being overwhelmed with gratitude,
now sent Prince Yomitanzan as an envoy of appreciation, who has now again arrived at the shores of Satsuma Province.
This matter was reported in detail by Satsuma-no-kami. Such sincere courtesy can truly be called observing proper etiquette.
This was immediately brought to
the august attention, resulting in

expressions of joy - do not trouble yourself with distant concerns. Moreover, you have expressed gratitude for the humble gifts that we sent - is this not also sin-
cere courtesy? Other matters will be related by Satsuma-no-kami. With utmost reverence, inadequately expressed.

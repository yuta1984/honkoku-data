I respectfully send an envoy to celebrate the birth of the young lord and extend wishes for his longevity. This is entirely an auspicious sign of your country's peace and tranquility, which is most fortunate. Furthermore, regarding my succession, it has reached high attention, and I learned of it last winter in the year of Mizunoe-Uma from Mitsuhisa of Satsuma Province. My reverent joy and gratitude cannot be expressed in words. If Your Excellency would compassionately guide both envoys and convey this message upward, it would be nothing but fortunate. With utmost reverence and humble words.

The letter dated the 18th day of the 2nd month of this spring was conveyed from Matsudaira Satsuma-no-kami this month, and we clearly understood that last summer
the envoys from your country, Kin and Kunigami, offered congratulations to our
young lord, and when they were granted leave to return to their country, various gifts were bestowed upon them, and both envoys as well as their attendants
all received gracious gifts. Your Excellency being deeply moved by this gratitude, now again sent Prince Yomitanzan as an envoy to cross to Satsuma Province to express gratitude and present local products. Satsuma-no-kami
reported this matter in detail, and when it was conveyed accordingly, it greatly stirred
joyful expression and should put distant concerns at ease. Other matters are entrusted to Satsuma-no-kami to convey. With utmost reverence, inadequately
expressed.

envoys from your country who came to court, Kin and Kunigami, we were informed of their safe return to their country,
which is most precious news indeed. Now again, Satsuma-no-kami Hisahisa has reported that you have sent the envoy Prince Yomitanzan to land in Satsuma Province, and that you have expressed gratitude for the gifts previously bestowed,
and this time have sent local products with profound consideration. The details will be conveyed through Satsuma-no-kami. With utmost reverence

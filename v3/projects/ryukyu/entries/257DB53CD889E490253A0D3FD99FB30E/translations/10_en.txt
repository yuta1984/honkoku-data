five garments, to Kunigami: 10 pieces of silver, all sent in the same manner.
　　　
　　　Last summer, having been granted audience under your honorable curtain government,
　when offering congratulations for the joyous occasion of the birth, the two envoys Kin and Kunigami, according to old custom in early winter on the 17th or 18th day,
　arrived at the shores of our Ryukyu Kingdom, and immediately both
　humbly received the gifts bestowed by the two lords. Truly, through the guidance of the three elders, receiving such
　great benevolence was inevitable. Moreover, we were summoned and
　in the palace hall, bowing low, we
　had the honor of seeing the Shogun, and furthermore received silver and summer garments, and even our attendants and servants received some
　silver - this brings no small honor to the Ryukyu Kingdom. Therefore, this time we are sending Prince Yomitanzan as an envoy
　to cross over to your honorable country, and he will provide detailed explanations about local products and other matters to Matsudaira Satsuma-no-kami,
　so we shall not elaborate on details here. With utmost reverence and respect.

Tadakatsu

To the King of Chūzan
　　before the residence

Last early autumn, when I had an audience and your country conveyed congratulations for my enthronement, the envoy Prince Gushishū arrived in Chūzan Kingdom on the 18th of early summer. First, I report that Your Excellency under the shogunate remains peaceful and well, which brings me a thousand joys and ten thousand delights, great fortune indeed. Moreover, under the guidance of the Three Elders, Gushishū ascended to the castle and paid respects to both Great Lords, and thereafter until the day of departure at Egusuku, I humbly received congratulatory letters and was granted folding screens and silver. Not only did the envoy receive clothing and silver, but his retinue was also honored to receive silver. This truly fills me with awe and joy beyond measure. Therefore, this vassal, through Kanegusuku, humbly expresses gratitude and respectfully presents only these humble local products. As Lord Satsuma Mitsuhisa will provide detailed explanation, I close my brush here. With fear and reverence, I bow deeply.

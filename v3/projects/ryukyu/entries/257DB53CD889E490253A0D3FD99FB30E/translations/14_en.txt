Your gracious letter of the 18th day of mid-spring was recently conveyed without error by Matsudaira Satsuma-no-kami and read.
Most fortunately, as per your intention, last summer the envoys from your country, Kin and Kunigami, came to Edo and had audience with our
Great Lord, and also offered congratulations to
His Lordship the Dainagon. When they were granted leave to return to their country, gifts were bestowed upon them. Your Excellency, being moved by such generous sentiment,
sent Prince Yomitanzan as an envoy of gratitude to cross to Satsuma Province. This matter was reported in detail by Satsu-
ma-no-kami and immediately brought to
the august attention, resulting in
imperial pleasure, which should put distant thoughts at ease. Also, you have expressed gratitude for the humble gifts that we sent - is this not
the height of sincere courtesy? Now again you have sent two types of local products, which we have received with great joy. Other matters
will be conveyed through Satsuma-no-kami. With utmost reverence, inadequately expressed.

The successive reign of the Great Tree Shogun Ietsugu continues for many years in this generation, and there is nothing that surpasses the universal celebration under heaven. I respectfully dispatch an envoy to extend congratulations for this ten-thousand-fold great celebration. The details shall be explained by him. I humbly request that through the gracious consideration of the venerable elder, this may reach the exalted ears, which would be most fortunate. With fear and trepidation, I state this incompletely.

　　　　　　　　　　　　To the Residence

　We have perused your gracious letter with great joy. Regarding the matter of the succession confirmation of the Ryukyu Kingdom, in recent
　years, having dispatched an envoy from Satsuma-no-kami for a long time, the envoy Kunigami
　arrived, and the local products presented as congratulatory gifts of gratitude, as listed in the catalog, were presented to
Both Their Lordships, whereupon
when Kunigami was summoned before Their Presence, their mood was exceptional, and we perceive their great satisfaction.
　The details will be conveyed through the envoy's oral report. Respectfully stated.

　having received notice from the Lord of Satsuma Province, we present [gifts] as a joyous ceremony of reassurance

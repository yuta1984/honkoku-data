Last year in late summer, when we offered congratulations for
the joyous occasion of the birth, the envoy arrived at the shores of our Ryukyu Kingdom on the 17th day of the 10th month of the previous winter.
Immediately, we
humbly received the gifts bestowed by the Young Lord, and the degree of this great benevolence is deeper than the great ocean.
Moreover, that the envoys and their attendants and servants were also granted some silver is entirely due to the guidance of the Great
Elder, and we know not how to express our gratitude for such good fortune. Therefore, we are sending the sister of Prince Yomitanzan across the sea, and she will report about local products and other matters to Matsudaira Satsuma-no-kami,
so we shall omit the details here. With utmost reverence and respect.

Last summer, having been granted audience under your honorable curtain government, when we offered congratulations for
the great foundation of the birth, the envoys from Kin, Kunigami and others arrived at the shores of our Ryukyu Kingdom on both the 17th and 18th days of the 10th month of the previous winter.
Then, from the
Young Lord, we humbly received the bestowed gifts. Such profound benevolence and sincere feelings are entirely due to
the Great Elder. Furthermore, the hundred bundles of cotton thread granted by your honor, as well as the silver and summer garments bestowed upon the envoys, are truly most excellent. For details, Prince Yomi-
tanzan, who will cross the sea this time, will provide thorough explanations to Matsudaira Satsuma-no-kami, so we shall omit them here. With utmost reverence and inadequate expression.

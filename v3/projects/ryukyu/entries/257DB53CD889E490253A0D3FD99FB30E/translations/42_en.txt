After the ceremony paying respects to your Great Lord was completed, I respectfully received the various items bestowed by Your Honor according to their number, and since Kunigami and his retainers were also fortunately blessed with your benevolence, being unable to contain my fearful joy at Your Honor's kindness, I dispatched the envoy Yafuso to Satsuma Province to offer thanks and present several local products, which were duly reported. I imagine this was received favorably and should be peacefully conveyed before His Presence. The Satsuma Shōshō will explain the details, so I shall not elaborate further.

Your letter of the sixth day of the sixth month recently arrived from Satsuma Province, and we learned that last autumn your country's envoy Kunigami came from afar to present tribute, paid congratulations to our Great Lord, ascended to the castle to perform the ceremony of respect, and upon completion was granted leave to return to his country. Moreover, since Kunigami and his retainers also received gracious hospitality, and in Your Honor's overwhelming joy, we heard that you have now dispatched the envoy Yafuso to Satsuma Province to respectfully express gratitude for the gracious benevolence, and we have understood this matter in detail. When this was reported before His Presence, he was pleased, and moreover, thanking me for the humble things I sent, he further bestowed local products as recorded separately, which I have received. Such generous sentiment is cause for joy. For the rest, since the Satsuma Shōshō will explain it,

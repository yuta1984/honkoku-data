Through the distant arrival of the envoy Gushishū, I have perused your gracious letter with great joy. Regarding the matter of the Ryukyu Kingdom's succession that was conveyed from the Lord of Satsuma last winter, as gratitude for the assurance, the local products presented in tribute were brought by the envoy as listed in the catalog, and when he ascended to the castle and prepared them for imperial inspection, he was immediately summoned before His Presence. His mood was truly excellent, and receiving the gifts for myself as listed on paper shows such deep consideration that I am filled with joy. In that case, though it may be modest, I am sending two hundred bundles of Echizen cotton to express my small token of appreciation. This is also conveyed through the envoy's oral message. Brief.

Generally, stones of all sizes are extremely hollow and porous. Large ones are like towers or houses, crystal clear and transparent, with ancient vines intertwining and nesting, growing luxuriantly green. Even the fist-stones have remarkable characteristics. They are found abundantly throughout mountain cliffs and seashores. However, their material is very porous and sharp, easily brittle and breakable. Only the whetstone is extremely hard and smooth; when used as a grindstone, it surpasses those of China. Therefore, it has been offered as tribute for generations.

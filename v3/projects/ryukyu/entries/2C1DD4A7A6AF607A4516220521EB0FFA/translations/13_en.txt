The fukugi tree has leaves like those of the winterberry holly (soyogo) but particularly large, growing in pairs at the nodes, about two sun in length, shaped like kidneys, thick and glossy. It is also called tokiwa-gi (evergreen tree). The tree grows straight upward to a height of over one jō, and does not wither throughout the four seasons. The leaves can be used to dye green. It produces small yellow flowers and bears fruit like oranges that are edible. There is also another tree, called garabo (karaho) in the local name. All its leaves resemble those of the fukugi, also growing in pairs at the nodes, producing white flowers resembling plum blossoms. It bears fruit in the eleventh and twelfth months. Both are called kunshi-ju (gentleman tree). The leaf patterns have paired veins like woven fabric, and the central part becomes transparent when illuminated by sunlight, taking on a golden-yellow color. According to old traditions, it is called tōru-ju, with leaves like those of oranges, and this is precisely that tree.

do not immediately fade and fall off. 《See illustration above》

There is also another variety that has no branches or leaves, resembling fist-sized stones of deep red color, with the upper part forming honeycomb-like structures. Fine holes cluster together densely, packed full like the head of a cockscomb flower. All grow on the seabed. Only the fishermen of Bajishi Mountain are able to dive deep into the water and retrieve them. Even the fishing households of Zhongshan who can enter the water cannot match their ability.

Stone fungus grows in the cracks of rocks on the seabed along the coast. To the northwest of the Tianshi Hall, on the sea, there is a small rocky mountain called Stone Bamboo Shoot Cliff, which the local people also call Naminoue. Below this cliff is where stone fungus gathers. The old records of previous envoys state: "It has roots and leaves; large ones are like basins, small ones like jars. Others resembling mushrooms, chrysanthemums, or lotus leaves are too numerous to count. Even Lingbi stones and sheep-belly stones are not worth mentioning in comparison." Only the people of Bajishi Mountain can dive deep to retrieve them. Having been long soaked in salt water, they develop a fishy odor and are especially unapproachable. After being out of water for a long time, the fishy smell gradually subsides, but they become brittle and break easily, making them difficult to transport far. Therefore, they are not considered precious.

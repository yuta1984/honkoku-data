...this thing they call [the Snake Sea] might also be in the Ryukyu. In Kōbō Daishi's "Shōryō-shū," in a letter given to the Fuzhou Regional Inspector during his journey to Tang China, it states: "The southern wind rises in the morning, crushing the fierce heart of Tamna.

Due to the fierce north wind, on the fourteenth day at dawn, drifted to the foot of those mountains. The so-called Ryūkyū is a land that devours people. With no wind in any direction, knowing not where to go, suddenly encountered a southeast wind and proceeded pointing toward the northwest."

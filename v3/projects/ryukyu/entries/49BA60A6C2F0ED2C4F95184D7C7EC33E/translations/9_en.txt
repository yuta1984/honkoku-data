there is no such thing. Even now, there is a system in Edo that prohibits violating the characters of the Imperial name. However, recently in Kyoto it has become the practice to write the characters of the Imperial name with missing strokes. When I inquired of Tōshukura as to from which Imperial era this began, he did not give a clear reply. From my speculation, this may have been something proclaimed by Emperor Reigen or others. Since that quasi-empress favored the Six Codes, perhaps the system of character avoidance began then. Following the ancient Chinese system, there are ritsuryō regulations, but rather than becoming accustomed to such things, in our Imperial country we avoid them in our Imperial country's manner through character readings [remainder illegible due to binding].

I humbly believe this to be so. Though this is pointless lengthy discourse, I have mentioned it in the course of our discussion. I look forward to meeting you in person to discuss the myriad matters on my mind. With respectful bows.

　　Noble Clans
The four great surnames of Shuri are Shō, Ō, Mō, and Ba. The Shō clan is a branch family of the royal Shō surname; being somewhat distantly related, they are called Shō to distinguish them, and thus generation after generation do not intermarry with the royal family. Among the native people who marry into the royal family are only the three houses of Ō, Mō, and Ba, which have served as royal uncles and legal officers for generations. Currently there are three serving as legal officers: Ba Kenzu, Ō Jidō, Shō Sei[?]koku-jō, and Mō Kunshū《marginal note: maternal grandfather of the current king Shō Kei; the queen consort is of the Ba clan》. The genealogies of all are unclear and await further investigation and compilation.

The Kume Thirty-Six Surnames were all Fujian people granted during the Hongwu and Yongle reigns. By the Wanli period, only five surnames remained: Cai, Zheng, Liang, Jin, and Lin. In the 35th year of Wanli, two additional surnames were granted: Ruan and Mao. The descendants of each surname have not flourished greatly. There are many others who obtained registration and rose to become noble and prominent, but these are not from the old granted surname families. Now examining the genealogies of the nine surnames, many among them are learned in literature and versed in national studies.

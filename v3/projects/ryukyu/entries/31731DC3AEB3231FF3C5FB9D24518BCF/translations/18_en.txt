　Style
　All garments are loose and wide, without rear crossed lapels (jin). The sleeves are large, two to three shaku in length, but do not extend beyond the fingertips. The right collar end is made with a notched style, and there are no clothing belts. Most are made from banana fiber cloth (bashōfu) or banana kudzu. They feature striped patterns interwoven with colors, and both men's and women's clothing are the same, called "kin."

Obi (Sash)
　The large obi is fourteen to fifteen shaku in length and six to seven sun in width, wrapped around the waist three to four times. Those with mixed floral brocade ground are most precious, followed by large floral brocade obi, then those with coiling dragons on yellow or red ground, with the lowest grade being all mixed-colored floral obi.

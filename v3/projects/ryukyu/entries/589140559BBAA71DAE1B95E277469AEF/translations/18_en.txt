Clans
The four great surnames of Shuri are: Sho, O, Mo, and Ba. The Sho clan is a branch family of the royal Sho surname. Being somewhat distant, they are called Sho to distinguish them. Therefore, generation after generation they do not intermarry with the royal family. Among the native people who intermarry with the royal family are only the three families O, Mo, and Ba. They serve as royal uncles and legal officers through the generations.

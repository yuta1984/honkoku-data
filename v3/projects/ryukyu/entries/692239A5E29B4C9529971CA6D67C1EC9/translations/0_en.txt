I humbly write to you. Last year, His Lordship the Shōshō graciously bestowed upon me eighty pieces of katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes). I received them with deep gratitude, considering it truly a most fortunate blessing.
I wish to express my gratitude for this favor and humbly present this modest letter to your honorable persons.
With utmost reverence and humility, I respectfully state.

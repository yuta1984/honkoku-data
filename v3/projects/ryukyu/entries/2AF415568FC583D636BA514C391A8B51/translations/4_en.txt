It was written as "Ryukyu" (流求). In the Yuan History, it was written as "Ryukyu" (瑠求). Later, it was changed to the current characters for Ryukyu (琉球). 《Note: The Chuzan Denshin-roku states that the characters were changed to the current ones during the Hongwu era of Ming, but this is an error - it happened before that time》○In ancient times, our country called Ryukyu "Uruma no Kuni" (Country of Uruma). In the Sagoromo by Daini Sanmi, it says "Uruma Island on the right," and in the notes it states "Uruma Island is Ryukyu," making this clear. Also, in a poem from the Senzai-shu: "How uncertain - are you a person from Uruma Island, showing such an unknowing face to my words" (by Kinto).

It was also anciently called "Oki no Shima" (Offshore Island). The people of that country themselves also call their country "Okino." "Tell my parents that I am on a small island off Satsuma Bay, O eightfold sea winds" - this poem was composed by Taira Hangwan Yasuyori Nyudo when he was exiled to Kikaigashima, and it appears in volume seven of the Genpei Seisui-ki.

Also, in the royal palace of Ryukyu Kingdom, there hangs a plaque reading "Dragon Palace Castle." Also, in the capital there are shrines to the Heaven Dragon and Earth Dragon, which are called Tenpi. What foreigners now call bodhisattva is this deity. 《Note: What we call Funatama Myojin as the guardian deity of ships is also this god》Therefore, the sea palace (wadatsumi no miya) spoken of in the age of gods, the Dragon Palace Castle of Urashima's child, and the Dragon Palace that Tawara Hidesato is said to have visited are what is commonly called today...

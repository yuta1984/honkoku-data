○Brief Genealogy of the Kings of the Ryukyu Kingdom

When heaven and earth were first created, one man and one woman came into being through spontaneous generation. <<Spontaneous generation means being born without parents>> The male deity's surname was "Haansuu" <<Kanshi clan>>, and his name was "Kauratotsu" <<Katsuratsu-tou>>. The local people call him Karounen-kun. The female deity was called "Tobato" <<Tabatsu-da>>.
<<Another text says the husband was called "Shinerikyu" and the wife "Amamikyu">> Kauratotsu and Tobato became husband and wife. However, their island was small and floating on the waves. Therefore, they planted a tree called "Tashika" that had grown up, gradually forming it into the shape of mountains, planted grass called "Shikyu," and also planted trees called "Atan" to form the shape of a country.

Since there was no fire here, they begged for and obtained fire from the Dragon King at the bottom of the sea, and the Five Elements were already complete. The local people later called these two yin-yang deities "Amamiku." Finally, the two deities united and bore three sons and two daughters.

The first son "Tenson-shi" - This is the beginning of the royal line
The second "Urukan" <<Unryuu-kan>> Male ○ Becomes the beginning of the Aji (local lords)
The third "Merukan" <<Menryuu-kan>> Male ○ Becomes the beginning of the common people

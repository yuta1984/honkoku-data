I humbly write to you. Regarding the unexpected fire that destroyed the Nigatsuida tea house in Ibusuki on the second day of the eleventh month of last year, I consider this to have been truly unforeseen. However, I have been informed that His Lordship the Shōshō has relocated to the Minato main residence in the same area, and that there are no concerns regarding his well-being. I am greatly relieved to hear this.

In connection with this matter, I am writing in this manner to inquire about His Lordship the Shōshō's well-being. I humbly request that you kindly arrange this at your convenience. With utmost respect and humility, I remain,

Ōsato Prince
16th day of the 4th month　Chōkyō

To Lord Shimazu Bungo
To Lord Shimazu Iki

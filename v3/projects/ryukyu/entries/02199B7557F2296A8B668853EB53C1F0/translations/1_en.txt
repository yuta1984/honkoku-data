Preface to the Record of Ryukyu Tribute Missions【Two square seals】
Beyond the seas, those who follow the prevailing winds and pay tribute to our country include Ryukyu and Korea. As for Ryukyu, considering them descendants of Minamoto no Tametomo, we have regarded them as if they were family. Later, diplomatic exchanges were sometimes interrupted, but since the Shimazu clan advanced westward with warships, they completely submitted and permanently became our vassal state. Since then, they have come to court from time to time, maintaining proper ceremonial protocols without ever neglecting them for over two hundred years. Is this not indeed a flourishing relationship? I am already over seventy years old, and I have been fortunate to personally witness their tribute missions several times. In past years, I wrote an outline of this and compiled one volume of "Record of Tribute Missions."

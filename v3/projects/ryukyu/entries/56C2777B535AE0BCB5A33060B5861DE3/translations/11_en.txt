The matter is recorded below. Women's clothing does not differ much either. They make the outer garment into an uchikake (outer robe), pulling the collar with both hands as they walk. The system of sleeping garments is the same as Japan's. There is also something called fusuma, made so that clothing can be worn with both sides reversed. In general, the woven fabrics for caps and sashes are woven in a place called Min in China and sold to this country. In the Ryukyu Kingdom, only banana fiber cloth is made. Women of each household all do hand-weaving. Items manufactured in Shuri are considered superior quality.

○Annual Events
On New Year's Day, the king changes his ceremonial dress, first pays respects to ancestral virtue, then receives courtesy from his retainers. The ceremony on the 15th of the same month is the same as New Year's Day (retainers visit the castle every 15th of each month). The king bestows tea and sake. Now, women of common households play by bouncing balls, and also perform an entertainment called ita-mai (board dance). As shown in the diagram, a wooden platform is placed in the center with a board laid across it, and two women stand facing each other at both ends. When one person jumps up, the other is down below, and with the force of the jumping woman falling back to her original position, the woman standing on this side bounces up five or six shaku. The skill lies in causing the body to tumble. Since this land is 25-26 degrees north of the Arctic, the warm climate is exceptional, peach blossoms bloom, and while flowers bloom in all four seasons in this eternal spring, this month is especially considered the peak season.

○Song and Dance (Utamai)
When song and dance performances are held at the royal palace, a stage of five or six jō square is
constructed, with curtains hung on all four sides. The musicians wear red and green robes, each
wearing their respective headbands, and hold three-stringed instruments covered with snakeskin, fiddles, flutes, small gongs, drums,
and other instruments, arranged in two rows. They slowly sing the musical score,
and after a while, the curtains at the side of the steps are raised and the dancers appear.

○Four young boys wear vermillion tabi (split-toe socks), don long robes of five colors,
and wear caps made of black leather with red tassels attached. They ascend
the stage while turning and sit facing the musicians. When the musicians take their caps
and wind the red tassels around the tops of the caps before giving them back, the boys receive them,
stand up, and dance with foot beats matching the melody. This is called
the Hat Dance.

○Four young boys hold golden fans decorated with flowers, wear red cloth
sashes, dress most gorgeously in five-colored robes,
and hang rope rings adorned with five-colored flowers around their necks.
They ascend the stage, hold the ropes in their hands, and
dance with hand claps, similar to the Hat Dance. This is called the Flower Rope Dance.

○When four young boys wear five-colored robes and ascend the stage, sitting before the musicians,
the musicians give each of them four pieces of small bamboo clappers. The boys take them, stand up,
and dance on stage while clapping. This is called the Clapper Dance.

○Six warriors wear short robes with large sleeves in black and white striped patterns,
tie golden headbands around their foreheads, carry white staffs, ascend the stage, and dance
with the sound of striking in rhythm with the beat. This is called the Martial Dance.

○Two young boys wear five-colored garments, hold golden balls with bells attached to four sides and long
red cords attached, stand left and right dancing while leading two lions
onto the stage and dance while making the lions frolic. The lions perform various
movements, making it an entertaining piece. This is called the Ball Dance.

○Three young boys dress refreshingly, ascend the stage, receive golden staffs about one shaku long
from the musicians, and dance while striking them together. This piece is called the Staff Dance.

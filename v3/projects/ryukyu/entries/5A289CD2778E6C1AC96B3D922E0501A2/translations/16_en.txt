He fell ill and reached Minoo-ura. Government forces came and attacked. His sons fought and repelled them, finally
reaching Kurodani, where he entered a temple, shaved his head, and earnestly said to his sons:
"I, as a general of the Retired Emperor, opposed the government forces. I cannot escape punishment. However,
if I request surrender through Yoshitomo, he might perhaps redeem my life through his merit.
I am old and not worth lamenting. If only I am pardoned, you too may be able to save your lives."
Tametomo remonstrated, saying: "This is inadvisable. The Retired Emperor is

finally commanded Kamada Masakiyo to kill Tameyoshi at Suzaku-no. He also killed his younger brothers
Yoriken and four others below him, as well as his young brothers Otowaka, Kamewaka, Tsuruwaka, and Tennō at
Funaoka-yama. After Tametomo parted from his father, he went into hiding at Wada in Ōmi, concealing himself
in the mountains during the day, emerging into villages at night, and having his servant pose as a monk to beg for food
through mendicant practices. When he heard that his father and brothers had been killed, he gnashed his teeth and said: "That I did not
kill Yoshitomo earlier was for my father's sake. I never imagined that today my father would be

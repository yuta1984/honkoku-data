become my enemy. I shall proceed to Chinzei, raise troops and attack the
capital, slay the traitorous son Yoshitomo, thereby comfort the souls of my father and brothers, restore the Retired Emperor
to the imperial throne, and myself become the General Pursuer of all sixty provinces."
He hastily tried to proceed to Chinzei. Hearing that the Taira general Taira no Iesada was blocking the
route with forces, he could not accomplish this. He happened to fall ill and could not take to the road, so he lodged in a commoner's
house. People saw his imposing physique and reported it to the Police Commissioner Minamoto no Shigasada.
Shigasada led over three hundred men and surrounded him. Tametomo, naked, gouged out pillars and
struck down several men. However, weakened by illness and his strength exhausted, he was finally bound and
brought to court. His crime was judged worthy of execution. The court, pitying his brave strength,
reduced his sentence by one degree from death, severed the tendons in his arms, and exiled him to Izu Ōshima. He was placed in a large palanquin,

carried by over twenty men, with fifty mounted guards escorting him. While Tametomo was in the palanquin,
sometimes he would become angry and exert his full strength while sitting, making the palanquin so heavy it could not
move. Sometimes he would laugh and say, "Riding in a palanquin with soldiers in attendance, proceeding to my place of exile—this too
is my glory." His arrogant and insolent words were extremely severe. Eventually reaching Ōshima, he
commanded the islanders, saying: "The Emperor has granted me Ōshima. Those who do not
submit will be executed." He subsequently came to control the seven islands including Miyake and Hachijō, and
married the daughter of Ōshima Deputy Saburō Dayū Tadashige. Though Tametomo had his arm tendons severed, his skill
in archery remained superior to before. After residing there for several years, he fathered two sons and one daughter. In
March of Eiman 1 (1165), Tametomo was patrolling the seashore when he saw white herons flying south and said: "Herons
cannot fly far distances, yet now they fly south. There must be an island due south nearby.

朝 received one. Tametomo's body was so enormous that he could not wear the armor, so he alone wore
different armor. Tametomo, leading his sons with a hundred horsemen, defended the west gate. Tametomo with twenty-
eight men defended the Nishi-Kawara gate. Soon after, Yoshitomo, Kiyomori and others came attacking with a large
army. When spies reported this, the Retired Emperor was greatly alarmed. Tame-
tomo angrily said: "Indeed, it is just as I predicted!" Yorinaga regretted not having heeded Tametomo's words,
and perhaps fearing that he would not serve effectively, hastily appointed him to the position of Kurōdo (chamberlain).
Tametomo said: "The enemy forces are already upon us. We should quickly devise defensive strategies.
Why would I need the position of Kurōdo now?" At this point, Yoshitomo attacked the Ōi-mikado gate.
Yoshitomo resisted this. Tametomo was about to compete with Yoriken for the vanguard position in battle. Tametomo
thought: "I previously committed a sin by opposing my elder brother. Now

to compete with my brother again for the vanguard would compound my sins." So he apologized to Yoriken and
said: "Please go ahead, elder brother. If the enemy proves too strong to handle, quickly give me your command."
Kiyomori advanced and reached the eastern embankment at Nijō-Kawara. His general Itō Kagetuna and
his two sons Itō Go and Itō Roku advanced first. Tametomo shot them, piercing Go through the chest
and penetrating Roku's sleeve. Kiyomori was greatly frightened and retreated. His mounted warrior Yamada Yoshi-
yuki, filled with rage, turned back to fight. Tametomo shot again and killed him. His horse bolted and entered Yoshitomo's
camp. The arrowhead that pierced the saddle was as large as a huge mirror. His general Kamada Masa-
kiyo took it and presented it to Yoshitomo, saying: "This must surely be shot by Hachirō-kun (Tametomo)."
Yoshitomo said: "He is young in years, and his physical strength is not yet fully developed. How could he loose such an arrow?
This is merely a false device to frighten the enemy. Go and test this."

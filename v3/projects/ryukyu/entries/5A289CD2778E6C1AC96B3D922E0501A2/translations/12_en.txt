Tametomo stepped forward and said: "I, your subject, while in Chinzei (Kyushu), fought twenty major battles and dozens of minor ones, and brought all nine
provinces under submission. For attacking castles and breaking through battle lines, nothing surpasses night warfare. I humbly request
permission to attack Takamatsuden tonight, set fires on three sides, and launch an assault from one direction.
Those enemies who flee the fire will be struck by arrows, and those who avoid the arrows will burn to death.
Moreover, among the enemy generals, only my elder brother Yoshitomo knows warfare. However,
I will fell him with a single arrow. As for the remaining officers and soldiers who resist, I will engage them in all-out
battle, shooting to death those at a distance and cutting down those nearby. Weaklings like Taira no Kiyomori with their
weak bows and thin arrows will all fall of their own accord at a single touch of my armored sleeve. At that time, the imperial palanquin will
be unable to depart, and when I shoot their attendants, the attendants will abandon the palanquin and flee.
Then we shall move the palanquin here and respectfully escort His Majesty there. This task will be as

easy as turning over one's palm. Before dawn breaks, the great undertaking will be completely accomplished."
Yorinaga said: "Tametomo's plan is not yet well thought out. Night warfare is
the affair of young men's private feuds. Now two emperors contend for the realm, and the Minamoto and Taira face each other. We should properly
employ dignified battle formations. Over a thousand mounted warrior-monks from the southern capital (Nara) will respond to our summons and come at dawn.
It is not too late to wait until tomorrow to fight." Tametomo came out and railed, saying: "Examining the affairs of Wa
and Kan (Japan and China), regulating court ceremonies and etiquette is the duty of court nobles.
When it comes to military campaigns, this should properly be entrusted to generals. What do court nobles
know? My elder brother has strategic cunning and will certainly come to attack tonight. What benefit will tomorrow's warrior-monks
bring? My plan is not adopted. Such is fate!" Yoshitomo also offered his counsel, but Yori-
naga would not listen. Then he divided the eight suits of armor among his six sons, giving one to Yoshi-

The envoy reached Ming and was cast ashore on Miyako Island. The islanders, seeing the rituals of service to the great nation of Ryukyu, were moved and led their tributary islands to declare themselves vassals and pay tribute. From this time, Chūzan grew increasingly powerful. In the 9th year, mizunoe-saru (1392), the king and Crown Prince Bunei sent an envoy to Ming, presenting a memorial and tributing horses. They also had three men - Kyōshi Nichiji-mai, Katsu-hachi Bazai, and Kyūshi Jin'etsuji - enter the Imperial Academy to study. The Ming Emperor's ceremonial treatment was extremely generous. The Ming Emperor also granted thirty-six surnames of Fujian people to serve as interpreters for tributary missions. For the first time, music was regulated and ritual protocols were established. From this time, literary education flourished daily, and the Ming Emperor praised it as "a nation of propriety and righteousness." In this same year, the King of Sannan also sent three men - Kyōshi San'gorō-o and Saishi Jittarō-o Kaданshi - to Ming to enter the Academy and study. 

After Miyako and Yaeyama submitted as vassals, Satto gradually became arrogant and extravagant, constructing a tower several jō tall for his amusement and observation. He said, "With me residing in this tower, who would dare cause me harm?" During the night, a snake appeared and bit the king's left hand. The hand eventually swelled, festered, and had to be amputated. From this he developed illness, and after reigning for forty-six years, he died on the 5th day of the 10th month of Ōei 2, kinoto-i (1395), at the age of seventy-five. During Satto's reign, a man from Motobu County named Kenken Ufuoya found a fine horse on the seashore. It happened that some Chinese were shipwrecked there, and seeing the horse, they earnestly requested it, returned to their country and presented it to the Ming Emperor, whereupon it became the Ming Emperor's mount. In the first month of a certain year, on New Year's Day, rain fell in the courtyard of the royal castle. People considered this an auspicious omen.

King Bunei, whose name was Nakanoshimmono, was the son of King Satto; his mother was a daughter of the Aji of Katsuren.

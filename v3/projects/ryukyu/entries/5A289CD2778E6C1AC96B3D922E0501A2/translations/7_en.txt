quotes from those books. Therefore, even when there are vulgar expressions, we do not completely alter them. Moreover, our ancient books that record matters about Ryukyu generally mix elegant and colloquial language, and many directly reproduce the original texts of their time. Now we also generally preserve their authentic form. This too is one aspect of providing material for historical research.

One: I, together with Yonemoto-ko, have engaged in the editing, supplementing, and proofreading of this book during leisure time from official duties. We drafted as we went, proofread as we went, and sent to print as we went. There will likely be errors such as confusing "lu" and "yu" [i.e., similar-looking characters]. May readers kindly understand these various [shortcomings].

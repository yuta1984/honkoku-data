Sudō Ieki was about to shoot Ietada. Tametomo stopped him and said, "He is a peerless
man of the realm. How could I bear to kill him? If I achieve victory, I shall make use of him
another day." The enemy forces pressed forward, riding on their advantage. Tametomo said to Ieki,
"The enemy forces are numerous. Though our troops may face a hundred with one, we cannot
ultimately achieve victory. I shall shoot their commander and rob him of his spirit." Ieki said,

The Retired Emperor personally instructed and dismissed them. Tameyoshi requested to remain and protect him, but was not
permitted, and all departed shedding tears. Tameyoshi attempted to flee to the eastern provinces. On the way,

"Private feelings cannot overcome the great duty between lord and retainer. Please remain in this land and raise our child. After he grows up, he will surely accomplish great things." He thus bid farewell to his wife and child, cast off the moorings, and departed. The lady returned to Uraminato with the child and lived there. The child was intelligent from a young age, and as he grew somewhat older, his behavior differed from others, his character was outstanding, and he greatly resembled his father. This was King Shunten, Lord Sontoku. In the fourth year of Jishō, kanoe-ne, when Sontoku was fifteen years old, the people respected his talent and virtue and made him the Uraminato Aji. The territory was greatly well-governed. At this time, corresponding to the twenty-fifth generation of descendants of the Tenson clan, the government had declined, and the powerful retainer Riyu murdered his lord and established himself in power. Sontoku raised the banner of righteousness and took up arms. The four directions responded to him like an echo. Sontoku led troops to question his crimes. Riyu angrily said: "The former lord was immoral. I received Heaven's mandate and became the country's ruler. What kind of person are you? You recklessly move troops and bring disaster upon yourself." Sontoku was greatly angered and said: "You have enjoyed the lord's favor for generations, yet you rebelled against Heaven and usurped the throne. I now raise the banner of righteousness to punish the rebel and thus repay the resentment of Heaven and man." He encouraged his soldiers and urgently attacked the castle. Riyu defended well. Arrows and stones fell like rain. Sontoku roused his courage and finally broke through the castle gate. The entire army rode the momentum and burst in all at once. Riyu's strength was exhausted; he killed his wife and children and committed suicide by disembowelment. The people were greatly pleased and submitted, elevating Sontoku to the throne. This was in the third year of Bunji, hinoto-hitsuji, when Sontoku was twenty-two years old. After Sontoku ascended to the throne, he worked diligently to seek good governance and greatly changed the national customs. At this time the royal castle was still narrow and cramped, and the governmental system was not yet complete. Sontoku expanded its scale and made it quite magnificent.

A man from Satsuma named Kawabe Michitsuna went against Minamoto no Yoritomo's wishes and fled to Kikaijima. Yoritomo also suspected that Yoshitsune's followers were hiding on this island, so in the fourth year of Bunji he sent Amano Tōkage and others to attack Kikaijima and subdue it.

○Waka Poetry

The people of this country are often skilled at waka poetry. This shows that Japan's civilizing influence reaches far to distant islands. Therefore I record this.

During the Genroku era, when returning to the country after going to Beijing in Qing China:
Ikeshiro Oyakata:
"Everyone look, now truly Chinese brocade - the sleeves departing from the northern capital"

Secret Love - Makabe Oyakata Kenkan:
"Though there are no times when hearts do not communicate, how painful is the moon that catches others' eyes"

Upon reaching a place called Matsuura and seeing the moon on the thirteenth night of the ninth month:
Yomitanzan Prince Chōkō:
"Remembering what I saw each autumn, how nostalgic appears this moon in my homeland's sky"

When there was no following wind and the ship was stopped at that place for more than ten days:
"Waiting at the bay for favorable winds to blow, how many nights of restless sleep have accumulated?"

Upon seeing Atsumori's grave mound at Suma Bay:
"If you ask the number of flowers scattered and piled at Suma Bay, the pine wind that knows no sorrow blows"

At Fushimi village:
"Does everyone find grass pillows so lonely? Alone in Fushimi, the moon's shadow at midnight"

The Pine of Karasaki:
"Since the bay winds do not bend the branches in this reign, may the pine of Karasaki flourish even more"

Mano Bay:
"With frost-bound pampas grass sleeves chilled with breath, famous birds cry at Mano Bay"

Mount Kagami:
"Since this is the mirror mountain of an unclouded reign, even the reflection of the lord's thousand years can be seen"

Seeing Mount Fuji from Tago Bay:
"Who would have thought that coming out to Tago Bay, I would see the clouds of Fuji's high peak"
On Mount Fuji:
"If people ask, how shall I answer? Words cannot reach Fuji's snow-white beauty"

In early November, reaching Musashi Province and seeing the moon there:
"Though traveling clothes have come so far, what remains unchanged from my homeland is that moon facing me"

On a morning when snow had accumulated at a place called Fujieda:
"Asking about the night moon, with moon shining cold on my grass pillow, white snow piles on the fields at dawn"

Mount Matsuo:
"The evergreen color cannot be seen at Mount Matsuo when snow falls on both peaks and foothills"

○The hairstyle of young boys consists of a large topknot with a hairpin over one shaku long inserted. Their appearance is the same as girls, with only the difference being that they wear a sash around the waist. They come of age at seventeen or eighteen, or around twenty years old. The center of the crown is shaved to make a small topknot, and two short hairpins are inserted. One has a head like a narcissus flower with a six-ridged shaft, and one is shaped like an ear pick, both about five to six sun long. At twenty-four or twenty-five they grow mustaches, and from thirty-one years old they grow beards. Confucian scholars study at the Imperial Academy (Guozijian) in Qing China. Doctors study in Qing China and also in Satsuma domain. Those who have not studied in Qing China or Satsuma are forbidden from practicing medicine. Therefore, those who study under domestic doctors and practice medicine privately cannot carry medicine cases or medicine boxes. For other studies, people from Kumemura practice ancient calligraphy and read using Chinese pronunciation. Other people mostly learn Japanese hiragana, revere Master Ōhashi Tamaki, and use Japanese-style reading marks and punctuation when reading. Painting is between Japanese and Chinese styles, with its own distinctive school. Music derives from Ming and Qing traditions using their instruments. There are ensemble performances, singing, etc., namely "Eternal Spring," "Congratulating the Qing Dynasty," "Music of the Sacred Dynasty," "Songs of Joy," "Songs of Longing for Home," "Beautiful Spring Scenery," "Phoenix Song," "Celebrating the Imperial Capital," "Lantern Festival Excitement," "Miscellaneous Music," etc. Additionally, there is native folk music. Arts like flower arrangement, tea ceremony, and go are generally the same as in Japan. Military arts include archery, horsemanship, and gunnery. The people also well practice martial arts. The skilled ones can break jars with their fists and even kill people. Generally, men go out to serve in official positions and do not know household affairs, while women stay inside and manage household administration. ○Girls at five or six years old are given cotton, ramie, and silk to learn women's work, and marry around fifteen or sixteen after betrothal. Regarding marriage ceremonies, noble families and official households have their own spousal betrothal gifts. Commoner households use one bale of rice and two kan of money as betrothal gifts. For childbirth, in the past natal hair was not shaved, but recently it is said to be shaved until two or three years old. Female children use needles to make many small beauty spots from fingers to arms. This is done throughout the country. Women's clothing is somewhat longer compared to men's, with short skirts. The bottom is folded to make it double-layered. Even when walking, it does not open in the wind. They do not use sashes but hold the collar with their hands when walking. Generally, once a woman becomes someone's wife, she is not permitted to meet other people, only meeting them after becoming close friends. However, they do not carelessly exchange words. For example, when visiting someone, if the master is out and not at home, even close friends do not enter the house but return home. This avoids suspicion of adultery. In markets throughout the country, only women gather to conduct trade, and men do not participate. Therefore, no one carries goods on their shoulders; everyone places a grass ring on their head and carries various goods on top. This is like the women of Yase in Japan. Wives of samurai also go out to trade. Those holding cloth about one shaku long in their hands are said to be samurai wives. Courtesans mostly wear red jackets and insert tortoiseshell hairpins. They are not permitted to use silver. When meeting officials on the road, they remove their straw sandals and prostrate on the ground. Common women insert long tortoiseshell hairpins upside down.
○When people die, the temporary burial lasts three years, waiting for the corpse to decay before taking it out, washing the bones clean with awamori, placing them in a small jar, and storing it in a tomb. Tombs are made by digging horizontal holes in mountainsides, placing jars inside, and making doors with wood or stone at the entrance. Viewed from afar, they look like arched bridges. Now this system has been abandoned, becoming ordinary earth burial, mostly relying on temples. Male graves have white cloth and hats placed on them, with staffs erected and straw sandals and wooden clogs placed there. Female graves are covered with palm leaves, fans, and white cloth. Flower vases are set up and incense burners are placed as well.

Since Yoshihisa was granted sovereignty over the Ryukyu Kingdom, it became a tributary state for all generations, and their service as vassals was conducted with great reverence. From then on, whenever there was a succession in the Shogun's house, the King of Chūzan would send congratulatory envoys, and when there was a succession in their own country, the Shogun's command would be transmitted through the Satsuma lord, and only after that would the succession to the throne take place, with envoys of gratitude sent later. Since that country lies between China and Japan, during royal successions, they also receive investiture from the Qing dynasty. However, since China is far and Japan is near, without Japan's assistance, they cannot even procure daily necessities. Therefore, the people of the country call it "Great Yamato" and hold Japan in very high esteem.

○ Explanation of Official Ranks and Court Dress Illustrations
Ranks range from first grade to ninth grade, with distinctions between senior and junior grades naturally existing. The king's sons and brothers are called princes (wanzu) 《senior first grade》. Feudal lords are called aji (anzu) 《junior first grade. In ancient times, aji lived in their territories and governed those lands, but because each wielded authority, the seventeenth king Shō Shin reformed the system, making them reside in the castle town of Shuri, and dispatched officials called satuji and kikan one by one to govern the affairs of their territories, having the harvest tributes delivered to the aji at year's end》. The ministers who oversee state affairs are called the three chief ministers and oyakata, namely the Tencaushi, Chicaushi, and Jincaushi 《senior first grade》. Ministers below them are called oyakata 《junior second grade》. Those called pechin are military officials 《ranging from third to seventh grade》. Those called satunushi are young attendants in personal service 《eighth grade》. Those called tsukutushi are ninth grade.

Ryukyu Tales

What is called "Kaigū" (Sea Palace of the Sea God) in the Kamiyomaki (Chronicles of the Age of Gods) is likely referring to this country. I have recorded this in detail in the "Geography Section" of my compiled work "Banshō Zatsugu."

The indigenous people living in the rural areas of this country do not call it "Ryukyu" but rather "Okino." This is probably the ancient name of the country, as recorded in the "Chūzan Denshin-roku." The land is located 140 ri south of Satsuma Province, with a north-south length of 60 ri and an east-west width of about 14-15 ri. In ancient times, the country was divided into three parts: Chūzan, Sannan, and Sanhoku. However, Great Ryukyu was unified under Chūzan. There are thirty-six islands belonging to this country. Maps are included in the "Sangoku Tsūran Zusetsu" and other books, so I will omit them here.

○The Beginning of Creation [Appendix] When Chinzei Hachirō crossed to Demon Island

According to the "Chūzan Seikan," the founding ancestor of Ryukyu is called Tensōshi. In the beginning, one man and one woman naturally came into being and became husband and wife. This is called Amamiku. 《Chūryō's opinion is that this should be Amamiko. Many ancient Japanese words remain in Ryukyu》 They bore three sons and two daughters. The eldest son is called Tensōshi and became the first king. The second son became the ancestor of the lords (daimyo), and the third son became the ancestor of the common people. The eldest daughter is called Kunkun, and the second daughter Shukushuku—they became the guardian deities of the country. One became a heavenly god, and the other became a sea god. The descendants of Tensōshi ruled for twenty-five generations, maintaining the realm for approximately 17,802 years before the lineage ended. After that, the son of Chinzei Hachirō Tametomo, named Shunten, became king. 《Shunten's son Shunba》

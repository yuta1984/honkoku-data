The floor height is three to four shaku, and the ridge is not very high. This is to avoid sea winds. The roof uses tiles. Tatami mats, doors, and shoji screens are the same as in Japan. The pillars are large trees, using Rakan cedar that grows on Kikaigashima Island. 《Note: Rakan pine is maki (Japanese yew). Is Rakan cedar also a type of maki?》 The price is extremely expensive. The wood grain is extremely beautiful, and it is not eaten by insects for several years. As years pass, its luster becomes like a mirror. The walls are made with board wainscoting and covered with Chinese paper. Bamboo blinds are extremely coarse, woven with thin round bamboo and hung from the eaves. For garden construction, boxwood and pine varieties are planted on artificial hills, trimmed either round or square. Small ponds are dug to keep fish, small stones are erected in the water, and cycads and other small trees are planted on them for ornamental purposes.

Generally, outer enclosures are made by stacking oyster stones. 《Note: Oyster stones are oyster stones, perhaps a type of shore stone?》 In large houses, they are especially polished and cut to fit together, so they appear as if cut from a single sheet of stone, making them quite magnificent. Temple grounds mostly use trimmed boxwood hedges. This also grows only in this country.

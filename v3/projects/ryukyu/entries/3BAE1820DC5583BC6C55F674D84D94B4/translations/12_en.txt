There were also many black people there. The food on the ship was all bread and sweet potatoes.
　　　I think that bread is made from wheat flour mixed with sugar.
　　　
In November of that same year, we arrived in the Hawaiian Islands. This place called Hawaii is six to seven hundred ri across the ocean from America, and the people's appearance and language are the same as America's. In recent years, this place has become a prosperous land, like Kawaguchi in Osaka in Japan. It is a trading post for various countries with many wholesale merchants from different nations, and there are also tea houses and pleasure quarters. This country has no cold or hot seasons, and both spring and autumn are like August in Japan. There is no rice or wheat, but sweet potatoes and taro grow well year-round in this place, without the need for fertilizer. When one taro plant is harvested, a single native person cannot carry it as a load. The preparation methods include roasting, making into rice cakes, or boiling. There are no foods other than root vegetables. The houses closely resemble those in Japan with thatched roofs, though in recent years board roofs are common. There is a stone that is produced in that country, which they take and use like tiles for roofing. The people of this place, regardless of social status, age, or gender, walk about carrying canes made of red sandalwood or ebony. Those of even slightly higher status carry swords attached to guns, or pistols when they go out. There are also guns without swords, all with flintlock mechanisms. Strangely, they wear something like a hat with a hole in the middle of the hat through which they pass their hair. Women arrange their hair like the Tenjin knot style. For clothing, men wear tube sleeves with something like leggings, and wear shoes. They have no rain gear and do not leave their houses during rainy weather. The people of this place eat different foods for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Since they eat root vegetables, they have no chopsticks or tea bowls, but prepare them in many ways with good flavor, place these root vegetables on dining tables, sit on stools, and eat. In the morning, they roast black soybeans and drink the decoction. At lunch time, they scoop up water to drink. At dinner time, they drink tea like that in Japan.

The wind blew fiercely, so they could only pray to various gods and buddhas, hoping somehow to reach Japanese land. At this time, about one to of white rice remained, which they cooked little by little into rice gruel to barely fill their stomachs as they drifted.

Since much seawater had entered the boat, they bailed out the water and tied the mast to the gunwale to prevent the boat from capsizing, hoping somehow to reach land where they could drink water freely and die in peace. They continued drifting at the mercy of wind and tide. From the evening of the ninth day through the tenth day, the cold was severe, penetrating their skin, and moreover their wet clothes froze like iron, making their hands and feet so numb they could not move them freely. They burned remaining boxes and other items to warm water, barely moistening their throats and warming their hands and feet. On the eleventh day, the rain and wind became violent, and at this point all five men were exhausted from days of hardship, wishing to die as soon as possible, yet still unable to die. On the twelfth day, the rain stopped and around midday, looking at the open sea, they saw many birds called tōkurō (albatross) flocking together on the ocean surface. Seeing this, Denzō said, "Everyone, rejoice! It appears we are approaching a place where we should die. Since there are many tōkurō here, there must surely be an island nearby."

Around evening that day, something that appeared to be an island was faintly visible to the southeast, and the next day it was confirmed to be an island, so everyone rejoiced. When they approached closer, they saw rough waves crashing against the rocky shore, and there seemed to be no suitable place to land the boat, but they brought the boat to the water's edge anyway. Two men jumped onto the rocks, while the remaining three, weakened by hunger from days of shipwreck, left the boat, but during this time the boat capsized and was smashed to pieces. All three men barely managed to cling to planks and reach the rocky shore, immediately grabbing and eating seaweed with their hands. This shows how starved they were. Now, all five men finally reached land and saw many tōkurō, so they killed four or five birds with sail yards and ate them. This island was uninhabited, a small island about one ri around the mountain, with no bamboo or trees, only sparse growth of grass varieties such as kaya (miscanthus) or kumi. They searched for human dwellings but found no trace of people. The cold was severe, and water was

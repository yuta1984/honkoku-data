During that time, they collected a considerable amount of gold, though there were many good and bad aspects to this, which he told about when he returned to America. After some time passed, he lied about wanting to go to California again, and around the year of the Rooster, he came to Oahu and made arrangements to return to Japan. In truth, he wanted to go to China and rely on merchant ships, but since it was a country that had never sailed to Japan before, they could not take him along. They obtained a small boat, placed him on this vessel, and said they would transfer him to that boat near Japan to cross over. So they obtained one boat and entered that vessel. Now, Manjiro was beloved by the ship's captain and had made arrangements to become his adopted son, but since they had not yet performed the religious ceremony, they were not yet married. Therefore, he sent written notices to both that person and his intended bride to break off the engagement. They then set sail, and in the same year, they lowered the small boat off the coast of Ryukyu, and he crossed over to Ryukyu in it. At this time, Manjiro offered his respects and also composed a letter. Since Toraemon remained in Oahu at this time, he wrote in that letter that since he was successfully returning to Japan this time, Toraemon should return as soon as a good opportunity arose, and he had the large ship deliver it. Then the three men - Denzō, Goemon, and Manjiro - arrived by ship at the Ryukyu Kingdom. The Ryukyu people were very suspicious, so the three quickly arranged their hair in Japanese style topknots. This finally made them recognizable as Japanese. However, they were told that unless their hair was as it had been before, they could not be sent to Satsuma Domain, so they grew their hair out again, and after about a year, they were handed over to Satsuma. From there they were strictly received and then sent to Nagasaki. In Nagasaki, Manjiro's books, astronomical instruments as souvenirs, and two pieces of gold he had mined, each one inch square, were all confiscated by the authorities. What was returned to them were their clothes plus one additional garment each. Also, all three men brought back one long storage chest each. Now, when they were transferred from Nagasaki, the official told the receiving official that while they were being handed over this time, they should be retained locally as useful men, and this matter was reported to Tosa Domain. All ended well.

{{Marginal note: At this time the shōgun also sent a letter in response to their courtesy. That letter was written using kana characters and addressed to the ruler of Ryukyu Kingdom}} Thereafter, people from that country regularly came to trade at Hyōgo harbor, and during Taikō Hideyoshi's era, they sent envoys to congratulate him on his knowledge of national unification.

In this year [unclear]}} At the beginning of our house [Tokugawa], they were defeated by Satsuma and finally became like a tributary state.

The above is what appears in various records of our country. It is said among people that that country descends from Chinzei Hachirō Tametomo, and therefore many of Tametomo's historical sites still remain in that country today. From around the time of Lord Higashiyama, that country appears to have used our country's kana script, and furthermore, many people from that country became skilled in our country's waka poetry. {{Marginal note: Many waka by Ryukyuan people can be found, and some are quite accomplished}}

The names of mountains and rivers, as well as personal names, are largely in our country's language, and particularly because they worship our country's deities, many historical sites are well known in the world. Therefore, it is certain that the founding ancestor of that country was a person from our country. However, the claim that they descend from Tametomo may be questionable. In general, there are many unclear matters regarding the misdeeds and other affairs of that country. Regarding sea crossings to Ryukyu: from Japan twice yearly in spring and autumn, and from Ryukyu once during the sixth or seventh months, ships make the crossing.

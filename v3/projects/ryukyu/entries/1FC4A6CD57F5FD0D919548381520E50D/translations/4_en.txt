The details of what person he was—he is the unworshipped ancestor. He reigned for fifty years. His eldest son Shunba Junnei succeeded him and reigned for eleven years, then died nine years later. His eldest son Gihon succeeded and reigned for eleven years.
At that time many people suffered from epidemics. Therefore (the throne was passed) to Eiso. Eiso was a descendant of the Tenson clan.
Gihon eventually abdicated his position, and so forth. Thus, the founding ancestor of Ryukyu was the child of Chinzei Hachirō 
Tametomo. When it comes to Eiso, he is said to be a descendant of the Tenson clan, so it seems as though Tametomo's
bloodline was severed, but the people of that country to this day传say they are descendants of Tametomo
and call him King Shunten. Therefore, Eiso also appears to have been a collateral relative of Shunten
who ascended to the throne. Since Tametomo was a descendant of the imperial grandson of our court,
he would be called a descendant of Tenson. It is clear that he was a descendant of Emperor Seiwa.

To view Eiso as a separate clan is an error,
and so forth.

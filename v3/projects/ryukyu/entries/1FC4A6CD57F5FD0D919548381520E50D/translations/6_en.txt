The books say that what is customarily called "Dragon Palace" (Ryūgū) refers to this country. This too is difficult to understand. It seems that what was simply called "riukiu" from ancient times was later written using borrowed Chinese characters as either "Liuqiu" (流求) or "Ryukyu" (琉球).

Regarding the affairs of this country as they appear in foreign historical records, the ancient matters of this country are not detailed. During the time of Emperor Yang of Sui, a man named Zhu Kuan was sent to explore that region. When he first reached that country, the people refused to negotiate, so he captured one person for interrogation. Afterward, he returned with ships and went to that country again, capturing five hundred men and women and bringing them back. {{Marginal note: This was the beginning of this country's name first appearing in foreign books as well}}

Thereafter, during the Tang and Song periods, there was no communication with China. During the Yuan dynasty, envoys were sent to invite them, but they did not come. When the Ming dynasty began, tribute missions were sent during the early Hongwu period of Taizu. That country was divided into three parts: Chūzan, Sannan, and Sanhoku. After being granted feudal ranks, the two countries of Chūzan and Sannan were bestowed with gold-plated silver seals. {{Marginal note: Does "gold-plating" mean gold was burned onto it?}} At this time the three countries fought among themselves, so the Son of Heaven mediated between them. Sanhoku was also granted seals along with embroidered textiles. {{Marginal note: Chūzan and Sannan were enfeoffed in the 15th year of Hongwu, while Sanhoku}} {{Marginal note: was enfeoffed in the 16th year of the same period, corresponding to the 22nd-23rd years of Eitoku under Emperor Go-En'yū in our country, during the time of Shōgun Rokuon-in}} {{Marginal note: I say privately that this annotation is quite difficult to understand, and the transcription may have been altered.

This country in ancient times did not come even when attacked during the Sui and Yuan periods, nor did they come when invited. However, during the Ming dynasty, they came of their own accord by ship to offer tribute and sent the country's lords, retainers, and children to China for scholarly pursuits.

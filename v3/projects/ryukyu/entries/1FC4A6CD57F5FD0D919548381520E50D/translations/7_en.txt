Therefore, the Son of Heaven was extraordinarily pleased with their loyal and obedient intentions. {{Marginal note: For this reason, among foreign countries that turned against others, none was as close to the Ming as this country}}

Thirty-six surnames of Fujian people skilled in navigation were granted to serve as yearly conveniences for travel back and forth.

From the time when Hashi, the great-grandson of Satto, succeeded to this lineage, the custom began whereby whenever successive kings changed reign, the Son of Heaven would send envoys to that country for investiture ceremonies. {{Marginal note: This became the established custom of that country}}

Shō Toku, grandson of Hashi (personal name), succeeded to the throne at the end of the Jingtai era and soon destroyed Sannan and Sanhoku, annexing those countries. {{Marginal note: From this time the Ryukyu king came to be called the Chūzan king. Jingtai was the era name of Yingzong, the fifth emperor of the Ming}} {{Marginal note: During the Hōtoku period of Emperor Go-Hanazono in our country, the shōgun was Higashiyama Yoshimasa. The first communication with our country also occurred at this time. As will be seen later, the custom of sending tribute to China twice every three years began from this time. It is said this custom continues today}}

During the reign of King Shō Ei, the sixth-generation descendant of King Shō Toku, due to the Japanese Regent {{Marginal note: [unclear text about military campaigns]}} that country [text unclear]. King Shō Ei died shortly after, and his son King Shō Nei succeeded him. In the 31st year of Wanli, an envoy was sent to that country for re-investiture. {{Marginal note: Wanli was the era name of Shenzong, the 13th emperor of the Ming. The 31st year corresponds to Keichō 8 in our country under Emperor Go-Yōzei, the year when the Divine Ancestor was appointed as Seii Taishōgun}}

That envoy submitted a memorial saying: "The people of Ryukyu will inevitably return due to the Japanese. They have been deceived by the Japanese, who force sharp blades upon them and control their comings and goings." Not long afterward, in the same 37th year, King Shō Nei was captured by Satsuma Province. In the same 40th year, King Shō Nei sent an envoy to request permission to return to his country and also to notify them of changing policy in favor of Japan. {{Marginal note: The 37th year of Wanli corresponds to Keichō 14 in our country}} {{Marginal note: In the fifth month of this year, the Shimazu took the king of that country prisoner. After detaining the king for three years, they released him. In Keichō 17, there was an incident where they petitioned the Ming military command in Fujian regarding trade matters on behalf of our country}}

The above is what appears in various foreign historical records. I have not examined records of events after this period.

Regarding the appearances of this country in our country's records, ancient matters are also unclear. In the third year of Jisai during the reign of the 55th emperor, Emperor Montoku, when the monk Enchin {{Marginal note: Chishō Daishi}} was traveling to Tang China, he was blown by north winds and reached Ryukyu, according to the Genkō Shakusho. This may be the first time that country's name was heard of in our country. After that, nothing was heard until the time of Shōgun Higashiyama Yoshimasa, when Ryukyuan envoys came in the seventh month of Hōtoku 3. {{Marginal note: This was during the time of Chūzan King Shō Toku, who had annexed Sannan and Sanhoku in that country}}

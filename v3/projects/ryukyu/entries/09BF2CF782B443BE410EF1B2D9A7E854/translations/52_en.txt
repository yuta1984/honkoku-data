Regarding the matter you indicated to me, I am particularly grateful for the twenty volumes of white hemp cloth you bestowed upon me. As items to express my gratitude along with this report, I humbly present one box of white feather fans and five bundles of court incense. With utmost respect and humility, I state this.

The bell itself rose to the bell tower, and the woman manifested the appearance of a demon woman. Using the striking mallet, she emerged upside down from inside the bell and struck at the monks. The monks did not flinch in the slightest and continued praying without moving. Then suddenly the sky darkened, the earth shook violently, and thunder and lightning raged fiercely. The woman became a demon as she was and grabbed Shōju and ran away. This too is one act of a kyōgen play.

These two stories are both ancient events that occurred in the Ryukyu Kingdom over a hundred years ago. Besides these, they perform Chinese kabuki kyōgen plays. Japanese sarugaku (Noh comedy) has also been transmitted, and mai-hayashi (dance with musical accompaniment) are performed as well. They greatly favor gidayū-bushi (a style of narrative music) and skillfully learn and recite the melodic passages of works like "Ashikari" (The Reed Cutter).

○ Ryukyu Songs
In Master Sorai's "Ryukyu Heishi-ki" (Record of Ryukyu Envoys), it states: "Songs with sanshin are Ryukyu music." The song says:

Kyō no (rare) hokorashi ya ya (luxurious) nahoru re kana
(Indeed, this exists) tatero (coloring materials) tsubo de aru hana no (budding)
(flowers) tsuyu maya ta goto (as if bearing dew)

Nakara considers that this song is fundamentally based on the meaning of "shōja hitsumetsu" (the living must die). It certainly resembles a lament. Utai-uta (Noh chanting songs) are also included.

This is called "oni-mochi" (demon rice cake) and given as gifts. According to local people's explanation, long ago when demons appeared in this country, they made these items for rituals. This is said to be a surviving custom from that time, likely meaning demon expulsion and plague prevention. On the 24th day, they send off the kitchen god, and welcome the kitchen god back for the first time in the new year's first month. {{Marginal note: They send off and welcome back the kitchen god}}

○Coming of Age
Before coming of age, people of this country arrange their topknots like coiled snakes, and pierce long hairpins {{Marginal note: Shown in the diagram above}} from bottom to top in reverse, with the tips reaching their foreheads. When they have grown up and receive the cap ceremony, {{Marginal note: Capping at twenty is the common practice. This should be the case in this country as well}} they shave the hair on the crown to make the topknot smaller and secure it with short hairpins. During China's Ming dynasty, there was no hair shaving, but this practice began from the era when they accepted investiture from the Qing dynasty. In my (Nakara's) opinion, instead of becoming completely shaven like monks, they escaped with partial shaving.

○Hair Shaving
Medical officers are called "gokansē," and tea ceremony monks are called "sōsō," also referred to as "osadō." They wear the flat caps illustrated above and dress in something like black tokusen robes.

○Architecture
I omit the diagram of the royal palace since it does not differ from the palaces depicted in Chinese paintings. Common people's houses are not much different from Japanese construction,

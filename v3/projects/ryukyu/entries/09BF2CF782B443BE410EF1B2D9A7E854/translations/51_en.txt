　　　　　　　　　At your lodging

Furthermore, regarding the letter and gifts you sent last spring, I am most grateful. I understand that they did not arrive due to the messenger ship being wrecked, and I appreciate your thoughtful consideration. The above.

I have respectfully read your letter. I trust you continue in good health and carry out your duties well - a most admirable thing.

has already been published as part of "Bankoku Shinwa" (New Tales of All Nations), and "Ryukyu Tales" was also included in it, but Korea,
Ryukyu, and Ezo have long
belonged to our Imperial Court, and their national affairs were already roughly familiar to us, so
they were excluded at the time of publication. However, the bookseller repeatedly requested it,
so the original draft was decided to be published, and they asked me for a preface. But
the general framework of the country and detailed civil affairs are thoroughly
described in the book, so what more could I say? I merely record these words as
a preface. Autumn, ninth month of Kansei Kanoe-Inu year

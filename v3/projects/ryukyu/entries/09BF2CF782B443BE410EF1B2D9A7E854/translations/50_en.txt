I respectfully write this letter. I trust you continue in good health and carry out your duties well - a most admirable thing. During our travels, we were grateful for your courteous care and attention. We have safely returned home. Accordingly, I am presenting you with one box of white feather fans and five bundles of official incense. With humble respect, I respectfully submit this.

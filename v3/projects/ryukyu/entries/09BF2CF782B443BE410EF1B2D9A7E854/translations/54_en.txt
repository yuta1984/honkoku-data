He smiled and said, "Anticipating that you would undertake such a venture, I have already extracted the Ryukyu section from the manuscripts of 'Bankoku Shingo' and made it into a small booklet." He then brought it out and graciously bestowed it upon me. Not knowing where to place my dancing hands and stamping feet [from joy], I immediately had it carved into printing blocks and published it to the world. I hope that because of this book, the price of paper in the capital will become dear. Truly, the master's authored books are the money tree of my house.

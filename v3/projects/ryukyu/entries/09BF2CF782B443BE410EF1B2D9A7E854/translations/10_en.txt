義久 was granted dominion over the Ryukyu Kingdom, and from this time it became a permanently tributary state, serving as vassals with great reverence. From then on, whenever there was a change of shogun in the Tokugawa house, the King of Chūzan would send congratulatory envoys, and when there was a succession in that country, the shogun's imperial command would be transmitted through the Lord of Satsuma, and only then would the successor take the throne, later sending envoys to express gratitude. Since that country is located between Tang (China) and Japan, at the time of succession, they also receive investiture from the Qing Dynasty. However, since Tang is far away and Japan is near, without Japan's assistance, they cannot even manage their daily necessities. Therefore, the people of that country call it Yamato and greatly revere Japan.

Ranks range from first grade to ninth grade, with distinctions between senior (正) and junior (従) grades, of course. The king's children are called ōji (princes). 《First senior grade》Domain lords are called aji. 《First junior grade○In ancient times, aji lived in their domains and governed their lands, but because each wielded their own authority, the seventeenth king, Shō Shin, reformed the system, made them reside in the castle town of Shuri, and sent officials called Satsuji and Kikuhan, one each, to govern the affairs of their domains, and at year's end, the tribute was delivered to the aji》.

Prince Yomitanzan Tomotsune

Every autumn I saw it as a friend—nostalgic for my homeland's sky, I gaze upon this moon's reflection

　　As there was no favorable wind, we kept our ship
　　anchored at that place for more than ten days

Waiting for favorable winds at Matsuura Bay—how many nights of restless sleep on the waves have accumulated?

　　At Suma Bay, seeing Atsumori's grave mound

When I ask about the traces of flowers scattered and floating at Suma Bay, the spring wind blows, knowing nothing of sorrow

　　The Pine of Karasaki

In this reign when even the bay winds do not disturb the branches, may the pine of Karasaki prosper even more

　　Mano Inlet

Frost forms on the pampas grass sleeves, the moon shines clear, and plovers cry at Mano Inlet

　　Mirror Mountain

This mountain is the clear mirror of an unclouded reign, so even the reflection of my lord's thousand years can be seen

　　Seeing Mount Fuji from Tago Bay

Who would have thought that I would come out to the shores of Tago Bay and see the snow on Fuji's lofty peak?

　　Fuji

If someone were to ask, how could I speak of it? Words cannot match the pure white of Fuji's snow

　　In early winter month, arriving in Musashi Province,
　　seeing the moon of that place

Though I have come far in travel robes, the one thing unchanged from my homeland is this moon that faces me

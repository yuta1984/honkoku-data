The ways of the world, do they never change? Are there no people remaining
at the evening twilight of the town?

There are also songs sung by courtesans:
Thread willows, if there are storms in the heart, noyote haro
mono, is it good in the wind?

Regarding this song, perhaps Master Sorai could not understand it either, as he provided no annotation.

○ Shinto Deities
The "Ryukyu Jiryaku" states: During the Keichō era, a Japanese monk who was in that country recorded matters of its climate and customs. According to his writing, at the beginning of this country, one man and one woman came into being through supernatural birth. The man was called Shinerikyu and the woman was called Amamikyu. (Nakara considers that Amamikyu is the Amamiku mentioned in the "Chūzan Seikan." This theory differs from the account of creation recorded above. They should be considered together. The correctness should be verified by people from Satsuma.) At this time the island was small and drifted on the waves. They planted the Tashika tree that had sprouted to form the body of mountains, planted Shikyu grass, and also planted the Adan tree to form the body of the country. Eventually three children were born. The first child became the origin of rulers in various places, the second child became the origin of priests, and the third child became the origin of common people. There was no fire in that country, but they obtained it from the Dragon Palace, the country was completed, people were born, and a guardian deity appeared. This is called Kinmamon. (Nakara considers that Kinmamon is what is recorded in various books as Kunshinfutsu. The character readings of Kinma and Mono are pronounced as Kinma and Mon.)

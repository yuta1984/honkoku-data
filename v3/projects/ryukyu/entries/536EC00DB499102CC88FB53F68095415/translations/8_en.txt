In the third room, with one tatami mat separating the upper south area, platforms were arranged in a row extending east to west along the central passage. Two ōmetsuke provided guidance, and when Gushikawa immediately took his seat at the center of the second room,
the Oki-no-kami and Tajima-no-kami conveyed that gifts were being bestowed by Ōgosho-sama and Dainagon-sama. After performing one bow and withdrawing to the third room to respectfully receive the gifts, following instructions from the two ōmetsuke,
he withdrew to the fourth room. The bestowed items were taken away by the gift attendants toward the carriage entrance, and Gushikawa withdrew to the palace hall, guided by the two ōmetsuke.
First, Satsuma-no-kami performed one bow to the elders and withdrew to the palace hall.

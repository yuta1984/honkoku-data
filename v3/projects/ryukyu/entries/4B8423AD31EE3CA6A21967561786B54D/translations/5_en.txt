1. The spectacle of the procession centers on the Ryukyu King, gaku-dōji (court musicians), and others with entirely different customs, unusual
　clothing, and the sounds of musical instruments. From the imperial visit in Bunka 3rd year (Year of the Tiger) 
　to this current Year of the Dragon, this is the 27th year since that visit, and
　when we might see such a procession again in the future is uncertain - it is truly a magnificent sight of recent times.
　Therefore, if one possesses this book, it will greatly surpass what those who only saw the procession momentarily experienced,
　and for those who did witness it, possessing this will lead them to even greater detail.

1. The procession covers several hundred ri by sea and land, so there are slight increases and decreases along the way.
　This book, using reliable methods, details
　and records the authentic procession.

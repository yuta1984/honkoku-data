Seal of the King of Ryukyu
In the 10th year of Shunzhi (1653), King Sho Shitsu came to return the former dynasty's old seal and requested investiture. It was reissued. In the 1st year of Kangxi (1662), the investiture envoy first arrived in the country and bestowed this seal upon the king. The seal inscription has six characters: "Seal of the King of Ryukyu" (琉球国王之印), with Manchu script on the left and seal script on the right, not bearing the title "Chuzan" (Middle Mountain).

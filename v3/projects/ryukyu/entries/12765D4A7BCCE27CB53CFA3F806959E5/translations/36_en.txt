"Neither leopard nor bear nor brown bear, but an auspicious beast of the king, with no matching couplet." This was set up by the Kume people.

East of the embassy, in front of Tenpi Palace, an artificial mountain was constructed in a marsh pond, and a white crane was made by cutting paper. Above the pond, a large pine tree was erected, planted in the ground, and on top of it another white crane was made, arranged as if the two were calling to each other in flight. The surroundings were made into artificial mountains using paper bark, with dozens of varieties of flowers and grasses arranged around them. In the center, an old man and two deer were created, positioned as if calling out birthday congratulations to the mountain. This was set up by the Naha people.

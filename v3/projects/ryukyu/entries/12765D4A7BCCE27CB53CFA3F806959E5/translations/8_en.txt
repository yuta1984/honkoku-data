The four characters "Three Imperial Bestowals" hang above the main beam. This dates from the enfeoffment of King Shō Shitsu in the second year of Kangxi, who was the great-great-grandfather of the current king. In the twenty-second year of Kangxi, King Shō Tei was enfeoffed, who was the great-grandfather of the current king. The king's grandfather Shō Jun did not live to become king, and the king's father Shō Eki did not live to request enfeoffment. Up to the present King Shō Kei, five generations have passed, all receiving
His Imperial Majesty's seal and enfeoffment. Over sixty years, the great ceremony has been performed three times, with imperial grace extending to five generations. This is truly a rare occurrence in all history, so we specially record it to show to distant peoples and clarify our
Imperial Majesty's governance that knows no bounds like Heaven, with nurturing care extending infinitely to the sea corners where the sun rises. Between the left and right pillars, we have specially written two placards: one recording the names of the册使 (investiture envoys) of the former Ming, and one recording
the names of our dynasty's thrice-dispatched envoy ministers.

Placard Record Appendix
During the Hongwu era of the former Ming, King Satto of Chūzan first established communications with the court. When Bunei succeeded to the throne, he first came to report the death and request succession. Until the end of the Ming dynasty, sixteen generations were transmitted, with each generation requesting enfeoffment, involving over thirty investiture envoys. These are all recorded in the official histories, but unofficial records contain many errors. If Chinese and foreign books differ, this is not in accordance with the principle of unified writing under one rule.
Since the Qing received the Mandate of Heaven, King Shō Shitsu first came to request enfeoffment, and up to now through five generations, the investiture ceremony has been performed three times, all carrying our
Imperial Majesty's precious seal. This is an even greater magnificent event in all history. Recording this together serves to illuminate the institutions and be prudent in our envoy duties. Sometimes it took over a year for dispatched envoys to arrive, and after the Jiajing era, delays of three to four years occurred.

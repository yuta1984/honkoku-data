Whether interior or exterior, all are equally under my care and pacification. All those who offer tribute are not forgotten in our benevolent concern, and those with merit are surely rewarded, none are overlooked even in distant places. This is to demonstrate tender care and illuminate the great ceremonies. You, Crown Prince Sho Eki of the Kingdom of Ryukyu, inherited from your predecessor and received the throne, continued his aspirations and demonstrated loyalty, generation after generation establishing meritorious service. Serving the realm and turning inward [toward China], generation after generation maintaining court attendance, sailing across the vast seas to return with sincerity. You served in office for only three years, and the succession was interrupted for two generations. Reflecting upon this vassal territory, we had hoped you would receive manifold blessings and strive to establish excellent plans, but who could have expected that longevity would be so difficult to attain. News of your death reached us from afar, and we specially extend this commendation and condolence. Though the bestowal of rank did not reach you during your lifetime, the honor bestowed is truly abundant after your death. We hereby distribute this sacrificial ceremony and dispatch a special official to conduct it. Alas! The jade册 is transmitted from afar, hoping to console the aspirations of the departed king. The imperial edict extends its coverage, clearly demonstrating our sincere care for distant lands. We establish sacrificial offerings, hoping that your spirit will accept and descend.

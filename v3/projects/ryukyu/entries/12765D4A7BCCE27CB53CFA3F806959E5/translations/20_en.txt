Waiting for the proclamation official to finish reading in a composed manner, the interpreter official calls out "burn the silk offerings." The great-great-grandson leads all officials to rise and proceed to the silk-burning location. After waiting for the burning to be completed, they return to the open terrace, and together with the officials, perform the ritual of three kneelings and nine kowtows to express gratitude, then withdraw from formation. The great-great-grandson carries the spirit tablet of former king Sho Tei, enters the shrine through the eastern side gate, and places it on the eastern spirit seat. The great-great-grandson then carries the spirit tablet of former king Sho Eki and places it in position. The imperial envoy again takes the imperial sacrificial text for former king Sho Eki, hands it to the scroll-bearing official, and proceeds according to the previous ceremony.

Both imperial sacrificial texts are separately transcribed and the yellow copies burned, while the original imperial edicts are all requested to be kept and enshrined in the temple.

After the sacrificial ceremony is completed, the imperial envoy changes clothes, and the great-great-grandson escorts him with a bow to the eastern hall to perform the meeting ceremony. 《Marginal note: The great-great-grandson has not yet received investiture and still keeps to the curtained quarters. Only at this point does he first meet with the envoys. The seven banquets begin from this point. Zhang Xueli's record stating that there was a "Welcome Wind Banquet" upon first arrival is incorrect.》 The imperial envoy takes the eastern position, the great-great-grandson takes the western position, each performs three bows, and after being seated and served tea, they request to proceed to the front hall for a banquet. The imperial envoy proceeds on the left, the great-great-grandson on the right to reach the front hall. The imperial envoy sits in the eastern position, the great-great-grandson in the western position. The chief envoy sits in the eastern position, the deputy envoy in the western position, both facing south. The great-great-grandson sits facing northeast. No music is provided. Tea and wine are all personally offered, but the imperial envoy declines; the imperial envoy's reciprocal offerings are also declined. At the end of the banquet, the imperial envoy's palanquin is requested to proceed to before Tekisui. The great-great-grandson descends the steps to bid farewell with a bow, and the various officials exit the gate and kneel in farewell. On this day, the great-great-grandson does not have time to visit the guesthouse to express thanks, so he first sends an official to the guesthouse to express gratitude for their efforts. The next day, the imperial envoy also sends an official to enter the royal castle to express thanks for the banquet. This constitutes the first banquet.

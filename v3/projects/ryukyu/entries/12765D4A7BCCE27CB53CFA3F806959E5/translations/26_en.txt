In the ceremonial court, decorated pavilions are arranged on the left and right, and the Imperial Envoys take positions on either side of the Dragon Pavilion. The edict-bearing official and imperial decree-bearing official stand below the palace dais, while the proclamation reader stands below the reading platform.

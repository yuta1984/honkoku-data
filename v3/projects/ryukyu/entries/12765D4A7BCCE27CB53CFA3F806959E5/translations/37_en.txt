Mid-Autumn Banquet
In the courtyard of the royal palace, in front of the dripping water of the North Palace, a wooden platform was constructed. It was five to six zhang square, surrounded on four sides by curtains and screens. The king invited guests to enter and take their seats, and once everyone was seated, they first presented divine songs of celebration and praise. According to the explanatory text: "At the beginning of chaos in this country, the first to appear and rule the world was called the Tensōn clan, like China's Emperor Fuxi who governed with simplicity and tranquility. Thereafter, when national rulers ascended to the throne, the gods would appear each time to show divine protection. Thus, welcoming songs for the gods were created to celebrate this. In later times, the gods did not appear frequently, but the surviving melodies of the divine songs remain to this day. Whenever the king's enthronement and various celebratory events are held, they are always performed. Previously, after former kings received
imperial investiture, it was customary to perform this first when banqueting the imperial envoys." An old man appeared on stage, with no musical accompaniment, only chanting divine songs in worship and prayer.

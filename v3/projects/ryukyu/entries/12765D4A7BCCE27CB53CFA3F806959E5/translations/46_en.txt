He illuminates the standards according to ancient institutions, weaving military affairs which is indeed taking civil governance as the warp. Receiving the imperial mandate with increasing reverence, examining myself with greater dedication. Humbly considering that,

His Imperial Majesty's

Way surpasses that of Yao and Shun,

Virtue exceeds that of Tang and Wen,

Unifying the six directions while ruling with effortless governance, in teaching benevolence one must first teach filial piety,

Opening the nine-layered palace through ritual and ceremony, serving as ruler while also serving as teacher.

Your subject Kei has for generations guarded the feudal territory and supplied tribute duties through the ages.

Receiving the distant bestowal of the dragon seal, our shark islands shine with brilliance.

Blessed with the pursuing proclamation of the phoenix edict, our red pillars gain in splendor.

Before the imperial envoys I bow nine times,

Gazing toward the elephant towers I call out three times. I respectfully dispatch accompanying ministers Kō Ryūyoku, Tei Junsoku and others to reverently carry local products, humbly expressing my modest offerings. I humbly wish that,

The celestial movement never ceases,

Imperial grace becomes ever more sublime.

Uniting the royal assemblies to expand the realm, those who unite in script and measures number one thousand eight hundred kingdoms,

Divining heavenly timing and responding to the pitch pipes, may auspicious omens be verified in the thirty-six winds. Soon we shall witness the cultured qilin offering auspicious signs and the colorful phoenix arriving in ceremony.

Your subject Kei gazes upward with boundless devotion.

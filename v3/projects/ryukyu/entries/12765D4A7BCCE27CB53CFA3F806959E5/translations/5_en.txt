　　Arrival of the Investiture Ships at Port
The investiture ships arrived at Naha Port on the first day of the sixth month and anchored at the harbor mouth. Dozens of welcoming boats, dugout canoes with twin
sails numbering in the hundreds of oars, and the heir-great-grandson Sho Kei, the guardian prince, first dispatched legal officials and
other accompanying ministers to come and welcome them.
Following the imperial edict, they came and were dispatched in succession, several groups before and after, presenting livestock as gifts and welcoming with labor according to ritual. At the afternoon tide, the islanders
prepared hundreds of boats, some aboard ships, others entering the water, deploying hundreds of ropes to pull the boats to below the Geion Pavilion.
《Side note: The pavilion was built during the Hongwu era under King Buning, and was renovated to look like new》The accompanying ministers formed ranks, and ceremonial guards with golden drums all gathered to the left and right of the pavilion.

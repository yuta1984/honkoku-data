ornaments, wearing five-colored robes, with five-colored flower cords wrapped around their necks hanging long down below their knees as they appeared on stage. When the musicians sang, they removed the flower cords, joined hands, stamped their feet and moved to the rhythm as before, forming the second round of the "Flower Cord Dance."

Next, three young boys about ten years old, wearing pearl and jade flowers covering their heads, dressed in court skirts and five-colored brocade half-sleeves, each carrying a small flower basket on their shoulders, appeared on stage and stood in triangular formation. The musicians sang and stamped as before, forming the third round of the "Basket Dance." Next, four young children in short vermillion-green five-colored court robes and long skirts with colorful hems trailing on the ground swayed as they appeared on stage. They sat briefly facing the musicians, then the musicians handed each of them four small bamboo clappers. They rose to dance, keeping rhythm as their hand clappers responded, forming the fourth round of the "Clapper Dance."

Next were six warriors wearing black and white alternating patterned wide-sleeved short robes, with gold bands binding their foreheads in the style of flat-topped monk caps, wielding white staffs and striking them together in rhythm, forming the fifth round of the "Martial Dance." There were also two young boys in five-colored robes holding golden balls. On all four sides of the balls were attached small golden bells with long vermillion tasseled cords. They danced left and right, leading two blue lions onto the stage in spinning leaps, forming the sixth round of the "Ball Dance." When the seating ended and seats were changed, three more young boys in court costume appeared on stage and sat briefly facing the musicians. The musicians handed them two small golden flower sticks each, less than one chi in length, with red flowers attached at both ends. They struck them together in rhythm, forming the seventh round of the "Stick Dance." Next, four young boys changed into court robes and appeared on stage, each holding a flower rod about three chi long, dancing in rhythm to form the eighth round of the "Rod Dance." By this time it was approaching dusk, so they removed the curtains and set up dozens of fireworks stands in the courtyard.

They also had several people wear fire caps and ride mock horses, with smoke and explosions firing simultaneously from head to tail as they galloped around the courtyard for theatrical entertainment. When the banquet ended and they exited the castle, several thousand torch bearers about two zhang in length lined the road.

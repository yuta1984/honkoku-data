The Ceremonial Guard for the King of Chuzan's Visit to the Chinese Envoy's Residence

July 26th
Upon completion of the investiture ceremony, Sho Kei, great-great-grandson of the Chuzan lineage, first assumed the title of King of Chuzan and chose an auspicious day to announce this to the ancestral temple.

August 2nd, after receiving congratulations from the vassals and people of all islands in the kingdom, on the 9th day the King of Chuzan personally visited the Chinese envoy's residence to express his gratitude.

He returned after conducting the ceremony with magnificent investiture regalia and accompanied by court officials. When he first departed from the palace gate, he rode in a palanquin carried by sixteen men. After passing Chouko Bridge and reaching the south of the Confucian temple, he briefly stopped at a separate residence to change clothes and reduced the palanquin bearers by half before arriving at the envoy's residence. On his return, he again changed clothes at the separate residence, and the ceremonial procession proceeded as before back to the palace. What is observed now differs slightly from what was recorded by the previous envoy Wang Ji, so I briefly record it here.

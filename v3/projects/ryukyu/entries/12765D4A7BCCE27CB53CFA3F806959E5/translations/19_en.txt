Two imperial sacrificial texts are respectfully placed within the dragon pavilion, and additionally, gifts of two hundred bolts of silk and two hundred taels of silver are carried and respectfully placed within the decorated pavilion. After the various officials arrange themselves in formation and complete the ritual of three kneelings and nine kowtows, they proceed ahead to Anri Bridge. The great-great-grandson, wearing a black robe and square belt, leads the various officials to welcome and prostrate at the left side of the road at the bridge head.

When the dragon pavilion temporarily stops, the heir apparent and various officials rise to standing position, and the imperial envoy advances forward to stand separately on the left and right of the dragon pavilion. The interpreter official calls out "arrange formation," and the great-great-grandson leads the various officials in performing the ritual of three kneelings and nine kowtows. The great-great-grandson leads the various officials ahead to outside the shrine gates.

The dragon pavilion enters through the central gate and reaches the central hall of the shrine. The silver and silk from the decorated pavilion are arranged on the table in front of the former king's position. The imperial envoy follows and stands to the left and right. The scroll-bearing official enters through the eastern corner gate and stands facing west outside the eastern side gate of the shrine. The proclamation official and scroll-unfurling official enter through the western corner gate and stand facing east below the reading platform. Two incense attendants lift the incense table, place it in front of the dragon pavilion, and add incense. The great-great-grandson leads the various officials to enter through the eastern corner gate, ascend the open terrace, take their respective worship positions, and after completing the ritual of three kneelings and nine kowtows, they withdraw to stand below the former king's spirit position facing west. The scroll-bearing official enters the shrine's central hall from the eastern side gate. The imperial envoy first takes the imperial sacrificial text for former king Sho Tei, hands it to the scroll-bearing official to hold high, and has him ascend the reading platform from within the shrine. The proclamation official follows next, and the scroll-unfurling official follows after that. The scroll-bearing official ascends the platform and stands to the right of the table, the proclamation official takes the reading position, and the scroll-unfurling official stands to the left of the table, facing the scroll-bearing official for unfolding. When the interpreter official calls out "begin reading," the great-great-grandson and all officials prostrate below the former king's spirit position facing north.

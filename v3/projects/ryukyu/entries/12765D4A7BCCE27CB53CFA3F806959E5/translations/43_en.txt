Fan Dance (performed by six children) - one piece, Palm Rhythm Dance (performed by three children) - one piece, Hat Dance (performed by four children) - one piece, Flower Basket Dance (performed by three children) - one piece. All of the above are called "Songs of Great Peace."

The second was the ancient tale of the two children, Tsuru and Kame, avenging their father. When Nakagusuku Aji Mō Kokutei loyally and courageously served the country, Katsuren Aji Akō had become a county lord (royal son-in-law) in his youth, but despite his exalted position, he was arrogant and harbored treasonous intentions. He despised Nakagusuku, slandered him before the king, and falsely accused him of rebellion. The king ordered Akō to lead troops to exterminate the clan. Lord Mō committed suicide, leaving two sons - one named Tsuru, aged thirteen, and the other named Kame, aged twelve - both exceptionally talented. Their father had regularly taught them swordsmanship with two precious swords. At the time of the incident, they were staying with their mother at her family home in Sannan, at Sa Kokuyoshi's residence. Upon hearing of the tragedy, they wept and begged their mother to let them find an opportunity to kill Akō and avenge their father. They obtained the precious swords, each wearing one, and walked to Katsuren to spy on Akō. When Akō went on a spring outing, they approached with swords concealed. Akō, pleased and drunk, removed his sash and gave it to the two children, also carrying a sword which he presented to Tsuru. Tsuru took advantage of his drunken state, drew his sword and stabbed him, crying out loudly: "I am the son of Lord Mō! Now I kill you to avenge my father!" Akō started up in alarm, but his head fell with the sword. His retinue were all drunk and were entirely killed by the two children.

The third was the tale of the Bell Demon. In the farming family of the Tō surname in Ubagama Village, Nakagusuku County, there was a child named Matsuju, fifteen years old, fair-skinned and handsome. He went to Shuri to study under a teacher. One day, while traveling along a mountain path in Urasoe, as dusk fell and darkness came, he walked tapping the ground with a bamboo pole. Seeing a light, he sought lodging. It was a hunter's house where the father had gone out for night hunting, leaving only a daughter aged sixteen who was quite alluring. She provided lodging and tried to seduce him, but Matsuju merely sat and slept, refusing her advances. When she tried to forcibly embrace him, Matsuju brushed off his clothes and stood up. The woman, ashamed and angry, took up hunting implements intending to kill Matsuju. Matsuju fled and the woman pursued him. Around a bend in the mountain was Manjuji Temple, where the head priest Futoku resided.

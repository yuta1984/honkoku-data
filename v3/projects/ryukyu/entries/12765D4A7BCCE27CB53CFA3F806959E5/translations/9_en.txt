Now, examining the historical records, we use one approach to establish the years of envoy dispatches. For missions since the Hongwu era that did not involve investiture ceremonies, the names cannot be fully researched, so they are not listed together. Investiture envoys were customarily filled by officials of the rank of 行人 (xingren). During the Zhengtong era of the Ming, they first began using 給事中 (jishizhong) for this purpose, with principal and vice envoys continuing this practice, which remained unchanged thereafter. The use of Hanlin and Secretariat personnel began with the previous envoys. Both envoys were historiographer officials, except for this particular mission.

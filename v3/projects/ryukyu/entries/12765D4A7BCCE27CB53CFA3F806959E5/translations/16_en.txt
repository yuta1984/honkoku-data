Tianfei was from the Lin clan of Putian. Those with the surname Lin in Fujian often use this designation. Above the beam is a plaque reading "Shrine of the Spiritually Responsive and Universally Benevolent Deity," which was erected by the investiture envoys Xia Ziyang and Wang Shizhen during the Wanli era.

On the second day after arriving at the guesthouse, the envoys first visit the Confucian temple to offer incense, then proceed to the Tianfei Temple. On the winter solstice, a Ten Thousand Years Dragon Pavilion is set up in the Minglun Hall to the left of the temple, and the envoys perform ceremonies in order. After this is completed, they also pay respects to the image of Confucius. This is not done on the new moon and full moon days.

The Tianzun Temple enshrines Leisheng Puhua Tianzun (Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Heavenly Lord). According to Wang's record, during the Yongle era, tribute envoys brought back a sculpted image from the capital, and prayers are always answered, so on the second day the envoys also go there to offer incense. They do not visit again on new moon and full moon days.

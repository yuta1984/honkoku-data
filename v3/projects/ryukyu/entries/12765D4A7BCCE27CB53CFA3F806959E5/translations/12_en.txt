The Record of Sixi Pavilion states: "In the Ryukyu Imperial Envoy Residence, upon entering through the gate there is a main hall of three bays, and from the main hall one proceeds to the study of three bays. I resided in the east, and Master Li Jichun resided in the west. Behind the rooms there are another three bays where the official attendants reside. Both sides are flanked by corridor rooms of six bays each, where the clerks, palanquin bearers, and servants lodge. During the hot months when the heat was oppressive, the Ryukyu people divined an empty space behind the rear wall for me, built up earth and tiles with thatch, erected pillars and made it into a pavilion. I therefore inscribed it 'Sixi' (Resting Thoughts), composing poems and songs there, hoping to forget that I was in a foreign land."

The hall of the Imperial Envoy Residence was formerly named "Sailu" (Sprinkling Dew). In the fourth year of Wanli, investiture envoy Xiao Chongye wrote a "Record of Sailu Hall," saying: "The embassy originally had a plaque but it was not properly designated. The Tang people say 'Ten thousand li across the eastern sea, sprinkling the land of Fusang' - the meaning lies in embracing the distant. I name it with 'Sailu.'" Vice-envoy Xie Jie's record states: "Sailu Hall is the hall of the Imperial Envoy Residence. This is what Remonstrance Official Envoy Xiao named this hall."

Minister Baoguang notes: These two records should belong to the old embassy. Now the plaques have deteriorated and the pavilion has collapsed, making verification impossible. Based on Guo's record stating "entering through the gate to a main hall of three bays," it is clear that inside the main gate of the current old courtyard is immediately the main hall with no ceremonial gate.

At the Imperial Envoy Residence, daily there is one chief interpreter and twenty red-sashed scholars who take turns on duty at the gate, awaiting instructions.

The support services beside the Imperial Envoy Residence are divided into seven offices: First, the Residence Affairs Office, which manages all major and minor matters requiring action within the residence. Second, the Reception Office, which manages repairs, furnishings, and household items for the residence. Third, the Livestock Office, which manages the provision of sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, etc. Fourth, the Supply Office, which manages wine and rice for the residence.

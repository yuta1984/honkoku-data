[The lower half of the right page is a diagram] Unten Port

It faces the sea. It is about twenty-two ri and ten chō from Naha.

Mount Oppa is south of Tamagusuku Village, at the border between the two magiri of Nago and Motobu. Trees grow densely there.

The Ōi River originates in the mountains of Izumi Village in Motobu magiri, flows north in meandering curves, and empties into Te Port.

There is a bay in Nakazonene Village called Te Port. Because the bottom is shallow and the waves are high, large ships cannot be moored there.

Unten Port is located in Unten Village at the northeastern corner of this magiri. It can accommodate several dozen large ships. It is a natural good harbor. During the Eiman period (1165-1166), Minamoto no Tametomo entrusted his fate to heaven and drifted ashore here. This is the origin of the port's name.

Kouri Island is located in the sea about twenty chō from Unten Port. Its circumference is about one ri and twenty-six chō.

Above Unten Port is Mount Hyakuanji-baka. There are many skulls on the mountainside. This is called Hyakuanji-baka (Tomb of a Hundred Lords). This is the origin of the mountain's name.

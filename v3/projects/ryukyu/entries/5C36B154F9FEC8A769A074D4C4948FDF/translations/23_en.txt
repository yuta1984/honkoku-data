The chief envoy Prince Misato came and received the ceremonial box. Hearing from afar of the beginning of the new reign, we immediately presented tribute goods as congratulations. There were special imperial instructions, and the ceremonial treatment exceeded the usual protocol. This is truly the honor and good fortune of our worthy domain.

The bestowed gifts are as listed in the catalog, and have been sent back with the returning envoys. The details of these matters are in the report to the Satsuma Lieutenant General. We are truly in awe and inadequately prepared.

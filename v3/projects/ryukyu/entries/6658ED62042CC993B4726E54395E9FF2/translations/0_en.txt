I write to inform you. Regarding the matter of the successor to Sanshikan Oroku-ueekata that I reported to you, I have received and understood your letter indicating that you have informed the Sessho-Sanshikan that Zakimi-ueekata has been appointed to this position. When I immediately conveyed this appointment, he accepted and has begun his duties. Please kindly relay this matter accordingly.
With utmost respect and humility.

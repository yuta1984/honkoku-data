Purple waves, polar star, in the midst of morning majesty, coming from ten thousand ri to the east
When presenting tribute, do not mock the barbarian land; though still foolish, their clothing
And caps still preserve the ceremonies of Han officials
Through Kyushu's hundred transformations, legal traditions vanished, yet this isolated island still can
Display ancient customs; though the topknots and blue court dress may seem crude customs, the former
Kings' music and dance remain within them

published it. This year, in the Kanoe-inu year (Kaei 3, 1850) in early winter, the King of Chuzan again sent Prince Tamagawa as an envoy to present tribute goods and express gratitude for the grace of investiture. Therefore, I took the previous book, supplemented what was missing, gathered what had been omitted, and prepared to republish it. Yamazaki Hokuhō served as editor, and Hokuhō is an old friend of mine who is broadly versed in ancient and modern matters and most knowledgeable about national customs and precedents. Now, with his assistance, this book has been completed - is this not my greatest fortune?

During the Keichō period, in our Ōshū Iwaki domain, there was a Buddhist priest named Fukurochū who once went to Ryukyu and eventually sought to board a foreign ship to enter Tang-shan (China). The foreigners were wary of this and sternly refused, not granting permission. Fukurochū therefore remained in Ryukyu, became close friends with the gentleman Ba Kōmei, and moved to reside at Keirin Temple in Shuri Castle town. For Kōmei, he wrote the "Ryukyu Shintō Ki" to record the rise and fall of that kingdom's founding. He also modeled after the local "Teikin Ōrai" instructional texts and wrote "Ryukyu Ōrai" for the convenience of children's education. Both monks and laypeople admired him and kept him from returning for three years before he finally came home.

Ah! Fukurochū, as a humble wanderer with modest abilities, braved the waves and overcame extreme dangers, moving about among the isolated islands of the distant seas, causing the people there to joyfully submit and serve without end. Though this was due to the height of his virtue and reputation, it also cannot be said not to have been caused by the lingering influence of our imperial country. I was born in peaceful times and do not dare to sail across dangerous waters, yet I can observe the ceremonies of Chuzan in the immediate vicinity of the imperial capital, sharing the same kind of reception as Fukurochū but with different hardships. This too is a great fortune.

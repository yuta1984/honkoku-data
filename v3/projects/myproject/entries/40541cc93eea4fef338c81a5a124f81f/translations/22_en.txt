there was no such support, so when any incident arose, she felt all the more helpless and anxious.

The First Prince was born to the Right Minister's Imperial Consort, regarded by the world as the undoubted heir apparent, but he could not compare to this child's radiance.

As countless painful experiences accumulated, she fell into deep distress. The emperor, seeing this as increasingly pitiable, moved the court lady who had originally resided in the Kōryōden to other quarters and granted her the upper chambers. The resentment this caused had no outlet. In the year this prince turned three, for his hakama ceremony, the emperor spared no expense from the imperial treasury, rivaling what had been done for the First Prince. This only increased the world's criticism, yet as the prince grew, his appearance and character proved extraordinary and wondrous.

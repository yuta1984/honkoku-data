There are no hakama fabric weavers at all, and there are no goods brought out at Ashikaga market either. Clothing items are also following suit and have become very expensive. For raw silk, the Jōshū local rounds have reached 36-37 monme. Summer goods will likely become even more expensive. Please consider this carefully.

Since there has been no rain at all from this spring, there is no water anywhere, and we are only dealing with well-cleaning every day. At places like Iwazen, for soy sauce brewing, they now send people daily to fetch water from Ochanomizu below Gionji temple, and it costs over 1 kan mon for everyone. In the Shimomachi and Shinmachi areas, they fetch water from the Nakagawa river at Hosoya, so the area in front of the Hosoya checkpoint is very bustling every day. Although they want to gradually start preparing rice seedbeds, since the mountain springs have dried up, they are not starting work at this time.

At this time, raw white cotton cloth around Kasama costs about 2 bu per tan, which is an extraordinarily high price rarely seen in history.
For the high-loom weavers in the upper and lower towns, until two or three days ago the markup was about 37-38 bu per tan, but from yesterday it suddenly rose to 43-44 monme. This is because cotton is trading at high prices.

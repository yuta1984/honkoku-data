There are also imperial edicts on this matter, so we wish to make this even more thorough. Regarding this, even daily necessities made of bronze and iron shall be discontinued from now on, and all such items in our possession shall be removed and promptly recast into cannons. The bronze and iron lanterns at both mountains, Momijiyama and others, shall also be gradually recast into artillery. Everyone should make extraordinary efforts to ensure military preparations are properly completed.

Fifth month

Fifth month, 12th day - Official proclamation in the domain's towns:
Recently, masterless samurai have been roaming through this domain as well, borrowing the pretext of expelling foreigners to make unreasonable demands on wealthy families and greedily extorting money, committing disorderly acts. This is extremely problematic. As previously communicated, during the Shogun's absence for his journey to Kyoto, the responsibility for maintaining order has been entrusted to our house. If we fail to maintain proper control, we cannot justify ourselves to the government, which is a matter of great concern. Therefore, regarding such individuals, they should be captured without mercy and reported. If they resist arrest, it is acceptable to strike them down.

14th day: Morning mist falls. Clear weather.

Even at high prices, there seems to be no hindrance whatsoever, and regardless of price, all kinds of goods are flowing up to the Kamigata region, so in Edo there are no various goods available and all merchants are in great distress. For textiles and cotton goods, there are absolutely no products available. Moreover, since the wives of the great daimyo are gradually returning to Edo, even when they wish to purchase textiles, there are no goods available, and even major stores like Daimaru and Echigoya are said to be in great distress.

When I sent people to purchase white cotton from around Kasama to Shimodate and Moka areas, there was absolutely none available at this time, with prices at about 2 tan per ryō and no goods available. They barely managed to purchase 6 tan and returned. This is truly an unusual situation. At this time, they say cotton thread is being sent to the Jōshū area and sells for 1 kan 500 mon. They say it's all becoming cotton crepe, so it's better to sell as thread rather than weaving it into white cotton. Around Shimodate and Yūki, brown rice is 5 to 4-5 shō per 5 to.

In the Mito domain territory, the export of cotton and cotton thread to other places has been prohibited. Cotton is about 1 kan 500 me per ryō, while in other places it's about 1 kan 350 me.

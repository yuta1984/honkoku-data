Regarding the matter of commodity prices, although we have received assistance many times, prices have been rising steadily, and in recent years the common people have been particularly suffering, causing deep concern. Now, in Kyoto as well, strong directives have been issued, so we earnestly hope that the intentions will be thoroughly carried out. Accordingly, there will be various measures taken, so even the lowest-ranking people should not misunderstand and should work to bring down commodity prices. If anyone is led astray by personal profit and engages in improper conduct without regard for the people's hardships, they shall certainly be severely punished.

On the 8th day of the 5th month, Iseya Riemon from Kyoto departed.

First, as we are approaching the season for new flowers, I believe the crop conditions are likely favorable. If you are purchasing safflowers, please give us your instructions by all means. We will work diligently in selling. I humbly request your consideration in this matter.

Second, regarding His Excellency the Shogun, after staying away for a very long time, he departed yesterday on the 7th, stayed in Osaka, and returned to Edo by steamship. Truly, the frequent trips to Kyoto in recent times are cause for reverence. The various daimyo lords have each returned to their home domains, while Lord Hitotsubashi remains in Kyoto, which is also cause for reverence. This is entirely the foundation of peace throughout the realm, and we share in this joy.

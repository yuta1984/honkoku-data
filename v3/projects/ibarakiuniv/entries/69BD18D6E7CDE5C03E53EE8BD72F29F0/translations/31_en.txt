Two or three days ago at Inayoshi-juku, the son of a doctor residing in Hatta was killed by sword, and a messenger was dispatched from here regarding this matter.

Regarding the two-shu gold coins minted during the Tempō era, their circulation will be stopped by future proclamation, so those who possess them should quickly exchange and submit them. As compensation for this, thirty ryō of gold per hundred ryō will be given to the holders. They should quickly submit them to the Gold Inspection Office and to those in Kyoto, Osaka, and other places who handle various exchange duties for prompt exchange.

Regarding the above matter, for imperial lands, the administrators, domain lords, and local lords should issue notices ensuring no omissions.

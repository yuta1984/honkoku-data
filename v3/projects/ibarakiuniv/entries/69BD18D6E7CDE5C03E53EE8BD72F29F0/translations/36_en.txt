...they have been granted leave and have respectively returned to the eastern provinces. For now things are peaceful, so please be at ease. However, the Shogun is still in Kyoto. When he will depart is not yet known.

One item: Regarding safflower trading here, after what I reported in early spring, I expected there would be transactions during spring, but there have been none at all. This is because since last winter, silk crepe cotton has been expensive, making dyeing operations extremely difficult. Originally, domestic safflower did not have large cargo volumes last year either, but due to the severe shortage of dyed goods, prices have not risen. This has truly been an unfortunate continuation of poor business recently. Lately, even remaining flowers appear quite abundant. Please judge the current market conditions from what I reported in early spring.

One item: Regarding new flower sprouting in nearby provinces, they say that the production in Kii, Yamato, and Yamashiro provinces should be similar to last year. Reports continue to arrive that growth is proceeding without problems. Please give this matter your wise consideration.

One item: As for Chinese flowers, there have been large imports recently, and particularly from last winter to this spring, large cargo volumes have appeared. This has affected the overall market for Japanese safflower, causing difficulties. Regarding this matter, unless you purchase this year's new flowers at exceptionally low prices, it will be very difficult to make it profitable. Please give careful consideration to the above circumstances...

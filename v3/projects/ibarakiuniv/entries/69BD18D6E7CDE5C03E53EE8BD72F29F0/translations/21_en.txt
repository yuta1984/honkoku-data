Regarding textiles, cotton goods, and other various products that are normally shipped down from Edo wholesalers for purchase - since products have become scarce in Edo at this time, buyers have come down and are collecting goods. Under these circumstances, if we sell to such people, prices of all goods in this area will rise even higher, causing hardship to all people. Therefore, we should not sell to such people, but exercise careful judgment and, with each party keeping their position in mind, handle transactions only after consultation depending on the goods, so that people do not suffer hardship. The above directive shall be issued.

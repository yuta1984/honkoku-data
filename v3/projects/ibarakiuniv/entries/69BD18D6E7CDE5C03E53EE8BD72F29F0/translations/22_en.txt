Wheat rice: 7 to per ryo
Barley seed: very expensive {{Old stock from last year: 4 to, 5-6 sho cheaper}}

Cotton thread is extremely expensive - even elderly people and children who spin thread can make about 150 mon profit even after deducting cotton costs, so no one is going out for employment. Those who weave on high looms can make a profit of about 600-700 mon per tan at this time, so it appears that everyone from back-alley small traders to others are all weaving on high looms. However, high looms are also very expensive at 44-45 monme per tan, and scrap iron prices have also risen recently to about 500 mon per kanme.

Currently, cotton thread costs about 11-12 monme per 100 mon.

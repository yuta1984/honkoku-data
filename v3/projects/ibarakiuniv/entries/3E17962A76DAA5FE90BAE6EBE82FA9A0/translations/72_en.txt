20th day
Rumor that the government rōjū (senior councilors) Ōta Bitchū-no-kami and Manabe Echizen-no-kami have been summoned and given instructions

From Nakanoya Man'emon of Yokoyama-chō to Mukōshō:
1. This time three French ships have arrived off Shinagawa. Daily reports are being made to the magistrate's residence in Bakurō-chō. Foreign barbarians from various countries have heard about this and are coming one after another. If they continue to arrive like this, the city will become even more depressed economically, and we are truly at a loss as to what to do. Just when we had felt relieved after America and others had sailed back home, if they come sailing in again like this, there will be no end to it. People cannot settle down, and we are truly troubled by this situation.

1. Today, the 18th day, at the late snake hour (around 11 AM)
His Lordship the Shōgun's coffin departed and entered Ueno, so strict orders were issued regarding fire prevention in the city, and the gates along the main streets were closed off.

《Marginal note: otoshi no ue de gozarimasu》　　　Santō Kyōzan-ō

Among the great many who were afflicted by this epidemic disease and became guests of the underworld, I record the names of people renowned throughout the land, and in doing so, I string together playful verses mourning my acquaintances, singing them as a modest six-character offering.

Mourning Beian
In overwhelming grief, rubbing one's eyes with ink, the brush's
life-hair has been severed in its traces

Mourning Senyryū  
Even the willows whose eyes are wiped by spring winds each year—
if someone scatters them, the moon too would find no place to dwell

Mourning Tokukabura
Though I prayed "Let there be Fukushibai Tokukabura," the inconstant wind
blows and weaves this song

Mourning Tanesada
Even after falling in the autumn wind, one would still cherish
the sweet persimmon's seed-source that served as a walking stick

Mourning Rakutei
The old man of winter mounts his leisurely steed and rides to the western capital

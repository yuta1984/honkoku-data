There are those who wish to do so, and while the feelings between lord and retainer are 
quite natural, this time it is essential that the domain be kept peaceful above all else,
as this is the first priority for His Lordship's benefit.
Both lords are also giving this matter consideration, so the head of house as well as his sons and disciples
should be informed down to the lowest levels of administration to ensure there are no misunderstandings.
　　　Memorandum of oral instruction
　Since the domain crisis of Kinoe-tatsu year, it has become customary to attach various factional 
　labels to each other, and nowadays even water transport to Edo is conducted under the names of "loyal" and "traitorous,"
　and even ordinary meetings and consultations are divided by distinctions of "right" and "wrong."
　Not only the retainer families but also minor officials, temple and shrine personnel, and townspeople 
　down to the common people have split into factions, which raises concerns about the future.
　Therefore, the order has been given to cease using such factional labels.
　Guard the intent of His Lordship's consideration,
　and ensure that each person in their position takes great care not to displease His Lordship's wishes,
　and handle matters so that this reaches down to all levels of administration.

However much trouble this may cause,
　　without completing the report to the Imperial Court, it would be difficult to take measures.
　　However, suddenly opening hostilities and, by any chance, following in the
　　disastrous footsteps of Qing China would be an intolerable matter.
　　Therefore, Inoue Shinano-no-kami and Iwase Higo-no-kami signed at Kanagawa
　　and handed it over to the envoy. Given the truly unavoidable circumstances,
　　such measures were taken, but
　　the Imperial Court's concerns are indeed most reasonable,
　　so hereafter the control measures and coastal defenses should be fully
　　strengthened to put the
　　Imperial mind at ease.
　　This is respectfully submitted. Regarding this matter, an urgent relay message
　　was sent to Kyoto, and detailed matters will be
　　communicated gradually. Should there be any thoughts regarding
　　future measures, they should be communicated without reserve.

　On the 23rd day, Rōjū Hotta-sama was relieved of his duties, Ōta Jijū Dōjun-sama
　resumed his position as Rōjū, Matsudaira Izumi-no-kami-sama, Kuze Yamato-no-kami-sama, and
　Naitō Kii-no-kami-sama as Nishi-no-maru Rōjū, Wakisaka Nakatsukasa-no-taifu-sama and Manabe
　Shimōsa-no-kami-sama as Wakadoshiyori, Honda Etchū-no-kami-sama and Endō Tajima-no-kami

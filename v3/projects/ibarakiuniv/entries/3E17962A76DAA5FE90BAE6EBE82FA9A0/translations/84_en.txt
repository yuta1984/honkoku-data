voice goes forth and shall not return

Mourning Hiroshige
The scenery of paradise he would suddenly paint—even after
disappearing like a faint ink shadow

Mourning Kobashi (sic)
Bearing the dew that settles on rice stalks, becoming
a pleasure quarter sparrow fluttering in the wing-wind

Mourning Hankyu
Reading kana letters on the journey road of "Hizakurige"—how
painful to think of the deceased master's traces

Mourning Futaba
The two leaves of the five-needle pine have scattered and vanished,
even the kamuro who called for greenery weeps

Mourning Kunisato
The Tachikawa waters run dry and parched, while in Utagawa
the rain of tears surely increases all the more

Mourning Saiji
Mixing even the yakusha taiko drums with the music,
a dharma performance on the lotus dais

Mourning Kametohi

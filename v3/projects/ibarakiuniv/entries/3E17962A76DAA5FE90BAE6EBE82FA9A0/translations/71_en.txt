I thought that in this area there were numerous deaths and sick people from cholera in each household, so when I went via Gyōtoku-dōri, I encountered countless funeral processions along the way. Gradually hearing about the situation, within one to two hours people would vomit and have diarrhea, or vomit blood and die. Those who suffered for two days would recover safely. At Ryōgoku Bridge, there are a hundred funeral processions per day, so they wash the bridge boards. Nowadays they wash about twice a day. It's more frightening than any story, so after staying one day in Edo, he returned home without accomplishing his business. The epidemic spread from the Kamigata region, flowing from late June through July in Kamigata. At this time it's a major epidemic along the Tōkaidō route.

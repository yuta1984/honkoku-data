Safflowers - Report from Iseya Riemon of Kyoto, dated April 28th
Since early spring, business has been consistently poor with virtually no commerce. Recently
prices have dropped by about 20 ryo, truly unprecedented in recent years. At present
everything shows unexpected losses. Even now there are unexpectedly
many remaining flowers, making it difficult to close positions. Current market prices are roughly as follows:

Early harvest《Side note: 65 ryo, 50 ryo》 Mito《Side note: 62 ryo, 48 ryo》
Nansen《Side note: 65 ryo, 55 ryo》 《Side note: Okusen 52 ryo, Nambu 40 ryo》
Mogami《Side note: 55 ryo, 36 ryo》
　　Total remaining flowers about 600 bundles

Recently increasing every year, commerce should begin soon. Starting with Kishu and Yamato,
neighboring provinces are coordinating and considerable cargo volume should be produced. Last year, early Niwa and Mito
had decent yields, while Mogami and Sendai had poor yields, causing profit and loss
fluctuations in commerce. Recently, procurement has become extremely difficult.
Please give this matter careful consideration and arrange procurement at especially low prices.

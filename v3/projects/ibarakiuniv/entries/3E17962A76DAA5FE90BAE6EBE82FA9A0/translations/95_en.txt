Events from two or three days ago:
Claiming to be court nobles, they traveled by palanquin and horse, proceeding from the Washiko area through Hinokisawa and Iitomi with relay arrangements, then went to Iwai-machi, went up to Komatsuya inn and had courtesans brought up, whereupon they were arrested.
From the Utsunomiya area through Shirakawa area and Karasuyama, at various rural locations they made connections and went to Mito. The group of five or six people calling themselves court nobles consisted of men around forty years old who applied light makeup, wore black habutae silk kosode, traveled by palanquin on foot, and sent advance notice of their arrival. The one who became a court noble was the child of a Shinto priest from Enshu province, and his entourage was a gathering of mountain priests from the battlefield area and others.

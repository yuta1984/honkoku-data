On the 4th of this month, a fire broke out on Matsubara Street in Kyoto, burning down Higashi Hongan-ji temple, with all treasure houses and storehouses destroyed. The area was about 12-13 chō wide and 7-8 chō long. Higashi Hongan-ji had just completed its reconstruction work about 4-5 years ago. Nishi Hongan-ji remained as it was from old times and was not damaged by the spreading fire.

On the 6th of this month in Edo, from dawn at the 6th hour until evening, there was an unprecedented great thunderstorm. Lightning struck 17-18 places near the Koishikawa residence. Two ladies-in-waiting of Lord Sanshū died, and the chief retainer of Lord Daigaku also died. In the Fukagawa area, dozens of places were struck. From what I have heard subsequently, there were quite a few incidents. People finally regained their composure in the evening.

Again, about five American ships have arrived at Uraga.

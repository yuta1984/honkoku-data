This year there has been continuous poor fishing, but at the beginning of this month there was reported to be some fishing around Choshi and Kujukuri, so we sent people there. They processed 16-17 bundles, but at 1 ryo 9 bu 5 rin per unit, even 3.5 bales of dried sardines would not be profitable, so they went to Edo. Although market prices have not yet been established, there is a shortage of goods everywhere and they are just watching price trends.

Herring meal arrived at the port. Due to the shortage of sardine meal, herring meal in bales weighing 27-28 kan costs about 2 ryo per bale.

Rice: 1 bu 3 to 2 sho

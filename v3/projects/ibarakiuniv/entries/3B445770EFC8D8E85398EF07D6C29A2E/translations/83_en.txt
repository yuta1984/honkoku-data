ri tatsu (continued from previous page)

Regarding this wind disaster, Kaneko Magotar was summoned,
and both lords personally inquired into the matter, hearing detailed reports.
Although the domain's finances are extremely strained at this time,
out of noble consideration to provide relief aid multiple times over
for the hardships of the domain's people, an official notice has been issued as per the separate document.
This is truly an awesome and gracious imperial will.
Therefore, everyone should deeply understand this benevolence,
build their houses with peace of mind,
and make it their duty to repay the domain's favor for this noble consideration for generations to come.

This wind disaster affected the entire Edo area.
Although there was considerable damage starting with the lord's residence,
out of deep concern for the people's hardships,
you were summoned to personally inquire about conditions throughout the domain.
While there is a desire to provide relief aid multiple times over for their suffering,
due to the enormous expenses of recent years, the domain's finances
are extremely strained at this time, making it impossible to provide
aid to the extent that is desired.
Therefore, even the renovation of
the inner chambers
and sleeping quarters has been postponed, and with these small savings
it is desired to provide relief to the domain people who suffered from the wind disaster.

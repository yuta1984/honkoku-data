One　　　　　　　　　　　　Ota Tamba-no-kami
When you served in official capacity in previous years, you engaged in conduct that alienated His Lordship's filial devotion and showed disrespectful and unloyal behavior toward your superiors. Furthermore, regarding domain administration matters, there were occasions when directives came from the bakufu or notifications were conveyed by the senior councilors, yet at such times you used false arguments to deflect them, concealing the proper delivery of intentions, and other charges including spreading unreliable false statements and rumors, conducting appointments and dismissals with rewards and punishments, greedily accepting bribes, and engaging in improper dealings. Not only this, but even after being removed from official duties, you harbored intentions to be reinstated as before and engaged in various schemes to this end. Such conduct that darkens His Lordship's future prospects is extremely unruly. However, in consideration of your family lineage and through magnanimous imperial benevolence, you are ordered into retirement, and one thousand koku is granted to your son Senkichi. You must conduct yourself with restraint.

[Continuing from the previous case of Fujita Shuzen] He engaged in duplicitous words and actions toward his lord, harbored dark intentions, and caused serious national difficulties. Given that he had been granted high hereditary stipends for generations and received great benevolence, such conduct was extremely inexcusable. Though severe punishment would have been warranted had he lived, upon his death, through magnanimous benevolence, 300 koku are confiscated from your inherited domain, 500 koku are granted, your official duties are dismissed, and you are admitted to the senior retainer class. You should be grateful and ensure there are no misunderstandings in conduct, as has been proclaimed.

One　　　　　　　　　　　　Oyama Koshiro
In previous years when Yuki Torakotobuki engaged in treacherous and unreasonable conduct and was placed under custody, your agreement with Torakotobuki was not clearly evident. At that time, through magnanimous benevolence, no official judgment was rendered against you. However, you have shown no repentance since then, and reports continue of increasingly inexcusable conduct. Given that you have received high hereditary stipends for generations and great benevolence, such misconduct is particularly inappropriate and extremely careless for one in your position. Though severe punishment would be warranted, in consideration of your family lineage and through imperial mercy, 200 koku are confiscated from your inherited domain, 500 koku are granted, and you are ordered into retirement, as has been proclaimed.

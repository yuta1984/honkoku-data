In previous years he conspired with Yuki Torakotobuki, creating a serious national crisis, and though his crime was not light, at that time lenient judgment was passed. However, he has shown no repentance to this day, and during his period of restraint, without fearing his superiors, he secretly maintained contact with his faction members and gradually engaged in covert evil conduct. For one who had been ordered to strict restraint, this is extremely insubordinate, and though he should be sentenced to death, by merciful pardon he is ordered to enter the temporary prison.

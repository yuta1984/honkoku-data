Direct written message received:
To the Eshui family retainers:
Regarding the treacherous men such as Yuki Torakotsu who have for years carried out evil schemes and deceived both high and low ranks - we were once deceived by their faction this spring, but now deeply regret it. Since these are people who deceive even their lord through various schemes, if even one person among the retainers, farmers, and townspeople were to agree with them anywhere in the domain, it would be a fearful matter not only toward the government authorities but also toward our successive generations of ancestors. Therefore, we cannot leave this matter as it is, and as we have repeatedly communicated, they must reform their hearts and devote themselves to loyalty, filial piety, and literary and martial arts.
7th month, 11th day of the Dragon year [Seal]
Postscript: For farmers and townspeople, the meaning of this message should be made known through their supervisory heads.

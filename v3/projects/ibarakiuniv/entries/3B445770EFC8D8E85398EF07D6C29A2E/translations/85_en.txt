Communication from the Nagasaki Magistrate:
Regarding the procedures for receiving British envoy ships upon their arrival, although instructions have been communicated previously, we hear that this time they seem to have strong intentions regarding trade matters, and this affair appears to be of no ordinary nature. Therefore, officials for reception must certainly be dispatched from the capital. Moreover, regarding trade matters, given the current circumstances with various countries and the inevitable nature of the times, there will surely be some policy decision. With this understanding, the envoy ships should by all means be detained at that location, and reports on the reception situation should be sent promptly. In that case, reception officials should be dispatched immediately.

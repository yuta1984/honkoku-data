Proposal (Collapsed houses | Temporary exposure outdoors | Under the beams | Immediate white coffins | Sold out | Rich people's travels | Pawnshops' great losses | Craftsmen's windfall | Business hardship)
Outside (Government relief benevolent policy | Poor people's joy | World renewal | Gradual prosperity | Rice elder's publication banned)

Kasen Banzairaku　　　　　Ichiyuri
Somehow it has become lonely, northern winter shower　　Gradually
　No visitors come, alone I open the hearth　　Bent house
Finally repairing the damaged places　　Rental shop
　Even plasterers charge two bu for labor　　At that time
From next door moonlight shines through the bright window　　Wall collapsed
　Even the poetry teacher gets wet with dew　　Sleeping outdoors
Proverb teeth with sweet red bean soup this season　　Small earthquake
　Scary stories, dig to the roots to hear　　Strange happenings
Skeletons loaded on carts, a picture of hell　　Before one's eyes
　Mount Tate must be so lively　　Quite reasonable
Thin ice freezes harder as it moves north　　Direction
　Even the elderly wait for spring　　This winter's end
Lightly pickled vegetables sold by night work in moonlight　　Rotten market
　In the relief huts, voices of insects　　Inconvenient
Rich people's travels accompanied by sumo wrestlers　　Reputation seeking
　Samurai families troubled by cheap rice　　Downfall
Truly, flowers are cherry blossoms as people also tread　　Reputation

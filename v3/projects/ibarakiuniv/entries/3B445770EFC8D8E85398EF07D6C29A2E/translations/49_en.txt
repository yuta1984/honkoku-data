It then pushed toward the city center, but many people came out from the town and similarly drove it away, whereupon it turned back and pushed from the direction of Ryūgasaki toward Aba. Along the path it took, there were many collapsed and damaged houses. At that time there was great thunder, heavy rain, and strong wind, with exceptionally strong lightning striking in various places. I heard this today from a messenger of the dyer Rihei from Kamisakai village. This person happened to be in Tsuchiura and witnessed the tornado. He said the black clouds swirled about with great thunder and heavy rain in a truly frightening manner.

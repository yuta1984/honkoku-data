On the night of the 25th of this month, around the 5th and half hour, southeast winds began to blow, and with thunder and rain it became a great wind. That night in the Nihonbashi area, roof tiles and wooden shingles were blown away in such a great storm that fires broke out in four or five locations. Due to this, on the morning of the 26th, when I went out toward Kyōbashi, the four directions around Shinmei-mae Jūchō were also burned, and the fortune-teller Ishiryū's place was half-burned. At Kanasugi, two large Satsuma ships (55 ken long and over 40 ken long respectively) used for procurement were blown ashore. A large Chinese-style ship built under the patronage of the Mito domain suffered the same fate. Eitai Bridge collapsed, and both sides of Fukagawa Hachiman-dōri on the south side were destroyed - that location now uses ferry boats for passage. There were also deaths at the coastal batteries. All the new construction sites in Yoshiwara burned down. In Edo's city districts, eight or nine houses per neighborhood were destroyed, about ten houses from Yokkaichi's government warehouse were destroyed, and almost all the fire watchtowers throughout Edo were destroyed. There were several shipwrecks, reported to be about 480 vessels from Sekijuku. Shipping agents sent circular notices to trading shops, asking them to go around and dispatch help to the locations of shipwrecks - this has been continuous, truly an extraordinary situation. I wonder how things are in your home province - I am extremely worried. Earlier, when Iseya Hikoemon came to the capital, I heard from him that the Tsuchiura area, unlike Edo, did not suffer much destruction.

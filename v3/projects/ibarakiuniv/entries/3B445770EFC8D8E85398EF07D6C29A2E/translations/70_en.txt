Twenty-one [trees], and there were also places where temporary long houses collapsed. Regarding my residence, the fences and roof were completely blown away, and father and son stood vigil through the rainy night. It was truly a hardship. The upper house of the Inner Palace Hon-ma collapsed, about 150 tsubo in area. Indeed, everything suffered great damage, which I consider most alarming. Regarding the mansion's enclosures, from the front gate through Kasuga-cho street, turning around from Kaneda Gate to the entrance corner gate, from below Ushi Tenjin to the boat landing, all were completed in one day on the 26th. Truly, the work was carried out with remarkable efficiency.

This was from the night of August 25th, Ansei 3 (1856), from the hour of the Monkey and a half, when the southeast wind became severe. First, south of Nihonbashi, most of Shinagawa post station was damaged, and Minami-Shinagawa was completely washed away, becoming a dead town. The flooding was like a tsunami that swept everything away. About fifty large ships offshore went missing, and the coastal batteries suffered some damage. From there, Shibaura was also mostly damaged like a tsunami, not to mention the Takanawa area, and the Mita and Tamachi areas suffered great damage. A large bronze ship belonging to the Satsuma domain was washed ashore at Shibaura. Around Kanasugi Bridge and Shin-ami-cho along the waterfront, about ten large ships were completely washed ashore. The fire broke out from Katamonzen 1-chome to Shinmei-mae, completely [burning], stopping at one side of Shinmei-cho. Okubo-sama's and Mori-sama's [residences], and Shinseniza suffered mostly damage, and numerous ships large and small [were affected].

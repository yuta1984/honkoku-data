Twenty-ninth day of this month
There was a vendetta carried out by a seventeen-year-old girl in the market area of Fuchū. She was said to be from Echigo Province. The enemy was said to be working as a hairdresser.

Kaneko Bushirō was serving permanent duty in Edo when he went to make New Year's greetings at the place of an artist named Mitsuke, bringing along one apprentice as an attendant. There, an artist named Teisai happened to be present, and they began drinking. While intoxicated, Teisai spoke various abusive words, whereupon Kaneko's disciple killed Teisai and fled. Kaneko was summoned by the authorities and imprisoned.

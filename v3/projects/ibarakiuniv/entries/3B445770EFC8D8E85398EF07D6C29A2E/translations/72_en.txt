Furthermore, I have not separately submitted [this report] to your main store, so I humbly request your kind consideration in all matters.

《6th day, Kōshin》Cloudy from morning, overcast all day. Fine weather from evening, extremely clear during the night.

On the night of August 25th, 3rd year of Ansei, Year of the Dragon, around the hour of Rooster (6 PM), a great southern storm began to blow. Its violence was beyond description - it destroyed houses, blew off roofs, raised waves along the rivers, completely destroyed ships, creating a scene too terrible to behold. At this time thunder rumbled, and there were also earthquakes and fires - extraordinary events whose general outline I record here.

South of Nihonbashi along Tōri-machi street, there was nothing particularly [noteworthy]. Nakabashi and Kyōbashi were the same, with slight damage around Shibaguchi. In the Shiba temple grounds, large trees were uprooted or broken, and the halls also suffered some damage. A fire broke out in front of Shiba Katamon gate and burned about half a chō. Daimon street [suffered] slightly, Shinmei Shrine street, Monzen-machi, Shinmei-machi, all the back streets, Mishima-machi, Ryōgae-machi, one side of Hamamatsu-machi first district, and a little of Udagawa-machi before the fire was contained. Kanasugi and Honshiba waterfront were mostly destroyed, and the daimyo estate along the coast road [was damaged].

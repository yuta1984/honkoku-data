...plotting schemes to create discord between the two lords, falsely accusing those who interfered with treacherous plots and trapping them in charges of treason, conspiring to promote their own faction members to important positions, making various improper false statements, and furthermore under the guise of loyalty secretly spreading information through private channels, alarming other parties and suddenly reversing the national situation, arranging for both lords to reside separately in Komagome or in their domains, and not only that, but also harboring intentions to have the collateral branches intervene in governmental affairs, particularly scheming to cleverly petition for the reinstatement of Torakotobuki and others - these repeated acts of insubordination warrant severe punishment, but through imperial mercy, his domain stipend is confiscated, he is granted a seven-person stipend, and is sentenced to house confinement.

One　　　　　　　　　　Katōgi Saemon
You clearly agreed with Yuki Torakotobuki when he engaged in treacherous and unreasonable conduct years ago and was placed under custody, but at that time through generous imperial benevolence no official judgment was passed. However, you still show no signs of reform and it is heard that you continue to engage in increasingly sinister conduct, which is extremely insubordinate. Though you warrant severe punishment, through imperial mercy your official position and stipend certificate are revoked, you are granted a four-person stipend, and are sentenced to house confinement.

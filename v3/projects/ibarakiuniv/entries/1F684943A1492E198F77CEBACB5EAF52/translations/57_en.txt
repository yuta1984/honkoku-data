The wind was strong, and water overflowed and burst forth from the Kumagaya embankment. Eventually the embankment broke, and the damage extended to the Edo area with flood losses of 120,000-130,000 koku of rice. In the Takasaki area, women and children were seen riding through the town as houses were being swept away. Due to the great flood of the Watarase River in Jōshū, travel around Kiryū was impossible from the 25th until August 4th. In the Koga area, not only the town center but even the lord's residence was flooded over one foot above floor level, requiring complete evacuation. In the Kitsuregawa area, after the floodwaters receded, the town center was so scoured by the rushing water that five to six feet of soil from the roads had been carved away. This was said to be the greatest flood in a hundred years, even greater than the flood of Tenmei 3 (1783).

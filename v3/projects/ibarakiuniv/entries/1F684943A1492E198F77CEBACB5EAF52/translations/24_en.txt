Regarding the townspeople's servants, shop tenants, young men, children, and male and female servants: record their places of birth within the domain territory, names, ages, and family head names in individual documents, write them on official circular paper, and submit them to the Hyōjōsho government office by the coming October.

1. At this time, there have been applications from people coming from other places requesting to rent shops, but we shall not lend to them. However, those who have previously resided within the castle town and are moving are exceptional, so they should inquire at the appropriate time as before.

2. At this time, if relatives or close acquaintances come for business and stay overnight, even for just one night, we must record their place of birth, name, and age for both men and women at that time, and report to the government office. Even if they are people from within the domain, this procedure must be followed. If anyone misunderstands and conceals information without reporting, there will certainly be official punishment. Therefore, this message must be conveyed without fail to everyone from property owners to shop tenants. [End]

It appears there was water damage in various places along the river areas.

Also, regarding the court attendance on Hassaku (August 1st), the outer lords (tozama daimyo) from the provinces all failed to attend due to damage, and the dismounting area looked truly desolate. Additionally, both the Owari and Kii houses, as well as Harima Daigaku and Daini-sama, did not attend court, and it is said that even among the hereditary retainers (fudai), there were those who did not attend. On the 24th, it appears that 630 foreigners landed at Shinagawa.

Foreign Magistrate Mizuno Chikugo-no-kami had previously thrown hot water at foreigners, and it appears he has now committed seppuku. This is truly a matter that calls for sympathy. On the night of the 28th, foreigners were attacked in Yokohama, and there are theories that this was actually the work of Mizuno Chikugo-no-kami's retainers. Recently, when three foreigners went out shopping, about a hundred children aged seven or eight gathered near Shinagawa and threw stones, seriously injuring two foreigners to the point of life and death. The gathering of about a hundred children was surely not by human design but perhaps divine intervention, according to rumors in the city.

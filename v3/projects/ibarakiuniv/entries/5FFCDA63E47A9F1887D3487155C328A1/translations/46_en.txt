　Letter from Edo dated June 28th
　Regarding our situation, conditions are quite favorable with daily sunshine. Regarding quality rice, nearby areas
　are not competitive, and while available rice is scarce, being pressed from above with complete
　indifference, the usual decline in this market exists. In any case, during this great ocean season,
　depending on weather conditions, various changes are difficult to predict. Other miscellaneous grains also decline together.
　Please conduct good speculation. First, this is my inquiry for the hot season.

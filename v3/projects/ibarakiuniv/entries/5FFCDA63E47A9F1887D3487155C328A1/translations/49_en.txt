《Side note: 16th day | 80 degrees》　　Morning haze, hot, strong sunshine from 5th hour and a half

From the evening of the 12th, alarm bells were rung at two locations in the heights of Ōta village, and gradually 700-800 people gathered.

After 8:30, everything was completely withdrawn to somewhere...

The masterless samurai who went to the Tochigi area the other day gathered again at Izuru, where
officials of the Eight Provinces Patrol arrived with firearms and other weapons. They encountered the masterless samurai

scattered and fled. When they interrogated the captured men, they found that they were of unknown origin

men worth taking to Edo, they beheaded all forty-one
men, according to Ogawa Hikojuro's account.

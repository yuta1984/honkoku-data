An interrogation was conducted and she was made to bear stones (torture devices) up to seven of them.
Even so, she maintained her claim of "not knowing," and was subjected to torture so severe that she could not even stand.

As for us, we have been working as subordinates of bad people in our daily lives,
and have been making a living solely by various kinds of intermediary work, which is the retribution for this.
Now that we are old and suffering, we are said to be regretting our past misdeeds.

At this time, the situation in Kyoto is not peaceful, and there are rumors that vagrants are gathering
in the Kozuke Province area. Since it is unpredictable whether they might enter the castle town,
the town patrol officers are making rounds day and night without negligence. Understanding this, moreover,
additional shifts of town officials are being deployed to patrol without any laxity, paying special attention to fire sources and the like.
If anyone who might cause disturbances is spotted, they should be quickly
arrested and reported. Furthermore, when there are unusual incidents, three cannon shots will be fired at the Kodokan Hall according to the official notice. Districts with fire watchtowers should ring the alarm bell quickly, and others should strike the wooden clappers at their district offices. At such times, everyone should bring their firearms to the town meeting place, await our instructions, and act accordingly. This must be communicated without fail to all subordinates.

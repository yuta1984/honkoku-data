He then returned to the lodging and told his adoptive mother: "Father is now somewhere with
a serious illness, and I cannot bring him back alone, so please come with me immediately."
So the adoptive mother also went, whereupon he led her into the mountains and,
explaining why he had killed the father, grabbed the mother by the hair and knocked her down,
ground her face against stones, and also struck her head with large stones,
crushing her to death. He then returned to the lodging as if nothing had happened and pretended ignorance until the next day.
When his wife found that both parents had not gotten up,
she went to look but they were not there, so she asked
where they had gone, but no one knew and there was a commotion. The husband said, "Where could they have
gone? Let me go and divine their whereabouts." After a while
he returned and told his wife: "I divined and found that father is dead somewhere
and mother is dead in a certain direction." Suddenly neighbors
came, and they found the bodies dead exactly where the son-in-law had indicated. This being extremely
suspicious, the villagers questioned the man, but though he
concealed the truth at first, perhaps thinking he could no longer hide it, he tried to
escape. A large group pursued and captured him, whereupon he confessed the entire
sequence of events. His wife, shocked, attacked her husband with a small sword she had at hand,
inflicting wounds in two or three places, but the crowd
restrained her, and he was imprisoned. Having heard this, I am speechless at such great
evil and inhumanity, and I wonder what must be in that woman's heart.

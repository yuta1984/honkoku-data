...setting fires, and those who resisted were killed. Edo has become engulfed in tremendous flames. Everyone was in great uproar all day, but when night fell on the 17th, it turned out to be completely unfounded. However, on the 13th, foot soldiers caused disturbances in Yoshiwara, so Lord Sakai's forces cut down sixteen or seventeen of them. When about three hundred foot soldiers then pressed toward Yoshiwara, mediators intervened and they withdrew peacefully. This report may have been confused with the urgent messenger that arrived.

18th day (26 degrees) Heavy frost, cold, clear

Yesterday's urgent dispatch reported that the disturbance in Mito domain occurred because the third son of Lord Shō Shōzaemon of the Koishikawa residence, who was on duty at the palace on the 16th, suddenly went mad. Urgent palanquins were dispatched from various places directly to the home domain, arriving around the eighth hour of the night on the 16th. A great incident occurred in Edo, with groups of thirty to fifty men of unknown affiliation scattered in various locations, setting fires from the Shiba area to Shinagawa, and also around Senju and other places. The Shiba area appeared to be in great conflagration. Particularly along the main road in the Senju area, there were reportedly fourteen or fifteen dead bodies. As the situation appeared increasingly serious, two other men were sent as urgent messengers to the home domain, but since they have not yet arrived, it appears they were likely killed en route.

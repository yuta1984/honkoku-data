Your son Keisaburō has consistently shown poor conduct, not only forming a faction with Yūki Toratoshi and engaging in improper behavior, but also harboring the villain Tomogoro from Jōshū, who claimed to be a retainer of Yatabe Tōshichirō and had previously entered into a master-disciple contract in swordsmanship. Therefore, when arrest officers were dispatched on the 10th day of the 7th month of the Year of the Tiger, he joined with Tōshichirō to obstruct the arrest officers, coordinated with Tomogoro to provide him with both swords and travel expenses, and helped him escape in broad daylight through the back entrance across the boundaries of townhouses. At that time, he conspired with Tōshichirō to stubbornly maintain false claims and cover up the matter, but when subjected to official investigation, he claimed to be remorseful. However, his conduct of assisting wicked individuals and showing contempt for authority is utterly inexcusable. Therefore, although punishment should be imposed, through mercy your official position and stipend allowance are revoked and you are entrusted with custody. Ultimately, this matter stems from inadequate instruction and represents extreme negligence, so your official position is terminated and you are assigned to the civil engineering corps. You must therefore be extremely careful and maintain proper restraint.

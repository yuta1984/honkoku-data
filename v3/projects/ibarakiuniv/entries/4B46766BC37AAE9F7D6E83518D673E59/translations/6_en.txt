From last winter, in a place called Oyamada Kamigo, in the mountains among valleys with oak trees, where there are cedar groves on both sides, small birds called Atori have gathered in great numbers. They have divided into two groups in these cedar groves, and from seven o'clock in the evening (4 PM) they fight each other like a battle. Every day, dead birds amount to about two straw bales. The battles continue daily even now. At this time, crowds of spectators gather, and various merchants come out as well. It is said that this matter has been reported to the district office.

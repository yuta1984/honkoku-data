Therefore, we respectfully wish to conduct tomorrow's Hassaku ceremony without incident. The above.
　Regarding the American officials stationed in Shimoda, Izu Province: they have brought correspondence from their president's country and have been ordered by the president's country to proceed to Edo and present it. Accordingly, they have insisted on coming to Edo, and when the Shimoda magistrate gradually responded to them, they explained that in countries with friendly relations, when bringing correspondence from their sovereign, it is customary worldwide to proceed to the capital and have an audience with the emperor to present it. As the global situation is gradually changing, our country too must reform the foreign relations system that has been in place since the Kan'ei era. Since America has concluded a treaty and become a friendly nation, permission has been granted for these officials to come to Edo at this time, and His Majesty intends to allow them to have an audience at the castle. This matter is to be communicated as a preliminary confidential notification.
　The above was sent from Edo on the second day of the eighth month.
In His Majesty's own hand.
　Similarly, among the retainers, senior councilors and captains serve as examples for others due to their position, so they must naturally be prudent in their conduct and should also cultivate both literary and military arts.

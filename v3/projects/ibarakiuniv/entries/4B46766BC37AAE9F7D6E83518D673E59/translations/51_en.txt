bales, with no sellers available. However, it seems each [merchant] possesses goods.
Even at this time, if it's 14.5 bales,
some say it would be fine to sell around 800-900 bales.
At these prices, locally it has risen about 5 to 2-3 sho,
so they say.
Last day [of month] Morning cloudy and muggy. Clear from half past the 4th hour.
《Marginal note: 74 degrees｜9 o'clock 76 degrees》 All day southerly weather pattern with some lingering summer heat.
　From the 24th of this month, shipwrecked herring roe came for sale. Initially
　trading at about 100 mon per sho, then gradually many sellers came,
　becoming about 32 mon, 28 mon per sho. Each household bought
　because of the low price and ate it, but as soon as they ate it, they immediately got sick,
　suffering greatly with vomiting and diarrhea. In the upper and lower town districts, those who
　didn't fall ill were truly rare. Among them, one person died in Yoshinuma,
　one in Daimachi, one in Aoyagi, one around Nemoto area.
　From what I gradually heard, [the roe] went to Fuchu area, Tsuchiura, Kasama and various other places, and everywhere people got sick.
　Everyone suffered for about 4-5 days each, so one should be careful.
　Herring roe is not good before or after childbirth either. Women should
　especially take note.

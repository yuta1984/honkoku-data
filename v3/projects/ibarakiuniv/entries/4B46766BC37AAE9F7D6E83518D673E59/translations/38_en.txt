[The Americans] came saying they had been ordered to come to Hakodate, Japan, to rent land and reside there. We told them that such a matter could not be agreed to, but they would not accept this. There was another meeting on the 7th as well. However, since this matter had to be referred to Edo, we did not inform them and it was decided that we must report urgently. From the 8th day, they came ashore and remained there. From the 8th, the Americans established a market at their place of residence. While I believe this should be discussed among the officials, in my humble opinion, I wonder how this should be handled. In any case, when Russians or British also come aboard and appear, since the Americans have already come first and established their home country's market in Japan, we should also understand the direction in which we should make requests from our side.

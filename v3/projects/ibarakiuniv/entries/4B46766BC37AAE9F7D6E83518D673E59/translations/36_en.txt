Regarding the construction of batteries at both river mouths in that location, if relying only on the immediate vicinity, it would be difficult to procure sufficient earth and sand. Therefore, following the precedent of the Tempo era, a special large-scale river dredging shall be ordered. The plan is to use this dredged earth and sand for battery construction, as previously communicated. However, considering the local circumstances, even if relief dredging is ordered, much of the work will likely need to be carried out with local resources as before.

In these recent times of numerous affairs, with natural disasters striking various provinces consecutively, enormous expenses have accumulated, making this a considerable financial burden. However, matters of coastal defense cannot be postponed. Therefore, this time, using government funds, the battery construction and warship preparations shall proceed as detailed in the separate document. Please take note of this matter.

Although there has been continuous dredging of the local rivers, due to years of silting and excavation, the water flow at both river mouths has recently deteriorated, with the dredged channels becoming shallow, making transportation inconvenient. This naturally affects commodity prices and appears to be contributing to the general decline of urban commerce. In any case, special large-scale dredging must be implemented.

Regarding the new battery construction, when river relief dredging is subsequently ordered, care shall be taken to ensure it does not obstruct water traffic. The batteries shall be constructed with actual defense as the primary consideration. It is believed that instructions to this effect should also be given to the town magistrate's office.

The above.

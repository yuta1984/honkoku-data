1. Document handed to Lord Hotta Bitchu-no-kami
　　Council of State assembly appointment, in charge of Nagasaki Magistrate
　　and Hakodate Magistrate

Regarding the matter that American officials staying in Shimoda submitted through a written request for an audience with the Senior Councilors: initially, we instructed that the Shimoda Magistrate should accept and handle this matter, and sent a reply accordingly. However, depending on the nature of further requests, if they were to be summoned to this location, it might not be appropriate. Therefore, it would be proper to roughly determine the procedures for such cases. As the officials appear to be persons of good standing, the handling of such matters cannot follow the same arrangements as with Dutch captains. All aspects of protocol must be thoroughly investigated and quickly understood, ensuring no oversight in ceremonial etiquette, treatment methods, lodging arrangements, receptions, and all other matters.

Reply to American Officials

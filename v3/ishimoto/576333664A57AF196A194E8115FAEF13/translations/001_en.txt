"The Earthquake Monster Catfish from Kamigata - Also Called the Disaster Beast"
Evening performance on October 2nd, Ansei 2nd year

A great catfish lives at the bottom of Mount Sumeru and transforms into a four-legged creature with a complete body. This is called the "disaster beast." When it moves its head and tail once, it uproots Mount Tai, dries up the blue sea, destroys palaces, towers, halls, temples, great houses, and storehouses, and emits flames from its body most violently. Its groaning voice makes even a hundred thousand thunders seem like nothing, and it seems as if it might overturn the southern continent. The people of the world have their dwellings destroyed and lose their treasures because of this, and their fear while chanting "banzairaku" exceeds that of Thunder God.

The overall appearance: Its "face" is like a catfish, breathing flames from its mouth and emitting fire from thirty-seven places on its body. Its "head" resembles the roof of a storehouse. Its "back" is like arranged roof tiles, and some parts are like roof boards. When it shakes its body, the tiles on its back scatter in all directions like powder. The areas with cedar bark roofing vary. In its "belly" there is a disease called cowardice, and when it's in its own dwelling, its body stiffens and it cannot move freely. Therefore, when it sleeps in the evening, it camps out on the highways. Its "legs" are like four pillars, swaying uselessly. It constantly uses round logs like walking sticks, named "karabari," and stands unsteadily. Its "tail" is like approaching great waves, and those who touch this tail are swept up together and move their business to hell, changing their name to "Dozaemon." This tail is called tsunami - a fearsome disaster beast.

Originally, this beast coiled around Toyoakitsushima in the age of gods and occasionally emerged to torment the people. The Imperial Great Deity who rules the land received a divine oracle through the Kashima deity to press down its head with a stone seat (commonly called the keystone) and prevent it from moving. Therefore, without trouble from this disaster beast, the reign prospered unshakably, and all people chanted banzairaku.

However, when the various gods are absent, it moves its body slightly, but when people call out banzairaku, they escape the disaster. But this shape-shifter found its opportunity this year in October, when the eight million deities went to Izumo. It watched for this opening, stirred underground, and damaged houses and storehouses in 3,600 neighborhoods tremendously. It frequently seemed as if it might overturn the world. Ebisu-no-mikoto (the Ebisu deity), who was house-sitting, sent an urgent message to Izumo Province, and by command of the Imperial Great Deity, the Kashima deity and Jirobo of Mount Atago returned immediately and subdued this disaster beast with the essential cornerstone, making the world solid as a rock.

Amaterasu's apology
"Not getting better at all, even the demons. These fellows of ours have been here a month, absent or present - lazy ones have been rampaging. It would be good to send Kashima back first."
♪Even when the bird longing for its mate is away, skillfully, earthquakes and fires are of the same kind, so staying calm would have brought help, ah, banzairaku

"Come now, shake and see. In disturbances it's truly pitiful, in great fires it's disinheritance. The shaking shops are amateurs, completely ruined. In this locality during the Genroku period, we encountered the disaster of this catfish monster, a beast called natural disaster. Without anger, just a little. Witnessing hardships, near the storehouses, mutual collapse, oh what a disaster."

"Chilling Out the Catfish in the Peaceful Reign"

A giant catfish sneaks around and peeks through the lattice
to observe the prosperity of a thriving house
in bustling Hanakawado, Edo.
When a young apprentice spots it and whispers,
a courtesan flies out and tries
to catch it by force, but the catfish slips away,
wriggling through and escaping capture.
"Hey, quickly bring
a gourd!" she says.
A quick-witted young man declares "This will
hold it down securely!" and brings a sake bottle.
With this, they easily restrain it, so
wondering "This is strange," they look closely and see it's a
Kashima sake bottle.

Courtesan: "Hey, you really
made too much of a commotion! You suddenly
caused a disturbance in this neighborhood
and made a great fuss.
The shop
and second floor
all at once—
when everything gets twisted around,
it makes one dizzy!
How embarrassing!"

Customer: "Let go of
those whiskers,
won't you? If you pull
them out, your
spirit would be
quite as
hard as those whiskers."

The Matter of the Catfish Gourd Person's Floating Document

First, regarding this person called Shin Kurō, his birthplace is Jimoguri Village in Kanameishi District, Hitachi Province, and being a reliable active person, he stands as a fire victim even in blazing fires and such, causing great disturbance by shaking up dangerous situations, which is quite troublesome. The difficult matter is that from the evening sleepy time of the 2nd day of the 10th month of this year of the Rabbit until the crawling of the four o'clock of the following 3rd day, it was determined that the monetary losses - damaged ryō, damaged bu, damaged shu - were regrettably burned away. Regarding the ceremonial clothing, in summer one piece of thunder, lightning, white rain, and shining objects (rumbling thunder evening shower finale light objects), in winter one padded cloth garment with scattered flame powder shall be bestowed.

First, needless to say regarding His Lordship of Kantō's eight provinces, for the sake of uniform stability throughout all provinces, we must not cause disturbance. Should this person go to an inappropriate kitchen area or to the "Osanton" quarters, brandishing a large pestle and breaking mortars, and after much crawling about, cause private earthquakes, or should he flee with shaking and cause wall collapses, we shall immediately provide skilled carpenters and plasterers with crossbeams for repairs and quickly resolve the matter.

First, regarding troublesome matters, due to the difficult bell sect, temples have small shakings, rivers, scattered bridges, jangwara temples, and houses collapsed in an instant. The eight directions are not of the shaking Christian burning sect. Should there be no rattling and shaking sounds from daily activities regarding this matter, if there should be return shaking, tsunamis, etc., we solid people as witnesses to the keystone shall quickly emerge for the earthquake, press down firmly, and shall not trouble you with makeshift sleeping in the fields or temporary shelter construction. After earthquakes, lumber prices become high when purchased.

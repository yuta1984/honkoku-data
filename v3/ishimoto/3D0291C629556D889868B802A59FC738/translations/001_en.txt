The Great Catfish Captured Three Times During the Great Earthquakes

Carpenter:
"Well, sir, we have thoroughly explained the wrongdoing of this 'gun' (causing earthquakes), so we will apologize in any case. Please entrust this matter to us. In truth, since this is our first time, taking one bu per day and drinking our fill of sake is all thanks to this fellow (the catfish). We must make this apology even at the cost of our lives."

Fireman:
"Yes, yes, just as you say. Without such events, we wouldn't even have the chance to show our faces here. From here on, let us be the first to stand up for you."

Plasterer:
"As that gentleman says, it's not that we rejoice in people's suffering, but without such events, we'd be left high and dry. Roofer, isn't it the same for you?"

Roofer:
"Indeed it is. On days when I do repair work, I can't even drink my favorite rice wine (sake). For us, this is like a life-giving parent. Please, have mercy on him."

Doctor:
"Yes, yes, even someone like me can earn five or six fees in a single morning thanks to the earthquake deity. I've paid off both my debts to the rice dealer from before the earthquake and five months' worth of accumulated shop rent. Considering all this, please overlook this matter. If possible, please employ this reformed version of myself. I can make money again."

As they selfishly made these arguments and created a commotion with their apologies, the Kashima deity inwardly found it amusing and smiled, but deliberately raised his voice harshly:

"No, this cannot be permitted. If we forgive such a sinful creature, the catfish throughout Japan's sixty-odd provinces will think it acceptable and cause such suffering to the people again, bringing great destruction to the cities. As a warning for the future, he shall be subjected to the punishment of being grilled in a pot."

Since he would not listen to their pleas at all, they had no choice but to sigh and say, "Please have mercy on us. What shall we do?"

Earthquake and Fire Disaster Purification

Oh, what a terrible time! Let us purify tonight's natural disaster with divine power. From October 2nd for three days, looking at the townscape and gates, in just one night, storehouses and walls collapsed into mountains of rubble.

Having suffered such hardship, we carried out round logs like the Aioi pines (symbol of marital harmony) and cedar logs, along with beautifully decorated household goods, to outside our gardens, and the suffering of sleeping outdoors is like an illness. Tiles and stones falling like rain sting our eyes, and we spend day and night in the burned wasteland wet with tears, serving as neighborhood watch groups, being careful of fire and personal safety.

Though it's not spring, everyone begins singing celebration songs, and countless pillars have broken, creating crowds of people calling it auspicious - this too is world renewal. The gods who returned from Izumo have trampled firm this reed plain of our imperial land, and like a mother, we cherish this unchanging reign that will become a cornerstone rock for a thousand years, eight thousand years, until moss grows upon it.

And if those slippery catfish that crawl about seeking opportunities move their tails back and forth again, as representatives of the Kashima deity, we shall spread word of this matter and suppress them, crossing over the High Heavenly Plain and washing them away smoothly into the Mimosuso River.

For Fūzoku Gahō (Customs Illustrated) Issue No. 35 only, we will publish a special edition on the 30th of this month, compiling an entire issue dedicated solely to earthquake-related articles. The editorial format will focus on this recent earthquake, comprehensively covering all aspects of the disaster's tragic conditions through observations and investigations, including scholars' theories and practitioners' testimonies, as well as matters that should serve as references for architecture and civil engineering, no matter how large or small. We will add elaborate lithographic illustrations to make it seem as if one is seeing the truth itself. Additionally, we will reference and compare major earthquakes from ancient Japan to modern times, particularly the Ansei disasters, thoroughly searching for and obtaining the most rare items such as contemporary maps and printed materials, which we will reprint and insert to compile an accurate earthquake history. We humbly ask readers to favor us with their readership.

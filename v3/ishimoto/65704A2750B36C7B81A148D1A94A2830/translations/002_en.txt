True View and Directional Illustrated Map of Mount Nokogiri Nihon Zen Temple in Awa Province

【Upper Left】
This mountain was founded by Gyoki in the first year of Jinki era, located at the border between the two provinces of Boso. The rocks naturally form the shapes of Buddhist statues and birds and beasts, and the peaks resemble the teeth of a saw, hence it is called Mount Nokogiri (Saw Mountain), being a historic site of about one thousand years. During the An'ei period, in addition to these natural formations, 1,200 stone Rakan statues and Kannon statues from the Saigoku, Chichibu, Bando, and Sagami pilgrimage circuits were enshrined.

Mount Nokogiri - Long Poem and Reply Poem by Suginomoto Shido

In the eastern land where birds sing toward the sun
Though the sea is wide and mountains fill the land
The peak of Nokogiri in Awa, land of water birds, rises high
In the winding corners of the mugwort caves, fifteen hundred Buddhas
Beautiful as the morning sun, beautiful as the evening sun
In spring with flowers, in autumn with maple leaves as ornaments
Looking up with reverence, the twin peaks of
Mount Tsukuba appear like eyebrows blending with the clouds
Mount Fuji's high peak in Suruga is pure white
With snow that has fallen, that snow never ceasing
For a thousand generations, like boats crossing distant Omi
Their landing places unknown, to unknown lands beyond the horizon
The name is heard and praised, truly Japan's temple

Reply Poem:
Even the Buddha must have descended to this mountain
It feels like a place outside the floating world

"Teasing Catfish in a Peaceful Reign"

In the bustling Hanakawado district of Edo, a large catfish
stealthily peeks through the lattice windows to observe
the prosperity of a thriving pleasure quarter.
When a kamuro (young attendant) spots it and whispers,
an oiran (courtesan) rushes out and tries to
capture it by force, but the catfish slips away,
wriggling through and escaping capture.
So she says, "Hey, quickly bring
a gourd!"
A quick-witted young man says, "This will
definitely hold it down" and brings a sake bottle.
With no trouble at all, they manage to restrain it.
"How strange!" they say, and looking closely, they see it's
a Kashima sake bottle.

[Middle section - dialogue inside the lattice]
Prostitute: "Hey, you are really too
terrible! Just the other day you suddenly
went wild and caused a big commotion.
The shop and
the second floor -
all at once
you twisted and destroyed everything.
It makes my head spin!
How inconsiderate of you."

[Lower section]
Customer: "Let go of
those whiskers!
If you pull them out,
your spirit
will probably become
much stronger."

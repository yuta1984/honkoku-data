○Ajigawa Bridge ○Kamei Bridge ○Tamatsu Bridge - a total of eleven bridges
○The tsunami surged up at Tempozan, and since both the fishermen and private houses in this area were flooded, everyone fled up to Tempozan. The private houses suffered great damage, and small houses collapsed and were washed away. All the reclaimed rice fields (shinden) in this area were flooded, so the farmers each fled up to the embankments. Afterward, everyone built temporary huts on top of the embankments and lived there.

Now, what we call earthquakes do not have their actual form specially located in the earth's depths. Yang energy lies hidden beneath yin and is pressed down by yin energy, unable to rise. As yang energy stagnates and years and months pass, the earth splits and yang energy attempts to release toward heaven, causing vibrations.

Also, what we call tsunamis do not specifically mean the emission of water from underground. The movement and emission between heaven and earth, enveloped by yang and yin, is generally the same as earthquakes. Therefore, they occur due to earthquakes, or sometimes occur due to great windstorms and rain. This can be understood from the fact that the places where they occur are not fixed.

Brief Record of Futarasan Hot Springs

Tsuru-no-yu (Crane Hot Spring)　　　Kawara-yu (Riverbank Hot Spring)
Donsu-yu (Satin Hot Spring)　　　　Naka-yu (Middle Hot Spring)
Taki-yu (Waterfall Hot Spring)　　　Uba-yu (Old Woman Hot Spring)
Gosho-yu (Palace Hot Spring)　　　　Sasa-yu (Bamboo Grass Hot Spring)
Jizai-yu (At-will Hot Spring)　　　Ara-yu (Wild Hot Spring)

These hot springs were originally bestowed by Ōnamuchi-no-kami, the great ancestor of medical arts in our country, for the relief and protection of the people. Each spring demonstrates different types of remarkable therapeutic effects. Accordingly, their temperatures also vary, and the fact that there exists a hot spring suitable for each ailment makes this truly a sacred place bestowed by heaven, particularly an excellent location that combines both summer retreat and healing benefits. Moreover, the absolute beauty of the scenery lives up to the proverb that says "Do not speak of magnificence without having seen Nikkō."

The temperatures and therapeutic properties of these ten springs mentioned above are detailed in the hot spring record, which should be consulted.

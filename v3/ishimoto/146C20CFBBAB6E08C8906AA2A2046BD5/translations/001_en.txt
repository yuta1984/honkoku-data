"Earthquake Wonder Medicine" Getokusan (Lower Virtue Participation) "One Collapse, Eight Hundred and Eight Districts"

1. The meaning of this collapse is a divine revelation from the Great God of Kashima. When fire breaks out once, thirty-six places will turn to ash, and the tremors will destroy houses and storehouses within a four-ri radius, forcing people to sleep outdoors. However, afterward, business will flourish, daily wages will circulate, courtesans will prosper living in temporary housing, gold and silver will be extracted from the wealthy to provide relief to the lower classes, and no matter how destitute, rescue shelters will be built in five locations to care for people. Governing the world is like an earthquake.

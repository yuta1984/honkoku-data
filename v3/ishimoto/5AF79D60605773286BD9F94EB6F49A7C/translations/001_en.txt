【Description of Kashima-ura】
Standing on the rocky shore of Kashima-ura and looking due west toward the eastern ocean, even when there is no wind, you can see in the northeast direction what appears like saw teeth pointing toward the sky - this is Mount Kinkazan in Ōshū, visible at a distance of fourteen to fifteen ri. It is fifty ri from the mouth of the Chōshi River. The beautiful scenery there is most wonderful.

【Description of the River at Yuimatsu】
This river initially seeps out from sandy ground, becomes a waterfall in the middle section flowing with loud sounds, then seeps back into the sand, and at its end becomes like an ordinary road. For this reason, it is called "Suenashi-gawa" (the Endless River).

【Description of Tokushima】
The ancient name of this area was called Minohata-e.

The shores of these islands are enclosed with barriers made of iris and wild rice plants. The circumference of the island is more than nine ri.

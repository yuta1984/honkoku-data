Generally speaking, heaven and earth have unexpected calamities - first thunder, great winds, heavy rains, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, and various other natural disasters. As for fires, they arise from one's own carelessness, negligence, and lack of vigilance, so they are not matters of divine fate. However, an event like the recent one was an unprecedented phenomenon. During the great earthquake, fires broke out in all four directions within Edo Castle, and the momentary chaos was indescribable. At such times, even the greatest heroes and wise men can hardly claim to be without some momentary lapses of attention, much less ordinary people. This is all because people lack proper mental preparation in normal times, and when mistakes occur, later regrets cannot undo them. This book is for people of good intention to read and teach to their wives, children, servants, and others as preparation, so that if future upheavals occur, they will not panic or cause commotion, and will avoid injuries. I have recorded the essentials for this purpose. What has been omitted will appear in a later volume.

Precautions During Earthquakes
▲Now, on October 2nd of the 2nd year of Ansei, around 4 o'clock at night, there was a great earthquake in Edo, during which fires broke out and blazed up from about thirty-odd locations, with countless neighborhoods suffering from spreading fires. Even storehouses that normally withstand fires had all their walls shaken off, exposing their framework, so fire spread most rapidly. By the hour of the Rat (midnight), fires raged in all directions, reflecting in the sky like broad daylight. Moreover, there were people trapped under collapsed houses and storehouses who could not escape on their own. Though we wanted to rescue them, we were so shocked by the initial earthquake and thoroughly frightened, and overwhelmed by the fires everywhere, that we completely lost our presence of mind. Without distinguishing between elderly, wives, and children, we could not even think of rescue, barely escaping with our own bodies alone. Due to such limitless chaos, deaths, injuries, and damage to houses and storehouses are incalculable.

Such calamities have been unprecedented since the Kamakura period, so people of this generation have no knowledge of them because they have spent years in complete peace without thinking of disorder. Setting aside the distant past, there was the great Kyoto earthquake on July 2nd of Bunsei 12, which continued shaking for over seventy days afterward, the Shinshū earthquake in March of Kōka 4, and those in Sagami Odawara and Izu Shimoda in Kaei 8, among others. Since these upheavals come without warning, one should always be prepared. Even when there is a great earthquake, it does not shake for half an hour - it is only the time of one or two puffs of tobacco. This is where earth energy erupts and then subsides.

▲When an earthquake suddenly occurs, it is natural for everyone to be startled, panic, and make noise. Therefore, humans must settle their resolve when facing events. One cannot manage throughout life without this mindset. Whether at home or elsewhere, the primary consideration should be direction, geographical advantages, and the condition of the land.

▲Making a commotion during an earthquake is extremely bad, though it depends on the condition of the house. For board-roofed, single-story houses, it is increasingly bad to run outside. One should sit in a place where things will not fall. Even if the house collapses, it is only a matter of pushing aside a futon, so one must not panic.

▲There is deep wisdom in fleeing. Because things happen rapidly, people panic and stumble, twist their feet, fall, have tiles fall on them causing serious injuries, or have beams fall creating life-threatening situations - this happened frequently in various places recently, as should be understood. Therefore, running out requires careful consideration. During the Shinshū earthquake, those who remained calm in temple halls or inns were safe. Those who panicked and ran out fell into cracks in the earth, or were caught when storehouses or mansion buildings collapsed all at once, so it is better to take shelter in light upper areas. One should also judge the circumstances of the moment.

▲When evacuating, one should temporarily reside in open areas safely away from tall buildings on all sides. Do not go near seas or rivers. For elderly people, women, and children, the first priority is avoiding dampness and protecting against cold. Surround on all sides, cover above, and lay tatami mats thick in both directions below. Even if the earth cracks, one will not fall in and will not receive earth energy from below. Even if one catches cold or suffers from chronic illness and experiences pain during this time, medicines are difficult to obtain as desired, and even if doctors are summoned, they cannot arrive quickly enough, as should be understood. Since everyone is frightened by the earthquake, they lack energy, and their usual strength cannot be relied upon. There is nothing to do but be cautious and make vigilance the first priority.

▲After evacuating, the security of one's house is compromised, and there will naturally be lost items. Also, thinking of fire prevention and other matters, even with servants present, the master should make rounds from time to time. Moreover, one should carefully observe the surroundings of the residence. If dangerous or suspicious things are noticed nearby, one should be prepared. During times of chaos, one must not be careless about anything.

▲People on the second floor during an earthquake should not come down hastily. Most of those who escaped in Yoshiwara this time were on the second floor. Even if crushed by shaking, the load is light, removal is quick, and rescue is easy. Though the earth may crack, one should carefully consider things falling from above.

▲Generally, great earthquakes do not cease their aftershocks quickly. Kyoto's earthquake lasted over seventy days, Shinshū's over thirty days, and Sagami's about half a month with small tremors. Therefore, even this time, from October 2nd extending to the 10th day, the energy has not dissipated, with shaking occurring two or three times daily. Since the initial great shock drained people's energy, afterward there have been no strong shakes. This situation should be thoroughly explained to women, children, and servants. When even slight shaking begins, people cry "There!" and make a commotion, so weak people, children, and women develop illnesses that are difficult to treat. The hardship is indescribable. This is all the work of those without understanding, so unless they are firmly warned, great disasters will follow.

▲Fish live in water without knowing water exists; people dwell in air without knowing that air. There is evidence right before our eyes. When birds perched on things experience earthquakes, they wobble unsteadily just like humans. Though it would be good if they could fly up into the air at such times, there is proof this cannot be accomplished - birds flying in the air have their wingbeats disrupted and immediately fall downward. Between heaven and earth, yin-yang energy fills all space, nourishing people, animals, and plants. When hot and cold energies are in harmony, the realm is peaceful; when disharmonious, underground energy also becomes disharmonious, and countries where this energy concentrates shake greatly. When the earth cracks and earth energy disperses, earthquakes stop. However, in lands with many mountains like Shinshū, cracking and breaking occur slowly, so shaking continues until breaking occurs, making the duration longer. Edo's land has no mountains, shallow forests and groves, well-formed seas and rivers, and waterways running vertically and horizontally, so earth energy normally circulates without concentrating enough to congeal, making great earthquakes extremely rare.

Upheavals like the recent one are probably not solely due to severely unseasonable weather. These theories and evidence will be presented in a later volume. As mentioned, since this is a country with thin earth veins, there should be no great or prolonged shaking. Edo natives should remain calm and not panic.

Precautions for Fires
▲Samurai families and great houses have emergency equipment, so their prevention and extinguishing methods should be swift. However, medium-sized and smaller establishments lack firefighting tools and manpower, making it difficult to manage water supplies, ultimately leading to great fires with much spreading fire damage, often causing trouble for other houses. For small fires, old clothes and bedding should be soaked in water and used to beat out flames. If consideration for neighboring and other houses allows one's own family to extinguish the fire, that is good. If this proves insufficient, one should raise one's voice and call nearby people. This understanding is primary. With many people, water supplies work better, and arrangements for various directions are well-managed, naturally making extinguishing easier. Simply maintaining constant fire vigilance is all there is.

▲During nearby fires, observing wind direction and fire intensity should be the first priority. Those with servants should give appropriate instructions for gathering and storing belongings and focus primarily on measures to escape spreading fires. Small households should have elderly, young, and women carry appropriate items and flee ahead. When fire becomes truly urgent, there should be no attachment to possessions or greed. There is the saying "like a summer moth flying into flame." Making mistakes due to attachment to trivial things when facing danger is commonly spoken of. The many injured people of this type recently should make this clear. However, when it involves one's master, teacher, or parents, it cannot be treated lightly. One should judge the circumstances.

▲When surrounded by fire with no escape, one should thoroughly soak one's clothing in water, cover oneself from head down with only eyes showing, and run through the area with the least fire. Perhaps realizing this, at Yoshiwara there was someone who escaped this way and rescued three courtesans in the same manner. At such times, one only panics without good judgment emerging. Know that obtaining life in a situation of near-certain death depends on one's resolve.

Precautions for Tsunamis and Floods
▲There are two types of tsunamis. Earthquakes shake even the ocean floor, making seawater rage and surge up into nearby villages all at once, making this sudden change extremely dangerous. This should already be understood from the Shimoda disaster. Even at such times, one should observe terrain and directions. Those ignorant of these matters find escape difficult. When seeing such calamities, one should abandon greed, take along family members high and low, select high, safe ground, and evacuate. At that time, ensure household members do not scatter. Even one person missing makes security difficult. This should be thoroughly explained regularly.

▲The area around Ukita and Funabori before the Shimōsa Province Nakagawa checkpoint experiences floods during heavy rains, and when storm winds are strong, seawater and river water are blown up onto the floors of private houses, washing away various goods and causing hardship repeatedly. At such times, local people select convenient, safe ground to escape these disasters. Going upstairs, climbing onto roofs, or up trees may occur, but how can this be reassuring? In cases like Shimoda, both houses and storehouses are knocked down and pulled into the sea, so they cannot be relied upon at all. Therefore, swift observation according to circumstances should be the primary concern.

▲Not only for earthquakes, great thunder, fires, and floods, but when any calamity occurs, one should refrain from drinking alcohol. When intoxicated, everything becomes careless, and even people with servants find it difficult for instructions to reach properly, and many who made mistakes were seen recently. Especially since there is physical fatigue during upheavals, one should drink after things have settled down. Simply preparing food so as not to become hungry and maintaining preparedness so as not to be troubled by any calamity is most important. What has been omitted from this will appear in the later volume, so please read it.

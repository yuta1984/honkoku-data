【The text is composed of three sections】

【First Section】
When the earthquake caused the wealthy man's storehouse to collapse greatly, the wealthy man was extremely distressed and worried about what to do, when the fortune gods came and admonished him.

Daikoku: "Now, now, even though this is the gold that you and your ancestors have accumulated for generations, it won't do to merely guard your money. The treasure of the world requires circulation as its essence, and it must not just be hoarded away. Look, even though your storehouse has aged and your house has collapsed, there is no need to lose heart. If you give away half of your money to many people, through such virtuous deeds your person will become even more peaceful, and houses, storehouses, and estates can be built again as many times as needed."

【Second Section】
"Such things can be done. First, let good words lead the way."

【Third Section】
Mochimaru: "I understand. However, shall we keep this money stored as it is, take out a small amount, buy those catfish that can be seen at eel shops and such, and release them into the great river?"

Daikoku: "That's also good, but why can't you spend money?"

Ebisu: "That's right."

Mochimaru: "Yes, it would be more difficult than releasing catfish. Please consider ways to help people."

Ebisu: "Exactly, exactly, just as Lord Daikoku says, at this time there are many who give charity to the poor. Even if these people feel dissatisfied, they put their own prosperity second, and until they believe in their hearts to avoid injury and mistakes, there's no need to worry. If one practices virtue appropriately, it's natural that the gods will protect them. Won't you have the spirit to give charity?"

Mochimaru: "Yes, yes, regardless of anything else, I will follow your guidance."

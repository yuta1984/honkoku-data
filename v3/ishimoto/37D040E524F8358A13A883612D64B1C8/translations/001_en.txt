【Main Text】
Hearing that a great earthquake struck Edo, how much must parents, siblings, and relatives throughout the country be grieving and lamenting! To reassure them as quickly as possible, I record this in detail: On the night of October 2nd, Ansei 2nd year, starting from the fourth hour of night (around 10 PM), the earth began to shake. Houses and storehouses collapsed, with numerous deaths and injuries. Moreover, fires broke out in twelve or thirteen locations simultaneously, creating a great conflagration.

First, the pleasure houses in Shin-Yoshiwara's five districts burned, with an enormous number of deaths and injuries. The entire Tamachi area, Umamichi, Yama-no-yado, and Hanakawado burned fiercely and extensively. Fortunately, Kannon-sama's main hall, Nio-mon gate, and Kaminari-mon gate suffered no damage at all, though only roof tiles remained at Yadaijin-mon gate, while all temple buildings collapsed.

Komagata Suhara-cho and Kurofune-cho burned, with the fire stopping at Hachiman-cho corner. At another fire source, one side of Shibai-cho and Yakusha Shindo remained. At yet another source, fires were extinguished at Sakai Utanokami-sama's residence inside Kanda-bashi and Endo Tajima-no-kami-sama's residence on Morikawa Daimyo Koji. The northeastern mansion of Inshu-sama burned, but the area from the main gate to the palace buildings remained. Ogasawara-sama burned slightly, while Nagai Hida-no-kami-sama and Honda Nakatsukasa Taiyu-sama burned. Doi-sama was half-burned, and Matsudaira Ukyo-no-suke-sama burned slightly. Inside Wadakura-gomon, Aizu-sama, Matsudaira Shimosa-no-kami-sama, Naito Kii-no-kami-sama, and the guard station at Baba-saki-gomon burned. Outside Soto-Sakurada-gomon and at Yamashita-gomon, Nabeshima-sama, Ito-sama, and Yanagisawa-sama burned. Sasshu-sama, Choshu-sama, and Mikusa Niwa-sama burned slightly.

Along Hitotsubashi-dori, Sashi-bashi-dori, Ogawa-cho, and around Sarugaku-cho, many daimyo residences large and small collapsed, with numerous houses damaged. Furthermore, due to fires, Hotta Bitchu-no-kami-sama, Matsudaira Buzen-no-kami-sama, and Naito-sama at Juji burned, while Toda-sama burned slightly. Many hatamoto residences in this area also burned. South of Nihonbashi-dori, at Azuma-bashi, Tatami-cho, Gorobei-cho, and around Take-cho riverbank, storehouses burned.

From Hon-Shiba Udagawa-cho to the eastern side, and at another fire source, Hon-jo Omote-cho burned slightly. In the third district, Midori-cho burned completely, and from the first to second districts burned. Similarly, from the fourth district to Yotsumeura-bashi area burned. Fukagawa Naka-cho-dori, beyond Ohashi, Yanagawa-cho Rokken-bori area, Morishita-cho, and Tokiwa-cho all burned completely, burning thoroughly up to Sendai-sama's gate.

At another fire source, Shitaya Kaya-cho and Sakamoto third district burned. Similarly, Hiro-koji, Ueno-cho, Daimon, and Choja-cho burned. Near Kaji-cho and Neribei-koji also burned. The fires subsided on the morning of the third day, and people felt relief. How fortunate!

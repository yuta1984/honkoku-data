Dora Nyorai's World Reform Choboukure

Yanre dora ga nyorai, yare sore sore sore, choboukure chongare! Now, the essential god residing in Kashima went out on worldly romantic affairs and departed for Izumo. During his absence, on the night of the second day around 10 PM, there was a blue and yellow flash of light. A tremendous flying object went from north to south. Taking this as a signal, "It's the end of the world, the age of final dharma!" - even hearing about earthquakes isn't amusing.

Not to mention the flowery Edo, from the eight Kanto provinces to the nearby districts, the earth cracked and mud spurted out. Large lucky charms fell from shelves - even when flipped over, tumbling about, or turned upside down like turtles, they stand up again. But when roof tiles and storehouse wall-mud fall, it's unbearable. Houses collapsed and fell down row by row. "This is terrible!" people cried, frantically fleeing.

Carrying beams and eaves on their backs, slipping and falling, hitting their knees, spraining arms and scraping legs, crying "It hurts, it hurts!" as they stumble through broken floors. From sleeping quarters, ladders came tumbling down in heaps. Fathers crawled out, grandmothers' backs gave out, cats jumped out, ladles bounced out. Inadvertently, glimpses of sisters' white inner thighs and black pubic hair were unbearable to see.

Huddling together in outdoor encampments, by morning one house was crushed, then two were crushed. In the Buddhist commotion, instead of proper coffins they used four-to barrels, tea chests, and sugar containers. Even worse were water buckets covered in blue-green algae slime that hadn't been cleaned off, frantically stuffed with bodies, transported by "heave-ho" carts and creaking boats - anything would do.

Temple priests made sour faces due to insufficient offerings. Forget about sutras or funeral rites - they didn't even strike the wooden fish drums or ring the half-bells, sending bodies straight to the crematory grounds as-is. This too caused congestion. With the great rush of Buddhist services like a popular theater ranking, if you don't wait ten days you can't get cremated, keeping the monks tremendously busy.

Then gradually the people in temporary camps, with backs chilled by the night wind, got heated in the head with some kind of rash, shoulders stiff and foreheads stinging. Suffering from women's troubles and headaches, catching colds. Sneezes came together with farts. Night dew and frost soaked nightwear and bedding thoroughly. In panic, actors departed on journeys, geishas only talked about warmed sake, courtesans hauled dirt - amid all this confusion about what to do, there was commotion about temporary housing.

Skilled courtesans, spinning around from below, when lifted up - customers complained bitterly about being fed up with that. Yare sore, chongare! Meanwhile, prices of rice and various goods dropped, foreign trade talks disappeared somewhere. With this, the world enjoyed bumper harvests. Dancing and celebrating, three family members and three lovers sleeping together, making money - how truly joyful and auspicious this is! Yare sore sore sore, kimyou chouurai, hohoui-i-i!

Regarding the Recent Events

Whether it be heaven's decree, regarding the origins of the great earthquake at Zenkoji Temple in Kawanakajima, Shinano Province:
On the night of the 24th day of the 3rd month of Koka 4, year of the fire sheep (1847), starting around 10 PM, it began shaking violently, and by noon of the 25th, it was still trembling intensely with sand and dust clouds rising in all directions. The terror was beyond words to describe. The shaking continued without cease, leaving everyone feeling barely alive. Around what seemed to be 3 PM, the main hall of Zenkoji Temple on Mount Teigaku collapsed sideways, followed by damage to Daimon-machi, Nishi-machi, Higashi-machi, and Gondo districts. In neighboring villages and in Echigo Province, areas extending to Takada and Imamachi, westward to Matsumoto, Ikeda, and Omachi, and the mountain towns and new settlements were all completely destroyed. Southward to the Ueda area, eastward to Ju-no-yu hot springs - roughly ten ri (40 km) in all directions. Beyond this, words and writing cannot adequately describe it.

The Great Sagami Earthquake

When heaven and earth undergo unusual changes, yin and yang mix to create thunder and rain, and when this enters the earth, it causes earthquakes. Alas, even the divine protection of gods and buddhas finds it difficult to quell such events. This occurred in the 6th year of Kaei, year of the ox (1853), from 4 PM to 9 PM on the 2nd day of the 2nd month, when a great earthquake struck.
In Sagami Province, Odawara, in the domain of Lord Okubo Kaga-no-kami: the castle town's Yorozu-machi, Hon-machi, Itabashi, Ryuji-machi street, Aomono-cho, Suwa-cho, Tera-machi, south of the castle, and Yagura - both samurai residences and townhouses suffered great damage. In nearby villages, areas around the Sakawa River, Suwa, Iizumi, Jumonji, Toka-ichiba, Koyasu, and Mount Oyama, Amafuri Gongen, mountain roads, along the Tokaido highway, Odawara, Tsukahata, Yamanaka, and many villages in Lord Okubo Nagato-no-kami's domain were damaged. At Hakone Yumoto's seven locations and around Mount Futago, within the sacred precincts of the local Gongen shrine (though the main shrine remained unharmed), flooding occurred and the area around Sai-no-kawara suffered great damage. From there, the coastal mountains of Izu Province, Manazuru, Atami, Ito, westward to Shuzenji and Mishima - many other places suffered great damage as well, though this account records only the general outline for your perusal.

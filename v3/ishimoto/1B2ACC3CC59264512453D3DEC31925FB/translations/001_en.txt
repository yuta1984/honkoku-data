(Upper right)
The fires of temporary dwellings fade
Luxury comes to a halt
New residences flourish

(Upper middle)
Water overflows from this
By the wicked catfish
Great nature is split apart

(Upper left)  
Stories hide poverty
Great houses lean and fall
The town retreats in sorrow

(Lower right)
Few watchmen remain
Rarely does anyone build
Exhausted by the staff of money

(Lower middle)
Officials are long busy
The lowest people grieve
Doctors have no time to weep

(Lower left)
The breath of evening vegetables
The joy of maidservants  
Dreams of the playful catfish

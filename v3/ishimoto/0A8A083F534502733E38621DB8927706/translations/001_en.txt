Proclamation from Kashima Divine Oracle to All Catfish

Item: Regarding the behavior of the catfish, which according to traditions passed down since the age of the gods should follow the sacred poem stating "nine brings illness, five-seven brings rain, four brings drought, six-eight brings wind," and should conduct themselves modestly while observing irregular weather patterns. However, taking advantage of the absence of the various deities during their journey to Izumo, they violated ancient rules and caused violent disturbances in and around the capital, shaking houses, storehouses, and people's bodies. Not only that, they also incited fires among their kind and burned down numerous locations without any particular wind. For this extremely wicked behavior as slimy landlords who fear not the eight million gods, they should be caught without exception using four-handed nets and subjected to bone removal and fire roasting at the eel-grilling establishments. However, by special divine authority, they are hereby banished from the entire divine realm. Therefore, should any of them hereafter approach the designated areas and engage in even the slightest tormenting behavior, they shall be immediately suppressed with the keystone, torn apart, and consumed as drinking accompaniments.

All people are watching in amazement. In any case, I am prepared to die in battle as soon as possible.
　　As for you, given the recent siege and the fact that you have sustained deep wounds in several places, it would be most prudent to
　　withdraw quickly to your domain without letting your guard down. No one would mock such a decision. I
　　have close connections with Ieyasu, and although Itakura Iga-no-kami has repeatedly sent me
　　private overtures, having divided loyalties goes against a warrior's true purpose. Though I feel somewhat ashamed,
　　living day by day like an ordinary person is unavoidable. Now then, please deliver this incense burner to
　　our elder sister. As for this sword, Ieyasu bestowed it upon me when I was thirteen years old as
　　a celebration for my coming-of-age ceremony. The messenger was Honda Heihachi, who said that Ieyasu treasured this
　　masterwork blade forged by Rai Kunitsugu. In numerous battles, I have never suffered
　　defeat while wielding this sword. Therefore I named it "Great Wave" and have carried it until today,
　　but now I present it to you. Please treasure it well. Though we are in the same castle, we cannot have even a moment
　　of peaceful conversation, remaining like strangers, which is most regrettable. Surely
　　our elder sister Lady Oteru must harbor resentment. This situation is not my fault. Please make appropriate excuses for me.
　　It cannot be helped. With fear and respect.

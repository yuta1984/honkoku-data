There are matters I must report. I believe you should be deeply concerned about these developments.

First, five or six days ago, a fire broke out from the corner of Shijo and Fuyacho. It burned from around 9:30 in the evening until past 7:00 the next morning, consuming the south side of Fuyacho street, from Ayanokoji to the back streets, both sides of the back streets and their rear areas, and from west Shijo to Tominokoji street. This too was an unusually large fire for this area.

First, the damage I have seen and heard about up to today:
The roof tiles falling from the Imperial Palace walls were enormous in number. The Imperial Library No. 13 suffered major damage. At Nijo Castle, the north side walls all collapsed inward toward the castle, and the western gates and walls also crumbled. One or two of the rice storehouses also collapsed. The damage to the regent houses and court nobles' residences within the palace grounds is beyond description. The turret of Yodo Castle also collapsed, they say. Of course, there are countless places where the ground has cracked throughout the various districts.

First, from the third day, prayers at various shrines were ordered.

First, I believe there will surely be a change of era name before long. Although there are thanksgiving pilgrimages to Ise, the auxiliary shrine at Ise has burned down, and with this great disaster on top of that, I pray earnestly that nothing more will happen hereafter. It is truly, truly frightening.

First, last month Lord Ogura Chujo died suddenly, and his father, Lord Chunagon, also died suddenly. For father and son to die suddenly within one month is indeed a rare occurrence.

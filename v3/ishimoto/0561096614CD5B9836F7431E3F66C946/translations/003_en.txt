There was much damage to corridor passages, folding screens, and the like, with all the outer boxes of official equipment scattered about. The southeastern and southwestern turrets and other structures had their white earth decorative bands peeled off and fallen. The stone walls, stone torii gates, and lanterns of the Inari shrine mostly collapsed - about three torii gates and sixteen to seventeen lanterns. The entrance gate to the Inari compound had its ridge beam fall, the stone walls crumbled, and passage became extremely dangerous. All the quarters of the dōshin (low-ranking samurai) in the Inari compound were destroyed, with about three dōshin escaping, and those who couldn't escape in time and were crushed were finally rescued. It is said their lives will likely be spared. From around 7:30, the earthquake intervals became longer, but there were occasional ground rumblings, and each time walls and roof tiles would fall and collapse in various places, though not severely enough to make all quarters uninhabitable - still, quite a few quarters became unlivable. With no place for people of all ranks to settle, everyone lost their composure and was at their wit's end. Though they went to rescue those crushed inside the quarters, there were two or three people who couldn't walk, but their lives will likely be spared. They were carried on wooden doors. There was looting from the disaster scene. With such anxiety about how strong the next earthquake might be, everyone's peace of mind was utterly disturbed. All those from the quarters gathered in open spaces, clustering together around tall lanterns and box lanterns. Around 6 o'clock (midnight), the magistrate suddenly came for an inspection.

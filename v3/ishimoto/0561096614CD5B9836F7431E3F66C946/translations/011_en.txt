Word came from Edo that he was to be relocated, and this news arrived in Kyoto on the same 22nd day, so
now there were no longer any obstacles, and the time had come. We firmly agreed to press forward with our long-planned
decisive action. I departed Kyoto on August 2nd and arrived in
Edo on the 10th of the same month, where we all held discussions. I would like to inform you of the details of this entire matter from beginning to end,
but as it involves extremely complicated circumstances, I cannot do so. However, since Sato Jozaemon
knows the complete details from beginning to end, I entrust this single sheet to him. After I go into
exile, please deliver word to Kawamura Chuemon. After this account, I deliberately cease
writing. This time, this serves as my farewell. I humbly and respectfully state this.

First, a bird called a fire bird or some such flew to the trees in Lord Nijo's garden and cried out, they say. With various strange occurrences like this being spoken of everywhere, everyone high and low is trembling with fear.
[Text omitted]
I wished to report the above matters to you immediately. I believe you must be particularly worried given the season. With fear and respect.
　　　　　　　Written on the night of July 4th　　　Fusa?
　　　　　　　To Matsuoka Seisuke-sama

First, a copy of the testament of Kimura Nagato-no-kami who is at Tamonin, a sub-temple of Daitsu Honzan at Rokusonno in Kyoto. The original document bears no personal seal.
　　　I write this letter to you. How is your recent injury? I spend my days and nights in an uneasy state of mind. You must have heard about it - it is completely unexpected and most distressing. The situation within the castle is extremely chaotic, but in any case, I believe the realm belongs to Ieyasu. Yesterday evening too, Ishikawa Higo-no-kami secretly came to my camp quarters. Both Ishikawa and I feel the same way about the deliberations and rumors within the castle. It is quite reasonable that we refuse to comply with any arrangements on our own authority due to orders from the Dowager. Regarding that matter, yesterday evening too, until the hour of seven we did not receive orders, so we went out to Shigino for tactical operations.

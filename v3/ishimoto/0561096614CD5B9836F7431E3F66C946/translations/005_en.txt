On the third day, they spent the entire day outside, and everyone is saying they only wish things would calm down now. The Tsuchimikado onmyōji (court astronomer) reported to the magistrate that there might still be strong earthquakes to come, so they should be on guard - such things are being said.

Since there are still tremors, we are prepared to camp outside again tonight. For now, I report these matters urgently. End.

However, this was something I had only seen in chronicles from about a hundred years ago, and I lost my composure - this was not just my own situation but that of all of Kyoto, and it shattered our nerves. The houses were fine, but the storehouses suffered great damage, so roof tiles scattered and fell, and moreover the foundation rings fell as well. From the night of the 2nd through the 3rd and now the 4th, there has been unbearable rumbling and shaking. Well now, somehow my mind cannot settle, and with such continuous trembling, this frightening situation that cannot be resolved continues indefinitely - it is beyond words. It is not the case that the local storehouses escaped damage. Moreover, our own storehouse collapsed and there were injuries...

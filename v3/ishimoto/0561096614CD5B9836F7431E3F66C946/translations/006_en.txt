Many people died instantly, and even now we do not know the exact number. In the vicinity of my residence, there are many injured adults and children - some struck by fallen earth from collapsed storehouses, others hit on the head by roof tiles, or injured by falling storehouse eaves. In the streets and thoroughfares, countless people were crushed under collapsed houses. There are many places where houses have crumbled. For two or three days, people spread tatami mats on the main roads to pass the nights, and tonight as well, most people are staying outside, so there is truly no peace of mind.

In the Imperial Palace, His Majesty was initially in the cooling pavilion, but then moved to the garden of the small palace (ko-gosho). The close attendants all spread tatami mats, drove in stakes, erected pillars, and stretched curtains, and from that night onward, His Majesty has remained in the garden, as Lord Hamuro, the Minister of the Left, related.

Furthermore, there are announcements that today, tomorrow, or in the near future, Kyoto will suffer a great fire. Not only throughout the town, but even within the palace grounds, people are preparing to evacuate at any moment. Since yesterday, many places have brought out their chests and storage boxes to their gates. Day and night, countless people pass by in great commotion, turning everything upside down. Today, I think only that because we still have our lives, we endure such daily hardships. I pray earnestly that from tomorrow onward there will be no extraordinary disasters or great calamities. Food and drink cannot be stored in the usual places. It feels like treading on thin ice. There are other matters I should report, but I will continue later...

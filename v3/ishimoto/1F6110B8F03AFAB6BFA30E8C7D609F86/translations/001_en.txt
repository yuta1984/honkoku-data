The Great Catfish of Shin-Yoshiwara: Its Origins

Butterfly, quickly poke its eyes out with a pipe! Swallowtail, hurry down and grab its whiskers!

This damned catfish, look at it~~~

Butterfly: "This catfish made off with the money I had saved up. Let's kill it and have Chosuke eat it!"

"Oh, how irritating! Being knocked around by this catfish, how hateful~~~"

"This catfish! Because of you I lost six hundred mon coins. In return, I'll kill you and eat you!"

"You bastard~~~~~"

"Quick, pull out these whiskers for me, it's so hateful!"

"We can't let this thing live, beat it to death with iron clubs~~~"

"Detestable giant catfish! You went on a rampage just when good customers were coming for the evening. Hateful catfish, beat it hard~~~"

"This catfish, what a disagreeable creature. It made my customers disappear somewhere. Give them back~~~"

Taiko: "This catfish! Because of you, this year is full of financial losses. Hurry up and kill it so we can eat it~~"

"Wait~~~, I stopped it~~~"

"Wait for me~~~"

"Hey~~~, don't hit it so hard~~~"

Catfish: "I'm happy to have you all riding on me~~~. If you ride like that, I'll lift you up again, I'll shake you. Is that okay~~~"

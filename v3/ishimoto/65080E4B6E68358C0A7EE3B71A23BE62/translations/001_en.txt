Natural disasters and abnormal changes in heaven and earth occur when yin and yang become confused - in heaven they manifest as thunder and rain, on earth as earthquakes. Even the protection of gods and buddhas finds it difficult to suppress these phenomena. Shinshū is Japan's premier highland province, with dozens of districts totaling 557,300 koku, making it a first-class province with many mountains and rivers, where people live simply, famous products abound, and the five grains flourish. However, for whatever reason, from the night of the 24th day of the third month of Kōka 4 (1847), an unprecedented great earthquake changed mountains and rivers, destroyed temples, shrines, and houses, caused many deaths of people and horses, and brought suffering from fires and floods. I record here in detail the calamities of villages and hamlets, and show this to make known to future generations the national benevolence of relief for good people through the compassionate governance of the authorities above.

The third month had unusually warm weather for several days. On the night of the 24th at the hour of the Dog (around 10 PM), suddenly mountain rumbling and trembling began. The area around Zenkō-ji was particularly severe. Rather than calling it an earthquake, great mountains collapsed and fell, water overflowed, and the earth roared underground. The ground split five sun to one shaku, or five shaku to one jō, and black and red mud gushed forth while flame-like phenomena burned upward. The main hall, guest quarters, kitchen, treasure house, and people of the temple's eighteen districts - West Eight Districts, East Eight Districts, Iwaseki, Sakura-kōji, Gondō-chō - were all shaken and destroyed. At the inns Hatago-ya, Fuji-ya, Heizaemon, and Heigōrō, approximately 720 men and women lodgers died, along with about 1,800 other inn guests of all ages and genders, about 1,070 local people, and 184 prostitutes from Gondō-chō - all died instantly. Those who had taken refuge in the main hall that night, or who desperately chanted the Buddha's name and rushed into the hall, escaped that night's great disaster. This clearly demonstrates the vast benefits of the sacred Amida Buddha image transmitted from the three countries, as is known throughout the world. It should be revered.

[The text continues with detailed descriptions of the earthquake's effects across various districts, damage assessments, casualty figures, relief efforts by officials, and concludes with administrative information about local officials and lords.]

At the end, there is a note about a separate incident on the 13th day of the first month of Kōka 4, in the domain of Matsudaira Hōki-no-kami in Tango Province, Takeno District, Ikuno Village, where a large farmer named Gonzaemon experienced the overnight appearance of a great mountain on his land, along with a large hole over ten ken wide and thirty-five ken deep, plus a blue stone measuring three ken nine shaku with a height of one jō two shaku eight sun, all appearing simultaneously in one night.

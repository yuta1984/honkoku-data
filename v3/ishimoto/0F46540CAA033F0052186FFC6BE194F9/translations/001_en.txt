At the sacred site of Yakuōzan Tōkōji Temple in Kumano Hongū Yunomine, there is Japan's premier hot spring. The Buddhist statue of Yakushi Nyorai (Medicine Buddha) naturally appeared through hot spring deposits. In ancient times, hot spring water gushed forth from the Buddha's chest, and traces of this can still be seen on the chest. The attendant bodhisattvas Nikkō and Gakkō, along with the Twelve Divine Generals, are works created by Kōbō Daishi (Kūkai).

Regarding this hot spring, there is a tale from long ago about a man named Oguri Hangan who was harmed by poisoned sake. After bathing in this hot spring for one full year, his serious illness was completely cured. After his recovery, wanting to test his own strength, he easily pressed small, jewel-like stones into large rocks. Since then, this stone has been called "Oguri's Power Stone."

Also, while Oguri was bathing in the hot spring, he bound his hair with straw and discarded the straw in a certain place. To this day, rice naturally grows there every year without being planted. This is called "the rice that grows without sowing." It is located about three chō north of Yunomine, beside the road. We now present illustrations of both the rice that grows without sowing and the power stone to show to all people.

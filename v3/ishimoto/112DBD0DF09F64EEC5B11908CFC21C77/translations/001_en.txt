The second day of October
was a very auspicious day,
corresponding to the Kyoshuku constellation of the twenty-eight lunar mansions,
and the time was the hour of the Boar,
so according to Buddhist teachings,
an earthquake on this day at this time
is called "Taishaku's movement,"
and its sign is very auspicious,
as was written in
an ancient book.

Release the catfish's eye,
shake and disturb
the eel "Nura-zo,"
and open the mouth
of the collapsed
gold.

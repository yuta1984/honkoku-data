The Story of the Great Collapse of Mount Bandai in Aizu

[Upper Section]
Even in wide Japan, this famous
1. Great commotion at Mount Bandai in Aizu
Terrifying to hear and tell

At the foot are five villages, and beyond
2. The turmoil spread six ri in all directions
The number of instant deaths countless

Terrifying to see, this commotion
3. Mount Bandai split completely in two
Fire and smoke rise up from below

Hell truly exists in this world
4. This eruption, is it hell?
The state of people's suffering

However hellish it may be
5. In this world, thirty-six villages
All at once in the agony of eruption

Cruel thing, this Bandai
6. The people of that time, most
Pitifully, their number was 150

The bottom of hell is this very thing
7. Even those with wives and children
Parted from this world without seeing their death

Mountains collapse to become fields
8. Fields are buried to become mountains
Stones shatter to become gravel

A great commotion rare in history
9. Stones rain down from heaven
Flames rise up from below

The thundering earth like 108
10. Thunder gods
No one felt alive

[Lower Section]
From Hibara, Okawa, to Kogawa
11. Waterways blocked, fields too
Reservoirs and embankments all destroyed

Being a sudden commotion
12. Parents and children scattered and fled
A tale of survival

When it collapsed terribly
13. On the 15th of mid-July
Past eight o'clock in the morning

Black smoke in all directions
14. Even birds and beasts all killed
Enough to make one's hair stand on end

Terror that makes the body shrink
15. The sadness of parting from wife and children
The pathos of parent and child separation

Though the sixty-four provinces are vast
16. The great commotion of Mount Bandai
Limitlessly pitiful to see

But there is one strange thing
17. In Hibara village, a single person
An eighty-year-old grandmother

From spring, raising
18. One wild boar with great care
This boar wished to repay the kindness

Tilting its head, this boar
19. Though it cannot speak, shows with its eyes
Takes her sleeve in its mouth and leads her away

Escaping the sudden great disaster
20. How joyful, safe and sound, grandmother
Could such turmoil exist in this world?

It was the third year of Kōka, hinoe-uma (1846),
on the 15th day of the first month, around the eighth hour of the day (around 3 PM),
when a fire broke out
in the Hongō Maruyama area.
The entire vicinity of
Kanda Myōjin Shrine
was burned, though Myōjin Shrine
itself survived. The northwest
wind was fierce, and
Shōhei Bridge burned and collapsed. From there,
the area below Myōjin burned, but the fire was
stopped at Sakuma-chō. In one direction, sparks flew to Surugadai,
and the entire area around Imagawa Bridge was consumed by fire.
From there, Honchō-dōri, Nihonbashi, and Edo Bridge
collapsed. The area around Eitai Bridge, Reigan Island,
Teppōzu, and Tsukuda Island. In another direction,
Yonchōme and the area around Naka Bridge were completely burned.
At Kyōbashi Takegashi, finally at the ninth hour (around noon),
the fire finally subsided, and people
felt relief and peace of mind.

From the fire's origin to its furthest point [map omitted]: over 1 ri and 10 chō
Number of districts: over 580 residential districts

Regarding this great fire and its spread,
the honorable government established relief huts
and furthermore provided
meals for each person. This truly shows
the benevolent virtue [of the authorities], and how
fortunate are those
who live in this era.

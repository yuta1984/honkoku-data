○On the night of November 5th, at half past six in the evening (around 7 PM), bridges that fell due to the tsunami:
○From the west of Dotonbori River: Hiyoshi Bridge, Shiomi Bridge, Saiwai Bridge, Sumiyoshi Bridge
○Horie River: Mizuwake Bridge, Iron Bridge ○West Yokobori: Kanaya Bridge
○Ajikawa Bridge ○Kamei Bridge ○Tamatsu Bridge - eleven bridges in total
○The tsunami surged up at Tempozan, and since both fishermen and private houses in this area were flooded, everyone fled up to Tempozan. Private houses suffered great damage, and small houses collapsed and were swept away. Water rushed into all the newly reclaimed rice fields in this area, so farming families each fled up to the embankments. Afterward, everyone built temporary huts on top of the embankments and lived in them.

Complete diagram of the Ikitsuki Misaki warehouse complex

An ancestor of Masutomi named Dōki established the whaling industry after carefully considering the geography of Ikitsuki Misaki. Since then, whale traffic has remained frequent, and fishing profits have been very substantial. The method involves using the waters off Kei Island as the netting grounds, placing mountain lookouts at various locations (watchtowers are positioned on high ground to observe whale movements from afar), and dispatching sea patrols (scout boats that row out two to three ri offshore to observe whale behavior).

The warehouse complex is arranged with a whale beaching area prepared on the front beach, buildings and storehouses built in rows, stone walls constructed all around for strict enclosure, gates on both sides with guards posted. Even outside the enclosure, there are guard huts in various places where night watchmen stay awake, occasionally beating drums as signals for security. When whales are caught, patrol personnel circulate day and night without rest, maintaining strict security.

The buildings constructed here include: one net warehouse, one warehouse for smithy/nets/carpentry/barrels, one red meat warehouse, one east storehouse/whale baleen storehouse, two tendon warehouses, one fiber storehouse, one salt storehouse, one large warehouse, one oil jar facility, one small warehouse, one small warehouse storehouse, one bone warehouse, one accounting warehouse, one carpentry warehouse, one tools warehouse, one rice storehouse, one new tendon storehouse, one oar warehouse, one small oil storage building, one six-bay oil storage building, one eight-bay miscellaneous goods storage building, one harpoon warehouse, thirty crew warehouses, eight windlasses, and so forth.

The art of whaling fundamentally requires assessing geographical advantages as most essential. With good geography, one can achieve great results and thick profits with little labor and expense. Geographical advantage refers to locations with heavy whale traffic that are convenient for net deployment. Semiwhales limit themselves to about eighteen fathoms of sea depth and do not dive deeper, so they can be netted even in deep offshore waters. However, humpback whales, fin whales and others travel to very deep bottoms, beyond the reach of nets. Therefore, locations where eighteen-fathom nets can reach the seabed are selected as netting grounds, arranged so that not only semiwhales but also humpbacks and fin whales cannot escape. Next, the primary focus is on assessing the geography of whale beaching areas, warehouse and building sites, boat mooring places, mountain lookout and sea patrol positions, firewood storage areas, and net drying grounds.

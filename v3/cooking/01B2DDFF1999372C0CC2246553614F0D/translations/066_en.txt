**Feathered Arrow Harpoon Complete Diagram (haneya-mori zendzu)**
The blade is 2 shaku 1 sun long, the shaft is made of oak wood and measures 1 jō 2 shaku, with a 13-fathom arrow rope attached. The blade is made of soft iron. This feathered arrow harpoon is used for long-distance and quick actions. It is thrown and thrust from about 8 to 9 ken away.

When whales are reluctant to enter the nets, thrusting with the feathered arrow harpoon will startle the whale and cause it to enter the net. Alternatively, when a whale escapes from the net, thrusting with the feathered arrow harpoon will cause the whale to hesitate momentarily, at which time several harpoons can be thrust to capture it. Also, when capturing a whale with calf, the feathered arrow harpoon is first thrust into the calf to half-kill it, then the parent whale is taken.

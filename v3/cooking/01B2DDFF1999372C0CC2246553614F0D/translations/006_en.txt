Complete Map of Ikitsuki Island

Ikitsuki Island is a subordinate island of Hirado, located about three ri offshore to the west of the castle town.
It extends about three ri from north to south and about thirty chō from east to west, forming a narrow and long island. The eastern and southeastern 
seas are close to land with calm waves, but the northwest faces distant Korea across
the vast ocean whose limits are unknown. The coast is carved like standing folding screens, and 
the sight of great waves crashing violently against it is indescribably terrifying. Therefore, there are
no convenient harbors for ships, and few human dwellings. Toward the southeast, there are Tachi-ura,
Ichibu-ura, Misaki-ura, and other settlements, as well as some harbors.
In this Ichibu-ura lives Masutomi Matazaemon, a man from a generations-old wealthy family, who has a
reputation for being sincere and gentle. He makes whaling his livelihood and directs fishing operations at various locations. These are within the domain:
Maeme in Iki Province (two groups in winter, one in summer), Katsumoto (two groups in winter, one in spring), Misaki on Ikitsuki Island (one group in winter, one in spring), Enoshima in Ōmura domain
(one group in spring, moving from Maeme), and Itabe in Gotō domain (one group in spring, moving from Katsumoto) - a total of five fishing stations with
the corresponding groups deployed. (Within Hirado domain, there are also fishing grounds at Ojika Island with one winter group and Tsuyoshi-ura with one spring group, but these are not under Masutomi's direction. Winter groups refers to catching descending whales from ten days before Minor Cold until ten days before the equinox.
Spring groups refers to catching ascending whales from ten days before the equinox until about twenty days after the end of spring doyō.) This management is no easy task,
and without the power of wealth, how could one cover the expenses? Even if capital were
sufficient, without the proper capacity, how could one oversee the numerous
fishermen and craftsmen? The reason for taking up Ikitsuki Island and recording it in this illustrated text is that among all places, this island is
closest to the castle town, where one can see and hear the facts firsthand, and moreover it is the residence
of group leader Masutomi, so matters are well organized there. (What appears distant to the west in the map are the
islands of Gotō. Also, what is called Bandake
is where a lookout post for foreign ships is established, keeping watch day and night.)

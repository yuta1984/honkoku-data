**Complete Diagram of Hand-Hold Knife**
When a whale is caught in the nets, struck with countless harpoons, and cut with swords until it is half-dead and half-alive, the harpooner takes this knife and leaps onto the whale. For the back fin whale, they cut vertically in the shape of a leather body piece at two locations: about one fathom above the blowhole and about one fathom below it. This is called "hand-hold cutting." For large right whales, they cut the blowhole and also make hand-holds. For fin whales, only the blowhole is cut. After successfully making these cuts as described, when the knife is raised above the head as a signal, the harpooners jump in with ropes called "partition hooks," thread them through the aforementioned holes, and tie them to the main paired boats. For whale calves, neither the blowhole partition nor hand-holds are cut—they are simply killed by stabbing.

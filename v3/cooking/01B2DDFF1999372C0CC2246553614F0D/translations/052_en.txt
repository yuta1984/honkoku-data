Called ko-kujira (child whale). In the whale illustrations of Kii Province, it appears that it is also called "chigo-kujira." "Ko" (child) probably means small. Since this whale is the smallest and most slender among whales, it was perhaps named the child whale. There are two types: Ao-sagi and Share. Their shape and color are the same and difficult to distinguish. Only the Ao-sagi has a sharper "shinogi." Shinogi refers to places near the tail below the back that have frequent undulations. The shape closely resembles the right whale but is much smaller. The color is light black with a slight blue tint. Along the back there are semicircular and circular spotted patterns. The baleen is white, about one shaku five to six sun long, about three sun wide, and two to three bu thick. This is called white baleen and is used for fan pivots and such. Ao-sagi oil burns particularly long, and one lamp's worth of oil lasts through a winter night. The taste is also good. This whale has a rough temperament and even when caught in nets will break through them, or even damage ships, so they are mostly not caught with nets but harpooned and captured. Share in particular has a fierce and evil temperament. Large ones measure over three fathoms from blowhole to the boundary of large bone and round cut, with a total length of over six fathoms. Small ones are over two fathoms with a total length of about four fathoms. They feed on crabs and sea slugs. Those seven fathoms long can yield about one hundred twenty to thirty barrels of oil.

Right Whale Calf [Boxed]
This is an illustration of a fetus at about four months. Total length is about two shaku six to seven sun, with a girth of about two shaku. The nose tip and eye area are mouse-colored, while the rest is peach-colored. All whales give live birth to a single offspring.

Right whale calves are light mouse-colored for about one month after birth. These are called "white calves." After one month passes and within that year when the color becomes somewhat black, they are called "black calves." Once they become one-year or three-year calves, it becomes difficult to distinguish their age. Right whale calves are considered full whales from the white calf stage onward. The growth of calves is extremely rapid. Calves born in October and November reach a total length of five to six fathoms by the following March. Those about seven fathoms long have been weaned and are thin with no oil. From about nine fathoms they gradually become fat. Right whale calves are seven to eight shaku at birth. Humpback whale calves are two to three fathoms, which is large compared to right whales.

【Illustration】Fin Whale [Boxed]
"Nagasu" probably means long-bodied. Its form is slender and long. What people say about thirty-three fathoms probably refers to the large specimens of this whale. Its nature is robust, strong, and enduring, and it usually stays submerged on the ocean floor and rarely surfaces, making it very difficult to catch. There are two types: Shiro-nagasu (white fin whale) and Nitari. Their shape is the same, but the white fin whale has white coloring while Nitari is gray. The snout is pointed, flat, and long, with small dorsal fins below the back. There are many horizontal wrinkles from the lower jaw to the belly area. The baleen is short like that of the humpback whale. The taste is inferior. Both back and belly have thin skin of about two to three sun. The oil freezes in winter and burns poorly. Large ones have a total length of eighteen to nineteen fathoms from mouth tip to tail tip at the three-way junction. Medium ones have a total length of fourteen to fifteen fathoms. Small ones have a total length of about ten fathoms. Only for this fin whale do they not measure from the blowhole, but take the total length from mouth tip to tail tip. They prefer to eat sardines. Those fifteen fathoms long are said to yield about four hundred barrels of oil.

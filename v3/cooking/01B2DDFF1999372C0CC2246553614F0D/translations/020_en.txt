Illustration of spotting descending whales in the western offshore waters of Misaki, Ikitsuki

In the dialect of the Saikai region, there are terms "nobori-kujira" (ascending whales) and "kudari-kujira" (descending whales). Those that migrate to southern waters to avoid the cold air of northern seas in winter are called descending whales, and those that migrate to northern waters during the warm spring season are called ascending whales. {{Side note: Ascending whales have fierce temperaments and travel in groups through offshore waters, making it difficult to separate and capture them. In the spring warmth, they do not listen to any sounds and cannot be driven into nets, so they are mostly caught by harpooning.}} Among them, four types are regularly hunted: sebi whales (right whales), nagasu whales, and ko-whales (young whales). Other whales are extremely rare and not worth mentioning. The illustration shown here depicts sebi whales migrating southward through the western offshore waters of Misaki. Sebi whales float and swim on the water surface, spouting water to a height of about two ken (approximately 3.6 meters), split into two streams. Compared to other whales, their breathing intervals are short, and they spout frequently at brief intervals.

When the mountain lookouts spot them, they raise mat signals on poles standing nearby, {{side note: Four mats sewn together like a sail are hoisted up on standing poles as signal markers}} or light smoke signals. Then the driving boats, twin-oar boats, support boats, or guard boats row out regardless of wind and waves. Once they confirm it is definitely a sebi whale, each boat raises a flag on its bow. The locations are as follows:

Hikusa {{side note: Ikitsuki Island, one guard boat}}, Nagori {{side note: same location, one guard boat}}, Kurama {{side note: same location, two driving boats, two support boats, one guard boat}}, Takari {{side note: same location, one guard boat from around the end of winter doyo period}}, Whale Island {{side note: same location, six twin-oar boats, six auxiliary twin-oar boats, three driving boats, two support boats, Mae-Takari during rough weather}}, Danna-yama {{side note: same location, behind Misaki, one guard boat from 14-15 days before spring group}}, Ikari-yama {{side note: same location, behind Bandake, spring group, no guard boats}}, Horse Head {{side note: Oshima, no guard boats}}, Oga {{side note: same location, two guard boats}}, Shirasaki {{side note: same location, one guard boat}}, Sakise {{side note: Taku Island, one guard boat}}, Kanzaki {{side note: same location, one guard boat at Yoko Island during rough weather}}

The driving boats and twin-oar boats position themselves around Whale Island, Kurama, and Mae-Takari depending on weather conditions, with one signal person and one stern pusher going up to the mountain lookout posts to observe. The patrol boats are positioned with five boats between Whale Island and Futagami in winter, and when weather is calm, they line up in stages from about five ri (approximately 20km) offshore toward land for surveillance. In spring, three boats are positioned from Takari's offshore to the area overlooking Tsushima, and when weather is calm, they line up in stages from about two ri (approximately 8km) offshore toward land for surveillance. All return to shore by evening. There are three routes for descending whales: those coming from Oshima's offshore are called "Oya-iri," those coming between Oshima and Taku Island are called "Hakama Seto-otoshi," and those coming between Taku Island and Kanzaki are called "Ta-no-ura-otoshi." This illustration depicts the Oya-iri route.

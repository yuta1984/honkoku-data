Diagram of harpooning a right whale with the first harpoon and second harpoon and raising signal flags off Cape Misaki of Ikitsuki Island

Although the whale is caught in the net, it still tries to escape, surfacing outside the circle of boats and spouting water as it breathes. Not to be outdone, we row closer, and the harpooners stand up at the bow, twist their harpoons, and throw them from a distance of four or five ken (about 7-9 meters), whereupon the yorozu harpoon pierces deep into the whale. After striking with the first yorozu and second yorozu, they raise flags on the stern of the boat and continue striking with yorozu harpoons until two or three, or even three or four harpoons are embedded. Then the whale dives to the ocean floor to escape. At this time, they extend the ropes called neso, kagasu, and shirase attached to the yorozu for dozens of fathoms, allowing them to be pulled out as the whale drags them. The yorozu is made of soft iron with a turnip-shaped tip, so it bends but does not break, and cannot be pulled out no matter how hard the whale tries, leaving it no way to escape. Some whales surface again shortly after, while others surface after about half an hour. When the whale surfaces, each crew waits and strikes with yorozu harpoons, causing it to weaken and suffer, its groaning voice like thunder. The sea surface turns to blood, with vermillion-colored waves rising and churning. Even during such agony, these are gentle-natured fish, and right whales in particular are calm, so they do not thrash about wildly and damage the boats. As the whale dives and tries to escape in the sea, they let it pull the boat along, following it, and each time it surfaces, they throw yorozu harpoons at it. When it has weakened in this way, they prepare for the "sword cutting," aligning their blade tips and waiting in readiness - a sight so terrifying it makes one's hair stand on end.

*Sword cutting refers to when harpooners see that a whale has been entangled in nets and weakened by harpoons, they transfer to the mochi-futami boat and each wield swords to stab it repeatedly.

Depending on the whale's nature, those that do not get caught even when driven close to the nets are struck with haya-mori (quick harpoons), causing them to panic and swim into the nets. Those that break through the nets and try to escape are pursued and struck with haya harpoons, and when they become startled and confused, hesitating, they are captured - this is considered an achievement that each crew member strives for, and they can receive rewards for it.

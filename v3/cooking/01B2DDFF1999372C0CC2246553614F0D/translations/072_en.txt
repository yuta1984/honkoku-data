Beginning with Zhang Heng's "Rhapsody on the Western Capital," whales appear in many works. For males, characters like 鯨 (kei), 䲔 (kei), and ■ [fish radical + 敬] are used interchangeably, while for females the character 鯢 (gei) is employed. Liu Xin's "Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital" even records the historical episode of Emperor Wu's stone whale. In Buddhist scriptures, they appear in numerous places in works such as the Maharatnakuta Sutra, the Amoghapasha Sutra, the Buddhacarita Sutra, and other doctrinal texts on philosophy, precepts, and biography. What the Mahaprajnaparamita Sastra calls "Makara Fish King," the Collection of Translated Names identifies as whale fish, and the New Materia Medica also shows the Japanese name for makara as "kujira."

Although whales were thus described as awesome and wondrous creatures, the methods for catching and eating them were probably unknown. The materia medica texts generally do not discuss such matters. How exactly were whales hunted in ancient times? In the middle period, they used bows for shooting and spears for stabbing, but when netting techniques developed, harpoons came to be used. "Mori" (harpoon) is probably named for the meaning of staying in position and striking at the target.

According to one theory, until around the Meio era, fishermen from Kumano in Kii Province would come down to Shiozu Bay in Iki to make whale hunting their livelihood. Because they worshipped the shrine of Ebisu Saburo-dono as their tutelary deity there, the place came to be called Ebisu Bay. This was an unparalleled whale netting ground, but later a fisherman named Fukazawa from Omura in Hizen Province inherited this trade and eventually began the technique of organized netting. Around the Kanbun and Enpo eras, it became widely practiced, and many places began using organized netting.

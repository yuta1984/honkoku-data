[Diagram of harpooning a pregnant right whale off Cape Misaki in Ikitsuki]

Whales have deep affection for their young. Among them, right whales are the most devoted. When a pregnant whale is caught in nets, first a harpoon is thrust into the calf, which is then secured to the boat with nets and ropes. By doing this, even if the mother whale escapes the net and distances herself by two or three ri, she will inevitably return upon hearing her calf's cries and will not leave its side. While she tries to break the securing rope with her fins, the hunters spread nets around her again and drive her closer to capture her. Even if she escapes the nets again, as long as the calf is not dead, she will return many times trying to rescue it. When she realizes the calf has died, she gives up and abandons it to flee.

There are also "pincer young" - calves swimming between male and female whales. When fishermen see this, they first harpoon the calf. When the calf weakens and they know it cannot be saved, the male abandons it and leaves, but the female still carries it on her fin, showing pity - reminiscent of the examples of the pheasant in the burning field and the crane at night.

Pregnant beaked whales are fierce by nature and damage nets, so using only harpoons, they first strike the calf, then the mother. As she thrashes about wildly, several boats chase her and thrust many harpoons into her. At this time, the mother beaked whale mistakes the boats for her calf, and the young beaked whale mistakes the boats for its mother, bumping against the boat bottoms and often severely damaging the vessels.

Now, regarding the "sword cutting" technique (the sword cutting method was already explained in the previous section): fat whales may be struck over a hundred times, while thin ones may die from just two or three harpoons. Once dead, they immediately become "sinking whales" that are difficult to raise with human strength alone. Therefore, while half-dead and half-alive, one hazashi (swimmer) takes a hand-cutting knife and leaps onto the whale's head, rising and sinking with its movements, and cuts through the blowhole's partition. When this cutting is finished, he raises the knife above his head as a signal. Then another hazashi, holding a blowhole-fishing rope, dives into the sea, threads the rope through the hole that was cut open, returns, and secures it to the boat. It is said that observing the timing before the whale becomes a sinking whale is crucial.

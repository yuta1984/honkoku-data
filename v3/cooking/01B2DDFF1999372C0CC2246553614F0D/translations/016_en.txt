Illustration of craftwork at the storehouse area in front of Misaki, Ikitsuki

Before the whaling fleet departure (kumide), various craftsmen prepare all kinds of equipment and tools. Some pound the rice rations, others repair the storehouses, and beyond that, accounting work is busy. The necessary items are as follows:

Ships (as recorded previously) Nets (123 tan) Oar blades (540 pieces) Sails (26 pieces) Rudders (34 pieces)
Masts (34 pieces) Crossbeams (50 pieces) Paddles (34 pieces) Grappling hooks (44 pieces) Water barrels (26 pieces)

Swords (45 pieces) Hand-shaped knives (40 pieces) Large cutting knives (number variable) Clearing knives (number variable)
Small cutting knives (300 pieces) Axes (number variable) Mountain knives (50 pieces) Sinew knives (number variable) Rib scrapers (number variable)
Hook poles (number variable) Vises (number variable) Subaru tools (number variable) Metal clubs (number variable) Chisels (50 pieces)

Charcoal (400 bales) Rice (2,500 bales for fleet rations) Miso soybeans (100 bales) Sake (160 barrels)
Oil storage barrels (2,000) Salt (2,000 bales) Standing mats (5,000 pieces) Straw sandals (10,000 pairs) Cutting tubs (number variable)
Sinew tubs (number variable) Water tubs (number variable) Cooking tubs (number variable) Signal tubs (number variable) Long handles (number variable)
Brazier tubs (number variable) Wash basins (number variable) Hemp fiber (over 16,000 kin)

Besides these, there are various other tools and equipment, but small items are omitted due to lack of space to record them all.

The above ship equipment recorded in the preliminary work section is for one Misaki group. Since Iki's four groups use large net operations, their equipment is three times that of Misaki. When combined with Omura's Enoshima and Goto's Itabe, one can deduce that the amount of equipment would be enormous.

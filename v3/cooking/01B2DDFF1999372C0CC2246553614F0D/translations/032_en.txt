Diagram of harpooning and towing a whale to Misaki Bay in Ikitsuki
Having captured a whale in the open sea and secured it between two support vessels, numerous towing boats display their banners and form two rows as they approach Misaki Bay - a truly heartening sight to behold. Meanwhile, when another whale is spotted, the mountain lookouts raise their customary mat signals, wave their command batons, or light signal fires. Seeing these signals, the driving boats divide their efforts and pursue the newly arrived whale. The support vessels that have secured the whale gradually row closer, and as they near Misaki Bay, they raise their rowing voices and create a great clamor. Hearing this, hundreds of workers from the processing stations respond with "etariya-ou," beating drums and joining their voices. Soon they launch relay boats, and the offshore crew, serving as receivers, equip themselves with fish-cutting tools and arrange large cutting knives in impressive fashion. They meet the whale about two or three chō offshore to receive it, handle all arrangements, and tow it to the beach. After the whale has been towed in this manner, the sea surface becomes stained with blood and turns vermillion, attracting countless flocks of kites, crows, gulls, and rai birds (mentioned in the Shōji Hyakushu poetry collection). The rai bird particularly favors whales, following them from far out at sea, and when the whale is butchered on the beach, a single rai can consume about four to five kin of meat. However, the fishermen call these birds "Ebisu" and cherish them, never driving them away no matter how much meat they consume. Perhaps the name "rai bird" derives from their role in indicating the arrival of whales. There are also rai birds at Mount Hakusan in Koshi Province, about which Retired Emperor Go-Toba composed: "Hidden in the shade of pines on white mountain, peacefully dwelling rai birds." The ones at Hakusan may be similar to the birds called "shōkeirai-bu" in China. The current whale-loving bird is the albatross (according to Tenseki Binran and Komado Zasshitsu) and is a different species.

Method: First prepare good
bonito dashi stock and
mix with soy sauce in
proper proportion.
Beat eggs well and combine with the above dashi-soy sauce mixture. Then put seasonings
in teacups, pour the above broth
to 80% full and steam.
Seasonings may be anything
to your liking. Do not limit yourself to
what is mentioned here. In any case, keep the water
at a good rolling boil.

【Second Tier】
Mix with the above ground fish paste,
thin to proper consistency and pour
to 80% full and steam—
same as steamed custard.
For the above egg white custard too,
when grinding fish meat,
it's good to add a little
egg white. Steaming well, the
finish is also very good.
○For steamed custard and egg white
custard, the steaming
time is most important. For steamed custard,
plan on eighteen eggs
for ten servings.

【Third Tier】
Good. When finished steaming, transfer to other

covered dishes and
serve with kudzu starch sauce poured over.
〽Grated wasabi, ginger, sansho pepper
and similar seasonings are good.
○Using the above method with dashi
soy sauce thinly
prepared as steamed custard
is also good.
○Egg white seasonings and egg white
dishes—for all of these, whether
firm or soft, the
thinning consistency is most important.

【Fourth Tier】
Ginkgo nuts　Wasabi

Besides the above, any seasonings are

serve as is with sauce poured over.
Also good to steam any number
in steaming baskets, then
transfer to confection bowls or
teacups with sauce poured over
or sauce underneath—
either way is good.

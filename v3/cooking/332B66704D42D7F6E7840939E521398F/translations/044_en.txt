Kinton: Mix kudzu flour with strained and mashed
miso soup, let it cool and knead it. Mix in ground sansho pepper
and other seasonings, shape into flat rounds. This is also
prepared with miso soup. There are additional oral traditions for this.

Soba-kiri: Knead with rice washing water, which is good. Or
use warm water. Sometimes tofu is ground and kneaded with water.
Make the dough balls small. When boiling,
too little water is bad. After they are cooked, scoop them up with a colander
and put them in warm water to rinse lightly.
Then put them in the colander, pour hot cooking water over them, cover with a lid so they don't
cool down, and serve without excess water.
The broth is the same as udon. Additionally, daikon radish juice

may be added. Dried bonito shavings, scallions, and spicy
wasabi may also be added.

Mugi-kiri: This uses barley flour. The preparation method is the same
as cut wheat - roll it out and cut it short. For broth and toppings,
prepare it like soba-kiri.

Nyumen: Cut fine somen noodles short, boil them and
rinse lightly, set aside. Add dashi to miso and
put in a deep pot. Small vegetables, leeks, eggplant, etc. may be added.
It can also be prepared with thin miso. Black pepper and sansho pepper powder.

Susuri-dango: Take flour made from six parts glutinous rice and four parts regular rice,
knead softly with water, form into fist-sized balls,
cook well in strained adzuki bean liquid with a little salt.

There are such cases　Generally for namasu, the proper vinegar seasoning is when
　　　all the namasu is served and there is not much vinegar left over afterward
　　　That is the proper balance
Konoshiro namasu　Prepare it like crucian carp and it is good
Yamabuki-ae　This means mixing crucian carp namasu
　　　without adding mustard
Hideri namasu　Scale sweet sea bream into three pieces
　　　Slice the flesh thinly　Put both skins together and
　　　grill from the skin side, chop and add　Cut taro stems into
　　　thin strips, season with vinegar and salt and mix　This is what it means
　　　The skin is also grilled plain
Kawayaki namasu　Prepare sweetfish like sweet sea bream
　　　This also involves slicing the flesh thinly　Grill the skin plain
Nuta namasu　Grind mustard well, then grind
　　　sake lees well　Whether sweetfish, sardines, or greens,
　　　first stir-fry with vinegar, discard that vinegar, then thin the nuta
　　　with vinegar, season with salt and mix　Too much vinegar afterward
　　　is bad　However, for sweetfish there is also adding chopped
　　　boiled leaves to green bean nuta and mixing
Tarosuke namasu　Lightly salted sea bream, abalone etc.
　　　slice as thinly as possible　Mix with equal parts toasted sake and vinegar
　　　However, add abalone later, which is good　Trout
　　　sake is also good　Hanakatsuba, March daikon, wood ear mushroom
　　　etc. chopped and added are good

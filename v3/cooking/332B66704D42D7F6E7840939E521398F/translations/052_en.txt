　　　Mix these two colors together, steam softly, and spread evenly to a thickness of about five bu
　　　without lumps. Sprinkle two go five shaku of wheat flour above and below
　　　and let ferment. When the mold grows well, break it up coarsely,
　　　dry slightly in the sun, being careful not to let the mold scatter,
　　　then put in paper bags and store. At any time, five days
　　　before use, add four go of koji, two go five shaku of salt, and one sho of water to make it.
　　　In winter, ten to fifteen days ahead is good. Boil the koji, salt and water
　　　vigorously, let cool well, put in either a tub
　　　or jar, place in sunlight, and stir five or six times
　　　per day. Leave outside until it develops color. However, if making five sho

　　　worth, add three go of salt each time - this is good.

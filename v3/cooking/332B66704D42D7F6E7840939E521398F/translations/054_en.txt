This volume on cooking does not follow the formal methods of
knife work and cutting techniques, but is simply made according to each person's way, so there are no
particularly fixed rules. However, I have named it "Ryōri Monogatari" (Tales of Cooking) because it records
the stories people have told, preserving what has been heard and passed down from ancient times until today.
The rare delicacies from distant provinces and famous places must number in the tens of millions.
Tomorrow too, there will be things to hear and see.
I shall write down interesting things that come to pass.
The fish and birds of mountains, fields, rivers, and seas all emerge from nothingness—
an inexhaustible treasure born and nurtured by rain and dew.
Their forms are various and limitless, so who can count

or measure them? Even among things known today, I preserve those that are
favorable, though I may forget some beautiful ones.
These are merely general observations—spring scenery, travel skies—written
in my leisure time as my brush moved freely. However,
since I do not know these matters in detail, I should
inquire about oral traditions from those who are knowledgeable. Written in Sayama, Musashi Province.

Published on an auspicious day in early summer of Keian 2 (1649), year of the Earth Ox.

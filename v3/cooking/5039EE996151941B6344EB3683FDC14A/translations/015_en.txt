- Brown rice: 1 sho (approx. 1.8 liters) - cook slightly harder than regular rice
- Water: 3 sho (approx. 5.4 liters) - heat in a hand pail
- Koji: 3 go (approx. 540ml)
  Combine the above three ingredients and prepare in a vat, keep warm
  Stir once on the 7th day, then continue stirring for about 3 weeks
  This way it will turn out well

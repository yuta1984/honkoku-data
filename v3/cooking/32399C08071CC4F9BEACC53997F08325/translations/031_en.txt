Fresh turban shells are quite difficult to extract the meat from. To extract it, first put water in a bowl or dish, place two thin pieces of bamboo or wood across it, place the turban shell with its lid side down so it can see the water's reflection, and the shell will naturally emerge on its own. At that moment, quickly pull it out.

○Technique to Know for Grilling Turban Shells in Their Shells
At the seashore, turban shells are grilled in what is called "shimasaki" style. At that time, the meat separates from the shell and flies out, traveling five or six ken (about 30-36 feet), and if it hits a person, it can wound them with its shell like a crossbow bolt. This is frightening. First, when you intend to grill turban shells, put salt or soy sauce inside the shell, place a small fire on top of the shell, and then grill it. Even with freshly caught live turban shells, they will not fly out. This is the secret method for grilling turban shells.

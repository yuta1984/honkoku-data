Refined white sugar　　1 kan-me
Chinese yam (peeled and grated)　200 me

Mix these well together, gradually add 450 me of water, and place over fire.
When the sugar comes to a boil, remove from heat and let it rest for a while. The impurities will solidify and float to the surface. At that time, scoop them out with a metal mesh ladle, and if you boil it once more, any remaining impurities will float to the top. Remove all the impurities, strain through cloth, and store in a jar. ○Rock sugar syrup can be made in the same manner.

○Method for Agemaki
Glutinous rice flour (cold-processed)　1 gō
White sugar　　　　　　　　　　　　30 me

Knead these two ingredients well together. Add well-cooked azuki beans (keeping them whole) to strained white kidney bean flour, knead with sugar water into rounds, wrap with the above mixture, form into rod shapes, wrap in bamboo bark, steam, cool, and slice for use.

○Manufacturing Method for Cold-Processed Flour
For both glutinous rice and non-glutinous rice, select the finest white rice and soak for seven days.
However, change the water once every two days. After seven days, grind with a stone mill, strain out the dregs, put back into a tub and let settle for about two days, drain the water, lay paper on koji lids, place the rice on top and dry until firm. It will not become infested with insects even after many years.

Udon flour

For these three items, first add a little water to white sugar and stir, boil well until it becomes thick and syrupy, then add the roasted black beans and mix well. Dust with udon flour and slowly roast in a copper flat pan over low heat. When well dried, dip again in sugar syrup, lift out, dust with udon flour, and roast again in the pan. By repeating this process about five or six times, it becomes fully cooked.

Use only the fire from above. When appropriately colored, turn upside down and bake again. When finished, place in a covered container where it will steam and become perfectly textured.

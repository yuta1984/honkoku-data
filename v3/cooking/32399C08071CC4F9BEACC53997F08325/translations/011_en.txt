Asparagus cochinchinensis (fresh) - Steam thoroughly and remove the skin, extracting the core. When thoroughly steamed, the skin peels off easily. Cut the well-steamed asparagus lengthwise and remove the inner core, then boil it again thoroughly in hot water. Mix one ryō of finely powdered alum into one shō of lye made from early rice straw, stir well, soak in this water for three days, then remove and rinse with clear water. After this, reduce with sugar using the previously mentioned method.

Instead of the aforementioned alum, long pepper may also be used.

Pine greens - However, use only the new shoots that emerge from pine buds in late spring.

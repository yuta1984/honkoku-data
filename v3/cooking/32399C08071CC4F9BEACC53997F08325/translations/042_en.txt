○Explanation of the magnetic stone
When testing a magnetic stone, it appears that one stone naturally possesses the six cardinal positions. {{Upper-lower, east-west, south-north - these are called the six cardinal directions}} To test this: rub the north pole of the magnet on the needle's point, rub the south pole of the magnet on the needle's eye, thread this needle horizontally through a lamp wick and float it on water - the needle point will indicate north. Also, if you rub the east pole of the magnet on the needle point and the west pole on the eye, when floated on water it will lie horizontally pointing east. If you rub the southwest (kon) and northeast (gon) poles of the magnet, it will float diagonally. The southeast-northwest (sonken) works the same way.

To determine the magnetic stone's orientation, use a timepiece to feel around the stone's circumference - like attracts like, so at the north position the compass needle's point will face toward it, and at the south position the needle's fork will face toward it. ○In the Honzo Komoku (Compendium of Materia Medica), Zongshi's theory states it "tends toward the bing position" - this appears to be based on observations using a needle with its point rubbed against the bing direction and its eye rubbed against the jin direction of the magnet.

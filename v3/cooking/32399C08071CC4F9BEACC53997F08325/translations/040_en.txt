○Art of copying ceiling paintings
When copying paintings or writings pasted on high ceilings from below, it is difficult to copy while looking up stroke by stroke. To copy these, place a mirror face up below - the ceiling paintings or writings will be clearly reflected in it. One should copy by looking at this reflection. Truly marvelous.

Do this in the same way as described above: grate the pickled vegetables, mix with an appropriate amount of sake, and slowly cook over charcoal fire. Then add one cup each of sake and soy sauce, and simmer over low heat. When the cooking is done, remove the pot from heat, fan it outside with a fan to cool it well, add a little white sugar, and knead well by hand until it becomes roughly chopped. Press this down slightly. Also, wash miso-pickled vegetables well in water, cut them appropriately, and mix water and sake in equal proportions.

Cook over charcoal fire, then cool. Next, prepare takuan-pickled daikon in the same manner, but cook this one in sake only. Grate fresh ginger into this mixture and cook. Cool this well too, knead by hand, combine everything together, and mix well. This is how to make daikon denbu (seasoned grated daikon).

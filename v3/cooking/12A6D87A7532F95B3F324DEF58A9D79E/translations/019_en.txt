29. How to make three-variety mixed daikon
For the first of the three varieties, grate fresh ginger
and mix it into grated daikon. For the second variety, cut water-pickled fragrant vegetables
as thin as needles and wash once or twice in water. For the third variety, cut raw
daikon into plum blossoms, cherry blossoms, matsukawa-bishi (diamond pattern), or anything else
you can think of, and soak in plum vinegar for
about half an hour until well colored. However, if you also add
a little sake to this, it becomes even more beautiful. Separate these three colors
into bowls, sprinkle a little sake over them, and also sprinkle dried bonito flakes
before serving.

30. How to cut spiral daikon
Cut daikon into pieces about two sun long, peel the outer skin, and make thin spiral
peels. For this too, soak the daikon in lukewarm water
before peeling. When finished peeling, roll it back up like
paper scrolls, roll tightly, cut thinly from the end,
and when placed directly in water, it opens up in spirals.
Therefore this is called spiral daikon. There are
various ways to use it.

Preface to Cooking Self-Study
The crane carving techniques (ceremonial cooking methods) of noble households cannot be glimpsed or understood unless one belongs to such families. The uses of sea bass from Songjiang or ginger from Shu in distant China cannot be tasted unless one travels to those lands.
The menu arrangements recorded here were compiled by relying on certain cooking masters, selecting all manner of rare and interesting approaches, and widely gathering even the cooking methods held as secrets. Therefore, even if one is an amateur, upon reading this once, one can immediately comprehend and easily accomplish cooking, like searching the bottom of a quick-cooking pot. Without toil, one can easily grasp the profound secrets - this shall be like the Six Secret Teachings (military strategy text) for culinary artists.

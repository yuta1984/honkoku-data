Side Dishes
Persimmon dengaku, burdock skewers with fried tofu, miso-glazed and grilled

Chrysanthemum flowers, chrysanthemum leaves, kelp, flower shark shells - all with fried tofu; pressed tofu, yuba, grilled sweet potato, firm texture - various innovations

Clear Soup
Second course soup with accompanying vegetables - various innovations should be made according to seasonal appropriateness

Konjac cut in rectangles with fried tofu, light blue kelp, Koshu plums; perilla seeds, torn wheat gluten, salt water, white sea bream shells

Mock matsutake uses long eggplant, made like this - cut thinly from small ones, drain the liquid and add to soup, then serve as is; garnish with yuzu

Water shield, lily bulbs, day lily buds, bones; duck melon with batter coating, oak chestnuts with batter coating - various innovations

Appetizers
From these innovations, various interesting dishes have emerged. However, making imitation eggs with Chinese yam, turning mountain yam into kamaboko, making roasted fish roe, etc. are not good practices.

On an inkstone lid, arrange three to five items together, or simmered familiar foods, or vinegared dishes - nothing is sufficient by itself. Also, depending on personal preferences, for vegetarian cuisine, fried tofu and Asakusa nori should not be omitted.

Final Course Section
These are light refreshments served between the second and third main courses.

Juko Mochi (Pearl Light Rice Cake)
Boil flattened rice cake and serve in a bowl, top with three-measure miso sauce, and sprinkle sugar on top.

Yellow-White Mochi
Boil flattened rice cake and serve, sprinkle with sugar and place well-ground black sesame on top.

Sansho Mochi: 1 monme of ground sansho pepper, 1 to of glutinous rice, 3 go of miso well-ground with 1 kin of sugar - knead together, steam and flatten.

Sweet Potato Mochi: Boil Chinese yam, remove skin, grind with sugar, add a little salt, form into balls, dust with kudzu powder and steam.

Tororo (Grated Yam): Grate mountain yam, use 6 parts glutinous rice and 4 parts regular rice flour, knead with grated yam and roll out like udon noodles. Serve in clear broth.

Forcing too much sake is not appropriate.
"Sake cannot be consumed," as even heavy drinkers say.

With the host's preferences, there are various treats.
Though udon and soba noodles may be served, since they are substantial dishes, one can become full and multiple servings become burdensome.
Simply serving light steamed sweets for appearance's sake is also good.

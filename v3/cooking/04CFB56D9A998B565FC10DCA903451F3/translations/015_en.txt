○Even when creating interesting menu arrangements and combinations, if the seasoning and proportions are not good, no matter how much effort is put in or how much gold and silver is spent on ingredients, it will be to no avail. Overly elaborate and strange dishes may displease certain guests. The seasoning should simply be refreshingly balanced.

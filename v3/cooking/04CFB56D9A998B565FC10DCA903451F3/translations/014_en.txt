Originally, cooking in Japan began in the age of the gods with the deity Ukemochi-no-kami. In ancient times, sacrificial offerings were prepared, and the detailed development we see today began when Shogun Yoshimitsu established protocols, with Imagawa Ujiyori defining the ceremonial methods, making them more elaborate.

【Guidelines for Vegetarian Cuisine】

Although seasonal sections exist in menu planning, since the timing varies according to the year's climate - with spring ingredients flourishing in winter or autumn's first harvests ending in summer - it is essential to consider the sequence of seasons and arrange menus and combinations accordingly.

○There is no difference in cooking methods between vegetarian dishes and those with fish and fowl. For example, fish white dumplings can be replaced with tofu white dumplings, and flower shrimp can be substituted with tied kelp.

○When a dish is completed without fault in its combinations, proportions, cutting methods, and presentation, it should feel like a sudden evening shower during the intense heat of summer. However, since customers have different preferences - some may enjoy the cooling shower but dislike the thunder - the art of cooking is extremely difficult to master.

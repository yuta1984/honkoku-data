Put it in a donburi bowl, sprinkle the aforementioned grated daikon over it, and let it rest for a while. During this time, prepare thin miso soup. Then grind the aforementioned grated daikon in a mortar, gradually add the miso soup to make it slightly firmer than tororo (grated yam), prepare clear soup in another pot, and when it comes to a boil, scoop in the daikon with a metal ladle. After one boil, serve it in bowls along with the broth. The condiments for this are: finely chopped chinpi (dried citrus peel), finely chopped green onions or chives, finely chopped asakusa nori seaweed, or alternatively, serve with finely julienned red pepper.

(7) Method for Daikon Oyashiro-ni (Great Shrine Simmering) - Specialty of Unshu Province
First, this is an October dish. Use daikon leaves and stems, or whole daikon still long, taking only those that look like they're covered with soil, and cook with the leaves still attached. Then lay about two sheets of flat kelp on the bottom of a large pot, and you may add as much daikon as seems appropriate. Then add a handful of white soybeans, a little sake, soy sauce and water, making plenty of broth to simmer. Then serve on flat dishes. However, fold the leaves carefully so they don't break, and serve two pieces at a time. ▲This is for October, when all of Japan [goes] to Izumo Grand Shrine

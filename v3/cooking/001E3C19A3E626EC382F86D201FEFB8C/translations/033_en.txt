The root hairs are few. Those growing southward are large. This is the principle of natural law.
Or when traveling, if one loses direction while walking at night and finds a daikon field, one should pull out the daikon straight as it grows and brush off the soil to examine it. The thick and long root hairs should be understood as pointing south. One can surely find the way. Now, shojin-namasu (vegetarian namasu) also has significance. Shojin, like namasu, is written as "moon gathering." In Buddhist services, it is taboo until the first anniversary. The gatherings that gradually accumulate years and months from the third year onward represent the heart of remembrance. Also, arranged namasu and sashimi are all places where the five elements gather - wood, fire, earth, metal, water - where heaven, water, and earth converge, in yin-yang unity, and they represent and show the spirit of Mount Sumeru and the great ocean. Therefore, arranged namasu is served at weddings and other celebrations, or at auspicious distant memorial Buddhist services. Furthermore, attaching two daikon pickles to a meal tray is said to have the efficacy of a hundred flavors. If one eats these pickles in the morning, they dispel the day's worries. Therefore, from the highest nobility down to all the people, pickles remain unchanged. Using leafy daikon in cooking represents the spirit of decorating with two-leaf aoi (hollyhock). Also, attaching two represents heaven and earth, yin and yang, night and day, male and female.

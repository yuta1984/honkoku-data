In Izumo, on the first day of the tenth month, households that have welcomed a son-in-law or bride especially cook this daikon to celebrate. The reason for offering daikon with leaves attached to the gods also comes from this tradition. Details are recorded in the final volume.

(8) Method for Daikon Awayuki-jiru (Light Snow Soup)
First, wrap soft tofu in cloth and let it drain for a while.
Peel winter daikon, grate it coarsely, and drain the water. If you have about two go of the tofu, use about five go of grated daikon, mix them well together, then dissolve about one and a half small dishes of finest kudzu powder in water and mix this in as well.
Then bring water to a boil in a pot, add the mixture and cook. However, when it finishes cooking, remove the lid immediately. Also prepare miso soup in another pot. For this, in tea cuisine use jinta miso, red miso, usudare, tama miso, or depending on the dish, white miso is also good. In any case, when it comes to a boil, scoop it out with a metal ladle and serve.

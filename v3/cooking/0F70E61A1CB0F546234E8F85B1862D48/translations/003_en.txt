Preface
1. This book is based on the manuscript by Fūra Sanjin, a hermit scholar of Tōmei. Now, at the request of a person of determination, we supplement the unclear aspects of the preparation methods and publish it.

2. The seasonal dishes, rare dishes, etc. in the volume are the author's own innovations, so without being bound by ancient books, the preparation methods are displayed at the end of the volume. There should be other creative intentions as well.

3. All various dishes are divided into sections, and one should study them by entering their respective categories.

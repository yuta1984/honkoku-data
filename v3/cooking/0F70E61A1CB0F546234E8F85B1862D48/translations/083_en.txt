1. Urahaku dried skin: Soak dried abalone or monkfish skin in water until
   soft, boil in hot water, then spread fish paste on the back side,
   briefly boil again and use. However, urahaku jellyfish and urahaku
   shiso are prepared the same way. {{Side note: Found in the second soup section}}

1. Nikumochi (meat dumpling) skin: Spread fish paste on a board, steam well,
   briefly expose to fire, and when making from time to time, peel off thinly,
   then repeat the same process many times on the remaining portion. Cut the skin
   into strips and control the heat so it doesn't burn.

   However, if it becomes difficult to peel off sheet by sheet,
   it's also good to attach it to a thin board and cut it into single sheets. {{Side note: Found in the sashimi section}}

1. Ogawa-tataki: With any fish, fillet into three pieces, scrape the flesh
   and pound it well, wrap in green kaya grass or straw bundle, briefly
   blanch in hot water, and layer on thin wooden boards for use. {{Side note: Same as above}}

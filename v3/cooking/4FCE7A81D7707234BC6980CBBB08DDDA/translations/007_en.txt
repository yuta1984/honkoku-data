　　　　　Regarding Tosa wheat gluten (fu)
1. For Tosa fu, stretch it thoroughly until it becomes soft and gelatinous, then add wheat flour in a standing mixture proportion. For ten pieces of fu, add about three cups of wheat flour. Bring the water to a full boil and cook. If the fire is too weak, it will cook unevenly, which is bad. When cooked well, foam will form, and as it gradually cooks down, the foam will disappear.

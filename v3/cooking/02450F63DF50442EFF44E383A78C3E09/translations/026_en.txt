For late-night guests, or guests when there are no prepared dishes, or when 
all the arranged dishes have been served and nothing remains,
when one or two dishes must be hastily prepared, here are some simple
ideas provided for reference.

【Clear Soup】
　To ordinary miso soup, reheat with dried firefly squid, strain out the dregs, and use rice bran miso
　pickled old eggplant cut thin lengthwise from the tip, boil out the salt and
　add two or three slices, knead high-grade kudzu with boiling water, pinch it in, and
　flatten it with your hands before adding. However, it's better to dissolve the kudzu in boiling water before adding.

【Clear Soup】
　Make light dashi and well-washed large pickled plum
　one piece, add grated wasabi.
　　　　Also good to add enoki mushrooms, shimeji, or shiitake mushrooms.

【Clear Soup】
　Grated mountain yam with a little kudzu powder mixed in and pinched in, yuzu
　peel with the top cut off and reshaped, one piece. Can be made with red miso or
　clear broth. Crumble Asakusa nori and sprinkle a little.

【Rice Bowl Dish】
　Deep-fry kaki-mochi (rice crackers) in sesame oil, and pour
　scallion miso thinned with sake.

【Individual Serving Plate】
　Mix grated wasabi, pickled plum flesh, and bonito flakes
　finely shaved, pound well together, and sprinkle with
　a little soy sauce. This is called nishikigi.

【Similar Topping】
　Roast premium tea well and crumble finely,
　shave bonito flakes with a tea bowl scraper until
　it becomes powder. Mix this together and sprinkle with a little soy sauce.

　　　However, like ume-kaga, use very
　　　little soy sauce, just enough to moisten. Best to
　　　heat over low fire and cook briefly.

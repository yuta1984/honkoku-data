《Title: Shippoku Cuisine Section》

Fucha and shippoku are similar types of cuisine, but fucha is Buddhist vegetarian cuisine that uses oil throughout to create delicious flavors. Shippoku uses fish and seafood for cooking, and while the preparation methods are not particularly different from regular kaiseki cuisine, since it borrows foreign names, it is essential to pay attention to the style and choice of serving vessels. Among the several dishes prepared, it is considered good to devise rare and delicious items such as kenchin, unusual molded dishes, shinjo (fish paste balls), and fish dengaku. However, fucha is preferred by non-drinkers, while shippoku should be understood as a style that encourages drinking. Generally, because of the foreign names, there is a common misunderstanding that the dishes should be exotic, leading to the grave error of serving only dishes that do not encourage drinking at all.

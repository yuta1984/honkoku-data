Add this and it will be good. Generally, whether more or less, this proportion is fine. However, in summer, use a little more Ako salt. When serving vinegar as is, squeeze out and discard vinegar that had fish soaked in it, and separately prepare fresh mixture as described above. The flavor should be lighter than three-cup vinegar.

○Millet Sea Bream: Wash a large sea bream well, wipe off moss, fillet one side, grind glutinous millet onto the filleted side, steam in a steamer, and serve with light-flavored soba broth. However, soak the millet well in water beforehand, drain it, and pile it to the height of the fillet. Serve it in a bowl just as steamed.

○Obaku Steamed Buns
These differ greatly from ordinary steamed buns, and the preparation of the filling is crucial. Boil new adzuki beans well and make smooth paste like strained bean paste, squeeze very well, add roasted sesame, oil a pan with sesame oil and stir-fry the paste very thoroughly until it becomes crumbly like roasted sesame, let cool well, remove dust from coarse white sugar, knead raw sugar into the paste so it becomes moist like ordinary bean paste with the moisture from white sugar, knead high-quality wheat flour to soba consistency, wrap the filling inside, shape like ordinary steamed buns, place in a castella pan with fire lid on top and bake, then place on a roasting rack. However, this fire control is extremely important and difficult to describe in writing. Practice many times to master the technique.
　　　　The skin of these buns becomes like flower crumbs. Cut from the end and serve. Even if left for a hundred days in summer, they will not spoil.

The above three volumes record the essentials of cooking. Beyond this, for formal cuisine such as banquet meals, shichi-go-san celebrations, gold and silver formal meals, wedding ceremonies, religious festivals and other ceremonial procedures, I desire to publish a sequel and make it a complete cooking compendium. The sequel will be published within a few days.

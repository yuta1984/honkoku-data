Methods for Preserving Various Vegetables《marginal note: same for salt pickling》

Bracken (Warabi)
　Take freshly picked bracken, remove any rotten parts well, spread ash in a long box, lay straw on top of that, and place the bracken flat. Cover again with straw and sprinkle ash on top, repeating this layering process multiple times. Close the box lid and seal it with paste. When taken out and used in winter, the taste will be unchanged from freshly picked spring bracken.

Plum Blossoms
　Mix open flowers with buds, cut the flower stems long, fill a lidded bowl-like container about half full with salt and press it flat. Insert the flower stems into this salt as if planting them. Seal the lid with paste. When taken out in summer, they will look as if just bloomed.

Butterbur Sprouts (Fuki-no-tou)
　Sift Arakida soil finely, mix with rice bran and put in a box. Take butterbur sprouts that haven't yet sprouted, including stems, place them in the soil, cover with more soil on top, and seal the lid with paste.

Green Yuzu Citrus
Note: after flowers have fallen
　Take rice paste and spread it well over the post-bloom yuzu, apply gold leaf thickly, wrap and place in a jar with sealed lid. When taking out for use, soak in water and wash off the leaf well - the fragrance won't escape and the color won't change.

Green Japanese Pepper (Sansho)
　Boil salt, let it cool well, put it in a jar, pickle the green sansho in this, seal the jar lid with paste, and the color will remain green indefinitely.
　　Note: green yuzu can be preserved in salt the same way

First Eggplant
　Take good-colored eggplant without any moisture, mix salt with blue sand, and pickle the first eggplant in a bucket. The bucket should definitely be sealed. When taking out for use, remove the salt.

Green Plum
　Soak in bracken ash lye overnight - don't worry that it turns tea-colored. Remove from the lye, dry the moisture well, then pickle in salt as usual with a well-fitted lid and light weight.

　　　How to Make Ayu (Sweetfish) Pickled in Sake Lees

First, open the belly of large ayu and salt them as they are. However, if you wash them with water, the ayu's fragrance will be lost. Salt them for one day and one night, then the next day, wash them with that salt water and let them drain. Then take 500 me of sake lees and 5 gō of new black rice, cook it into rice, let it cool well, and mix it thoroughly with the sake lees. Arrange the ayu in single rows and place the lees-rice mixture on them. The pickling method is like ordinary sushi: cover with paper, sprinkle a little salt on top, close the lid tightly, paste paper over the joints to prevent air from entering, and pickle for about ten days. When using, wash with water. This is excellent for sashimi, side dishes, daihibiki dishes, clear soups (with appropriate garnishes), ichijū-nisai meals, and moriko-boshi tea cuisine.

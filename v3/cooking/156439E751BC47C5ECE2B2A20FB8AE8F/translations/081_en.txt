　　　Method for Steamed Eggs with Tofu Lees
One: Stir-fry tofu lees with soy sauce. Into this, add finely chopped chili pepper and finely ground Japanese pepper as seasonings. Then heat sesame oil in a pot, crack eggs into it, and quickly fry them. Immediately place them into the aforementioned lees and steam. In Nagasaki, it is said that a little starch syrup is added to this mixture. This is also good. This dish is suitable for tea cuisine.

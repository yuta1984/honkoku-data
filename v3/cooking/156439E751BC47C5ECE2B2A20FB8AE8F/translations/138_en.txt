Method for Making Nagasaki Loach Soup
1. Medium-sized loach is best. Warm some sake slightly, put the loach in it, and cover with a lid for a while. The loach will straighten out, so cut off the tail and head, dry them slightly, and quickly fry in sesame oil. Make a clear soup slightly on the salty side, add shaved burdock and julienned konnyaku, which should also be lightly seasoned with soy sauce beforehand, and add finely chopped daikon radish. For aromatic garnish, add finely chopped garlic and Japanese pepper.

Alternatively, serve in small dishes with chili miso sauce. For accompaniments, serve young green onions, lotus, lotus potato, or julienned daikon radish. Adding black pepper is also good. It's also excellent when made into a rich soup or added to miso-simmered somen noodles.

Method for Grilling Eel
1. Split the eel and immediately pour sake over it. Cook it once over fire, then pour soy sauce over it the second time. If it's a large eel, pierce it many times from the skin side with bamboo skewers, and pour sake and soy sauce over it about three times.

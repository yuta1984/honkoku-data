　　　How to Make Shrimp Soba
1. Shell Ise lobster raw, remove the thin membrane, pound thoroughly to make surimi. If you have one rice bowl full, add one and a half cups of buckwheat flour, knead together with the surimi to form dumpling-like shapes. If the surimi is too firm, add about three egg whites and knead together. From here, roll it out like regular soba noodles and cut it the same way as soba. If it sticks to the knife, sprinkle kudzu powder before cutting. For the boiling water, add a little salt, a little white sugar, and about five walnuts with shells in a bag to make the broth. Remove the walnuts, add the soba, remove the lid and boil. When they float to the surface, scoop them up with a metal ladle and cool in water. When serving in bowls, put them back in the boiling water briefly before serving. For the sauce, thicken with kudzu and make it slightly sweet. Also suitable for sashimi, flat dishes, confection bowls, and soups with red miso, goto miso, clear broth, and other combinations - especially good for tea cuisine.
